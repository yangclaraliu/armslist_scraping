The SBX features a more slim design with a thicker strap for extra stability. This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil when using an AR-style pistol. Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0” – 1.2” in diameter.
The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.Call or text REDACTED"

Springfield XD 40 Sub Compact extreme duty. This came with a 9 round stainless concealment mag, a 12 round stainless X-Tension mag, and a mag loader that locks onto the magazine. It also came with 2 holsters, one for the gun and one for the 2 clips, making it a little more expensive than the typical gun in a case. Added to that is a pinky extension for the conceilment mag which improves the grip without sacrificing conceilment, another 12 round stainless mag, and a windage and elevation adjustable Crimson Trace laser grip (very expensive, about $300) with the beavertail extension on the back of the grip. Plus a second gun holster from Springfield Armory XD Gear. This gun has an ambidextrous mag release and a beefy dual recoil spring. It has a full length guide rod that keeps the slide in battery when pressed against someones chest during a standoff. The 3 dot sights are steel. The forged steel slide is Melonite coated. The hammer forged carbon steel 1:16 right hand twist barrel is Melonite coated. All metal parts are Tenifer Plus+ treated. The loaded barrel indicator on the top of the slide and the cocked striker indicator on the back of the slide eliminate the daily ritual of removing the mag and racking the slide. The grip safety also locks the slide if it were released. It also has a 5 1/2 lb Glock style USA safety trigger, a drop safety, and accessory mounting rail. It's not a burden to carry. Target aquisition is quick. The laser naturally comes on when you put your hand on the grips. A great deal at $550 for the gun, laser, and holster. The price is firm and I'm not interested in any trades. REDACTED"

The rear sight slider was damaged beyond repair when we got it so we made a new one and stuck it in there. It shoots very good and the sights line up great. It is a 357 mag so you could shoot the 38 spls in it if you dont want all the recoil. This would make a great addition to anyones collection. Come by today and check out this amazing firearm.

This revolver has worn finish from carry, but its mechanics are excellent. Cylinder timing is spot-on and it locks up like a bank vault. The bore is bright with good rifling. The lack of flame cutting on the topstrap indicates the revolver was carried much more than it was fired. I'm guessing the M.S.P. stamp on the bottom of the grip frame may indicate it was a Montana State Patrol duty weapon. There is no rust or pitting I can see and there are no cracks in the frame or barrel. The serial number range, 374XX, indicates a 1955 manufacture date. An ideal 6 shot lightweight carry revolver.

Jewel Trigger set at 15 oz, and a Remington action.  It has a NightForce 5.5 x 22 x 56 scope.  With a sun shade extender on the scope.  The only flaw on the entire gun is a slight scratch on the reticle as you look through the scope.  I spoke with nightforce and it can be buffed out for a couple hundred dollars.  IT is a hunting rifle and has no effect on the performance.  I have hunted for 10 years in Canada with this gun, It is not just a show piece it is a hunting machine.  Brand new this is a gun valued at over $7000.  I am offering it shipping included anywhere in the U.S for $5200."

There is a trench in the red dot that allows co-witness should the optic fail, however many prefer this setup because the absence of a large rear sight allows a better sight picture through the optic.You need to be willing to sign a bill of sale and must provide a valid Florida CCW license.I got it as a collection piece but could use the money right now, the battery is in the optic and the gun has 15 rounds through it to test function."

It was purchased in 1979 from Gart Bros. store. Originally this model was sold by sears robuck under the J.C. Higgins name and endorsed by Ted Williams. Then Sears discontinued firearms. Winchester had all these shotgun barrels sitting around with Ted Williams & J.C. Higgins stamped on the barrel. Sporting goods stores purchased some and Winchester crosshatched out the names but if you look closely you can still see the Williams and Higgins name on the breech of the barrel. Anyway, I would call the gun 99 % good.  20 gauge pump with multi choke. Barrel is like new. Email for more info. Local sales only or can arrange meeting place. thanks, John"
