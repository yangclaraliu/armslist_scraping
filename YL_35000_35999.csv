Also, please do not e-mail me asking what my ""best price"" is--I will not negotiate with myself so simply e-mail me with a reasonable offer!

For sale is an excellent condition, unmodified Springfield Armory Mil-spec chambered in .45ACP.

Just over 500 rounds shot through it (514 to be precise) so it's nice and loosened up.
Never dropped.
No failures of any kind ever experienced.
Never carried in a holster so wear is minimal--I've simply added some minor wear so you don't have to!
Details on the wear: Some slight brassing near the ejection port (normal and probably unnoticeable) and some brass-looking marks on the left side of the slide near the barrel (from accidental contact with a spare magazine in my range bag).
Apart from these minor cosmetic signs of wear this weapon is in perfect fighting condition, never been tinkered with and is broken in with a smooth action.

Item comes as it did originally--2 mags, box, complete paper work and accessories (SA holster and mag holster) and key.

I will ship from FFL to FFL if you live out of state but please add $50 (what my FFL will charge) and buyer to pay actual shipping.

It is a LS package so it has power windows, locks, tilt, cruise, a/c (ice cold), split bench seat with console, and full carpet on the floor. 

Pros, 

This truck is a two owner vehicle, the first owner being my father, purchased new at lubbers in Cheney, the second being me approx 3 years ago. It is a very trustworthy truck! I recently drove it to Clarksville, AR 900 + miles round trip and would not hesitate to take it anywhere! Truck gets approx 25 mpg, it has good tires on it, the engine runs good, the tranny shifts as it should, a new clutch assy installed approx 1.5 years ago, at that time the fly wheel was turned, and a new throw out bearing and slave cylinder installed. It has a receiver hitch installed on the with a 4 flat pin wiring connector. The truck does not leak any kind of fluid and has no mechanical issues that I am aware of. 

Cons, 

The truck is almost 10 years old and it does have dings, dents, scrapes and scratches. The interior is clean but there are a couple of cigarette burns in the seat from my father but there is no smoke smell at all in the truck. The windshield has a crack low going across it that is not in line of vision, and the fan switch does not operate on 1 or 2 but 3-4-5 and all other switch function work fine. I have asked a couple of mechanics and they tell me it is most likely in the switch but I have not purchased on as of yet.

Occasionally, I take guns as trades towards my bikes.  I also have purchased a few myself.  Over the past year or so though, I haven't had the extra time to shoot much at all.  I don't hunt so all of my shooting is just recreational.  It is a shame to let these just sit there with such little use.  Here is what I am willing to let go.  You are welcome to make offers, but I am not money trouble and I will not give them away.  I am very meticulous with my guns and I take very good care of them.  They are nice guns.  I might take trades.  I can trade up or down for ATVs, boats, jet skis, maybe a zero turn mower, ect?  I am really not looking for any other guns at the moment except maybe an XDM.  Here is a list of what I have left.

Hi Point 380, 3 mags, hardcase, factory lock, the only thing I did to this was polish the feed ramp on it.  It doesn't jam up unless you limp wrist it or shoot aluminum casing through it.  Winchester White Box works best. - $200

Benelli Nova 12ga. pump, Advantage cammo, I have an extra choke with it.  This was $479 new, $400

Mossberg 500 tactical 12 ga. pump, it has a few extra on it.  I don't know a lot about this one.  Has a glass sight on it and the stock holds some extra shells.  It has a few handling marks on it as well. - $350

Hopefully this will appeal to some of you weirdos out there.

I have, for your consideration, four replica black powder shooters, in working order, and one genuine wall hanger from the 1880s. The pics make them look rusty, but they are not. Well, the relic is.

The long one on top is a 45 caliber precussion cap. Good for you mountianeers, or folks thinking about heading west to get some of that gold. It was made in Spain by Jukar. Ready to shoot. $150

The next one from the top is the old one. It is only marked ""AJAX ARMY"" on the top, with bulldogs on the grips. I believe it is 44 Webely, not 44 rimfire. It was sold by the E. C. Meacham Company of St. Louis, MO, some time around 1882 to 1899, as I inderstand it. I believe it was actually made by Johnson & Bye Gunsmith who later became Iver Johnson's Arms & Cycle Works. Maybe you've heard of them. Anyway it is NOT a shooter, nor will it ever be able to be MADE a shooter. It's just for looking at, hanging on the wall, what have you, which is why it is a whopping $25.

Upper is chambered for 5.56x45, so will easily handle either .223 or the hotter 5.56 depending on your preference.  Lower is multi-cal marked, with pictograph safety selector symbols (think HK rifles).

As a standalone product, the rapidly-convertible MS2 allows an operator to leverage the maneuverability of Single-PointÂ® attachment for direct-action, or two-point attachment for stability. Single-hand adjustments, quick-detach lanyard and positive-locking metal hardware provide flexibility and durability in a truly adaptable sling system.

Used in conjunction with the Magpul ASAPÂ® plate (sold separately), the MS2 enables seamless transitions into an array of shooting positions without getting bound or fouled. The MS2 concept allows switching from Weapon Shoulder to Reaction Shoulder for shooting around corners, under vehicles, or to minimize exposure. The MS2 can also increase operator survivability by keeping the weapon in the fight in case of injury to the operator's shoulder, arm, or hand.


>> Features <<

Fast transition from Single-PointÂ® to two-point configuration
Adjustment Loop for rapidly adding or removing sling tension with a single-hand
Quick-detach lanyard provides emergency weapon release
Sling Mounting
REAR - Works with the Magpul ASAPÂ® for optimal transitioning in Single-PointÂ® mode. Also compatible with most snap-hook style sling connectors.
FRONT - Compatible with most full sling swivels/loops for two-point use.

Looking to trade for a .22 LR pistol or revolver.

This gun functions fine, has a shiny bore but is rusty on the outside. It desperately needs a refinish but I thought I'd see if anyone wanted to trade before I started the project. I have plenty of .22 rifles but not that many handguns in the caliber.

It has a tubular magazine in the stock and the top of the action is grooved to accept Weaver-style scope rings.

The rifle probably dates back to the late 1950s or early 1960s. Some good info about the line is here: http://home.epix.net/~damguy/Moss-cross.htm and you can buy parts from here (although this rifle needs nothing other than a refinish): http://www.havlinsales.com/

If you like we can even arrange to meet at a range so you can shoot it."

Need to part with this handgun, and not without hesitation. Roommate skipped town and now I'm up shit creek for 1100 bucks in two months so I need money fairly quickly. Bought this gun from my cousin a couple months back, and it's a fantastic shooter.

Sig P226 in .357Sig (You can buy .40S&W caliber barrels to put in them for two guns in one. Use the same mags.) Come with 40 rounds of GoldDot defense ammo, Blackhawk IWB nylon hoslter (quality and very safe for nylon) Blackhawk double mag pouch, 3x 12rd Sig Factory magazines (one factory 10rd magazine as well not pictured), and the original factory as well as replacement Hogue wrap around grips. Case included as well. The sights are bright white, standard factory.

$750. Cash only. Need to sell this within a week if possible. I work seven days a week so I don't have time to travel far outside of Wichita to make a deal. The gun is in fantastic condition with only one noticeable flaw and that is a slight discoloration on the top of the barrel. I think it is just a hint of surface rust that could be buffed out with just a touch to a muslin buffer wheel.

Email, Text or Call. Leave a voicemail. My primary job doesn't allow me to take calls on the clock so I'll return them as soon as I can. Serious buyers only. CCH permit, or Public Safety personnel preferred, but I don't discriminate. =)
