Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

Draco has been lightly used (<160 rounds) and has been cleaned and maintained regularly. Only reason for sale is due to the fact that my safe is over crowded. The pistol itself functions flawlessly and is an absolute blast to shoot. Comes with a threaded barrel, side charging handle, muzzle brake, 3 30rd mags, and a range bag. Last time I took it to the range I had people stacked up behind me just to watch me shoot, definitely a head turner. Trade value is 900 but cash is king. Makes an excellent trunk gun or can be easily fit in a backpack or duffel. Feel free to make me an offer as the price is (lightly) flexible within reason. I respond quickly to emails. Don't bother sending me links to buds gun shop or cheaper than dirt showing me a year old expired listing for 700, these are not easy to come by. Thanks for looking.

 The Carbine has a 16.2″ barrel fitted with a faux suppressor built specifically for CZ-USA by SilencerCo. Fitted with the factory’s folding adjustable stock, the Carbine features a number of US-made parts to make it fully 922(r) compliant. One of the nicest features of the firearm is the newly-designed forend, covered in M-LOK attachment points to keep the profile slim while still being big enough to swallow most pistol-caliber suppressors should the owner decide down the road to convert it into an SBR for use with a suppressor. Low-profile aluminum adjustable sights round out the platform, and a top Picatinny rail allows the mounting of a wide number of optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.
