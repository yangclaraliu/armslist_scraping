 NEW IN BOX
 The Kimber Bel Air Ultra II is a 3"" barrel 9mm 1911 paired with a compact frame. The stainless steel slide wears a beautiful mirror polished finish. Kimber workmanship and quality are easy to see, even down to the smallest detail. The melded forged stainless steel slide and lightweight aluminum alloy frame fit together with tight tolerances and function perfectly.
Recoil on the Kimber Bel Air Ultra II feels significantly less than that of competing designs. This is due in part to this pistol's lower center of gravity, which is slightly below the slide, and very close to where the shooter's hand grips the gun. Although the single-stack magazine puts the Kimber's capacity at only eight rounds, the relatively small diameter of the 1911's frame still allow the shooter to create a secure two-handed grip.
A match grade barrel and bushing deliver tack driving accuracy. For added reliability, Kimber includes a full- length guide rod, as the shorter G.I. style guide rods have a tendency to bind or break over time. Snag-free, low profile sights sit on top of the slide and provide a consistent target presentation.
The checkering on the mainspring housing, along with the texture of the ivory Micarta thin grips feels secure.The knurled extended magazine release of the Kimber Bel Air Ultra II is a huge improvement over releases seen on other pistols. Performing tactical reloads is quick, simple and efficient.
The Kimber Bel Air Ultra II single stage, match grade aluminum trigger is a joy to pull, especially over the mushy triggers seen on most double action pistols. The 4 to 5lbs pull is steady and smooth, while the reset is short and crisp. This is a gun that fires naturally, even for beginner's that have ""low and left"" trigger slap tendencies. In fact, the Kimber Bel Air Ultra II has one of the smoothest trigger pulls of any production 1911 on the market.
Other features include a clean, single sided thumb safety. Many shooters actually prefer this style over the bulkier ambidextrous paddles. To further minimize felt recoil, the grip safety is a high-ride designed beavertail that quickly establishes a positive grip for maximum control in stress fire situations.

Serial # 971,896 with NO prefix rather than an underlined No. Although some publications list this serial number as March 1943 production, it may have been finished after production was started again in May-June ’43 (after shutdown in Feb.) with the new on site Ordnance inspector. He designated that new production pistols would have the NO prefix to distinguish newly produced pistols. Since old receivers were used up in new production a mix of NO and No can be found in serial number range 955,000 to 1,016,000. This pistol has the Du-lite finish with some blued parts. Regulations required the same finish on the receiver and slide but parts could be other finishes. Slide is type 2 with markings 1 3/8” long and ending in N.Y.U.S.A. Type 2 slides started about #935,000. Blued High Standard barrel. P stamped on the left side of the lug, HS on the right. Bore is mirror with a little micro erosion from firing. Feed ramp is bright with traces of finish, not polished. Recoil spring plug is blued. Remington narrow hammer. Finely checkered early Remington mainspring cover. Blued checkered slide stop (Colt). Blued safety checkered on top and bottom with no undercut (Colt). Colt supplied these parts to Remington until Remington could make them. Front sight has sloped serrated ramp on rear. Rounded cut on front of rear sight with squared aperture. Early Keyes grips without re-enforcing rings around screws. No hits, bangs or smashed checkering. Bluing on pistol is about 95%. There is some wear on the top of the barrel and on other moving parts. Du-lite was not as sturdy as Parkerizing. Heat treated area on end of the slide is very visible but there is none above the slide stop."

(Solar Tactical sells a Kydex wrap if you wish to run this featureless w/o bullet button (not included)). I Put 3 boxes of factory ammo through it (WWB, Federal, and PMC) with no failures. Runs great and very accurate! This rifle wears the Troy sights which means it is a late model version with all the factory revisions. Absolutely nothing wrong with it Mechanically: 10/10 - Clean after every range session and lube with Slip2000 as recommended by Kriss Aesthetically: 9.5/10 - Has normal wear from brass bouncing off the ejection port. Only ever shot at the range so this thing never got banged around. Safe queen. Selling because I just picked up the pistol model which is what I originally wanted.

With the introduction of the P938, Sig Sauer offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single action only trigger, coupled with full-size Siglite night sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs 6+1 rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters."

I bought this a few months ago and never got it out to shoot, I was going to take it out west for some Mully hunting this year but I went with a lighter rifle instead. Never fired and just needs an optic. Original box and papers are with  Blackhawk Scope Base 20 MOA (installed) From the Savage Law Enforcement series, the Model 10 FCP-SR is a purpose built tactical rifle. This superbly accurate rifle has a free-floated 24"" barrel with a threaded barrel, and the renowned AccuTrigger adjustable trigger. An oversized bolt handle allows sure cycling even with gloved or wet hands. A Picatinny rail provides the base for optics, and the rifle is fed by a 10 round detachable box magazine. Twin swivel studs on the forend permit use of both a sling and a bipod.
