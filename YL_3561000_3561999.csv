The Glock 30SF in the legendary .45 Auto offers excellent out-of-the-box
precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big bore
caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of
the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact
dimensions, the G30SF is the first choice of plainclothes officers and
security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of
the receiver at the rear backstrap, offering increased comfort and control,
especially for shooters with smaller hands.

But you can see once installed it's totally covered by the steel end of the gas tube, and it won't affect the perfomance of the handguard.

Aimpoint Patrol Rifle Optic is designed with input from a distinguished group of current and former professionals, the Patrol Rifle Optic incorporates many never before seen features to maximize this sight's performance within the challenging conditions faced by modern law enforcement. 



A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.

The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

Unique features for Patrol Rifle Optic

• Always ready - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery.
No need to fumble with switches prior to use.
• 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances.
• In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking
and maintenance easy.
• Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared
to iron sights and magnified scopes.
• Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with
Aimpoint 3X Magnifier and Concealed Engagement unit.
• Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world
conditions and waterproof to 150 feet.
• Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD).
• Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean.
• Transparent rear flip cover allows use of the sight (with both eyes open) even with
both covers closed in an emergency.
• Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces.
• Modular mount set up for use on flat-top AR15, M4 Carbine and M16 rifles.
(Adapter available for carry handle mounting)
• Removable spacer. Remove for use on shotguns and sub-guns.
• QRP2 rail grabber mount. Snap knob three times for a perfect mount.
Will not deform your rail like many other mounts.
• Recessed lens openings helps prevent against impact damage,
fingerprints and scratches.

There appear to be Italian cartouches, including a crown, and proof marks - they are faded and shallow.  The year 1938 and the numerals ""XVIII"" are also stamped into the action.  It appears similar to the 1891 cavalry carbine.  There is no provision for a cleaning rod or mounting a bayonet.  The bluing is about 80% and there is some pitting.

A takedown version of the AR, that can be easily assembled in 40 seconds...WITH NO TOOLS!

Very small for storage and travel, with real advantages. Portability and stealth are the obvious ones, but another is that this system makes it easy and less expensive to have a multi-purpose, multi-cartridge AR. 

All you need to do is swap out a barrel, again no tools, as opposed to a whole new complete upper receiver/barrel assembly, and you have a 300 AAC Blackout.

or, change out a barrel & bolt carrier group to fire 6.8SPC, or 7.62 x 39, or .22, or others you may choose. 

In other words, for about another $600 investment you can have a rifle that fires four different calibers, ask me how...BTW that's less that $500 total investment per caliber!

 It came with a very heavy trigger (maybe 12-14#'s). B&B Arms smoothed the trigger out, and now it's a very nice 5-6 #'s. Really a fun gun and kids love it. It of course takes up very little space, and, actually will float if you drop it out of the boat.
It comes with 2 magazines, the original box, and a good trigger. I think Gander Mountain sells these for $239.99 + taxes, but, it would have a HEAVY trigger. I'm asking $220 NOW $210 for this one.

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system (14.5"" barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

1 Thumbscrew Flattop Adapter (for Picatinny Rail) (TA51)
1 killFLASH® Anti-Reflection Device (TA91)

I bought this 1911 not too long ago trying to get into the platform and it's just not for me. I have numerous Glocks, M&P's , XD's, XDM's, and PX4 Storms. Those polymer wonders are what suit me the best. I have only shot 50 rounds of ball ammo through this 1911 and it functioned 100%. I think the contour of the grip angle is what I hate the most. It just doesn't feel good in my hand at all. I think about a dozen or so positive youtube videos is what talked me into buying one. This 1911 is very robust and impressive looking up close. I paid $749.99 and $20 for the Hogue grip. After tax I was right at $830. I'm asking $550 FIRM with no tax. This will be a face to face personal transaction and I do have a CWP. I am in Summerville. It also comes with original box, two mags, and the soft Ruger gun case. I still do have the factory grips that will come with it as well. Just let me know if you are interested. I know that there are a lot of 1911 fans out there but I guess I'm just not one of them. Then again you can't be afraid to try new things. Please no trades because I need the money for other things right now. Also $550 is the lowest I can go because I'm taking a $300 loss for shooting only one box of ammo. Thanks for your interest and God Bless!!!"

It is fully functional; I have fired it a few times over the years.  According to the serial number of 350XXX, it was manufactured early in 1924, during the early prohibition era.  I like to picture it being held by Eliot Ness... it was really looking good in my display cabinet next to a Thompson reproduction I used to have!

The action works great, and the slide is quite smooth.   The receiver is steel, unlike newer shotguns that are all aluminum.  I believe the tube magazine holds 6+1.  The walnut stock and pump are beautiful - like a 100 year old piece of furniture.  There is no heavy rust or pitting, but that being said there is almost no bluing left either.  The gun has a nice patina, and is very cool looking in person.  It's also heavy, being all steel, even with the short barrel it weighs in at about 7 pounds.  The butt plate is heavy steel as well.  The recoil is not bad at all due to the weight.

Please e-mail me with your phone number if you want to come take a look.  I'm located in North Skagit County, but I work in Mt Vernon, and travel south to Seattle from time to time.   I'm going to want to see a CWP and ID for the private transfer.

I had it previously listed without the scope, but now that I have the new .308, I can let it all go together.

Rifle new is going for 430$ as per cheaper than dirts website and I cant seem to find it any cheaper than that.  
The scope is going for 229 new.  It's refiled and has excellent clarity and has held its zero since I first sighted in February  I also have a  set of butler creek flip up covers on it.  The rear is the quick push to open kind.  Those set me back about 20$
Theres a sling on it too that was 20$
The ammo was 25$ from wal mart.

Im asking 600 for everything.  I have shot 23 rounds through it to date and if I wasn't trying to consolidate calibers for reloading, I would just keep it.  It would make an excellent deer, elk, moose, brontosaurus, or elephant hunting rifle.  The rifling is brand new, the bolt functions very smoothly, and the crown is brand new as you can see in the picture.  The scope comes with caliber specific turrets for .270, .300 win mag, and 30.06.  it also comes with a  standard 1/4 moa dial which works perfectly with the 7mm rem mag.
Trigger pull is nice and crisp and measures between 2 and 3 pounds.  I don't have a guage but id easily put it in that range and you can feel for yourself.  It has the Hogue rubberized stock on it, free floating 24 inch barrel, and a nice butt pad.  Whoever gets it Im sure will be exteemely happy.

Only real reason for getting rid of it is the E2 grip size is pretty small and my hands are very large. Felt pretty good at first, but once I shot a box through it, the size of it really showed. The E2 grips are great, just a little to small for me. Only looking to trade right now."
