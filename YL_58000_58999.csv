This is a Kel-Tec P32 in .32acp.  It has a Crimson Trace trigger-guard and an extended 10 round magazine.  It also has the Clip-Draw clip for easy concealment.  I've never had a malfunction with this pistol.  Accurate enough for its intended purpose.  Let me know what you've got if you're interested.  Thanks,

This is an Iver Johnson TP22, designed to look like a Walther PPK.  The caliber is .22lr, and the safety is only a safety, and not a de-cocker like on the PPK.  Most small semi-auto .22's do better with hotter ammunition, such as CCI Stingers, but this one doesn't.  This pistol likes the cheaper bulk rounds better than the hot rounds.  One magazine.  Let me know what you've got if you're interested.  Thanks,

This is a Webley MK IV revolver.  Let me be up-front, the cylinder has been shaved to accept .45acp.  Shooting original .455 Webley is possible by placing rings around each cartridge.  A lot of fun to shoot.  No import marks.  Proof marks on each chamber and the frame. Everything about this pistol is great, and it will take something special for me to part with it, but I'm open to ideas.  CAUTION:  This pistol is in excellent condition, and should only be used with mild lead nosed reloads.  .45acp loads exceed the pressure that the cylinder can handle.  Not only would you be out a great shooter, but a wonderful piece of history as well.  Let me know what you've got if you're interested.  Thanks,

This is a 1940 Nagant revolver in 7.62x38R.  This is an interesting piece of history.  Seven shots instead of six.  This has a horribly heavy trigger pull in double action, but single action is okay.  This pistol can also chamber .32 S&W, and with the .32acp cylinder included, can also chamber .32acp, which is easier to find than 7.62x38R.  Has original flap holster with ammunition pouches and cleaning rod.  Let me know what you've got if you're interested.  Thanks,

Spyderco Manix 2 Folding Knife S90V Blade Carbon Fiber Handles
Spyderco Knives has done it again. If you liked the Spyderco Manix and the Spyderco Manix2 folding pocketknives, this new Spyderco Manix 2 with Carbon Fiber handles will knock your socks off. The blade steel is S90V - a rare and high quality stainless steel in the commercial knife industry, and the handle is textured G10. These are beautiful. The Spyderco Manix is a great design and the engineering is first rate. They are entirely built in Colorado. See all Spyderco Knives at www.knifecenter.com
Here is the Spyderco Info:
Spyderco Knives is releasing a Sprint Run of 400 production pieces, of the C101 Manix2 folding knife with a carbon fiber handle and CPM-S90V steel blade. The Ball Bearing Lock is a patented Spyderco innovation. It’s a hardened free-floating ball bearing contained in a custom hi-tech polymer cage. The round ball bearing allows the lock to self adjust across a large surface, smoothly and consistently locking-up with solid confidence. The Ball Bearing Lock’s strength withstands hard work with a secure, versatile and comfortable grip. Ergonomics are peerless in this design. Handle is peel-ply carbon fiber manufactured by permeating fibers of carbon with epoxy resin. The result is a durable, slip free handle material that’s lightweight and textured with a fabric-like nap. The blade is CMP-S90V and full flat-ground with aggressive thumb serrations (jimping) above a super sized 14mm Spyderco Round Hole. The Jimping doesn’t stop there. With full steel liners the scales have jimping that extends beyond the carbon fiber handle scales scalloping areas of the handle’s perimeter. This one is not slipping out of your hand. The liners pull double purpose by adding rigidly and lightweight strength to the handle. A three-screw clip is left/right-hand carry, positioned for comfort and deep pocket carry. Oversized piped lanyard hole.

This is the tried and tested semi auto. I have had this rifle for a while and it shoots great. The guy I got it from didnt use it a whole lot. It has some small scratches and dings here and there in the stock. But it has been used to hunt. What can you expect ? The bluing is pretty decent. Action is good and tight. The scope is a Tasco. I have used Tasco for many years and they work just fine. Nice and clear and anti fog. I just had it out last week end tested out the scope for this year and it is ready for deer. Sighted at 1 inch high at 100 yards so you are on the money at 200 yards. These 742's are hard to find in 308. Specially this kind of price.

This is an Ohio State Highway Patrol issue pistol. The frame is stamped with the OSP logo and a serial number. This pistol is a double action only and comes with 2-10 round mags. No box or papers. It is in great shape. This gun shows very little carry wear. I believe it was an armory gun only issued as a backup until primary gun was fixed. It looks like it has sat on the shelf most of its life. I would like to trade towards a Remington 700 sps tactical in .308. Other offers considered will be for smaller carry pistols such as a Kahr P380 or a Walther PPK. Let me know what you got.

I bought it intending to use it for target shooting only at my favorite outdoor shooting spot, but since they converted the old woods into soccer fields...well, you get the idea.

It has seen less than 150 rounds through it, all of which worked very well. The Accu-Trigger makes this a very nice shooting rifle. In addition to the standard 5 round magazine, I also have 2-10 round mags, a breach lock, 3-9x40 scope, soft sided case & lots of ammo as part of the sale. I prefer to keep things local (twin cities metro area MN) but I'm willing to do a little traveling if the price is right. 

 The gun new is around $300, the scope & rings about $50, the case was $15, the ammo & mags about $30, so I'm open to (reasonable) offers, cash sale only. You can check my feedback rating on E-Bay, user name cravnsn. $275 OBO.

He posted one ad for it for $525 and got no bites because that is way over priced and now he reposted it as ""make offer"" yet he still wants $525 for it. He won't even let you see it in person to look over the gun and do a function check before you make an offer. He is a very unreasonable person to deal with!

Nice car with no hail damage.  THE FLAWS:  I have yet to find any dents in the car other then in the aluminum trim has a few.  Interior is good but not perfect, No rips in interior, dash is cracked but has a dash mat.  Has a couple of very small rust spots were it shows through the paint.  It also has a studder in the carburetor when you hit the gas but then runs fine so the carb needs some tuning.  Fuel gage works after dropping to half a tank. Also has a CD player but the installation piece is missing so its sitting in the dash.  Speedometer cable is broke but has a brand new one that comes with it.  But does come with a GPS that tells you MPH.  THE FACTS.  The motor is a mild 355 sbc.  TH 350 transmission with a shift kit.  Motor and tranny have approximately 6000 miles on them. New exhaust, Headman full length headers & Cherry bomb mufflers, 650 Holley carb, B&M ratchet shifter, Auto Gauge Tach, Water, and oil pressure gauges. Old Camaro Ralley wheels and BFG tires with 70+ percent on them.  I just traded for this car and it is a nice car but i just don't have the room for another car.  I will try to get some of the minor stuff fixed if i get time but it is still road worthy and runs great going down the highway.  Has plenty of power.  Does not smoke and is a dependable car.  Stock gears in the rear.  Email me for more pics and info.  I have owned the car for 3 days. Car has 41000 original miles on it and the speedo cable broke not to long ago from what i was told.
