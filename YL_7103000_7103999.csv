Pic 2 & 3 are the 90% one, notice the scratch in the last picture. People typically love (or hate) the RTF2 frame. Glock every now and then will do a special run of the frames but not the slides.

This gun is light and lightning fast to the shoulder, as it weights in at around 6 lbs. You can carry this gun all day without fatigue. It's about as perfect a quail, dove, grouse, and woodcock gun as you could ask for and they're getting more difficult to find especially in this condition. There are no gouges in the stock finish, but a few dings. The bluing shows minor wear from carry; but, overall I would rate this gun in 92-93% overall condition.Because of the cult following of this gun, it's condition, and it's scarcity, the price is set at $1,350.As of right now, local pick-up only; but, willing to drive a resonable distance for a serious buyer.

I have 49 rounds of Jacketed hollow points, 38 are 90 grain Fiocchi, the other 11 are Federal defensive jhp at 85-90gr I believe. For the full metal jackets, I have 38 rounds of Fiocchi fmj at 95 gr and 9 rounds of PPU (PrizPartizan) at 94 gr, all factory loads as I said. I am looking to trade for .38 Special, 9mm, 7.62x54R, .22lr, or 12g slugs or buckshot. I would prefer to trade for .38 spl or 9mm, and jhp would be ideal but anything is fine. I would trade my whole lot for 1 box of Buffalo Bore in .38 spl/9mm. This was around $40 of ammo new in store, so looking to trade for the equivalent value, or adjust on your end or mine with cash.

This is a brand new custom built AR15 in the 450 Bushmaster caliber. Weight is a very light 6lbs. 11oz. The 7075-T6 billet aluminum upper was mfg. by Sota Arms and made specifically for large caliber AR-15s like the Bushmaster 450 cartridge. The upper features a factory oversized ejection port, factory installed dust cover, and forward assist. The lower is an Aero Precision 7075-T6 aluminum forging marked Multi Caliber. The lower contains a tensioning screw that can be used to remove all clearance between the upper and lower creating a wobble free assembly. The rifle stock, trigger guard, and grip are Magpul MOE in flat dark earth. The Magpul MOE stock and grip both have storage compartments. The lower parts kit is Milspec. The aluminum free float hand guard is a 12” long key mod rail system in flat dark earth. The top of the rail is full length picatinny with 2 additional 3” long FDE key mod rails that can be attached anywhere along the sides or bottom of the hand guard. The overall width of the handguard is 1.6” not including rails. The ported barrel is manufactured by custom barrel manufacturer Deadshot Barrels. This 16” barrel is of the heavy contour style and is manufactured from 4140 Chrome Moly steel with a non-reflective armor black Cerakote coating. The barrel is ported and therefore does not require a flash hider or muzzle brake. The ports act as a muzzle brake which keeps the recoil down and since it is integrated into the barrel the overall length is kept to a minimum. The barrel features a center feed ramp for proper feeding of the Bushmaster 450 cartridge. The barrel is manufactured for a carbine length gas system with a .875” diameter gas block seat. The underside of the barrel is dimpled for proper gas block alignment. Rifle comes with one stainless steel 5 shot magazine. Awesome looking and handling rifle. Nothing to do but mount some optics and start shooting. Rifle has been function fired to ensure proper function.

This is a MOA/MOA optic. This model is hard to find innitially,and to find one NIB is a Super Rare Find. It has never been out of the Factory Box. The box was Factory Sealed and I just recently opened it up to inspect it and make sure it was actually in there.... It was, and it is Awesome... The NPR1 is the Very Best Reticle that NightForce made. I can't believe they replaced it with the MOAR Reticle. Only $1799.00This is a $2000 dollar Precision Optic so my price is FIRM......Many consider the Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 to be the ultimate long range scope. It’s 56mm objective lens provides maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range. This advanced field tactical scope has a wide magnification factor that allows precision accuracy at the longest ranges yet is highly effective for shots at close ranges. The design of this scope exudes ruggedness and that is exactly what it is. With 100 MOA of elevation travel and 20 MOA or 10 mils of travel per turret revolution respectively per turret version, no target will be out of range of this scope. Optional Nighhtforce Zero Stop elevation turret and standard illuminated reticle compliment the side parallax adjustment rounding out the most popular rifle scope Nightforce has yet produced. So whether you are a long range hunter or a tactical shooter, this rifle scope will be all that you will ever need."

An ACOG sight would be great as well (used is ok, so long as it works properly), and a ventilated hand guard with rails allowing the barrel to free-float would be perfect to finish it off.

The SAINT’s flat top design is optics ready and includes a flip-up rear aperture sight and fixed A2-style front. The 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel features a 1:8 twist rate to handle a wide range of bullet types. The operation of the M16 bolt carrier group is managed by a mid-length gas system paired with a heavy tungsten buffer, resulting in an exceptionally smooth action. A good shot starts with the trigger, so that’s why the SAINT™ AR15 features micro-polished and Nickel Boron treated components. While it offers the right pull weight for defensive use, you won’t feel it.
Unlike most defensive rifles in its price range, the SAINT™ AR15 includes top notch furniture designed to improve both shooting experience and operator performance. An all new, exclusive Bravo Company PKMT KeyMod handguard packs heat shields and flexible attachment points into a slim and easy to handle form factor. The Bravo Company buttstock is rattle-free and complemented by a Bravo pistol grip designed to improve defensive performance.
Built for the free and independent, Springfield Armory®’s SAINT™ AR15 represents the next generation of America’s personal defense rifle. Built with relentless dedication to reliability, it’ll be ready when you are because you can always trust the SAINT™ AR15."

This pistol is used, it comes with one mag, a hard case and is 24k gold plated with a Tiger stripe pattern. The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters. When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time."
