Has the standard slimline handguard and fixed stock, both OD green color, and a picatinny rail that's attached to receiver at the factory. The barrel is, in fact, a proper free floated design where the handguard anchors to the charging handle tube, so it's capable of extremely consistent groups with the right ammo and the right shooter. This thing's a phenomenal rifle, and will eat up whatever you wanna feed it. I've shot Tula, surplus NATO ball ammo, Wolf, Perfecta, and it's never jammed and never failed to extract once. I'm simply selling it because sometimes a battle rifle isn't the most practical thing to have money invested in. Asking $800 firm, includes (I believe) six mags and a hard case. Text at four oh two, fore too nine, six 1 four won, or email me. I'll wanna see your photo ID and purchase permit when we make the sale. Please have cash on hand, I'm not looking for trades or barters."

I would consider multi gun trades for the 1911 but the value would have to add up to 900.00. I can also add cash to some trades. I like ARs and AKs, ksg, iwi uzi, colt and kimber pistols, tommy guns,  Desert eagle, old West pistols and rifles, ww2 samurai swords,  and all kinds of other guns so don't be afraid to make any offers. The worst I'll say is no but thank you for offering. Face to face sale only.  I will not ship the gun.  MUST BE 21 TO BUY THIS GUN!!! MUST BE LEGAL TO OWN A GUN!!! MUST BE WILLING TO SIGN A BILL OF SALE AND SHOW YOUR DL OR CHL!!! Email me or text me @ 903-570-7481. Im located close to Forney .Thanks for looking at my add and God Bless..."

The worst I'll say is no but thank you for offering. Face to face sale only.  I will not ship the gun.  MUST BE 21 TO BUY THIS GUN!!! MUST BE LEGAL TO OWN A GUN!!! MUST BE WILLING TO SIGN A BILL OF SALE AND SHOW YOUR DL OR CHL!!! Email me or text me @ REDACTED. Im located close to Forney .Thanks for looking at my add and God Bless..."

The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719. New for 2016 are Flat Dark Earth (FDE) models, VPs with special colorants added to the frame during the molding process creating the tan/brown color scheme increasing used by military and security units. The frame’s color is indestructible, permanent and completely resistant to fading or chemical change."

Ready for anything. Kimber Tactical pistols have the performance-enhancing features demanded by law enforcement professionals. Available in a range of configurations, they cover everything from tactical response to concealed carry.
Meprolight night sights are standard. Front strap and trigger guard checkering are standard. Extended ambidextrous thumb safety are standard. Kimber Tactical pistols are no-compromise, purpose-built pistols that leave nothing out, and Kimber quality brings it all together in five different platforms. Three full-size versions exceed all traditional and tactical law enforcement requirements. Compact models cover everything else. Like all Kimber pistols, each has rounded and blended edges to prevent snagging, along with match grade barrels, chambers and triggers. No other pistol design equals the 1911 for true tactical performance.

This started out as a pistol. From there we added an AMD barrel extension and AMD extended Fishbone muzzle break. These were threaded onto the stock barrel then pinned at the bottom to bring the barrel length to just over 16"" to comply with BATFE regulations. Next we added a Stormwerkz folding stock adaptor which is attached with two bolts (and can be removed if you wish to convert this back to a pistol). This locks up tight in both positions, no wiggle in it at all!Then came the ACE 8.5"" Skeleton Stock with a 1"" rubber shoulder pad. We cut the front sight rings and converted it to a moon shape (like other AK's) and left it so it can still be adjusted. We cut the rear sight off, smoothed it down and then fully welded a Midwest Industries 2-in-1 rear sight and an Aimpoint/Sparc specific mount. We added a Sparc II onto that which is at the perfect distance from your eye when aiming down the sights. Since it was welded it holds zero once sighted in at your desired range and you can co-witness with it as well. As a backup there are iron sights integrated into the mount that can be used by simply looking through the optic as well. We chose this because it's not resting on any moving parts (i.e. The front rail or rear dust cover) which typically move around and won't hold zero like our mount.Next we added matching Magpul furniture. The front is a modular fore end which has a hundred different attachment options from Magpul's line. Finally we finished it off with a base of Burnt Bronze Cerakote then a thin layer of Graphite Black which was distressed to give it that beautiful (and tactical) war torn look. The gun will also come with an ACE rifle bag, 3-30rd waffle mags, 5-20rd waffle mags and 1,000rds of Wolf 7.62x39 ammo.$1600 for everything or $1400 without the ammo.Please email Nathan@ShueBox.net with any questions or you can call/text to 352-238-6388.Shipping will be a flat $40 (gun and ammo ship separately) or it can be picked up in Tampa, FL.We do accept CC for a 3% fee otherwise money orders or cash (if picking up) is preferred.Gun will need to be shipped to your FFL and can only be shipped to states that allow.
