Incidentally, the backstrap of the XD-S is interchangeable (one size comes mounted on the gun with the other size in the case). The limited real estate of the pistol lends to categorizing it as a sub compact pistol. As anticipated of most pistols of this class, the grip is less than full size. When grasped, this reviewer’s pinky extends somewhat over the bottom edge of the grip. So, anyone with burly man hands will likely want to consider picking up the extended mags that Springfield will offer for this pistol. In addition to extending the grip size by about an inch, it also increases the XD-S 9’s capacity to 9+1 (beyond its standard 7+1 rounds of 9×19). As with Springfield’s other pistols in the XD line, the XD-S 9 features a grip safety that must be depressed in order to depress the trigger and fire the gun.In addition to the features covered above, the Springfield XD-S 9 also has an ambidextrous magazine release (it is both functional from the left and right sides of the firearm without alteration). For those who shoot with a finger extended on the outer edge of the trigger guard, the outside edge of the front of the trigger guard is checkered.Payment Method   checks, bitcoin, bank transfer"

These Progressive Presses are built like a tank and made to last. The press has been restored and is very clean and in like new condition. This press is set up to run .45 acp currently. It can be swapped over to load other calibers, but they require some add on parts. I have piles of replacement parts included as well as a whole collection of powder bushings to ensure this press is set for a long time. Some parts can be still purchased through the original manufacturer even though they no longer make them. A case feeder hopper has been installed and makes large loading sessions very easy and very affordable. This press is currently set up to run right away with a good set of RCBS Carbide dies and the powder bushing to drop standard 45 acp loads. It comes with 4 primer tubes and easy base mount I made. A Dillon Press rocks, but these also work phonominally wel. Unlike a Dillon, these are made to last far longer with their nearly all metal construction. I have a Dillon set up to load multiple calibers, but I no longer have space to have this press running as well. Compared to the most economical equivallents out there right now, this press has a whole lot of extra features at the same or less price point. I have loaded a large amount of .45 on this press, and hate to let it go.The Press has a little dust on it, so it looks a little dirtier than it is. I also have many more pictures available and can help the buyer set it up. I may be listing this on ebay soon as well to try and sell it."

I have looked everywhere and can not see a stamp on the barrel.  It is 18 3/8"".  Also includes 176 rounds of ammo. 16 loaded en bloc clips and 48 loose rounds. I'll throw in the ammo can. Headstamp is F N 58. I picked this up from a local FFL I know about 15 years ago. I haven't gotten around to shooting it so it might as well go.  I know you all want to hear who did the conversion so I will tell you I have no idea. I realize that will be a sticking point for a lot of people but it is what it is. In my experience folks either like and want a tanker or hate them with a passion. No real middle ground. Cash only, no trades.  Will consider reasonable offers. I am in Champaign and due to circumstances and work can't drive very far to meet. It would have to be in the evening if we do. All laws and regulations will be followed. At least a 24 hour wait from when I run your foid through the ISP website. I will not ship.

The trigger pull is very short but positive and crisp, not mushy, and has a very short reset.)Warren Tactical Sevigny competition series sights with fiber optic front and serrated rearLWD stainless steel takedown pinsExtended slide stop leverExtended magazine releaseFrame work: finger grooves removed (no stippling under the A-grip wrap-I prefer the wrap), double undercut, stippled, and flared trigger guard, relieft cut around magazine release, very slight palm swell reduction (this serves more to make the grip feel more vertical without reducing the size of the grip-I have large hands and it fits great), wedge cut stippling on the index points, custom mixed storm grey duracoat, A-grip synthetic suede grip wrap (most people don't know what this is, but I love it and have it on all my guns. It is soft but very high traction. It works great when wet or dry, doesn't grab on clothing and feels soft when carried concealed. It also lasts literally years, but I just replaced it.)I obviously have a lot of time and money into this gun. It is a formidable competition/race setup, but it's not finicky or unreliable. It still feeds any ammo, has all stock functionality, and it's a fun pistol to shoot. It's had plenty pf rounds through it, but was always maintained well and is 100% reliabe. There a few minor cosmetic issues: Ships/scuffs in the duracoat on the bottom of the trigger guard-this happened while the coating was fresh and still soft. There is also a blemish in the coating on the left side of the slide-it's slightly discolored in a spot. Please contact me with any questions."

It was then fitted in a Boyd's Featherweight Thumb Hole stock in pepper wood color, barrel free floated, and action glass bedded. A limbsaver recoil bad was added, as was a scope rail, and a Timney single stage trigger currently set at 2.5 lbs. I recently had a skeletonized bolt handle put on as well that is not pictured. The rifle does NOT come with the scope pictured. The rifle has been cleaned meticulously and has had approx. 800 rounds through it...and it shoots great groups. I have Berger 175 VLD's sitting 20 thou's off the land's shooting .2"" groups easily. Any questions feel free to ask.

I purchased this pistol a number of years ago from a family member who purchased it new, but then fell upon some hard times so I bought it and have had it ever since. I've truly enjoyed shooting this pistol and it is without a doubt the most accurate handgun I've ever shot. Back when I was younger and my eyes were better I could set up a bunch of NECCO WAFERS at 25 yards and hit them all day long without fail using the factory iron sights on this pistol. This thing shoots well with any 22LR ammo but it really comes to life using some of the higher end German ammo by RWS and I would basically have one ragged hole at 25 yards if I did my part. Truth is that my shooting abilities probably didn't extract every bit of accuracy this thing was capable of. Now I'm starting to get old and my eyes aren't what they used to be. So I'm reluctantly putting this out there to see if I can find it a new owner who will appreciate it's capabilities. I'm not inclined to reduce my price because I'm asking nothing more than what these things go for. They aren't all that easy to find and not all that many were made. So there is no need to offer any less. This pistol has been used but very well cared for. I would rate it's physical condition as excellent and it's perfect mechanically. The trigger pull is superb as well. Price is $600 picked up In the Brandon area by a Florida resident who is at least 21 years old. A proper bill of sale will be provided. I am not set up to ship firearms and will not even consider doing it. So please don't ask as the answer is NO SHIPPING. I will not even respond to requests to to ship or to the scam money order deal going around here on Armslist. This pistol will be sold Face to Face for $600 in American Cash Money and absolutely nothing else. Thanks for looking"
