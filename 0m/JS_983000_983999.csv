The smaller calibers came after 1884.  the 32-20 was introduced in late 1884.  It could not have been converted over to 32-20 unless barrell and cylinder was replaced, which would not have been cost effective.  Also the United States Military did not have that caliber in service at that time. the smallest caliber pistol round for the US military during that time frame was the 38 long colt, introduced to the military in 1892. in centerfire before that, it was the 45 long colt. So the only way this can have been issued to the military at that time was in 45 colt, so as you say it would be a conversion, which is highly doubtful to do a conversion to such a small caliber.  That is normally purpose built.  Who ever did the bluing job on this particular firearm destroyed what value it might have had.  This firearm in working condition is worth 200-300 range being generous.  Thank you"

I finally just gave up and put my .22 conversion upper on one of them.  The other I guess I'll just sell as it isn't doing me any good with overpriced uppers and no bcg's available.
This lower is made by New Frontier Arms.  It's listed as Multi-Caliber so you can mount whatever you'd like on it (5.56 .223 6.8 .22 etc)  It weighs 1.6 pounds, 7.2oz's lighter than a typical aluminum lower.  It's easy to clean and more scratch resistant than aluminum.  You can use MilSpec or Commercial parts with it.  Has a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer against defects in craftsmanship.  It has the accu-group composite fire control system installed, but can accommodate your own LPK as well.  The stock is the 6 position adjustable unit.  A lot of people talk down on the polymer AR lowers, but just by looking at how well Glock has done with polymer in their firearms, I think we can all see that these puppies are tough.  I've used my DPMS 5.56 upper on mine and it functions flawlessly.  The first picture shows the lower with a .22LR mag in it.  That mag is not included.  The second shows the lower with a S&W MP15-22 Upper on it.  The upper is also NOT included.  Those two pictures are just to show the flexability of the lower.  FTF meet to sale at my local range, I will need to see a valid GA drivers license.  Prefer to see a CWL as well. $400 Firm

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvLt8-Wf7r0
if for any reason you're concerned about how hard it might be to install I'll do it for you when we meet.  just bring your rifle with a collapsible stock.

I bought it and put it on my AR.  I ran several clips through my rifle and had a blast but a) my gun is mainly home defense  so full auto isn't exactly required and b) my wife wants me to unload some gun stuff to raise a little cash.  So I took it right back off my rifle and put it back in the bubble wrap and in the box.

It is in brand new condition with all the bits and pieces in the box including both parts in the original bubble wrap, paper work, and the allen wrench it came with.

$375for the stock and like I said, I'll install it for your on a collapsible stock rifle if you want me too.  No shipping costs, no waiting on backorders.  This stock is listed in the new ""assault weapons ban"" bill.  Once that thing passes they won't be able to make these anymore."

I took this in on trade and was told by a gun dealer that it's worth about $500 in it's current condition.  It would be worth more but the previous owner had the wood refinished which hurt the value.  It's not the model 99E which is worth less.  The EG are the earlier builds apparently.  The shop said that the barrel looked like it was in good shape but the gun could use oil.  It hasn't been shot in 10 plus years.  The guy I traded with said the plate, with his fathers initials, on it is solid gold (I haven't had that checked) and the round counter is made of true brass.  As I said before....I'm not a gun guy so if any of this is incorrect or makes me look like an idiot please go easy on me!  I want the gun gone soon!!  Call or text me anytime at 810-210-0500.

As always, local customers have first choice. We have 4 in stock. 

Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun --Â just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty. Â The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular in the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy-framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted in some available space that was used to increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds.Â The results speak for themselves --Â the flush-fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W.

The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change.Â

If you purchase more than 1 and I will combine shipping and Buyer would then pay actual shipping. This 5.56x45mm M196 tracer ammo loaded 20 rounds per carton and is a special buy from a military contract overrun from the famed Lake City plant. It is perfect for shooting with your 5.56x45mm chambered AR-15! Tracer ammo is a great training tool for shooting in low light situations. Many serious shooters find that shooting with tracer ammo is a fun experience and a great training tool. You can actually watch the bullet's flight path through the air with your naked eye! M196 55 gr tracer ammo is actually preferred by many civilian shooters over the more commonly found M856 64 gr tracer load. The reason for this preference is that this projectile will stabilize in a broader range of barrels from 1:9 to 1:12 while the M856 projectile is properly stabilized with only a quick twisting 1:7 twist rate which is less common. If you're unsure, just check your AR-15's barrel and the twist rate will be displayed. If you see a 1:9 or 1:12, then you're good to go! Whether you're looking to do some serious low light training and target practice, or just some fun watching the flight of the bullet, Lake City's M196 5.56x45mm ammo is a great option! Each round is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, and reloadable. It is both economical and precision manufactured in the United States by an established U.S. cartridge producer. Shipping is 9.00 Ground.* Payment: I will accept Money order, cashiers check, and discreet PayPal. If paying with PayPal add 3%. Try some without the BIG investment of buying hundreds of rounds.

They made rifles hoping for military sales, as well as semi auto only rifles and a pistol. Apparently only 700 of these pistols ever were imported into the US. They are a some what copy of the AR-180 design. A square tube steel receiver with minor changes to the bolt. The triangular bolt head lives on in the Barret 50 cal rifles. Uses a HK style cocking handle. Threaded 10"" barrel. Piston gas system. 

Uses regular AR-15 mags, tho does not seem to like the Pmags for whatever reason. Old style metal USGI mags work fine. I did replace the extractor as it had a crack where the pin went thru, of course being out of business you cannot buy the original part, but an AR-15 one drops in with no issues. Took it as part of a trade, its interesting but bought a rifle and something needs to go to help pay for it. 

I have an aimpoint on a Burris QD PEPR mounted to the top, it did come with a sort of mounting rail, no slots like weaver, but somebody was thinking ahead. For the price unlikely I will part with the aimpoint to. Maybe the mount since I had to mod the mount to work right. If one was inclined it would be a really interesting weapon to do the paperwork and make into a SBR."

This gun has quite a bit of character rubbed into it but still has strong rifling and a very good replacement W.R.A. (Winchester Repeating Arms) trigger group.  It was possibly rebarreled, but I can't find date stamp on barrel anywhere.

I have a Springfield XD 40 subcompact that is my carry piece and I would like another of the flush fitting 9 round magazines for it.
I know they are getting hard to find and expensive when you do, but I have no intention of taking advantage of people's fears right now, so I'd be perfectly happy to do a straight across trade of one of my full size 12 round mags for one of the flush fitting 9 round mags for my subcompact.

However, let me make this VERY clear, I WILL NOT SELL and I will ONLY TRADE for this specific mag I'm looking for, so don't offer me any 10 round mags, or glock, ak, ar, or any other mags, or anything else for that matter.  I don't have to get rid of it by any means so I'll just hold onto it if no one has what I'm looking for.  Please do not waste either of our time if you dont have the subcompact 9 round mags.

I technically have two of these 12 round mags, but I plan on keeping one unless you would be willing to trade three of the 9 round mags for the two 12 round ones.  And this would also be my only condition that I would pass with both.

SR9C that operates flawlessly with approximately 700 rounds through it.  I have two 9's and wanting to tinker with another caliber.  Everything in the package cost me close right at $600+ cash value not retail value and am looking for a lightly used trade in the same cash value (not retail value.)  I know what guns are selling for.  
What you get
-SR9C 
-Two 17 round magazines
-Two 10 round magazines  (2nd Magazine is in the gun in picture)
((That is one extra of each magazine which cost me just under $100.  Price the magazines.   I carried with the 10 in the gun and the 17 at the side.  Easier to conceal.  The extra gives you a 10 and a 17 to practice with at the range.))
-A desantis holster
-A second leather holster
-Traction Grips installed.  Can be easily removed.  
-Two of the magazines filled with 28 rounds of Speer Gold Dot 124 grain +P Ammo plus one for chamber.

Will only trade with a person who is the original owner of a gun and has a receipt, also has a ccw to prove they have the right to own a gun in the state of ohio.  
Gun has been totally cared for and cleaned after each range trip.  Broken in beautifully and 100 percent reliable. 

Will sell with one of each magazine filled with speer gold dots, grips. and with one holster for $425 or with both hosters and all four magazines for $500.  Trust me, you would want to pay the extra for the magazines.  The 17 rounder if you can find it is going for insane prices now and the 10's are super hard to find.  My package has all you need and the extras.  All for 100 dollars less than my cost.  This gun was purchased by me 9/14/2012 New.

Reason for selling/trading, I just bought another 9 that is a little more compact.  Do I feel my new 9 is anymore reliable, no it is just even more compact and that is what I wanted right now along with reliability.  This gives me the option to trade or sell this and get something else in another caliber to tinker with.  I honestly love this gun and in no way need to sell it or am pressed to sell it.  I feel I am being fair with my price and package in that the price I got the gun I am not inflating to you and being honest on what I paid and taking $100 off.  Look at the prices on this site and you will see what I mean.  Most people what what they paid and more for everything right now.  I am willing to take the hit to get a new toy.  

Last if you offer me a trade, again go to slickguns.com and look at what the price of your gun is selling for or was selling for before you try saying it is worth 100 or 200 more.  Thank you for looking"

The gun is currently zeroed at 75 yards for M855 at 40 Degrees Farenheit. This rifle will shoot 1/2"" groups at 100 yards with Winchester M855. I have always kept the gun meticulously clean inside and out. I have always lubed it with Royal Purple gear oil, after many years I have learned that it works extremely well.
