Following up on the pistol after purchasing it, I came to know that the gun was one of the 5,000 or so that was created for a South African Police force by special order, this order was then canceled after the pistols were assembled per spec in their German factory. 

The difference lies within the slide safety as well as the short tac trigger being preinstalled. The trigger is available from Sig Sauer aftermarket for Pro series pistols, but this one was fitted at the factory, as well as the slide safety (a bonus if you're a safety nut like me). 

There are exactly 13 mags down the pipe of this pistol, which equates to 130rds through it. The pistol has not been holstered, was cleaned and lubed accordingly prior to shooting, and has was cleaned within hours of shooting last weekend. 

Considering the pistol is not fully broken in, the groupings and feel of the firearm are quite impressive out of the box. I'd have NO problem keeping this, but more expenses have arisen for me and my wedding come May, so, my toys go first, unfortunately.

This is an Early production Arsenal of Bulgaria Milled receiver SA M-7 AK47 in 7.62x39. 
Bought by me 11 years ago. Rifle has approximately 2000 rounds down the pipe. Barrel is A+ as all rifling is strong,sharp and lands are still sharp. This rifle has the chromed bore option. The rifle was bought in 2001 when i was in the military and had the pinned muzzle break. Ive never wanted to ""Bubba"" this rifle so i left the break alone. It can be removed and threaded should some one want to go that route. Rifle has usual safety lever line marks, gas tube lever line marks, and knicks around the magazine well from steel mags. Rifle has NO rust OR corrosion. Has been my baby as i paid top dollar for it 11 years ago when run of the mill AK's were 300-400 a piece. 
Rifle also has the scope side rail. Rail is absolutely straight as an arrow.
 With rifle also comes
1.) a PSO scope from Russia..not the new cheap ass imports in english. All controls are in russian. Has illuminated reticle for low light shooting. i also have the bag it came from Russia in - should oyu like it as a wall hanger as i have used it as. 
2.) 2 tapco magazines that functioned flawlessly and a 75 round spring loaded drum magazine. Drum has always worked flawless. 
For 100 bucks more ill throw in the Winchester metal double rifle case this gun has lived in since 2001.

The link above has pics uploaded to photobucket. I took alot and had to play with the camera to get them to come out right..im a nurse...not a photographer. If you need more or are seriously interested and wish to see in person I will show it to you in person if reasonably close.
I will ship it to your FFL on your dime through my local FFL.

There is nothing wrong with the function, but I decided that I do not like the aftermarket parts and I want to keep my rifle all original factory parts. These are brand new and only lightly used to test function, no more. One has a bit of extra wear on the outside section that goes into the rifle because it has been loaded into the rifle a few more times than the others. Two still have somewhat stiff springs from the factory and need to be broken in more, which can be accomplished by loading them and letting them sit for a week or two to break the spring in.
I'd rather not pay shipping to send them back, so I put them up here. Get em before they're gone. These are the most popular aftermarket magazines for the SKS, and they work well - much better than ProMag and the other no name brands. Next best thing to a Chinese 20 round 'star' magazine and a TON cheaper.
I am not willing to ship."

The new barrel inletted into stock, to better than factory tolerances. Look at the 100 yard target!! This is a serious rifle. In case you did not know, this is about the ONLY rifle I know of that is recent production, and that has a stainless STEEL trigger guard assembly, not plated aluminum. Otherwise the rifle is stock. NOTE: The scope does NOT come with the rifle, but the Ruger rings do. The two, two shot groups outside the orange circle were shot while sighting in. The group within the orange circle is a 5 shot group, with no waiting for cool down. I do not accept barrels that ""walk"" when heated. There are NO issues with this rifle, it's original caliber was .223 as well. The rifle has less than a box of ammo through it.  Please e-mail me with any questions.

Serial number is 1662X.  Manufacture date was in 1901-02.  It has a 26 inch barrel and the classic pot belly crescent butt stock.  It was refinished many moons ago and the buttstock was apparently replaced as well.  It does appear to be a pretty well done factory replacement.  The forearm is original.  The re-blue on the barrel wasn't done very well as you can see waves in the surface of the metal if you angle it just right.  The bore is dark but not pitted.  The rifling is very strong.  The internals of the rifle are fantastic.  Some parts look like they left the factory a lot less than 110 years ago.  The receiver hasn't been drilled and tapped for a scope.  The wood is sound with no visible cracks.  I have shot this rifle a little and it groups well at 50 yards.  Function is perfect.  Feel free to contact me with questions and we can discuss options.  The rear tang sight is no longer available.

Bought NEW last weekend after the long back order. Feels great, super easy to carry BUT  I'm a glock guy (edc is a gen4 glock 27, or 33) but decided to try out the springfield. Took it to the range yesterday put one box (50 rounds) through it. Accurate as hell, my muscle memory is set to glocks though, I don't have the time or ammo to retrain my hands. Especially when it comes to carry. Paid 699 plus tax, almost 760. I'm sure I got gouged but its expected when that's the only available one. Will sell for 600 no less. Comes with 2 mags, holster, box papers etc...all the factory xd stuff

 As fas as trades, I'm looking for a beretta storm cx4, the carbine. Prefer in 9mm. But if you have something interesting. I already have aks, ars and all the glocks I want. Maybe a mini 14/30 if it has the newer barrel. No hurry to sell or trade. But I'm sure people are as excited about this xds as I was

It has electric start and kick start, still good compression and not seized, also has an alarm system with remote.  It also comes with two helmets, one full face and one shorty.  Feel free to email me for more photos or with specific questions."

This is a highly collectable Ruger Security Six 2 3/4"" barrel 357 Magnum in Stainless Steel. This gun is in 99% condition, I say 99% as it is used but not much!!! No rust, scratches, or any other issues. It is flawless.

When I say highly collectable, first off it was made in 1975, this was the first year Ruger made this gun in Stainless Steel, also this is a PRE-WARNING revolver. In 1977 Ruger started put warning stamps on the barrel stating to read owners manuel etc... before using the gun. My gun has no warning, lastly it is the snub nose version made with a 2 3/4"" barrel, these are alot harder to come by as the production numbers on these length barrels were very limited. It has adjustable sights as well. Try and find a 2 3/4"" Pre warning in this condition, you wont, I searched two years before I found this one and it was a fluke, they are just not out there for sale???

I have a nice pair of Hogue Grips on the gun and I also have the original wooden grips, the original grips are mint condition. This gun has been fired very little and lockup is super tight and the trigger in single action is crisp, so crisp and light it is amazing. One of the best pistols I have ever owned and fired. Selling it to fund another project!

Lastly this gun comes with a handmade leather holster, this holster was special made for this gun and the two combine for a excellect carry piece.
This gun also comes with two speed loaders and some ammo.

Box and Papers:  Original boxes for each gun, extra barrel, and extra stocks are included.  Many original letters between the owner and Remington, including R.A. Williamson, F.T. Plunkett, Larry Delgrego.  Copies of the original order and other documents, some notarized. 

Description:   This set of F Grade Remingtons is like no other.  A total of four guns were made in 1966 with the 150 year anniversary engraving on the receiver.  One 870 was made for another customer and a second 1100 was made for the company president after this order was completed.  Both of these guns were commissioned in by the father of my client.  

The engraving performed by Bob Runge is exquisite in detail.  The entire receiver as well as each barrel are engraved.  The bolt on the 870 is not engraved as that was standard for this model, even in the TF grade.  This is explained in one of the letters.

The wood is like none I have seen on a factory gun.  The figure is beautiful and the high gloss finish brings out the depth of the grain.  Each stock has a gold name plate with the owner's name engraved.

Many letters are included telling the history of the order (see the last pictures for a sample of the letters.) All of the original boxes are present as is the shipping box.

Description:   This set of F Grade Remingtons is like no other.  A total of four guns were made in 1966 with the 150 year anniversary engraving on the receiver.  One 870 was made for another customer and a second 1100 was made for the company president after this order was completed.  Both of these guns were commissioned in by the father of my client.

The engraving performed by Bob Runge is exquisite in detail.  The entire receiver as well as each barrel are engraved.  The bolt on the 870 is not engraved as that was standard for this model, even in the TF grade.  This is explained in one of the letters.

The wood is like none I have seen on a factory gun.  The figure is beautiful and the high gloss finish brings out the depth of the grain.  Each stock has a gold name plate with the owner's name engraved. 

Many letters are included telling the history of the order (see the last pictures for a sample of the letters.) All of the original boxes are present as is the shipping box.

I'd like to pick up a nicer AK-47, preferably one with wood furniture. It'd be nice if it had ammo included. I'll spend somewhere between $400-$700, or have quite a few guns I might be willing to deal as a trade (with cash on either party's end to make it fair). Some potential trades include a new Remington VersaMax, beretta PX4 in .45, an old HK imported Benelli Super Black Eagle, etc.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

It had new ball joints, new tie rod ends, new track bar, new full size spare tire, flowmaster exhaust, and a trailer hitch. Until recently, it has been a reliable daily driver. Now it's hard to start. The fuel pressure bleeds down over night, and immediately after starting, the pressure falls off and dies right away. After a few tries, it will stay running just fine until you shut it off next. I assume it needs a fuel pump. If you are able to throw a bit of money at it, i have no doubt that it will continue to be a reliable jeep. I don't use it much as I have a sedan that suits my needs well, and am not interested in putting much into it. Just want it gone, and hopefully fixed up right by its new owner.
