This is the most accurate rifle I own. It is all camoflauged(dipped) from the factory in Mossy Oak Brush. It has a medium heavy contour barrel on it.It has the Accutrigger and it adjust down to 1 and 1/2 to 2 pounds or as high as 5 pounds. I believe that is what the range is. New these guns run $ 700 or more.  I have shot 3 shot groups pushing 1/4 of an inch with this gun. It is amazing how well this gun shoots. I am asking $550.00 OBO . Wether or not you buy into the barrel break in philosophy.This gun had a proper barrel break in.
 I will include scope and mounts but then the price goes to $700. The scope is a Burris Fullfield 2. 3-9-40.

 There is a small area on the side of the gun that the camo came off.It is still tan underneath and does not affect the gun in anyway. These guns  are selling for over $700 dollars at 2 of the bigger name internet places. Plus then you have to throw on transfer fees to an FFL and taxes/shipping and your over 750.

Thanks for looking. I would be willing to trade for Glock, Springfield XD OR XDM.I would also be interested in a complete AR Upper. An AR upper would be my first choice.

This gun has an adjustable trigger similar to a savage accutrigger. It is blued and has a synthetic stock on it.  I have shot it maybe 35 times. I originally bought it as a dual purpose  mule deer/antelope gun for Wyoming. The 25-06 is a fast flat shooting caliber.

 The stock was touching the barrel when I got it. I sanded/dremeled down the stock so it did not touch anywhere on the barrel. This isn't a great look but it shoots better:) There was quite a bit of material taken off around the barrel by me.Thats why the gun is so reasonably priced

I have shot the gun and it is in no way affected by this.You can get a Boyds laminated grey/black stock for it for about 90 dollars or you can get a light brown/dark brown laminated stock for it. They make the gun very sharp looking.

This gun was originally marketed as the Savage Edge and then it was changed to the Axis. These gun sell for $300 new. I wanted a 22-250 for coyote hunting and did not want to spend a lot of money. Once again Savage did not disappoint when it came to accuracy. This gun shoots under an inch at 100 yards.The only complaint I had was that it did not have the Accutrigger. The stock trigger was horrible. I spent 85 dollars and put a Rifle Basix Trigger in it. These are well made aftermarket triggers. This gun is now a real pleasure to shoot as the trigger pull is a crisp and clean 3 pounds. I will sell the gun which includes the scope base for 325.00 OBO.Wether or not you buy into the barrel break in philosophy or not.This gun had a proper barrel break in. I painted the stock for winter hunting.It is tastefully done and the stock was removed for the painting. The scope is not included in the price.It comes with the solid weaver rail bough separately to mount the scope on.

Has a Blue illuminated tactical scope and tactical light. Approx. 300 rounds through it. Awesome pistol, shoots great, I just don't use it much and so it's time for someone else to have some fun.
Breakdown of cost:
PLR-22- 329.99
Compact forend- purchased directly from Kel-Tec 50.00
Scope-129.00
Tactical light-55.00
Total of 564.00 invested. That is what I value it on a trade. 

I will look at trades of lesser value also. Can remove the Scope and tactical light, then were looking at around 375 in trade.

The PLR-22 pistol is chambered for the popular and economical .22 Long Rifle cartridge (.22LR). It is based on the 5.56mm NATO chambered PLR-16 pistol and shares many parts including the grip and front and rear sights. The PLR-22 is not a simple conversion kit, it is a standalone firearm chambered for the .22LR and is designed for target shooting, plinking, or small game hunting. The PLR-22 and SU-22 operate by blowback action and have a 4140 steel bolt that rides on steel guide rails inside the polymer receiver. The ejector is attached to one of the guide rails and the recoil spring is located above the barrel. The cross-bolt safety and magazine release operate identically to the PLR-16 and SU-16.

Calibers: .22LR
Weight unloaded: 2.8lbs
Length: 18.5""
Barrel length: 10.1""
Sight radius: 12.5""
Twist: 1:16""
Capacity: 26 rounds
Trigger pull: 5.5-7.5 lbs

The PLR-22 and SU-22 will accept many of the same accessories as the PLR-16 and SU-16 including the slings, stocks, and compact forend. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and the front sight is adjustable for elevation. An integrated picatinny rail on top will accept a multitude of sighting options. The muzzle end of the barrel is threaded ½""-28 to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake. A 26 round semi-transparent magazine is included and it will accept magazines designed for the Atchison M-16 conversion.

Gunkote is one of the most durable finishes available on the market, and will resist corrosion like none other. Acetone and brake cleaner act like water on this gun...they do absolutely nothing to the finish. The gun is very accurate for an AK pattern rifle, and it also features a chrome lined barrrel (16""). Besides the bolt, all the internals have been replaced with Tapco parts in order to remain 922r compliant. The gun features a G2 trigger group (polished by Dinzag Arms, the trigger pull is significantly better than standard AK's). I put a Tapco retaining plate in the gun, and the trigger guard is from Dinzag Arms. All of the holes which remained from conversion are filled with nylon plugs, also from Dinzag. The rear stock and pistol grip are by Tapco, and the gun features a tactical fore end (rail system) which also will retain a solid zero if optics are installed. The gun has had a Dinzag bullet guide installed...for those unfamiliar with Saiga rifles this is a feature which is necessary for high capacity magazines. Tapco Galil mags work wonderfully (minimal if any modification needed), and are cheap (less than $15) and easy to find. Bulgarian Circle 10 mags (or any .223 AK mag for that matter) will also function and may need some modification to fit properly, but I have no experience with them. The gun runs like a top, and I've never once had a jam. Low round count, under 300 to be specific. I'm including the factory Saiga magazine with the gun. The dust cover has been replaced by a mil spec ribbed version."

1st is a 1937 Mosin nagant. It is in good shape and I have fired it many times. I will throw in tools, bayonet, ammo pouch, and a few boxes of ammo.
2nd is and electronic safe I bought from bass pro to store my handguns and valuables. It was $125.00.
3rd is a remington .177 pellet rifle. It is perfect for pests and teaching kids firearms safety. Will come with bbs, pellets, and scope.
I am interested in all models of 12 gauges. I prefer the gun to be camo but will take anything. 
All together my items are worth around 350-400, but for the right gun I still would trade all three for something worth much less.

THE GOOD:  Bluing is 99% on this gun. IN FANTASTIC shape. Wood furniture is in 98% condition. Wood and finish is also in fantastic shape on this beauty.  IS a presafety model. No ugly wart safety growing off of the side of the receiver. Very short , Very compact. Shoots like a dream. handles like a dream! Very very mild recoil. IF my 4 year old was strong enough to hold the gun up. I'd feel safe letting him shoot it. He could handle the recoil on it. Extremely accurate. 44 mag packs more than enough punch to kill deer , hogs and bear.  Killed my fair share with a 44 mag and got pics to prove it lol.   Gun is factory drilled and tapped for a scope and does come with bases.

THE BAD:    nada darn thing. Its a winchester after all! and in a rifle thats hard to find. let alone find in this ones condition!

I am really looking for a 357 mag rifle. No junk. and ill probably be kinda picky on what i trade for. I may be open to other trade offers other than a 357 . so send away."

an extremely beautiful bridal ring set that I purchased in December 2010. Definitely has that ""wow"" factor with amazing detail on the setting. Size eight. Would be absolutely perfect if your girlfriend likes the antique/elegant look. Includes wedding band and engagement ring. Both pieces were custom made in Israel to proportionately match the center stone. The center stone is .62 carats. I do not remember the total diamond weight, so I will have appraised if the right buyer is interested enough. Another interesting thing about this set it that the setting and band are 18k white gold instead of 14k like what most rings are. Will trade for/towards guns.

(perhaps rub marks or oil on the metal when blued?) trigger is an aftermarket with side safety. it has a rear appeture mounted on the barrel with a red bead front sight. this setup makes target aquisition very quick. it's very accurate, the target if shot at 50 yards. i'm asking $850 shipped.

i do have this listed on other boards.

i might be interested in a trade for a 25-20, 358, 35 whelen, 348, or a BFR in 45/70.

I am looking to trade my S&W N-FRAME Double action revolver. This thing is nice and solid. The recoil of the .357 round is reduced to what feels more like my 40 cal XD or maybe even my gf's XD-9! This makes this weapon a very accurate and devastating little sidearm!!! I am mainly interested in trades, and will field ANY offer. I love firearms, so I'm sure you might have something laying around that I would love to trade for! I already have another S&W revolver, so this one can be gone for the right trade/price conditions.

The PS90’s 16"" cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel is equipped with an integrated muzzle brake to reduce recoil. The PS90’s safety switch is located inside the trigger guard for easy access. Dual magazine latches, cocking handles and an innovative synthetic thumbhole stock with a molded-in sling attachment point help make the PS90 fully ambidextrous.

This pistol is from one of the first production runs out of FN after Liege was liberated from the Germans, assembled from parts produced under German occupation but with all Liege/Allied markings (no German stamping of any sort). Based on the serial number, it was probably produced in late '44 or early '45. Smooth top slide, no rib, GI sights. Serial number is A60xx -- rare four digit with A series prefix.

I'm in no hurry to sell this as I don't really need the money or the Glock, this is just for my fun.

Includes one serial number matching 13rd FN (extremely rare type magazine with split tongue baseplate), two 13rd FN OEM mags, and two 15rd MecGar mags, Spegel style grips and original WWII grips, Israeli 1911 holster modified to fit the Hi Power, and a Hunter leather holster."

The Benelli M3 is an updated version of the Benelli M1 shotgun. The M3 uses the same inertia recoil semi-automatic system as the earlier Benelli M1, but adds another Benelli-patented feature, which allows the shooter to lock the semi-automatic action and switch to the manually operated pump-action mode and back in the matter of seconds. The action type switch is located at the forward end of the forearm, and is formed as an annular knurled ring. Rotation of this ring either engages the action rods of the pump system and locks the semi-automatic recoil system, or disengages the action bars, locks the forearm and allows the inertia recoil system to operate the action automatically. This greatly improves the versatility of the shotgun, allowing it to fire low-powered ammunition (mostly of special purpose, such as less-lethal rubber or tear-gas projectiles) in the manually operated pump action mode, and to fire full power combat loads with slugs or buckshot in rapid semi-automatic mode. An underbarrel tubular magazine usually holds 7-8 rounds for police or military versions."

The gun itself is in miraculous condition.  I don't believe it was ever fired before it came into my possession, and if it was it certainly wasn't used much.  The timing is accurate, the cocked SA trigger is crisp, and the bluing shows almost zero signs of wear.  I have personally put around 300 rounds through with no problems.  This gun has a 5"" barrel and standard checkered grips.

Included with the gun is the original cardboard sale case, though it has seen better days.  One side is cracked, and the name ""Hank"" is written on the top of the box.  Also written is the original sale price ($54.95).

The production date of this gun is 1986.  It features the normal wear and tear to the painted frame that you'll normally see on these military surplus guns, but not an exceptional amount -- mostly holster wear around the muzzle and front of the grip.

The firing action is very smooth (these guns are known for a crisp trigger with a quick reset).  The accuracy is very good, and the rifling is in top shape.  I imagine this was someone's carry gun for 15 years that didn't actually see much action aside from standard practice.  The gun has standard cz grips and matching serials.  It is a very pleasant shooter with minimal recoil for a blowback pistol.

Included with this package are two 12-round magazines and 524 rounds of 9x18 Brown Bear.  The ammo makes this a local sale only since shipping would get too pricey.

I am asking $425.  No lowballers please, I am in no hurry to sell -- just thinning the herd of my collection."
