from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short 
barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where 
maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. The Mini 14's simple, 
rugged garand-style action uses a breechbolt locking system, a fixed position 
gas system, and a self-cleaning moving gas cylinder to give it unparalleled 
reliability under harsh operating conditions. A heavy, hammer-forged barrel 
provides extra rigidity and accuracy.

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun."

Gotta have priorities, right?

I built this gun myself over the holidays in December and January. I have tested it with about 250 rounds and it functions perfectly. If you buy it, I'd be happy to show you how it all works.

Parts list:

* Spike's Tactical Calico Jack Stripped lower (custom painted engraving)
* AIM Surplus Upper receiver group
* Daniel defense 16"" mid-length barrel with A2 front sight
* PSA lower parts kit
* Magpul MOE handguard/stock
* Magpul MBUS rear sight
* Bushnell TRS-25 red dot sight
* Magpul AFG 
* 2x Magpul 30-round PMAG

The gun is sighted in for a standard 25/200yd military zero. The iron sights are fully cowitnessed with the red dot, so in the event that the red dot fails, you can flip up the rear sight continue shooting. Operators gotta operate.

I can throw in a carrying case, bore snake, and ammunition. Ammunition you'll have to pay for since it's so hard to find right now. 

I also have full reloading equipment for .223 if you are interested. This would be everything you need to upgrade your existing press to reload for .223. I have enough components to make 1,200 rounds of .223 ammo. If you want this, it would be $400 extra.

I'll accept offers on everything. I can only accept cash. Thanks!"

60 rounds of MFS steel case in boxes. Never shot this stuff so I don't have any insight on its quality.

Might work with you on price if taking multiple boxes.

The ammo gets fed into the mags using a spoon (see pic), or of course you can just slide the rounds off the clip and feed them into a mag by hand. Strippers/spoons work with PMAGs and USGI mags (and probably others as well, but I haven't tried with other mags). You can also use a StripLula with stripper clips.

I also have the Rock River ""Oh Shoot"" parts kit for $14 (these will work for all AR15's, not just Rock River AR15s). Not selling these separately, as it's not worth the time. More info on parts kits here: http://www.joeboboutfitters.com/product_p/rra-ar3256.htm"

I bought this motor cycle with intentions of getting my license and taking sunday rides here in the beautiful mountains of east TN.

My plans changed because of health issues. It is a near perfect bike as I said, and it is ready to take across the country if you want to. 

I never did get my license, but I did ride it in my driveway for a few miles.......I bought it last year and it has been covered ever since except for a weekly start and short ride just to keep it lubricated.

It has been professionally tuned and carbed........or whatever it is everyone wants to do to make it run better and has some kind of special exhaust system to make it breath better. I have the stock pipe that goes with it. All I can say is it is silky smooth. It is electric start and starts easily every time.

By the way, this bike has the famous 650, four stroke engine labeled as ""Bullet Proof"".

I am using the pictures that was used when I bought it, (notice oil cooler). I hate to sell, but medical issues have come up, and I won't be riding like I had wanted to do.

You can look at the pics and tell it's a beautiful bike. I bought it, got it insured and tagged......but I never got to ride it except in my driveway.

If you are interested in a near perfect bike that looks and runs amazing.........well actually I have never had it over about 20 MPH, so I can not say how it runs on the highyway, but I can assure you it would have more power than you would ever want and will run smooth as silk I am certain.

This is an amazing bike that I looked for for about 2 years before I found it. I am in no hurry to sell this bike, I just thought I would put it up for sale early for those early bird cycle people who is looking for that special bike. It is a special bike for someone who wants to take long rides often........it was my dream bike.

Email me for more specifics if you want to get the jump on a really nice bike before the spring thaw and you don't exactly fit on the ""other"" bigger bikes. This one is plenty big enough. This is a special purpose bike that could take you just about anywhere in the world you ever wanted to go.

I have the battery out now to preserve it in a heated space, so I would need a day to put it in and uncover the bike just to show it.

Please, serious inquiries only, thank you.

Thanks for taking the time to read this."

 By completing this class you will then be eligible to apply for your Kansas Carry Conceal License through the Attorney General's office.

 The class covers CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Self Defense, and Interaction with Law Enforcement. 

There is a written exam along with a shooting test. You don't need to worry about either test as I give you everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour course. 

I have no minimums on my classes and will NOT cancel them because I don't have enough people for the class. One person is all it takes.

 You can bring your own pistol for the shooting portion along with 50 rounds of ammunition. I recommend using a .22 however any caliber is accepted. If you don't have a pistol yet or would just like to borrow mine I have a .22 Ruger.

Certified CCH Instructor
 NRA Instructor

 By completing this class you will then be eligible to apply for your Kansas Carry Conceal License through the Attorney General's office.

 The class covers CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Self Defense, and Interaction with Law Enforcement. 

There is a written exam along with a shooting test. You don't need to worry about either test as I give you everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour course. 

I have no minimums on my classes and will NOT cancel them because I don't have enough people for the class. One person is all it takes.

 You can bring your own pistol for the shooting portion along with 50 rounds of ammunition. I recommend using a .22 however any caliber is accepted. If you don't have a pistol yet or would just like to borrow mine I have a .22 Ruger.
