The G26 fires the powerful 9mm cartridge while possessing 11 rounds, that is the combined capacity of a 6-shot Detective Special and a 5-shot Chiefs Special, with much less recoil and more deliverable accuracy at a faster rate of fire. The 4th Generation of the Glock Safe Action Pistol brings revolutionary design changes to the world's most popular pistol. Externally, what is immediately apparent is the multiple back strap design of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to small, standard and large frame hands.

The surface of the frame is the Gen4 Rough Textured frame scientifically designed, real world tested.

Internally, the Gen4 Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodated left or right handed operators.




This gun has literally had less than 50 rounds put through it. It has been kept in a Allen padded locking pistol case and then stored in my gun safe. The following will be included in this sell.

This receiver is complete with all factory OEM parts and is configured for 9mm (so it is set up for a Glock 26 upper), but will fit any Glock subcompact upper (like Glock 27 and 33). Comes with excellent condition Talon Grips (great grips, but easy to remove if its not to your liking).

Perfect for:
(1) Setting up as a dedicated training lower with a Glock dry fire practice kit (like the SWSA kit at http://southwestshootingauthority.com/612600.html). Just swap on your usual carry upper and practice with the same sight picture and trigger pull, then swap back to your carry lower when done.

(2) Keeping around as a spare lower for spare parts, troubleshooting other Glocks, etc. Nice compact way of keeping together all the parts from the receiver, ready to go.

(3) Modifying for a stippling or other grip modification project, but being able to go back to your stock frame if it is not to your liking.

Asking $200 cash FTF.

127,http://www.armslist.com/posts/708127,For Sale:   1920's SMITH & WESSON M&P Hand Ejector,"NW of City, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 275,"Listed On: Sunday, December 9, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here is a rare opportunity to acquire what is perhaps the most successful variant of S&W revolver in a very unusual condition: 
 This gun is an earlier (1920s) Military & Police or 'M&P' chambered in the ever popular .38 Special Cartidge and one of the most widely employed revolver types in history. The well worn grips look like later style 'magna's and probably date from the 1940s.
This revolver has seen some very hard use, and looks as if it was constantly carried by it's owner for decades....Like maybe one of the most extreme cases of 'pistol packing' in the 20th Century. 
 At the beginning of the ad I stated that this gun was in unusual condition: Unusually 'broken in' that is.. The finish is finished, the checkered grips  have a checkered past are worn slick, the bore is boring (OK, not rusty),  the single action is still very 'Smithlike'- but the DA has 'hitch in it's get along'. I look at as a built in safety feature to keep youngsters, arthritics, & a certain %-age of women from accidentally firing it on purpose.
Oh it works fine, but the hammer just has a little 'snag' on the way back on double action only.
 This gun has a lot of character & looks as if it were carried by it's owner constantly for many many years. The checkered grips are about slick, and the holster wear long ago went past the blueing & into the steel in a few places...You don't see many like this! 
 But except for that snag in the Double Action mode, the gun is still a very capable shooter. It is, after all, a Smith & Wesson!
 There is a story behind this gun too: It belonged to a recently deceased man that had collected hundreds of high condition rare & expensive firearms. Many were very valuable & rare S&Ws, and lots of those were still as new in their boxes. 
This one must have had a special place in his heart & his collection, is all that I can figure. 
If this gun could talk, it'd probably groan a little bit, forget a detail here & there- but tell a few tales that would span all human emotions. 
Character? Yup.
And plenty of it."

 Thanks for reading. The Target model has a 5.5"" Bull barrel. It is in good used condition with about 2k rounds through it (approx). The only flaw is a little marking on the rear sight adjustment screw, minor cosmetic scratches. I have the original box, the unused scope rail, the two factory mags, the owner's manual and all the original documents and stuff. I am the original owner. This gun has never given me any problems.
  I am in the Summit County area. Test shooting opportunities exist. Prefer FTF cash transaction. I am having trouble with my photo program, but am working on it. Some trades considered: Towards a S&W .22lr J-frame, Towards a G26, A Henry Lever action .22lr.

The obvious questions answered, if you were going to ask them:
 1) There is no forward assist or flip-down dust cover door, hence the ""slick side."" Nobody's used a forward assist on a rifle since 'Nam, anyway.

Here are the details from the Kel-Tec website. 

The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

Also, just for what its worth, the reason I am selling this rifle is that I’m getting out of rifles. With my astigmatism getting a clear focus on anything passed 50 yards (even with a scope) is rough on me.  Better off spending the time/money on practicing with my pistol / shotgun.  Only bringing this up since the gun is perfect, but wanted to give some background on why I am selling."

I've got a DMR's dream here!

Here is an excellent chance to get your hands on a Polytech M14S (M1A), two mags, and a scope mount!

The Polytech M1A has a one-piece FORGED receiver, unlike Springfields, which have a two piece cast receiver. The operating rod is also forged. These rifles are solid! Some were known to have 'soft' bolts, and this one has a hardened US bolt in it. These old baby's are interchangeable with most all M14 parts, and there are still plenty of those out and about. You'll hear a few people complain about these rifles, but the fact is Springfield puts out a few duds too. And these continually go up in price, as more and more people are learning about their potential. And, this is the only way to get a forged 1 piece receiver other than buying a NFA M14.

The rifle is in great shape for being from the late 1980's. As you know, Polytech was banned from importation after 1994, and these occasionally pop up. The walnut is in fantastic shape, the finish is almost 100%, and the rifle has a total round approximation of 100-180 rounds through it.

Oh, and the cleaning kit is original, and has never been opened. Still in the butt stock.

Two mags, a 20 round USGI and a 5 Round.

And a picatinny scope mount kit. Comes with all hardware, box and two ring bases.

This is one of the best setups for a Designated Marksman's Rifle. People who love the M1A builds absolutely drool over these rifles' receivers, and there's no limit to what you could do with it.

Of course, you can shoot to 800 meters all day long (and ACCURATELY!) with the iron sights alone.

Make someone's holidays happy.

Extra reading, for those who are interested. Taken from Lee Emerson's book on the M14, which can be found here: http://photos.imageevent.com/badgerdog/generalstor age/m14tecnicalfolder/M14%20RHAD%20Text%20Only%20E dition%20090425.pdf

Representatives from Poly Technologies met for five days with Smith Enterprise personnel, with David Keng of Keng’s Firearms acting as translator. The Poly Technologies representatives were supplied with a set of USGI drawings for the M14. During this first meeting, Poly Technologies sent raw forgings and assembled M14 rifles (Polytech serial numbers 00001 through 00005) to Smith Enterprise, Inc. for evaluation and testing. Ron Smith personally test fired these first five Poly Technologies M14 type rifles.

Smith Enterprise thoroughly examined and tested the Poly Technologies receivers and rifles. The receivers were found through spectrum analysis to be made of the Chinese equivalent of AISI 8620 alloy steel, the proper material for M14 receivers.

Karl Maunz was living in Atlanta, GA when Keng’s Firearms imported Poly Technologies M14/S rifles. Keng’s Firearms supplied him with two Poly Technologies M14/S rifles for testing and evaluation. He found the receiver to be made of equivalent AISI 8620 alloy steel. The receiver material testing conducted by Smith Enterprise and Karl Maunz was done independently of each other. The Chinese bolts, however, were not made of the USGI drawing specified steel alloy.
The Smith Enterprise testing included hardness testing of the Poly Technologies receiver core by cutting it apart. One Poly Technologies receiver was tested to destruction by loading ammunition to create excessively high chamber pressure. The very first Poly Technologies receivers were very hard, harder than a file, which left them without the toughness provided by the relatively soft core of receivers made according to USGI specifications. The Chinese quickly corrected this by strictly adhering to the receiver heat treatment procedure.

Think on that. Ron Smith assisted with the construction of the Polytech M14S"

Those serial # were 534000/599000.
 After the 8 September 1943 armistice between Italy and the Allies, the Germans saddled Beretta with three engineers from Germany. Moreover the factory was garrisoned by the waffen ss!!! 'armed security service' Weapons of that time, even the ones produced for the Germans, bore the punch mark 4UT, (Quarto Ufficio tecnico di Controllo Armi e Munizioni--4th Technnical Control Unit...
-an C. Still, in Axis Pistols, page 107, states,
""It is likely that almost all of the 4/UT, ...were used by the German Army"". He also includes two other variations in this statement, ""1944 dated and blank slide Model 1935"".
Ugo Menchini, in Pietro Beretta Le Automatiche, regarding an M1934, page 255, states,
""In late 1940 there appears an oval including the punch mark IVU. It refers to the 4th technical Control Unit of the FAG, where inspection was carried out.""
 Note that, while they seem to represent the same inspectors, the ""IVU"" is not the same mark as the ""4UT"". The IVU would be found on the pre RSI model M1934, and the 4UT would be found on the RSI model M1935.
 These are the reasons why I believe that it is likely that all of the 4UT Berettas WERE RSI pistols!! the IVU and the 4UT were the same office, but under Italian management -the IVU, before the surrender of Italy, and German the 4UT, so after september, 8 1943.........

Mussolini was rescued by German paratroopers led by Otto Skorzeny. He was then installed by the Germans as the President of the Italian Social Republic (RSI). The RSI was to be an Italian regime which was to nominally administer the German-occupied northern Italy. As the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale (MVSN, also known as ""Black Shirts"") was disbanded by the terms of the armistice, the Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana was formed on 24 November 1943. The ""Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana"" was formed out of local police, ex-army, and others still loyal to the fascist cause.  
 pistol is in near unissued condition and a prime example of strain on axis weapons fabrication late in the war, with tooling and machinery marks throughout, it comes with one extra original period magazine!!!!!!!!

I am the second owner and to my best estimation it has been fired less than 100 rounds. I have personally fired this rifle and could easily shoot a 2"" group at 50 yards and hit a 6"" target every time at 100 yards with the iron sights and military surplus ammo. My vision is poor or I think the gun would do better. Nice trigger. Perfect function. The scope mount is made by Basset Machine. Very solid mount and according to the manufacturers website, guarantees 1/2"" MOA return to zero when you remove and reinstall the mount. The mount sits high enough to allow the use of the iron sights with the scope mounted. The scope pictured is a cheap Simmons which I place no value on whatsoever. I don't think it holds a zero, but is useful to see my shot placement with the iron sights. Fully cleaned and oiled. CASH. NO TRADES other than a S&W 5906 in perfect condition."
