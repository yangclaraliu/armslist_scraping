Fixed front A2 sight post, and a rear flip up rear sight; perfect for anyone wanting to mount a red dot scope.

Windam is an excellent and superior AR, best bang for the buck! After Bushmaster was sold to Remington, the previous Bushmaster owner retained the equipment and hired back the laid off Bushmaster staff to create a new company in a new location outside of liberal NY; now located in Windham, Maine. The result is a superior weapon; lower receiever made of T-6 aircraft aluminum, chrome lined bolt carrer, gas keys, bolt and chamber! Windham is very rapidly coming up the food chain with their high quality and reputable AR's with their deep roots in the AR community and platoform. This is from the creators/owner of Bushmaster, but raised the bar to make it better!! All parts are 100% American made, and comes with a transferrable lifetime warranty.

Other items worth note; the weapon comes in a hard carrying case, includes sling, one high capacity 30 round magazine, and all original paperwork. Again, best bang for the buck; upper is smooth and butter, trigger is crisp, and its lighter than all the ARs I own. New in box and unfired! It has the forward assist and ejection port cover, and 6 point adjustable collapsable buttstock.

Included in sale, I will even throw in a Magpul flip up rear sight, which is almost impossible to find in local stores.

Please email with any questions. I was only able to upload one picture due to Armslist limited file fize to upload. If you would like additional pictures please let me know!

The particular model which I have for sale was their top-of-the-line Big Five model. The Big Five, according to the literature and information given by Mrs. Betty Ekin, friend of Howard Hill and, along with son Craig, operator of the Howard Hill Archery Company, was patterned after the famous “Sweetheart” Hill's favorite bow.  This bow is constructed of laminated bamboo per Hill’s design. The belly and face of the Big Five bow are both backed by glass.
The bow that I am offering was made in 1974 (one year before Mr. Hill passed away) and is 70"" long and set up for 70 lbs. at a 29"" draw length. Because it was custom made for me it sports...""Custom made for My Name"". This is painted on and could be easily removed. I used the bow to hunt whitetail for a few years so there are some superficial scratches (nothing deep). I would recommend having a bowyer make a new string as the one I have is frayed in places.

The Viridian Green Laser Sub-Compact Green Laser Sight with Universal Mount and Tactical Light C5L is the world's only subcompact weapon-mountable green laser! And amazingly, the Viridian C5L also incorporates a 100 lumen tactical light. In fact the Viridian C5L Laser Sight is so tiny that it tucks neatly between trigger guard and muzzle with no overhang. This Laser Sight will work with virtually any railed pistol. The Viridian C5L Handgun Laser Sight lets you carry optimum visibility, maximum deterrence and total effectiveness into any situation. It may be the smallest laser sight / tactical light combo ever built. The sub-compact laser scope fits handguns by Glock, Springfield XD, Walther, Beretta, Colt, FNH, SIG Sauer, and anything with a rail! The Viridian C5-L delivers incredible accuracy when it is needed most."

I bought it new 18 months ago. Shot maybe 300 rounds through total. Extremely accurate at 300+ yards, have the targets to prove it. AT 300 yards you may as well be shooting at 25 yards with this rifle. 5.45 is very accurate and cheap. 10 cents a round in good times, 23 cents a round now. The Hollow point 'Poison round"" is the preferred caliber of the Russian paramilitary forces. For good reason. Chrome lined barrel, bolt hold open, etc....all there.

One of my all time favorites, but my kid needs a van so something has to go. However, it won't break my heart if it does not sell.

Comes with a 10 round clip and 2 Magpul 30 round clips. Never used to 30 rounders. I have a Muller Tactical scope 8.5 -25x44 on it. I will consider selling it as well if you like mounted on leupold rings. But I would want 75 bucks for it, new they run about 170.00, but perform like a Leupold in my opinion. 

I will sell my ammo for 15 cents per round to the buyer only or 23 cents if you don't buy it. No pics, but its stock, easy to see what they look like but I can guarantee its in great shape. i keep all my guns in great shape. 

Or 1100 for the package. They run about a grand new if you can even find one, Saiga in my opinion are some of the best. Much better than Century or similar copies.

PRP Ultimate Match Target Trigger Kit XD

This is almost as good as sending your XD in to us for a trigger job with out the add cost of shipping. The kit includes our famous striker safety lever, to remove the long trigger pre-travel on the XD trigger. Reduced power trigger and sear springs, to lower the pull weight. Our new sear that has a patented angle to help lighten the pull and give a smooth crisp break and our new trigger. The trigger is made of tough, light weight polymer that helps speed up the reset. It also has an integral over travel stop on the back of the trigger. Using this method of over travel stop removes added stress on the trigger bar that are present with any of the other over travel stop method. When installed correctly, the kit will give you a short crisp trigger pull (about 3.5-4lbs) with a fast reset and cut the total trigger pull length by about 1/2. The kit requires minor fitting and includes gunsmith installation instructions. Fits all XD models (EXCEPT the XD 45 thumb safety model). This trigger is a Springfield Armory OEM part available on production XD and XDM pistols from the factory (see APPENDIX D4 — 21.6 Production Division Rules).

Unmolested but ready to be bubba - ized , tacti -cooled, or just shoot the heck out of it like it was designed for. Has the grenade launcher still attached as well as the bayonet. NO, I have NO grenades to include with this gun, let alone anything for you to stick the bayonet into, LOL . I may be talked into including some ammo, depending on the final price, though. BONUS BONUS BONUS I also found a 30 round HI CAP mag that I will include. That will get you started on your 922r compliant conversion for the ultimate tactical SKS . Bore is great and the gun shows a lot of character. It even has a Yugoslavian soldiers name carved into the stock. I wonder if Tito had him beheaded for destruction of state property? Maybe he was just court martialed for grafitti, lol.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are a effing retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."
