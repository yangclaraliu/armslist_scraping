The stock has some small dings, There are some chips out of the varnish finish around the butt plate. The bore is excellent. The blued barrel has a few minor scratches. Some BP corrosion spots about the nipple area. The brass needs polish.. This rifle was not used in reenactments, It was used in the 70’s for a few years on weekends target shooting. I used it once in a competition and took first place in 100 yard open sights. This is powerful enough for any North American game I understand.

I have an absolutely beautiful Kimber Ultra CDP ll available for sale or trade plus cash. This gun is the best looking gun I have ever seen hands down. It has made two trips to the range firing exactly 2 boxes of ammunition each time. One box of 50 FMJ and one box of 20 personal protection. Without a hiccup. I bought this gun to carry but it's such a nice looking gun I can't get myself to carry it because I don't want to damage it from everyday carry. It does not have a scratch on it. The gun retails for $1,331 on the Kimber website seen here..

Model 6280
Level II Retention Duty Holster, Mid-Ride

The Safariland Model 6280 holster is the base model of Self Locking System (SLS™) series of holsters. It includes a unique rotating hood design. This holster also features a Universal Belt Loop that mounts on a 2"" or 2.25"" Duty Belt. With no snap, the Safariland 6280 holster’s SLS™ design allows for a smoother single-motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways. The hood can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. It is also far less likely to release accidentally than conventional thumb break snaps. The 6280 holster features a tensioning device, which, when firmly adjusted becomes a Level III Retention™ holster.

Model 6280
Level II Retention Duty Holster, Mid-Ride

The Safariland Model 6280 holster is the base model of Self Locking System (SLS™) series of holsters. It includes a unique rotating hood design. This holster also features a Universal Belt Loop that mounts on a 2"" or 2.25"" Duty Belt. With no snap, the Safariland 6280 holster’s SLS™ design allows for a smoother single-motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways. The hood can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. It is also far less likely to release accidentally than conventional thumb break snaps. The 6280 holster features a tensioning device, which, when firmly adjusted becomes a Level III Retention™ holster.

The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal Silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

It is in great shape overall with a low round count. The fiber optic front sight has a little wear on it but still looks ok and functions well. This gun is a blast to shoot and highly desirable since it will fire 357 or 38's. These Colts are getting harder to find at a decent price these days since they got out of the revolver game. The Peacekeeper was only produced three years so they are pretty rare. I prefer to trade but would accept cash but PLEASE do your research about what these go for before making cash offers so you do not waste either of our times.

There are two types of these replicas: One type is made in China and of very poor quality, the other is made in Germany in the same factory and same casts as original Hitler youth knifes. This knife is the type made in Germany. This knife is the exact same as someone in the Hitler Youth would receive during the third reich. The blade is very strong and says ""Blut und Ehre!""(""Blood and Honor!"" in German). It has some slight surface discoloration(was like that when I bought it but I never bothered polishing it) which should be easily polished off. The blade has some marks from when I pulled it out fast or put in back in the frog fast. That should also be easily polished off. It has a slight chip on the sheath(also like that when I bought it). I bought it because I've always been interested in WW2 and, unfortunately, I have to sell it because I recently bought a Rimfire rifle and need to sell some stuff. 
It's a neat collector's item that any person interested in WW2/war should have!

I originally had this knife listed for $30 but I've dropped it to $25, don't miss this deal!"

In 2001, DPMS expanded from its share of the .223/5.56mm market, and exploded onto the .308 rifle scene. The LR-308, the first and foremost of the .308 line, and for which the rifle series is named, is a rifle to be reckoned with. So much so that it was named the NRA Rifle of the year in 2005.  With a 24” stainless bull barrel, 1 in 10 twist, free floating handguard and a high ride receiver for easier mounting of optics, the LR-308 has gone toe to toe with bolt action rifles and delivered comparable accuracy, with higher magazine capacity and rate of fire. The conventional thought that ""only a bolt action could be considered a precision rifle"" has been in contention ever since.  With numerous upgrades available, the LR-308 is the ultimate long range target and competition rifle.

It originally came with a 21"" cantilever barrel but my son wanted that so I put on his slug barrel with a rifled choke. There are normal signs of use, mostly light marks seen on the special purpose finish of the receiver. The synthetic stock and for end appear unmarked at all. I would like to receive at least $400 for this shotgun. 

As I switched barrels with my son, I also have his Leupold 11-87 shotgun mount and 1.5-6X38mm S&W scope. These scopes were made in Japan for S&W for a few years and are fine scopes comparable to Bushnell Elite 3200 series scopes - look 'em up. I did not put it on the gun as those mounts do slightly mark the finish of the receiver and I felt like selling it with the gun would be an option not a required part of the deal. So if you want the scope and mount also I would like another $150."

The frame is made from polymer, with detachable grip panels. The overall design is slightly different from earlier SIG-Sauer pistols such as P220 or P226, as there is no separate disassembly lever on the frame and the slide stop lever looks quite different. 

This pistol is solidly built. The sig pro has fewer parts, long lived and flexible polymer, removable one piece fire-control unit for easily switching between DAO or DA/SA, four point safety system, reversible magazine release, modular grips, integral accessory rails (not picatinny but there are converters), non snag design, beefed up pins, beefed up springs, beefed up slide rails, etc. This pistol is built to be tough, long lasting, and have low maintenance.

The new Nitron impregnated stainless steel slide seems to be a lot better than the old P229 setup. The sig pro costs an average of $200 less than the P229 to boot.

The SIG Pro is marketed as a lightweight and compact alternative to the ""legacy"" SIG-Sauer handguns in an increasingly competitive and budget-oriented law enforcement market. 

It is a fantastic gun that has only been shot twice, with only a few hundred rounds total in its lifetime. It was properly cleaned after each time. It feels great in the hand. There are no problems with the gun and it fires perfectly every time.

It comes with 3 10-round magazines as well as an original Sig .357 factory barrel so you can shoot either .40 S&W or .357 Sig. You can also find after-market barrels to shoot 9mm. The barrel change is all that is necessary to shoot .40, .357 or 9mm. The slide, frame, recoil assembly, and magazines stay the same. 

Sig Pro Pro's compared against the more expensive Sig P229
    Lighter
    Overall better stock trigger
    Less expensive by about 2 to 3 hundred dollars
    Robust factory grips really eat recoil
    More resistant to corrosion by water, sweat, and so forth

I am only selling because I want to help my church out with their kids expansion and this gun is just collecting dust and not being used. I really have nowhere to go shoot it right now anyway. 

I'm asking $300, but if you want to pay more for it, that's fine, the money will be donated to my church and you can write a check straight to the church for the final purchase price, no money will go to my pocket. Think of it this way, you get a really nice gun and the kids get more room to learn about GOD and play at church. It's a win/win situation."
