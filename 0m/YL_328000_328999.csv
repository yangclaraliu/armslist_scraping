If you have never shot a CZ you need to! This comes with 5 Mags, night sights and is in very good condition. If you dont know anything about CZ you should def look them up.  

The NATO P-01 is based on the CZ 75, the most used service pistol in the world. Over 60 countries use it as the standard side arm of their Armies, National police forces, National security agencies or other Law enforcement organizations. No other pistol can make this claim.

The NATO CZ P-01 is the culmination of several years of exhaustive design and testing. Ceska Zbrojovka has always had some of the most rigorous testing requirements in the world but, the Czech National police has required that they go even further, the testing regiment for this new pistol was the most demanding anyone has ever encountered. There are almost 20 specific requirements covering everything from accuracy to interchangability, from safety to reliability/durability and everything in between.

THE REQUIREMENTS THIS GUN WENT THROUGH TO GET NATO APPROVED:


The pistol must be 100% reliable in extreme conditions, the following is a list of some of the minimum requirements.

Must be able to complete the following without failure:

4000 dry firings 
3000 De-cockings
Operator level disassembly 1350 times with out ware or damage to components.
Complete disassembly 150 times, this is all the way down, pins, springs etc.
100% interchangability, any number of pistols randomly selected, disassembled, parts mixed and reassembled with no failures of any kind including loss of accuracy.


Safety requirements:

Drop test
1.5 meter (4.9”) drop test, this is done 54 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked. Dropping the pistol on the butt, the muzzle, back of the slide, sides of the gun, top of the slide, in essence, any angle that you could drop the gun from. This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing.

3meter drop (9.8”) 5 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked, This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing.

After these tests are complete the gun must fire without service.

The factory contracted an independent lab to do additional testing on guns that previously passed the drop tests. These pistol were dropped an additional 352 times without failure.

The pistol must also complete an environmental conditions test: 
This means cold, heat, dust/sand and mud.
The pistol must fire after being frozen for 24 hours at –35C (-36F).
The pistol must fire after being heated for 24 hours at 70C (126F)
The pistol must fire after being submerged in mud, sand and combinations including being stripped of oil then completing the sand and mud tests again.

Service life:
The service life requirement from the Czech police was 15,000 rounds of +P ammo!
The pistol will exceed 30,000 rounds with ball 9mm.

Reliability:
The reliability requirements for the P-01 pistol are 99.8%, that’s a .2% failure rate. 
This equals 20 stoppages in 10,000 rounds or 500 “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) 
During testing, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired, this is a .05% failure rate, a MRBF rate of 2142 rounds! Over 4 time the minimum acceptable requirement.
The U.S. Army MRBF requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols with 115 grain"

Like guns, these ancient tools & weapons have always been good investments, hold their value well, increase in value over time and are lots of fun to collect.

Please contact me if interested. You need to let me know what you have to trade or I probably won't respond. I will be glad to send pictures and descriptions of my items but I may ask to see yours first so I can make offers within a particular price range (ie; if you have a $600 gun I can show you some $600 pieces). I might trade higher-in-value items for a gun I really like.

This Sight is in NEW/Excellent Condition. No scratches or dings whatsoever. This Sight has never been used. I mounted it on my Remington R15 and has been in a gun case and not used since the optic was purchase.  I hate to see it unused. Otherwise a great sight I have an older version on one of my other rifles and have been extremely happy with it. Any questions feel free to email.
Will send pictures upon your request. I was unable to upload them from my mobile.

XPS2
Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount. Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.
 

Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space 
Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours
The XPS2 is not Night Vision compatible, for Night Vision compatibility see the XPS3 sights.

-Has been FULLY 922r compliance converted as you can see; The FCG (fire control group) has been moved forward. There has also been a gas port modification made to the shotgun porting the holes in the barrel into the gas block from .074"" to .096"" (3 of them) opening up the ports to allow for MUCCCH better reliability with light loads like birdshot. Will fire ANYTHING you put through this thing 3"" length or smaller. Factory unconverted (and some that have not had the gas port mod) Saiga 12's have LOTS of issues with FTE (failure to eject) with light loads like birdshot because it doesn't have enough to ummphh to kick the bolt carrier back far enough to cycle the next shell. That is NOT a problem with this gun.

-SUPER RELIABLE. Has MD Arms (premiere) 5 setting gas regulator, Krebs Custom Combat Shotgun Sight and Krebs Custom rear wide combat peep sight. Comes with factory Izhmash 5 round magazine. FCG is Tapco G2 and very smoooth and real LIGHT trigger. Warsaw length AK stock and S.A.W. style pistol grip. This thing is loaded with aftermarket options and comes with factory OEM Russian stock and hand guard. Also has gas tube heat shield (very nice looking). I am asking $1000 for this shotgun because of the work, time and $ I have put into it.

Also has CSS billet trigger guard, comfortable Russian style (grenade launcher) slip on butt pad. This thing is awesome. Will fire as fast as your trigger finger can pull and cycle every shell. Does not come with a muzzle brake although it is threaded and ready for any kind available for this gun (there are LOTS). I also have lost the AR15 style sight post that goes in the Krebs Custom Combat Shotgun Sight housing. Is threaded for and will take ANY AR style sight post.






I'll even throw in a 6 point collapsible M4/AR style stock that will fit it.

-Has been FULLY 922r compliance converted as you can see; The FCG (fire control group) has been moved forward. There has also been a gas port modification made to the shotgun porting the holes in the barrel into the gas block from .074"" to .096"" (3 of them) opening up the ports to allow for MUCCCH better reliability with light loads like birdshot. Will fire ANYTHING you put through this thing 3"" length or smaller. Factory unconverted (and some that have not had the gas port mod) Saiga 12's have LOTS of issues with FTE (failure to eject) with light loads like birdshot because it doesn't have enough to ummphh to kick the bolt carrier back far enough to cycle the next shell. That is NOT a problem with this gun.

-SUPER RELIABLE. Has MD Arms (premiere) 5 setting gas regulator, Krebs Custom Combat Shotgun Sight and Krebs Custom rear wide combat peep sight. Comes with factory Izhmash 5 round magazine. FCG is Tapco G2 and very smoooth and real LIGHT trigger. Warsaw length AK stock and S.A.W. style pistol grip. This thing is loaded with aftermarket options and comes with factory OEM Russian stock and hand guard. Also has gas tube heat shield (very nice looking). I am asking $1000 for this shotgun because of the work, time and $ I have put into it.

Also has CSS billet trigger guard, comfortable Russian style (grenade launcher) slip on butt pad. This thing is awesome. Will fire as fast as your trigger finger can pull and cycle every shell. Does not come with a muzzle brake although it is threaded and ready for any kind available for this gun (there are LOTS). I also have lost the AR15 style sight post that goes in the Krebs Custom Combat Shotgun Sight housing. Is threaded for and will take ANY AR style sight post.






I'll even throw in a 6 point collapsible M4/AR style stock that will fit it.

It is the most accurate rifle I have ever fired, but I am moving soon and will not be able to shoot long distance. It has about 50 rounds through it and has been cleaned and lubed properly after every 5 rounds.  It is a very sought after rifle for long distance shooting and shoots the more affordable 308 round.
The scope is a Simmons Whitetail 6.5-20 50 with mil dots.
I will include the brass of the rounds (Hornandy Match and Federal Gold) that have been shot.
There are an estimated 500 of these rifles in the country. The only reference for price I could find is here: http://www.gunsamerica.com/970353496/Guns/Rifles/Steyr-Rifles/Steyr_SBS_Tactical_Heavy_Barrel_308_Wi.htm
It has a 4 round magazine and comes with the original box and papers.
With the accessories that makes the package value at well over 1500 dollars, so I think this is a fair price but I can be flexible depending on the trade.

These are virtually impossible to find! This is absolutely the only one for sale on the net right now! Collectors are snatching these up and locking them away. This gun comes with everything shown in the pictures, namely: 2 single-stacked 8 round magazines Cleaning rod Stock blue Beretta hard plastic case Also, for an additional $25, I will include factory Beretta stainless parts to replace the black ones (everything except the trigger and hammer)."

For sale is my Black Beauty, a piece that is perfect for pistol whipping and bitch slapping.  This gorgeous deep blue 1911 will have heads turning.  Its
New in the box and has never once been fired.

I have taken her out of the box, field stripped, cleaned, and oiled her up with the baddest gun oil on the market!! ZOMBIE BLOOD!

This Taurus 9 + 1 Round 38 Super w/Blue Barrel/Black Grips/Gold Accent/Rail comes in .38 Super caliber.  Obviously she 100% Semi-Automatic and has a 5"" barrel.  This badass bitch features a Ambidextrous safety, Heinie Front, Bomar Rear sights, Black grips, Blued W/Gold Highlights finish, one 9 rd mag, and weighs approximately 40.5 oz. 

Before I picked her up, I had been quietly lurking the 1911 forums and learned about the Taurus PT1911.... all feedback was amazing. My summary of the research (I own another one of these as well).
1: Accurate, very accurate.
2: Majority of owners are very happy and have zero breakage issue.
3: Most factory railed 1911 start at ~$1100 (SA and Kimber).
4: Did I mention it being more accurate than many 1911s costing 3x more?

Available to ship to your local FFL shipped via UPS (you pay next day shipping) or obviously this can be picked up locally.  MUST HAVE FOID CARD

The finish is highly polished and blued
The grip is Cocobolo wood
The hammer and trigger are highly polished 
The trigger is much smoother

It feels like a Smith & Wesson trigger.  The trigger is so smooth and easy, unlike most Ruger revolver triggers.  I bought this brand new and have put exactly 20 rounds though it.  It is an amazingly accurate and tough .357, and hard to find in this finish.  

It is 100% stock and comes in Ruger box with other misc. documentation that came with it.  I don't have to sell it, so please don't bother lowballing.  Will verify CO driver's license or CCW permit and exchange info/bill of sale.  No felons.  Thanks!"

633,http://www.armslist.com/posts/328633,For Sale:  1984 INVADER 20 FOOT CABIN CUDDY 225 HP VOLVO INBOARD / OUTBOARD W 316 HOURS,"Jacksonville / Richlands, Jacksonville, North Carolina","$ 6,000","Listed On: Tuesday, March 6, 2012",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Will consider M4 variant as partial payment.

This is a 1984, 20"" 3' Invader Cabin Cuddy with a Inboard/Outboard 225HP Volvo Engine with only 316 hours. I am the 3rd owner. I know the previous owner (who knew the original owner). I bought this when I was in Parris Island, and I LOVED it. I hate to get rid of it, but I have some new hobbies, and an aggressive training schedule at work so that means I just don't get out on the water as much as I would like. I know that it is a little bit older, but the boat and engine are solid. I used to take this with my family on 60 mile round trip runs when I was in SC with NO problems. 

It seats 6 without using the cabin cuddy, or converting the front seats to bench seats. If you convert the driver seat and the passenger seat to bench seats it seats 8.  I bought a new radio and fish finder in 2010 which are included.  I bought a new battery last week. Also included are 
-(3) recreational towing inter tubes
-Hand Held GPS
-Anchor and chain
-Bumpers
-More than enough life jackets to support any adult / kid combination you might take out with you ( roughly 7 and 7 ). 

The speedometer doesn't work (easy fix, just a broken needle) but I am including a GPS that I use to gauge my speed / find my way home. 

I know it's a slightly older boat than some of the other boats you might see, but this is worth every penny. I have never had a problem with the boat, and until 2010, this boat has never seen everything but fresh water. I have taken it as far as 10 miles off shore with no problems. I have thoroughly washed the boat down every time it was taken out.

Full disclosure. The trailer could use some work. I have towed the trailer from Ohio to South Carolina, and then to North Carolina. The hydraulic brakes on the trailer need to be rebuilt. There is rust damage on the trailer. It was that way when I bought the boat, I just never got around to fixing it.  For short jaunts to your local boat ramp, you will be fine, but if you plan on taking it long distances you will probably want to get the breaks fixed and the trailer checked out.

I am asking $6000 OBO. It's a great way to spend your tax refund. It's an AWSOME way to spend your summer. I don't need to sell, so if I don't get a good offer, I'll keep the boat. Reply to the ad and I will get back to you as soon as possible. I leave for CA till May in a few weeks, so act now!

This is a 1967 Ford F100 Styleside Shortbed with a 300 inline engine with 65136 ORIGINAL MILES.  I am the third owner of this truck and purchased this truck in February of 2008 as my daily driver.  When I bought the truck it had 61,084 miles.  During the four years I owned it I NEVER had a problem with it. I believe I am the third owner.  The person I bought it from said he was the second owner and that he bought it from his neighbor.  He said the engine was rebuilt in 2005ish.

Over the four years I had it, I changed the oil regularly, replaced the battery, cleaned the fuel tank, replaced the fuel filter, replaced the entire front drum brakes (drums, shoes, springs and cylinders), plugs and points, and a handful of hoses along the way.

Obviously as a 45 year old truck it has some wear, but it is a beautiful truck and I can't go anywhere without getting compliments on it.  I have had many offers on it over the years (including a straight trade on my bosses jeep that he later sold for $11,000), but now I am ready to sell it.  I never planned on selling it, but after moving to North Carolina other hobbies have taken my time and I just don't drive it like I used to nor do I have the time and money to do the things to it I would like to.

This is a wonderful daily driver and a great project truck.  If you look at the pictures you will notice the wood bed.  The steel bed underneath is solid, but was a pretty banged up.   I always wanted a wood bed, and this was a proof of concept. Three and a half years ago it looked stunning.  If I had to do it over again, I would do some things differently in the type of wood I used, but as a $350 proof of concept it worked great.  I can show you pictures of how it looked when I first installed it, if you want to get an idea of what the potential is.

I am not a mechanic - but this truck is extremely easy to work on and was a lot of fun. I have lots of parts I am including.  Here is a rough list.

-All three shop manuals in PDF Format on CD.
-Mirrors
-Door Handles
-Tail Lights
-Knobs
-Hoses
-Side Doors
-Hood
-Front panel (Can't remember if it's left or right)
-Steel Grill (instead of aluminum one that's installed)
-Steel Headlight Bezels
-Front Bumper
-More, but I can't remember off the top of my head

This really is a beautiful truck

I am asking $7500 OBO.   I believe it is a fair price.  I don't need to sell, and really don't want to sell it but... since I rarely drive it, I can't bear to have it sit in my driveway and fall into disrepair.  It is now time for it to find a new home.  I am negotiable, but if I don't get a fair offer, I'll keep it. Reply to the ad and I will get back to you as soon as possible. I leave for CA till May in a few weeks, so act now!

For the unfamiliar, this is the larger framed Colt model introduced in 1927. The basic design had been around since about 1900, and it saw both police and military use until the Official Police ended production in 1969. This is not the smaller 'Police Positive,' which was was also available in .38 and is more commonly seen with a short barrel. Both guns are often referred to as 'police specials.'

This particular piece was made in the late 50's, and features the traditional Colt blued finish and original real wood grips. Original 6"" barrel.

Functionally the gun is great. Cylinder locks in tight, firing pin is in good shape. Double action trigger pull is very smooth. Firing it single action is also nice, but you need to be careful- once the hammer is cocked, it takes a very light touch of the trigger to drop it. To me, that's a good thing...it's a good safe revolver with a trusty DA, but also an excellent target plinker when you use it in SA. Barrel/rifling is pristine and this gun is very accurate.

As far as looks go, there is a lot of bluing remaining, but the gun exhibits the typical holster wear of a used service revolver. Most notably, the right side grip has been worn smoother than the left, and there are worn spots on the outside of the barrel from going in and out of the holster.

I'm asking $435 or best offer."

 After buying this beauty in December of 2005, AND NEVER EVEN CAMPING IN IT ONE TIME, Grandma has decided to let her ""baby"" go. She had wanted an Airstream for YEARS!!! A little over 6 years ago, she found this beauty and made it her own. To make sure she wouldn't have any problems when she went camping, the unit was taken to All Certified RV in Forsyth and dropped off. She told them to GO COMPLETELY THRU IT and FIX ANYTHING THEY FOUND WRONG...and, THEY DID!!! Everything completely checked out and repaired. She has the receipt from them showing all their work and $1300 worth of repairs. After the ""tune-up"", the trailer was pulled back to the house and parked under a new cover. IT HASN'T BEEN MOVED SINCE...AND NEVER CAMPED IN SINCE SHE'S OWNED IT!!! She has decided to let someone else enjoy her ""baby""...here's what she said....it's a 1972 Airstream Overlander, 27 foot. It is basically all original. It has twin beds, 2 way refrigerator, air, heat, oven, awning, electric jack on the tongue and new carpet. It has a rear bath with stool, sink, tub and shower. The tires are good and a new battery was installed during the tune-up. It has 2-30 lb. propane bottles. The camper is clean, inside and out. Although it is NOT PERFECT, i would call it in ""pristine condition"" for a trailer THAT IS 40 YEARS OLD!!! Check out the pictures. She can answer any of your questions or concerns...and, we can email you pictures of anything you would like to see. Airstreams of this age AND CONDITION are getting harder and harder to find. Don't pass up this opportunity!!! Grandma's needin' $10,000, but might be willin' to negotiate a little to make sure her ""baby"" has a good home. Thanks for your interest and please email any questions you might have. GOOD LUCK!!!"
