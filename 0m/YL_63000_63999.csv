(B9) May a nonlicensee ship a firearm by carrier?
A nonlicensee may ship a firearm by carrier to a resident of his or her own state or to a licensee in any state. A common or contract carrier must be used to ship a handgun. In addition, Federal law requires that the carrier be notified that the shipment contains a firearm and prohibits common or contract carriers from requiring or causing any label to be placed on any package indicating that it contains a firearm. [18 U. S. C. 922( a)( 2)( A) and 922( e), 27 CFR 178.31]

B8) May a nonlicensee ship a firearm through the U. S. Postal Service?
A nonlicensee may mail a shotgun or rifle to a resident of his or her own state or to a licensee in any state. Handguns are not mailable. A common or contract carrier must be used to ship a handgun. A nonlicensee may not transfer any firearm to a nonlicensed resident of another state. The Postal Service recommends that longguns be sent by registered mail and that no marking of any kind which would indicate the nature of the contents be placed on the outside of any parcel containing firearms."

GAMO Whisper Silent Cat .22cal (NOT .177cal) break barrel air rifle. Rated by manufacturer at 950fps (~15-20 foot pounds energy depending on ammo). Box comes with rifle, 25rds of GAMO PBA Platinum ammo and a 4x32 GAMO air rifle scope with rings. Rifle has fiber optic sights if you don't want to use the scope.

The .22 version is quite nice - powerful and accurate.
This version seems to be new from GAMO - it still isn't listed on their website and it is hard to find. The stock feels solid and the design lets it be held and fired with confidence. I ordered one too many...have no use for a third one.

Description for EOTech Complete Holographic Sight System 5573XFTS :
EOTech introduces the latest in their line of innovative,performance driven products designed to aid the modern day war fighter - the MPO (Multi-Purpose Optic). EOTech 557 HoloSight employs a true Heads-Up Display that eliminates blind spots,constricted vision,or the tunnel vision associated with tubed sights,but the buttons have been moved from the back to the left side for instant access,allowing a magnifier,night vision,or a back up iron sight to fit closely to the HoloSight body. Its new button position allows to operate the EOTech 557 HoloSight function switches easier than ever before. The EOTech Complete Holographic Sight System 5573XFTS MPO is configured with a new ballistic matching reticle image for the M4 carbine. The reticle provides 4 aiming dots for target distances of 0-300m,400m,500m,and 600m. Only through the unique optical properties of holography,the aiming dots remain 1MOA in size,regardless of magnification (yet your target has increased in size by 3 times). EOTech Complete Holographic Sight System 5573XFTS provides a solution for engaging threats in CQB situations,then quickly transitioning to a 500m targeting or surveillance situation,and then quickly back to a 25m room clearing exercise. Instant transition is achieved through Flip-to-Side mount (FTS) that offers a simple,quick disconnect feature to remove the 3X Magnifier. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This EOTech durable,Night Vision Compatible Complete Holographic Sight System 5573XFTS offers wide field of optical performance with superior light transmission for visibility in extreme low light conditions.

This is in 45/90 caliber. I've only put a few hundred rounds through it. The wood is great looking, European walnut, and it is almost new in looks and bore. The specs are: 6 groove, 1:18 twist 34"" barrel. The overall length of the rifle is 50 7/8"" and it weighs 12.6 pounds. It has an adjustable set trigger which can give it a trigger pull of about 4 ounces.

I added a Pedersoli USA 426 front sight with spirit level, replaceable insert sights and replaceable glass levels. I also added a Pedersoli USA 406 Soule Long Range sight set with wooden case and a Hadley eyecup. I removed the original buckhorn sight but it is included along with the original front sight and a blade front sight. I have the boxes and manuals for the sights but not the orignal rifle box.

I'm including an unopened box of 100 pieces of Winchester brass plus whatever other brass I can find, so far 15.. I only fired black powder loads but this is a modern rifle so smokless, used properly can be used.

This is just too much for me with arthritis and eyes not what they were.

I'm going to keep it here for a few days before it goes to Gunbroker. Shipping is a pain.

So I'd like to see what I can possibly trade this for.
This rifle has 1100 in it, and the parts are worth more than that. So something of comparable value please. I will downtrade if you throw a little cash on it. I will cut a good deal though, I am not looking to get an exact match in value. Will throw in some extras, if needed.

I am specifically in the market for a new 9mm handgun. Sig P226 in 9mm(railed model), USP 9mm, and Beretta 92FS's all interest me. No taurus' please.
Lemme know what you got. Will trade down, and cut a good deal.

I will also take cash, if interested in buying it outright. If interested in just the upper, I will sell it complete for the right offer. 

If someone has a new or LNIB 92FS, I will trade my complete upper even for it, or cut a pretty good deal downtrading the rifle.

Components are as follows:
BCM upper, w/t marks and M4 feed ramps, 20'' chrome lined 1:7 twist barrel, Magpul BUIS, chrome bolt carrier group, BCM gunfighters charging handle, Knights Armament RAS handguard, DSA(DS arms) ZM4 lower, 5 position telescoping Vltor stock, and Magpul MOE pisol grip.

Not a mix-and-match AR-15 (Franken-AR), no taxes or FFL fees, no paperwork, price is out the door.  If you are looking for your first black rifle, or a new addition to the family this may well be it. 16"" chrome-moly barrel 1/9 twist, M-4 profiled barrel (complete with M203 cuts). Flat-topped for flexible optics/sights mounting. If you have never had an AR, they are excellent for target shooting (point blank out to 500ish meters), hunting (turkey, deer, etc), and home defense.

Asking 750 cash (and not willing to take an offer that starts with a ""6"" or less), and will take partial trades as well. Manufacturer's MSRP is around 880 as configured. Will include 2 USGI 30-round magazines. I also have a Rock River carry-handle and extra mag (around 100 extra value) I could throw in for the right offer.

I would prefer cash, but I understand the state of the economy right now (IE: Everybody, probably including you, wants cash also). Considering this, if you want this rifle more than something else you may have I will give you around 70%of average market value(including condition) on any trade you may have, in order to make this rifle easier for you to get.

Any offers (cash or trade), or any questions you may have: By all means feel free to contact me, and if you don't have/use e-mail just send a message with your number and I'll get back with you. Thank you for your time and interest.  Top picture shows a Rock River carry-handle, which can be included for an additional $50, and case for an additional $20."

features an aluminum quad-rail hand guard that is ideally suited for mounting tactical accessories. The stock is a hinged folding Swiss-style that is able to collapse for ease of transportation or use in tight quarters. This feature is made possible by a new stock interface into the trigger casing. The adjustable stock snaps and securely locks into a folded position with a length-of-pull that can be preset by the user.

Extreme conditions call for an extreme gun. And never before has a rifle this durable and rugged been introduced to the world of hunting. The cutting edge in rifle design, the Model 700 XCR (Xtreme Conditions Rifle) uses Remington's proprietary new TriNyteT Corrosion Control System to make the Model 700 XCR virtually impervious to even the most extreme conditions. The TriNyte System takes firearm protection further than it's ever been before by using proven corrosion-fighting materials and an innovative, state-of-the-art application process. The result is a finish that provides scratch and corrosion resistance far superior to stainless steel alone and better than any other gun on the market.
Designed for shooters by shooters, the Model 700 XCR is built for superior handling in adverse conditions. Its feature laden synthetic stock is not only stylish and comfortable, but a technological marvel. Features include an R3® recoil pad from LimbsaverT - the most effective recoil pad produced today - and patented rubber overmolding technology from Hogue® - a revolutionary technique incorporated into the grip and fore-end areas to provide the surest grip even in the slickest environments. The new standard in rugged durability, the Model 700 XCR Xtreme Conditions Rifle will have you delivering your appointed rounds while the others stay home.


This firearm is in Excellent Condition (99%), with no visible wear or tear. Rilfe has less than 60 rounds through it. 

The reason I am trading it is that I now have a Remington 700 Police in .308, and have no need for two bolt-actions. 

I am interested in trading for a .44 Remington Magnum calbier revolver, preferably with a barrel 6"" or longer, for hunting whitetails. Will also sell the rifle for $700 firm with all the extras. Thanks
