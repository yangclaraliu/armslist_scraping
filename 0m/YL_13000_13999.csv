Unlike common gas-operated guns whose fore-ends conceal operating rods, pistons, O-rings, valves and other moving parts, the inertia recoil system is primarily contained inside the receiver. The results? A trimmer fore-end, better balance, more reliable operation and the ability to fire everything from light target ammunition to the heaviest waterfowl loads without adjustments. And because propellant gas isn't vented from the barrel into the operating system, Inertia Driven® guns like the Model 2000 stay cleaner, even after hundreds of shots. Even under the toughest conditions, your new Model 2000 will keep on firing! Reliability, versatility and value are what you expect in a semi-automatic shotgun and no other semi-automatic in its price range even compares to the Model 2000. 


Used lightly for one season (10 hunts or so), looks just like new.  These are in stores for much more than I'm asking here ($450ish).  I have the box, documents, and chokes that came with it new.  Get ready for ducks and geese!"

Gun is registered in my name - can ship and transfer for $400 shipped.

I have a Daewoo DH40 that I've been thinking about trading off. I would LIKE to do a FTF in Arkansas - I really don't want to ship - but if the deal was really good - I would probably ship it.

I bought it years ago brand new in the box - unfired. I only recently took it out to the range and put a magazine through it. It's flawless - looks absolutely new - comes with the box, owners manual, both mags. Just checked gunbroker and there's not a single one for sale.

The gun has the tri-action... unique to Daewoo - check out the videos on youtube  to see how it works - it's sweet. Looks like a Smith - tight as heck and very accurate. I'm just thinking of sticking to 9mm and .45 - easier to stockpile !

If you have something to trade - let me know. I like pistols. 9mm and .45. Sigs, 1911's, XD's, M&P's, Glocks, nice .22 rifles, .22 pistols, rifles in .223, .308, high end optics, etc. 

Shoot me your offers no matter what it is.  I'm always checking my email.

This picture isn't of my gun but this is exactly what it looks like - just like new!

This shotgun has been shot 15 times with birdshot and 10 times with buckshot (for patterning; cylinder choke, patterned well).  It has been cleaned and lubricated as recommended after each range trip (just two), hopefully it shows (see photos and feel welcome to inspect it thoroughly).  The finish and furniture is in excellent condition as it is wiped down with a silicone cloth after oiling and stored in a dry safe.  The break action is still stiff from being practically brand new.

I'd like to keep it, but I had a baby earlier this month, and am selling this shotgun to raise 
some funds.  I'm hoping to find someone who is similarly interested in cowboy guns or needs a simple-to-operate home defense gun to give it a good home.

I am no expert, but I had a gunsmith look at this to see about putting a scope on it, and he said it was a Sweedish Mauser that had been heavily modified. For instance, it has been changed from cock on closed to cock on open, among other things. It is an older 30-06. It shoots great, looks great, and functions fine. I just want a scope on one, and I was told by the gunsmith that it would actually DEvalue this gun to drill and tap for scope mounts. It has the older sights with adjustment for windage and elevation. It is a really nice piece and would go great for someone who collects this type of thing. Ideally, I would like to trade this for or possibly towards another 30-06 that has a scope or at least provisions to easily put a scope on it. If I didn't trade straight up, I wouldn't be able to put a whole lot of boot with it, meaning I am NOT looking for a $1000 gold plated mantle piece or something. I am looking for something that doesn't mind or has even seen some use. I would sell it for $250 obo, but just to use the money to buy another 30-06.

The Stoeger Model 2000 is licensed to use Benelli's Inertia Driven® operating system - the heart of the world's most prestigious and reliable autoloaders. The Stoeger Model 2000 is Inertia Driven® with only two moving parts in the bolt: the bolt body and the rotating locking head. Simplicity ensures reliability and the Model 2000 is quickly gaining a reputation as the most reliable semi-automatic on the market in its price range.
Unlike common gas-operated guns whose fore-ends conceal operating rods, pistons, O-rings, valves and other moving parts, the inertia recoil system is primarily contained inside the receiver. The results? A trimmer fore-end, better balance, more reliable operation and the ability to fire everything from light target ammunition to the heaviest waterfowl loads without adjustments. And because propellant gas isn't vented from the barrel into the operating system, Inertia Driven® guns like the Model 2000 stay cleaner, even after hundreds of shots. Even under the toughest conditions, your new Model 2000 will keep on firing! Reliability, versatility and value are what you expect in a semi-automatic shotgun and no other semi-automatic in its price range even compares to the Model 2000."

I bought it new app 30 years ago. I used it that one season, MAYBE put 2 boxes of shells thru it then. Never ever used it again. It has one rust spot on the left side of the barrel that's 1/2 an inch long X 3/16ths wide about 6 inches in from the end. . Tried to show in pic. That happened while it was in a case the same year that I bought it new. Otherwise all bluing in great shape. Some very minor marking on/in clear coat.

350.00 cash or possible trades I may be interested in are a Mark III or a Walther P22 or a HD/tactical 12 Ga . {I have a DL and a P2C for a pistol trade.}

Want a larger caliber (.308+) AR-10 in trade or a good cash offer so I can purchase one. I prefer Armalite, but there are many great gun manufacturers here in the USA.

Upper: Colt 20-inch barrel 1:9 twist w/ bayonet lug. Barrel marked ""C MP Chrome Bore""; C for the manufacturer Colt, MP stamp means the barrel was magnafluxed and proofed, chrome bore and chamber. Bolt Carrier manufacturer stamp ""Shield (8 sided octagon) and SE""; Smith Enterprise.

Lower: PWA (Pac West Arms, Milan, Ill.; this was the early LMT company I believe and Rock River Arms bought out PWA. From everything that I have heard they are excellent lowers!) 5.56mm Commando. This is a forged lower not cast. Serial# 11174. (PWA post-ban have a year prefix in the serial number. The serial # cutoff was 35222 for preban status).

Standard two point sling.
Has a new AR-16 cleaning kit (Small Arms Maintenance Equipment Case 8465-00-781-9564).
A1 stock w/ butt storage compartment.
Have one USA 30 round AR-15 .223 magazine by O'Kay Industries, Inc., New Britain, Conn.

This AR is in great shape and supreme working order. I had it fully serviced (new parts, fired & cleaned) by a gunsmith at Anderson's Gun Repair Shop here in Springfield, MO before putting it up for sale; new extractor spring & gas tube (had a dent in the tube which slowed the gas pressure).  I also run some 40 rounds through it and cleaned it. It was flawless.

I've had this same rifle (but fully auto - M16) issued to me during the latter part of the Vietnam conflict. I hate to part with this, but with the times as they are now I would prefer a much larger caliber for home defense. Not worried about whether or not you can hunt with it.

Let me know what you have and I'll see if we can come to an agreement."

Asking $725 OBO for the whole package. FTF in Ohio only at the moment. I'm in Columbus, willing to drive about an hour to make the sale if need be.


ALSO - I've got 370 rounds of brand new, never reloaded Blazer Brass .40 ammo and 137 rounds of the non-reloadable Blazer .40 ammo. That's a little over 10 boxes total, asking only $80. Furthermore, if someone picks up the gun and ammo, I'll toss in 350 .40 casings that I've collected recently from my trips to the range. Not worth much, but might be useful to some.



Will consider all trades, with a strong favoritism for a Kimber Pro Carry, ARs, or any other 1911s. Can add cash either direction to balance trades!

Thanks for looking, happy shooting!"

This gun is used but in very good shape.  I'm very picky, so I tend to give more details than necessary to some but I just want to make sure both parties walk away happy.  Gun has been holstered and shows VERY SLIGHT wear on the slide.

Plug included to put in the hole when the 10 round clip is used.  It just pulls in and out - no tools required.  It is installed on the first picture.

I would like to get a third Generation -  Glock 22, so if you have any interest in trading just let me know.  I do ask that you email me with your phone number so we can get the details back and forth fairly quickly.

I live in Cabot, Arkansas and work in North Little Rock, Arkansas.  There is an indoor range just down the road from where I work, should you desire to fire this at the range.  Shoots like a dream.
