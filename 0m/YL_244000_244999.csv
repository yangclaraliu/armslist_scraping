History

In 1899, the Army and Navy placed orders with Smith and Wesson for two to three thousand Model 1889 Hand Ejector revolvers chambered for the M1892 .38 U.S. Service Cartridge (aka .38 Long Colt). With this order, the Hand Ejector Model 1889 became known as the .38 Military and Police model of 1899.[3] That same year, in response to reports from military sources serving in the Philippines on the relative ineffectiveness of the .38 (Long Colt) cartridge, Smith & Wesson began offering the Military & Police in a new chambering, the .38 S&W Special (aka .38 Special) — a slightly elongated version of the .38 Long Colt cartridge with increased bullet weight (158 grains) and increase in powder charge from eighteen to twenty-one grains of black powder.[4]"

Selling this Savage to fund another rifle build. This rifle has less than 100 rounds through it and shoots like a champ but with a Remington 22 CHeetah in the safe it is sort of redundant. It will easily shoot 1/2 MOA with Bitterroot Valley Ammunition Company 55 grain V-Max ammo and I will include 80 rounds with the rifle. This ammo can be ordered from Cheaper Than Dirt and is economical at 16.59 a box. It is also a great round to reload for.

Deer season is over and christmas is rapidly approaching and my finances are not doing so well. Bluntly put the company I work for is not giving out a christmas bonus this year (first time in 12 years) and I need money for christmas presents for my kids. I hate to sell it as this rifle is one accurate deer slaying machine, but it's keep the rifle and the kids don't get a christmas, or sell it now so the kids can still believe in santa...

Its a Thompson Venture bolt-action in the 25-06 caliber. I have a Nikon Prostaff 3-9x40 scope with the Bullet Drop Compensator (BDC) reticle mounted to it. Additionally it has a padded nylon web bone collector sling and also a padded bone collector soft carrying case. Also included is the thompson Bolt cable and lock for securing it (+2 keys).

I am prior military and take pride in a clean weapon so you can bet this rifle is kept immaculate. 16 shots is all thats been through it and I still have the remaining 4 Hornday Superformance 85gr rounds from the one and only box I initially purchased for sighting in the scope and deer season, if you want them. (15 rounds to sight it in and have some fun + 1 round for the buck I shot = 4 shells left)

I have a total of 685$ in it. 450$ for the rifle. 175$ for the scope. 25$ for the sling and 35$ for the case. Since it is now considered used I understand that means I can't sell it for what I bought it all for, so I am knocking the price down. I am asking 500$ cash (I have a gun shop offering 425$ so there isn't much room to negotiate). I have until December 13th to sell this or christmas is a bust this year so if your interested I can be reached at the below email:

Overall, it is in fair condition and has years of life left.

I would be including ONE 10 round factory magazine and I have some cash, 4x Mec-Gar 18 round magazines or perhaps another gun to even it out. Got a NAA Mini revolver and a 1942 Enfield No.4 Mk.I sporterized.

Only looking for a Sig P226 Elite model or similar. Big things I'm looking for are a beavertail and the newer E2 grips would be a big plus!

I might also just trade lower receivers if someone is willing."

It is in EXCELLET condition and truly stunning.  The walnut stock has beautiful grain.  The metal is finley blued and polished.  Engraving is crisp and clear.  This is a very clean piece...  superb craftsmanship, well cared for.  Barrel is 28"" with vent rib, modified choke. 
   These pics just can't capture its beauty.  Must see to appreciate.  
   The A-5 (Auto 5) was manufactured for nearly 100 years, but is no longer made.  It has been loved for generations of hunters and collectors.  
   The designer, John Browning, designed many guns and held patents on 128 of them.  These included the Colt 1911, Browning Hi Power, BAR, M2 50 cal machine gun, and many, many more.  Of all of these, he said the A-5 shotgun was his best effort. 
   Note: I originally thought this was a Japan made Browning, but ONLY the barrel is.  The rest is Belgiun, pre-1967, with round pistol grip bottom.  Likely, the Japan made barrel was put on this Belgiun gun to allow safe use of steel shot for waterfoul.  It is rated for this, and fine to use with steel shot.  Most Belgiun barrels are NOT.  
   I do have access to a vent rib Belgiun barrel in exchange for the Japan one (free).  Let me know, if interested.
   This is your chance to own a first class peice of American history, (one you can use).  You'll be proud to own it, and pass it down to your grandson."

These were only built from 1981-1987. This is a semi-automatic rifle, and is the deluxe model of the 742's/7400's. Gun is the BDL model, solid walnut stock and forearm, cheekpiece, iron sights, high rise see-thru scope mounts, and topped with a brand new Bushnell Trophy 4 X 12 X 40 scope, just sighted in. Gun is in (my estimate) 90-95% condition, and my estimates are usually conservative. This rifle functiond flawlessly. I have put approximately two boxes thru it since I got it with no jamming whatsoever. I really like this rifle, probably as nice a gun as I have ever owned, but I am having shoulder/neck problems and need something with less recoil. Would consider trades of equal value, trades plus cash, or multiple guns on trade. I will e-mail pics if you are interested, or you have something I am interested in.

The Swarovski Habicht is a 2.5-10x56mm and a work of art in itself. This Austrian made rifle scope is approx. 10yrs old and in flawless condition. Never dropped, crystal clear at all magnifiations and the 56mm light gathering objective removes those ""low light conditions"". I've looked online and i can't find anything comparable to this scope for less than $1,000.

Or are you looking for the absolute best way to keep your firearm concealed yet still quickly available? 
If the answer to either question is yes then, Crusader Tactical Systems is for you! 
CTS offers concealment carriers using your firearm so that you know it will fit securely, they are very low profile and fit tight against the body making them easy to conceal. CTS carriers are made from Kydex which is a rigid and incredibly durable material making one handed re-holstering easy.
The firearm is held in place by friction lock so there are no cumbersome snaps or straps to fumble with and no complex locking mechanisms to fail.
Several styles, colors and patterns to choose from, prices start at $35.00, additional charges for colors other than black, light bearing and fully covered holsters. 
Contact Todd at 601-Five Zero Two-3875 or email at 
CrusaderTacticalSystems@Gmail dot com 
Or you can order a Raven Concealment, Pay more and wait several months for the same quality. Your choice.

If the holster you need is not a Glock 9mm .357 or .40, with or without a Surefire TLR1 I can build it but I'll need you to bring the firearm with you so I can build it. These holsters are guarantied FOREVER against manufacturing defects. 

The pics below are of past builds that have sold. I will make your holster when contacted and an agreement is reached.

I purchased this knife new, about eight years ago, while stationed in Italy.  This knife accompanied me when my brigade parachuted into northern Iraq in March of 2003 and spent my first tour serving me well. It later deployed with me, to Afghanistan in 2005. It has obvious wear marks along the blade, mostly from dust inside the scabbard and actual use, but it is otherwise in excellent condition.

This knife is no longer in production at Extrema Ratio and was one of their first product lines several year ago.  It is an agressive design, best suited for fighting and intimidation.  Extrema Ratio is one of the premier knife makers in Italy, with several contracts with Italian and European militaries for knives.

 Overall length is about 13.5 inches, with the blade comprising 8.5 inches; the handle 5.  Knife is surprisingly light for a large-bladed weapon and handles very well.

  Knife comes with its original scabbard, which can be configured for a drop-leg set-up.  Scabbard features positive retention, along with a ruggedized ""velcro""-type material on the knife handle which meshes with the retention snaps on the scabbard for absolute positive retention.

  It pains me to part with this knife, due to sentimental reasons, but times are hard and I could use the cash.  I originally paid 250 Euros for this knife and feel the asking price of $150 is more than fair, especially considering the knife's combat history.

This is a made-in-Belgium by FN and assembled-in-Portugal Browning BAR in 30-06 with class-1 wood upgrade.  (I'm not sure the pictures do the wood justice.)  It has a Nikon Pro-staff 3-9 riflescope on it.  I'm not a very good shot and can put three bullets into a 2"" circle at 200 yards.  Which probably means the gun is way more accurate than that.

The gun is in 99.9% condition.  I'm sure there is something wrong with it, but I don't see it.  It has never been taken into the field.  I loved this gun but couldn't see it in a tree stand.  The guy I bought it from shot four rounds out of it - I know this because he shipped me his two partially used ammo.  I've still got the boxes left so we're still under 40 rounds lifetime.

Of all the guns I'm selling this is hardest - it was the first long gun I bought as an adult.   I am cleaning out my gunroom and selling stuff I don't fire, so I will entertain reasonable offers, but cash only, no trades. I am not trying to just move the pieces around.

Remingtons specs

The most dependable slide action of all time in three advanced designs that will go the distance with deadly precision, whether your target is the crease behind a buck’s shoulder or a big red head. We’ve built the industry’s finest rifled slug guns for years, but our new 12-gauge Model 870™ SPS™ ShurShot™ Synthetic Super Slug advances deer-leveling technology to farther reaches and smaller group sizes than ever before possible. Even more so when paired with high-performance ammunition like our Premier AccuTip sabot slugs.

Because barrel stability is key to extended-range accuracy, this shotgun’s barrel is of extra-heavy, 1"" diameter configuration and measures a full 25 1/2"". It’s also pinned to the receiver to control vibration for rifle-like, shot-to-shot consistency. Five longitudinal flutes keep weight and heat buildup to a minimum while bolstering barrel rigidity. Six Parabolic Ultragon™ rifling grooves with a 1-in-35"" twist optimize slug flight. But much more than just the ultimate accuracy-enhancing barrel design, this shotgun provides the rock-steady aim and outstanding pointability of our ambidextrous ShurShot pistol-grip synthetic stock. Rubberized overmolding at the pistol grip and extended fore-end offer a sure hold in adverse conditions. For unmatched shooting comfort, we added the SuperCell™ recoil pad. The receiver is drilled and tapped, and the included Weaver rail makes adding optics a cinch. Sling swivel studs are built in.
Key Features:

    25 1/2"" extra-heavy, 1""-diameter barrel with longitudinal flutes for reduced weight
    Barrel is pinned to the receiver for the utmost in shot-to-shot stability
    Parabolic Ultragon™ rifling with a 1:35"" twist

If you are looking for a collector’s piece, this rifle has a lot of appeal. The stamp on the receiver says 1916. I am not an expert on these rifles but I assume that that means this rifle is about 95 years old and could have been used in WWI. It is about 51 inches from butt to muzzle (not the carbine!), and it has the hex receiver.  If you are looking for a reliable weapon, this is probably not it. While I have fired this rifle, it is not in fully operational order. The bolt sticks after firing and is difficult to open. I have not fired the rifle in some time as I have doubts as to its safety due to its age and tendency to malfunction. Wish the guy who sold it to me would have mentioned that. I do have some ammunition to go with it if you know how to fix the problem or have another rifle in the same caliber. There are 40 rounds of sp and 52 rounds of fmj from various manufacturers.

FFLs and Law Enforcement Agencies, however, may take any number of additional CZ-85s at the same per-pistol price, and with no additional shipping charges. From the early days of a free Czech Republic, here is a specimen of Czech gunsmithy’s handiwork, their CZ-85 pistol. CZ ruled the Wonder Nine days of the 1970s and 1980s, as far as steel frame pistols went. Czech engineers took John M. Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power design, strengthened it, and developed a smooth and accurate masterpiece in double action. Their CZ-85 has ambidextrous safety, ambidextrous slide stop, full chrome barrel, serrated trigger guard, and overtravel stop on the back of its trigger. Photos show 5 different specimens from the issue weapons of the Municipal Police of Ostrava, Czech Republic, where this pistol protected a flourishing population in their industrious city. Year code is stamped above the extractor, 1991. The CZ-85 is a traditional double- and single action auto with a main safety that allows cocked-and-locked carry. This pistol does not have a firing pin block or safety, so its single action trigger pull is crisper than most. The .227 wide serrated spur hammer has a half cock position for safety-off double action carry. Slide is serrated rear for easy operation; and its 4.7 inch barrel with double cam slide lock matches its Browning ancestor. Chrome finished smooth face .315 combat trigger yields a smooth, consistent double action trigger pull of 7/8 inch distance; single action trigger travel measures about 1/3 inch with minimal felt creep. Specimens we have gauged pull at 4 pound vicinity on single action. Sights are stake-on serrated ramp front with dovetailed, well protected dot configuration rear fixed sight both mounted on a heat-dissipating serrated rib atop the slide.  Construction is entirely steel, with a semi-gloss black Polycoat finish similar to the Mark II Browning Hi-Powers. Grips are issue CZ logo black polymer. Ease of disassembly and reassembly exceeds all other pistols on the market even today, with hash marks on the disassembly position for easy removal of the slide stop / barrel link pin; disassembly yields grip frame, barrel, guide rod and spring. Weight empty is 35 ounces. Surface detractions on this pistol is only moderate, edge whitening and moderate contact surface wear to the grip frame backstrap and moderate toning to the white steel barrel surface. We classify it as Very Good, 80 percent vicinity; photos should suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our grading, the pistol buyer will receive will be substantially identical and from the same Department trade. Left side of slide is marked with the importer’s stamp, PW Arms Redmond WA, as required by US Law; and then the CZ logo and Model 85 cal. 9 Luger, with Made in Czechoslovakia on the left side of the frame. These fine pistols are well maintained by their Ostrava officers; and they are excellent mechanically; bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent. The CZ 85 pistols will digest any ammunition, from lead bullet reloads to steel case Russian to the finest Federal Hydra-Shok sharp-nosed hollowpoints. That is something one cannot say about competitors Glock and HK, to name a couple. Another strong suite is their slides mate precisely to the frames, full steel-rail-to-steel-rail contact, not with a slide resting on four small runners like their Austrian competitors. This is a real pistol, not a piece of plastic. It comes with an original issue steel 15 shot magazine, and in a factory box.

Photos show one out of several dozen Glock 17 Service Pistols.  This listing is for One Glock 17; FFLs and Police Departments, however, may take any number of substantially identical pistols at the same per-gun price and with no additional shipping charges. Here is what Glock says about the 17. The Glock 17 in caliber 9x19 is the most widely used law enforcement pistol worldwide. Because of its unsurpassed reliability, magazine capacity of 17 + 1 and its low weight, it is trusted by law enforcement officers in their daily duties throughout the world. It is safe, easy and quick to use through the revolutionary Safe Action trigger system. Factory specs are double action only semi-auto pistol; caliber 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm; barrel length 4.02 inches; magazine capacity 17+1; trigger safety and firing pin block; polymer grip frame; issue factory night sights; weight empty 23 ounces; black high impact polymer frame with black matte slide and furniture. Trigger is 8 pound pull, striker fired, double action only. This Second Generation Glock 17 specimen comes to us from a decade of service with Florida’s premiere Police Department, Tampa PD.  From their BLP, BMR, BMS, BTD, and BUA Serial number prefixes, they were manufactured in 1996. Surface detractions are only moderate, principally edge whitening on the slide and buffing and scouring on the grip frame. Anyway, Glocks have been pretty impervious to wear. We rate them as Very Good, 80 percent vicinity by our estimate; and we have individual pistols’ photos linked to our home page robertsontradingpost com. From our darkroom inspection, the night sights retain 50 to 60 percent of their original luminosity. The warranty is long expired on the night sights, and weak or dead night sights is not a basis for a return or adjustment. These Glock 17s are certainly well maintained and excellent mechanically; bore, chamber, and mechanism are bright, clean, and excellent.

This weapon served and protected our Swiss friends in the Northwest Region of their country, Canton Solothurn, with that subdivision’s counterpart to our State Police. The Solothurn Shield is neatly engraved atop the slide near the rear sights. This 228 is not date coded, but from its B330000 range serial number, it was manufactured in 2005. It is thoroughly German, and serialized on its frame, slide, and barrel. Its only U.S. marking is PW Arms import stamp on the right side of the slide, as the photos show.  This is standard traditional double action: from a resting hammer, a long double action pull on the first shot, and then single action until the shooter engages the decocker. This pistol, like all modern Sigs, has a firing pin safety. What the factory says, emphasizes what we know of the world’s best brand of pistol: A single action or double action pistol, the P228 has a magazine capacity of 13 rounds. It has the automatic firing pin safety system used on previous Sig Sauer pistols, and the magazine catch can be mounted on the left or right side to suit the operator's preference. The magazine floorplate, made of high impact synthetics, gives the magazine a considerable degree of protection against damage caused by dropping. An essentially closed design concept renders the P228 particularly resistant to dust and dirt. Here is what we say: the 228 and its 229 counterpart are the best quality 9mm Compact pistols on the market, emphasis on best more than on Compact. They are the smallest variant double-stacked magazine capable descendants of the definitive P226, the P-228 with semi-gloss K-Kote finish slide and matching lightweight alloy frame. Barrel is 3.9 inches 6 groove 1:10 rifling; weight empty is 26.1 oz; length 6.9 inches; height 5 1/4 inches; maximum width 1.5 inches; 5.5 inch sight radius; 10 pound double action trigger pull; and Sig's classic crisp single action pull at 4 1/2 pound vicinity, with negligible felt creep. Capacity is 13+1 rounds, and we are furnishing this pistol with two factory 13 Round 228 Magazines. Sights are orginal Factory Night Sights, and we rate their luminosity at 60 percent of original strength from our darkroom inspection. Finish is highly durable K Kote, so Surface detractions are minimal, with faint small amounts of white along some of the upper slide edges. Grips are original issue, with moderate toning to the grip screws. We rate it as Very Good, close to Excellent, 85 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. It is certainly Excellent mechanically; the Swiss Police are among the best worldwide for weapons maintenance. It comes in a hard case with Cable Lock, and Factory German / French Instruction Manual. Replacement price on these in our area, if a person can even find one, is upwards of $1,000.00. We're offering the exact Sig P228 in the photos	for only	$ 569.00.

This weapon served and protected our Swiss friends in the Northwest Region of their country, Canton Solothurn, with that subdivision’s counterpart to our State Police. Slide bears the Solothurn Shield. From its KH Date Code, it was manufactured in 1997; and this pistol is thoroughly German, and serialized on its frame, slide, and barrel. Its only U.S. marking is PW Arms import stamp on the right side of the slide, as the photos show.  This is standard traditional double action: from a resting hammer, a long double action pull on the first shot, and then single action until the shooter engages the decocker. This pistol, like all modern Sigs, has a firing pin safety. What the factory says, emphasizes what we know of the world’s best brand of pistol: A single action or double action pistol, the P228 has a magazine capacity of 13 rounds. It has the automatic firing pin safety system used on previous Sig Sauer pistols, and the magazine catch can be mounted on the left or right side to suit the operator's preference.

An essentially closed design concept renders the P228 particularly resistant to dust and dirt. Here is what we say: the 228 and its 229 counterpart are the best quality 9mm Compact pistols on the market, emphasis on best more than on Compact. They are the smallest variant double-stacked magazine capable descendants of the definitive P226, the P-228 with matte blue slide, and matte anodized lightweight alloy frame.

Capacity is 13+1 rounds, and this pistol is furnished with one original Swiss Police issue 13 round Sig factory magazine. Sights are issue 3 dot configuration, night sights but with only faint remaining luminosity. Surface detractions come from holster contact, principally on the slide area with moderate surface whitening.

This weapon served and protected our Swiss friends in the Northwest Region of their country, Canton Solothurn, with that subdivision’s counterpart to our State Police. The Solothurn Shield adorns the forward left side of the slide on this specimen. From its KB Date Code, it was manufactured in 1991; and this pistol is thoroughly German, and serialized on its frame, slide, and barrel. Its only U.S. marking is PW Arms import stamp on the right side of the slide, as the photos show.  This is standard traditional double action: from a resting hammer, a long double action pull on the first shot, and then single action until the shooter engages the decocker. This pistol, like all modern Sigs, has a firing pin safety. What the factory says, emphasizes what we know of the world’s best brand of pistol: A single action or double action pistol, the P228 has a magazine capacity of 13 rounds. It has the automatic firing pin safety system used on previous Sig Sauer pistols, and the magazine catch can be mounted on the left or right side to suit the operator's preference. The magazine floorplate, made of high impact synthetics, gives the magazine a considerable degree of protection against damage caused by dropping. An essentially closed design concept renders the P228 particularly resistant to dust and dirt. Here is what we say: the 228 and its 229 counterpart are the best quality 9mm Compact pistols on the market, emphasis on best more than on Compact.

Capacity is 13+1 rounds, and this pistol is furnished with one original Swiss Police issue 13 round Sig factory magazine. Sights are issue 3 dot configuration, night sights but with only faint remaining luminosity. Surface detractions come from holster contact, principally on the slide area with moderate to extensive surface whitening.

http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/p250-compact-digital-camo.aspx

This model is more expensive because it is digital camo and has night sights.  The MSRP on it is $855.  I know they have some of the other models going for less, but this isn't the plain black.  I bought this gun new, I have NOT fired ANY rounds through it.  It is still brand new as it came from the factory.  The pictures I post are of the actual firearm.  The handgun comes with original box, two (2) 15 round magazines, and everything that came in original box.

I will consider all respectable bids.  Please do not email me unless you are serious.  This is a great pistol, I don't need any more 9mm's which is why I am selling this one.  I searched for this pistol, and most of the online company's were out, and I'm not sure Sig is making the Digital Camo version anymore (but I can't verify).  FTF only.

This weapon served and protected our Swiss friends in the Northwest Region of their country, Canton Solothurn, with that subdivision’s counterpart to our State Police. The Solothurn Shield adorns the forward left side of the slide on this specimen. From its KC Date Code, it was manufactured in 1992; and this pistol is thoroughly German, and serialized on its frame, slide, and barrel. Its only U.S. marking is PW Arms import stamp on the right side of the slide, as the photos show.  This is standard traditional double action: from a resting hammer, a long double action pull on the first shot, and then single action until the shooter engages the decocker. This pistol, like all modern Sigs, has a firing pin safety. What the factory says, emphasizes what we know of the world’s best brand of pistol: A single action or double action pistol, the P228 has a magazine capacity of 13 rounds. It has the automatic firing pin safety system used on previous Sig Sauer pistols, and the magazine catch can be mounted on the left or right side to suit the operator's preference. The magazine floorplate, made of high impact synthetics, gives the magazine a considerable degree of protection against damage caused by dropping. An essentially closed design concept renders the P228 particularly resistant to dust and dirt. Here is what we say: the 228 and its 229 counterpart are the best quality 9mm Compact pistols on the market, emphasis on best more than on Compact. They are the smallest variant double-stacked magazine capable descendants of the definitive P226, the P-228 with matte blue slide, and matte anodized lightweight alloy frame. Barrel is 3.9 inches 6 groove 1:10 rifling; weight empty is 26.1 oz; length 6.9 inches; height 5 1/4 inches; maximum width 1.5 inches; 5.5 inch sight radius; 10 pound double action trigger pull; and Sig's classic crisp single action pull at 4 1/2 pound vicinity, with negligible felt creep. Capacity is 13+1 rounds, and this pistol is furnished with one original Swiss Police issue 13 round Sig factory magazine. Sights are issue 3 dot configuration, night sights but with only faint remaining luminosity. Surface detractions come from holster contact, principally on the slide area with only moderate surface whitening. Grips are Police issue, as the photos show, with moderate to extensive scouring mostly on the right panel and back area, with moderate toning or whitening to the grip screws. We rate it as Very Good, 80 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. It is certainly Excellent mechanically; the Swiss Police are among the best worldwide for weapons maintenance. Replacement price on these in our area, if a person can even find one, is upwards of $1,000.00. We're offering the exact Sig P228 in the photos	for only	$ 489.00.

Barrel is 3.9 inches 6 groove 1:10 rifling; weight empty is 26.1 oz; length 6.9 inches; height 5 1/4 inches; maximum width 1.5 inches; 5.5 inch sight radius; 10 pound double action trigger pull; and Sig's classic crisp single action pull at 4 1/2 pound vicinity, with negligible felt creep. Capacity is 13+1 rounds, and this pistol is furnished with one original Swiss Police issue 13 round Sig factory magazine. Sights are issue 3 dot configuration, night sights but with only faint remaining luminosity. Surface detractions come from holster contact, principally on the slide area with moderate to extensive surface whitening. Grips are Police issue, as the photos show, with moderate to extensive scouring mostly on the right panel and back area, with moderate toning or whitening to the grip screws. We rate it as Good, perhaps Very Good, 75 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. It is certainly Excellent mechanically; the Swiss Police are among the best worldwide for weapons maintenance. Replacement price on these in our area, if a person can even find one, is upwards of $1,000.00. We're offering the exact Sig P228 in the photos	for only	$ 469.00.		Transferable to civilians in all jurisdictions of the United States.

Restrictions apply in some jurisdictions, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding. This pistol shows Taurus innovation and German influence at the same time. Taurus began building credible, quality descendants of the Beretta 92 series in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the Brazilian Company deftly combined tradition with innovation beginning with its early models. The 92 and 99 series pistols filled a pricing niche beneath the pricey Berettas with no sacrifice of quality. After Beretta introduced its 92SB Compact, Taurus followed suit with their 92 C, which led to the series that includes the photo specimen in the late 1990s, when Taurus took its Beretta Compact type frame and installed a shorter, sturdier slide with looks akin to the German Sig Pistols. Here is Taurus’s PT-911 Stainless, with a straighter, thinner grip frame on the order of Beretta’s Vertec frames for shooters more comfortable with a pared-down grip frame compared to the relatively fat feeling 92 variants. Type is traditional double and single action semi-automatic; construction is stainless steel barrel, slide and parts mounted on a polished alloy frame; grip frame is traditional and serrated fore and aft. Frame is equipped with an integral Picatinny or Weaver type rail for optical, laser and light accessories. Magazine capacity is 15 rounds, 15+1 total capacity. Barrel length is 4 inches according to the box label and also according to the California Department of Justice, but 3 3/4 inches by our own fallible measurement. This pistol comes furnished with two blue steel finger rest floorplate Taurus factory magazines; and any Taurus 92/99 magazine will fit into this pistol with some protrusion. Ambidextrous Frame Mounted Safety levers also serve as decockers, to safely return the hammer to its resting, double-action-ready position. The pistol, like all Tauruses with frame mounted safeties, is also capable of cocked-and-locked, single-action-first-shot carry. Current replacement pricing on the PT 911 is upwards of $500 per unit in our area, if a person can even find one. We’re offering the PT-911 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, to its first best bidder on this fine electronic venue. 	Not transferable to civilians in Massachusetts.

Taurus began building credible, quality descendants of the Beretta 92 series in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the Brazilian Company deftly combined tradition with innovation beginning with its early models. Here is a pistol that combines Beretta Ergonomics with German styling influence to yield Latin America’s premiere defensive and military handgun chambered in the power house .38 Super caliber. Type is traditional double and single action semi-automatic; construction is stainless steel barrel, slide and parts mounted on a polished alloy frame; grip frame is traditional and serrated fore and aft. Frame is equipped with an integral Picatinny or Weaver type rail for optical, laser and light accessories. The straight line blue steel magazine
s capacity is 10 rounds, 10+1 total capacity, of .38 ACP or .38 Super Ammunition interchangeably. A person does not need a high capacity pistol with this caliber; it is the ballistic equivalent of a .357 Magnum. Barrel length is 4 inches according to the box label, but a Commander-close 4 1/8 inches by our own fallible measurement. This pistol comes furnished with two blue steel finger rest floorplate Taurus factory magazines, and extra magazines are widely available and legal in all jurisdictions of the United States. Ambidextrous Frame Mounted Safety levers also serve as decockers, to safely return the hammer to its resting, double-action-ready position. The pistol, like all Tauruses with frame mounted safeties, is also capable of cocked-and-locked, single-action-first-shot carry. Current replacement pricing on the PT 38S is upwards of $600 per unit in our area, if a person can even find one. We’re offering the PT-38S in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for only	$ 429.00 .	Not transferable to civilians in California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts.
