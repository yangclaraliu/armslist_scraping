I now have two spikes tactical lower parts kits in as well. ($400.00) If you would like me to assemble your lower receiver I do this as a hobby on the side so there is no charge but you will have to purchase kit as well.

*DIGITAL ACU SOFT SHELL CASE
*TWO MAGPUL PMAGS

Don't want the Lancer mags? No problem, take $100 off.


The L5AWM is the only HYBRID AR magazine available today, featuring the best characteristics of Polymer and Steel magazine designs. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.

The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few.

When I bought the pistol, it did not fire reliably; so I disassembled it, thoroughly cleaned it, and replaced the firing pin, main spring and recoil spring while I had it disassembled.
The firing problem was just a very dirty firing pin channel (probably never cleaned), but I replaced the firing pin anyway since I had a new one.
Upgraded the recoil spring to a 19lb Extra Power Wolff spring as recommended at the time by Makarov.com.
Original plastic grips have been replaced with very comfortable Pearce Rubber grips.
Operates perfectly since reassembly. About 300 rounds through it with no problems using inexpensive Russian factory ammo.

Makarov Variant Shootoff 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etZYLLhLGdg

The Pistolet Makarova was designed by Russian: Nikolai Federovich Makarov. The design was for a simple and reliable, medium-power pistol to be used as the sidearm of the Soviet Forces. Accepted by the Russian military in 1951, it became the Soviet Union's standard military side arm from 1951-1991. As of 2012, large numbers of Makarov PMs are still in Russian military and police service; and the Makarov is still the service pistol of many Eastern European and former Soviet republics. China, North Korea and Vietnam also use Makarov PMs as standard-issue pistols.

The 5 countries that produced the Makarov:
    Russia - home of Nikolai Federovich Makarov
    East Germany - The Ernst Thaelman Factory
    China
    Bulgaria - The Arsenal Factory and Miltex
    Germany (post-unification) - The Simson Suhl

The Ernst Thaelman factory in Suhl,Thueringen made what are generally considered the finest Makarovs produced before the Berlin wall fell. The finish is nicely blued, with the high quality fit and machining you would expect from German craftmanship, and they are great shooters with a very good trigger. Most imported into this country were former service pistols, so their condition varies; but most have more holster wear than bore wear. If you want a nice shooter, the East German are the ones to buy."

It uses standard 1911 mags, I've got a few extra of the expensive custom mags if you want to pay a little more.

Looking to trade to a Glock 19, 30, or 36 Gen 3.  My guns used and your gun will be used of course, but new dealer cost of the Titan is $19.95 more than the Glock 19 (not including the hogue grip or spring) and the Titan is $21.01 less that the 30 or 36 (not including the grip or spring).

This gun is new at Budsgunshop.com (which has about the best prices you will find) cash price of $503 (don't think you will drive to KY for a few bucks) or credit/debit of $518 plus shipping and FFL fees.  I'm asking $450 for an excellent shape used one with about $50 in accessories.
Sale price for the Titan is $450 with grip and spring included (and in case your wondering $450 is below dealer cost on the Titan).  I paid $29.99 for the grip and I think $20 for the spring.

UPDATE:  Yes, Buds does have an ATI 1911 for $399, but it is not my model, its a full size, no bull barrel, and doesnt come with the extras im offering......so if your comp shopping before you email me saying im ripping people off compare apples to apples."

411,http://www.armslist.com/posts/817411,For Sale/Trade:  1960 Thompson Sea-Lancer 17' Vintage Wooden Boat for sale or trade,"Amelia, Ohio, Cincinnati, Ohio","$ 6,200","Listed On: Tuesday, January 8, 2013",Fishing,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have decided it's time to sell my 1960 Thompson Sea-Lancer Runabout. I will consider trading for hand guns and/or high powered rifles. Make me an offer. I am ready to sell. This boat has been restored & maintained and in my opinion is in very good condition. I purchased the it partially restored from the third owner. It was given to him by his father in law who purchased it from the original owner. This is the original package as it was when it rolled off the dealers showroom floor 52 years ago. The hull was built by Thompson Bros. Boat Mfg. in Peshtigo, WI. in late 1960 and sold to a dealership in Chicago in early 1961. The dealership then fitted it with the motor and assigned a trailer. The motor is a 1961 Evinrude Starflite III with the 20 amp unicharger. Everything works. This motor was state of the art in 1961. In fact, this exact model was used in March of 1960 to set the world speed record on Lake Havasu of 114.6 miles per hour. This motor has been completely gone through and runs like a top. The cylinders have all been honed out and fitted with brand new piston rings. We installed a brand new impeller and replaced every single gasket from top to bottom end. There were a few dings on the hood that we fixed, too. The trailer is a 1961 Tee Nee OB-1300A tilt trailer made in Youngstown, Ohio. I repainted it from ground up with a slightly brighter yellow than Tee Nee used. I just thought this brighter shade made the trailer pop. It still has the original tear drop fenders and believe it or not, the tilt still works perfectly. As far as extra are concerned, we bought about $3000.00 in new custom cushions and custom canvas. The original boats in those days did not have cushions. Just nice comfortable hard wood benches. We had to upgrade that. We also installed a stereo system with 4 speaker strategically mounted so not to damage or even modify the original structure. We also installed new marine grade carpet on all the floordecking. The inside of the hull is sealed. Since we bought the boat it has always been in stored hanging in a garage during the winter months. We generally pull the motor off in October and store it on a motor stand in a heated work shop after winterizing it. All of the accessories that I have will go with the boat. Including a spare motor if you want it. It is in pieces, but the buyer is welcome to it. Also, included will be 6 life jackets, a knee board, a set of original Thompson Bros. wooden combo skis, 2 metal gas cans, 1 plastic gas can, manual for the motor, parts list for the motor, ski ropes, first aid kit, fire ex.,new wooden oars, 1 spare prop w/hardware, a 10 lbs. anchor, a Thompson Bros. flag and anything else I can find that goes with it.

Heard ammo is scarce and going for a buck a round. WOW,  I will throw in 3- 20 round boxes of wolf to fill the mags. After all, without ammo, the only way it is an assault weapon is if you smack somebody upside the head with it, LOL. then its an assault and battery weapon

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Good bore and very little usage on the gun it is in excellent shape. It's been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon reasonable time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not really interested in Shipping a gun anywhere but like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will just keep the item.

Trades:

The only trade I might be interested in is an STI or Unfired Remington 700 .308 5-R. Of course I will add cash as needed. The only other trade I am currently interested in is a trade for cash (preferably US currency but I'll take Euros also). I am not interested in any ""scrimps"" or any others seafood. Heck, I'm not interested in any food for that matter. I seem to think it will all have an aftertaste of BS. 

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special, I will assume you are a fucking retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. I am not a used car sales man who is amazed that somebody has cash for a purchase. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gun(whatever site) is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."

Still has the pink sticker on the side.  Shot this at the range once and zero misfires, fail to feeds, or light strikes and shot perfect the 50 rounds I put through it.  This includes everything that came with it.  Box, case, keys wrenches, lock, 1 magazine, lasermax laser and the LC9 gun.  This gun is as good as new.  The only thing I can tell you about this one is compared to a new one is that the first 50 rounds went flawless.  I personally did not like the fit of the gun in my hand after shooting it at the range and am so used to a single action.   I will not split up the lasermax laser from the LC9.  Here is a link to the Ruger webpage for the LC9.  It has a retail of 529.00 I am not saying it sells for that much.  No gun should sell for the retail unless you are buying from overpriced Gandermountain.  Right now the lowest price for this gun is 400.00 plus shipping and ffl fee if you search nationally.  Will consider trades for a 40 cal or a 9mm a little larger with a retail value of 529.00 Again I am not saying it needed to cost you that much just the retail value be that much.  Interested In SR40C. They sell all day for 400 to 425 new.  So if you have one you have used a little I still would be interested. Send me trade offers or first 385 can take it.  I am firm on 385.  I honestly would rather make a trade, if a fair trade.  ID over 21 and preferably a CCH holder but not necessary.

No Chinese junk here!  

The Good:  This is a powerful battle rifle in .308 that is a US made clone of the German G3 military rifle.  It comes with (4) 20 round magazines and the great news is that buying more magazines is cheep and easy.  Of all the military rifles in civilian use (AR-15, M1A, Mini-14, etc.) the G3/CETME/FA91 mags are by FAR the cheapest.  If you are a prepper and want 60 fully loaded mags in your basement this is an ideal way to go.  At 400 yards and in, it is as good as any rack military rifle (that is not one that has hundreds of dollars of gun smithing work or more).  If you are not  familiar with shooting, 400 yards is long shoot and is the outer limits of range with any rifle for the average citizen that does not practice by shooting 800 to 1000 rounds per year.

The Bad:  No, you are not going to go to Camp Perry and win the 1000 yard service rifle competition this August with this rifle.  You will need a $4,000+ rifle and the time and money for lots of practice for that.  Also, the G3's are notorious for hard charging (pulling the bolt back to make the rifle ready to fire the first round).  Every five to ten thousand thousand rounds, you will need to check the head spacing as is the case will pretty much all G3/CETME/FA91 designs.  

About the Seller:  I am a licensed attorney and long time advocate of gun rights.  We have a right from God to self defense.  The Constitution of the United States and that of Ohio provides political protection and recognition of these rights.  The second amendment has nothing to do with hunting, it is there to protect us from the number 1 mass murderer in all of history - tyrannical government.  Thus, every responsible family leader really should have at least one decent military rifle.  

Terms of sale:  All transactions will take place face to face in my law office in Delaware, Ohio.  You must be a resident of Ohio and not have any prohibition limiting your ability to purchase and own this rifle. Valid driver's license is required, valid Concealed Carry license preferred.  I do not make copies of this information as I will respect your privacy.  Credit Card transactions are subject to a 3% additional charge (this is a pass along cost)."

Smoothest Trigger you'll ever feel.Bolt is exceptionally smooth and very easy to operate.These guns are very difficult to obtain and hard to find.Gun is in great condition and is definately a great target/hunting gun.

I'm asking $550 cash or am open to trades. (AR-15 stuff,AK stuff,just let me know)

The factory trigger assembly was replaced with the Red Star Arms fire control group which includes an adjustable trigger - the user can adjust it - and a properly configured hammer for the SAR-3. The factory hammer was known to cause uneven wear on the bolt in these rifles and they also suffered from trigger slap, so this is and incredibly important upgrade on the SAR3. The original FSB was replaced with an original Romanian threaded 22mm front sight base and a US-made copy of the Romanian muzzlebrake by AK-USA. All parts were installed by Troy at InRange in Kodak, Tennessee. Troy installed everything and then parkerized and painted the rifle. I don't think anyone interested in AKs can question the high quality of Troy's work. The finish is smooth, even, and looks phenomenal, especially compared to other AKs. The muzzlebrake and FSB are fully functional as designed (plunger and spring to lock the brake in place upon tightening) and the muzzlebrake is fully removable. The furniture is laminated wood from Russia with the exception of the laminated repo handgrip which is US made. The furniture was professionally refinished with an authentic Russian look, Includes two 30 round waffle mags.

This is fitted with a Hogue pistol grip, but also has original full length stock. It has an extended tube on it to fit 7 in the mag, +8th in the chamber. Tri-picatinny rail just forward of the pump is ideal for mounting light, laser, or any other accessory on. Finish is a rare Remington ceramicoat that is a gray textured look. The choke is a door breacher (designed to be pressed against hinge or latch points on a door and fired) The prongs make it stick in place as you pull the trigger, and the large holes at the sides allow the charge to blow the hinges or latches out without over pressuring the barrel. Sling is a bungee single point on a QD swivel. The swivel is incorporated into the 6 round side saddle, or you can attach the sling right to the ring on the pistol grip. the pistol grip is Hogue's most shock absorbing design and really tames the kick of this gun. It is a 3 inch mag, which means you can load 2.75 or 3 inch shells in it. I am including a trove of extra ammo. Bunch of one 0 buck and, double 0 buck, as well as some slugs. Both 2.75 as well as 3 inch lengths. For close to medium range this gun is a perfect weapon. I will require a bill of sale stating you can legally own the weapon, as well as ID.
