It is a stainless steel frame and slide double-action, semi-automatic handgun with 4 inch barrel, slide mounted de-cock/safety and an 11-round staggered-column magazine. It was one of the new 3rd generation S&W semi-autos, designed with input from famed gunsmith Wayne Novak of Parkersburg, WV. The 4006 introduced the new .40 S&W cartridge and featured a wrap around one piece grip made of Xenoy versus the earlier standard 2 piece grip panels, as well as low profile 3 dot Novak sights. A lightweight aluminum alloy framed S&W 4003 was also produced that weighed 800 grams (29 ounces) and was more comfortable to carry. The 4046 model was a DAO (double action only) pistol. The 4046 also had a lightweight analog in the 4043 model. The first 2 digits in the model number indicate caliber. The last digit either a 3 or 6 indicate aluminum or stainless steel frame respectively. Various safety features include a safety lever, which blocked the firing pin from the hammer as well as a magazine safety, which kept the pistol from firing when no magazine was inserted. While a true double-action pistol, the firearm shares this magazine disconnect feature with Browning Hi-Power pistols: it cannot be fired without the magazine in place. This feature was developed to meet the needs of various law enforcement agencies interested in providing another level of safety for their officers.

The Model 4006 has been used by many law enforcement agencies as a standard duty sidearm, including by the California Highway Patrol , California State Parks and Rec., and until recently, the Colorado State Patrol. As of September 2009 both the California State Parks and Rec. Department and the Colorado State Patrol have both retired the venerable 4006 in favor of the lighter and more versatile Smith & Wesson M&P 40, also chambered in .40 S&W. From possibly the mid 1980's until 2008 the Atlanta Police Department used the 4003 TSW until replacing it with the Smith & Wesson M&P.

The model 4046 (double action only) is issued by Brink's to its armored truck crews. The 4046 was the first semi-automatic pistol to be issued by Brink's as a duty sidearm, replacing .38 caliber Smith and Wesson revolvers. As of 2011 it was being superseded by the Smith and Wesson M&P 40 in Brink's inventory, although some guards were still being issued 4046s and .38 revolvers until completion of the changeover to M&Ps.

It is perhaps one of the most well known 'pocket guns' on the market, and its level of durability and ease-of-use surpass industry standards.
These were just a few of the reasons why we purchased this gun in the first place.  While we cannot consider it a 'new' firearm, it has only fired less than 200 rounds.  Within that 200, there were no malfunctions whatsoever, and the gun performed perfectly.
Also included in this sale is an extra magazine (which we bought aftermarket, but it is Ruger factory brand); and a 50rd box of PPU FMJ .380 Auto ammunition (Since we really have no use for it once we've sold the LCP).

Here are just a few bits of data, concerning the description, dimensions, and functions of the weapon.

Caliber: 	.380 Auto
Capacity: 	6+1
Length: 	5.16""
Width: 	0.82""
Height: 	3.60""
Barrel Material: 	Alloy Steel
Barrel Finish 	Blued
Slide Material 	Alloy Steel
Slide Finish 	Blued
Grip Frame 	Black, High Performance, Glass-Filled Nylon

Details about the ammo Manufacturer:

Military Ballistics Industries (MBI) specializes in custom ammunition and ordinance products for use by the military, law enforcement agencies, and training facilities in the United States.

This remanufactured (reloaded in a factory) product is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, reloadable, and packaged in 100 round, sealed plastic-packs. It is both economical and precision manufactured by an established American cartridge producer. 

Remanufactured ammunition has been around for decades. Some of the world’s best shooters use only remanufactured or custom manufactured ammunition to achieve a level of consistency and optimal ballistics performance that cannot be achieved with mass-manufactured ammunition. Remanufactured ammunition is produced by assembling carefully selected components to include specialty bullets, propellants, primers, and previously spent brass cartridge casings. The bullets, propellant, and primers are always newly manufactured while the brass cartridge casings are typically reprocessed to reduce costs or improve consistency. 

This MBI product is manufactured using only the highest quality products available to ensure consistent ballistics and firing performance. The propellant is manufactured by Hodgdon, the bullets are manufactured at either the Lake City military manufacturing facilities or by Hornaby, and the primers are manufactured by either CCI or Winchester. In addition to using only the best available components, MBI ammunition is assembled using some of the most modern electronic press equipment available. Because exceptional consistency is a major factor in creating accurate ammunition, a production facility that uses finely calibrated electronic press technology is key to ensuring that each shooter is well-pleased with the performance of their ammunition. 

Each brass cartridge casing used to produce MBI ammunition is processed by first undergoing a lengthy mechanical cleansing process. Once cleaned, each casing is then re-calibrated by an electronic press to ensure that the final dimensions of each round are within micrometer tolerances. Each casing is then re-primed and re-charged using high-quality primer and propellants. Once the new bullet is seated using a precision-tuned electronic press, each round is hand-inspected to ensure perfection. 

This product is not just remanufactured ammunition. It is “precision” remanufactured ammunition for the serious shooter. The fact that it costs less than most new ammunition is simply an added benefit"

Instead they are a black stained wood. Although they are very classy,It is just not the look I am going for. These are really nice, high quality grips. Apparently these are factory grips from Ruger that they made for the TALO edition and these are they ones that they over produced. I don't want to mess with return shipping, so I thought I'd see if anyone on here would take them first. Just looking to get what I put in them which was like $45.

This weapon comes with everything seen in the picture except the bi-pod. Lets go over some of the details shall we? 

This Model 12 has had some work done to it. I am not certain of where the work was performed but I will describe it to the best of my ability. 

The rifle has a free float barrel with glass bedding. The barrel is threaded and has a machined muzzle brake that is almost seamless. The rifle also has an aftermarket fully adjustable trigger with a very clean pull. I'm not certain of the brand on the trigger, I believe it is either a Rifle Basix or Timney. 

The rifle also comes with a Burris Black Diamond 8x32x50 long range scope. The scope is held in place with a Ken Farrell 20 MOA steel base and Burris Signature Zee steel high rings. It also has comes with a sunshade. 

This is a sub MOA rifle for serious distance shooting.

I am always gone and traveling so never get time and it is collecting dust. Black plastic rifle case and scope protector/cover included in the deal. 

I am a very experienced marksmanship expert and if you want a rifle with dead accuracy at long distance this rifle will make you happy. Perfect eye relief and very little kick but serious knock down and is deadly in the hands of a good shooter. The Simmons scope will reach out and touch your target with the 4-12 power lens and is crystal clear. 

I am in love with this rifle and have had a hard time deciding to finally let it go. Either let it go or see it go to waste."

Edit: Viridian C5L laser sold. Gun alone $400 firm.

""Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty.  The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular in the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy-framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted in some available space that was used to increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds. The results speak for themselves -- the flush-fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W.

The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. """

Bump firing is the act of using the recoil of a firearm to fire multiple shots in rapid succession. This process involves holding the foregrip with the non-trigger hand, releasing the grip on the firing hand (leaving the trigger finger in its normal position in front of the trigger), pushing the rifle forward in order to apply pressure on the trigger finger from the trigger, and keeping the trigger finger stationary. The firearm will recoil and then return to its previous position after the round has been fired first resetting and then pressing forward against the trigger thereby firing successive shots. The relatively-rapid bursts from semi-automatic firearms crudely simulate the discharge of automatic firearms. Even though a large number of rounds are fired in rapid succession, the trigger finger initiates each discharge; therefore, fully automatic fire is not actually taking place."

It's alot of fun to shoot and will give you quite a tight group if you can handle the recoil, however I fancy myself as more of a Lee Enfield kind of guy. The rifling and bore are in very nice condition and everything matches except the Tula stock it was refurbished in. Like I said, this is an Rguns.net rifle, and I believe it is genuine. For more info on Rgun's PU Snipers, go here: http://russian-mosin-nagant-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=556
I have had no problems whatsoever with this rifle, except for when a small piece of the stock chipped off the rifle during firing, which I believe is due to the stock being a refurb and not broken in. I fixed it with a bit wood glue, and it has not come loose since. Because of this damage to the stock (although slight), I am willing to take a loss on the rifle. I originally paid $800 (closer to $900 after shipping), and I am asking for $600 OR best offer. Also if you have a nice SMLE or other WW1 era Lee Enfield, I would be willing to make a deal. Either way my FFL Dealer in Martinez would be willing to make the transfer, or we can use yours. For more pictures and information please feel free to send me a message if you have any questions.

About the ACOG:
""The concept is simple; a durable scope with a reticle that illuminates in low light situations. And the best part is that it doesn't require batteries. Over 25 years later, the original ACOG stands the test of time and remains one of our most popular items. ACOG 4x32 Scope with Full Line Red Illumination features black crosshairs during daytime and tritium illuminates reticle at night. The reticle ranges out to 800 meters for 5.56 (.223 cal).""

About the LT100:
""This very popular QD-mount for the Trijicon ACOG is being used world-wide. Its two lever design provides exceptional durability, stability and repeatability. It's rock-solid and the only way to fly...looks great too. 
Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and matt black anodized to provide a durable non-reflective surface finish. The locking LaRue Speed Lever provides outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.""

Condition needs to be good or above. I Am also looking for a Nice Winchester/ Remington 12gauge shotgun. I had to sell my Deer 870 a couple years ago and need to replace it. A .50 MuzzleLoader just isn't the same. I am however restricted to a price range of about $500, and have some guns I would be willing to trade to help the deal. Up for offer I have-

A 1954 CZ52 (Vz52) czechoslovakian military 7.62x25mm handgun, overall excellent condition, I have 3 military original magazines, original leather holster in good condition, 2 original military lanyards, an original cleaning rod, and approximately 30rds of custom 100gr Hornady XTP hollowpoints traveling at 1500fps. With surplus fmj I can easily explode 160z water bottle from 35+ yards away. Very accurate. I have a Hogue Handall grip sleeve on the firearm that also features palm swells and pebbling. Gives an EXCELLENT grip

The next item is an old dog, a Mix and Matched Lee Enfield No.4 Mk.1 .303british bolt action rifle. This is a truely accurate rifle, and the .303 british cartridge provides enough performance to down any creature you are likely to encounter in this area of the Nation. The stock is in overall rough shape, no cracks, it has just been used and bumped a lot. Remaining Blueing is about 45percent, but there is no rust. 10-shot box magazine. This rifle has the slickest bolt action I have ever handled.

Almost forgot- I just acquired a nice old 1960's-1970-s Marlin Glenfield Model 60, semi-automatic .22lr. The blueing is beautiful and the wood is nice just needs re-staining (which I might do, did it on my mosin not too long ago). This little rifle has a 17rd tubular magazine and stouts a very, very thick, accurate micro-groove barrel, these rifles are reknowned for their inherent accuracy. Put 25rds through it today and 1 malfunction cause by low pressure remington rounds which failed to completely cycle the bolt. Shot a squirrel from about 3 yards away (muzzle to squirrel) today and put the HP right though his heart, killing it instantly. Features nice old leveraction style sights which I love, and I think they encourage accuracy. 

If you have a 30-30 levergun you are looking to get rid of Let me know, or if you have a nice 12gauge shotgun, I am sure we can work something out. Send me an email at REDACTED , thanks for your time."

Only problem is that it needs a new gas tube (about $30) so it doesn't cycle. It fires great, I've run about 100 rounds through it without fail, very accurate, great shooter, just doesn't cycle because the gas tube is pitted. The bore is great and everything else works flawlessly. But until the gas tube is replaced it's pretty much a bolt action rifle lol. 

I don't want to sell it, but I lost my job and need to pay rent, and I already have another Norinco SKS so this one has to go. 

I'm open to trade offers, or partial trade offers, but really need the cash for bills so I would prefer to sell it outright.

$1800, cash only please.  This gun currently retails for $2460, there is a 6 month wait to get a new one, and mine is like new (I've never even let anyone handle it if they had a ring on their finger for fear of marring the finish).

997,http://www.armslist.com/posts/455997,For Sale/Trade:  Price Reduced! Steel Fireproof Safe (Gun Safe?),"Garrett, Kentucky, United States","$ 1,100","Listed On: Monday, July 2, 2012",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Very good condition steel fireproof safe. Can be use as a gun safe. I am posting this safe for my Step-Dad (he don't like posting or doing business on line - as he put it ""I'm a low tech man in a high tech world""...lol). Anyway, the safe originally came from a U.S. Post Office (somewhere in a small town in Eastern KY). To my understanding, a lady that used to work in the post office had the safe in her basement for at least 30 years. My Step-Dad does carpentry work on the side (he is a retired U.S.M.C. and U.S. Army Reserved). The safe is part of his pay for doing carpentry work for this lady (he's just trying to get his money back). The safe is located in Eastern Kentucky (Floyd County). See the pics, and just email me for any questions. And I will try my best to answer the questions. By the way, the safe is on wheels (as pictured), and weight at least 2,500 pounds. The safe has the combination plus key features. This safe is built like Fort Knox. Asking for $1,100 or best offer, or trade. Thanks for looking."
