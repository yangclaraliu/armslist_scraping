It has the original blade bayonet, original cleaning rod, original cleaning kit, 10 stripper clips, 200 rounds of Russian match grade 7.62x39 ammo, and case. The bore is bright and shiny with strong rifling. The bluing is original and none of the pats have been painted over later. The stock is its original dark hardwood finish and has the original serial number without being forced matched and having a bunch of XXXXX's over the old serial number. The stock has no cracks or deep gouges, just minor handling wear. The receiver cover is marked with the Tula star inside the star logo and has the date stamp of 1952r under the logo. I bought this gun over a year and a half ago and it has sat in the safe ever since. I have never fired it, and never planned to in order to keep it in the collectors condition it is currently in. I know what this gun is worth as would any serious SKS collector so please don't try to low ball me and compare this with the Yugo's and Norinco's out there. Take a look at gunbroker for similar condition rifles and you will see that there are few out there and are worth every bit of my asking price.

I've got a Yugo SKS for sale. I have had it for a few months now. I don't really get a chance to go shooting as much as I was hoping and I am looking to get some money for car parts so I am posting it for sale to see if anybody would like to enjoy this rifle. 

It is an all stock rifle besides the gas plug, which has been replaced with a stainless steel one. (As far as I know this is common as the factory plugs get corroded.) It is the model with the grenade launcher which is still in tack, as well as the grenade sights. With the sale I will include 110 rounds of misc ammunition with 9 stripper clips (10 if I can find the other, but I doubt it.) The ammo is a mix of Brown Bear, a few Wolf rounds, and Tula walmart ammo. Same crap different name, all of it shoots fine. 

After I got the gun I cleaned it really well and I cleaned it after shooting as well. The stock is a little beat up but it doesn't effect the performance. It has a soldiers initials carved into the wood (not very deep). It could probably be sanded and refinished, personally I like the wear. I think it adds a little cool factor to the gun. 

If you've got any questions or concerns, would like more pictures, or would like to setup a time to meet/purchase the gun please email me at kinser.hair (at) gmail.com

About 30 rds of buckshot put through gun...works flawlessly.  Only blemish is on the receiver, there is a scratch in the blueing that is completely covered when the stock is folded on top of gun.
Can shoot gun with pistol grip when stock is folded on top of gun, or from shoulder when stock is extended.  Built in pads on sides of forearm activate light when you grip forearm, unless you turn that feature off.  This is a very intimidating firearm and is a perfect home defense weapon."

Here is what Botach charges for it:  http://www.botachtactical.com/lema4cq.html

I've had this for a few years, mounted on a rifle that saw perhaps 100 rounds of range use.  I've gone another direction, and am ready to sell this excellent scope at a loss.  I am willing to ship.

Here is what the ad text from the manufacturer states:

Product Highlights The Leupold Mark 4® CQ/T™ 1-3x14mm is a revolutionary optical sight for tactical firearms such as the AR15 and M16, combining the strengths of a red dot sight and a variable-power riflescope. Only the Mark 4® CQ/T™ is ready and able to handle the variety of situations most common to both law enforcement and the military.

The Mark 4 CQ/T also has range-estimating capabilities. Aside from the standard dot, this has an outer circle. This is the key for range estimation. A 6' target will fit snug inside the circle at 100 yards. At 200 yards the 6 ft. target will fit in-between the center dot and the circle. Even I couldn't mess that up!

The Circle Dot reticle of the Mark 4 CQ/T is designed to offer fast target acquisition in any environment. Dot Size: 3 MOA at 3x, 9 MOA at 1x. Circle Size: Edge to edge, the subtension of the circle is 18 inches at 25 yards, or 6 feet at 100 yards when set on 3x. From the center of the dot to the edge of the circle, the subtension is 6 feet at 200 yards when set on 3x. Circle Line: The width of the line creating the circle is large enough to be easily visible, but thin enough so as not to obliterate an 18-inch object at 500 yards when set on 3x. Range Estimating -Place the target inside the circle of the CQ/T reticle. At 3x the diameter equates to 6 feet in height at 100 yards. At 200 yards, 6 feet is measured from the dot to the edge of the circle."

This pistol is pretty sweet. Was sitting in a safe for years before I traded for it. I already have a ruger mark iii and don't need this one.

Its been fully stripped and cleaned, slide, and slide ramp polished. 

Comes with a single magazine. The feed lips on this magazine are too wide causing the rounds to feed too high. Its an easy correction with a caliper, but I do not own one and am not in a hurry to fix it. You can read on the highstandard website on how to properly adjust a magazine or just purchase a new one.

It is a phenomenal shape, bluing is very nice, functions smoothly(besides the magazine feeding issue. Field strips in less then 5 seconds. Comes with a magazine(original) a scope mount(not sure if it is original but I have not scene another like it).

These pistols auction for 400-600 not including transfer and backround check.

I will sell for 275FIRM. Price is so low because of the magazine issue.

I have used it off and on hunting and at the range with the same battery stored in it for 3 years now.

This revolver is in excellent original condition with the original fitted cardboard box with the same serial number as the handgun.  The US Arms medallion grips are in excellent shape with only a few minor marks.  The US Arms Abilene company of Riverhead, NY, shares the same roots as the Sporting Arms, Inc, Seville.  The Abilene was intended to compete head to head with the Ruger Blackhawk.  

If you are looking for a great .357 Single Action, don't let this get away, it is far nicer than any modern equivalent.  Shot very little.  Has the traditional 1/2 cock position of the Colt SA.  I can provide the history of the handgun as I'm only the 3rd owner.  It has the transfer bar safety and was the subject of a lawsuit against them by Ruger.  After face to face discussion, Bill Ruger agreed to allow the patent to be used by US Arms.  

The gun is a reloaders dream as the .357 cylinder is a .44 Mag cylinder blank drilled for the .357 caliber.  Very tight tolerances.  See www.singleactions.com for additional information.

Sold ftf with valid CO drivers liscense or CCW.  Shipping direct to FFL is $35, if FFL to FFL, additional $20 (exactly my costs).  This firearm can be transferred within the State of California per the California DOJ Firearms Website."

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components 

- Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm) 
- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications

The pistol has had less than 300 rounds through it (range ammo and personal defense ammo have all fed and fired flawlessly with great accuracy).  The only real wear is on the slide release (typical and cheap to replace if you wish).

Included:  Original case, cleaning rod, and paperwork, 23 rounds of Hornady defense, OWB Kydex holster, IWB Blackhawk holster, Sheerer pinky extension, 2 Mags, and a grip-hole plug.

My personal tests in a 92 Chevy PU, 91 Toyota Corolla and Yamaha TT500, Honda XR 500 and a Yamaha 660 grizzly... - Faster starts , Crispier throttle response the 92 Chevy received 6 miles to the gallon better ... the Toyota already was getting 30 MPG but jumped to 34 in addition my wife admitted she drove it faster because it felt better ... ...


This was a interesting find ...

Fuel type also affects mileage. Most gasoline in the U.S. today is 8-10 percent ethanol, but the EPA does its tests with 100 percent gasoline in the tank. The use of ethanol to increase the amount of oxygen in gasoline for better combustion can reduce fuel efficiency by around 6 percent all by itself.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ethanol is about 29.8 kJ/gram combusted

octane is about 44.2 kJ/gram combusted

but ethanol is denser and because fuel efficiency for liquids is based on volumetric rates not mass rates it comes out to

ethanol is 23.5 kJ/mL

octane is about 31.2 kJ/mL
that is 75% the fuel density

so that 15% ethanol is 25% less fuel rich then pure gasoline.

so bottom line is that 15% ethanol fuel is 96% as energy rich as 100% gasoline by volume

Its a super pistol, I'm just not attached to things, and want $$ so I can turn around and try another pistol.

It has the V3 trigger, with DA on the first pull then SA after that, or rack the slide and it goes SA with the first pull, the trigger is breaking in  (as HK forums told me it would), decocker on the back, ambi everything else, no external safety.

I bumped my listing because wanted to update and let potential buyers know that I'm moving the pistol to the Firing Line in Aurora, CO on Potomac as I've decided I wanted a middle man.   Being female and getting some rude posts from a couple potential buyers makes me quite leary of meeting up to sell to a private individual.

Designed for maximum speed of target acquisition and peak accuracy in low light, there's nothing like the BUSHNELL Tactical 2x32 MP Scope, Red/Green T-Dot Reticle, Matte finish. It easily fits on tactical rifles and shotguns with an integrated mount for weaver-style rails.

This model features a rugged body construction, which is rustproof, scratch-proof and dust proof to protect the inside elements from hazards.

Amber-Bright high contrast lens coatings help you discern deerbrown from all the other browns in the woods. Multi-coated optics gather maximum available light when you're on the prowl at dawn and dusk.

The Tactical 2x32 MP is waterproof and fogproof, therefore remains crystal-clear in all types of weather. It is also nitrogen-purged to remove any vestige of internal moisture.

With red dot for every application from plinking to hunting to tactical, the Bushnell is the only name you need to know for illuminated 2x sighting solutions."

This is a one of a kind handmade Bowie Knife with a beautiful Handmade Leather Sheath. I am the original owner of this knife and it has never left my home. The knife has been valued by Blade Gallery at 400.00. This Knife is in as new condition. The description is as follows:
Maker: Gib Guignard, Weight: 26.72 oz,Blade Length: 9""Total Length: 14"", Blade Thickness: 0.24"", Blade Width: 1.87"", Blade: 5160 Carbon Steel with a rustic finish, Bolster: Nickel Silver Guard and Butt, Handle: Polished Elk Antler with a marbleized Malachite spacer, Sheath: Brown Leather with lace up, Comments: Gib Guignard subscribed to the Neo Tribal way of thinking. His knives are finished with a rustic look which is just like it came from the forge. The bevels are ground giving the knife blade a two tone look. This crates an antique appearance which is very unique.
The balance falls slightly forward of the guard on this wonderful Bowie making it very quick in the hand. The 9"" long blade is forged 5160 Carbon Steel with a rustic finish that is offset by the bright polished Elk Antler handle. The handle is separated from the Nickel Silver Guard by a marbleized Malachite spacer.
Comes with all of the original paperwork from The Blade Gallery ensuring authenticity.
There will be no more knives from this unique craftsman. This is a rare opportunity to own one of his uncompromising masterpieces."

This would look great on a nickel boron lower or on a regular black one. For any questions please call Steve at REDACTED. This has been test fired and is ready to mount up to your lower. I build all my uppers with receivers from spikes, delton, grizzly etc, and all my barrels are USA made and come from the same factory that supplies, palmetto, saa, dt, and many others so asking what brand does not apply as I build with what is on hand. All parts function great and are tested before sold.( if you want the rifle kit this will not include the stripped lower)"

As a kid I remember him bringing home at least six buck over the 10 years he hunted.  A while back he mentioned to me that he'd only ever bought two boxes of cartridges and nearly fifty years later I still have almost a full box left.  When asked what happened to the other cartridges he said he took out an Oak tree every now and then for practice.  Dad passed earlier this year, and we no longer have a need for his rifle, but mom would like it to go to someone who'll actually use it.  She also wants a fair price.  A local gun shop I visited earlier today said it was worth about $500, but their offer to buy it was well under half that.

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.
