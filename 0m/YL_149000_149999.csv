This is a Browning Hi Power manufactured by Fabrique Nationale.  Not sure on MKI/II/III, but the serial number puts it as being made in 1986.  This model has the alloy frame and as such is pretty rare.  The entire gun was just refinished in matte black.  Magazine disconnect is still in the gun and the hammer has not been bobbed.  Will come with one 13rd magazine (matching markings).

Both mags will be fully loaded with ammo.

It is in a like new condition. 

The AS trigger system of the Walther P99 has three possible carry modes: 

AS Mode The first is the AS mode which will automatically engage after a round is chambered. The trigger is fully forward, as if in double action, but the striker indicator is to the rear and visible. This mode offers the safety of carrying the P99 AS in single action with a light yet long trigger pull. 

DA Mode The second mode is Double Action. After a round is chambered, the decocking button can be depressed, releasing the striker into a double action trigger pull. In this mode the trigger is fully forward and the striker is at rest and no longer visible to the rear of the slide. After the trigger is first pulled, all subsequent shots will be in single action. This mode is considered, among fellow P99 AS owners, to be the safest mode to carry the AS in. 

SA Mode The third mode of carry for the P99 AS is Single Action. This mode can be achieved by chambering a round into the AS mode, then slowly pulling the trigger to the rear until you hear the SA portion of the sear engage. There will be an audio able click and the trigger will remain in the rear position. This mode will also automatically engage after the first trigger pull in double action mode. 


The barrel and slide have been hardness treated in the same manner that Glock has been, but Walther calls it by another trade name than Tennifer. 

I would like to trade for Walther P99C. Roind count at 200. No low ball offers please. 

Will trade for: Walther P99C, PPS, XDM, Kimber, Sig, HK, Beretta Inox, Judge"

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 TACPAC comes in two versions; 1911 Railed and 1911 Non-railed.

This is the Railed version.

1911 Railed kit includes:
1911 Nitron rail pistol
CPL-1 Compact pistol laser
1911 Holster with integrated mag pouch
Two (2) magazines
Speed loader

Armory Racks are a patented-pending high-density space-saving solution for handguns. The racks are designed to allow in-place pistol removal and replacement in tight storage spaces like safes, where space is precious and expensive. They’re also equipped with sturdy carrying handles allowing easy portability from location to location, like a safe to a display area, or a work area. The carrying handles also double as a means of securing mounted pistols using a cable lock. Armory Racks also can optionally be configured with a storage tray, so spare magazines and small accessories can be stored below the pistols, providing easy access."

It's a handsome gun with a pinned four inch barrel and adjustable sights, wearing Pachmayr presentation grips. Lock-up is nice and tight with no endshake, I personally have always cleaned and oiled it after every use. I've decided I need something with fixed sights for my walks in the woods. So I'm looking for something else in a K, N, or L frame Smith as an even trade, as for caliber, I'm a big fan of 38 Special, but I'm willing to look at 357s, 44 Specials are always interesting, lastly a 22lr revolver (even with adjustable sights) would definitely work. I am looking for something with a barrel length between 3"" and 5.5"". I also have an interest in Colt Double Action Revolvers, but don't know too much about them. If you need pics email me, it's impossible for me to put pictures up from my phone.

The only long gun I would be interested in trading for would be a Marlin 39A plus 100$"

497,http://www.armslist.com/posts/149497,For Sale:  Diamondback DB380 with extras,"Lafayette, Indiana, United States",$ 280,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 15, 2011",Handguns,no type,380 ACP,no type,no type,"I am selling a Diamondback DB380 in excellent condition. The DB380 has been called a ""Mini Glock"" as it breaks down exactly like the Glock models. The DB 380 fits nicely in a pocket holster and is comparable in size/weight to a Ruger LCP or Keltec 3AT while having less recoil and better accuracy.

The DB380 comes with the original case, owners manual and gun lock. Also included is a DeSantis pocket holster and an extra factory magazine.

I like this gun a lot, but I already have a carry pistol so I do not need two. In full disclosure, I did have to send the pistol back to Diamondback to repair a broken trigger spring after about 150 rounds but since then it has functioned well.

The price is: $280 firm.  Please be willing to show a LTCH card and a driver’s license. I am not interested in any trades."

Bought used from a pro to use it in class, and am now trying to get some of my money back that I spent for the class and everything. After cocking the gun, it shoots with easy, very light trigger.

Condition - Like New- no wear marks on the inside leather, no scuffs or marks on outside leather. Kydex inner sweat lip has some light scuffs from when the holster was made.

The Hybrid Warrior holster is no longer available, Hoffner stopped making this amazing holster in 2009 and this is one of the last ones.  

From Hoffners website - The Hybrid Warrior is a masterpiece of form and function. Possibly the most beautiful holster ever but designed for the hip of the professional. The pistol is encased in premium leather that is hand molded by our artisan and includes a tension device. Kydex provides a molded sight channel, a hidden belt slide and a “No look flap” for easy re-holstering and protection.  The holster rides high and tight to the body for concealment.  The Hybrid Warrior is for those who settle for nothing less than winning the fight.

Features:
- Soft leather against the gun with tough kydex on the outside
- Kydex provides easy no look re-holstering

The rifle doesnt have optics bc thats how i bought it and since i never shot it, i never bothered to put anything on it.

No big defects other than a nick here and there.  Nothing catastrophic.  It is my understanding that this was a police officer's duty weapon through the 80's, but that is just what I'm told.  All original, including the original Colt medallion wood grips.  Will include the black Pearce grips seen in the photo.  Call or text REDACTED for more photos.

I love this gun, but money is tight and I need something more practical for CCW.  My trade wishes are very specific, so I won't bother with them here.  Trades may be considered but probably not.

Lightest weight 380 available. Ive fired this gun around 150 rounds or maybe a bit less too break it in as the manual suggest. It jammed one time and that was with a glazer safety slug and that was after about forty rounds and has never jammed since.
 The only reason I am selling it is a lifelong best friend recently passed away and Ive been given his firearm collection and he as well had one that he carried as well and Ive decided to sell mine and keep his pistol and carry it instead and that way he still kind of ""Has my back"" like we always have since fourth grade. Hopefully it will never have to be used but having his as my carry weapon is alot more valued than mine. So again Ive decided to sell mine and 200 bucks is a great deal. Comes with box and book. Purchased new about a year ago.Its just a nuthin fancy backup weapon or excellent concealed carry firearm for both men and women. Very good shooter and to be so small very accurate.Easy to conceal and carry as today Im wearing a pair of nylon swimming type trunks and it just dissapears in my pocket and looks like a pocket knife clipped in my pocket.
 Has the metal pocketknife type pocket or belt clip already on it to carry without a holster but comes with a uncle Mikes in the waistband holster and a nylon itp holster as well and one magazine. I personally carried it in my right pocket using the pocket knife style clip that is an option and if you dont like it it removes with an allen wrench.
 Has some very fine rub marks from carrying but otherwise looks new. If you want a fine little concealed carry pistol then this is it.

I have a Baby Glock for sale. It's in great condition, only one nick on the butt of the slide, but it's been used in the field so that's to be expected. It's modded with an extended slide release (if you've used a 26 before you know that the stock slide release is a bit short and tough on the thumb). It also has Meprolight Tritium night sights installed ($90 value). I will include the original sights and original slide release in case you want to un-mod it. The gun comes with the original case, all original documents, and the original lock. The gun has been cleaned and oiled consistently its entire life.

Included Accessories:
~7 magazines
     - 1 10-round (Grip extension installed) ($25 value)
     - 1 10+2-round (Capacity extension makes it 12 rounds) ($35 value)

~Barrel snake
~50 rounds of Remington UMC Luger Ammunition
~8 rounds of Glaser Cor-Bon Pow'RBall Ammunition 
     -(I had more rounds, but have misplaced them.)


This is a fantastic sub-compact for CC and range shooting. It's surprisingly accurate for its size. It's in great shape and you won't find one that comes with all the mods and accessories for anywhere near this price. 


ALL OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED!


Note: I will not sell to anyone under 21 years of age or anyone who is not an Arizona resident.

 Both mags will be fully loaded with ammo.

 It is in a like new condition. 

The AS trigger system of the Walther P99 has three possible carry modes: 

AS Mode The first is the AS mode which will automatically engage after a round is chambered. The trigger is fully forward, as if in double action, but the striker indicator is to the rear and visible. This mode offers the safety of carrying the P99 AS in single action with a light yet long trigger pull. 

DA Mode The second mode is Double Action. After a round is chambered, the decocking button can be depressed, releasing the striker into a double action trigger pull. In this mode the trigger is fully forward and the striker is at rest and no longer visible to the rear of the slide. After the trigger is first pulled, all subsequent shots will be in single action. This mode is considered, among fellow P99 AS owners, to be the safest mode to carry the AS in. 

SA Mode The third mode of carry for the P99 AS is Single Action. This mode can be achieved by chambering a round into the AS mode, then slowly pulling the trigger to the rear until you hear the SA portion of the sear engage. There will be an audio able click and the trigger will remain in the rear position. This mode will also automatically engage after the first trigger pull in double action mode. 


The barrel and slide have been hardness treated in the same manner that Glock has been, but Walther calls it by another trade name than Tennifer. 

I would like to trade for Walther P99C. Roind count at 200. No low ball offers please. 

Will trade for: Walther P99C, PPS, XDM, Kimber, Sig, HK, Beretta Inox, Judge"
