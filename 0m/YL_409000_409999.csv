I will consider trading it for an SKS, 12 gauge pump shotgun (marverick, mossberg 500 or remington 870) or maybe a nice 22lr rifle.  Some of these might need extra cash either way for a deal.  Also throw out anything you have that you are willing to trade.  I will consider all trades but handguns because of my age.  Email me REDACTED and put M44 in the title line."

I really don't know what I want I just know I have several awesome guns to trade. I want to maybe trade for a hk sl8 or a ps90 or Od green fs2000 or fn scar in .223/5.56 or .308 or desert eagle .50 ae I just want something out of the box and I have several items I could trade

#1) kimber Eclipse target II. 
#2) arsenal ak47 slr107-f (tan furniture)
#3) M1A socom II VLTOR rail(black)
#4) M1A socom 16 camo stock
#5) Saiga 12 converted cerakoted and camo hydra dipped
#6) black fs2000(will only trade for an Od green fs2000
#7) walther p22(black)
I am willing to put multiple guns together for the right trade. I also have s little walther p22 I could put in to make it work.  I will not be robbed on this end, I love all of my guns I'm just curious what's out there. Before I lose the farm on my end I would just sell one and have kings gun and pawn(the best gun store on the planet imo) order me one. This is being done out of total curiosity of what's out there. I might trade a 1911 for a slide fire ar15 or ar10. Just let me know. I'm a nice guy and I will try and answer ever email unless u lowballme then I will just erase it and forget about it. Thank u and god bless!"

It uses CCI mini mag the best. Does have an Extended charging handle to help with charging when you have a scope on the rifle. does have the the ipc factory scope rail. Also installed a small piece of metal and painted to match in the mag release to aid in relasing the mag. It can be removed if the buyer does not really like it it just screws in and out (can been seen in one of the pics). Includes 1 factory 10rd mag.

This is a beautiful 25 Calib. Chrome hand gun, great for a night out CCW.
Can be also a gift for any person, a spouse/girlfriend -perhaps for a purse or ankle back-up.
I had ordered a custom made leather holster for it. ALL BRAND NEW , NIB.
You get all I have: the Hand gun in its original box, the manual, 1 magazine, and the leather Holster.
I will even throw in a couple of box of Ammo.  Great piece, they dont make them like this anymore.

A2 stock, standard pistol grip that has had the second, upper ridge shaved down (Because it feels better that way to me) and flip up rear BUIS. I can throw in the rail covers and stubby verty grip that I have also. Will also have a 10 round magazine included.

Fully NY compliant. 

I originally didn't plan on selling it, so it's painted with krylon in an OD, brown, and tan mixture of camo. Made the pattern by using grass and a leaf as a pattern.

I've had no issues with it, I built it as sort of a DMR style role with the HBAR.

I haven't settled on a price. I spent about $900 on it, so I'm thinking since it's very lightly used (only about 100 rounds or so total) that I'll sell it for the $700 - $900 range. Price can be negotiated some if the deal is acceptable to me.

The guns I'm looking for in trade are as follows in order from highest (most wanted) to lowest (least wanted), we can perhaps strike a deal via a full trade, cash, or both cash and trade.

AK74 of some sort, possibly a fully converted 5.45 saiga. Looking for one that has a 74' muzzle brake attached. Of course if it's a cheaper 74' then we'd have to do cash + trade (I know most Arsenal AK74s are in the price range of the value of my AR. I wouldn't mind making a trade for one.)
AK47 of some sort, I'd prefer if it had some form of muzzle device. (I own a saiga 7.62 and the recoil isn't something I like without a brake.)
A FAL/L1A1/R1A1 is something I am also looking for, if it's century I'd prefer it's an imbel.
I'd swap my upper for your upper, I'm looking for a 14.5 mid length govt profile with perm attached muzzle brake to bring it to 16""
I'm also interested in historic rifles. Garands, M1A, M1 carbines, all sorts of guns like that.

Just generally interested in military rifles, so throw me a trade idea if you've got any military rifles you want gone, and find my AR to be attractive.

But primarily I'm looking for something along the lines of AK47/74. So please, send me an email and see if we can make a deal.

Only looking to do FTF sales in northern NY, we can both drive half way."

My price is firm since I priced it low already......

Genuine Browning Hi-Power P35s are still manufactured by FN Herstal of Belgium and Portugal, and under license by Fabricaciones Militares (FM) of Argentina. The Hi-Power remains one of the most influential pistols in the history of small arms. It has inspired a number of clone manufacturers (including Charles Daly of the Philippines & USA, FEG of Hungary, Arcus of Bulgaria, IMI of Israel, and others). Many modern pistols borrow features from it, such as the staggered column high-capacity magazine, and the Browning linkless cam locking system (which on modern pistols is often simplified so that the barrel locks into the ejection port, meaning the barrel and slide do not have to be machined for locking lugs). Until recently, FEG made an almost exact clone in 9mm and .40 S&W, but the company now manufactures a version with modifications to the barrel, linkage, and slide stop that are incompatible with genuine Hi-Powers. Arcus has also superseded its Hi-Power clone with a model that draws heavily from the Hi-Power but is capable of double-action operation."

All the extras add to be $105. 
I am asking for $700 for the gun or $750 for everything. These MSRP @ around 900 and stores sell them for around $775 plus tax."

3)- Why do you post a condescending ad about someone you think is ""trying to rip people off"" when you're doing the SAME THING posting a USED air compressor for $350 that costs $270 BRAND NEW?!?! And the guy with the M44 is the one trying to rip people off?!?!

Located in Alexandria,fairfax, arlington.  You can come pick it up at any time. Only prerequisites are need to be over 18 and show  VA ID and have 600 cash. This is a private sale. The price seems to be high only to compensate for the ammo and mags. Otherwise this is a fair asking price. It might not sell quick but im not worried because I do not need money so quick, but for this piece oh yeah its firm.
The Glock 31 is a great modular gun. If you go to the internet you can buy a lone wolf conversion barrel for about $100. You can change out the barrel and put a 33 rd extended magazine if you would like to shoot 9mm. or you could change out the barrel to .40 S&W. The glock 22 40s&W mags are interchangeable with the glock 31 .357 sig mag. The .357 sig cartridge is basically a necked down .40 s&w with a .355 bullet (9mm) on top. With the rounds im throwing in your getting @ 1350fps and 650 ft/lbs. That is plenty of accuracy and stopping power. contact me for serious inquiries only. I will sell for $550 cash with the quickness."

In 1998 Joe Roebuck recognized the increasing demand for a safe, simple to use, and affordable firearm due to political climate changes and most states enacting legislation to allow conceal and carry permits. Joe Roebuck has been in the manufacturing industry for 35 years, and chooses to use his talents as a Tool & Die Maker and Mechanical Design Engineer to design the CPX series of firearms. . September 2003, Joe Roebuck founded Skyy Industries, LLC now known as Sccy Industries, LLC to produce a conceal & carry firearm known as the CPX 9mm. The company's first offices and manufacturing facility was located in South Daytona, Florida and as of February 2010 relocated to a new 21,000 sq. ft. facility located in Daytona Beach, Florida, just a half a mile from the famous Daytona 500 speedway.

Contained in Sccy's new facility are numerous state of the art CNC machining centers of various types using custom tooling and programs designed by Joe Roebuck. The barrel, slide, receiver and all other major metal components are manufactured at the new facility. It was Joe Roebuck's vision that the CPX series firearms could be both cost effective and precisely manufactured to be as good as or even better than other name brand name products, without the high cost to the retail buyer. Sccy is now positioned to continue producing and developing new designs for the CPX series firearms. The CPX series envisioned has been successfully manufactured and sold throughout the United States using its own dealer network. Sccy's success is benchmarked by producing over 45,000 firearms to date. This success continues to grow with the current introduction of the new ""Generation 2"" CPX series. This year, 2011 Sccy will produce CPX-1 and CPX-2 ""Generation 2"" pistols and expand its national dealer base to a new all time high.

New customer service procedures are now in place to insure fast and personal service to both retail customers and dealers in need of warranty service. We wish to thank every customer and dealer for the trust and continued loyalty to the Sccy brand and products."

These are steadily getting harder to come by.  This one was made in 1953.  Overall nice condition.  Couple of gouges in the stock but no cracks, and no major pitting on the metal.  Bore is shiny and rifling is sharp.  Numbers are not matching, but all metal bits and the stock are stamped with the ""02"", identifying them as having been produced in Hungary.  No sling or accessories, but it does include the bayonet.  Pics on request.  $125.

Prefer FTF transaction.  I can meet in the Springfield, IL area during the day and in Alton, IL evenings/weekends.  Will consider shipping, but only if it is on your dime (no ammo included if shipping).  No funny business -- all federal and ridiculous IL state laws will be followed (FOID, bill of sale, etc).  Thanks for looking!"
