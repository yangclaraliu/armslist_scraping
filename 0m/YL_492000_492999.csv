A stainless and aluminum, full length giude rod and enhanced spring. A ZR Tactical Solutions 2 port compensator for lower kick for speed shooting. Pewter grips. It will include all you see in the pics below wich is the original grips (rosewood), barrel bushing, spring plug, giude rod and barrel thread protector.

It's really an awesome shooter! I'm getting my carriers permit and want to get something a little bigger than a .22.....LOL"

Streamlight TLR-2 Laser Sight Tactical Flashlight is a powerful, intensely bright, long-running, aluminum-bodied gunmount light. This Streamlight flashlight sets a whole new standard for durability. This weapon light offers the same great features as its TLR-1 sibling, but with an integrated laser sight for faster and more accurate aiming. The Streamlight TLR-2 Tactical Light w/ Laser Sight is shockproof, dustproof, and virtually indestructible; the flashlight won't break or burn out. Streamlight has built the TLR-2 to be powered by two 3-volt CR123A lithium batteries with a 10-year storage life, providing the tactical light with at least 2.5 hours of continuous run time when in dual mode with the high power visible laser. The rail grip clamp system securely attaches/detaches quickly & easily with no tools and without putting your hands in front of the muzzle, and fits most handguns with rails as well as long guns with 1913 (Picatinny-style) rails. The Stream Light TLR2 Laser-Equipped Tactical Weapon Light gives you the advantage in any low-light situation."

This .38 Special version of the Smith 640 was made for only a few years.
S&W then went to making the .357 Mag version of this model. This .38spl 
version is sought after due to it's shorter barrel and lighter weight when
compared to the longer and heavier .357/640 model.

One of the very best snubbies ever for CCW use, and
ready for a lifetime of service.

The loaded chamber indicator and safety/decocker return spring came from Taurus non-functioning.

I have a modified ""field holster."" It's just a cheap holster I bought from Wal-Mart with an extra magazine pouch. I took a clip (J-clip, maybe?), cut a slit on the back, sewed the edges, and used Gorilla Glue to seal it in. I'm right handed and it fits inside the waistband (in the small of the back) at a slight cant toward the right...always worked for me.

VERY stout pistol, easy to shoot and an excellent CCW piece. I wanted the biggest ""small"" revolver I could find and this fit the bill. This is an older piece, which is good as it doesn't have the stupid integrated lock that the newer guns have. Old school Smith revolver quality. I've owned this gun for almost 20 years. Trigger pull is smooth and lock up is tight. Will include two speedloaders. I have and will include the original huge Houge rubber grips, but I replaced them with the low profile Pachmyr grips seen in the pics to aid in concealment.

..The Old Style 'Stevens'  Over & Under design has a .22 Long Rifle Barrel on top, paired with a .410 shotgun barrel below & is the perfect combination to hunt small game. It works equally well for casual plinking or protecting your field from 'CornGobblins'
 This one has plenty of the original beautiful color case hardening intact on the reciever and is in wonderful condition only seeing some light use years ago. The bores are near perfect, and the selector switch and everything else is in perfect order.
 NO major issues at all- just some minor scratches on the WW2 Era Tenite Plastic Stock (the Walnut went for the War Effort!) and a little wear along the edges of the painted metal trigger guard, but a very clean old combo gun!
 These older Stevens guns are very well made, extremely versatile, and prompt the shooter to aim carefully and conserve ammo...(Oh yeah! Like that's a BAD thing at Today's Prices!!!)
 I really like this gun, and am pretty firm on the price, but will trade for Silver...or ????..............Try me.                Thanks"

As for forward assist, I believe if a bullet is not firing for some reason why jam it down the tube even more. I'll just eject it, forward assist or not.  Just my personal opinion on that.

All lights work and even the tag light and mounting bracket work I do have it tagged and the title is in hand without any loans or liens. This is a bumper pull trailer that has a 2 5/16 "" opening. The inside has rope lights along the top with w light switch. It also has 2 motorcycle wheel chokes and this trailer has been done inside with plastic paneling on the side and ceiling and checkered flooring on the ramp and main floor. The entire back door folds down with spring assist and then it even has an extra flap that folds down to almost a flush ride in for loading.It also has a side door that is i think 36' wide. I got this trailer to haul my trike but i have recently sold my trike to buy a four wheeler. I had a 2003 Honda Goldwing. It fit very nicely inside and this trailer pulls very good. The tires are all goodyear 15"" and they have about 90% life left on them. I got this trailer in May and has been garage kept since then. The previous owner had it parked underneath a car port. There is some sun fading on top, but nothing to be concerned about. There is no leaks what so ever. I paid $3500.00 for this trailer and i want to sell it and will let it go if the price is right.

The Hard Sear info:
The Apex Fully Machined Sear (Hard Sear)* was designed to enhance the performance of what we consider an outstanding pistol. Our modified geometry will not only  improve the over-travel and sear reset characteristics, but dramatically reduce the trigger pull weight in most pistols. This sear is made from heat treated A-2 tool steel for durability and long service life. 

The USB info:
The Apex Ultimate Striker Block Kit was designed to work in conjunction with our Hard Sear. The geometry and dimensions of our striker safety plunger differs from the factory part to yield a exceptionally smooth takeup before the trigger bar engages the sear cam. Our design also minimizes drag on the trigger bar as it transitions to the reset point. The secondary benefit is a more detectable trigger reset.

The striker safety plunger is made of heat treated 17-4 ph stainless steel  for wear resistance and mirror polished for minimal drag. The kit also includes a reduced power plunger spring that maintains the necessary safety values while reducing drag and lift resistance

543,http://www.armslist.com/posts/492543,For Sale:  Colt Lightening Rifle Medium Frame .32-20 Made in 1889,"Kingman, Arizona, United States",$ 690,"Listed On: Friday, December 21, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is my Colt Lightening Rifle serial number 39,XXX built in 1889  .  I bought this in early 2003 at Ruff's Guns and Liquor (They have since changed the name to Ruff's Guns, I loved it that they sold both guns and liquor in the same shop!) in Flagstaff, AZ.  I was told at time of purchase that it had come from a local estate sale and that is all I was told about it.  I was pretty excited when I found it and bought it for use in cowboy action shooting  (It was fun to see the looks on the faces of people at the shoots that I had a real vintage Colt Lightening and was shooting it in competition and not a reproduction.)  It is a medium frame model and is in .32-20 caliber, which is a pleasure to load and shoot.  It has a 21 inch octogon barrel and the curved steel butt plate.  This rifle does have some issues that I want any potential buyers to be aware of.  First, the bore quaility is poor.  It is worn and the bore is slightly pitted and it leads up quickly.  It worked fine for close up cowboy targets, but at longer ranges its accuracy was poor.  Second, the stock is cracked where it meets the rear of the reciever.  It has had what looked like a poorly done old repair that is holding, but not very good.  Third, is the finish.  The outside of this rifle looks as if it had been in a scabbard its whole working life, and it does look like it was a working ranch rifle by the marks and dings it has.  Its best atribute is that the action is solid!  I took it completely apart and did a detailed cleaning and inspection when I bought it and the inside is great.  The action is crisp and solid with no slop what so ever.  The springs have good strength and it loads and fires as it should.  I had planned on replacing the wood, having the barrel sleeved but I ended up finding another Lightening in .38-40 that I now use.  Feel free to contact me about any questions you have about the rifle. I tried to place more pictures of the rifle on this listing, but they were too large and I couldn't put them on here.  So if you need more pictures I can email them to you."

This is a brand new, never been fired Kel-Tec KSG bullpup 12-gauge pump action shotgun designed by Kel-Tec.   The KSG ejects casings downward rather than forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 pounds and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1-inch overall length and an 18.5-inch cylinder bore barrel.

The internal dual tube magazines hold 14 rounds of 12 gauge 2-3/4-inch shotshells (7 per tube). The pump action feeds from either the left or right tube.
 Each tube holds a total of seven 2.75 in (70 mm) 12-gauge shotshells or six 3 in (76 mm) shotshells.

The Kel-Tec KSG shotgun is a manually operated, pump (slide) action weapon. Barrel locking is achieved by a swinging wedge, located inside the top of the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. The sliding forend is connected to the bolt by dual operating bars. The ammunition feed is from two independent tubular magazines, located below the barrel.

The user is required to manually select a magazine by switching a three-position lever, located behind the pistol grip. The middle position of the switch blocks the feed from both magazines and allows the user to chamber a single round manually. Switching the lever to one side brings the respective magazine into the feed cycle. Once one magazine is depleted, the user manually switches to the second magazine by pushing the magazine selection lever toward it.[2]

Rounds are loaded into the magazines through a large loading/ejection port, located at the bottom of the gun in the stock, behind the pistol grip. Empty shells are ejected down through the same port. A manual safety is available in the form of the cross-bolt button, located above the grip, making the gun fully ambidextrous in use. Sighting equipment (iron sights and/or red dot sights) can be installed using the standard Picatinny rail located above the barrel. An second Picatinny rail is provided at the bottom of the sliding forend, permitting installation of other Picatinny rail accessories. While not included with the stock weapon, perpendicular forward grips and back-up iron sights (BUIS) are almost always shown in photography and video demonstrations of the Kel-Tec KSG"

Included with this sale is the Rifle, Scope, Larue Tactical LT135 quick detach mount and two 20 round magazines.

The original box for the scope is included, but I do not have any of the rifle's original packaging.  For an extra $40 I will include a rifle bag in the sale.

The rifle is in great condition aside from a some very minor dents and scratches on the rails which do not affect the operation in any way.  Pictures of this damage will be included.  One of the magazines also has a small crack on the top of the feed lip, but still functions perfectly.

The SCAR 17 is a piston operated semi automatic rifle chambered in 7.62x51 NATO and .308 win.  Because of the piston operation it is an extremely clean running rifle and while it requires very little cleaning after use, I have always cleaned it.

I am selling this rifle to buy some upgrades for my new Jeep, so unless you are the owner of a wheel/tire or offroad equipment store I will not be interested in any trades.

I will only accept Cash (FTF only) or USPS Money Order as payment (the money order must be verified by the Post Office before I will transfer the rifle.  If we meet face to face it will have to be at the post office so that I can verify the funds).  For out of state buyers, the USPS Money Order must clear and include shipping.  I will ship the rifle out immediately after.

Wisconsin buyers must have a Wisconsin Concealed Carry Permit that matches their ID and be willing to sign a bill of sale or a non-permit holder must be willing to have transfer completed by an FFL (my local FFL will do the transfer for $25)."

Seekins Precision iRMT-R Upper Receiver

Seekins Precision’s Integrated Rail Mounting technology (iRMT) uppers integrate the rail mounting points into the upper retaining the stiffness of a true monolithic upper while allowing the rails to be completely modular. This new upper design is considerably thicker in the most critical area and will aid in squeezing all of the potential accuracy out of your rifle. Instead of a standard barrel nut our iRMT system uses an externally threaded, Titanium barrel nut with 1-1/8” wrench flats on it for simple installation. No special proprietary wrenches needed.

11.5"" 1:7 Twist, Cold Hammer Forged Lightweight M249 CL HP MP Barrel w/ .625"" diameter gas block seat

These Amazing CHF barrels are extremely durable with a 20,000+ round service life. These CHF barrels are turned to ST's lightweight barrel Profile. It weighs 18oz with M4 Barrel extension and no FSB on the 11.5"" Barrel. The barrels have a .625"" gas block seat with a properly sized gas port and the muzzle is threaded perfectly concentric with 1/2x28 threads. These CHF barrels are made to the Mil-Spec for the M249 SAW. The Cold Hammer Forging process Work Hardens the steel around a rifled mandrel, which creates the lands and grooves. These barrels are chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 Twist Rate. The barrel blanks are the correct Certified CMV material and they are also Hard Chrome lined to the M249 SAW Mil-Spec, which is almost twice as thick as the Hard Chrome on a Mil-Spec M4. The End Result is a Rifle that can be Run Hard Day after Day! Each barrel is HPT and MPI. They have Mil-Spec M4 barrel extensions, Mil-Spec Phosphate finish on the outside.

Spike's Tactical Dynacomp Extreme

Spike's Tactical Dynacomp Extreme muzzle break reduces felt recoil and helps combat muzzle climb. These muzzle breaks are Manufactured 303 Stainless Steel and feature a Melonited black finish for wear resistance from high volume shooting. Machined to be completely concentric, included threading, not taped after the fact. The ports are ball dimpled for optimal expansion of gases and heat dissipation. The Dynacomp's are also long enough to extend your 14.5"" barrel to an ATF acceptable 16"", and will include a properly sized hardened pin for permanent mounting, includes crush washer for mounting.

Threaded for 1/2x28” barrels
Machined from 303 Stainless Steel
Black Melonite finish

Spikes Tactical 12"" BAR Rail

The Spike's Tactical 12” BAR Rail is a 1pc free floating quad-rail that’s machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum with a barrel nut machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and finished in type III Hardcoat Anodizing on the rail and barrel nut. The main benefit of the BAR rail is to those who wish to have a suppressor inside of the rail or for those shooters who have large bear paw hands and who feel that skinnier rails are just too small ( the BAR is about the same circumference as a DD rail with the popular Magpul XTM covers). The 12” BAR rail weighs in at 479 grams (16.89 oz.) and has an ID of 1.79”.

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling.

But wait, there’s more! The BAR has 5 built in QD sockets (sling attachment points), allows for a continuous top rail, it’s compatible with many low profile gas blocks, and it’s made right here in the USA and backed by our LIFETIME WARRANTY.

Vltor .625 Set Screw Gas Block

With the various rail systems currently being offered for the AR15/M16/M4 weapon systems, the Vltor Low-Profile Gas Block is small enough to fit inside most rail systems. The Vltor Low-Profile Gas Block covers one-inch of the barrels surface and is made to the tightest tolerance. These gas blocks are offered in 17-4PH stainless steel."

It will destroy deer and drop coyotes where they stand! I will consider trades but they must be worth my time. $1050 cash or $1300 in trade. I have reduced my asking price by over $150. I could really use the cash for the down payment on the purchase of a new truck. You will not find a nicer 6.8 at this price.

This is a stock Ruger 10 22 receiver, barrel, and trigger group.  I have put about 25-30 hours of work into this build and bedded this perfectly... I used a Arch Angel Sparta stock that is meant for a Mini 14 and customized it to allow this Ruger to drop right in.  I also customized 2 P mags with 10 round Ruger mages to fit perfectly as well.  Here is the list of what I have in this thing as well as pics showing the progress.

New in the box.  This pistol has an all black finish with a Red Star near the muzzle on both sides of the pistol and it comes with two 16 round mags. It has glow in the dark sights, not Tritium. There is a Soviet hammer and sickle laser engraved on the right hand side of the frame above the grip. The trigger pull appears to be similar to the original Cold War era hefty East Bloc trigger pull.

It has a well executed design, special attention to production tolerances, a steel magazine housing and follower and a proprietary HK ""Maritime"" anticossosion coating. It is considered by users in elite US military and law enforcement units as the best AR-15/M-16/M4 magazine in the world. In US military testing, the HK magazine improved feeding reliability by 30-50% overall. The Maritime coating easily surpasses the US MIL-STD-810 E salt fog test. During this test the magazines were exposed to a 100 hour salt fog and then stored three days at ambient temperature. After this procedure each magazine was fully loaded and fired twice with no problems. The superior function was validated during three separate tests by the British MoD in arctic, jungle, and desert environments during the firing of more than 1/2 million rounds. *Note: This magazine has the following markings: 5.56 x 45 Restricted Law Enforcement/Government Use Only 10-94; Heckler & Kock GmbH - Made in Germancy; Heckler & Koch Inc.

Training consists of instruction, hands on training and firing of handguns in a safe, professional setting. I provide the training, handguns and ammo. Informative, as well as fun! Whether you are a novice or want to further your training. Retired military instructor who will train you until both YOU and I are satisfied and confident!

This is a Beretta Model 3901 Youth Target RL 12 gauge semi-auto 

shotgun. The Beretta part number is J390Y18. It is a factory new 

gun, with original box and owners manual.

This shotgun is specifically designed for the needs of smaller 

stature shooters. The 3901 Target RL is the ideal first shotgun 

for new, youth, lady, or smaller stature shooters who desire to 

shoot 12 gauge, but require the additional benefit of a gas 

operating system to reduce recoil. This 12 gauge 3” chambered, 

semi-automatic has a 28” barrel. The barrel comes equipped with 

a Sporting style flat rib with steel front bead and mid-bead. 

The standard walnut stock and forearm are finished in a satin 

matte finish. The gun has an adjustable length of pull from 12” 

– 13”. The stock is also adjustable for cast on/off and comes 

equipped with Beretta’s Memory System II™ to adjust the parallel 

comb. Through the use of supplied magazine plugs, the capacity 

of the gun can be configured to a single shot if so desired for 

teaching applications. The gun weighs 7.2 lbs. MSRP is $950. 

Buyer pays $30.00 shipping (48 states). This gun can be shipped 

to an FFL dealer or to anywhere you want me to mail it to for 

transfer, subject to all local laws. US sales only, no exports.

I purchased this gun only a few weeks ago but am in need of the money and so am trying to sell it. The place that I purchased it at has a no-return policy on guns unless there is a defect (which there is not). My gun has NEVER been fired. In fact, I have not even taken the tag off of it. I also purchased #40 50cal rounds which I will include. The gun still has the original case, locks, and everything that it came with. I bought everything for $1,323 and still have the original receipt from a few weeks ago. I don't want to sell it for much less then what I bought it for b/c as I said it is literally brand new from just a few weeks ago, but I would be willing to negotiate a fair price. I was also told by the gun salesman that Smith and Wesson is going to be increasing their prices in August and so this gun will be more expensive to buy in the upcoming weeks.
