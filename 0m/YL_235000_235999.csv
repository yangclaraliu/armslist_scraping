The blade is 16 1/2 inches in length with a cutting edge of almost 15 inches. The overall length of the M-1917 bayonet is 21 3/4 inches. The blade has original blade edge and shows no sign of rusting or modifications. This bayonet has not been drilled for the ""clearing hole"" in the end of the stud slot to allow dirt or debris to be removed from the end of the slot. This was done fairly early in production, probably in October or November of 1917. Some of the earlier bayonets were retrofitted with this hole, so US marked M1917 bayonets without the clearing hole are fairly uncommon."

Driver License number - if a number isn't provided one will be genericlly generated

                      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Halfass pic = Halfass ID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Picture:  *Passport Photos Are The Easiest To Work With.  Scanned passport pictures are ideal to work with and you can obtain them at 

many retail locations. Do not use old license images. They are small and the background cannot be edited. Also they usually contain old 

security lines or holograms over the face. 
*This is very important and can make the difference between having the authenticity of your fake license questioned or not. LOOK at your 

license and study it. LOOK at the image you want on your fake id, and use your best judgment if it would be feasible. If you have to take 

photos yourself, be very cautious that you are looking into the camera at the correct angle. Be very cautious of the color of your face. Web 

cameras with a blue hue to your face from being in front of the computer are not good. Minor issues like red eye, and editing the brightness 

and contrast can be fixed. Images are better when taken inside. After all, the license bureau does not take you outside to take your picture, 

so why would you use an outside image for your fake id?

Please forward order information to: e-mail at: DetailedImages@anonymousspeech.com. Attach photo/s and signature to the e-mail.  Once 

order email is received, you will receive reply w/payment instructions. Once your payment is confirmed, ID/s will be started.  Once ID is 

completed, you will receive an image/s via email of the final product/s to ensure customer satisfaction.

********Replicas Soon to be Announced - PA, CT, KY, old AZ, OH, old MI, HI


Information required to complete *most IDs is as follows:

Name - First, Middle Initial, Last 
Address
Date of birth
Sex, Height, Weight, Eye color
Driver License number - if a number isn't provided one will be genericlly generated
(I also can provide the FOR IDENTIFICATION ONLY style ID if requested)  
Endorsements and/or Restrictions - if not included these will be left blank 
Scanned signature - if not provided you will recieve a generic signature
Scanned passport picture - no webcam pictures can be accepted. Remember your ID will only look as good as the pic you present. 

*Depending upon needed ID more information may be required

                      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Halfass pic = Halfass ID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Picture:  *Passport Photos Are The Easiest To Work With.  Scanned passport pictures are ideal to work with and you can obtain them at 

many retail locations. Do not use old license images. They are small and the background cannot be edited. Also they usually contain old 

security lines or holograms over the face. 
*This is very important and can make the difference between having the authenticity of your fake license questioned or not. LOOK at your 

license and study it. LOOK at the image you want on your fake id, and use your best judgment if it would be feasible. If you have to take 

photos yourself, be very cautious that you are looking into the camera at the correct angle. Be very cautious of the color of your face. Web 

cameras with a blue hue to your face from being in front of the computer are not good. Minor issues like red eye, and editing the brightness 

and contrast can be fixed. Images are better when taken inside. After all, the license bureau does not take you outside to take your picture, 

so why would you use an outside image for your fake id?

Please forward order information to: e-mail at: DetailedImages@anonymousspeech.com. Attach photo/s and signature to the e-mail.  Once 

order email is received, you will receive reply w/payment instructions. Once your payment is confirmed, ID/s will be started.  Once ID is 

completed, you will receive an image/s via email of the final product/s to ensure customer satisfaction.

Please use PGP with all correspondence. Attempts to contact without encryption will be ignored.

I have searched for this rifle made in this year for a long time. Occasionally you will find a BDL Custom Deluxe in random calibers, but never with the engravings and rarely in this great caliber. If you are an outdoorsman this is one you will never want to let go.  I don't, but I have no choice.

Offered for your consideration is one (1), Offered for your consideration is one (1) Mossberg 146B .22 rimfire caliber, “T” bolt action rifle. This model was manufactured in the years of 1949 thru 1954. It features the “T” bolt design which was only manufactured for a very short period of time. This Mossberg is complete and seems all original with the exception of the front sight hood, which is a high quality reproduction of the original one. I would rate the overall condition of this rifle as Good to Good+ with some very minor bluing loss and very shallow pitting on the bottom of the magazine tube and just in front of the ejection port. These areas can be clearly seen in the pictures. Additional pictures upon request for serious buyers.

Offered for your consideration is one (1), Mossberg No.46 .22 caliber bolt action rifle. Manufactured during the years of 1935 thru 1937 it features the No. 4 receiver peep sight, and 1A ramp front sight. There were no barrel sights for this rifle, however, it is factory drilled & tapped to accept the Mossberg side scope mount of the period. Considering its’ age, this No.46 is in remarkable condition. With the exception of the gold bead in the 1A front sight and front sight hood, (which are can be seen in the pictures), it is complete. The aperture for the No.4 receiver peep sight is a high quality reproduction of the original one for a No. 4 peep sight. On some models of the 46 the the Mossberg 4A receiver peep sight is found which has the 4A aperture from which the shooter can select one of four different size apertures to use. The receiver peep sight on this rifle is the standard Mossberg No.4 peep sight. The walnut stock has no cracks or splits; however, there are several shallow depressions on the bottom of the beavertail forend. These can also be seen in the pictures. Additional pictures available upon request for serious inquiries.

Preferable I would like a 9mm but would look at other calibers. 

She is in very nice and well loved condition throughout, only showing light handling marks, mostly confined to the forearm. Probable one of the cleanest I have ever seen for this age.  As with all Browning A5 16 gauges of this age, it was originally manufactured for 2 9/16 shotgun shells that were popular in Europe at the time. It was converted by Browning to accept the now-standard 2-3/4"" shells. 

Operates/cycles flawlessly; I still use her for a rabbit and skeet gun, even took her out last weekend. The Receiver and Bore are in excellent condition and she has the hard to find “suicide/sliding safety”. (This was the sliding safety that goes front-back through the trigger guard.)

I would be more than happy to spend some time with who ever I trade with, go over the correct way to break her down, how to set up the gas rings for shot size and tips/tricks that some old timers taught me along the way. I also have a copy of the original manual that might come in handy. These older Browning A5’s were incredible hand made firearms; even the assemble screws were proof tested and marked. The wood is hand checkered, no cracks and in truly awesome condition. She is the perfect heirloom gun if you’re looking for a “safe queen”, or is ready for every day use. Operates the same way she did 85 years ago, and really feels good in your hands."

Offered for your consideration is one (1), Offered for your consideration is one (1) Mossberg 352KA .22 Semi-Auto Rifle. This model was made from the years 1960 thru 1971. Due to the absence of a serial number, it would indicate that this specimen was manufactured prior to the 1968 Gun Control Act which required all firearms to bear a unique serial number. This little Mossberg was a popular favorite of small game hunters and beginning shooters. It features a black plastic fold down forend, factory installed sling swivels, 10 round magazine and open sights. I would rate the overall condition of this Mossberg to be Very Good to Excellent.

Offered for your consideration is one (1), Mossberg Model 341 .22 Caliber Bolt Action Rifle. There is some confusing data as to the years of manufacture of this Mossberg. Since it has no serial number, it seems to have been manufactured prior to the 1968 Gun Control Act. It features a Monte Carlo stock with cheek piece, sling swivels, the S320 ramp front sight and the No. 4505 rear sight. It is in what I consider to be very good+ to excellent condition showing only the smallest of handling marks and indications of actual use. This Mossberg was one of Mossberg’s last models of American made .22 caliber rifles and would make a excellent rifle for the beginner shooter, or for that matter, a very nice small game rifle for just about anyone. Additional pictures available upon request for serious inquiries.

Offered for your consideration is one (1), Mossberg 151K .22 L. R. caliber, semi-automatic rifle. Made in the years of 1950 thru 1951 this Mossberg is in what I would consider excellent condition for its’ age. With the exception of the scuff in the bluing on top of the barrel, (shown in the pictures), it has only the very faintest handling marks and a tiny area of freckling, (also shown in the pictures), between the front of the receiver and the back of the rear sight. This Mossberg would make a very nice addition/upgrade to a Mossberg collection, or for that matter, a wonderful rifle for a experienced, or beginning, shooter/hunter.

NOTE: Make sure that this firearm is legal to own in your state and/or locality.

Offered for your consideration is one (1), Mossberg 144LSB / .22 Caliber Bolt Action Rifle. This 144 LSB was the last generation of the Mossberg 144 series to be produced. The years of production were 1979 thru 1985. This specimen is in outstanding condition and shows virtuously little signs of being used. In fact, in my humble opinion, it is as close as one could get to being almost like new considering that production of this rifle stopped over 25 years ago. It features a handsomely stained Beech stock, Mossberg S331 receiver peep sight, Lyman 17A globe front sight. This front sight features the ability to change the inserts to anyone of seven in a kit that is available from sources such as Brownell’s. Also featured are front & rear sling swivels, and adjustable hand stop with integral sling swivel. It is chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge and has a seven round detachable magazine. Please note that what may appear to be a ring of some sort on the bottom of the barrel in picture 7 is only the imprint of the rubber pad that it rested against in the gun carousel. Also, what appear to be scratches in picutre 10 showing the area of the roll mark on top of the barrel was some type of white like material which I easily rubbed off with a plain cloth. I would rate the overall condition of this rifle as excellent with only the faintest of handling marks, mainly on the stock. Additional pictures available upon request for serious inquiries.

Offered for your consideration is one (1), Mossberg 42M (c) / .22 Cal. bolt action rifle / C&R. Manufactured in the years of 1947 thru 1950 this Mossberg features a two piece Mannlicher stock with cheek piece, pistol grip, and trapdoor butt plate, (repaired), for storing an extra magazine; twenty-three inch barrel; detachable sling swivels (not present); 7 round magazine; S107 barrel sight; S106 ramp front sight; and S100 receiver peep sight (not present). It was, and continues to be, a favorite shooter and small game rifle among many sportsmen. Its’ short, compact size, males it a ideal choice for most any shooting related venture. I would rate the overall condition of this rifle as Very Good with only minor finish wear to the metal and stock with no corrosion on the metal. There is, as seen in the pictures, a very tight crack on the upper edge of the forend on the left side. This should be easily repairable if one chooses to do so but should not be a problem what so ever if left as is. Additional pictures available upon request for serious inquiries.

Factory New Kel-Tec PF9 / 9X19m/m (Luger) Caliber  

NOTE: Make sure that this firearm is legal to own in your state and/or locality.

Offered for your consideration is one (1), factory new Kel-Tec PF9 chambered in the very popular 9X19m/m (Luger) Caliber. This is the original version of this fine pistol which Ruger has copied with a few minor differences and markets as their LC9. In the latest issue of Gun Tests magazine, the staff who tested and evaluated both pistols favored the Kel-Tec PF9 over the Ruger LC9 for several consumer related issues. The two main, and can possibly be, the main reasons is the disparity in weight,(the Ruger LC9 weighs several ounces more empty that does the Kel-Tec9 PF9) and the manufacturer’s suggested retail price of (MSRP) each. At the suggested retail level, the Ruger LC9 is priced $110.00 more that the Kel-Tec PF9. In the opinion of the Gun Tests testing staff, and in my opinion as well, they are the exact same pistol with a few minor additions to the Ruger LC9.

The P220 Compact is a 6+1 capacity pistol featuring enhanced ergonomics and true concealability in the powerful .45 Auto platform. The shortened frame provides concealability while the ergonomically contoured magazine floorplate lengthens the grip just enough to provide a firm grip for even large handed shooters. The hard coat anodize alloy frame combines light weight and strength for extreme durability. The integrated accessory rail ensures compatibility with industry standard options, such as our STL-900L Tactical Light & Laser. Topping the compact frame is a shorter, commander-length stainless slide housing a 3.9 in cold hammer forged barrel and external extractor, for enhanced reliability. Like all P220 pistols, the Compact features a rock solid lock up and superb out-of-the-box accuracy. In a world full of concealed carry options, the P220 Compact's improved ergonomics, slim profile and shorter slide and frame make the pistol the ideal choice.

Practice pieces are divided into small sections allowing the student to learn a step at a time. And that's not all; the LK-220 has plenty more to offer, including the new AHL sound source boasting 48 notes of polyphony, 150 rhythms, an extended automatic accompaniment feature with ON-bass chord and a large, easy-to-read display. The sampling function provides hours of fun: recordings from the mic input of up to a second can be played back via the keyboard.

The LK-220 features a ""Step Up Lesson"" feature that helps you to do just that. The built-in songs are pre-divided into phrases to help you master keyboard play. Step Up Lesson takes you through practice of the right hand part, left hand part, and both hand parts for each phrase of a song. Master all of the phrases and you master the song.

Built-In Sampling

They installed the quad rail. I put the Troy pistol grip and SLAP plate on. The sling is a 1-2 point TacStrap and works really nice. The scope is a Bushnell Elite 3200 3-10 power and the mount is a Burris PEPR. All of these parts were purchased when I got the rifle. It also has Samson flip up sights with the Spikes logo on them. The foregrip is a Magpul.The ladder rail covers I just painted a OD to break up the black a little bit. I also have the stock pistol grip to go with it. I have shot MAYBE 100 rounds through it with zero problems at all. Shoots like a dream. The scope could use a little more dialing in though, it's close, but I didn't have a good rest to fine tune it.

This is my personal gun, but since I am an FFL holder, paperwork will have to be done. Must have a PTP. I was going to use this as an all purpose rifle, and hopefully take out a few coyotes along the way. Decided I'm going to go another direction, wish I could keep it, I really love this gun! This thing is as close to new as you will find. Comes in the Spikes Tactical hard case that's in the picture. Everything in the pic is included for this price.

If you are interested in just the upper, maybe we can work out a deal.

If you have any questions, or would like specific pictures, feel free to ask. Thanks.

The Saiga-12 self-loading smooth bored shotgun is intended for professional and sport hunting of small-and medium-size game under any climatic conditions.


This shotgun is built on the famous AK-47 action that has been proven by years of very reliable combat action!


The shotgun comes with 12-ga. smooth bored barrel and the chamber which accepts the ammo equipped with shot or slugs including ""Magnum"" cartridges with
70mm (2-3/4"") and 76 mm (3"") cartridge case.


The shotgun is used to deliver single shots. It is reloaded automatically due to the energy of powder combustion gases bled from the barrel bore through the barrel port. The shotgun may be equipped with a sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation, which makes zeroing and firing at moving targets more convenient. The gas motive unit is adjustable to match the parameters of internal ballistics inherent to the standard cartridges and ""Magnum"" cartridges, as well. For the purpose of diversifying operational capabilities the shotgun may be equipped with muzzle adapters of different chokes, including the muzzle adapter ""Paradox"". (IZHMASH)"

676,http://www.armslist.com/posts/235676,For Sale:  Partially machined AR 15 lower receiver forging,"SW, Springfield, Missouri",$ 55,"Listed On: Tuesday, December 13, 2011",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale I have a few partially machined AR 15 lower receiver forgings.  These forgings have the most difficult machining functions already performed.  These functions would be the mag well, and the exterior profile.  These functions require expensive machine tools to perform correctly (EDM or broach for the magwell, cnc mill for the profile).  The take-down pin holes are machined as well, so you have great zero indicators should you choose to finish the lower yourself.  The remaining machining functions can be performed on a hand mill or lathe, or possibly even a drill press.  

I like these lower receivers for a few reasons.  First, I think finishing one would be a fun challenge.  They are completely blank, meaning I can engrave my own unique roll mark, as well as any other markings I want.  They are ""in the white"", meaning I can choose to anodize them in any custom color I want. The customization aspect is neat.  Personally, I think a lower receiver anodized in british racing green would be super cool:

The possibilities are endless.  The beauty of these is that you can make them however you want.  You get the idea:





Of course, you could also leave them just the way they are, and have a really neat decoration, discussion piece, gift idea, etc.

Since this is an unfinished receiver, it does not qualify as a legal firearm.  This means no paperwork is necessary.  As far as the law is concerned, it may as well be an aluminum baseball bat."

The firearm has been modified from its original color scheme. As seen in the photo, the bottom is duracoat green and the top slide is bare (requiring that you keep it clean and well oiled as it will rust if you allow it to. (Takes no more care than my Springfield 1911)).

These are the new triple reed design that Duck Commander gurantees not to stick. These calls have all had the special ""hand-tuned"" treatment from Phil Robertson himself. These calls sound great. I ordered 4 thinking some of the guys I hunt with would take them off my hands but they're dragging their feet and the last thing I wont is them taking them hunting and then not paying. Just trying to get some money back out of these other 3 since I only need 1. If you were to buy these new they would cost you $50 ($40 call price+$10 hand-tune) plus shipping or tax. So basically that would put you at $55-$60 total. I'll take $32 shipped each on these. Take this opportunity to save some money on a great call with great reviews on.
