This one is from factory 206 (not /26\ ) so it's hard to accurately determine it's age, but it's got a milled receiver, a large-lug threaded barrel, the longer gas-tube, a non-lightened bolt carrier and the side mounted sling, which are all trademarks of the original Tula clones. However, it does have a spike bayonet, which is where the Chinese started to differ from the Russian design. 

Anyway, it's a fun, accurate rifle and has been thuroughly cleaned and de-cosmoed. The metal is in great condition, and the stock has all of the expected dents and dings."

 Walther PPS is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses modified Browning type locking with tilting barrel. Frame of the gun is made from impact resistant polymer. Trigger is of double action only type, striker fired, with pre-cocked striker system, similar to QA system used in Walther P99 pistols. This system requires a manual recocking (by partial slide retraction) in the case of misfire. Gun is fitted with automated trigger safety and firing pin block; additional ""storage type"" safety is provided by removable backstrap of the grip; once backstrap is removed, the firing pin is automatically decocked and gun is blocked until the backstrap is reinstalled. This patented system is called QuickSafe by Walther. Sights are low profile, with rear sight adjustable for windage."

The gun has not been modified and is in very good condition. I will tell you straight up that it will not fire cheap ammo such as Sellier and Belloit or Olympic due to excessively hard primers in those rounds. You can search the web for information on light strikes on those brands of ammo and see what I mean. I have been shooting Federal Hollow points with no problems as well as Remington. The Diamondback DB9 I just purchased will not fire those rounds either. The pocket holster pictured comes with it, it is a $10 holster but fits perfectly. Great handgun for the price.

    One hard rifle case

Walther P22 - $300

This Walther P22 is a 2011 model. I used this as a low cost training pistol for my Walther P99, but recently sold that. It's a great pistol to train with cheaper ammo costs, great for the girls, and great for the kids to shoot. It comes with the following:

    Original Walther hard case
    Original paperwork, manuals, and safety lock
    Interchangeable backstraps for palm swell
    One factory 10-round magazine and three 10-round early P22 magazines.

AR-15 - $850

I built this rifle a couple months ago after a little saving, planning, and purchasing the right parts for it. It's got a 24"" barrel and shoots extremely flat and accurate. It would make a great hunting rifle because it's so accurate at all ranges. It comes with the following:

    One 30-round Magpul P-Mag
    30 rounds of .223 ammo
    24"" Bushmaster heavy barrel chambered in 5.56/.223 with a 1:9 twist
    16"" Olympic Arms free float rail
    Rifle length gas system
    Fake suppressor for a flash hider
    MP marked bolt
    Keyhole forged A2 upper receiver
    Two Tango Down rail covers
    Four DPMS rail covers
    Knights Armament style vertical foregrip
    Switch operated LED tactical light

AR-15 - $950

This one is built in the more traditional 16"" fashion. It's a lightweight contour chrome-lined barrel and functions great as a home defense rifle due to the light weight, shorter length, Surefire LED tactical light, and visible green laser for quick offhand shots. I've personally seen the laser shine over a mile on a clear night. The bolt carrying group has had a chrome coating applied to reduce friction, increase reliability, and make cleaning easier. It comes with the following:

    One 30-round Magpul P-Mag
    30 rounds of .223 ammo
    16"" lightweight barrel chambered in 5.56/.223 with a 1:9 twist and chrome lining
    12"" free float rail
    Yankee Hill Machine Phantom flash hider
    midlength gas system
    Square forged A3 upper receiver
    Laser etched T-marks
    M4 feed ramps
    Surefire G2 Nitrolon with a high lumen LED upgrade
    High power pressure switch operated visible green laser
    Chrome coated bolt carrying group
    Surefire rubber rail covers
    Tango Down style vertical foregrip
    Magpul angled foregrip
    Magpul MBUS rear sight

As for lower receivers I have a low serial number Stag Arms lower receiver and two consecutive serial number Palmetto State Armory lower receivers. You can choose any combination of two for the rifles if you buy both rifles, but if you buy just one it's $20 extra dollars for the Stag Arms. Lower receivers will come fully assembled to mil-specifications with CAR stocks.

On Wednesday March 29,2006 Winchester in New Haven,Conn. sent it's employees home early and closed the plant.  Bringing about an end of an era in U.S. gun making.  2006 was also the first year that Winchester brought out the 94 Legacy to their new catalog for that year.  Thus, only about 500 of these guns were produced during those short months.  Here is your chance to own a true piece of history with this rifle being absolutely one of the last ones to be produced in the United States.  

It features a round 26"" barrel, a finely checkered walnut stock and long-style forearm, a factory included, adjustable Marble’s® rear tang sight and a case-colored steel receiver. Notice the nostalgic curved buttplate, preferred by cowboys and range riders for more than 100 years. Chambered in 38-55 Win. Each rifle has been carefully designed for comfortable balance and accurate shooting.  Factory drilled and tapped for scope mounts. Case Color reciever, Tang Safety, 26"" round Barrel, 38/55 with the original box. Made in New Haven, Conn. USA. 

Being the original owner of this rifle, I have fired it and thus will sell it as used.  But this rifle has been babied it's entire life.  Regretably the original manual has been lost but comes with it's original box and included accessories such as the lock and hammer thumb screw, ect.  Also included with the purchase I will include what ammo, bullets, brass and dies that I have for the 38-55. I am placing a value of $900 for this rifle but I've seen them going for much more.  This rifle is sure to only increase in value.  Please see below for items I would be interested in trading for as well.  Please feel free to contact me at 501-732-six 7 five 7"

If you can beat my price then god bless ya. NO CHICAGO SALES. I don't care what some of you people say. I've looked into the law and have talked to Chicago cops. If I sell my gun to a Chicago resident and the Chicago resident does not do his/her part and register the firearm in his/her name and in the event that the firearm is used in a crime, then I'm ultimately fuc*ed because the firearm is still in my name. Call your local CPD Police station if you don't believe me."

Running like a champ now! This model in 9mm is very hard to find in stores. Every dealer I talked to said it's a 6 month wait to order new one's from Kimber. 

I'm the original owner, gently used (only blue showing slightest wear is near take down), well maintained and lubed after each range session. Only 250 rounds through it, most of which while getting it dialed to find the best magazine. This gun is a tack driver! If you miss, it's your fault.  It's what sold me on buying this gun: the accuracy is amazing.

4 inch barrel (great for conceal carry), night sights, front checkering, ambi safety. All Specs on the gun can be found on the Kimber factory website.

In this package deal here, I will include the 1911 ($1188 value new), VZ Grips in ETC Dirty Olive G10 ($69 value), 3 Tripp Research Mags - holds 10 rounds! ($35 each = $105 value), Remora IWB Holster with full sweat and tuckable options ($47 value), plus all original hardware (case, original Kimber mag, take down tool, child safety lock, plus original wood grips). All this new would cost you $1,409.00 plus shipping and FFL fees!

My offer, $1,100 for everything. Or $1,000 for stock gun, without aftermarket grips, mags, and holster. Basically what you would get from the store: Gun, Stock Case, 1 Kimber mag, stock wood grips. 

FTF preferably with Bill of Sale in or around Houston, but willing to travel. I also have a Texas CHL, and would prefer it if you did too if we are doing FTF. I travel to Beaumont often for work, and Dallas on occasion. Regardless of the region, If you are seriously interested, I will even meet you at a shooting range so you can shoot it yourself if you would like. Why am I willing to go out of my way for FTF? I'm confident you will enjoy shooting this one. 

I can also ship to your FFL from my FFL if we are too far apart.  Thanks for looking!"

This gun has 2 3/4"" Chambers. This gun is a horse of a different color. While it is a DE Grade, it was completed by Savage Arms in the late 30's. There is NO card on this gun. I do have it from a very reliable source from the Fox Collectors Assocation that this gun is a DE Grade and not a slapped together parts gun. During the Savage era there were several guns completed where the cards on them are now lost. Looks like this is one of them. While it may not be a collectors gun in the classic sense, this one sure is a quality gun that lives up to the Fox name. The gun has the Single Selective Kaytzky trigger. I've never had one problem with this trigger. The ejectors are strong and timed and again, not one problem. This gun has been restocked and work was done by Dennis Potter, so you know it's quality work! There are no dings, dents or handling marks on the stock, save one small one on the left side of the stock. The 28"" barrels, which are 4 weight, are choked Lt Modified/Improved Modified (.013/.026). The bores are mirror bright with a wall thickness of Left .043 and Right .038. The barrel blue is at 99% with no marks at all on it. The barrels have front and middle Ivory beads. The Case Colors are also 99% with sharp crisp engraving. The gun is tight and on face. The stock dimensions are 1 3/4 DAH and 1 1/2 DAC. LOP is 14"" to the end of the checkered butt. Weight is a very balanced 6lbs 15oz. This is one nice gun with not one problem. It is also in near perfect cosmetic condition as well. $40.00 Shipping to your FFL.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.  I have plenty of pictures available upon request. Always happy to help! Thanks for looking!! Greg"

968,http://www.armslist.com/posts/446968,For Sale/Trade:  Webley Mark I Revolver - .45 Cal,"Dayton, Dayton, Ohio",$ 375,"Listed On: Monday, June 25, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale/trade is a Webley Mark I revolver, Not a Mark I* or I**, so this is an example of the earliest model of Webley.
Some minor pitting in places but no obvious surface rust. Blued finish.
Lockup seems to be tight.
Proof marks everywhere..serial number of ""1022"" and all the serial numbered parts match.

It's been shaved for .45 ACP use(with moon clips) rather than the original .455 Webley cal. The very bottom edge of the serial numbers on the rear face of the cylinder are missing and the cylinder face has no proof marks on it at all.
I think the the barrel has been cut and the front sight moved. Looks to be a pretty good job if so. I understand that the barrel cutting and shaved cylinders were pretty common when they were imported to make them more palatable to the US market as the original .455 Webley cal wasn't really available here.

The star extractor does not snap back into place when you open the gun, the extractor stays in the ""up"" position until you start to close the gun, then it lowers. I have not disassembled it so it could be just dirt/gunk. The gun can still be loaded/fired regardless. 

UPDATE - Ive had numerous emails from other Webley owners that it's most likely dirt/gunk causing the above. You'll mileage may vary..I'll leave it to the new owner.

The Mark I Webleys were last made in the 1890's, so since it was made pre 1899, it can be bought/sold/mailed, etc. without a FFL as it's considered ""antique"". Includes brown leather holster. This is the epitome of the classic British pistol at the height of their empire. Or if you just want to look like Sherlock Holmes. The pictures are a little deceiving...this is a big, heavy pistol, with a huge .45 cal bore. :)

I'm looking to trade it outright for a modern firearm, or asking $375.00 cash/best offer. Please feel free to email with any questions or request pics of specific areas of the pistol. Thanks for looking."
