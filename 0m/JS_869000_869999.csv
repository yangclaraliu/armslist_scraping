The package includes an S series Yugoslavian PAP M 59/66A1 rifle manufactured in 1981 by Zasvata Arms, a Yugoslavian arms and artillery manufacturer, and the leading producer of firearms for the Yugoslav People's Army. Nicknamed the ""papovka"", which was short for ""Polu-automatska puska"" This rifle has the eleven inch folding blade style bayonet, an attached 22mm NATO spec grenade launcher complete with ladder sights, flip-up phosphorous night sights, butt stock cleaning kit, and a canvas sling with leather attachments. Additionally, this package includes one 30 round steel magazine which is NOS. Unique to the Yugoslavian SKS is the attached 22mm NATO spec grenade launcher. The gas system which allows this rifle to operate in a semi-automatic manner has a button located on top of the gas tube itself. When the grenade sight is raised the gas system automatically directs gas into the grenade launcher, thus launching your grenade. This grenade launching system is powered by 7.62x39 blank cartridges, of which ten are included with this collection. Additionally, you get one M1A2 rifle grenade adapter complete with one MK2 cast iron, antipersonnel, fragmentation grenade. This ""pineapple grenade"" is detachable from the launcher and was developed by the U.S. and used extensively in WWII as well as Viet Nam and other conflicts. Rounding out this collection, you will receive a leather two pocket ammo pouch, a leather oil can holder with oil bottle and oiler, a butt stock cleaning kit with brush and jag and an Inter Ordinance Yugoslavian M 59/66 manual. The rifle itself is in good condition, but shows some handling marks from its use. The bluing is very good and the rifle is free of rust or pitting. The bore looks shiny with strong lands and grooves. The phosphorus night sights have lost their luminescence, but both the rear as well as the fold up front sight are intact.

	The former Yugoslavia is a dynamic and interesting region of the world which is likely to continue to be the focus of geopolitical struggle. This is a wonderful opportunity to own a piece of history from a country which no longer exists. 

	This offering includes NO AMMO.

If you live in an area which limits magazine size to ten rounds, I can convert this rifle back to its original configuration and ten round magazine, which is pictured, but not included in this package. If I re-configure the rifle to accept this ten round magazine, the 30 round magazine will not be included. 

	I will not ship this package to areas of the country where it is illegal to own i.e. California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio, Puerto Rico and Washington DC. I DO NOT SHIP OUTSIDE OF THE
CONTINENTAL U.S.

Del-Ton kit built around an Aeroprecision lower.  I have put about 200 rounds through it without a hiccup.  It's a fairly standard 16"" flat top kit with adjustable stock and front post site.  It does have some upgraded internal trigger parts that make it a bit more smooth and slightly lighter than your standard AR trigger.  I will leave on the Tru Glo red/green dot sight and the magpul rear sight.  I will include a couple of 30 round magazines and a gun case.  

The only trade(partial) I would consider would be for a Glock 19 or Glock 26 and/or a cricket youth .22.  Glocks must have magazines and I will offer you fair market value in credit.  I might take some factory sealed powder, but only if it is Varget, BLC-2, 4895, 2495, 846, or RL15.

Rifle has a built-in 5 round magazine and has been outfitted with a Tasco 3-9X32 power scope. This Mauser has the desirable Colombian crest engraved just forward of the bolt. The Colombian's during the war were issued European 7mm Mausers in which they converted to the readily available American 30-06 round. This rifle would be the ultimate hunting rifle for the upcoming deer and elk season. There is one slight hiccup with the rifle though. Once the chambered round is fired, it is slightly difficult to open the bolt back up. (Some shots required the use of two hands to open the bolt) I've had the fired brass evaluated, and been told this is a head-spacing issue with the barrel, and that I myself, or a gunsmith, should fix this by replacing the barrel. Barrels from Midway or Brownells are running 80-90 dollars in any caliber of your choosing. I am not particularly interested in spending the time to get this rifle in perfect condition. I would like to add that it does shoot and operate as it should, just definitely not as smooth or safe as it should be. It is extremely accurate and was hitting clay pigeons at 200 yards last weekend. The action on this rifle is a European FN action and is highly sought after to be used in high-end custom sporterized rifles because it is fully capable of handling any round available; including the high powered 300 win mag or 300 weatherby rounds. I would prefer to actually trade. I'm looking for anything and everything. Shoot me a trade offer, the worst I can do is politely say ""no thanks."""

Please stop with the whining about price gouging. In case you have not read the national news, there is a nationwide run on guns, ammo and magazines. This has caused a drastic shortage of everything. Sure, go ahead and brag about how you can still get 5.56 ammo for .38 a round but all you have for that price is a nebulous promise without physically getting the product in hand.

If you want it NOW, you will have to pay the price increase that comes with getting it NOW and not in 6 months IF EVER once your backorder can finally get processed. 

If you bought enough excess stuff to sell it now at a profit - GREAT! Good thinking! Well done! If you didn't keep your head on a swivel and see this coming, you are then going to pay your stupid tax for it. 

Buck up and deal with it. Private gun owners are not an armory to distribute arms at reduced pricing out of some weird idea of good will. If the market bears a good price, then charge it. If you want to wait for 2 weeks or a year to get something at a good price, please go ahead and do that as well. No one has a gun to your head forcing you to buy anything on here. Go ahead and hit up your favorite gun shop and drool over the empty racks and shelves if you prefer.

Bought the lower kit and never put it together the lower kit has us made trigger components, rear stock block. And stock.  Needs a pivot pin and the plastic buffer piece or take it out of your usc piece when transferring.  This is a badass combo and you don't have to worry about rifle ammo.  It also has a Sightmark red dot sight on it but will need to be zeroed in.  I have $2500 in this kit so no I will not take $2000 for it because I don't have to get rid of it.  The only thing that needs to be done to my knowledge is upper receiver clearanced for grease gun mags.  Top notch can do it and many other places specialize in grease gun mag conversions.  922 r should not be a problem because all components are us made ( lower, mags, trigger parts, stock) may need a muzzle break/flash hider or at least a thread protector.

A Norinco folding stock sks. Finish is good but not flawless, everything works and shoots. These are damn near impossible to find and expensive to boot! Price is adjusted for inflation, not price-gouging. I saw one just like this one but with a cheap little bipod going for 1300 bucks and I laughed my ass off. In a time of price-gouging, this is my gift to you, the people of Armslist.

Non-matching numbers (because of the stock), but as far as I know, the rest of the parts are all original. No bayonet, but they can be had for cheap. Comes with (2) flawless 30 round detachable PMAGS, and a few different metal mags that vary in condition from serviceable to rough.

Also have a 2004 Yamaha Blaster in OK shape. Could use some new paint, but it runs like a champ. I don't have pictures at the time but I'll have them up by tomorrow."

Trades
-Quality AR-15 optics as a partial trade. Not looking for a scope more along the lines of an Aimpoint or eotech
-Ammo- 5.56/.223, 9mm, and .308 
-Would also consider a few handguns as partial trade. If trading for a handgun I would require to do face to face In Colorado. Might be interested in XD/XDM 9 compact, M&P 9mm, Taurus Judge, possibly a couple other compacts. 
If shipped you are responsible for knowing all state and federal laws. If face to face valid DL to prove your age is required if I question it and you must be legal to own a firearm. 

I had one buyer back out after I turned another potential buyer away so I wont hold the rifle the first person that can meet with the money will get it."

991,http://www.armslist.com/posts/869991,For Sale:  1873 Remington Model 2 Rolling Block Rifle (.38-40),"Ocala, Gainesville, Florida",$ 450,"Listed On: Thursday, January 17, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hi,
I am selling my Remington Model 2, rolling block, breech load rifle. It is chambered in .38-40 (.38W). It is technically a .40 caliber bullet, and .38-40 loads are still available should you want to shoot it. I advise using blackpowder cowboy action type loads if you intend on shooting it. I have not shot it and look at is more as a piece of American history and as decoration. 

The block and trigger do work properly. The original metal buttplate, barrel, and receiver all have matching serial numbers. The finish is worn but has a great patina that makes this a great wall-hanger. The barrel is worn and the receiver tang was re-welded a very long time ago, the tang is aligned properly with the receiver though and everything looks proper. There is one screw missing, but it does not seem to affect function in any way. The original front sight is present, but the rear sight is not. There are businesses online that deal in rolling block parts, so you could restore it with appropriate parts if you were so inclined. 

The original Remington stamp on the barrel is very crisp and looks great. The patent stamps with the dates are only minimally obscured, and you can read most of the dates clearly (1872 is the last date referenced). This gun was manufactured sometime after the last patent date, but would have been earlier than similar guns with later patent references. It was definitely made in the 1800's and is all original. 

I have seen similar rifles sell for $500-800 and pristine ones that go into the thousands of dollars. I am very reasonable and I am happy to entertain an offer. I will gladly take trades as well if it is something that interests me. Right now I am looking for a lever action (30-30, .357, .44, .45-70 would all work), a bolt action (preferably a Remington 700 in 30.06, .308, or .270), a .22 or .22mag bolt action, 9mm or .45 semi autos, or .38/.357, .44mag revolvers, or anything else that might be interesting. I am open to trade offers that require cash on my end as well, just shoot me your ideas.

This is a great piece of American history and would look great in your living room! Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks!"
