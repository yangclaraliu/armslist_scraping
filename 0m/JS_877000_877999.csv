These are the best alternatives to DS arms or other civilian commercial-manufactured magazines. These were already going for 25 bucks a piece before any of the recent issues, so I am only asking 30 bucks each - or you can take both for $55.

These are METRIC Mags, meaning that they will fit any Metric FAL mag well (most FAL in the world and USA) These arel NOT a proper fit in the British-manufactured ""inch pattern"" L1A1 FAL.

These mags should also work in most =
Rock River or other 'AR' .308 platform guns and other such variants that are set up to run on FAL mags, as well as FN SCAR set up to run FAL mags.. 

Buyer needs to make certain and do their own research to confirm that this is the correct magazine for their application.

When Texas undercover narcotics officers started looking for the perfect concealable pistol, they came to the premier Texas pistol manufacturers. Based on their input, STI has come up with the STI Shadow- a light weight pistol that is as reliable as it is concealable.

The classic slide is 3.0″ in length with rear cocking serrations & standard STI oversized ejection port. The 2 dot tritium night sights have been recessed into the slide and, along with the integral sight channel, provide the perfect compromise between easy sight acquisition and snag free carry. The STI Shadow is built on a forged aluminum STI officer sized frame with a stippled front strap. The grip includes a flat checkered polymer mainspring housing configured to provide excellent retention. The controls are STI’s single sided blued thumb safety and STI’s bobbed high-rise, blued, knuckle relief beavertail grip safety. The barrel is a 3.0″ fully supported STI ramped bull barrel. The STI Shadow comes standard with an STI RecoilMaster guide rod system, STI commander hammer, and patented STI International trigger system.

All external features are KG coated black.   ((( .40 S&W )))

Each box contains two (2) original charger clips (it IS a 'clip' in this case, similar to the Garand in concept) and the original load of five (5) rounds of ammunition in each of the two (2) charger clips, within each box.

Each original box and the head-stamp on all the ammunition has a ""nazi eagle over swastika"" waffenampt, and is marked manufactured in August 1938.. Austria had become part of Nazi Germany five months earlier, in March of 1938.

The maker markings on the 12 ammo clips inside these boxes are mostly Nazi waffenampts with the ""eagle over swastika"",
 but there is at least one ""Federal Republic of Austria Double-Eagle"" in one pack, along with several 'Georg Roth. Vienna, Austria.' ""GR"" marked clips, and there is at least one 'Manfred Weiss Works (Weiss Manfréd Muvek). Csepel (later Budapest), Hungary' ""W in a circle"" marked clip. The entire lot includes a total of 60 rounds of nazi-marked ammunition in their 12 original loading clips and in the original packaging. 

(Please note!- this variety of 8mm ammunition is specifically used in a series of Austrian or Austro-Hungarian rifles and is NOT designed or suitable for the German K98 WW2 military rifle, which uses a slightly different cartridge. 
This ammunition was produced during WW2 after Austria became part of Nazi Germany, and the Nazis continued to use and issue the existing stock of former Austro-Hungarian military rifles as police or second-line weapons)

I will sell each box for $20 each, or you can take the entire lot for $90 cash. 
I am not going to ship ammo since it can only go via UPS (Cannot be sent USPS) and I do not want to deal with the UPS requirements, so you will need to meet FTF to pick up the ammunition.  Buyer must have valid FOID to take possession of any ammo. thanks."

I'm supposed to have a buyer Tuesday but I was really more interested in trading than selling.  It's an ATI 92.  A company in Turkey bought the tooling from Beretta and starting making exact duplicates of the Beretta 92fs.  The ONLY difference is that the barrel isn't chrome lined.  Every part is interchangeable with the Beretta and of course takes the same mags.  It will only include one mag because that's all it came with.  It will come in the box with two cleaning brushes and lube.  It's mint with only 3 mags ran through it.  I have put on Hogue wrap around grips but it will include the original as well.

 TSD Combat Systems TSD-MAG15 M4 Magazines

TESTING OF MAG-15 BY US MIL PERSONNEL
The TSD-MAG15 is a hybrid magazine that combines the best features of polymer and steel magazine designs. Unique to the TSD-MAG15 is the one piece wrap-around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. Unlike many polymer-only feed lips, the hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. The lip on the magazine extends from front to back, from the top of the lips, down to the top of the mag latch area, which allows the magazine to sit on the catch with metal to metal contact, instead of the metal of the mag catch possibly gouging the polymer magazine body and causing feed issues.    
An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches.  The aggressive grip texture between the reinforcing ribs, allows for more positive control on the magazines when manipulating them. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use. 
The internal geometry and  non-tilting follower of the magazine is maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm round. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.  The floor plate is also slimmer than other polymer magazines, maintaining a slimmer outer profile, and making it easier to use in double mag pouches. Disassembly is quite simple, using only a single round of ammo to depress the locking plate, and slide the floor plate to the rear, off the magazine body. 

Moreover, unlike other polymer magazines on the market, the TSD-15 is compatible with multiple modern weapon systems to include the M4/M16/AR-15 systems, the HK416, Sig 556, SCAR-L / Mk16, L85A1, and other similar and STANAG platforms.

      The BUSHNELL HOLOsight uses laser light to illuminate a holographic reticle pattern embedded in the heads-up display window and forms a virtual image of a reticle pattern. The shooter looks through the heads-up display window and sees a bright red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. There is absolutely no light projected onto the target plane, and the sight is legal to use in most shooting and hunting situations. The BUSHNELL HOLOsight has no magnification.

I will take 1150 for the rife the 30 round mag and the drum. Looking to sell locally and not ship. The first person to make a good offer can have it. Must have FOID card and DL. Also not from Cook county or anywhere with restrictions for this setup. Only serious inquiries. Looking to sell fast!

The barrel is made by FN, is cold-hammer forged, and features an M4A1 profile. The barrel is thicker under the handguards to handle the extra heat of rapid fire. This also helps attribute to a unique weight distribution. 

The flash hider is pinned and welded in place in order to make the barrel 16.1"" total length. 

The carbine length gas system was designed to be used on barrels of 14.5"" or shorter. Using a longer barrel will increase wear and tear on other components due to the dwell time. You will not have that issue with this upper.

Comes complete with Magpul MOE handguard, Spike's Tactical bolt carrier group, and charging handle.

Less than 100 rounds fired. 

The EOTech and Magpul back up sights are not included.

The sale does not include the bolt carrier group and charging handle. 

It needs a new detent pin, which can be found at any gunshop for under $5.  They have a tendency to go missing when replacing the stock.  I have it on order, but who knows when it'll ship.  Because of this, the rear takedown pin moves freely.  (The job of the detent spring and pin is to hold it in place).  I can provide links to purchase all of the needed parts.  All are available (for their original retail cost) and in stock if you know where to look.



Feel free to take the missing detent into account when making an offer, but the swap is equivalent to changing your remote's battery in both difficulty and cost.
