It was designed in the 70's to be mounted in ejection seats of military aircraft and used by downed pilots. It is gas piston operated, instead of direct gas impingement, with the buffer spring mounted internal of the op rod housing forward of the receivers.(pretty advanced for it's time, now gas piston AR's are all the rage) It does use some of the same trigger parts,bolt,extractor,firing pin, mag ejector and magazines as AR's. It is a bullpup style, only 25"" overall length, with 11.5 inch barrel w/5.5"" permanently attached flash hider.(legal 16"") It has a unique rotating grip that allows you to lay it on your arm and shoot. I machined an AR quad rail down,and machined mounts for it and the vertical foregrip to modernize it and mount an optic/laser. All mounts are clamp on, so as not to deface the  original ""collector"" value. So you get an ultra-modern firearm and a collector piece all in one for $1200 or best offer"

There is nothing wrong with this gun internally or cosmetically.  Taurus discontinued this gun in the mid 90's and started making the Taurus 24/7 which this gun is very similar to.  I have added a custom rubber grip for added recoil support, and a laser that is hooked to the trigger housing.  The laser is very accurate.  This gun is totally metal, not like the new plastic guns.  This gun is perfect for a range gun, it can be broken down, lubed, and put back together in 30 seconds, and there is also a standard amadextrius safety and decocker.  I do not have to sell it or trade it, I love shooting the gun, but I do need money so if you have a fair offer I will listen, or I am always looking to horse trade for a new toy to play with.

Its kinda rare to find a vehicle this old that has a title.  Powerplant is a 235ci I-6 with a 3 on the tree, the engine runs but the points will need to be adjusted.  I move it in and out of my garage no problem, but I have never had it out on the road.  As with any item that is 58 years old, it has seen its better days.  I was gonna use it for a rat rod so the rust didnt bother me.  I installed 4"" lowering blocks on the rear and was in the process of flat blacking all of it, but with it being cold I havent been able to finish.  All of the trim and lights are off the car, but I do have everything!  

Im really wanting to trade for an AR thats stock, plus some boot.  Ill be willing to entertain trades on rifles and shotguns.  Im a lefty, so if it's a bolt action and is not for a lefty then I can do a trade, sorry.

Description*
The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally trigger system. The Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. The polymer frame design of the Duty and a sleek slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry."

NC residents, make reasonable offer.

NOTICE to buyers: Please provide a phone number and email address along with inquiries/offers, so I may contact you if need be. I tried to reply to an offer from Winston Salem, but your email account blocked my reply.

fs/ft:
Springfield, full-size lightweight model Lew Horton Ltd. edition Night .45. (one of only 300 full-size made by the Springfield Custom Shop for Lew Horton in 1996/7).

Aside from dim night sights (which should be grandfathered in to the lifetime warranty on this model) this gun is in fantastic shape for its age, with only minor holster wear from open carry. 

Videki Speed Trigger, Hogue wraparounds (original to this gun and NOT the newer model), Lightweight hammer, and alloy frame which is a joy to carry compared to std. weight 1911. 

Will include original magazine and an extra, as well as a well-used holster.

Shoots 1.5"" groups (easily more accurate than I am...lol) at 25 yds. I was going to send her off to have Sprigfield replace night sights, but I recently found this EXCACT model in the compact version (4"" vs 5"" barrel). 

I cannot afford to keep both, or I would! 

Make a decent offer in the $750 range, and this beauty is yours. I prefer FTF sales, but will ship from my FFL to any FFL in the CONUS for $750, and I will eat shipping.

NC buyers: CCw or PPP required. NO exceptions! 

Will trade for: Saiga 12, gold, Kimber compact, other rare Springfields but PREFER cash money! :)"

The photo shown is from wiki, but I will provide several high res images if you are interested. 

I say 98%, as there is one small spot on the outside of barrel,  above the chamber with slight pitting from where some idiot (probably me) left a fingerprint. Again, it is minor, and I would not have noticed it unless it was pointed out to me.

I know people say, ""hardly fired"" often, but one look at this rifle and you will agree - it has had little use if any. I suspect less than 20 rounds has been fired.

 This weapon was my Grampa's, and I am no fan of bolt action rifles.

You can see more photos and videos of this suppressor in action here Allison Firearms Media
I am only getting rid of this to upgrade to the Titanium model.

This suppressor will come with an adapter of you choice available from YHM, and may ship separate from the suppressor itself.

Details

YHM, in cooperation with Sound Technologies, is proud to bring you the Stainless Phantom 7.62 Sound Suppression System. The proven performance of YHM's Phantom Flash Hider eliminates 99% of muzzle flash while the Sound Technologies baffle design (U.S. Patent #7,073,426) reduces muzzle noise by up to -32 dB. The fast attach design allows you to permanently install the Phantom Flash Hider and then install the Sound Suppressor without the use of tools when sound suppression is desired. Our Phantom Flash Hider system holds the sound suppressor firmly in place by hand tightening and allows the sound suppressor to be removed by hand when no longer needed. A gas seal keeps the threads clean so the suppressor will not bind, making removal a breeze. The Phantom Flash hider supports the sound suppressor in two places making misalignment nearly impossible, even if the sound suppressor is not fully tightened. 

This sound suppressor is designed so that it can be used with a Phantom 5.56 mm flash hider on a 5.56 mm rifle. This allows users to purchase one sound suppressor and use it on .30 caliber and 5.56 mm rifles. As a measure of safety the 5.56 sound suppressor WILL NOT fit onto a 7.62 flash hider.

Warranty:
YHM offers a lifetime warranty against defects in material and workmanship and will repair or replace, free of charge, any sound suppressor manufactured by YHM. The Phantom Flash Hider must be installed by a licensed gunsmith or the warranty will be considered null and void. Use of an aftermarket mounting system will result in the warranty being considered null and void. This warranty does not cover damage to the sound suppressor and/or host firearm resulting in whole or in part from criminal or negligent use, improper or careless handling, modifications, defective, improper hand-loaded, or reloaded ammunition, or neglect. This warranty does not cover damage to the sound suppressor or host firearm due to improper installation of the Flash Hider, the Sound Suppressor, or an improperly threaded barrel. The minimum barrel length for which the suppressor is warranted is 10.5 inches. Any repairs not covered by this warranty will be charged to the owner."

Fired very few times since new, and always cleaned and oiled after firing. Comes with original box and paperwork and two 18rnd magazines.

Striker-fired and operates much like a Glock, but with a more ergonomic shape and trapezoid sights.

Personally, I liked the old M9 better than the Glock but I know they had some complaints. However, this is a more freshly imported 2010 model, which has an improved trigger and ejector. Best trigger I've ever felt on a striker pistol; once the lightly-sprung trigger safety is depressed, the break comes instantly with a firm pull. Reset is quick and easy to feel.

Also of note is that even though this is the full-size 'M' pistol from Steyr, it's sized more like a G19 and conceals very well for an 18rnd pistol.
