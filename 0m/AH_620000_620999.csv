This is gorgeous, from the Walnut stock to checkering on the stock and forearm. This also has the unique feature where the shell is loaded and ejected from the bottom. So no more flying empty hulls hitting your buddy. Everything works great. I don’t see any dings, marks or flaws. I would put the overall condition at 95% and that only because it’s “used”. Comes with the original box, case, owner’s manual and DVD, two pro-bore choke tubes, three extra shims to adjust the LOP and bore tool.

One problem:
-Front post night sight does not glow. 

That's about all that's wrong with it. Here's what's right with it...

-Inside the guide rod was replaced with a stainless steel one. The factory ships them with a wimpy plastic model and this is a nice upgrade. 

-There's an extended mag release installed. Nice for quick magazine changes. 

-Also installed is the 3.5 lb trigger kit. 

I'll include the original box, with the cleaning supplies as well as the original sights.

The M57 is in overall good shape, but it has been fired with corrosive ammo, so the bore isn't as pristine as it could be. Rifling is still strong, though.

Spare slide is because the original developed a crack at a corner of the ejection port. Picked up a complete replacement slide and have had no issues. Original slide, while cracked, has the firing pin, spring, and stop still intact for use as spares.

Ammo is polish surplus, I believe. Was originally a can of 1280, and have only fired a few magazines of it, so there is at least 1200 rounds left. Will be in a .50 cal ammo can, separated into baggies of 50 rounds each.

I would prefer not to split these up, and will not sell the M57 if the ammo is unsold. Will not ship, and will not drive more than 20 miles to meet buyer. I will need a copy of your drivers license or FFL, I have a C&R and need this for my records. If you're offering a trade, tell me what you expect your trade item to be worth.

From Wiki:

The Improved Outer Tactical Vest, or IOTV, is an enhanced version of, and a replacement for, the older Outer Tactical Vest variant of the Interceptor body armor , as fielded by the United States Army. The IOTV is compatible with the Deltoid and Axillary Protector System (DAPS) components, ESAPI (Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert), Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBI), as well as the OTV's groin protector.

The OTV design was considered insufficient and lacking in certain areas, which led to the IOTV's development and fielding. The IOTV is produced by Point Blank Body Armor, BAE Systems, KDH Defense Systems, Protective Products Enterprise and UNICOR. [1] [2] [3] The IOTV first saw action in combat with U.S. Army ground combat units in late 2007/early 2008, and currently remains the standard body armor type used by regular U.S. Army ground combat units overseas.

A size Medium IOTV weighs 3.6 pounds less than a Medium OTV vest, while providing more coverage. However, a fully equipped IOTV, complete with all its components (soft armor panel inserts, four ballistic plate inserts (front and back plates and two side plates), collar, and groin protectors) still weighs 30 pounds (13.6 kg), with a Large IOTV weighing about 35 pounds (15.9 kg). The functionality of the enhanced side ballistic inserts, which provide coverage under the arms and down the sides of the torso, is built-in to the IOTV. [4]

The IOTV provides the ability to don the vest in two ways. The first is to simply place the vest over the head and pull down, and the second is to remove fasteners on the wearer's left shoulder, sliding into the vest to the right. To complete the procedure for both methods the wearer then lifts up the front panel of the vest and fastens the waistband, which takes the weight of the vest off the shoulders somewhat, and then fastens the side protection modules. [4]

A key design feature for the IOTV is that the entire armor system is able to be released with the pull of a hidden lanyard. The armor then falls apart into its component pieces, providing a means for escape in case the wearer falls into water or becomes trapped in a hazardous environment. [5] The hidden release lanyard also allows medical personnel easier access to the casualty, which was one concern that was not addressed with the old Interceptor armor.

It also features a grid of PALS webbing on the front, back, and sides for the attachment of modular pouches and accessories.

The US Army is looking into supplementing the heavy IOTV with the newer Modular Body Armor Vest (MBAV) and Soldier Plate Carrier System (SPCS) already in service in Ranger and Airborne units. The MBAV and SPCS do provide less armor coverage, but are lighter than the IOTV, thus more suitable for patrol in Afghanistan . The first units began receiving body armor on May 11, 2009

The IOTV is designed to take the weight of the vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. The vest is also equipped with a mesh inner cover that is designed to improve airflow inside of the armor. There is also a back pad in the lower back area of the vest, which is designed to defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. However, the back pad does not provide ballistic protection. The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear plates (SAPI NIJ standard III), however, the new E-SAPI plates will increase protection to armor-piercing rounds (NIJ standard IV). The IOTV provides, without the ballistic ceramic plates inserted, protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. 9mm) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified. This is a huge improvement over the PASGT vest, and the Vietnam era fragmentation vest (which was made of nylon). Both only offered protection against fragmentation.

with sun-shade
Our 10x42 side focus tactical scope is the absolute benchmark standard in fixed power scopes, no question about it. It is the twin sister of the 16x42 model. Tactical knobs with protective caps and rezero capability, 1 piece steel body, wide angle ocular, 4 inch eye relief, 100 MOA windage & elevation adjustment, rock solid reliability. Offered with a 4-inch sunshade and MP-8 reticule.  Fixed 10x tactical scopes have been longstanding favorites amongst precision marksmen who value their rugged simplicity and all-around solid performance. But not all fixed 10s are created equal. IOR's 10x42 sporting scope, for example, eclipses the competition where it counts: durability, brightness, image clarity, rangefinding capability, adjustment range, etc. We offer it with our two best reticles for sporting shooting: our proprietary MP-8 and our modified Mil Dot.

This gun was purchased new by my grandfather and handed down to me over 24 years ago. He used it as a saddle rifle in his youth and deer hunting in his later years. I have only put 10 rounds through it since I got it. I've never been hunting and don't ever plan on it so I would rather sell it to someone who can get some use out of it rather than it sitting in a closet for another 20 years with me.
It's in beautiful condition and books around $800-$1000 due to the rare sleek (non-checkered) stock and no factory sling rings attached. All original bluing and wood stain. Not drilled and tapped for scope. Reproduction hang tag, instructions, and guarantee paperwork that originally came with the rifle also included.
I would like to get $700 but open to any reasonable offer.
We can do an FFL transfer if you want to, but since the rifle is over 75 years old it qualifies as a collector&relic so in state it's not really necessary. I will ship out of state only to a FFL."

This rifle is the Carbine model in 7.62 x 39. The Rasheed A.K.A. the Rashid was made in the 60's by the U.A.R. (United Arab Republic) for the Egyptians. It was and is basically comparable to the SKS with a few minor and major differences in design. There were only about 8,000 made before the military smartly switched over to the AK47. 

I have yet to shoot this gem, but she appears well made and I really hope to find a magazine soon.

Thank you for looking as it is my hope that someone in our community may have a mag for sale or know someone who has one they'll let go of for a fair price.



Happy safe shooting and don't forget to vote!
Cheers!"
