After building the gun, I have shot about 10 rounds to sight it in.

This is a good gun, has fired well the few times I actually did fire it, would make a great conceal carry gun, I'm just looking to upgrade to something with a slightly longer barrel, and a larger frame. Comes with 2 magazines and a small amount of ammo

I would consider a trade (and possibly throwing in some cash) for a 9mm or .40 must fit what I stated I was looking for to be considered.

""The Isis-1 was great, the Isis-2 (new for 2012) is even better!  Now rated for SUBSONIC .300 Blackout as well as centerfire pistol and rimfire calibers, the Isis-2 is truly among the quietest and most versatile 9mm pistol suppressors on the market.  Improvements to the old design include a threadless tube (both stronger and easier to disassemble), and improved suppression (that’s right, it’s even quieter!)  Until now, sacrifices had to be made when picking out a 9mm suppressor.  While the industry standard suppressors that accept multiple mounts are excellent performers, they cannot be effectively cleaned or used with dirty rimfire ammunition due to the fact that they are sealed units.  Our Isis-2 accepts industry standard recoil booster, tri-lug, uzi, and fixed thread mounts and disassembles easily for cleaning and user-service with our included billet disassembly tool.  That translates into you buying one suppressor and using it on everything from 9mm on down to .22lr.  Possibly, best of all, we didn’t raise the price. As with all of our suppressors, we have utilized state-of-the-art mono-core technology to provide you with excellent suppression, minimum number of parts to juggle, (the entire suppressor disassembles into only three parts), minimum poi shift, and unmatched ease of cleaning and user maintenance.  Spend less, shoot more guns suppressed…Isis-2."" -thompsonmachine.net

This is an older one that has seen lots of rounds. Priced accordingly. I believe the barrel may be newer than the gun but I am not sure as I inherited it. She still works great and mechanics are good. Don't come over expecting something flawless. I estimate 20,000 rounds but that is a blind guess.

The ""safe action"" system consists of three (3) automatic independently operating mechanical safeties which are sequentially disengaged when pulling the trigger and which are automatically re-engaged when releasing the trigger. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds as standard and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain the worldwide distribution among security personnel and secret services.

.357 mag   6 ROUNDS-CYLINDER

BLACK FINISH  

The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom-most chamber, which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm, allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. 

This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat-sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. The Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

Overview:
The Model 1100 Sporting 12 provides timeless good looks in a light-recoiling sporting clays gun. It features a polished blue receiver and 28-inch light target contoured vent rib barrel with twin bead target sights. The American walnut stock and fore-end display cut checkering with a high-gloss finish and a sporting clays style recoil pad. The Model 1100 Sporting 12 also offers a gold-plated trigger, as well as four extended choke tubes: Skeet, Improved Cylinder, Light Modified and Modified. 
There are those shooters for whom the 20-gauge is the ideal recipe of propellant, payload, and power. Many skeet shooters even use the 20-gauge in 12-gauge events because of its reduced recoil. And as a Sporting Clays gun, it represents a great combination of pattern density and pellet energy to grind up targets in even the most difficult presentations. Our Model 1100 Sporting has American walnut stock with gloss finish and includes a sporting-style recoil pad. The 28-inch vent rib barrel comes with four interchangeable Rem™ Choke tubes in Skeet, Improved Cylinder, Light Modified, and Modified.

Just need money so hey, I can always build and customize another someday right?

It's a Remington 597 autoloading .22LR rimfire rifle.  Standard sporter stock and factory barrel etc. BUT- I made the two most important upgrades, which REALLY COMPLETELY change everything- The Volquartsen Exact Edge Extractor and Target Hammer.  This makes the rifle unbelievably reliable and accurate and enjoyable to shoot.

The Extractor is the known flaw in the 597.  Volquartsen happens to be the biggest and best (and most expensive) name in rimfire.  They should just contract with Remington to do this stuff from the factory, but they haven't yet.  The Exact Edge Extractor makes the operation and extraction of this rifle *PERFECT*.  Since installation EVERY SINGLE SHOT has been perfect.  

The Target Hammer does a few things, namely reduces the 'trigger pull' by 50% and eliminates any play or 'creep' in the trigger.   I read so many times the cliche that a rifle has a trigger that 'breaks like glass' and i laughed at that stupid saying, then I experienced in on my customized 597.

I also had the gunsmith baby the rifle and give it some tender loving care which he did so it's been completely inspected, babyed, accurized etc.  He then installed oversized premium Sling Swivels to go with the Sling Studs he installed and added a standard military contractor 'silent sling'.  

I also added a Winchester bipod 9-13"" that is an exact Harris copy.  

I also replaced the factory scope with a brand new Nikon ProStaff 4-12x40mm Nikoplex reticle scope, which is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

Lastly I had some fun and custom spray paint 'camo' colored the stock.  I know its quite unique.  If you don't like it you can of course just spray over it a color of your choice or however you want to change it , camo-dip it, etc.  Extremely nice aftermarket stocks are about $92 I just wanted to custom spray paint mine rather than buy a replacement for coloring.

I put a TON OF MONEY into this with the upgraded parts, new scope, bipod, sling stud, swivels, sling, gunsmithing, etc.  I am just asking for a decent overall portion back, which is not everything I put into this.  It's probably been fired less than a box of bulk ammo and is just beginning to show its break in potential.  

Thanks much, serious people contact me, we will work a deal out.  of COURSE all laws apply, FFID/DL matching a must."

414,http://www.armslist.com/posts/567414,For Sale:  Leatherwood Hi-Lux CMR 1-4x 24,"Parker, Denver, Colorado",$ 438,"Listed On: Monday, September 17, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"When a shooting situation gets up close and personal, you need a scope that was designed and built specifically for that kind of shooting - whether during a tactical situation or when hunting dangerous big game. To compromise with anything else could prove to be life threatening. The 1-4x CMR (Close Medium Range) scope is the scope you need. This relatively short 30mm tube scope does not add a lot of weight to any rifle, and thanks to the large diameter of the scope tube, it lets in a lot of light for a bright target image. Also, due to the high quality fully multi-coated lenses, that image is also clear and sharp. An extremely practical circular reticle aids in quick target acquisition by drawing the attention of the shooter's eye to the center of the scope. To insure that the target is fully visible, this reticle has only a horizontal crosshair, with a partial vertical lower crosshair. The upper half of this reticle leaves the scope clean and uncluttered. Plus, the lower crosshair features short bar aiming points calibrated for standard .223 and .308 service ammo, which are very precise out to 600 meters. Another great feature of the 1-4x CMR scope is Leatherwood's new ""Zero Locking System"", which does exactly what it says. Once the shooter has the scope sighted in, this system allows that alignment to be locked in place, still offering a minimal amount of adjustment for slight tweaking of shot placement. This is the most advanced ""zero guarantee"" in the industry today. The 1-4x CMR scope is built with all of the ruggedness and reliability that has made this line well known for its quality and value. Other features include tough, wear resistant Perma-Coat soft luster blue-black finish, lenses polished to photographic quality, ""Tri-Center"" spring tension for positive windage and elevation adjustment, and a Fast Focus large diameter ocular lens. The Leatherwood CMR Rifle Scope is covered by a limited lifetime factory warranty.

A revolutionary rifle design—the HK SL8-6 is constructed almost entirely of a reinforced carbon-fiber polymer. Based on the combat-proven G36 rifle used by the German Army, the SL8-6 uses a proven short stroke, piston-actuated gas operating system, well known for simplicity and reliability.

Designed and engineered to deliver exceptional shooting performance, the SL8 is a favorite among European target shooters, due in large part to its modular construction and free-floating bull barrel. A short Picatinny rail mount is standard and allows accessory optics to be easily added. Made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process, the SL8-6 barrel ensures accuracy and long life. The ergonomic and clean lines of the H&K SL8-6 are functional and modern, giving the SL8-6 the look and feel of a 21st century firearm.

Rifle is in excellent condition with about 400 rounds through it. I have removed the grenade sight and bayonet lug, as well as cut the front sight hood to more resemble an M14 style front sight. All areas that were cut have been re-blued. The upper handguard has been replaced with a ventilated steel one.

I have changed the original stock to a polymer one with a cheek rest, and the original rear sight has been removed and a fully adjustable aperture rear sight has been installed. I have also added a harris-style bipod that folds forward and is adjustable for height and cant. The magazine pictured holds 10 rounds and is detachable.

The rifle is a great shooter and my modifications to it were inspired by the styling of the M14. It was a fun project but these days all of my 7.62x39 goes through my AK.

Sale must be FTF
Buyer will receive the rifle as pictured, with some stripper clips (I think around 15) the original rear sight and magazine. If I have any other stuff related to the rifle I will throw that in too, but the things listed are what I can guarantee. No ammo is included.

Other info: I've had this as a ""night stand gun"" for years. It has a bobbed hammer, brushed stainless finish, and aside from some wear marks from carry, is in perfect mechanical shape. Word of warning is that the DA trigger on these Rossi's are pretty heavy. It's a solid shooter and accurate enough for a 2"" barrel. I have fit on some Pachmayr grips. Cylinder gap is 0.009"", there is some play and end shake, even in lock up, but I haven't handled a Rossi that didn't have that - when shooting I get no lead spatter or significant strap cutting, and it's perfectly in time. Internals are enlarged S&W parts more or less, so if you know how a Smith works, this is much the same. I'll include a soft pistol case as well."

This Tactical / Hunting Rifle takes down (without tools) and fits into a backpack or Hard Case (both included) in less than 20 seconds! It goes back together in the same amount of time.

It is fiercely accurate - Sub 3/8"" groups at 100 yds all day long with 200 gr Sierra's or 210 gr Bergers. I've shot several groups at less than 1.50"" at 500 yds! (and I've got the targets to prove it). The only time that I tried, I hit the 12"" x 12"" steel gong at 954 yds at the Washoe Range, 17 times, out of 17 tries.

It takes H.S. quite a while to make one of these. I special ordered this rifle in 2003, and finally received it in 2006.


Some of the features included are:

Hard Pelican Case - (Briefcase) measures approx. 24""W x 19""L x 9""H that fits the entire dis-assembled rifle, scope, bolt, magazines, etc in cutouts.

Tactical soft Backpack (by Assault Systems) that fits the entire dis-assembled rifle. I've never used this case, but it came with the rifle and it's got some dust on it from sitting in the closet.

Threaded Muzzle - with Muzzle Break, and Muzzle Cap - use which ever one you want to.
1:10 twist 26"" Fluted Barrel 
Detachable Magazines (very quite) - qty 4 included
Tally Mounts and 30mm quick detach Tally Rings
Swarovski 6-24x50 P L Dot scope with original box and sun shade
H/S Precision Granite Colored synthetic stock
It has always been stored in a safe.

... 

This rifle has 300 +/- rnds thru it. Cleaned meticulously and regularly. It shoots everything well. It is the most well balanced rifle I've ever owned. I have carried it on several hunting trips, and so it shows some use, but not much.

Last time I checked, lead-time for one of these PTD's was 1+ yrs. The scope alone sells for over 3k now, and the rifle (with all of the options that this one has) sells new for over 6k (9k+ price tag to replace).

I am the original owner. I'm moving, and won't need it.

Cash only pls - I'm not interested in checks/trades/etc.

From  Thompson Center:


Since the introduction of the Renegade rifle in 1974, its reputation as a no-frills, ultra-dependable cap lock rifle has steadily grown. Devoid of the brass trim associated with our Hawken, the Renegade maintains the top of the line quality that all T/C Muzzleloaders are known for and continues to be one of the most popular traditional cap lock rifles used during the special seasons each year. This ""no nonsense"" rifle has accounted for all types of North American game and exotic species - and it continues to bring in the trophies. The Renegade Hunter sports a single trigger with a wide bow trigger guard allowing the use of gloves in cold weather. It is being re-introduced for those hunters who desire to participate in a more “primitive” style of hunting.
Caliber: .50 Caliber

Barrel: Length 26"", Octagon, polished & blued. 1"" across the flats. 1 in 48"" rifling twist. QLA® Muzzle System. Drilled and tapped for scope mounts (using rear sight holes and breech plug hole).

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
