The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Make me an offer. Up for auction is my Arminius H. Weihrauch revolver collection, which includes one blued HW7 .22 with a 6 inch barrel, has some rust pitting, but in good over all condition. next is a bled HW3 .22 2 3/4 barrel, the finish on this one is a little flat with some holster wear. Next is a blued HW5 .22 4 in barrel, little wear on the finish but in over all pretty good shape. Next is a nickle plated HW7T .22 6 inch vent/ribbed barrel with a beautiful finish, other than some light scratches. I do have the .22 magnum cylinder which will work in all of the .22 revolvers (Make sure it is safe with your local gunsmith) I have tried it in 2 of the .22's and it worked great. Next is a nickle plated HW5T .32 S&W L/S 4 inch vent/ribbed barrel with 7 shot capacity, finish is beautiful other than some light scratches, both nickle guns have very low round count. Next is a Arminius blued model 17 in the 380 KAL, this is the hammerless gun in the pictures, the finish is worn but still looks to be in good condition. Next is a HW38 with worn finish over the whole gun with rust pitting, and missing front sights. Next is a blued HW3 32 S&W S/L 2 3/4 inch barrel with some holster wear, but other than that in pretty good shape. Next is a blued HW3 32 S&W S/L with a 4 inch barrel, finish is a little flat with some rust, but in pretty good over all shape. Next is a Titan Tiger 38 special with 2 inch barrel, the finish is taken off the frame and polished and has some rust pitting on cylinder and wear on the barrel. Next is another HW38 parts gun (Gun is in peaces) I do believe I have everything to complete this gun, as well as extra grips and a 2 1/2 inch barrel and front sight. Next is a blued HW357 with a 6 inch vent/ribbed barrel, finish is pretty nice except for some wear on the barrel, very low round count. Next is another HW357 blued with a 4 inch vent/ribbed barrel, finish is pretty nice with some wear and minor rust pitting on cylinder, I think this would clean up to be a really nice gun. 13 guns in all, some pretty rare to come by, I will set a pretty low reserve for this collection (Just what I have into them) All guns do lock up nice and shoot great. The only gun I have not fired is the 17, I am not really sure if that is the model number, it says 17 right under the barrel on the ejector. All guns should be checked out by a qualified gunsmith before being fired. I do have the original box for one of the .22's as well as 1 or 2 holsters. I am not a gunsmith and will not be held liable for anything that goes wrong with them. There are no returns so please ask all questions before bidding. All sales are as is and final and have to be shipped to an FFL. I will have to get a zip code to get a estimate on shipping, and if your FFL will not take guns from a private owner there will be a charge from FFL to FFL. I will except US money orders, personal check and PayPal, guns will be shipped as soon as funds are received. Please feel free to ask any questions and I can also send more pictures if needed. Thanks for looking and have a wonderful day."

 According to Whittington's records it was included in a delivery of 65,000 Beretta M1934/35 pistols delivered to the German Army Headquarters in Italy between Aug 1944 and Feb, 1945. Those serial # were 534000/599000.- ""mine has #'s in that range""
 After the 8 September 1943 armistice between Italy and the Allies, the Germans saddled Beretta with three engineers from Germany. Moreover the factory was GARRISONED BY THE SS! Weapons of that time, even the ones produced for the Germans, bore the punch mark 4UT, (Quarto Ufficio tecnico di Controllo Armi e Munizioni--4th Technnical Control Unit...
-an C. Still, in Axis Pistols, page 107, states,
""It is likely that almost all of the 4/UT, ...were used by the German Army"". He also includes two other variations in this statement, ""1944 dated and blank slide Model 1935"".
Ugo Menchini, in Pietro Beretta Le Automatiche, regarding an M1934, page 255, states,
""In late 1940 there appears an oval including the punch mark IVU. It refers to the 4th technical Control Unit of the FAG, where inspection was carried out.""
 Note that, while they seem to represent the same inspectors, the ""IVU"" is not the same mark as the ""4UT"". The IVU would be found on the pre RSI model M1934, and the 4UT would be found on the RSI model M1935.
 These are the reasons why I believe that it is likely that all of the 4UT Berettas WERE RSI pistols!! the IVU and the 4UT were the same office, but under Italian management -the IVU, before the surrender of Italy, and German the 4UT, so after september, 8 1943.

This is a limited edition run of 400 that produced by Colt at some point early in the 10mm production days. I believe these were made in the 1988-89 timeframe. This gun is number 391 of 400. As best as I've been able to determine by contacting other owners and reading on forums this gun was an early custom and accurized version of the Delta Elite. It came with Gold Cup frame, adjustable Millet sights, adjustable trigger, and adjustable hammer. I purchased the gun from the original owner several years ago. He said he had racked the slide a few times on one occasion, but other than that it has sat in his safe unfired. Since I purchased it I have only taken it out once a year to give it a nice wipe down before putting it back in the plastic. The gun is absolutely pristine. The box and paperwork are as you see in the pictures. I have not removed the red packaging tape to determine exactly what is underneath the manual. I've never been able to bring myself to shoot this one. I also own one other Match 10 that I've had customized by Colt. That one I will never part with.

Price reduced to $1400 local or $1450 shipped.  I would prefer a local sale if possible, but I am willing to ship.

I am not interested in trades. I've already made my purchase and now I need to sell this to pay for it. I really hate to part with it, but unfortunately I'm not made of money so if I want something else usually something has to go. This time this one loses. Will only ship to FFL and they must be willing to accept transfer from non FFL."

This is a collectors rifle. No re-arsenal markings or signs of refurbishment anywhere on this rifle. It has all matching numbers on the bolt, carrier, stock, receiver, receiver cover, magazine, trigger guard, rear sight, and gas tube. It has the original blade bayonet, original cleaning rod, original cleaning kit, 10 stripper clips, and soft case. The bore is bright and shiny with strong rifling. The bluing is original and none of the pats have been painted over later. The stock is its original dark hardwood finish and has the original serial number without being forced matched and having a bunch of XXXXX's over the old serial number. The stock has no cracks or deep gouges, just minor handling wear. The receiver cover is marked with the Tula star inside the star logo and has the date stamp of 1952r under the logo. I bought this gun over a year and a half ago and it has sat in the safe ever since. I have never fired it, and never planned to in order to keep it in the collectors condition it is currently in. I know what this gun is worth as would any serious SKS collector so please don't try to low ball me and compare this with the Yugo's and Norinco's out there. Take a look at gunbroker for similar condition rifles and you will see that there are few out there and are worth every bit of my asking price.

Built around the proven M-1500 action, 24 inch hammer forged bull barrel with recessed muzzle crown,  matte stainless steel. The M-1500's acclaimed trigger adjusts for sear engagement and weight of pull. A three position safety allows safe single loading and secure bolt lock down. Recoil pads and swivel studs are standard. This Varminter Supreme stock is designed with a raised comb and rollover cheekpiece, a full pistol grip with palm filling swell, a broad beavertail forend and vented stock for barrel cooling. 
I purchased two of these new in 2009 and fired 20 Hornady rounds though this one it to compare the two… It has been stored in gun sock in my safe since…removed only to clean.  I just sold the other one which had a Zeiss scope…these both are  absolute sub-MOA (for me…in fact both shot as well as my Custom Cooper).

I am on here to list my buggy project. What I have is a buggy called the Piranha, the design comes from Australia. This was professionally welded and has brand new tires. It originally came with a susuki 500cc engine that will still go with the package. The cream of the crop though is the 01 Yamaha R1 Engine. There is ample room for the engine to fit either way. When finished this buggy will be capable of a 0-60 in under 5 seconds. It will be a buggy of extreme proportions! Muahahaha

Why I have it on arms list is because I am willing to make a trade for a lot of firearms. If anyone has a lot they are wanting to trade or sell and are interested in a buggy, please get in touch with me!

Ok got this boat a couple weeks ago to fix up and take her out, I am not allowed to store it any longer so its got to.go. ill tell you all the good and bad. its 17'10"" , good trailor, New tires, has a force 120 outboard also a 1990, that is in mint condition. All parts kook brand new, has power trim. Boat has livewell,storage areas, 5 seats, front and back casting deck, bow mount trolling motor which needs hooked up, lights need hooked up, all dash gauges work, has anchors, brand new marine grade cd player with speakers installed, cb radio, fish finder. bad parts, the guy wet sanded half the boat so it looks like a dusty white but if you buff it she goes right back to sparkly red. The guy put new floors in, he screwed 3 small screws thru the bottom of the fiberglass. There tight so I was gonna grind them off and put resin over them. quick and easy. Ummm I think that's it. The.motor it self is worth $2000 or more. I will sell for $1100.00 plus a glock or ar or nice compound bow or? Looking to get cash also. This would make a great boat. I just can't keep it in the garage any longer. will send pics .."

-This was built from an older Remington Police 308 with the old style Remington trigger.  Trigger is set at 3 lbs and is very crisp with absolutely no creep.
-Factory black parkerized finished action with parkerized bottom metal.
-Bell and Carlson stock with aluminum bedding block.  The barrel channel has been opened up for the larger barrel and the barrel nut.  The action is not bedded.  It never needed it to shoot when it was a 308, so I never did it.
-Brand new PTG firing pin assembly.  The original was a J lock so I replaced it.
-Center Shot carbon fiber F-class bipod with USA team colors.  Like new condition.  This bipod is made from carbon fiber and is super light.  It has vertical adjustments like a benchrest.  It has skids on the feet and was built for the USA F-class team.  When I bought it they were like $450 new, now they are $300 for the plain unfinished versions…  So, that sucks for me!!!
-Brand new 28” Kreiger/Criterion 1-8 twist heavy varmint barrel (40 rounds fired-just broken in).  This gun is already shooting under ½” groups no problem using the Sierra 107’s and R15 loads I use in my bench gun (no load development at all), and I am not used to shooting with a hunting trigger any more so I would think it can shoot pretty darn tight with a tactical shooter on the trigger.
-The rifle feeds wonderfully.  I had no issues with it.  I am not sure why there is so much discussion about modifying the 308 style box for the 6BR…  It works fine for me.

I am selling this because I pretty much just shoot off the benchrest anymore, and I am going to build another benchrest rifle.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with this dude.  He’s a shooter…

Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Fire Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to bump fire more safely, offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! You can now safely and accurately bump-fire your AR-15 at an incredible rate. Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, and Installation / Operation Instructions. Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship.

 Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the firearm. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.
