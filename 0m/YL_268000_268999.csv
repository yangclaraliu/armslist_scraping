If you've got something not on my list, fire away.  My interest is pretty easily piqued.  All I ask of anyone proposing an offer:  first, know what you have.  No, I will not trade straight across for your rack-grade M1 or your ""unique"" or ""customized"" SKS.  Second, don't beat around the bush.  If you've got what you believe is an $800 trade, then offer your trade + $100.  Do not offer trade + ""some cash"".  You know what you're willing to pay/take, so don't make me guess.  Thanks!

Last but not least, all the standard junk.  IL transactions will be recorded on a bill of sale and FOID info will be recorded.  Shipping only to FFL.

From Wikipedia:The Rifle 7.62mm 2A/2A1 (also known as the Ishapore 2A/2A1) is a 7.62mm NATO (7.62x51) calibre bolt-action rifle adopted as a reserve arm by the Indian military in 1963.

The design of the rifle - initially the Rifle 7.62mm 2A - began at the Ishapore Rifle Factory in India, soon after the Sino-Indian War of 1962.

The Ishapore 2A/2A1 has the distinction of being the last bolt-action rifle designed to be used by a regular military force other than specialized sniper rifles. Due to fluctuating supplies of affordable .303 British ammunition, the Ishapore rifles are becoming increasingly popular with civilian shooters and collectors in Australia, United Kingdom and the United States."

The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider.

This shotgun is built on the famous AK-47 action that has been proven by years of very reliable combat action!
The shotgun is used to deliver single shots. It is reloaded automatically due to the energy of powder combustion gases bled from the barrel bore through the barrel port. The shotgun may be equipped with a sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation, which makes zeroing and firing at moving targets more convenient. The gas motive unit is adjustable to match the parameters of internal ballistics inherent to the standard cartridges and ""Magnum"" cartridges, as well. For the purpose of diversifying operational capabilities the shotgun may be equipped with muzzle adapters of different chokes, including the muzzle adapter ""Paradox"". (IZHMASH)

I can add cash for the right 1911... But be real, ex. a basic Springfield 1911 with $180 worth of Wilson combat parts is not worth $1100."

It's the target model with fully adjustable rear sight.

Comes with everything pictured, which includes: slide/barrel assembly, 2 10-round mags, take down tool, manual/instructions, and the case.

I had no issues with this slide while it was on my 1911, but I did have to enlarge the area where the safety catches the slide slightly. For whatever reason, the slide was too small for my Sig's safety to operate properly. It's not ""hogged out"", it's almost impossible to tell it's been modified.

I can't say what guns this will/won't fit. All I can say is that it fit both of my Sig 1911's. 

I had the best luck with CCI Mini-Mag and CCI Stinger. Prior to break in I had average luck with Federal Auto Match and marginal luck with Wolf Match...I never retested after break in; so they may work well now - but I couldn't guarantee that. Your hammer spring weight will also have an impact on what ammo you can/can't shoot.

A reason was that the three national armories, Manufacture Nationale d'Armes de Châtellerault (MAC), Saint Etienne (MAS) and Tulle (MAT) were forced to prioritize the manufacture of rifles and machine guns for the war effort and as Northern France, the most industrialized region, was under German Occupation, the French then looked to its southern neighbor Spain for its solution. Spain which had its arms making industry setup in the northeastern Basque region was a natural source of supply for handguns as they manufactured them in calibers that were common to the various military in Europe. The French authorities decided to purchase from Spain a semi-automatic pistol called the ""Ruby"" or otherwise known as to the French as the Pistolet Automatique de 7 millimètre 65 genre ""Ruby"".

This gun has all the approval marks by the French government. Very nice and tight. I've seen many new guns that are not as tight as this one. It is a GREAT shooter.

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gun sight (ACOG) designed for the M16M4 weapon system (14.5 barrel). It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator."

This is a nice, original finish Colt, US Army issue 1911 45 ACP. I believe everything is matching, it is a good solid gun, shoots very well. According to the serial number the production date was 1918. Most of these were overhauled in 1920 & parkerized at that time. This one wasn't. There is only one possible flaw. There is some discoloration on the frame just forward of the trigger guard on the left side. Some have speculated this was possibly do to removal of the US Property stamp. It is VERY hard to tell! Ser. No. 293XXX. C&R license is OK."

Im still offering the Smith and Wesson 686-1 that most have you have seen for the past few weeks. It is a six shot stainless steel revolver and it was produced before the controversial integral trigger lock was implemented that tends to make today's revolvers unreliable. It was purchased in the late 80's and the timing and trigger pull is still top of the line. It fires 357 magnum loads as well as 38 special.

Next is my prized Springfield XDM 3.8 compact 9mm. I've only taken it to the range a couple times but it has performed beyond what i've come to expect a polymer pistol can do. Im not too keen on getting rid of this, but I thought I would add it to the list in case the right pistol came along.

Last is a Taurus model 608 in stainless steel, 357 Magnum/38 special with a 8 3/8 inch barrel. This is a massive revolver with an 8 round cylinder and an incredible sight radius. This would make a suberb hunting weapon. 

I am almost exclusively looking at straight across trades but, that being said, if you want to offer cash for any of the weapons, your e-mail will not be ignored. I would be willing to trade multiple weapons for high quality offers. Sorry about the lack of quality pictures, I could only upload 3 but I can provide additional ones at your request.

I would be happy to answer any questions and I will respond as quick as possible to all who are interested. Thanks for looking!"
