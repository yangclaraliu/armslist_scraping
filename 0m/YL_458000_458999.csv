According to the serial number, this pistol was made in 1911.  It is in very good shape.  Unfortunately, somewhere in time, one of the original grips was replaced.  But the other grip is original Colt.

Also, the magazine is hard to remove.  I'm not sure why.  When the magazine is removed, the mag release lever works and does not stick.  So I'm pretty sure that the issue is with the magazine.

298,http://www.armslist.com/posts/458298,For Sale:  Wanna play Paintball? Want a one of a kind rifle? Come and take a look!,"Rogersville, Springfield, Missouri",$ 400,"Listed On: Sunday, August 19, 2012",Paintball/Airsoft,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Whether your a new player, or an old wardog like myself, nothing makes the game more fun than a little more realism. Ever wanted to play sniper with your buddies in the woods? You know you have. 

Heres your chance to have a very cool, custom paintball rifle. This started out life as an Air Guns Design Automag paintball gun, a design and company known for reliability and consistency since the earliest days of the sport. It was then modified into a rifle, with a reworked but extremely simple trigger mechanism and a horizontal feed tube running to the right side of the barrel that holds 15 rounds, and feeds them via a spring that pushes the next into the chamber, originally this was 20 rounds but at some point it was cut down in order to make the barrel change easier. 20 dollars on Ebay can get you another body to use a hopper.

I must stess that its seen a pretty extensive amount of play and the paint could use a refinish, or if your like me, like the well worn look, leave it as is.

The specs:
This automag rifle sports a  14-16 inch barrel made by Palmers Pursuit Shop, one of the most renown and hard working air smith companies in the sport, with a long heritage of quality behind everything they make. It is Stainless Steel and built like a tank. Also included is an automag to AUTOCOCKER barrel adaptor, should the barrel not prove to be good enough, simply pop in the adaptor and utilize the MOST used barrel threading in the sport.
What I believe is a Nikon scope, Im not good with scopes when I cannot see the name, but its clear as day and very good. Whatever it is, its overkill for paintball, but the adjustable power and looks make it effective as both a spotter scope, and of course, the intimidation factor.
10/22 Stocks: This rifle is built to drop straight into a 10/22 stock, some might require fitting but for the most part, it'll be a perfect fit without any trouble. The only thing you may have to do is remove any threaded bushing in the stock, or slightly open up the hole.
All-in-one: Unlike most paintball 'rifle' builds that require the use of a remote line to a tank on the users back, this rifle is completely self sustainable. a small co2 tank is mounted under the stock and can feed the rifle for more than enough shots for a day of play or so.
The feedtube: It can be loaded by hand, or through the use of ten round tubes sort of like stripper clips work. I have some of these.

The bad stuff:
The finish is flaking with age, if you dont like that look, you may wish to repaint it.
Due to its conversion, it can be a little finicky on occasion and will not fire, this is almost always remidied by barely unscrewing the screw  pictured. Over tightening this screw binds something in the action, this is not uncommon for automags in general however.
The Stock has seen better days, its a little wobbly in the rear end due to it being a rather cheap ATI stock thats been tapped for screws to secure the air tank, and the screw that holds the action into it had pulled through before I purchased it, I have remedied this with a small plate under it that secures it fine however.
The feed tube, due to it being cut down at some point, has not had the back cap pinned into place, I never did it because I had intentions to return it to its original length but never did to due to a theft in my shop.
The trigger guard is just, well, ugly. Its a piece of thin aluminum cut and bent into shape, rather crude, but ultimately effective.
The tape, is simply for looks and to make it a little easier to grasp, the bit on the stock however is covering a hole I filled in, at some point the previous owner attempted to route the air through the stock for some reason. 

A warning about owning Automags: They have a completely dead trigger until gas is applied, its not broken, its just how they all work.

Want a full setup? Add 50 and I've got a nice mask and a great camo pouch and belt.

For those of you that are familiar with this weapon, company or the owner I dont need to say anything more than this weapon holds true to the Tac. Ops. standard. For the rest of you allow me to reassure you that this is one of the finest weapons I have shot. It is short, compact, the work on it is outstanding with a crisp trigger pull of 2.5 LBS along with accuracy repeatability that is unmatched. The action is a smooth as can be and the bolt knob makes cycling the weapon a breeze.

This weapon is Sub MOA all day! The best I have managed to do with it is just around half MOA (but I just recently got in to the precision rifle arena so I'm sure many of you can do much better than me). Mike R.(the builder) managed a .156 group with it and I have proof of that. This weapon has exactly 181 flawless rounds of match grade ammo through it. As all of my weapons it has been kept in immaculate condition.

I am in somewhat of a hurry and will post a pic of a Tac. Ops. Tango 51 from the internet but for those of you that email me you will get a picture of the actual weapon.

Only the rifle is for sale, included will be the base and rings, nothing else.

Thanks for your time Gents and possibly Ladys

-
For those of you that are familiar with this weapon, company or the owner I dont need to say anything more than this weapon holds true to the Tac. Ops. standard. For the rest of you allow me to reassure you that this is one of the finest weapons I have shot. It is short, compact, the work on it is outstanding with a crisp trigger pull of 2.5 LBS along with accuracy repeatability that is unmatched. The action is a smooth as can be and the bolt knob makes cycling the weapon a breeze.

This weapon is Sub MOA all day! The best I have managed to do with it is just around half MOA (but I just recently got in to the precision rifle arena so I'm sure many of you can do much better than me). Mike R.(the builder) managed a .156 group with it and I have proof of that. This weapon has exactly 181 flawless rounds of match grade ammo through it. As all of my weapons it has been kept in immaculate condition.

I am in somewhat of a hurry and will post a pic of a Tac. Ops. Tango 51 from the internet but for those of you that email me you will get a picture of the actual weapon.

Only the rifle is for sale, included will be the base and rings, nothing else.

Thanks for your time Gents and possibly Ladys

****The rifle is identical in appearance to the one in the picture except without the pistol grip and forearm texturing. Also, mine has a black stock that was built by Mike****"

This is a Russian 1943 ""Trials"" M44 Carbine Izhevsk Arsenal which is nice condition
It is all matching: Rifle, Bolt, Magazine Floor Plate and Metal Butt Plate
Only 50, 000 of these were produced in 1943 for testing in the fields. 
Full production began in 1944 and continued through 1948

Rifle is in good plus condition with which I'd say 90% or better in the finish
Bore is Bright, but semi-shiny, which I would venture to say has some
frosting to it. Lands & Grooves look good.

Stock has its small little normal wear dings or scratches but solid.
Bayonet fits snug and tight.
Sling is Russian with strong and faded markings. Which to me appears
as a 43' and a 39' date.
Rifle is counterbored, but is a good shooter Ive gotten nice groupings 
with it. I have fired 25 rds through it to test functionality and did not
have any problems.

I am looking to trade for: 

.22 cal Military Trainers (US, Polish, Romanian, Russian, etc)

C&R Military Pistols (Polish, Romanian, Russian etc) or ??

391,http://www.armslist.com/posts/458391,For Sale:  Winchester Black Talon 9mm (The True Story),"Eldred, North Central, PA, Pennsylvania",$ 45,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 25, 2012",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is two boxes of Winchester Black Talon 9mm Luger 147 Gr. SXT Deep Penetrator ammunition 20 cartridges to a box. Originally designed and released in 1991 this cartridge was the first to include a pre-scored jacket. It also included a reverse taper design which allowed it's signature talons to be released perpendicular to the bullet upon impact. The black color of the bullet comes from the oxidized copper jacket and the LubaLox coating which was new for Winchester at the time. LubaLox protects the rifling of the barrel as well as provides lubrication for the bullet while traveling the length of the barrel. It is still used on many of their cartridges today minus the black color. In all Black Talon was cutting edge technology for it's time, thee best hollow point on the market. After a few mass shootings Black Talon proved it's effectiveness but in an unfortunately negative light. Without even being on the market for two years Winchester decided it was in the company's best interest to pull the Black Talon line in 1993. However the Black Talon bullet was re-incarnated into brass casings and sold in boxes of 50 to law enforcement only up until 2000 under the name Ranger SXT which stood for (Supreme eXpansion Talon) but the media once again criticized the ""Talon"" name into nonexistence and it became known as (Supreme eXpansion Technology) a much more ""politically correct"" term. Although the Black Talon's days seemed over Winchester released a new cartridge in 2009 following the design nearly identically with some modern advancements. This new cartridge which was also part of the Supreme Elite Series, same as the Black Talon is know as PDX1. PDX1 is debatablely one of the best cartridges on the market today, so much so that it is the ammunition of choice by the FBI. So what it comes down to is own a piece of Winchester history for $45 a box. I will also ship UPS with tracking for $5 more. I hope you at least found my ad informative, thanks for looking."

The stock has been refinished and is in very good shape compared to most type 53 stocks.  These type 53's have very beat up looking stocks because they used soft chu wood so that the wood would resist jungle rot which is a big concern in asia i guess.  I also have a finn m39 up for sale which i can bundle with this to make the right deal.  Im just looking to thin my bolt gun collection a bit since it has gotten a bit out of control.

It has a 10 round magazine and 13 round magazine with extension that makes it a full size grip. Comes with everything factory, case. manual, XD gear (holster, mag carrier, mag loader).

I recently had this Cerakoted by a gunsmith here for fathers day, the slide, slide release, and take down lever have all been Cerakoted in Tungsten Gray, the frame is all black factory. This gun LOOKS AWESOME with the two-tone look. 

If you break this down in cost it figures like this. 

This gun is $529+tax new (obviously I'm not asking that for it)
Cerakote finish $175

So I have about $725 in this and I am asking $575 cash or $600 trade value. 



I will accept all trade offers, STRONGLY prefer semi-autos and must be like new. TOP trade offer would be Glock models of some sort, must be like new with no wear, and must be a Gen 3 model. Or other top trade would be a Smith and Wesson M&P full size in .40 like new. All offers must include extras such as extra mags, ammo, night sights, ect. depending on trade value.

Dirty old can of Milsurp stuff, from the looks of it. When through and counted/cleaned the rounds with a total of 180 rounds and 5 stripper clips. The rounds are stamped WCC and various other things, dating from around 58-81 for the most part. Not sure about any specifics apart from that, since they were for my Grandfather's old rifle, and I don't have the proper gun for this kind of ammo. Hence the selling and at a bit lower price than the usual milsurp stuff. Got a few photos here of the ammo, and I'll be tossing the can they were stored in as well. The can is not the actual can they came in, Im sure. I just use the old thing for storage (since its a 7.62 can). Though the can may look a little low, its 180 rounds all down in there. Feel free to email me any questions and I will answer them as best I can, but I have little more information than what is here. Not sure about the grain count or corrosive/non-corrosive. Price is firm, and what you do with the ammo after purchase is your choice. Just trying to make something out of it.

Walther PPS is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses modified Browning type locking with tilting barrel. Frame of the gun is made from impact resistant polymer. Trigger is of double action only type, striker fired, with pre-cocked striker system, similar to QA system used in Walther P99 pistols. This system requires a manual recocking (by partial slide retraction) in the case of misfire.

For sale is a very uncommon Ruger in .357 Maximum (not Magnum, but will shoot them) with the even more uncommon 10.5"" barrel.
The 357 Maximum is .400"" longer than the 357 Magnum, delivering up to 400 more ft/lbs of energy.
The Maximum is just a longer version of the Magnum and it will shoot those and 38 Special rounds.
This caliber Ruger was produced for only a couple of years before it was shuffled into obscurity because loads using 125 grain bullets that would do flame cutting into the top strap through the b/c gap.
Rounds should have 158 grain or larger bullets to avoid a deep flame cut.
Years later it was eventually found that even with 125 grain bullets the cut created would not grow any more, and that did not weaken the structure of the gun.

This gun is obviously a long enough barrel for hunting with plenty of power.
If you are looking for one to do silhouette shooting - look no further; that's what this was designed for.
The trigger pull has been significantly lightened to fit with the length/weight combination and provide much tighter groups.
With over a foot of distance between the sights, I have no trouble grouping at 100 yards.
One final note on this baby is that it is the only one John Linebaugh can convert to the 475 or 500 Linebaugh Long.

The second picture shows my ability with it from 100 yards standing...

I will require proof of residency for a FTF sale by Drivers License or State Identification card and will provide a bill of sale (copies for each).

**  Final note:  The ammo is hand-loaded and is included to provide .357 Maximum brass.  Use at your own risk."

Here is a rare AMT (Galena) Automag IV 45 Winchester Magnum

This one is in excellent condition and runs like a champ!
There is some light wear on the bottom forward section of the slide like it was shot off a bag.
(A bag is not needed; I shoot/practice with my AM IV's standing, both single and double handed at 50 yards.)
This one has a 6"" barrel to be legal for handgun hunting (in most places) and plenty of power to take down deer or piggies.
The 45 Win Mag (in my opinion) is around the largest and most manageable of the big bore semi-auto's. 
Because it is a 100% stainless steel semi-auto (about 3.25 lbs unloaded), felt recoil is less than that of most 44 Magnum revolvers.
Ammo is commercially available; I've seen it on shelves and many places online.

If you reload here is some information...
Rounds use the same bullet as 45 Colt, CH/4D had dies on the shelf and new Starline brass is readily available.
(You really you only need a resizing die for 45 Win Mag; 45/454/460 dies work for all others.)

I began building this rifle at the first of the year and finished it late February.  It has been fired and zeroed in with approximately 250-300 rounds down range.  Absolutely no problems at all.  Excellent rifle just not practical for me at this time.  Am selling to purchase a handgun and long rifle for home defense and hunting/target purposes respectively.

I am open to reasonable offers. I paid nearly $1800 to build this rifle and know given the upcoming election that you couldn't come close to getting all the bells and whistles for this price if at all.

 I have all receipts and boxes that all parts were shipped in if you would like those.

Without red dot and magnifier $1250.

Here are a few of the questions we have designed the Defensive Pistol course curriculum to specifically address: 

• Do I know what type of people commit crimes, how they commit them, who they commit them against, and how to spot tell-tale signs of a crime about to happen? 
•Is my pistol a defensive tool I know how to competently operate, or am I merely expecting its mere presence and noise when fired to stop an attack? 
•Am I a good enough shot to consistently hit what I'm aiming at without endangering those around me? 
•What if one or two shots aren't enough to stop an assailant? What if ten shots isn't enough? 


COURSE OVERVIEW: 

Defensive Pistol 1 is one full day of training including lecture, practical exercises, and live fire on the range. Many courses are focused on the needs of law enforcement and military. This pistol-focused class is designed for people who want to acquire real-world defensive pistol skill sets designed specifically for civilian carry.


YOU WILL LEARN: 

•How to select an appropriate firearm 
•How to manipulate your firearm as a defensive tool 
•How to shoot accurately and consistently and how to speed up consistent accuracy 
•Quickly clearing malfunctions when your firearm experiences them 

YOU WILL NEED: 

•A semi-automatic pistol and at least 2 magazines 
•200 rounds of ammunition
 •Ear and eye protection 
•A folding camp chair for your comfort 
•Money for lunch/bring your lunch 
•Proper attire for the weather and conditions 
•A hat and/or sunscreen is advisable 

***Please Note: all below equipment is available for rental/purchase as needed - try before you buy! Don't let a lack of gear stop you from taking this class!!!***

In self-defense, we only get one chance to do it right: the first time. We need to find out the realities of self-defense in a safe, controlled training environment where we get a ""do-over"" when our preparations or equipment fails. We do NOT want to find out what doesn't work in a dirty mall parking lot where failure means serious bodily harm or even death; we would much rather discover those deficiencies in our preparation and equipment in training so we won't have to fail when it matters! 

You will never be set up to fail in this course. Our staff is certified, friendly, competent, proficient, fun, and professional. This course is designed to improve you from the very first moment you step in our door, starting from any skill level, with your own equipment, because the edge that you acquire from training will translate to a life-saving difference when it matters most. Pay attention in class, apply what you learn, and you will succeed in every single exercise!"

I am looking for a complete, working Bryco 38 (blued). I have one that I acquired from a friend that needed cash (yes I know you will all say ""wow, some friend for selling you this""). Yes, I felt bad. We all know the ""always down on his luck"" kind of guy that must sell stuff to live. Anyway, I took it off his hands in 04 and now it has a crack in it (surprise surprise). It has a small crack forming in the strap that holds the barrel in place. I am looking for either an intact, undamaged frame, or a whole working gun. The local gun store I have been buying and selling at since 1999 told me to give it to the City of Chicago the next time they do their gun buyback program to get guns off the streets. He is probably right as I cannot in good conscience ever sell it to another private party and from what I have found it seems no gun store will touch these with a ten foot pole.

988,http://www.armslist.com/posts/458988,"For Sale:  Very Nice 2009 Chevy Silverado Crew Cab 19,600 Miles","Gastonia, Charlotte, North Carolina","$ 29,500","Listed On: Friday, March 8, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"as I grew up I used to trade in trucks every year, sometimes life throws you curve's they don't expect. I guess at this point I simply can't afford this much truck. My wife and I are separating.
so to be a man of honor. I would like to sell the truck and find something more affordable for me. Right now I simply can't handle the truck payment.

So what you see in the photos is 2009 Chevy Silverado.
and just being straight up honest with you, which you can count on. This truck was one that I had intended to pay off and keep knowing as I got older having no payment and very dependable vehicle, especially one as nice as this, would be great for me. I've never been one to buy four-wheel drives. Every single time I have done that I cursed has no snow fell.

We just don't live in an area where I see it being important. So my last two trucks have been 2 Wheel Drives.

I only preface that so you will know why I now see that I can keep it. There is nothing wrong with it. I just can't keep it. So my goal would be to get payoff for it. I will be glad to discuss that with you if you are interested, I also have shots of the window sticker and would be very happy to show you the vehicle.

I bought this truck and 2009 in it only has 19,600 miles.
The biggest blemish or issue with the whole truck is a simple spot just beneath the driver seat IN the carpet in the rear of the floormat. Just due to pain how I ride in the car I keep my foot back there and it did wear a spot
.A nice set of floorboard liners will take care that pretty easy.

Outside the truck there may be a few small scratches and paint due to those morons we all know won't part far enough away from your vehicle to properly open their door. But this truck is super clean and in very good condition.
 I'm just being straight up about what I know is there

I had a Bednrug in the back of it. Also had a snug top on the back. So the paint in the bid is immaculate. 

Other than that the truck really seriously is in excellent shape. I don't have a lot of cash right now but I did take it and get it cleaned up so that you can see how nice it looks.

 The difference in this truck and a stock truck is a $2400 set of wheels. they are slightly offset just enough to look good, no teenage crap."
