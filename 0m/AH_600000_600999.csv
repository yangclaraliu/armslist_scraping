I just took the picture while it was laying in the case. Sorry for the confusion. For sale is my Ruger 10/22, shot twice with less than 200 through it. Tapco adjustable stock with rails. 3X9 scope. Factory 10rd. Mag and 2 30rd mags. I still have the original box and stock. Original stock was removed the moment I got home with it so its new unused. Shoots great. No issues with the gun. The new mags need to be broken in. They're tight and hang up sometimes. I just never got around to running a bunch of rounds through them. $350obo. I'm not very flexible though. This rifle is perfect and the ONLY reason I'm selling is to pick up a Henry rifle. Been wanting one for awhile. Feel free to text me at REDACTED. I work varying schedules so just text anytime and ill respond as soon as I can. I prefer texts. I would be willing to trade for a Henry Golden Boy in .22LR. No variants though.

Rifle has a built-in 5 round magazine and has been outfitted with a Tasco 3-9X32 power scope. This Mauser has the desirable Colombian crest engraved just forward of the bolt. The Colombian's during the war were issued European 7mm Mausers in which they converted to the readily available American 30-06 round. This rifle would be the ultimate hunting rifle for the upcoming deer and elk season. There is one slight hiccup with the rifle though. Once the chambered round is fired, it is slightly difficult to open the bolt back up. (Some shots required the use of two hands to open the bolt) I've had the fired brass evaluated, and been told this is a head-spacing issue with the barrel, and that I myself, or a gunsmith, should fix this by reaming the barrel. I am not particularly interested in spending the time to get this rifle in perfect condition. I would like to add that it does shoot and operate as it should, just definitely not as smooth or safe as it should be. It is extremely accurate and was hitting clay pigeons at 200 yards last weekend. Also included with the rifle, is approx. 90 rounds or so of new Lake City 150gr 30-06 rounds. The action on this rifle is a European FN action and is highly sought after to be used in high-end custom sporterized rifles because it is fully capable of handling any round available; including the high powered 300 win mag or 300 weatherby rounds. The action alone is worth $200 and the ammo itself is worth easily $100...so please no low ball offers. I would prefer to actually trade. I'm looking for anything and everything. Shoot me a trade offer, the worst I can do is politely say ""no thanks."""

All of these guns are great and shoot perfectly! I am looking for something different and am tired of storing these guns that I never shoot. Please help me get rid of them.

-Winchester 1200 magnum. Chambered for 2 ¾ - 3” magnum shells. Barrel has been sawed off to the minimum legal length – 18 ½”. The barrel has been painted high heat flat black. Frame is aluminum and has been polished to a mirror-like finish. All components and parts have been reblued and are corrosive resistant. It has a new trigger, sear assembly, and trigger guard. These parts cost a total of $60. It also has an Advanced Technologies Inc. (ATI) 6 position collapsible, tactical pistol grip stock – valued at $60. I just recently purchased a magazine tube extension for a 7 + 1 round capacity - $20. Haven’t shot it with the new magazine extender, but the barrel lines up perfectly with it. Also comes with all the original parts including the accessories to fit the pistol grip on a Remington 870 or Mossberg. Also comes with a SPEEDFEED stock, which aren’t cheap! Even comes with a nylon, 5 shell stock holder and a box of 3” magnum shells! I have all receipts. Valued at: $400

-Marlin 39-A lever action .22 rifle. Has a weaver ¾” detachable scope. I checked to serial numbers on this gun and it is an antique – made in 1947! Good condition for a ’47. You would not believe it by the looks of it, I know I didn’t! Valued at: $500

SIG556, Pre-ban Colt Ar15, Colt Comp HBAR are all for sale.  The next 3 going to the right are, Colt HbarII, AR-10, 10/22 are already sold.  SORRY

The story behind this Pre-ban Ar15 was that the first few thousand of these Colt LightWeight Sporters were allocated to the NY State Gov. Bunker. Where they sat for years until after the ban.  

These have the M16 Bolt Carrier for Automatic use. Combined with a 1:7 twist rate makes these rifles a hot commodity.  The late models have inferior bolt carrier with exposed firing pins.
 (This is reflected in the extremely low serial number)  So the story goes..  

This is an NOS (new old stock) 1992 Blue Label Ar15 Colt L.W. Sporter, NEW IN BOX with all original packaging, box, and paperwork. NEVER EVER FIRED!!!!!

Let's not forget this rifle has a 1:7 twist rate.!!!  That means you can stabilize heavier bullets like, Sniper Rounds, or heavy hunting loads. 62-75 grains NO Problem at all.  1:9 twists shoot these grains like crap.

Im asking $1,740 and thats what I paid. I still have receipt to show proof. 

  Google search this gun.  Do your Homework, and you will find this rifle in this condition sell from $1700-$2,200. Depends on State and region.   Condition is everything.  Mine in MINT, 99.9% MINT.  

 Some guys even ask these prices without the boxes or even magazines, just the gun! They demand a premium for sure.  

$1750 is my rock bottom low.  It's an Investment for sure. 

Understand what you are buying.  I don't ever buy cheap or economic anything, especially guns.   You get what you pay for. 

 Condition is EVERYTHING! NO RUST! NO SCRATCHES!

I probably shot 100 rounds through it, and found it extremely accurate and reliable. Have switched to a different platform so it needs to go.

This is a very nice Chinese SKS rifle chambered in 7.62x39mm, Chinese State Arsenal 974. Sling, Cleaning Rod, and Cleaning Kit are included. Rifle is in Very Good+ condition relative to surplus Chi-Com rifles. It has a few of  the ""usual"" small stock dents and scratches that are very common for SKS' from import handling.  As the pics will attest, rifle is in V.G.+ to Exc. Condition.

  Note: This rifle has the Bayonet Pin/Rivet, instead of the screw. The pin/rivet does slide out to remove the bayonet, if you want to. I prefer this type of bayo connection. 

  $300.00 cash FTF for the rifle. If I have to ship, that will cost +$30.00.  The UPS shipping always costs me around $22-$23 and the only UPS hub around here is 20 miles one way, thus the extra $8 for a whopping 2 gallons of gas. If there's anyone in a $300.00 FTF buy interest, I live in the SW Missouri area, Springfield, Branson, or Branson West areas.

The solution to these problems is an intermediate rate of twist, and 1 in 11.25"" appears to be the perfect compromise for optimum accuracy with both 40 and 60 grain bullets.

This barrel is a .920"" OD heavy match profile, 16.75"" long stainless 6-groove barrel. It is designed to stabilize Aguila SSS 60 grain ammunition without degrading the accuracy of standard 40 grain projectiles.  I bought this for a 10/22 project which I've abandoned for an AR-15 build.  I'll include with the barrel at this price a new in the wrapper Select Fire Black Diamond Tool Steel extractor and spring and firing pin and spring, a $21 dollar value.  Also, this is the more sought after barrel because the muzzle is threaded 1/2-28, so you can add a brake or can.  Never been on a rifle, so contact me if you want to take a look.

With all due respect to Sir Newton, the KRISS engineers have been able to use his law to the shooter’s advantage. Unlike any other firearm ever invented, instead of having all the recoil force slam back into the shooter’s shoulder, causing massive amounts of felt recoil and resultant muzzle climb, the Kriss-USA System absorbs and redirects these forces downward and away from the operator thus enabling him to better control and keep the KRISS firearm on-target. More control equals more rounds on-target, more of the time. 

Kriss-USA Super V SBR/SO Features:

* Ambidextrous bolt release lever, fire controls, and magazine release 
* Closed Bolt, Delyaed Blowback, Semi-auto Patented Super V System

Been thinking listing this for over a year....finally decided
This 1911 was manufactured in West Hurley, New York by Auto Ordinance  Corporation.......It is not a Kahr manufactured

When I listed this, I did a search on armslist....could not find another listing
for this 1911

Has the Thompson Logo on the Slide....same as on the Tommy Gun...
looks like a bullet outline with name ""Thompson"" inside the outline

Parkerized finish....My photos show off color, but
that is just the photo and reflection of my garage lights overhead...
the gun is flawless

The only upgrade I did to this is the Wilson Combat guide rod and barrel
bushing(Shok-Buff Recoil System $38.99 Midway)  I have the original bushing, spring  and Thompson Grips(the grips are like new...no wear....grips are perfect) I did install a buffer, came with the upgrade
I did install the Pachmayr grips($34.99 Midway), that wrap around to the front of the hand part of the frame.

comes with the original magazine, when I purchased

The gun has never been internally polished or messed with.....original...
just maintained and cleaned

Maybe shot 200-300 rounds in the last 12 years thru this gun.....most 
lead round nose....no wear on barrel......no cycling issues

All for $600.00 fairly firm, but U can make reasonable offer...considered

trade for Masterpiece Arms(Mac 10) style 45ACP or
any other tactical pistol....no wheel guns...no shotguns....no Glocks

For sale is my Wyoming Arms Parker.  The Wyoming Arms Parker is a single action gun somewhat similar to a 1911 Government Model. Two major differences, however, are the elimination of the grip safety and the use of a slide mounted rather than frame mounted manual safety. The Parker can still be carried with the hammer cocked and the safety engaged, but the slide can still be operated so it can't truly be considered ""cocked-and-locked"" when in this mode.

As you may know the conversion kit was limited production and very hard to find.I'm looking to trade and only looking for something in a 22lr tactical...something like a ruger 10/22 archangel with the AR conversion look.A MP 22 tactical etc..Although I like the beretta and the wife loves it even more I want something that looks more aggressive rather than just cool..and since this is a name brand Beretta I'm not looking for cheap Chinese knock offs...that pretty much leaves the ruger 10/22 tactical...or something just as dependable.I have about 600.00 invested in the gun and conversion kit so I'm not looking for a cheap trade.Go check out the Beretta NEOS...its a real unique gun.Also..both the gun and carbine kit come in their original boxes with all the paper work.So keep in mind that this is actually TWO guns in one..A pistol and a long distance shooting riffle all in one.
