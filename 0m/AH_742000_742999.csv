This rifle is double digit serial number, Yes two number serial. Rifle was used by Century arms as their Display rifle and submitted at the 2009 Shot Show. This rifle is immaculate, and comes with all prominence proving the rifle was the display rifle including the red tag placed around trigger guard with the shot show markings and the original owners manual. This rifle is chambered in 8MM mauser and the glass is in fantastic condition. This rifle is milled w/ tapered heavy BBL and threaded for suppressor. Other than looks it has nothing in common with a Dragonuv or PSL and far out classes them. Standard effective range of 850 Meters with decent shooters out to over 1,000 with a trained shooter is normal for this rifle. The barrel is heavy BBL unlike the Dragonuv or PSL and the receiver is milled not stamped cheaply like the Dragunov and PSL with a beautiful smooth finish. 
The scope was designed by the Russians as a passive IR detection scope meaning that the radioactive materials in the scope can detect IR light. The scope was used to look for snipers at night that used IR illuminated night vision without giving away the Russian snipers position as the Russian scope detects IR light and doesn't emit it. This is a Counter Sniper Rifle. Designed as such from the factory. This rifle is currently used by Russia, Croatia, Kosovo, Czech Republic, Romania, Bosnia and North Korea.

One picture is from gunshow review of the exact rifle for sale that was shown in the magazine, Picture was taken at ShotShow, this picture is of the actual rifle being sold that was presented by Century Arms to represent their brand to the public and dealers alike. 

You must have AZ drivers License, CCW or Military I.D a plus but not required. Can provide a Bill of Sale if you wish and show AZ drivers License and Military I.D on my end. I am the original and only owner of this rifle."

Also included is a Leupold Mark 4 in a Larue SPR mount, details below. I am the second owner of this firearm. Since owning this, I have put approximately 120 rounds down the barrel. I believe the previous owner shot it maybe 200-300 rounds. I want to go back to a lightweight 14.5-16"" carbine and keep my bolt guns for long range stuff. However, this rifle has done great at distance. I recently shot it in a precision rifle match where it performed flawlessly from 200-600 meters. I haven't developed a load for this yet. I do know 77gr SMKs shoot very well out of this, particularly FGMM 77gr. The firearm has been painted with Krylon in shades of tan, works very well in the plains areas for coyotes and varmints.

This is the Troy Battle Rifle that was being sold exclusively at Dicks Sporting Goods. I HAVE NOT FIRED THIS RIFLE AT ALL! Since Dicks has pulled all AR's off the shelves, this is no longer available. I do still have the box and the signed limited edition certificate that goes with it as well. I don't need to sell it, if I can get what I want, then it is yours. I have done some mods to the rifle:

Ergo grip
BCM Gunfighter Charging Handle
Ambi-Safety
ASAP Plate
Troy 2"" Rail 
Troy Squid Grips
Stock has been repinned professionally
Rifle will come will come with the 10rd Troy Magazine

Here is your chance to own a limited edition built AR before the laws are passed.  No shipping--only face to face sale. 

With the recent turn of events, I am seeing garbage AR-15's (Delton, M&P Sporter, Bushmaster entry level, etc) sell for $1700-$2000. Get something that is actually quality that will retain it's value and shoots well.

Will consider partial trades for:  M&P9c, M&P45c, M&P45, Sig Sauer MK25, Sig Sauer Carry Scorpion, Mossberg 930SPX, Mossberg 590A1, Remington 870 Tactical (one with tactical choke).  I do have my NYS pistol permit--so I can LEGALLY own pistols.

LMT is a manufacturer of some of the highest quality rifles in the world, and contracts to manufacture armaments for the U.S. Military, the British Military & many other military units worldwide. Do your research and you'll discover how good LMT is.

Why pay $2,500 to $3,000 for a lesser quality AR15 such as a Bushmaster, DPMS or Smith & Wesson, many of which are even now listed at such prices as used, when you can own THE BEST, new in box, PLUS 6 brand new 30 round PMAGs (black in color) for the same price?

If you're on the fence, YOU'D BETTER HURRY, given the very real potential that you may not be able to purchase rifles like these in the near future.

This is a brand new, never fired, LMT Defender 2000 5.56 Caliber AR-15 with the excellent 6 position SOPMOD adjustable stock and flip up LMT rear sights.

Good condition, very little finish wear.  I'm surprised there's any finish wear, because this rifle has been treated very well.  Arsenal just has poor finishes.  Mild corrosion on muzzle break.  Internals, gas tube, gas block, and barrel were thoroughly cleaned after each range trip.  No corrosion anywhere but the break.  About 800 rounds through the rifle without a single problem.  The front sight post is slightly canted to the right (what the fuck Arsenal?).  I only just recently noticed this on my most recent range trip.  I'm going to call Arsenal and see if I can get this fixed for free.

Anyways..

1983 (That's apparently vintage now) Remington 700 BDL ""Custom Deluxe"" in .300 Winchester Magnum.

Great condition. Has not been shot more than a box or so of ammo.

93% Condition, if not better. This gun has never seen the truck, field or a rain.

I tried to take pictures of what little imperfections that age and sitting in a safe can cause and I couldn't pick them up. You won't see them either.

I had sighted it in, and was shooting slightly better than 1inch groups consistently with a Nikon prostaff scope. I'm not what I would call a skilled shooter either.

As you can see, it comes with some extras that are well over $100 a hardshell foam padded case. A box of Federal Power-Shok ammo, high quality scope rings (I believe they were Leupold), and scope bases. Comes with a extra Weaver scope base, in case you want to mount the scope less further back. 

It has a jeweled bolt, and you can see it hasn't seen much action. 

The wood on this gun is absolutely beautiful, second only to a Weatherby Mark V Sporter. 

My pictures just don't do it justice. It just has a very nice luster to it, and the blueing is nice and deep.. they just simply don't make them quite as nice these days. 

More pictures here.. http://s5.beta.photobucket.com/user/GWARGHOUL/library/guns4sale

You can take just about any game in North America, and a lot of larger game on other continents with this, yet its not too bad to shoot. I used a limbsaver recoil pad, and it was pretty smooth.

The trigger is good, not too soft, not to heavy, its in the ""sweet spot, no creep, and very crisp. The action is smooth as butter. The front and rear sight were removed, but the original screws are there and they look new just like the rest of the gun. The sights are available from several sources for around $20.

They don't make these anymore, but you can get one from me.

I'm asking $600 obo.

I am willing to ship, buyer pays cost.

I'm located just south of Saint Louis, MO in Festus, MO.

FTF is preferred, but I have no hesitations to ship to a FFL. I have good feedback here, and on gun broker.
Checks are probably the best method of payment, or postal money order. Safest for both parties.

With this multi-cal lower you can build any AR type caliber upper available like 22lr, .223, 5.56, 5.7 FN, 6.8, 7.62x39 (AR10), 300 aac blackout, etc.  I am accepting cash offers or trade ideas. Do not bother me with low ball offers or cheap, no name equipment. Either you are seriously wanting an AR or you aren't. I don't have to sell and I may carry it to the C&E Gun Show in Hickory next weekend to see what I can get for it or trade offers. Any sale or trade must be done legally with a person who can legally own firearms."

Cuomo has stated that outright CONFISCATION of these weapons may be an option, FORCED buy-backs may be an option, or FORCED registration/permits may be an option.

*Remember registration always leads to confiscation (history proves this to a degree).

Do NOT let this happen & please do NOT comply if the above occurs. Spread the word and convince anyone you know with an ""assault"" weapon not to comply if this comes to fruition. They can't physically arrest and make felons of 10's-of-thousands or 100's-of-thousands of New Yorkers.

If you're a LEO, National Guard soldier/reservist, or in the Military PLEASE back your community's people in the event that this occurs. Do not comply with these outrageous propositions if they become a reality.

It's absolutely unethical that these politicians with suits & a pen think they can deny another human being the right to adequately defend themselves in their own home. A human being defending themselves has every right in doing so, to possess a firearm capable of accepting magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.

Beyond an individuals right to defend life (with more than 10 rounds), it's also absolutely unethical for the state to forcibly confiscate the equity that an individual possesses in these assets.

The SuperCell recoil pad tames hard-hitting slug rounds with unmatched efficiency.

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine.

Our latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips, and the Impact/Dust Cover can now be snapped onto the floorplate when not in use to prevent possible loss. Along with larger windows and round count numbers on the body, the PMAG MagLevel's stainless steel magazine spring is now coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color.

Straight talk, real talk. Prices are still going up. This will not last at this price. If you are sitting on the fence I suggest you decide before the next round of increases. The $2000 guns from last week are bringing $3000. They are expensive but available now; better than totally unavailable later. Or the prices may drop as fast as they rose. I don't know. You roll the dice.

I wish I had bought gold at $300/ounce. I did not and the price went up to current market values. I have always maintained that the price of these Colt's with restricted roll marks would sky rocket but no one believed me and yet here is the proof. Type in ""colt restricted"" in the search block to see current market prices. I am not asking top dollar but current market value.

If you believe in the free market and want a quality AR collectible at a fair market price, buy this. It is a COLT with Colt heritage, and Colt quality. It is not some frankenAR slapped together in a machine shop or basement by some guy who has never before installed a trigger group. There is a reason they say ""never fired"" in those listings, they are afraid to. My price is firm and non-negotiable. Please do your homework prior to contacting me. Only compare apples to apples, not Colt SP1 prices without roll marks. You will see this is a good deal in today's market.

I deal in cash, FTF, and require a Concealed Carry Permit or Pistol Permit, NC ID and a signed Bill of Sale.
