23,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5023,Star progressive loading machines and accessories,"Edm, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma","$ 8,000","Listed On: Saturday, March 28, 2009",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"If someone wants to get into heavy production of ammo but can't afford a fully automatic machine, even if one were for sale on the market, this is the next best thing.  Star progressive loaders perform all the steps of the reloading process in one stroke of a lever.  some folks have even operated the lever by foot with additional linkages.  The operator just stands there and introduces the bullet each stroke.  The primers, powder and cartridge cases are all introduced automatically.  If there is an assistant, perhaps a spouse, the magazines of primers and other components can be fed into the operation as needed.  Each individual  basic machine costs over a thousand.  Then there are additional dies for various calibers, spare  parts that wear faster than others, and other supporting equipment.   In all, a person winds up with just over 2 thousand per machine.  That's where I am now.  I load for .38/.357, 9mm, 10mm, .44, 45/45acp.  I can even set up two machines to produce the same caliber when the added volume is needed, provided there is someone there to run it.  So, there you have it.  Since it is not fully automatic, it costs less than an automatic machine.    However, it is much more flexible than a fully automatic machine.  These machines have been produced by Star for at least 40 years.  They are reliable and stout.  The company still produces them.  The demand for these will continue to grow as long as those who believe in the Second Amendment hunker down for what is inevitable under Democratic domination.  Check the shelves at most retailers - there is no ammo gathering dust.  So there you have it.  Because of my age and other activities I am getting out of this business.  If a person isn't going to have around 10  thousand for this equipment, powder, primers, cases and bullets, then they need not entertain any thoughts of getting into this business.  The start up cost is high.  The margin of  profit is becoming huge.  The demand for 9mm alone would  return many times the investment.  As I said ""serious reloading.""   Not for the week end plinker.  If we get together I can discuss powder, primers, cases and bullets."

 this is basically a brand new kel tec slu 223 assult tyoe riffle. a quick google search will let you see exactly what i am offering. this one has no scrathes or marks.  the clips for these guns are compatable with ar 15 clips. so it is a nice cross over or back up riflle, the stock folds over. making it very compact. but one of the best features is the weight.this gun has a carbon fiber stock. it does look weird at first. but once yo hold it for a while you quickly come to realize how nice it is.  i have the original box and paperwork for this gun. it has only been shot 10 times. i did some trading and ended up with this. but i already have a mini 14 and a ar 15. just do not see the need to have three 223 caliber riffles.

  what am i looking for?  
cash would be great. i would take 500.00 cash. 

but in trade i want 550.00 , now the 550.00 is what i think you are trading with.  i had several people offer me sks riffles.  first of all i already have one. and a ak47.. do not need another.. but secondly sks are only worth 250-300.00  i want equal trade. i might consider pistols. but it has to be worth what i am looking for. i do not want 150-200   jenning 22's/25.. or no name 9mm's  i might consider these guns in multiples or with some cash. but straight out trades, no way.

 223 is the hottest round out right now.  i would love to get ahold of some ar 15 accessories in trade. i am also looking for high power hunting riffles.  or maybe even a couple of nice 22 riffles.. 22 mag riffle...( for friends to plunk with)

Mega Lower Reviews

""Better than Colt or DPMS""

Made my decision today and went and picked up my first AR lower. I chose the MEGA ""Gator"" lower after comparing it side by side with some others such as Stag Arms. The machining on this MEGA is awesome. Clean clean clean! No tool marks at all anywhere. The magwell is nicely broached with no marks and the magazine fits nice and snug with no slop like it did in the Stag. The receiver is already milled deep enough to accept the full-auto sear (not that I will use that)."

HERE'S A BACKGROUND ON THE BERETTA 92FS: F Models Also known as the 92SB-F, the model 92 F was developed in 1983 as a further modification of the model 92 SB that featured a slightly reshaped grip, plastic grip panels and a new, more durable finish. The current production version of the 92 F has a double-action first trigger pull, followed by a single-action trigger pull for subsequent rounds. The ""F"" and ""FS"" models have a safety lever that also functions as a decocking lever. The 92 FS was submitted for USA XM9 Army Pistol Trials in 1985 and adopted by the US Army as the M9 Pistol. It is manufactured both in Italy and in USA, and has also been adopted by many other military and law enforcement groups. The 92 FS features a chrome-lined barrel, recurved triggerguard for improved two-handed grip, , Bruniton finish, and trigger bar disconnect safety.

Good bargain semi-auto that's been well cared for. The only problem is, I let a friend borrow the xtra-full turkey choke to use in his Franchi since they are compatible, and he had to use pliers to get it out, so it has some scratches on it. I haven't attempted to use it, so I dont know if it will thread into the Stoeger now. If not, I'm sure you can order one from Stoeger or an aftermarket one for $20-$30. Price is $350 OBO.

There is no way I would part with this impossible to find, recently discontinued, very very popular ammo. However, I need the money.

For those who don't know, Federal American Eagle xm193 is similar to commercial .223 but it is loaded to Mil-spec. (higher pressure) that means we get milspec brass, bullet, and powder load with the reliability the millitary demands. If your Rifle is chambered 5.56 nato then this is the ammo for you. (it will shoot in the .223 chambered rifles also.)

I have spent the last couple of weeks finding and buying all I could. Now I must let some go.

I apologize for the obscene asking price. I am asking for more than last months value because of availability. If you don't like the price make an offer but I am firm on this because it is unreplaceable unless things calm down in the future. Good luck!

I purchased the ammo in 2 large boxes but I took them out and put them in airtight containers so I am selling them in the black 20rnd boxes. They are all the same lot, just not in the big boxes anymore.

shipping will be flat $20.

This is an old bolt action, 13 round tubular magazine 22LR.

I do not know the history or details on the gun. It was a trade with several other items. 

I have been unable to accurately identify it other than a few forums out there and none are specific. 

Unless I'm doing something wrong I am unable to find info even through Remington. 

Other than the Patent #'s, the only identifiers seem to be the 341-P and a 54 stamped on the opposite side of the barrel.   

It is not in mint condition but shoots straight and reliably.

I have torn it down completely to clean it as it was gummed up when I got it. 

During inspection and cleaning found everything very dirty, but tight. 

I have ""lightly"" sanded the stock as it had a few dings in it and I'm picky. I then stained it. 

It does need to be blued to restore it. I did no polishing on the steel to avoid damaging it as the markings are all still clear. 

It is somewhat of a collectors item from what I can gather. 

Overall I would rate it a 5 out of 10 for condition. 

Contact me for more details. 

Have a great day."

661,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5661,WTT Traditions Lightning 45LD Muzzleloader for a Rimfire,"East Wichita, Wichita, Kansas",$ 0,"Listed On: Thursday, April 16, 2009",Firearms,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a muzzleloader up for trade because I never use it and it just sits on the shelf. It is a Traditions Lightning LD in 45 caliber. It has a composite stock and a 26"" nickel fluted barrel. I bought this new for $270 sometime between 00-02 but can't really remember when. I did some range testing of various powder/bullet combos and hunted with it once. It has been fired less than 50 times with all but 1 shot on the range (shot a doe, bang flop). The rifle is in very good condition. The stock has some scuffs and dirt on it, but nothing too bad. The bore looks good with no visible corrosion and the breech is out so you can look at it yourself. I got the best accuracy out of the Powerbelt bullets and 4 pellets, but I can't remember the group sizes. It was somewhere around 2-3"" at 100yds..nothing too impressive, but good enough. Photos below and I can email more if you would like. Here is the original manufacturer's description:

NEW Lightning 45 Long Distance
The new Lightning 45 LD Bolt Action muzzleloader packs all the same quality features as that of our Lightning Mag Bolt Actions. We have extended the barrel out to 26"" for those long shots. The performance barrels are fluted with a new 1 in 20"" twist. The 45 LD offers 3 types of interchangeable ignitions to choose from - 209 shotgun primer, #11 percussion cap and musket cap. The new Thunder Dome Breech Plug which uses the new Thunder Nipples (supplied with all Lightnings) which provides you with a sure-fire ignition with Pellets or loose powder. Tru-Glo Adjustable Fiber Optic Sights are standard and allow for low light hunting conditions. The magnum receiver accepts a 150 grain magnum powder charge (5-.44/.45 caliber Pryrodex Pellets). A solid Aluminum ramrod with a brass loading/cleaning jag, breech plug/nipple wrench, complete instuctions and lifetime warranty information come standard with the Lightning 45 LD muzzleloader.

It's an older Ruger Vaquero in .45 Long Colt. Also has the .45 ACP cylinder with it along with a McKnight Leather Western QUICK DRAW holster rig, original box, original grips, and all paper work. I'm not sure of the round count, but pistol shows very little wheel wear. I believe it's an early 90's model that is safe with hot loads (unlike the majority of the vaqueros). Has Case color reciever and minor holster wear on the tip of barrel. Ajax Staglite grips were also added. Pics don't do it justice. Has some minor holster wear on the end of the barrel. Comes with 1 partial box of 45 lc ammo. This is one NICE RIG!

The ammo is hermetically sealed in 140-round plastic battle packs, each containing seven 20-round pasteboard boxes of loose ammunition. It is non-corrosive and Berdan primed brass cases.
All the battle packs are still sealed and in original condition.
This is a full case, containing 9 battle packs for a total of 1260 rounds of premium zombie killing bang-bang.

This ammo was highly sought-after when it was available, and as it dried up, prices soared. You know you're kicking yourself now for not laying in a few cases, so here's a chance to get your hands on some. South Africa is dumping their remaining supplies AT SEA, so there is no chance you'll ever get this opportunity again.

Buyer will pay ACTUAL shipping costs via carrier of his choice, including all fees. You must pay for insurance, because once I ship this off, it's between you and the carrier if it gets lost. The ammo will be shipped contained in a cardboard box to conceal the nature of the contents.
Payment must be received in full before shipment is made.

I will provide photos of the case and contents to serious bidders on request.

I reserve the right to refuse to sell if the higest price offered does not meet my satisfaction.
I may offer individual 140-round battle packs at a later date if the entire case does not sell, but you will likely save money buying the entire case."

The Davis stock allows you to have different rounds along in the event you decide you need something more apporpriate for the moment.  The rifle sights enable you to put a sabot or rifled slug on a grapefruit at 50 yards.  I will not sell this to anyone who does not have a law enforcement commission or concealed carry license.

All nine of my Sako barreled actions are ""Pre-70""  These are the  premium run of Sakos.  There is a 25% reduction for post '70 Sakos.

In the long action, L61R,  I have the following

.338 mag, magnaported , 24"", standard barrel weight,  SN 64,XXX
.25-06, standard, 24"" barrel length, SN 62,XXX
.270, 24"" barrel length, SN 74,XXX
.30-06,  standard 24"" barrel, SN 46,XXX
.458, Custom Sheiland medium wt barrel,  SN 51,XXX


In the short action, L579R, I have the following

.22-250, Heavy Sako barrel, 23.5""  SN 94,XXX
. 22-250, standard barrel, 23.5""  SN  96,XXX
243 (6mm), custom barrel, SN 49,XXX
.308, standard barrel, 23.5"", SN 80,XXX

I have not been able to get a professional evaluation on these so far.  The current Blue Book shows complete guns in this range right at 1,000 in 100% condition.  Well, these have never been mounted, fired, etc.  They are 100%!  So, I think I will set the opening price at $500 for any of them.   I am going to  put them on Gunbroker soon.  Then I will get a good sense of their value.  I am seeing guns that show a certain value bring about 50% more on Gunbroker.  You never know.  Of course, there are far fewer stock makers than gun buyers."

  this is like brand new. you can search for pics on internet.  they are all pretty standard but hard to find..

 i have seen one that sold less than a month ago on gun broker for 701.00 and on guns america for 750.00..

  i am asking 650.00 .. but i am going to be very clear so please read closely.. 

1.. i do not care that you did a search and saw one for 590.00.. then go buy it.(i see sks with syn folding stocks and bayonets for 250.00..try to buy one. )

2. i will not trade across state lines. this is a in person deal. your money in my hand.my riffle is yours.


 this gun has had about 10-15 shots fired through it,just do not need it.  

 the riffle has a composite stock. making it very light. ( just over 4pounds) and when folded overall length is just under 27 inches.  the front barrel guard can be released so you can use it as a bipod..

 for those who may not do correct search. this is the newer version which does allow you to use the trigger when folded. i have the original box with paperwork. everything here

 i may consider trades if i think it is equal value. i had a few good offers. but nothing that i thought matched.  would prefer the cash. daughter needs braces."
