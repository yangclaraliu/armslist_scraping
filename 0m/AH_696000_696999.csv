The title pretty much sums it up.  This shotgun is in great condition.  It comes with both the ported shot barrel as well as the ported slugster barrel (smooth bore)  The pictures are of the slug barrel as I am just picking up the shot barrel today.  This gun also comes with a brand new turkey choke still in the package.  (I believe it's an undertaker)  I don't have the other chokes on hand but as soon as I find them (if possible) I can be sure and mail them to you after the sale.  Pretty straight forward gun in good shape and considering I just saw one without the slug barrel and all beat up at cabelas for 250 I figure 350 for everything is a fair price but I'm open to offers.

I have shot about 100 rounds through it, just enough to sight it in using 180 grain bullets, 240's hurt too much.

Rifle is in excellent condition
She has held sub 3 inch groups at 100 yards with the right ammo.
I can also confirm she can hit minute of head at 200yards pretty regular with a decent marksman, a 4x scope  and decent ammo. She feed anything I give her without a hiccup. She is sitting at approx 750  round count so her break in is complete and she has her whole service life ahead.   Rifle ergonomics enhanced with a SAW stock and SAW  grips.
She sports a quad rail  hand guard  with vertical and an upgraded compensator. She also has a TWS 1st Gen Dog leg rail with peep sight that STILL allows for Quick AK break down.  1 30  round mag  and tapsco red dot included, the sling is not included. 

She is a great rifle and a fantastic example of an AK done right, Wouldnt sell her but I have a new AK and just bought another toy so I need to make room . 

Just a thought from a Jarhead:

I love my ARs but when the SHTF I WANT an AK. 
If you ever have to use this in defense of your life, real world experience has taught me and the statistics back me up that range is not  generally the deciding  factor, neither is  accuracy as  you'll likely be bobbing and weaving as will the bad guy. Minute of man is just fine.  It comes down to speed of deployment, reliability and the ability to defeat cover.  The 7.62 x39  can engage past 300 yards  but Ill call it a 300 yard round.  That is more than generous in any likely scenario. What it does better than its contemporaries is destroy cover and run where few other systems can.  Neither the 5.56 nor the 5.45 can hope to match the original AK's ability to deny the enemy cover and that's where the fight is won.  Pick the right tool for the job. 

So here are the rules...

I got a magic number in my head a little lower than asking price. , First one to it without haggling gets it. I dont want the hassle of back and forth. Dont lowball me. Serious buyers only.

If you ever have to use this in defense of your life, real world experience has taught me and the statistics back me up that range is not  generally the deciding  factor, neither is  accuracy as  you'll likely be bobbing and weaving as will the bad guy. Minute of man is just fine.  It comes down to speed of deployment, reliability and the ability to defeat cover.  The 7.62 x39  can engage past 300 yards  but Ill call it a 300 yard round.  That is more than generous in any likely scenario. What it does better than its contemporaries is destroy cover and run where few other systems can.  Neither the 5.56 nor the 5.45 can hope to match the original AK's ability to deny the enemy cover and that's where the fight is won.  Pick the right tool for the job. 


So here are the rules...

I got a magic number in my head a little lower than asking price. , First one to it without haggling gets it. I dont want the hassle of back and forth. Dont lowball me. Serious buyers only.


 FTF   for cash  or FFL ok , you pay shipping and taxes.
Valid Drivers License required.  By contacting me you affirm you are not a felon.

The Mossberg 500 Pump Action Flyway Series Waterfowl is a pump-action hunting shotgun chambered in 12 gauge. The model 500 is a series of shotguns marketed as an inexpensive alternative for hunters, but the Flyway Series Waterfowl costs a little bit more than average at $485. What makes it different than the Waterfowl model is that it comes with different chokes. The Flyway uses ported chokes, so the gas pushing the pellets out will expel before the muzzle ultimately reducing the recoil. Otherwise it has a synthetic stock with a Real Tree finish. It has a vent rib barrel and fiber optic sights, which have bright colors that are easy to see. And, it has an ambidextrous safety. Mossberg recommends it for hunting waterfowl, of course.

I live in an apartment and have nowhere to work on her any more and can't imagine paying someone 500 dollars to do it, would rather take the loss. wouldn't hurt to do a new muffler too but not neccesary. This little girl will crawl you through just about anything in 4 low. I'm open to all offers including cash, trades on firearms, or would really love a smaller camper, 14' or so that I could haul with my jeep, get me the hell away from my ex while our lease runs out!!

This is a high-end, well built gun, and has some collector's appeal as well.  It's a Sabre Defence Massad Ayoob Signature Series Professional 15.  This 5.56 rifle is equipped with a 16"" vanadium barrel--same stuff Sabre uses(used) for making full auto M2 50BMG's, two stage match trigger, ergo grip, mid-length gas system, tritium night sights on the gas block and on a removable carry handle (gun is flat top), bayonet lug, forward assist, ambidextrous safety, Sabre ""Gill Break"" (very effective), and 6 position collapsible stock.  This is serial number 13 of a limited run of these guns (I was told a couple of thousand).

I bought this gun brand-new from an Army Ranger who won it in a competition and couldn't see a use for a 16"" gun.  He kept the case and cleaning kit that came with these guns, but I am including a different case along with the 2 20 round mags and the 2 30 round mags that came with it.  I'll also throw in a pair of YHM elevated mounts and a cheapo (NCStar) 3-9 scope (with the gill break, it held zero just fine for me).

These were $2k new, and this one is in great shape.  It's nice and tight, I've only put a few hundred rounds through it, and it always functions flawlessly.  I'm looking for $1400 or best offer.  

I can ship to your ffl for $35, or I can do a local, hand-to-hand transaction as well.  Postal money order if shipped, or cash only.

Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most
trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an
armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of the great pump-gun legacy
through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable
shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. The exclusive
ArmorLokt  construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of
weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet
dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day. Its overmolded surface is built
to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that's barbed wire, gnarly
thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it's time for action, the
revolutionary SuperCell recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force
that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is the
softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is
manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.

The revolutionary new In-Line Inertia Driven® operating system, with superior reliability and lightning fast speed, is the simplest semi-auto shotgun operating system ever devised.
Advanced ergonomics assure fluid gun movement. Combine that with the ComforTech® Plus recoil reduction system, and Benelli puts in your hands the world’s softest-kicking shotgun. In recent lab tests, the competition had up to 72-percent more felt recoil than the Vinci. And, its modular design makes Vinci the easiest shotgun on the planet to assemble and disassemble. No wonder it’s named for Leonardo da Vinci, the great Italian Renaissance inventor, artist, and thinker who shattered the technological boundaries of his world. Let the revolution begin."

I have Zombie Green, Black, Woodland camo, Olive Drab, Coyote brown, OD Green, Tan, Desert camo, pink, red, blue, pink camo, and several more colors in stock.

The Universal nylon ends will fit almost any rifle. They even work good on tactical rifles like the AK, SKS or AR. The nylon will also not scratch your gun like the steel clips will. The ends are made of 1"" wide 4200lb tensile strength nylon. You could pull a truck with this stuff. I use the nylon instead of leather for the added strength and will not get brittle like leather over time. The nylon is held together with a black 1/4"" chicago screw. The black finish on the screws are highly scratch resistant, seems to be a black chrome finish. Made of new USA made Mil spec government approved 550 7 strand Paracord. There is a total of about 90 feet of paracord in this sling. In an emergency you can unravel the outer 45 feet of cord and still have a useful black sling. 

The USA made paracord is manufactured to Mil-C-5040H Type III standards. This paracord has seven removable inner strands. Each of the 7 strands of 100% nylon strands are made from two-ply yarns. This is certainly not the lower quality paracord that is made from bulk fibers. Each of these 7 strands are capable of holding 50 pounds. The outer cord is made from 32 strands which are braided together and can hold 200 pounds. Add it up (50x7 + 200) and the cord can hold 550 lbs, therefore it is truly 550 paracord. 

Paracord is like duck tape and has unlimited uses only limited by your imagination. The 7 inner strands can also be removed and used for things like fishing line, or sewing thread.

I usually sell them for $50, but they are now just $25. Shipping is free. I also take Pay-pal or can meet in Louisville or Shelbyville.

This is a Daisy Powerline 93, a 1980s vintage CO2 BB pistol LNIB. I bought it online from an antique dealer and from the look of it, someone got this as a gift and never fired it. Came in the original box with papers, holster, and a 3-pack of extra magazines. Holster and mags still in unopened packaging. I have testfired it at work a few times, running 2 or 3 cartridges through it. Runs great.

The Model 93 is not only more reliable and durable than the later ambi-safety bumper chrome version, but it looks better too. All black with simulated walnut grips and single safety lever. Hammer does not cock, and mags insert on top of gun behind the barrel. This pistol has a grip safety. Each mag holds 15 BBs. A single CO2 cartridge is good for over a dozen mags before there is a noticeable decrease in power. With a fresh cartridge, the first few mags will fire BBs through both sides of a soda can. Gun is accurate, quiet, and safe for indoor or city use (with reasonable precautions). Please note that this all black pistol looks exactly like a real gun and BBs will injure animals and break windows. Not a toy. ""You'll put an eye out with that thing."" etc.

THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT XMAS GIFT!!!! Christmas tree ornaments make great targets!

I am asking only $50 CASH (which is significantly less than I have into it). Comes with original box, holster, extra mags, over a thousand BBs, and 7 C02 canisters!

Will trade for .44 Special or .22 WRF (not WMR) ammo.

This is a pic of the actual gun. You will not find another like it."

I have a 2007 Suzuki GSX-R 600 for sale. 12,400 Miles

Its the most desirable color combination, Near mint Condition, Has a few, very very small blemishes here and there from normal use. She runs very strong never had any problems with her at all. Always garaged and stored properly, This bike runs amazing, looks amazing and handles amazing.

Take a ride on the GSX-R600 and you'll quickly become aware of a highly developed sporting tool. On a particular solo run on the Gixxer, the man/machine interface was direct and inspirational, not wanting of a dollop more power or a scintilla of a quicker flick. Its available power is plentiful and the gearbox and slipper clutch works seamlessly at the command of your fingers and toes. The twisty road ahead is consumed to the accompaniment of a beautiful scream from the injected Four. It's difficult to imagine an experience much better.

TxT Joe @ REDACTED

The Saiga-12 self-loading smooth bored shotgun is intended for professional and sport hunting of small-and medium-size game under any climatic conditions.

This shotgun is built on the famous AK-47 action that has been proven by years of very reliable combat action!

The shotgun comes with 12-ga. smooth bored barrel and the chamber which accepts the ammo equipped with shot or slugs including ""Magnum"" cartridges with
70mm (2-3/4"") and 76 mm (3"") cartridge case.

The shotgun is used to deliver single shots. It is reloaded automatically due to the energy of powder combustion gases bled from the barrel bore through the barrel port. The shotgun may be equipped with a sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation, which makes zeroing and firing at moving targets more convenient. The gas motive unit is adjustable to match the parameters of internal ballistics inherent to the standard cartridges and ""Magnum"" cartridges, as well. For the purpose of diversifying operational capabilities the shotgun may be equipped with muzzle adapters of different chokes, including the muzzle adapter ""Paradox"". (IZHMASH)
