The barrel original to the gun is a 30 inch vent rib full choke.  I believe the barrel code dates it to 1974.  The second barrel is a 28 inch modified choke vent rib barrel that I believe dates to 1974.  Both barrels read ""2&3/4 inch or shorter shells"" on the side.  The trigger group on this gun features that wonderful chrome lifter and the stock features the sought after pressed checkering pattern that is still nice and sharp. I bought the gun used in 1998.  At the time less than a box of shells had been run through the gun.  Since I have owned it  I have used it a few times for informal clay pidgin shooting and that was about it.  500 rounds at best.  I am sure if you look long enough at this gun you will find a nick, ding, scuff, some where but you would have to look long and hard.   MSRP on a new Wingmaster is $820 witch is about what you would pay out the door retail with tax.  Yes a new Wingmaster will handle 3 inch shells and come with screw in chokes.  They do not however offer a 30 inch barrel at this time and just do not ""make the like they used to"".  I delete postings as soon as deals are completed so if you are reading this then the item is still available.  I am located right on lake Erie half way between Toledo and Cleveland in Vermilion Ohio and am willing to meet someone at a reasonable distance from my house.  $650 or best offer.  I am looking to sell at this time, not really interested a trade unless it is really in my favor and I will be able to flip it quickly.   I will need to insure that you have an Ohio driver's license at the time of sale otherwise the gun will need to be transferred threw a FFL.   Please do not bother me with scams, pranks, or low ball offers.  Phone calls preferred.  REDACTED."

Sharp as Saladin’s legendary blade, the sleek, classically curved Cold Steel® Scimitar® places the power of the sword in your pocket.
Our craftsmen have captured the timeless quality of superior cutlery and united it with the finest in modern materials. The result is a dazzling, high impact folding linerlock® like no other knife available.
The Scimitar® blade is hollow ground stainless steel, honed to razor sharpness and features the famous curve of its ancient namesake. Painstakingly designed to facilitate the draw cut, the most effective cutting stroke known to man, the blade also features a needle sharp point which pierces at the slightest touch.

Superior engineering combines traditional appeal with the latest Western technology in the contoured Zytel® and steel frame handle designed exclusively by Lynn Thompson for the Cold Steel® Scimitar.® The pistol grip handle facilitates all types of forward grips, including the saber, quarter saber and hammer grips. Its sleek curves, finger grooves and checkering settle naturally and securely into the hand, maximizing the user’s ability to control both the edge and the point. Reverse or palm reinforced grips are mastered with ease, making the pistol grip shape of the Cold Steel® Scimitar® handle one of the most versatile and user-friendly ever devised. A hard-hitting ball shaped pommel contributes to the Scimitar’s® rock steady grip and versatility. The pommel can be used as a striking tool to deliver less than lethal blows to nerve centers and soft targets. It can also serve as a secondary grasping point, allowing the user to extend his reach by as much as three inches.

Lock strength is critical in a high performance knife, and the Scimitar® is head and shoulders above the rest. We have equipped the Scimitar® with a state-of-the-art titanium linerlock® for maximum strength and durability. The strength of titanium is peerless in the cutlery industry, and tests on this mechanism resulted in it holding 100 pounds without collapsing, far exceeding the load-bearing ability of our competitors.

A pocket clip makes it a snap to carry and access quick as a flash. Feel the extraordinary power of history’s most famous sword design in a folding knife of unequaled versatility- and put it in your pocket - with Cold Steel's Scimitar®."

Its well maintained and still fires smoothly. No jamming or misfiring. Its a great conversation piece! I don't see these at gun shows very often at all. I always love to go and look. It seems to me the price of everything with a 30 round clips have gone up but these were always pricy. The ""gangsters"" who used guns like these had such class and style unlike the thugs we have today. I want to see this gun go to a good home. So I am asking 1250 or best offer. If i have to throw in ammo to see it go to a responsible owner i will do it and if it helps the sell.  I may consider some trades or trades with cash. This is the Volunteer version that is unmodified and original. The price is a starting point and we can negotiate deal. And will accept the custom fab drum mags.

Troy DOA diamond rear folding sight, MI HK-style front flip-up sight (this is an awesome combo if you've never tried it, super-quick target acquisition) It has the Magpul enhanced trigger guard too.

It comes as pictured except for the muzzle break, the laser on the side and eotech are extra. it will come with either an A2 flash hider for advertised price or add a PWS Triad that I have handy for $45.  So it includes the Hogue grip, FDE Windowed PMAG pictured.  Comes with a single point bungee sling (not pictured) and I-Kick_Hippies sling point end plate, also quad rail with rail covers.

A great setup.  Fires very smoothly since it has the Spikes ST-T2 heavy buffer which happens to be my favorite buffer.   I really hate to sell this but taxes and finding out we're pregnant last month has forced some decisions upon me.

Practically new, has less than 100 rounds fired through it and performed flawlessly.
This is perfectly legal with the short barrel as long as it doesn't have a stock or front grip on it.  It is easy to add stock and longer barrel if you want to convert to a rifle (but you can't legally go back to a pistol at that point) and I'd do it for free if you wish.  

Eotech is an add'l $350, and laser/light thing on the side rail IS NOT INCLUDED.

I have for sale a nice Taurus PT99 that was made (according to the Taurus website) in 1990.  It looks like it hasn't been shot more than a few times, and kept in a safe the rest of the time.  It is in 95% or better, retaining all bluing that I can see.  I shot it a few times, and it fires great with no jamming or any issues.  I believe the one mag in included holds 15.  It comes with a lockable hard-side box.  I'm told that Taurus purchased the original tooling from Beretta to manufacture these.  I would buy that, because the fit and finish of  this gun exceeds some Italian Berettas that I have seen.

I purchased this in a package of a few guns because I had a buddy that wanted it.  He changed his mind, and I don't really need it, so it's for sale/trade.  I would be interested in .44 special .44 Mag or .45acp revolvers for a trade, or anything interesting or unique.  I can add cash for the right trade.  Sorry, not interested in  10/22's, plastic (sorry, composite!) guns, coins, non-firearm collectibles, or ammo.

I'll need to see ID and preferred CWP, although no paperwork will be turned in.

Thanks for looking.  Please feel free to ask any questions."

NOTE: My personal opinion, this is the BEST handgun I've ever owned...and I've owned and shot ALOT of guns. I guess that's why I have 3 Five seveN's!!! And while the following factoid has no bearing on my love for this pistol, the Five seveN is also the firearm carried by the U.S. Secret Service. I'm only selling one of them so I can buy a different color Five seveN as I have 3 in FDE color. While physically it's a large gun (about the size of a Glock 21), it weighs practically nothing. Even fully loaded with 21 rounds it is so light weight you will sometimes forget that you're even carrying it. The recoil is almost nonexistent but the damage that the 5.7 round can do with a muzzle velocity of 2600 fps using some of the more potent ammo out there like the T6 trident, S4M, or SS190 armor piercing rounds, is devastating. A small, light, screaming fast bullet that will make a small entry hole, but create an apple-sized cavity internally is what makes this particular gun my favorite firearm to carry hands down.

I am the original owner from 2000.  It has been fired at the range, and would rate it's condition at 90-95% (with some scuffs from being in the gun locker for 13 years) still have original Colt box and bag it came in.   This is the throw back model that is from my generation looking more like the AR from the VietNam era - but if you know ARs, you know that you can quickly remove the carry handle and with simple tools, replace the stock and foregrip if that is your passion.

I have been listening to offers for the last two weeks, only a few serious folks and then some 'clown' flagged as a scam - so it is a re-listing today Feb 3rd.  I am not trying to get $3000 for it like some scam artists on line, but am looking for a 'realistic' cash offer.   So please don't tell me that you can get it for $1,000 today - if you really can, you should buy 3!!

If you are from out of state, will need to have your FFL to ship to, will expect you to split shipping and insurance fee's.  In state, will expect you to travel my way and have valid IL FOID and DL and sign bill of sale observing 24 hour IL wait law.

Serious offers, please feel free to text or call 217 three seven seven 38 one 9.   Can send pictures.

Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 15 boxes available. Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!
