Stock # MSH240411SP. Serial # 13xx. One of HUNDREDS of Collectible, Antique, Military, Sporting and Tactical Firearms for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings), this is a magnificent find for the Serious Colt Collector, a very rare Colt Camp Perry Pistol. Made for the top-level target matches held at Camp Perry, Colt only produced 2500 of these pistols between the years 1920-1941. Chambered for .22LR, the pistol is built on a Colt Officers Model Match frame, but it is a single shot pistol, the entire “cylinder” swings out for loading. The pistol has a 10 ” barrel with an adjustable rear sight, and the front sight is adjustable as well. As attractive as it is rare, the pistol is finished in Colt’s finest polished Commercial blue, and it has factory wooden checkered grips with silver-colored Colt Medallions. The pistol has a few very light service marks on the receiver and there is a very minute area of freckling on the right side of the receiver. There is also a tiny, but noticeable ding on the butt of the grips, this notwithstanding, these are very minor and overall condition of this beautiful pistol is 95%. The pistol has a shiny bore with strong rifling, and trigger pull is very smooth. This is a Museum-Grade Colt that will be a centerpiece of a fine collection.

Over the years, it has been moved around a bit, so there are some minor marks, and scratches etc. Also, I do NOT have the installation instructions anymore. Installation is fairly straightforward, and as with any fiberglass body kit, there is fiberglass work that is needed to get it to look flawless.
This kit uses OEM Mercedes Benz Lights, grill & misc. trim pieces that give it an even more realistic look.

Why pay $75 a month to store your items in a mini storage that you have to drive to? For that price - this building will pay for itself in 8 months!

I have a Cedar Ridge building that is approximately 8 foot by 12 foot with barn doors on front. The structure and roof look good, however the bottom of the siding could use repaired or replaced. This building sells for $1700 new and I have discounted it significantly to make sure it is still a good deal for a buyer even after repairs.

It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

This current revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which provides even smoother loading with military stripper clips, and the Impact/Dust Cover can now be snapped onto the floorplate when not in use to prevent possible loss.

I had it on my Yugo M59/66A1 but later decided to keep the rifle in original military configuration to hold value. The site wants 68 bucks+shipping for it. I'm only asking $50 shipped. It does have a little wear on the finish but that just happens with anodized aluminum. If you put a scope on this rail it will take off some of the finish. It's a solid mount though and I had a Bushnell long eye relief scope on it that worked great. Preferably I think one would use a red dot on it but it should be a low mounted red dot with an integral weaver mount. An Aimpoint micro would be great or if you wanted to settle for the 1,000 hour battery life go with a Primary Arms MD-06. They're a solid little piece of equipment for the price and not everyone needs to have their optic on for 5 years straight or take it on an amphibious reconnaissance mission. If you have a chinese SKS that isn't worth keeping in its original configuration this mount and an MD-06 is a great combination to make your SKS a little more high speed and a better shooter on the cheap."

One thing to consider for anyone looking at a gun on here, we don't know what the pres. is gonna announce on Tues. My thoughts are a ban on high cap mags initially. But they have been talking alot about closing the gun show loophole, which applies to this website. It would eliminate person to person gun transfers. Something to think about!!

IF YOU SEE THIS AD IT IS STILL FOR SALE


Having a primary optic with the capability to be quickly attached and detached from a weapon system, while still maintaining ""on target"" repeatability, provides a degree of tactical flexibility highly valued in urban combat.
The rugged EOTech holographic sights are excellent choices for a ""red dot"" optic. 
However up until now, adding some type of quick detach mechanism meant mounting the sight on some other mounting platform that raised the EOTech at least another 1/2"" above the bore. 
Besides adversely affecting cheek weld, mounting the EOTech in this manner no longer allowed the shooter to co-witness the EOTech sight with the back up iron sights of the weapon system
It is important to note that because the patented Accucam QD Mounting System replaces the existing mounting screw and thumbnut system of the EOTech, it does not add any height to the optic
The EOTech Accucam QD Mounting System from GG&G is the only QD Lever System available today that does not add height to the EOTech.
This patented, unique and innovative quick detach system retrofits directly to the body of the EOTech.
The GG&G EOTech Accucam QD Locking Lever System replaces the EOTech socket head screw or thumbnut attachment method. 
No other modifications are required. 
The Accucam system installs in approximately ten minutes.
The only tools required are a 7/64"" allen wrench and a torx head wrench, which are both included in the kit.
This system fits new and existing EOTech sights that have the protective shroud and only adds three ounces.
It is fully adjustable to fit Weaver and MIL-STD-1913 dovetails, even those that are worn or out of spec. 

Not recommended for .50 BMG or lightweight machine guns

Once installed on the EOTech the sight can be quickly installed on a dovetail rail in seconds by rotating the Accucam Cam Lever to the locked position. It can then be quickly removed by rotating the Accucam Cam Lever to the unlocked position. 
In tests, the EOTech Accucam QD Mounting System has shown to be repeatable to less than 1/2 MOA. The unique finger loop design is easily operated, even with a gloved hand and the rounded design is ergonomic and virtually snag-proof
Manufactured from solid billet 4140 steel and manganese phosphated matte black to mil spec, the GG&G Accucam QD Locking Lever System provides a solid, rugged quick detach system for your EOTech. 

GG&G's EOTech Accucam QD Mount is a preferred upgrade for anyone with an EOTech 511, 512, 551 or 552 scope. 

Like all GG&G accessories, the Accucam QD Mount is made in the USA in Tucson, Arizona

It has a Colt brand red-dot (co-witnesses well with the fixed irons), adjustable stock, and a welded-on flash hider, a quad-rail (Knights Armament)with the rail covers on all 4 sides. It has a bayonet lug and sling loop. This belonged to my dad, and after his passing it was left to me. He didn't shoot it much. I've put about 300 rounds through it myself, i think he ran a few mags through but i can't remember that far back.

What i can tell by taking it apart:
M-16 guts, full-auto BCG. It looks like there was some millwork done to the lower behind the trigger control group, and after some research it looks like my dad milled out the Colt auto-sear block for whatever reason (he didn't like being told he couldn't do something, and had plans for buying a RDIAS once he had the cash).

What i'm asking:
Most NIB Colts are going for 2250 right now...  This one is gently used and has been kept nice and clean in a safe, and has many things those stock rifles don't.  Price adjusted accordingly.

These are sold out everywhere and are getting harder and harder to find. Better get this one before Obama uses his Executive Order. If you have any questions please ask. Once again this is a FACTORY NEW RIFLE. Asking 2999 or best offer. Any reasonable offer will be considered. I will add the stripped upper receiver for asking price."

This upper was built by Alexander Arms. I am the original owner and have put about 100 rounds through it, meaning I have saved you the time and ammunition of breaking in a new upper. This upper is a tack driver with the right ammunition. The barrel is threaded so that a flash suppressor, muzzle break, or noise suppressor can be attached. The recoil is not much more than a 5.56 AR but the round is significantly more powerful than the 5.56. Both Hornady and Wolf make ammunition for the Grendel. I am throwing in for free 200 rounds of Wolf ammo new in box about 50rds of fired 7.62x39 brass. 7.62x39 brass can be run through the Grendel sizing die and sized to fire in the Grendel (use generous amounts of lubricant).

Best case scenario for me would be to trade this gun for a handgun, but I'm very open to all cash or trade offers. If you're unfamiliar with this cartridge, do a little research on it and you'll find out that it is one of the flattest-shooting rounds anywhere (more so than a 223), and is still heavily used in Europe for both large game hunting (deer, moose,etc.) and in military applications. The gun was made by a reputable gun builder on the west side of Michigan for his wife years ago, so the quality is top notch. The gun holds 5 rounds, and the bolt action is very tight. It also has a manual thumb safety on the right side. The barrel is a Carl Gustav with a custom flash suppressor. Another great feature of this gun is the trigger- it is adjustable and currently set VERY light. The included scope is a 4-12x50mm with adjustable objective and a flip up cover. All in all, this gun is a true tack-driver and very fun to shoot. I have 8 rounds of Fusion soft tip rounds for it, as well as 4 boxes of empty casings for reloading. You can also have the hard case that it's currently in. Please feel free to email or txt me at REDACTED with questions or offers. Thanks for looking!"
