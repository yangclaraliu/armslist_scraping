If you don't know what a ""PISTON DRIVEN AR"" is....you need to do your homework.

REVIEWS BY ADVANCED WEAPONS:
First field test of the SR556- Sheridan, Wyoming. Ruger factory sponsored prairie dog hunt. We were privileged to attend the hunt, and an Impact employee was the first to take an animal with the SR556 rifle!

Function and reliability were 100%. The dog town we were shooting at had dogs out to 360 yards. All ranging was done using the new Ziess 8x binoculars with range and holdover function. Even with a low 10x scope, dogs were taken all the way out to 361 yards. Very impressive for any rifle, and even more so for a carbine!

We were shooting Hornady TAP ammo, 55g, loaded into the P-Mags that are included with each rifle. Effect on the targets was devastating. Multiple hits and complex gymnastics by the dogs were the norm.

All in all, our experience with the SR556 was beyond our expectations. The gas system gives the gun a softer recoil that a standard gas AR, and the chamber/bolt area was much cleaner that a gas AR. This SR556 is a keeper, and a really good value with all the good kit that is part of the base rifle.

We have sold literally hunderds of the Ruger SR556 rifles. They are incredibly reliable and several of our customers report that even after thousands of rounds (some without cleaning) they have not experienced a single malfunction! 

If you don't know what a ""PISTON DRIVEN AR"" is....you need to do your homework.
Piston AR's are more Reliable, Cleaner and Smoother Shooting!

Once you BUY/OWN a Lancer AWF Mag....you will throw away your PMAGS!

The L5AWM is the only HYBRID AR magazine available today, featuring the best characteristics of Polymer and Steel magazine designs. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.

The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few.

Do some homework and you will figure out this is the BEST MAG MADE!

The compensators are empty tubes that allow the gas to expand and cool, then to vent upwards through ports in the end of the tube. This reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise to keep you on target.  They are threaded 1/2x20.  There is a set screw on the rear bushing that lets you rotate the tube to position the vents upward.

The muzzle couplings allow you to use these threaded compensators without having threaded barrels.  The couplings fit over the end of the barrel with a slot for the front site.  Then, two split rings can be tightened up against the rear of the front site to lock the coupling in place and providing a 1/2x20 thread for accessories.
All parts are blued steel.  Ruger items shown in pictures are not included.  Couplings and compensators only.

I have three pairs I am willing to sell.  (1) A 5"" compensator with a coupling for a MarkII with a std 4.5"" bbl. (2) A 5"" compensator for a MarkII with a 10"" Bull Target bbl (round, slightly tapered, not flat). (3) A 6"" compensator with a coupling for a 10/22 std bbl and a flash suppressor.

Once you BUY/OWN a Lancer AWF Mag....you will throw away your PMAGS!

The L5AWM is the only HYBRID AR magazine available today, featuring the best characteristics of Polymer and Steel magazine designs. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.

The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few.

Do some homework and you will figure out this is the BEST MAG MADE!

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. 


The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

It is a 12 Guage O/U shotgun with 28"" Barrels and Fixed Chokes (full and mod). Gun is in great condition, it has been shot very little but nonetheless used. It stays locked in my safe when its not being used. ¾ down the barrels on the exterior, there are small light abrasions from fingerprints that were not wiped off years ago. There are a few small dings on the stock and fore grip that are consistent with normal handling. The lock lays slightly to the right as it should. With the Citori ""special steel"" barrels, this gun is safe to shoot steel shot even with the fixed chokes, however, none has been ran through it. The bores are bright and shiny.

This Citori model is stamped “J53” which should tell you what type it is but Browning failed to record this model during manufacturing. I’m not sure how many were stamped this way but there are a few blogs out there annotating the same misprint. This weapon opens, closes, ejects, and fires like a dream. I do not have the original box/papers but will include a case with it. Below of the specs:

Great magazine Holster made of durable polymer, they expand to work with 99% of all hi cap rifle mags and are available for free shipping and at a great deal!


Details:

The FastMag GEN.III accommodates most 5.56mm/.223 ammunition magazines. It reduces reloading cycle time for the operator and can be mounted in the up or down direction (operator’s preference). The system eliminates the need for traditional top closures, while providing a secure point of access.

The enhanced urethane tension strap is adjustable to meet the users preference for removal tension. The mounting slots on the front allow operators to ‘double-stack’ FastMags (FastMag™ GEN.III or FastMag™ Pistol) or attach nylon accessory pouches using MALICE® Clips, giving even more options for your kit setup.

ITW Ghillie-TEX Molded Magazine Pouch securely holds a single M-4 Magazine in place at most any angle without the need for retention covers or straps. The Fast Mag (Gen 3) comes in two versions:

Belt Mount: Does not have the top stabilizer wings and comes with a sliding belt adapter on the rear mounting straps. Should be used as the top pouch when the FAST MAGs pouches will be stacked. Can still be used on MOLLE platforms where there is no space for the top wings to be inserted.
Vest/MOLLE Mount: Top stabilizer wings slip under the PALS webbing row above the pouch for added stability in vest or platform mounted roles. Should be used as the base unit when two FAST MAG pouches are stacked.
Holds M4 Carbine magazines including HK mags and P-Mags
Reduces reload cycle time
Mount up or down (based on user preference)
Mounts to any standard duty belt or can be used to double stack the fast mags.
High-impact resistant polymer case w/ anti- fragmentation (reduces secondary shrapnel)
Slight twist draws mag out easily for quick reload
M-4 mag stays secure without pouch flap, hooks, cover, or lid
Retention strap provides adjustable friction and can be removed for minimum friction"

This gun was not used on more than a couple dozen occassions over its nearly 50 year life. Not a spec of rust anywhere, bluing is nearly perfect. 

It's been kept oiled and sitting on a gunrack. This gun predates the Gun Control Act of 1968 and never had a serial number. I've never weighed this gun, but it is very light---feels like under six pounds. 20 gauge pump action shotgun. This is a one family gun since new---I used it a few times myself in the mid 1970's.

This is a very nice gun for the money, and you will find nothing cleaner anywhere. If you saw this side-by-side with what's being sold new---the stripped down Remington 870's and the Walmart Mossberg 500's that sell for 250-300 bucks----you would laugh out loud.

The ""bluing"" on this one is really blue.

Not interested in trades, thanks anyway and I don't negotiate price via e-mail. Please come and look at the gun before you make an offer.

Buyer must have an Indiana driver's license, be 18+ years old, sane and sober.

TulAmmo Brass Maxx .223 Rem 55gr FMJ. 50 rounds per box. These are BRAND NEW to the market. They are loaded loaded by Fiocchi using Fiocchi brass (and I would assume other components as well) and are branded for Tula (box is marked ""Made in Italy""). Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 15 boxes available. Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. 2 box minimum on orders I have to ship."

These are BRAND NEW to the market. They are loaded loaded by Fiocchi using Fiocchi brass (and I would assume other components as well) and are branded for Tula (box is marked ""Made in Italy""). Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 15 boxes available. Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

Purchased new less than a year ago. The fore-end fully shrouds the barrel, ends 1/8"" from end of muzzle attachment which is a blast directed flash suppressor designed for short barreled rifles (significant fireball). 
Because of it's shrouded free-float design it is extremely suited for QCB, smacking doorways, being thrown down, taking direct hits and allows maneuverability in automobiles or tight spaces without fear of harming barrel/accuracy.

Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 15 boxes available. Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!
