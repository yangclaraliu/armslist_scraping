Might trade for the right gun.
The new GSG-5 .22 caliber semi-auto rifle from American Tactical Imports is an exact replica of H&K MP5 sub-machine gun aside from the caliber. Ergonomics and handling are identical to that of the MP5 with an overall length of 33.5” and a weight of 6.6 pounds which makes it an ideal training tool for Law Enforcement, Military personnel or civilians. 22 long rifle offers an immense savings over 9mm/40/45 caliber ammunition allowing extensive range time with the GSG-5 at a minimal cost to the user. Barrel length on the GSG-5 rifle is 16.25 inches including the faux suppressor which surpasses federal requirements making it legal to own by anyone. The GSG-5 utilizes 10 rd detachable box magazine that releases with an H&K style paddle magazine release. The charging handle on the GSG-5 is located on the left side of the receiver and is non-reciprocating just like the H&K MP5 series."

The Smith & Wesson Victory Model was born from a war time request by the U.S. Military to supplement their issued sidearms with quickly tooled up civilian handguns. During World War 2, the U.S. Military sent over 570,000 of these pistols to both British and British Commonwealth forces. The V serial number range did not begin until 24 April 1942. All previous guns, both 38 S&W (or British .38/200) and .38 Spl, were serial numbered in the K frame range up to 999,999 and do NOT have the V prefix serial number and are, therefore, NOT considered Victory models. As production neared one million, S&W considered adding an A prefix, as their SN numbering machine was only capable of stamping six digits. Someone suggested instead to make the prefix “V” for Victory, and thus this model was named the ""Victory Model.” (Later, the hammer block safety was introduced at V769,000 when the prefix became SV. The end of war Victory model was SV811119, after which the prefix became S and the serial numbers continued, but these were no longer Victory models.)

… Most Lend-Lease Victory Model revolvers were originally chambered for the .38 S&W (or British .38/200) and many of these were later rechambered to fire the more popular .38 Special ammunition. A lot of these were refurbished by Parker Hale, Ltd., or Cogswell & Harrison, - but not all of them, - which leads to various grades of quality in the rechamberings. One issue to be aware of is that rechambering of 38 S&W (or British .38/200) cylinders to .38 Special results in oversized chambers which allow cases to possibly bulge or split. This does not affect accuracy or performance, but it does prevent the brass from being reloaded for use again. (NOTE: This gun is NOT rated for +P ammo.) I took THIS revolver to the Range the other day, and shot a group of surplus M41 FMJ Ball ammo at 10 yards, and the group was low at 6 o'clock, but five shots made a single jagged hole that was smaller than a Quarter, - and I dropped one shot (my fault, not the guns)  I also shot shot some vintage .38 S&W with similar results. … Based upon it's accuracy, and since this gun is professionally stamped on the frame “CAL. .38 SPECIAL” it is my assumption that the rechambering of this pistol was done by a competent armory.

I also have a box of 50 rounds of Winchester LRN .38 S&W ammo for this gun that I will sell ""with"" the pistol for $35. if you're interested."

The kimber will come with brand new VZ gunner grips in battleship gray, original peanut grips, spare dawson tritium front sight .180 height also brand new, all the original packaging with the gun lock, instructions, original mag and etc. It will also come with two new boxes of PMC bronze fmj. The only mods on this gun are an ed brown hardcore extractor and leaf spring. Did I mention that this model DOES NOT have that infamous crap firing pin safety? The warrior is definitely NOT a series II.

This gun has seriously NEVER BEEN FIRED. If it had been fired, there would be marks on the firing pin and brass marks on the ejection port(which there isn't). There is a small(minuscule) bit of wear on the tip of the rail. That small wear came from an x300, everyone knows that x300s fit really tight on most guns (the kimber was a night stand gun). I did not fondle the gun or put any idiot marks on it, it was left in the safe after the mods.

I bought this gun for 1379.00 after tax (i have receipt for proof) so if you add the mods, grips and ammo I'm still losing out. This gun is rare to find new because they are literally sold out EVERYWHERE and even if you do find one online, you still have to pay for shipping and sales tax once it gets here plus ffl fees. Yes, WA state requires ffl's to charge ""sales tax or use tax"" now on out of state firearms. Also, THE PRICE IS FIRM, NO TRADES. I'm not going to ship the either, I only deal locally.

Instead of the standard forearm found on the carbine, the Ops has an RIS, or Rail Interface System, that provides tactical railing on four sides allowing for you to mount a variety of available accessories.

Additionally, the carry handle that's on the carbine is also replaced by a detachable rear sight making the M4 Ops an ideal optic-ready rimfire rifle.

Had this up for a very short time a month or so back. Have no idea where I'll be or what I'll be doing this summer so I need to free up as much cash as possible. That being said, I will not take less than I'm asking for this pistol as of now. They are over $600+ new without the nice grips.

This is an excellent quick handeling gun in a proven game stoping caliber. 45-70 will stop anything in North America quickly and humanly and is a widely available caliber. The Porting makes this rifle's recoil comparable to a 12 ga shotgun even with the 405 gr bullets. The Marlins are one of the few rifles with a strong enough action to shoot Buffalo Bore ammunition.

Manufactured in 1899, this is a beautiful Model 1896 Swedish Mauser manufactured by Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori. This Pre-WWI rifle is an excellent example of the finely machined weaponry of the time and shows battle usage. There are several things that make this firearm very special.

It has matching numbers throughout, including the buttplate, magazine door, barrel ring, bayonet mount, bolt release, bolt, bolt knob, safety and receiver. The serial number is o.g. 12810 and makes this one of the earliest ones built, about mid-year in 1899.

This is an older import and does not have any stamping on the barrel showing the importer. Most of the guns you find these days have this stamping, and in my opinion detract from the value.

It has the original stock medallion (showing bore condition and size), original rings and cleaning rod. Crown Cartouche stamping is prevalant throughout, including marks on the stock, bayonet mount, barrel ring, floorplate, rear sight and reciever.The threaded muzzel is in fine shape and the adjustable front blade sight is present. It has ""0"" stamped on the mount and blade, presumably a sighters inspection stamping.

The Micro-Adjustable rear sight is a rare option and this one is perfect. It is not bent, rusted or worn out, and shows original bluing on the spring.

Condition is very good for it’s 113 year age with all metal surfaces showing a nice patina and the wood having a lot of usage marks. Fit between the metal and wood is superb, indicating the stock has never been refinished. The bore is bright and shiny with deep rifiling present. After removing the cosmoline in 1980, I fired this weapon a total of 4 rounds, and it function flawlessly. It has been either hanging above my door, or in my closet ever since.

All in all, this fine piece of military history is an unmarked and unmolested perfect example of turn of the century Northern European craftmanship.

It use to have a side mounted scope mount, and a shell deflector, which you can see evidence of, by the 2 extra screws in the side of the receiver and 1 on top. It is missing the rear sight assy, and the stock has a piece cut out of it to accomodate the side mount. This would be a great rifle to put back to orig, or to fully sporterize. Either way is a cheap option. The gun cycles and shoots good. The bore and insides are clean. The #'s match on the barrel and receiver. The bolt # is different. Not sure if wood is orig. It comes with a nice Buschnell scope w/rings, and a universal style mount, just needs mounted. It's actually in my name, so I know it's clean.

If you're worried about the cost of GAP ammo, email me, it's just a matter of knowing where to buy it, it's the same price as ACP, you just get the benefit of the slim grip, less muzzle flash and softer recoil!

The BTA's were the compact version (for concealed carry, etc.)  The current Tanfoglio importer is EAA.  The EAA version of this gun is called the Witness Compact.  There are some differences, primarily in the way of a full beavertail.  Otherwise very little has changed with them other than the importer.  It is also similar (same frame) as the Baby Eagle pistols.

It is a very solid & accurate gun and is in good shape.  It deviates from the original CZ-75's with the decocker (Tanfoglio was the first to do this on the browning hi-power platform).  

I've put roughly 300 rounds through it, of all kinds of different ammo.  It seems to handle russian steel-cased stuff no problem other than a few light strikes on TulAmmo particularly (shitty ammo, not the gun's fault), but no FTF's or FTE's.  It handled Blazer & Blazer Brass, RWS (Geco), & Federal FMJ's just fine.  It was unfired as far as I could tell when I bought it half a year ago. 

Comes with one 13 round magazine and a padded range case (holds 4 spare mags, a box or two of ammo, & the gun).

**UPDATE**

Due to people jerking me around, I'm going to be more specific.  If you are going to expect me to lower the price because you are hours away and will expend gas money to meet up or purchase this firearm, don't contact me.  If you aren't interested, don't tell me you are, make offers, and then just disappear off the face of the planet, or keep lowering the price until I'm pretty much giving it away.  Also, I don't appreciate the condescending crap where you chuckleheads are acting like you are doing me a favor.  Go into a gun store and see how far such a flippant attitude will get you.  It scares me that some of the people I've been corresponding with own or are attempting to own firearms.  The level of stupidity I've encountered is destroying my faith in humanity.  I'm willing to haggle price-wise, just talk to me.  The worst is I can say no.  I'm open to all trades at this point as long as you aren't asking me to pay cash on top of a trade of equal or lesser value.  **End Rant**"

I ordered it for my girlfriend and she ended up liking a little Beretta .32 I had instead. (I have a FFL and order guns part-time for friends and family)  The reason I ordered it is because a friend wanted me to get him a S&W airweight 9 shot .22 for his wife and I saw how it ended up near $700, so I got this one for almost half the price and it is almost identical in every way.

This pistol has a 2"" barrel and even adjustable sights.  This gun would be a great one for hiking or concealed carry due to the Ultra-Lite alloy construction and 9 shot capacity.  This one will have virtually no recoil due to the .22 caliber and would be a cheap gun to target practice with or a great one to show women and kids how to shoot or for anybody to use as their concealed carry gun.

I have several more pistols that I am now selling to put some cash back in my pocket.  I'll include a picture of those too.

Walther USA ®

The greatest addition to any Walther P22, the quick-release P22 Laser Sight from Walther USA is simply amazing.

Projecting a .50 inch dot out to a range of 50 meters, the Walther P22 Laser Sight can help greatly when training or in a quick-response self defense situation; sometimes one look at a targeting laser is more than enough to scare away any attacker. Rugged and durable construction to provide years of quality service.

The gun has been fired very little and has been cleaned thoroughly each time it was fired. The gun was NEVER holstered, so no worries of holster wear.

The Gun will come with: (I will not break up.)

-One factory 8 round magazine with the Kimber trademark on the bottom.
-Original case, paperwork, lock, etc.
-NEVER USED holster and two magazine holster (Worth well over $100)
-Three 15 round magazines.

The gun WILL NOT come with the Pewter US Army grips. Those were a gift from my wife on Valentine's Day and I promised I would never part with them.

Anyways, I'm looking to sell or trade this for other handguns. I'm willing to do multiple handguns for the Kimber, the trade value will be set at $1,100.00. I know the Kimber is not a cheap 1911, so I expect to get quality in return.

The reason these bags are so inexpensive is that with the exception of the paded area where the handgun goes, they don't have any imbedded padding within the walls to make them rigid.
They are basically like very strong duffle bags with individual compartments and the look of a range bag but with padded sleeves for handguns.
The bag was used lightly and is still in good condition.
I'm selling it because I WAS a dealer at one time and this bag wound up being used as a demo (so to speak) and the range bag I am currently is massive and really expensive.

The reason these bags are so inexpensive is that with the exception of the paded area where the handgun goes, they don't have any imbedded padding within the walls to make them rigid.
They are basically like very strong duffle bags with individual compartments and the look of a range bag but with padded sleeves for handguns.
The bag was used lightly and is still in good condition.
I'm selling it because I WAS a dealer at one time and this bag wound up being used as a demo (so to speak) and the range bag I am currently is massive and really expensive.

Manufacturer's Description:
http://www.doubletriple.com/bigpics/zzzminisuper.htm
Fits most large frame autos
Padded side pockets.  Holds 2 weapons. Main compartments for shells, cleaning equipment, targets, etc.  Two durable zippers for easy access to main compartment.  Hard padded bottom, wrap around handles.  Handles wrap around entire bag.  Adjustable, padded shoulder sling.  Cordura Nylon.  Center divider for main compartment.  Room for extra clips in side pocket!
Dimensions:       
Bag - 8 x 9 x 11
Side Pockets - 7 x 2 x 1

I'M asking to buy one of these for 475.00. THe PLRs go new online for 420.00 but I'm willing to pay extra because I don't feel comfortable ordering a gun online. So ill buy one used for more than new prices. IF you have ammo that would be great for either gun. 

As far as an AK goes they are 450.00 at my local pawn shops. I want a used one with some ammo for 475 that has been dressed nice. Nice grips, mags, rails... Tapco future is okay or original side folder is fine. I'M not interested in cheap and or wooden stock AKs. 

I feel I'm being more than fair but if you want to play the stupid game where we negotiate prices so you don't want to sell your gun for 25.00 cheaper and I don't want to buy it at 25.00 more... I'll play the game but its truly a waste of time. I'm in auburn near the mall but I'm willing to meet anywhere. For Birmingham I can drive to sylacagua or so.. but we will work something out.

This is the rifle that the police uses for urban sniping.  It has a 20"" barrel and is chambered in .308 Winchester.  It only has about 150 rounds through it.  The rifle is only about a year old and has rarely been out of its case. No nicks, dings, scratches or anything. 

The scope is a Burris Laser Range finding scope.  Basically, once you are on target, you press a button and a ""Y"" appears for ""Yardage"".  Press the button again and it will tell you how many yards away your target is.  Pretty neat little piece.

PRICE: $1300 for the set.  The price of scope and rifle were around $850 each.  I do not plan to separate the rifle and scope as of yet.  I am also open to trades for assault rifles or possibly a carry pistol plus cash.
