This rifle was built by ud in 1873 and was chamber for the 450-3 1/4 straight case cartridge.  This cartridge was loaded 3 1/4  drams of #6 blsck powder with 400-500 grain lead bullett.

It's a flat black base under a sponged on coat of blue, then a coat of sponged on green over that. The black, blue and green are all visible, it was sort of an experiment as to what I could do with a gun. The barrel is 17 3/4"" (ish) long, and the threads are 3/4 by 16TPI. No, it's not a common thread but that thread was easier for me to get taps for the suppressor I made. Yes, the suppressor is legal, on an ATF Form 1, with the $200 tax stamp.
The reason I'm selling this is because I don't need two bolt guns. My other is a Rem 700 in .243, and the shooting I do is mostly 200 yds or under. The MAIN reason I'm keeping the 700 is because it was sold to me by a family member and I cant sell it for obvious reasons. The scope that comes with the Savage is just a ""remington"" package scope, nothing special, but it makes the gun a package deal that way. I had a Vortex Viper on it and moved the Viper to my .243. The little Leupold that was on my .243 is now just a backup for myself (its only a 9 power)...
This is NOT an accutrigger model.....the Accutrigger only has ONE adjustment...spring tension.
the trigger in this is adjustable on 3 levels, similar to the 700 trigger...creep, tension and shear(?)....send me a message, would like to talk, price is negotiable, I can meet just about anywhere in central ohio to make it easier"

My hands are too small to comfortably handle this pistol. Sorry for no pictures, camera is on the blink. This pistol is brand new with everything from the factory. 
The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns — yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun.

The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more.

One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces.

On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1.

During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!"

Description:

This complete “limited edition” set of 5 revolvers is the first set of 50 sets produced by S&W in 2005. Under special contract for the Ellett Brothers, 50 “limited edition” sets of 5, 250 revolvers were manufactured. Each set includes a lion, elephant, cape buffalo, leopard and rhino. Each African big game animal image is plated in 24k gold.

The revolvers in S&W 500 magnum are finished in mirror polished stainless steel and are custom engraved with ivory grips. The 8 3/8” barrel is ported with recoil compensator. A custom oak presentation case comes with each gun in addition to all original paperwork, certificate of authenticity, standard blue plastic S&W case, etc.

All 5 guns in this first “limited edition” set are unfired and in NIB condition. Only the pictured gun (lion, serial # ABG0006) has been carefully handled except for serial # verification. The serial #’s for the other 4 revolvers are ABG0106 (elephant), ABG0206 (cape buffalo), ABG0306 (leopard), and ABG0406 (rhino). Making this complete 5 gun “limited edition” set even more collectable and rare is that many of the 50 sets were separated and sold as individual revolvers.

Special Note: Serial # ABG0001 through ABG0005 were reserved for one 5 revolver set, the “Master Edition” and featured more elaborate engraving by S&W master engraver Wayne D’Angelo."

It is in perfect condition and has been well-maintained and cleaned.  All serial numbers match.

The gun comes with 2 magazines that hold 8 rounds each. The finish is a little worn in some spots, but judging by the age of the gun it isn't that bad. Awesome price for a really basic 9mm. Makes for a great EDC gun and it has been mine for a while now. 
All this gun needs is a little TLC and it would really shine. Don't have the time or need for it tho so its yours for a meager $200. 
I also have 180 Rounds of old Milsurp 8mm Mauser ammo I am looking to sell. Just some old ammo my grandfather had stored in his warehouse for a while that is no longer needed. Looking to sell the ammo for about $120. 
Also willing to put the gun towards a trade for a revolver (.38 special or .357 but willing to hear other offers).

I bought this gun in May 2011. It has 1,000 flawlessly-maintained rounds through it. It is a great shooter and the sights are dialed in! It likes all kinds of ammo and all kinds of magazines!

There are some other things in the package and they are part of the deal, no exceptions. Sorry, I don't own any other 1911s, so it all has to go. I will not split them up. 

1. SR1911 w/ factory box, factory 7-rd magazine, factory 8-rd magazine and factory nylon zip case (not shown)
2. Extra mags inlcude (shown in picture): 1 Wilson Combat 47D 8-rounder, 3 Wilson Combat ETM 8-rounders, 1 Kimber Pro-tac 8-rounder, 1 Promag 10-rounder, 1 Promag 8-rounder
3. Shown on the gun are black Alumagrips. These come on the gun. They are CNC-machined black aluminum grips with nice checkering and feel. The factory brown wood grips also come with it, obviously. 
4. Safariland 6280 retention holster (this is a law-enforcement holster meant for a duty belt). Very high quality. 
5. Bianchi 2-mag pouch (this can mount horizontal or vertical and is also meant for a duty belt). Very high quality. 

I paid $750 out the door for the gun. I paid about $200 for all the magazines. I paid $60 for the grips. I paid $90 for the holster. And I paid $35 for the 2-mag pouch. 

That is $1135 that I paid for everything and I am asking $825. As you can imagine, my price is firm. People are selling these SR1911s for outrageous prices, for just the gun. 

I will not ship or deliver. You must come to me, or meet me in Milwaukee. Low-ball offers will be ignored.

I will require you sign a bill of sale and provide photo ID to verify that you are able to legally own a firearm. No exceptions."

Moon/Sun Roof, rear wiper, AMFMCD, power everything, inflatable seats, power seats. Still work fine, driver seat is a little worn, passengers seats are all nice. Needs oil change soon. I always service it before it's due. Just had the tranny worked on two years ago. Should be good to go for a while. I don't drive this thing like a truck, very mild, and close driving. I live 10 blocks from work, and don't travel much. Only thing issue is cosmetically the paint on the hood. Some friends welcomed me with paintballs as i entered one day. The Paintball stuff ate away some of the paint. I will post pictures this evening. Other than that, car starts right up, tires are pretty good still, and it's ready for summer.

Model: 1894 Saddle Ring Carbine

Year of Manufacture: 1897

Caliber: .30wcf

Barrel: 20"" Nickel Steel

Finish: Blued worn down to a nice silver with strong bluing still in protected areas. Firebluing on the loading gate is still visible.

Bore: is in outstanding condition. An easy 8-9 out of 10.

Sights: 
Rear: Earliest style flip up ladder sight(One just like mine, but in far worse condition just sold on eBay for $182.49 for the sight alone!) 
Front: Blade bead with ivory bead insert

Wood: Forend is in good condition overall. Stock has some shrinkage and someone put a recoil pad on it before I got it.

Metal: overall the metal is in really good shape with no real pitting or major handling marks aside from:
The saddle ring stud broke off. This is an easy fix. $18 in parts and $20 in labor.
The upper tang has a very old repair on it. This does not affect the function at all. 

Overall this is a beauty of an old Winchester levergun and an addition to anyone's collection.

Up for sale is my Bushmaster AR-15 A1 Series. This rifle is chambered in .223 and 5.56 NATO, and comes with an adjustable stock, 5 magazines,a fore grip, a hard case (bushmaster, not pictured) and a sling. I also have a good amount and variety of ammunition (steel and brass .223 and 5.56 penetrators). I have only put about 200-300 rounds through it, and it's in great shape. I have decided to sell this rifle for a couple of reasons:


1: I don't get out to the rifle range enough to have this rifle.

2: I need the money to go toward the purchase of a new car. I am enlisting into the United States Air Force and my car is not reliable transportation (94 Camry with 290,000 miles on it). 

The original cost for the rifle, magazines, and foregrip would total $850. I recognize that this rifle is a year old but it has not been shot very much at all and has spent most of that year in a case. Again I am open to all offers, DO NOT hesitate to put one out there! Please contact me if you have any questions or are looking for a particular type of picture.

I thought I would trade it for another pistol to take to the range, particularly a nice 22LR revolver so I could practice, or a different 9mm pistol. But feel free to make a cash or trade offer, I can include cash on my end if necessary. This revolver is very clean as you can see, not shot much at all, and the stainless steel looks great. The rubber grips make the full load 357 much easier on my hands, which is why I got it in the first place, and shooting those rounds are a lot of fun, a nice big bang and ball of fire. I found this pistol very accurate in single-action, especially for such a small barrel, I just have lousy double action trigger control. This revolver has a lifetime warranty from the manufacturer."

I will list them with individual prices, but would prefer to sell them all together.  All have been test fired and shoot good.  

First is a hard to find Carcano long rifle.  This rifle is chambered in 6.5 Carcano.  Bore is good with strong rifling.  Nice stock cartouches.  Also comes with original cleaning rod.  Most Carcanos found on the market are carbines and short rifles.  Long rifles are harder to find especially in this condition. This rifle does not have any import marks on it quite possibly making it a vet bringback.  Asking $225.00 for this long rifle.  

Second is a very nice M91 Carcano carbine.  This carbine is chambered in 6.5 Carcano as well.  It has a good bore.  Missing on screw in the front band.  Numbers don't match.  These carbines were built for cavalry and artillery soldiers.  Nice compact little carbine.  
I am asking $200.00 for this carbine

Next is a very nice commercially sportarized Santa Fe Enfield rifle.  It is chambered in .303 Brit and shoots great.  Has a very good bore and is very accurate.  It has a hard to find original Santa Fe 5 round magazine but will accept other milspec 10 round mags.  This is an original Santa Fe Enfield and was made from an original ENGLISH made Enfield.  
I am asking $175.00 for this rifle.

Last is a sportarized Enfield.  It is an Australian made Enfield with matching bolt.  This rifle has a good bore.  No mag and missing the buttplate.  This one is begging for a restoration!
I am asking $75.00 for this rifle.

Here is the steal of a  deal...if you want to purchase all of these rifle together, the asking price is $600.00. NO shipping! Face to face in Newark only, please!  Only trades considered are for military rifles and pistols.  Offers welcome, but I do not respond to lowball offers or disrespectful emails."
