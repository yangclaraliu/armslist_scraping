This is a custom rifle build on a Surgeon 591 short action.
Component list:
Action: Surgeon 591 SA (Integral 20MOA rail)
Barrel: Bartlien 22"" 5R 1:11 RH Twist
Stock: McMillan A3-5 w/ flushmount cups on bottom and left side for QD sling attachment, spacer system for adjustable LOP, and bipod stud
Bottom metal: Badger Ordnance M5 with (1) 5 round magazine
Trigger: Timney
Bipod: Harris
Rifle is aluminum pillar and glass bedded (Marine-Tex)
Tan Cerakote finish

I had a HorusVision Falcon scope mounted but sold it. Gun shoots like a dream, holding around .5MOA with all factory match ammo I have fired through it, and sub .5 to around .25MOA during load developement with reloaded ammo using 175gr SMK bullets. If cleaning condition are kept consistantly, cold bore effects are minimal.

Rifle has about 240 rounds through it, and has been properly cleaned and maintained after every range session.

It does have a few minor cosmetic blemishes where the finish has worn off on the side of the action and around the magazine well from normal use.

Compare this setup with the same components with a gun from GA Precision or Surgeon, and your looking at a 4200.00 rifle.

I'm asking 3000.00, but am open to offers and/or trades."

5"" semi drop in barrel, black oxide finish, matched barrel bushing.

New in plastic, and has never been installed in a pistol.
I ordered this for a replica build of the USMC's MEU(SOC) 45 or M45 pistol, but decided to scrap the project for something else. This is the exact barrel that the armorers at the USMCs precision weapons shop install on the custom built M45.

Barrel should drop right into any government sized 1911, but has the potential to require some minor fitting as slide tolerances vary by manufacturer. This is th case with any high quality aftermarket barrel.

If you have been thinking about upgrading the barrel in your 1911, save yourself a few bucks and the 3-5 month wait to get one of these high quality barrels from the manufacturer.

These are made by the former owner of Bushmaster after he sold his company and regretted it he reopened in the same shop with the old employees all of which he rehired. Do some research, these are GREAT rifles!!! 

NO TRADES.

Metal is perfect and the stock is a beautiful color with very nice grain. Rifle is all original and I do still have the factory sights. It has Leupold mounts and rings and wears a Bushnell Banner 6-24X scope. This gun is a tack driver! Five shot groups with this rifle can be covered with a dime at 100 yards. I am looking to maybe trade for a good Remington 700 in a short action caliber for my wife for deer season this year. I would love to keep this rifle, but its just a little too heavy for the wife and doesnt really fit her that well.

These pistols are accurate and super reliable. Easily as reliable as a Glock 26.

The 3913 is the most commonly seen version, and is available in LS, NL, and TSW configurations. The 3914 is the black version most popular with LE, and many who have owned both have stated that the trigger on the 3914 is smoother and accuracy was better. The 908 was the economy version that was released a few years later and not up to the same standards. Thus, the 3914 is the best 9mm pistol S&W has ever made or ever will make. These early pistols have no lock and no MIM parts. You cannot find a better 9mm CCW pistol anywhere.

These pistols have an alloy frame which can withstand +P ammo. They weight only 24 oz. 8+1 capacity. DA/SA with ambi decocker. Shaved hammer is flush with the slide. Mine has had less than 150 rounds down the pipe and is in like new condition. Beautiful pistol.

The negatives? Very few. It is a 9 shot 9mm and you cannot get wood aftermarket grips for it. Those are the negatives. The only reason I am selling this is to fund another purchase, because while I intended this to be my CCW it never gets carried, and I want something bigger for my nightstand gun.

WWW.PCShooting.com

We have filled over 2-3 spots in our upcoming North Carolina CCH / CCW Concealed Pistol Training class Sunday December 9, 2012.

The course is instructed by seasoned firearms instructor, Roger Pettit.
Roger is fully licensed and fully insured (Lloyd's of London) and we hold the class on an actual gun range. He has a great sense of humor and has great stories being he's an ex-marine, bounty hunter, and has worked with multiple military contractors. The cost of the class is $85 a person OR $150 ($75 each) if you bring along a friend. This price is ALL INCLUSIVE meaning this price includes course work, red book, certificate, drinks and pizza for lunch, and Roger even supplies guns and ammo if you choose not to bring your own!!! No tricks or gimmicks here! If you don't have experience, no worries! Roger will get you up to pace during the class. If you've done any research on CCH you know $85 is CHEAP and alternatives NEVER include this much. The classes are small (10-20) and Roger has years of experience teaching them in multiple states. If interested let me know and check out the website info: www.PCShooting.com.

The next class is December 9th. Location is ~25 minutes outside Cary, NC down US-1 at LCWC.

Also with it is the much harder to find carbine conversion kit. It also comes in original box consisting of 16"" barrel and shoulder stock and paperwork along with a tasco red dot.  This is not a sbr requires no tax stamp and is 100% atf compliant. As long as at no time do you install the shoulder stock prior to longer barrel because then yes you would have a sbr and would require a permit. Enjoy inexpensive .22 shooting on both platforms pistol and rifle and it only takes a few minutes to swap back and fourth between the configurations. Now the looks of the Neos are for some and not so much for others I for one think it is a good looking pistol and the carbine is just awesome looking.  Before any lowballs start coming my way I want to make it clear I do not need to sell this I am not hurting for money I just like to buy sell and trade firearms and I do so every single week I am sure many of you have either read my post before or have met with me before yes I keep the ones Really like but I also like to see what else there is out there. This combination of items has a used value between 450-500. Lesser firearms are not below me I would take inexpensive firearms with cash or multiple items or even cash going your way if it intrigues me enough. The only things I am not interested in are shotguns and .25acp. With that said if you are interested and have something to offer please do so .. Thanks"

Comes with 1 mag, Hi-Pt Trigger Lock, and an additional Halo Sight. Polymer Frame, and Florescent colored sights.

All Hi-Point Firearms come with a Limited Lifetime Warranty. 

This is a nice cheap gun, with easy to use features. It's a striker fire pistol, so no hammer to snag, while carrying. 

This is a Gun with Only a Basic Safety, and should Not be Carried with a Round IN the Chamber. This can Cause an Unintentional Misfire, if Dropped, or Accidentally Struck.

""Not for those with Grip Issues, or Sensitive Hands"" This is not a light recoil cartridge.

It is also a perfect Self Defense Firearm for those on a Limited Budget. It can be a fun plinker too. Great as a practice Gun, being it saves the abuse on more expensive guns also.

WA ID, Background Check Required. CPL Speeds up the process, so I can run it, rather than the required waiting period.

I do offer a Senior Discount on All my Firearms, as I understand many are on a Tight Budget. Those with proof of Limited Budget, will be allowed to make payments prior to purchase, and pick up. 

Thanks for your Business."

The late Safari legend John ""Pondoro"" Taylor summed it up when asked about the .375 H&H.  “ 	Undoubtedly one of the deadliest weapons in existence. I've had five of these rifles—two doubles and three magazines—and have fired more than 5,000 rounds of .375 Magnum ammunition at game. One of them accounted for more than 100 elephant and some 411 buffalo, besides rhino, lions and lesser game. 	”  One heck of a proven cartridge.  This can be a very flexible round,load lighter bullets and reduce powder charge and you will have a long range medium game killer,with less bloodshot meat damage than .300 class mag cartridges.
