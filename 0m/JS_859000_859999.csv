Better Hearing - Better Protection - QUIETPRO

Communication clarity and full situational awareness is crucial in all stages of tactical deployment. High steady noise generated by vehicles and high impulse noise from weapons and explosions degrades and sometimes block communications. This noise also causes temporary and sometimes permanent damage to soldiers hearing.

QUIETPRO greatly improves the crucial stages of communication in noisy surroundings while protecting, but not overprotecting, the users from these complex and damaging noises. It ‘enhances’ soldiers hearing where and when needed, significantly improving their natural auditory senses. It is fully compatible with most communication equipment and all military ground vehicle and aviation ballistic helmets and CBRN protection gear.

164,http://www.armslist.com/posts/859164,For Sale:  DANGER - Please be very careful,"Everywhere, Ohio, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Wednesday, January 16, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"To anyone who believes it is a good idea to flag ads you think are priced too high (or conversely too low) and, even worse, try to enlist others to do the same.

You are embarking upon a very dangerous course of action believing you should be the arbiter of pricing.  That is the same type of behavior in which this administration engages.  If they don't like the way a market is working (e.g. the housing market) they then attempt to impose their views, values and beliefs upon the market and ""move"" pricing in the direction they think is ""fair""...and we see how well that worked out.  If they don't like the views, values or beliefs of those with whom they differ, they attack them and attempt to silence them...witness the ""gun ban/restriction"" nightmare we are potentially facing.  Your attempt to force pricing down (or up) or force people out of the market by flagging them is absolutely no different and will have a very negative impact on this site.  Do you also advocate going on Gunbroker and forbidding people to offer their firearms up for auction because their opening bid or reserve is too high...or would you try and forbid someone to bid higher than the price you think the gun is worth?  

Similarly, will you also flag someone who is offering their firearm or ammo at an extremely low price?  I imagine you would simply buy it.

I would respectfully suggest and ask that you just allow the ""free"" market to work.  ""Free"" meaning sellers have the right to ask any price they choose and buyers have the right to bid any price they choose irrespective of what anyone else might think of those prices.  I personally can't believe some of the prices that are asked by sellers but, similarly, I also have to smile at some of the prices that are bid by buyers.  However, if I think the price is too high, I simply don't buy...I might even sell if prices get really stupid.  Does that make me a thief?  Similarly, if I see a really low price, I will buy.  Does that also make me a thief?  

The reality is that if prices are ridiculously high and no one buys then ultimately the seller, assuming they truly want to sell, will necessarily lower the price until such time as a buyer thinks it is a ""fair"" price and buys.

On the other hand, if someone does buy, at ""whatever"" price, I struggle to see why that would bother anyone.  If you want to buy .223 at $2.00 or $20.00 per round, what concern of mine is that?  Clearly your view of prices would be radically different than mine but you might think they are going to tax ammunition out of existence such that you could never buy it again.  Even though we might disagree as to what is a good or ""fair"" price or what that ammo is ""worth"", it would be your right to buy it at that price (and the seller's right to sell it at that price) and absolutely no business or concern of mine.  I would suggest that any price that is agreed to between a willing buyer and willing seller, no matter how high, low or objectionable any of us may find it, is by definition ""fair"" and ""worth"" it.

Firearm and ammo prices are high for a reason.  If ammo was readily available people couldn't ask and get the prices they are getting.  The problem is that it is not readily available.  Have you been to Walmart or your local gun shop and seen their shelves?  They are pretty barren.  Prices on firearms are high because demand is going through the roof.  Whether we like it or not, it is a reality.  There are external forces (primarily the Obama administration) that are driving demand, and thus the prices, up.  The greatest cause of this is the administration's desire to further constrain the supply of firearms and ammunition.  The supply of firearms is relatively constant but the demand is going through the roof.  Thus prices have to go up.

I have been both a buyer and a seller on this site for several years.  I want to see what is available in the market (both on the sell side and the buy side)...at any price.  I would seriously hate to see the market dry up or the volume of offerings decrease because some people feel they should be able to determine what a gun or ammo someone else wants to buy or sell is ""worth""."

This is an AA Arms Pistol, model AP-9, manufactured from 1991 until 2001. It is very much like an Intratec Tec-9. It has larger sights and a grooved muzzle barrel instead of a threaded barrel. Barrel length is 5 inches, and each included magazine holds 32 rounds each. Magazines for these range from 5 rounds to 32 rounds capacity, they're out there, I just don't know exactly where. I got this in a trade deal a couple years ago. I thought I would shoot it more, but it's mostly just sat around. I think I have taken it out twice, since I have had it. I have put maybe 75rds through it. It has a very low serial number, for what it's worth and the guy I got it from said it was a low round count. I do know it doesn't like cheaper ammo. I had a few different types of ammo and it ran great with what Olin I had with me, but didn't like Winchester white box or CCI aluminum casing. I never took the time to find what it runs best with, and just used what I had with me. I am mostly interested in trades, but feel free to make an offer above $425, if you'd like to buy outright. If I don't find the right trade, best offer takes it.

Thanks for looking.

Colt carbines are the absolute benchmark for patrol and service rifles, with some of the tightest tolerances and best accuracy in the industry. These guns are some of the most durable, reliable and sought after AR rifles, and they are completely unavailable. DO NOT buy that bottom-shelf DPMS or parts-bin frankenstein gun for more money before considering the industry standard, factory built rifle.

Perfect in every way, less than 100 rounds fired. ZERO visible wear, no imperfections whatsoever. Comes with box, 2 30rd magazines and 100 rounds of ammo. Lots of additional magazines available for sale if you're interested.

Face to face deal, no paper, no waiting, no drama. You must be a CO resident and legal to possess firearms. No criminals or thugs please. Buy it face to face while you still can.

Well I have one to work out a deal with you.

I purchased a plum crazy complete lower before all of this crap of inflated pricing and gouging went on and originally purchased it to make a light weight build. I decided that I want to build a aged looking gun. Unfortunately my lower lacks the the physical characteristics of anodizing to do what I want to do with it because it's durable composite. So, if you have a lower with no parts and want a complete, or just the anodizing  looks like crap, then I'm interested!

My lower only had one mag go through it to test a trigger job (which pulls at 4.5lbs consistently) and I smoothed down the buffer tube to make it look warn. Otherwise it's out of the box condition.

I'm only looking to trade, not to sell the lower unless it's for a highly inflated price so I can purchase someone elses lower that's selling one for a highly inflated price."

Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

Vepr in 5.45x39 caliber features a look similar to an AK, with a thumbhole buttstock and walnut foregrip. The hammer forged, chrome lined barrel is 16” in length, and a scope rail is riveted to the side of the receiver for easy mounting of a side scope.

(Think beat up worn rifle from Afghanistan.)  I don't have the heart to hand age it to achieve that look so I'm putting it up for sale so I can buy a lesser quality AK to beat up on.

The good:
It's all matching.
Takes those evil, violent, hate mongering hi capacity magazines.
I'm it's only owner.
Bore is still immaculate....I clean my weapons well.
The Chicom Ak's have .5mm thicker receivers and blued finish.

The bad:
Like all Chinese rifles, the wood has a few dings in it.  Nothing bad, from falling over into my Mosin's and SKS's.  A couple slight scratches on the front site hood and receiver cover but nothing bad at all.

I'm only including the 5 round magazine that came with it in the box.  I'm keeping all my other magazines because I'm using the money from this to fund a build.  If you're military (with ID to prove it) we can work something out.

I'm also throwing in a PLA Chicom stock set as well.

For sale is a Sig Sauer P290 chambered in 9mm. It comes with two magazines, one 8 round extended mag and one 6 round standard mag, factory laser site, factory night sites, factory hard case and factory paddle holster.
