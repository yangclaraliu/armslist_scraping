This is a factory built rifle and not a kit or parts gun. It has a NcStar tactical 4 rail and the original handguards. I added a badger tactical charging latch. 


The NcStar 3-9x40 scope w/ external laser  pictured on the rifle is included, but I'll sell the rifle without it for $120 less.  Scope has lifetime warranty and box/manual is included.

The rifle comes with original papers, hard case, clip. It has had less than 200 rounds through it and religiously cleaned.

 I bought this whole setup new 2 months ago and is in excellent condition. Only reason I'm selling is to build a custom AR. I'm not really interested in trades unless you have a Auto Ordinance Tommy gun or M1A.

This is a FTF cash sale in Edmond/Guthrie areas. Sorry no shipping."

The gun does have the square back in case you wanted to switch out the stock and grip, but honestly the grip on it worked very nicely for me which is why I never changed it.
The gun comes with 3 magazines, 1 loose bag of ammo, the stock handgaurd, and a red dot (not pictured).
For sale, best offer takes it, please email me your best offer, the first reasonable offer to meet me will have this rifle.

18.5 inch barrel, can fire every round up to 3 1/2 inch, it's cycled everything I've ever fed it, even the cheap crap from Wal-Mart up to the high end stuff from Fiocchi.
Around 400 rounds through, makes a great truck gun, farm gun or home defense weapon.
Just don't have the time for it anymore, I have 2 other shotguns and we're moving to either Arizona or Boston in the summer, would like to take as little as possible.

Up or Down on trades if we hit value numbers with cash either way. 
I put the legit trade value of the gun at $950+ and if sold for cash I'd like to see $850 FIRM. The barrel is easily worth $300 alone being a Full size, Stainless and FLuted. The other small parts add up quckly as well.

I also have Three additional magazines that will come with it if purchased as a whole unit in a Case and pictured for a total of 4 Magazines. This is worth Roughly $75 By itself.

I would prefer cash, but Feel free to make legit offers as I am open to them. Please do not offer me a Pistol with a Used , Street Sale Value of $600 and expect me to trade, as I wont. I want something Equal in Used, Street Value as this is. I'm asking $950 in Trade Value, and will accept a bit less if paying with Cash as stated. SO a Gun worth $600 to sell on the street wont cut it for a trade. Also, Trading me 10 Guns worth $100 Each is not going to work as well. Guns plus cash on the difference is more than welcome though.
Cash is King.

No scope, but these guns came factory drilled for side mounts. Good gun, belonged to an uncle and was given to me when I turned 12. Haven't used it in a few years, and my new 7mm mag finally crowded it out of my gun safe. Lightweight, great 1st hunting rifle--especially considering a few nicks in the stock---not a gun you'd have to worry about getting dinged. Shoots great. Can meet anywhere in the Pittsburgh area.

I have $180 alone in just the ram and new hard drive so $100 for the whole pc is a heck of a deal.
