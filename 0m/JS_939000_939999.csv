It has:
3 .223 five round mags.
Scope rings.
A 3x9 scope(not an expensive one, but a good, sturdy one)
An interchangeable barrel in .222 Remington (what the .223 was based on. A sum up of it is it shoots a bit further, and flatter than the .223, but it doesn't tumble on impact.)
2 .222 five round mags.
Seven boxes of .222 ammo.
And a laser bore sight for .223.

It also fires milsurp 5.56 quite well, and prefers the 55gr rounds as opposed to heavier.

All you need for swapping the barrels is a vice and a wrench, and somewhere around 15 minutes work to realign. Not hard, but not an on the fly thing.

A great, accurate, versatile rifle.
Has a few scratches from hunting, but has been cleaned and cared for well.

Round count on the rifle itself is unknown as I bought it used a couple years ago. Like all Polytech's, this rifle is well built and has run 100% since it's time with me. I upgraded the rear sights to Beretta GI sights. The barrel on this particular rifle is very accurate. With my 178grn AMAX handloads it will print 0.5"" and less groups at 100 yards.

The scope is a Vortex Viper PST 2.5-10x mounted in Warne quick-disconnect rings, with a Sage stripper clip rear mount. I haven't had any problems with the mount and rings shifting at all, and it is a solid setup that makes 500 yards exceedingly easy. 

Also included in the package are 3 Korean 20rd magazines that have run 100% reliably. Not pictured, but included in the package is the original Polytech 5rd magazine that the rifle came with. Also pictured, and included is a new-old-stock TRW stripped bolt, never used, and a used GI piston assembly. 

$3300 takes everything pictured. I would like to sell this rifle as a package with everything pictured. For buyers interested in the whole package, I'll throw in the original Chinese stock that it came with, plus a GI wood stock as well. I will sell just the rifle minus the scope if the buyer is interested. I am also willing to take serious local buyers to COSSA to shoot this rifle with my handloads, and I will also meet half-way within a reasonable distance if you live in Portland/Salem/Eugene/Albany. Feel free to email me for more pictures.

I will entertain partial trades for the following:
-Full size steel frame 1911's 
-Heavy barrel bolt guns in .30 and 6.5 caliber"

Umarex H&K Heckler Koch MP5 A5 - 22lr
This is the first official Heckler & Koch MP5 chambered in .22 LR. Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5 is engineered as a dedicated .22 rim fire rifle. It's built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. They are proportionate in size to the center fire version's magazine to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine.

In 1939 the Finnish Army and Civil Guard adopted a standard rifle known as the M39.   It is similar to previous models, but with improved barrel bands and a double sling swivel configuration making it suitable for all types of troops.   It is easily recognized by its pistol grip stock although early stocks are ""straight"" like the M27, M28, and M28/30.M39s were produced by SAKO (Suojeluskuntain Ase ja Konepaja Oy) and VKT (Valtion Kirvaaritehdas) and Tikkakoski M91 barrels were also cut down to build M39s.Some SAKO rifles have the Civil Guard Sk.Y (Suojeluskuntain Yliesikunta) logo and there are also ""B"" barrels fromBelgium although the rifles were assembled inFinland. M39s are well known for their accuracy and were produced for match shooting and training in the late '60s and early '70s.

Almost new (less than 500 rounds through it) Windham Weaponry AR-15 with Army Combat camouflaged UTG Pro Quad Rail and Magpul Foregrip along with ten 30 round magazines (two Magpul, one steel, and the rest Tapco II).  The rifle also has a fixed front and rear flip up (the sights are Diamondhead) and a Picatinny rail that can be used for mounting optics. I also have the original handguards that came with the rifle. The rifle barrel is 1:9 right hand twist and is chrome lined. 

One of the biggest highlights: this rifle has lifetime warranty and can be transferable to any owner!

This is not a picky AR-15, I have shot everything from Tula, Wolf, American Eagle, PMC, and Ultramax. I have not had a single malfunction so far. I regularly clean my rifle so its in very good condition. Speaking of ammunition, I have nearly 200 rounds of it(mix of American Eagle and Ultramax reloads) and I am throwing this in the sale as well.

Good luck trying to find a rifle along with all these magazines right now, or even in the next few months. Many companies are so back ordered that it will take them nearly a year to catch up in production (and this is after all this political drama is over).

I will be willing to ship the rifle, BUT you must pay the transfer fees. Plus, shipping ammunition may incur extra charges so we can negotiate on whether or not you want the ammo included. I prefer an Illinois resident near the Chicago suburbs as that is where I am located, but shipping the rifle is not an issue. 

As for the price....just to let you guys know, right now at the gun stores, they are selling junk AKs for 2600 dollars. Don't believe me? Just go there and check. We can negotiate on the price somewhat, but don't expect a massive discount or bargain, especially with what is going on right now. Think about it....ten 30 round magazines with a quality made AR-15 along with ammunition...not too many places have that right now."

This gun is a late war Garand. This is one of the best firearms ever produced and one that has frequently been credited (at least in part) with winning WWII. The action functions well and feels very tight. The bore and rifling condition are ok. There is a bit of wear and dirt, and some minor erosion. The outside barrel is stamped with the importer Blue Sky Arlington, VA. No visible signs of overstamping or out of roundness. The stocks are serviceable with very few dings and show evidence of a refinish. The wood is sound and smooth, likely refinished, and no markings are visible. The gun is mounted with standard M1 Garand sights, with the locking bar on the windage side. Overall finish is Parkerized.

The price includes shipping/handling. Missouri residents must pay 6.225% state sales taxes. This firearm may only be shipped to a licensed dealer (FFL Holder) or a C&R holder. It is your responsibility to determine that this item is legal in your area. No returns on new items, and contact the manufacture for warranty info. Please ask all questions before purchasing."

Sale is for:
New In Box Bushmaster Carbon 15 (see below for details)
100 rounds factory 556

AR15 Bushmaster Carbon 15 W/16” chrome-moly steel w/chrome-lined bore/chamber, 5.56 NATO/.223 Remington, weighs 5.7lbs unloaded.

This gun is new in the box, unfired, never even chambered. It has a 6 position collapsible stock, Bushnell red dot 1X30 scope, and 1 (factory) – 30 round mag. (sight was removed from box and mounted for picture sake).

CATCH - I will NOT sell to just anyone, therefore you will encounter a $30 charge (in addition to the sale price) to go through an FFL. You can pick one, or use mine (only avail Tues-Fri, sometimes Mondays). This means you will pay me (see payment methods below) at the FFL (you will walk away immediately with the ammo) fill out the background check, and pay the FFL $30 when your check comes back. Be aware, there is a 6-7 day lag on checks right now, so the FFL will hold your gun during this time. Sorry, that's just the way it is (similar procedure as to buying in an online auction, or even from a dealer locally). If you want to bypass the background check you'll need to go elsewhere.

Payment - Cash for local, see below for shipping
NO CERTIFIED CHECKS, NO MONEY ORDERS.

If this ad is still up, chances are it's still available.
If you leave a message, leave a name and number as I don't have caller id.

Want it shipped? USPS money orders only. When the money order clears (just have to call with the MO #, immediate clearance), I will ship to your FFL (must email me FFL info, or include with MO). No cashiers checks or other money orders taken in case of shipping.

This is new production Mil-Spec ammunition with crimped and sealed primers and solid brass casings loaded into corresponding ammo cans by the original manufacturer, WCC. WCC is the acronym Winchester uses for their mil-contract ammo which is manufactured to strict NATO specifications. ---This is not loose ammo placed into an existing can--- As seen in the picture each can and banding have matching lot numbers meaning this is all original. Each round is in the bright, pristine condition as the day it was loaded. There is no patina or tarnish .... 

The M855 projectile features a 62 grain full metal jacket around a lead core with a steel penetrator tip. The rounds are preloaded on 10-round steel stripper clips and banded to make loading of magazines quick and easy. The ammo can has the original factory locking seal secured to ensure quality and ultimate corrosion resistance. This ammunition is ideally packaged for long-term storage.

This is an internal laser. Nothing to get knocked off or lost. 

A Glock 21c is a fantastic weapon but coupled with the laser, it is a show stopper. That pulsing laser alone will do more to prevent crime than a squad of police cars.

This is a Gen2.5 meaning no rail. It comes with the Glock box, 2 Glock mags and a new in plastic Fobus holster I bought from Israel. Good stuff!

There are quite a few 7.62x25 jungle conversions that came out of Vietnam and are mostly very crudely done out of a lot of worn and junk parts. This gun appears to be mostly WWII original Colt parts. I tried to show in the pictures the careful welding and machining that was done on this one. Notice how nicely the slide face is machined and the extractor moved over for the smaller cartridge head and the ejection port is opened for the longer case. Also look at the magazine well and how it is relieved both front and rear by machining instead of just grinding it larger. The High Standard barrel is sleeved and reworked and the bore and chamber are nice and shiny with no pitting or corrosion. When you look at the assembled gun it looks like a standard Colt until you look closely.
