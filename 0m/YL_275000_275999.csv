This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50 or can be negotiated in the price. This gun has never been fired.

From an online seller: ""Made in America, and Priced Right!"", is the motto for the Henry Repeating Arms Company, named after its founder, B. Tyler Henry, forefather of the firearms industry. The Henry Lever Action .22 is a classic western-style lever action. It features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns four times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth - so smooth you will not believe it. The Henry Lever Action .22 also features side ejection, an adjustable rear sight, a hooded front sight and the receiver is grooved for a scope mount. The blued steel barrel features state of the art multiple groove rifling, making the Henry Lever Action .22 extremely accurate. Every single part in the Henry Lever Action is made in the U.S.A The barrel length is 18 1/4"", the overall length is 36 1/2"", and it weighs only 5.5 pounds. The magazine capacity is 15 rounds in .22 Long Rifle, 17 rounds in .22 Long, and 21 rounds in .22 Short. The best feature of the Henry Lever Action .22 is the affordable price. Suggested retail is only $329.95, about half the price of the competition."

I am the original owner and I have only taken it to the range a couple of times. This revolver is a blast to fire.

It comes with the original box, paperwork, and a El Paso Saddlery holster I had modified to fit this revolver. The holster is pig skin lined and fits like a glove. No one makes holsters for this guy yet, and I just couldn't stand sticking the revolver in nylon, so I had my local boot shop modify the leather to fit.

These Draco AKs are 100% Romanian made. They are merely imported by Century, but they do not touch them! Due to 922R rules not affecting the importation of pistols, these are fresh off the Cugir factory floor. You will not find a more original AK in the states.

Capable of chambering both .410 gauge 2 1/2"" shotshell and 45 Colt ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the 45 Colt ammo.

I have a springfield XD9 subcompact 9mm with its original case. This gun is literally as new as you can get. It came from the factory with the 1 test fire bullet shot through it and since then has only had 3 additional bullets fired through it. No issues what so ever. Gun looks and worked flawlessly, however, I do not need a gun so I am selling it. I am selling it at what I consider a fair price considering external gun sites all want 540$ + taxes + the shipping + the fee for a fll licensed store to transfer it for you (40-70$). And on top of my price being well below 100$ off, it also comes with an extra soft holster, extra mag, and pinky grip extension.

So you will get: the gun, 2  magazines (13 round and 16 round) and an pinky extension option. Have the hard plastic and a soft holster. Has the original cleaning rod and everything that originally came in the case. The case itself with all the original padding.   Extra magazine holder. Tool to work on the gun. and the speed loader. The cleaning rod. The cable to lock it up and the key. 

This is rated one of the best handguns of all time. Springfield is known for their superior support. It is a great handgun for conceal carry. Asking 520$ or for trade for a Walther P99C AS 9mm

The trigger is firm and has a clean crisp break and the lever action cycles just like new and sends those brass cases flying up in to the air. I like Marlin and Rossi lever guns but you haven't experienced a true lever action until you shoot a pre-64' Winny!

The receiver has NEVER been drilled for a scope mount and the wood is in excellent condition There are a few slight blemishes on the lower side of the receiver (pictured) that I chose to leave alone and not have re-blued as to not destroy it's patina and value. I lightened the pictures quite a bit to show but in your hands the scratches are far less noticeable.

I hate to let this fine example of an amazing quality lever gun go, but I'm a hunter and can't see myself destroying the value of a 60 year old Winchester by dressing it up with a scope. So I want to offer it up to someone who will appreciate it as I have and keep it in their family. 

There is no paperwork on this rifle but I will include a soft rifle case and a box of 20 Winchester Super X soft point rounds.

I may do some trading plus cash for ONLY a few models of rifle or pistols but prefer cash and bill of sale. 
Marlin or Rossi 44. mag + cash.
S&W M&P 9mm full size only + cash.

$700.00 or best offer takes it home.

I follow gun values quite a bit and know that this rifle is in the 750-900 dollar range so please don't try to cheat me on trades or low ball me.

This pistol is very finely designed and crafted.  The frame is black polymer, the barrel, slide, and other components are satin stainless steel.  
   This is a  striker fired pistol with a VERY smooth and light trigger pull.  It can safely be carried fully loaded, and still be ready to defend instantly.
  If you have never tried the trigger on a Kahr, you are going to be surprised at how smooth and effortless it is.  Great engineering!  
   This is an ideal CCW pistol, especially for those with medium to large hands.  (Women also find it easier to shoot well than the micro types.)  You can get all of your fingers on the grip, which increases speed on target, accuracy, and rapid follow up shots.  It is very flat in profile, making it easy to CCW.
  Gun originally cost $429 (plus tax) with only one mag.  Extra mag costs $35.  This gun comes with TWO factory 7 round mags.
  With one in the chamber, you have 8 shots ready to go, and 7 more in the spare mag, totaling 15 shots.
   Very accurate and reliable with low recoil. Excellent sights.  Around 150 rounds through it (no jams).  Its just about through the factory recomended 200 round break in period."

Lighter than a lot of modern 22's.  Perfect to learn shooting or to practice target shooting.  I have only put about 20 magazines through it.  I had a few FTF's.  The magazine needs to be taken apart and cleaned. Series 2 Woodsman, such as this, can handle modern ammo just fine.  This also comes with a leather holster from around the same period as the gun.  The gun is in used condition.  This isn't a museum piece.  Look at pics to judge condition.  $400 obo.  Cash only.  Not really interested in trades at this time.

This pistol has been fired 140 rounds. Comes with the original box, 2 magazines, extra back-strap, all accessories it originally came with. Also comes with a Blackhawk CQC leather concealment holster. The following is from HK's website:
HK45 Compact

Smaller in length and height than the standard HK45, the HK45 Compact (HK45C) uses a slim-line grip profile, otherwise is nearly identical in features to the full-size HK45.

Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life.

Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. The HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 Compacts can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 Compact comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.

Both the HK45 Compact and full-size HK45 use an improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever. The control lever is frame mounted and is quickly accessible; it has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 and HK45C can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45C is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system, providing an enhanced double action trigger pull.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45C is currently being made at HK’s new American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Sig Sauer 522 with the factory 551/552 stock, This is how I bought the rifle, the previous owner said it was in this set up when he bought it new, the stock folds and locks up perfectly, as if it was done at the factory, I have been told this it could be a very early model, and possibly the wrong stock was put on it, either way, It looks much better then the standard 522 stock they come with now.

I did add the factory Sig tri-rails onto the fore grip, and I also added the MagPul flip up sights to the rifle, and the K-grip does stay on the rifle also.

The ACOG scope DOES NOT GO WITH THE RIFLE !!

The only thing I would be interested in trading would be a SIG SAUER 522 PISTOL, IN THE SWAT MODEL.

If I do sell it, the price would be 500.00, as this is a great price, as I have not seen one with the 551/552 stock on it, and the MagPul sights are not cheap, this is a very nice set up..

It does come with the original factory SIG hard case."
