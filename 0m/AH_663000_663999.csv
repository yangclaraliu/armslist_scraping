Specifications Length 8.70 inches Width 1.66 inches Weight Empty 6.4 ounces Weight Loaded 2.02 pounds Description MAG5-60 The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest.

This rifle is modeled after the AR platform however the take down pins are farther apart than the AR-10 and AR-15 rifles causing the rifle to not accept an interchangeable upper like the AR-15 and AR-10 platform.

Sig Sauer Website Decription:

The SIG SAUER® P220® defines accuracy – and reliability – in a .45ACP. But many SIG shooters have asked for a P220 with a longer slide, one that would compete head-to-head with other five inch barreled 45's. The result? The first P220 Match prototype went to our testing range where it shot an eight-round group measuring 0.64” at 20 yards. Our engineers after extensive review concluded that this was a good starting point.

The P220 Match Elite adds the most sought after features to the P220 Match - beavertail stainless frame, front strap checkering, adjustable target sights, SIG's innovative Short Reset Trigger (a DA/SA trigger system with a 60% reduction in trigger reset) and black anodize aluminum grips. (NOTE: Grips shown have been discontinued. We have replaced with a similar grip without the white SIG SAUER logo. They have just a stamped logo).

The P220 Match Elite defines the new standard in .45ACP performance."

The stock has the “DAL” Inspector’s cartouche on the left side, and the “circle “P” mark behind the triggerguard. The rifle has a checkered metal buttplate and a knurled cocking piece – a word about that, as we know a knurled cocking piece may be a concern for some - While a ‘standard” Camp Perry rifle did not have a knurled one, it was an available option as per J.C.Harrison’s book, “The Collectible ‘03” –the source we used to authenticate this rifle. The rifle is in excellent condition, the original finish is wonderful, rating 94%. Stock condition is excellent as well, rating 95%. The star gauged crown gauges less than a “1’, and the bore mint – shiny with crisp rifling. This rifle is all original and correct, and it’s a museum-grade specimen that belongs in an advanced collection. Please do not send us an email regarding this item unless you have a sincere interest in purchasing it, thank you!

[b]Caliber:[/b] .45acp

[b]Item Description:[/b] I've got a rarely seen Smith & Wesson SW99 in .45acp. It's almost identical to the Walther P99. I bought it a couple years back after owning a Walther P99c and loving the AS trigger on it. The SW99 has the same sweet trigger, but with a bigger caliber. Shortly after getting it I upgraded the sights (front night sight & rear U sight, the two dot one can be switched in if wanted) and swapped out the stock plastic guide rod for a custom stainless steel one. It comes with three mags and a custom kydex IWB holster I made for it (it's not pretty, but it works). These guns have a unique SA/DA striker fired trigger with a well integrated decocker that is very easy to shoot well and has a very nice reset. The Smiths unlike the Walthers have a stainless steel slide coated in Melonite with both forward and rear cocking serrations. It has just a little bit of carry wear on the front of the slide, but it shoots great and much softer shooting than you'd think with how light it is (25.5 oz). It makes a great winter carry gun under a light jacket or sweater or even a night stand gun .

EOTech 512.A65 Holographic Weapon Sight – 65 MOA Ring w/ 1 MOA Dot
Authentic – In Stock
Description
When the situation is critical and lives are on the line, difficult conditions and awkward positions become your best friend and your worst enemy. Rapid reticle-to-target lock-on is a necessity, not a luxury - particularly when the target is moving, shifting, and evading your advance. The stakes are high - success is mandatory; this is why you're equipped with the EOTech HWS. 

EOTech's holographic technology employs a laser to create a virtual image of a reticle pattern in the heads-up display window. The reticle's pattern is embedded in the window - there is absolutely no light projected onto the target plane. 

The HWS ensures significant gains in speed upon initial weapon presentation, and target-to-target shot placement. Seemingly effortless follow-up shots can be executed with unprecedented speed and accuracy. When deployed in CQB environments, the EOTech allows maximum peripheral vision by allowing the operator to take full advantage of a heads-up and both-eyes-open sighting technique. 

The EOTech HWS has been standardized by the DEA, ATF and FBI SWAT. Because the HWS employs a true heads-up display it is a leading choice of military units like Stryker Brigade, 10th Mountain, and 3rd Infantry. The HWS eliminates the blind spots, constricted vision, and tunnel vision that is associated with standard tubular sighting systems. It is battle-proven to withstand the abuse from harsh environments, high-powered weapon platforms, and the toughest military missions. 

This is the model 512.A65 HWS - the control buttons are located on the rear of the unit to accommodate the use of a magnifier, and it is powered by a pair of AA batteries. The integral mount is compatible with Mil-Std 1913 Picatinny systems, and it has a knobbed, tool-less mounting bolt. This unit is submersible to a depth of 10.0' and the reticle is configured with a 65 MOA circle and a 1 MOA aiming dot.

 Here is an unfired FEG AMD-65 7.62x39 AK 47 As you can see it has the very cool skeletonized side folding stock so it is handy for home protection or easily stored away for future use. To keep it compact it comes with 1 brand new 20 round magazine that snaps in nice and tight. There are plenty of 30 & 40 round magazines available on line. The picture I posted is one I got on line. I did not take pictures of the one I have as it is covered in preservative. This is the older version that has a milled receiver.

 I have owned several AK47s over the years and they are still the most dependable and durable weapons for SHTF situations. I am sure these rifles are the first on Hillary's list to ban. I found this in the back of the vault and decided to put it up for sale before that happens. It is my last AK47 so get one while you still have an opportunity. I can still do a face to face sale in Iowa if you show ID and shipping to an FFL in most states is about 35.00. This sale of this compliant rifle will be in accordance with state and federal laws. I can only sell to an out of state buyer through an  FFL in that state.
I do not need to sell it and it will only increase in value so the price is firm. I may also trade for a 8-10k generator. 

If you voted for a Liberal I have no inclination to sell this to you.
Thank You so much to all veterans!

Made for Rifle hunter's, We use high quality LED's that emit the color of light of your choice and our lights don't need replacement bulbs because they will last 100,000 hours of use and if one ever happens to go out we will replace it for free.


Destroyer with White LED - 190 + yards with a average scope.


If you have a scope that does well in low light these distances will be greatly increased and we have customers that have told us with their scopes that do excellent in low light that they can see animals out to 300 yards with our red Destroyer.

Hunting in Rain,Snow and high humidity will lower the max yardage you can see with The Destroyer or any light.

The Destroyer is about 7 inches long and weighs about 9 ounces with battery(s).

Runs on one 18650 rechargeable battery or two CR123A batteries.  

Run time with one 18650 battery- Red LED = 2.5 hours at full power, Green, White and Blue 2+ Hours at full power and then another 2+ hours with the light slowly dimming over that time.

Run time with 2 CR123A batteries will vary depending on brand but you will get about 1 hour of run time at full power on all colors.

Works great in all weather conditions. Hot or very cold temperatures will not effect the light at all but temperatures below 10 degree's will shorten the battery run times a little.

You will be able to mount the Destroyer to virtually any gun

We believe the Destroyer is going to revolutionize the way you hunt, Pigs, coyotes, foxes, bobcats, and all other kinds of predators at night. No more carrying those big bulky spotlights with heavy battery packs and then messing with red lenses to only watch you light output to be cut way down. No more trying  to use lights made for bow hunters that wont reach the distance you want to shoot."

The gun seems to be pretty accurate and the barrel is free floated. The barrel is a 1:8 twist. 
I bought this upper off of gunbroker a while back and unfortunately I don't know the brands of any of the components, but they all seem fairly decent. I did ding the picatinny rail in a couple of spots when I was hunting that you can see in one of the pictures. Also, I lightly scuffed the stainless steel barrel with a scotchbrite pad, because it was way too shiny. It would be very easy to buff the barrel out and get it shiny again.

One thing I noticed when I bought this firearm was the plastic shell around it and how would that affect performance . I bought it any way and went to the range with it and after a couple trips and a couple of disassemblies I noticed I had to re-zero it each time . Due to the fact that the shell is plastic and is constantly changeing due to the temp and re placement each time of the scope . To combat this I cut two notches on each side of the shell so I could access the weaver mount that is part of the reciever itself . Once a scope was connected to that , no more issues , no more varibles to get in the way . No matter what goes on with the cover the scope is unaffected . It is now a great little plinker with no issues . Maybe 700 rounds has been down the pipe . 225.00 is for the rifle itself + the 1 mag that came with it  , and for all I am offering the price is 325.00 Or seperate componants listed .

See pictures for description, there was a small area of rust at the muzzle end of the left side of the slide. I cleaned the rust off to the bare metal and then touched up the bluing so the bare metal wasn't showing.

Antique Japanese Nihonto Wakazashi sword from the Shinto Era.

Sword details;

This is an unsigned sword with an NTHK attribution to Hisamichi.

Hisamichi was a member of the Mishina School and there were several 
generations using this name. 

It is in reasonable polish there are some scuff marks on it but the details 
of the hamon and hada are clearly visible and all the detail can be seen. 

The fittings are fairly plain and in keeping with what is a quite austere and 
powerful blade  (typically mishina in my experience).

Shinto Era smith's worked from around 1650 to 1800.

I would put this sword to be very early Shinto, probably around 1650 to 1700.

This sword would retail well over 3500.00 if not more, as it is made the traditional way Japanese swords were made, and no Chinese junk here, superb craftsmanship on this blade, and all of the fitting as well.


This sword is papered also, which adds more value to it, it has NTHK papers."

This is a Stag Model 8 piston operated M4 pattern rifle.  This is a factory rifle and has the box and manual.  The only thing I changed was the pistol grip.  This has a 16"" barrel and flip up front and rear sights.  The gas piston is adjustable for when things get a little hairy.  As a piston rifle, these rifles run a lot cleaner than DI guns.


I am looking to trade this for a flat-top mid-length or M16 pattern rifle.  I would prefer a 20"" Colt but am also interested in Stag (Model 4) rifle and RRA (Standard A4).  I am only looking for factory built rifles.  No mix and match parts rifles please.

I am not looking to sell this rifle.  If I can't find what I'm looking for I'm happy to keep it, so any responses asking about a cash price will be ignored.  Please, no Taurus, Hi-Point, shotguns or junk guns.)

The rifle looks almost new and was manufactured in 1975.  The year of manufacture is important because in 1976 Marlin went from a forged steel receiver to a cast steel receiver and the forged is much stronger and operates quite smooth.  This rifle has had so few rounds through it that it will be a very long time before it'll break anything.  At my asking price of $450 I will include a stock pad with 8 rounds of ammo, a full box of Federal ammo and a hard case.  The rifle has a weaver/picatinny type scope mount on the top of the frame but no scope is mounted at this time.  If you use tall see-through rings you can still use the iron sights and you wound need to add a trigger extender to clear a low scope.  Very nice rifle at a very fair price.  Not really looking to trade but will listen to an interesting offer.  Please contact me through the email link and give your contact information and I'll get back to you.  Low-ballers will be ignored.  The rifle is clean and oiled and ready to shoot."

As the title states, like new Kel-Tec PF-9 chambered in 9mm semi-auto. Double action only, black polymer frame, and parkerized slide (not blued). This is a current production pistol with the metal magazine release button. Accessory rail under front of barrel for use if installing lasers, etc. Child proof lock and finger extension magazine base plate included. Rear sight adjustable for windage. Magazine capacity is 7+1. Barrel length is 3.1 inches. Overall length is 5.85 inches. Weight is 15 OZ. This in the most popular conceal carry semi-auto 9mm pistol on the market because of dimensions, weight, and reliability. This gun has less than 50 rounds through it and speaks for itself.  No FFl transfer fee.  $250 is a fair and firm price for this gun.  Compare/call around and see.  I will also through in 100 round box of winchester 115 grain fmj target loads and a box of 50 federal 115g fmj loads.  There are 30- 50 rounds missing total from both boxes.  Keep in mind, what is missing from the boxes is all that ever went through this gun."
