Selling my DPMS SASS .308 Rifle.  These are selling on GunBroker now for $2800 and you probably won't see another for a long time if the ban goes through as the Dems want.  This is in like new condition with only 10 rounds (used Federal .308 Sierra Match King 168gr BTHP) through it to verify sight of the scope (laser boresighted to get close first) and start of the break-in (yes I broke it down and cleaned it after every round of the 10).  You will see by my pictures that this gun is like new and I can promise you that you will not find one that is nicer!  I can provide more pictures upon request, but as you can see it is hard to tell that it has even been fired.

This gun will be sold with all the items seen in the pictures and as if you were buying it new.  Included are the factory flip up sights, hard case, rail covers, Harris bipod, cleaning kit, and two unused OE mags (the 10 rounds through this gun were fed by a Magpul 20LR PMAG).

This is a beautiful long range semi auto sniper rifle.  I have seen guys easily make 800 yard shots with this setup and this rifle was also in contention to be the Army's M110 SASS.  It gave KAC SR-25 a real run for the money which is over twice the price.

Selling for cash or cashiers check to fund another project.  If you are a resident of Indiana, you must show me your valid IN DL and LTCH to purchase.  If you are out of state, we are required by law to have this gun transfered to you via FFL and I am willing to do that.

Original Old West Single-Action Look, Size and Feel. Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger® Vaquero® has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority. It is often referred to as ""the gun that won the New West"" because of its widespread popularity among single-action shooters and cowboy action competitors.

The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk®, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800's

Everything from Para to Wilson, but this 1911 has got to be the greatest one I've owned. I took a Norinco government frame and slide (made from recycled railroad rails, some of the hardest steel in the world), gutted most everything, replaced with Ed Brown internals, and a EGW Trigger group. Had all the work done by Vanguard Custom and then had a hard chrome finish put on it. This thing will group like my Wilson, and could out last my military Colt. I wanted something that would go bang if it was under water, filled with sand, packed with mud, and then just wipe down without chemicals (That wasn't a Glock)...and this is IT. I've only put about 300rds through it in the time I've had it. It has mainly stayed in the safe. I'm open to trades for other firearms or firearm/optic combos.

An interesting historical piece, but still a shooter.  Finish is probably 75%.  Serial #5545, all serials match.  1 Correct magazine is included.  Original grips.  If you find the right person on one of the 1911 forums, you can figure out where/to whom this pistol was issued by the Norwegians.  Shows some wear, but that's to be expected in a 92 year old firearm.  Great present for a 1911 collector, only 32,854 ever made.

Right handed
Matte finish
For Sig Sauer P220, P226, P228, P229

Level 3 retention holsters have long been the standard for law enforcement duty use. The problem has been that many holsters that provide this level of protection are clumsy to operate and can prevent the officer from drawing his weapon rapidly under stress. The BLACKHAWK! Level 3 SERPA Auto Lock holster uses your natural drawing motion to release the weapon. No unnatural motion or complicated sequences to remember. Just grab and draw.

In the pictures above, the first picture is of the Matte Finish (non-reflective), and the image on the second line is the Plain Finish (slightly shiny). The last image on the first line is the Basket Weave Finish.

SERPA Technology Features: 
•SERPA Auto Lock System provides a quick, natural draw with immediate security upon reholstering to increase officer safety 
•Injection molded carbon fiber composite construction provides incredible strength
•Extremely light weight
•No snaps or hoods to accidentally open, weapon stays secured until you decide to draw
•Ease of training, same drawing technique for undercover, tactical and duty
All Blackhawk SERPA holsters are made in the USA"

Testing the waters here, played with a G26 today and was reminded how much I love them.

I have a Walther PPS 9mm that was purchased new by me approximately 3 months ago. Have put about 200 rounds through it, and carried it occasionally, but has mostly sat in the safe, no finish wear, scratches, etc. It came with a 7 round and an 8 round mag along with the case, fired shell, extra backstrap, paperwork, etc.

I have since purchased for it a flush-fit 6 round mag, an UBG Canute IWB holster in black leather, and a black leather Galco DMC duel mag carrier.

Cost of the gun new was $570. Flush fit mag cost me $55, Canute cost me $65 with a 4 week wait, DMC cost me $40, for a total of $730 invested.

I am looking to sell the carry package for $650. Only trade I would consider at this time is a similar condition 3rd gen Glock 26 9mm, with night sights, extra mags, ammo or cash to even up the value. Not looking to split up the package at this time. Only looking for a face to face transaction somewhere between Portland and Eugene. Pics to follow. Thanks!"

I also have a used HK91 synthetic stock set which is olive drab green to go with this, 5 20rd Magazines, as well as 100+ .308 7.62x51rds to go with it. Shoots decent groups at 100yds. Very well built battle rifle with a cold hammered forged barrel. I've owned several .308 heavy hitters over the years, I am bothered by the DPMS .308, certain ammo, not going to name brands actually pit the barrel in the dpms if you dont clean it right away, however the CETME is built for battle with a good chrome lining. The price is also way cheaper than an AR10, or an actual FN/FAL or HK91, with the same exact devastating ballistics against those darn trees!!

This gun is very accurate, has a fantastic single stage trigger, a very easy to acquire sight system with an oversized front dot,  and is a joy to shoot. It's just time for me to try an M&P. 

In the photo of the sights, you can see that the profile of the left side thumb safety has been narrowed. This minor modification dramatically  improved comfort while shooting  for me. I suspect it will for you also. However, if you wish to return the pistol to factory configuration I have included a drop in OEM FNH safety.

Brand New DB380


Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

MFG:  SC Fabrica de Arme Cugir SA (ARMS arsenal)

It is chambered in 7.62X54R (Russian) features a 18 1/8” barrel overall w/ flash suppressor welded. I have performed a reverse rivet process where all the rivets are welded flush into the receiver. The safety has an extended finger latch so you can easily activate/deactivate it. The PSL also has a Harris Bipod and 2 MOE Magpul rail sections attached to the sides of the hand guards.

All furniture is wood but I have refinished to make it look like synthetic. It also has a side mount weaver rail and includes a BSA Mil-Dot 6-24X40 scope w/ rings. BSA is not a very high quality brand but it matches the gun. It is always good to have an extra scope lying around too. The PSL is coated with Cerakote in Coyote Tan and Magpul Foliage Green™. I will do a lifetime warranty on the Cerakote application. PSL has 2 mags.

I also have 1000 +/- 100 or so rounds (not sure how many) of 7.62X54R Steel Core Penetrator (silver tip) non corrosive w/ Ammo cans and I have a black gun case I’ll include on a full price offer. Gun only is $1350 OBO

Until you’ve held and shot a Marlin, you don’t know what a lever-action rifle can be. The ultra-smooth cycling and solid feel are created through a superior receiver design, the finest materials and a flawless meshing of these high-quality components. To produce our trademark excellence, our lever actions are built to strict tolerances rivaling those used to craft custom rifles. Further, all major components of the action are machined from heat-treated, solid steel forgings. The Marlin lever action’s swift pointing characteristics, lightning-fast follow-ups, reliability and inherent accuracy have made it America’s favorite. And what started with the invention of the first flat-top, side-eject receiver in 1889 has led us to pioneer every major advancement in the lever-action category since.

A must-have for every gun collector. It has been in continuous production longer than any other rifle in America. Is it the tack-driving accuracy, superb looks or centerfire-like heft that’s made it such a historical fixture? Yes, in all respects, the Model 39A is incomparable to any rimfire in the world today. Remarkably, it can be disassembled in seconds with only a coin. Thanks to Micro-Groove® rifling, a special process that produces less bullet distortion and a better gas seal, this rifle punches tiny groups most other 22s can’t touch. The stock is crafted of genuine American black walnut and adorned with fine cut checkering.
