Good afternoon everyone,


I have a new factory RH Savage FTR stock for sale.  It was removed from a stock Savage 30"" 12FTR heavy barrel rifle right after receipt from the factory.  I decided (mid-stream) that I wanted to convert the rifle to F-class heavy gun format and went with another F-class type stock.  The stock is factory pillar bedded, with a small amount of Devcon applied (by the factory) to the rear of the recoil lug recess - for a tight fit to the recoil lug I presume.  The butstock top is factory pre-drilled for a cheek pad.  Mint condition throughout.  It has one pre-me pin-sized mark on the grip area (see pic) - other than that it's mint.  I have many other HD pictures I can forward to an email upon request.  The stock will include the rail attachment for the bipod.

$200 OBO FTF cash- South Denver area  or
ADD $20 shipped anywhere in the U.S. - UPS Ground -  using the same tube Savage shipped my F-class stock in.

Payment methods are negotiable over email.

Cheers,"

For sale/trade:
AR-15 lower receiver. I purchased this for a retro Vietnam era build but I ran out of funds before I got it completed. 
Great candidate for a retro or M4 clone, build as there is no big ugly roll marking and the selector markings are ""safe"" and ""fire"" not bullet markings. Serial # and manufacturer markings are on opposite side and are not very noticeable.
Built by Delaware Machinery.

I got bored today and built up the lower with the DPMS lower parts kit. The build was done very well (no scratches or dings).

Must be 21 as this can be legally built as a rifle or pistol, as it was registered as ""other weapon"" and has never had a stock on it. Must show valid WI ID.

Bought it and customized it for my wife to carry since she likes my full size 1911, but the compact has a bit more bark with the shorter barrel than she likes. Fired 50 rounds. Still needs to be broken in.

It has been Cerakoted with Magpul Foliage Green and Graphite Black. This pistol can be seen on the Cerakote website 1911 gallery of professional application pictures.

The trigger has been taken down to a smooth crisp 3-3.5 lbs.

Comes with box, papers, test shells, lock, 2 7rd mags, and an extra 8rd mag, which have all been Cerakoted Foliage Green to match the pistol.
Has a Wilson Combat Match adjustable trigger, and shock buffer.
Also has 75.00 VZ G-10 Slim Profile grips with Pearce finger groove panels underneath, which I have no use for since I do not have another officer size 1911.

I will not sell anything separate, everything listed is what comes with this pistol.

The Cerakote and gunsmith work has been done by Zeroed In at Robinson's Hardware in Cheney, Ks. I have receipts for all of it.
They have pictures of it in some of their ads.

Total cost of gun, custom work and parts came to around 850 with tax.
These guns stock/factory go for around 575.00 or more with tax, fees, etc. depending on where you buy it.

625.00 FIRM.

I dont have to sell this, not hurting for cash, will keep it if it does'nt sell for my asking price, so lowball offers will not get a response.

If you can buy the same pistol with all that has been done to it for less than this, you'd better jump on it.

Description:

M952V
The M952V Millennium® Universal WeaponLight attaches by means of an integral Swing-Lever™ rail clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. It utilizes one sealed LED unit to produce both brilliant white light and invisible infrared radiation for use with night vision devices. The white beam is configured for close- to medium-range applications. Changing back and forth from white output to infrared output is accomplished by a push/twist action on the M952V head, which self-locks into the selected output mode. The tailcap switch assembly features a momentary/constant-on pushbutton switch and a momentary-on tape switch (7-inch cable) that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. Available in Black and Desert Sand.

FITS: Rifles, carbines, or submachine guns with a forend-mounted Picatinny rail. (See our Picatinny Rail Forends to equip your weapon with multiple integral forend rails.) [NSN: 5980-01-597-4522]

Unfortunately, I just don't have any room for it, and I don't have anyone to pass it on to.

I haven’t been able to gather a whole lot of information on it other than the production date ran between 1936-1971 and according to the markings on the barrel, the gun can shoot .22 long rifle, and .22 short. I think it's a youth rifle but I'm not 100% sure. The barrel is a bit longer than the typical youth rifle but it's a single shot bolt action/rear cocking action which most youth rifles are.

Again, I just don't have room for it so I'm only asking $100. The price is negotiable. I am also willing to do a trade for it. I really need a 10/22 action. So if you have a complete 10/22 or just the action from a 10/22, I would be willing to trade for that."

I actually bought it from a friend when he bought a new bow, and he's the one who got me started hunting with it. I honestly don't know a whole lot about bows as I'm more of a firearms person myself. I used it a lot about the first year I had it other than that it's just been sitting in my gun cabinet for about the last nine months. It has been used quite a bit, I'd say it's in good condition, and still shoots great. It's a great bow, I loved it while I used it but I just don't use it much anymore & hate to see it just sitting there not being used.

It has a four arrow removable two piece quiver, a Cobra three pin sight, QuikTune arrow rest, LimbSavers, a camo wrist strap, and a Tru Fire release. The only thing it needs is a stabilizer because I sold the one I had on it to a friend of mine along with the arrows. The bow itself has a 29 in. draw length, 70 lb peak weight which it is set at, and a 58.5 in. string length.

The photos were taken before I sold the arrows so they are not included as I no longer have them.

I bought the bow without the extras (excluding the LimbSavers & quiver). So trying not to lose too much money & considering how long I've had it I'm asking $90 for it or best offer.

Word of warning, this is NOT a collector's piece. It's a shooter. Basically the person that will buy it will beat the crap out of it through courses or run 'n' gun stuff. If you're looking for something that's really nice and clean to put in the safe and take to the range, this is not the gun. If you want a great gun to get coated and then run it hard, this is it.

I have a Modernized MAK-90 AK that I'm looking to get rid of. I have put a lot of time and money into this rifle and am looking to get some of that back. The reason I'm selling it is to get an AR. If you have an entry level AR with a chrome barrel and chamber I may be interested in a trade. If you have one with a bit more than the basics I also have and XDm in two-tone OD/Black I could throw in (trust me, it's not going to go easy... like an $1800 trade because of how much I love the pistol). I may also be able to include a Mosin Nagant, not really looking to get rid of it, but it is a possibility.

Now, this is not a cheap firearm to begin with, on top of that I have upgraded and updated it to be sure that it is 922r compliant. Do NOT offer me $500. That's insulting and I will just turn you down. It does have a quad rail fore end and it works perfectly, every time. The ONLY thing it really needs is a new finish (very worn, mild rust pitting, etc) due to neglect from a previous owner.

If you buy it, you will get the rifle, three European steel mags and five Tapco mags. The rifle comes as it's set up with a Bushnell TRS-25 red dot (great, inexpensive red dot), Midwest rail system, Tapco stock (collapsible), Tapco grip and Tapco trigger group.

I have put about 630 rounds through the rifle (give or take) and have not had a single issue with the rifle. It is VERY accurate and holds a zero (through about 350 rounds) perfectly. I have it sighted in at approximately 30 yards, maybe 35.

Email me for pictures of the rifle. Email me with offers. 

Please bear in mind, that if you buy this and spend $300 more you will have a super reliable weapon that looks good and has all you need for a SHTF or home defense rifle.

I have had several offers on this weapon and nothing is really piquing my interest. I will be selling it by Sunday or just plainly keeping it."

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. 

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". 

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. 

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

I would describe the weight as medium weight. It’s a great shooting barrel that loves 165gn Hornandy loads. The rail system is a Daniels Defense Lite 9.0. The buffer tube has been changed out with a XH from Slash’s Heavy Buffers so it will use any MilSpec AR15 stock. The included stock is an VLTOR Emod. The heavier buffer helps soften felt recoil. Optics can be included for $800 more. The optic is a Leupold Mk IV LR/T 3.5-10x40mm with Mil-Dot reticule.

I designed this gun to make easy 500 yd shots while remaining light enough to hump around. It’s taken three deer over the last 2 seasons. The furthest shot was 160yds. With the factory Hornandy 165 grain loads, it will easily maintain 1”.

Also included are 10x Generation II 20-round magazines, a 10 round magazine, and a 5 round magazine.

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount. Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.

Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space

“THE 22SPARROW IS THE FIRST SILENCER IN THE WORLD TO OFFER THE PATENT PENDING MULTI PART CONTAINMENT (MPC) TECHNOLOGY, WHICH ALLOWS THE 22SPARROW TO BE EASILY DISASSEMBLED FOR CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE AFTER HEAVY USE.
Because the .22 LR round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time, it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue, .22 silencers must be disassembled for cleaning and regular maintenance.
Until Silencerco introduced the 22Sparrow, the only .22 silencers that could be disassembled for cleaning required a cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds. However, often the components of those silencers would be fused together and unable to come apart. Competitor products on the market have baffles in their .22 silencers that must be removed by twisting the outer tube around the baffles and/or sliding the outer tube off of the baffles. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the outer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the outer tube, there is simply too much buildup of fouling and lead to remove the outer tube in that manner.
Silencerco solved this maintenance issue with MPC technology and made it possible for shooters to disassemble the 22Sparrow easily after heavy use without the need of tools. MPC technology revolutionized take-apart silencers by containing the lead and carbon debris to prevent the debris from reaching the outer tube. This innovative design is achieved by applying two tube halves before sliding the outer tube on the rest of the assembly. When disassembling, the outer tube can be easily removed, and the tube halves are free to pull away from the baffles without having to rotate or slide. Just pull off the tubes, clean the components, and reassemble.” –silencerco.com"

Absolutely gorgeous.

Barrel: 3"" stainless steel, fully supported ramp bull. 
Trigger: Long Aluminum Match Grade, 5 - 6 lbs. 
Frame: Forged Aluminum Alloy, Black Hardcoat Anodized
Slide : Forged Stainless Steel, Satin Finish
Recoil System: Dual Spring, Full Length Guide Rod
Length: 6.5”
Height: 5”
Weight w/ Empty Magazine: 26 ozs.
Slide : Forged Stainless Steel, Satin Finish
Grips: Thinline Cocobolo Hardwood
Sights: Fixed Low Profile Combat Rear, Dovetail
Front, Tritium 3 - Dot

Includes: Three 9-round stainless steel magazines, holster, spare magazine holster (holds 2), box, lock, and instruction manual PLUS a Galco inside the wb ""Stow 'n' Go suede holster ($30 value).

This EMP is in excellent condition. Yes, it's been used, but done so respectfully. Always cleaned after every shooting session. You won't be disappointed.

The MSRP of the EMP is $1345. The lowest price I've seen one for is $1049. If you buy in-town you must still pay sales tax ($75); buy online and you pay shipping, sales tax, plus processing, background check fees, etc., pushing the price up. My EMP is much less and is already broken in. Not too bad for a weapon of this quality.

Valid Minnesota drivers license AND permit to purchase/permit to carry required.

The barreled action of M77 Standard is finished in a polished blue. The walnut stock is designed in the ""modern classic"" style. It is supplied with a pistol grip cap, rubber butt pad, detachable sling swivel bases, and cut checkering.

This rifle has had less than 60 rounds fired through it and is an outstanding hunting package and caliber from wild boar in Tennessee to white-tailed deer in Texas to elk in Montana. Package includes rifle and scope, soft-carry case, and sling. I no longer hunt things that don’t shoot back. Will negotiate some on price or will trade for Colt LE6940 in 5.56 NATO and excellent condition; will also consider other tactical carbine trade, but tactical carbine must have 1 in 7 inch twist, not the standard 9 or 10 inch twist.

I bought this off gunbroker.com about a year ago to use as a rough duck hunting gun in my layout boat.

It was bought new in May of last year (2011), I have been the only owner. I had new night sights put on it in June of 2011 shortly after getting it. Smith & Wesson was kind enough to send me a second magazine baseplate with the pinky extension. Includes all of the stuff that came with it new (backstraps, original sights, plastic case, 1 flat magazine baseplate, 2 magazines etc) as well. 

I want to bundle this up with the accessories I have for it. So, included are a custom Zlogonje IWB, its his model 2, in marbled mohogany with a black trim panel, a horizontal magazine carrier, 250 Sellier & Bellot 9mm FMJ, 70 Hornady Critical Defense, 40 Winchester PDX, and another 50 of assorted 9mm FMJ & JHPs.

I don't think I want to split it up, at least for now. Thats not set in stone though, feel free to email...gun just has to go first.

I'm in Steubenville, but I don't mind a moderate drive. Feel free to message me and we can discuss logistics, but I am looking for a FTF to Ohio resident, 21yo+, non-prohibited, etc. Prefer CHL holder.

$625 takes it all. May sound high for an M&P, I know, but if you consider the night sights, the ammo, holster, and mag carrier there's a lot more here."
