I am also interested in trades let me know what you have? 



From Taser's web site:

The technologically advanced TASER C2 is designed for your personal safety needs. Utilizing the same technology as our proven law enforcement models, it offers incredible take down power and unparalleled protection right in the palm of your hand.

TASER C2 is an Electronic Control Device (ECD) that delivers an incapacitating pulse that overrides the sensory and motor functions of the nervous system. This powerful Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (NMI) technology can stop even the most aggressive individuals, including those under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.

The C2 uses a replaceable cartridge containing inert, compressed nitrogen to fire two small probes that are attached to 15 foot (4.5 meter) insulated conductive wires. Energy is sent over the wires into the probes, which can penetrate up to two cumulative inches of clothing. The charge is transmitted between the two probes, jamming sensory and motor functions, and inhibiting muscular control. This NMI effect continues in 30-second cycles each time you press the trigger. The C2 can also be used as a direct contact stun device.


Advanced Features
15 ft. (4.5 m) range allows you to stop an attacker before s/he gets to you 
30 second electrical pulse allows you time to safely escape danger or keep an attacker down 
Bold laser sighting system helps you aim confidently and accurately 
Integrated LED light illuminates dark places to improve your line of vision 
Compact, lightweight design allows it to be easily and discreetly carried everywhere you go 
Long-lasting Lithium Power Magazine allows over 50 uses, ensuring you have power when you need it most"

EMF's Hartford 1892's were manufactured by the Brazilian arms maker, Rossi. By using updated materials and production techniques, the Model 1892's action is strong enough to chamber high pressure handgun rounds, such as .357Mag & .44Mag.

Note: In December 2008, Rossi Firearms sold their 1892 rifle manufacturing to Taurus International. Taurus has declined to continue manufacturing the Hartford 1892's for EMF. Therefore, as the current inventory of EMF Hartford Model 1892's is depleted, the various models will no longer be available. If you don’t already own one of these you better hurry and get one while you still can. Here is a link to the EMF Hartford site current as of September 2010 and the current prices for the gun I am selling.

Long Rifle, .357/.38SPL caliber, 24"" octagon barrel
EMF part # crr92rch35724 – Current Catalog Price $610.00

Note: Due to pressure from their liability attorneys Hartford added an unoriginal, really dumb looking wing-nut style safety to the top of the receiver of all currently sold models. Purists hate it and have to pay big bucks to have it cut off and smoothed over. The results are still far from the original looks of the 1892. Mine was purchased just before the safety lever was added. So if you like originality here is your chance to get it. And this is your chance to own a brand new NIB one for only $495. Cash only please. Check those photos. This is one beautiful gun!"

Remember the grips alone on this are $300, and it is a two-tone special edition, not just your run of the mill ultra-carry. Thanks for looking. As I have said, I won't sell for less than $1050, so please do not send me an offer for any less, if you do, the price will go up by $50 for failure to follow simple instructions."

It has an automatic feed tube which holds 15 .22 long rifles. This rifle was purchased new back in the early 90s. I have only put about 300 rounds through her. I can group 5 shots the size of a quarter at 50 yards with no problem (using match grade ammo). I never really shot much further than that, but I'm sure the groups would be close to that good out to 100yds. This gun is great for plinking and for target shooting.

This is an Ohio State Highway Patrol issue pistol. The frame is stamped with the OSP logo and a serial number. This pistol is a double action only and comes with 2-10 round mags. No box or papers. It is in great shape. This gun shows very little carry wear. I believe it was an armory gun only issued as a backup until primary gun was fixed. It looks like it has sat on the shelf most of its life.

This is a classic plinker and varmint gun, and one of the most accurate .22's ever produced. Highly collectible, as only 300,000 were made between 1936 and 1939. This is serial number 156XXX, which puts it in the area of 1937 for a date of manufacture.

First off is a Trufire, 4-finger, 3d hunter release (camo).  It is a four finger, thumb release, with the calipers.  These run over $80 new.  Its a good release but it changed my anchor points so I went back to a wrist strap release.  This thing is in like new condition as I only shot it about 30 - 40 times.  $50 FIRM considering its basically brand new.

Also, I have a half dozen (6) Easton FMJ (Full Metal Jackets) with the 400 spine cut just over 27"".  Original fletchings, diamond plate patter, very good condition.  I shot them a handfull of times.  One has a bust nock.  Great hunting arrows, durable, hit like a Mac Truck but too heavy for my setup.  $30.  

Redfield Lo-Pro 4x hunting scope.  Original Redfield from Denver, not the overseas junk that is being produced by Leupold these days.  Impossible to find as they are not being made anymore.  Would make a great ML'er scope or lowerpowered rifle (.357 rifle, 45lc rifle, 30-30etc.).  Quality is second to none and these are highly sought after.  Very Bright Glass!  $50

Mossberg Bolt action 20ga.  Very, very good condition.  Not the typical beat up old bolts.  Makes a great squirrel hunter.  I bought it because it reminded me of one I grew up hunting with.  Put it in the safe and never shot it.  Still sitting there.  Someone could use this shotgun!  Very, very clean for an older shotgun, adjustable screw down choke, ready to hunt.  $125 or may consider other trades (firearms).  I had a guy wanting to buy it but his email wouldnt let me reply.  If you see this its still for sale.  Please email me again.

There isn't a scratch on this gun and it's all original. It has the adjustable rear sight, adjustable trigger, polished feed ramp and the original factory Colt 8rd magazine. 

I shouldn't have to ad this to this ad but I will since it has happened so much already...

Please do not send me an offer of things like $425, $500 or even $600 unless you have a nice optic to go with the cash...This gun is worth way more than that so this type of offer is unreasonable and shows your intelligence level about guns"

I want $499 for several reasons. First off, the gun is in LIKE NEW condition. I have only put maybe 300 shots through it since January when it was bought. The gun also has TRUGLO nite sights installed. These normally run $125 and they've only been installed for two months. You can also adjust for windage! This great firearm also has a 3 1/2 lb trigger installed .. which makes it that much better at the range! I am including two 10 round mags and one 17 round Glock 17 mag as well! PLUS two pierce grips which extend the mag size to 12 rounds .. and it allows your pinky to rest on the grip of the gun!

Shoots great btw .. I have never had a single malfunction and the gun is just now reaching the ""broken in"" stage. Cleaned carefully and thoroughally after every use! I hate to give it up, but I want to go with a different caliber firearm. It's been good to me though!"
