Gen 3 w/standard Glock sights.   Has not been fired.  This is the slim frame model with the narrower grip circumference, making it easier for smaller hands to grip.  If you haven't had the pleasure of playing with a 10mm, here is your chance.  This thing is a BEAST with full-power ammunition.  Comes in the original Glock case with everything it came with when new, as well as four extra 15-round magazines (for a total of six).  If you don't want/need the additional magazines, we can work something out.  No pics, but we all know what one looks like, and this one is as new.  $600.

Prefer FTF transaction.  I can meet in the Springfield, IL area during the day and in Alton, IL evenings/weekends.  Will consider shipping, but only if it is on your dime.  No funny business -- all federal and ridiculous IL state laws will be followed (FOID, bill of sale, etc).  Thanks for looking!"

Stainless steel barrel with 1/8 twist, black custom flush-fit flash suppressor, quadrail and two-rail gas block, has custom 2-sided laser etched dust cover with two official 300 blackout logos and the blood-spatter logo from the movie ""300."" Comes with one Lancer Advanced Warfighter Magazine, and will also include 50 rounds of 147 Gr rounds of new brass 300 BLK stamped PNW ammo. $1100, FTF in Knoxville preferred, will ship in state without the ammo. Will make a great hunting rifle! Uses standard 5.56 magazines and BCGs.

Here are some specs and other info on 300 Blackout:
This system was developed to launch 30 caliber projectiles from the AR platform without a reduction in magazine capacity and compatible with the standard bolt.

Full power 115-125 grain ammunition matches the ballistics of the 7.62x39mm AK, and eclipses 5.56mm with much higher-mass projectiles for a more dramatic effect on the target. Or choose subsonic cartridges for optimal use with a sound suppressor - 220 grain Sierra OTM (open-tip match) bullets vastly outperforms a 9mm MP5-SD in penetration and long range accuracy.

Ammo and brass prices are low - Remington 115 grain UMC ammo is $12.99 a box MSRP - and it is not bare bones. It has waterproofed primers, crimped and cannelured open-tip match bullets, and a low-drag design.

At 300 meters, 300 BLK has 16.7% more energy than 7.62x39mm. Max effective range, using M4 military standards for hit probability, is 440 meters for a 9 inch barrel, and 460 meters for a 16 inch barrel. 300 BLK from a 9 inch barrel has the same energy at the muzzle as a 14.5 inch barrel M4, and about 5% more energy at 440 meters - even though the barrel is much shorter.

For hunting - think of it as like a 30-30 but from an AR. After you are done, you can remove your 5-round magazine and put in a 30 for plinking or home defense. For ammo, Remington has you covered with the Premiere AccuTip 125 grain. Want industry-wide support? Over 60 companies have already announced or sell products.

Due to the high efficiency of the cartridge, less powder is used than 5.56mm, which results in a rifle that is a comfortable to shoot - even with a short barrel.

Reloading dies available from Forster products, Reamers and headspace guages available from Pacific Tool and Gauge.

DESIGN OBJECTIVES
• Create a reliable compact 30-cal solution for the AR platform
• Utilize existing inventory magazines while retaining their full capacity
• Create the optimal platform for sound and flash suppressed fire
• Create compatible supersonic ammo that matches 7.62x39 ballistics
• Provide the ability to penetrate barriers with high-mass projectiles
• Provide all capabilities in a lightweight, durable, low recoiling package

REASONS 7.62x39 WAS NOT CONSIDERED
Extreme cartridge taper
• Reduces reliability of feeding in AR Magazines
• Reduces Magazine capacity
• Cartridge taper induces considerably higher bolt thrust-
exacerbating the AR Bolt's weaknesses
• Requires a larger Bolt Face which reduces Bolt Locking Lug strength-
exacerbating the AR Bolt's weaknesses
Limited projectile selection
• 0.311"" diameter not a common option in most modern bullets"

For sale/trade:
AR-15 lower receiver. I purchased this for a retro Vietnam era build but I ran out of funds before I got it completed.
Great candidate for a retro or M4 clone, build as there is no big ugly roll marking and the selector markings are ""safe"" and ""fire"" not bullet markings. Serial # and manufacturer markings are on opposite side and are not very noticeable.
Built by Delaware Machinery.

Must be 21 as this can be legally built as a rifle or pistol, as it was registered as ""other weapon"" and has never had a stock on it. Must show valid WI ID.

Looking for interesting trades (no lowball offers and I can't add any cash)

This particular rifle was built with USPSA or other 2/3 gun competition shooting in mind.  It has an extra long free floated hand guard that allows the shooter to grasp very close to the muzzle for very secure fast shooting.  This build would also look awesome and function great with a suppressor, I can send a photo for an idea of or how it would look. 

Weapon Specs are:    

•	Spikes Tactical lower 
•	Ergo grip
•	Crisp breaking mil-spec trigger 
•	5.56mm 1/9 twist barrel 
•	16” Heavy profile barrel for very accurate shooting 
•	Extra long Free floated hand guard
•	Standard A2 flash hider (for an additional $50.00 I will upgrade to a
        Rainer Arms Xtreme Tactical Compensator XTC as shown below)

The optic shown is a new Vortex SPARC red dot and complements this weapon very nicely.  In my opinion for the money its one of the best optics made, for $200.00 I will leave it on the carbine.  Some features of the optic are:

•	One-Piece Tube 
•	Fully Multi Coated Lenses 
•	Waterproof and Fog proof
•	Unlimited Eye Relief
•	Adjustable Dot intensity with a Night Vision mode 
•	Screw-in 2xMagnifier for long distance shooting or sighting the rifle in 

I am asking $900 for the complete rifle with standard A2 flash hider (NO OPTIC!) , $950.00 with Rainer Arms Xtreme Tactical Compensator XTC (NO OPTICS!), $1100.00 WITH Vortex optic, or $1150.00 for BOTH optic and XTC Compensator. 

This is a personal sale so there is no FFL transfer or sales tax.  Within reason I will meet with you to view this carbine.  Serious inquires only, be advised that I am NOT looking for any type of trades at this time, If you contact me with a “lowball” offer I will not dignify it with a response, no refunds, no returns, or no exchanges.

Also original HK and quality small volume builders like Arizona Response Systems. Will consider 9mm, 7.62, 7.62 X 39, and 5.56.

Will only consider PTR's with correct chamber fluting (unless the price reflects the cost to re-barrel to fix PTR's attempt at 'improving' something that needed no improvement in the 1st place), so send me a serial number (you can leave off the last digit if you want) and let me know if it's the GI model for any PTR's. Will also consider select Century C-93's as long as they function. The bolt gap will also be checked and the rear bolt face will be checked to make sure they did not do the grinding trick on it. Am not interested in any Century Cetme's or C-91s, unless the price is very cheap and reflects what it will take to resolve the inevitable problems, just too many problems with those. 

Not interested in any Special Weapons, Coharrie, Bobcat and Federal arms unless you are willing to sell it for a parts kit price, and that price would NOT be the price of an all German or even all contract parts kit because these guns are not built with all German or all contract parts.

Sorry for all the conditions and stipulations but the HK clone market is overrun with questionable guns from questionable builders and with sellers who think their gun is worth more than full retail just because they overpaid for it. I don't want to waste my time or yours."

I think that's it. Total value with rifle is around $3600. Everything goes for $3200, I will not sell the FN Five Seven separately, only with the package. If the rifle sells I will keep the Five Seven, just throwing it out there for a awesome combo. 



This is a package deal and how you see the rifle is how it will be sold. As is and in perfect working order. I purchased the rifle because I wanted to shoot one. If was a blast to shoot. Emptied one mag of 50rds. and haven't fired it since. The AR57 is basically a hybrid of a AR15 and a PS90. It uses the PS90 magazine and ejects the rounds through the magwell. I have over $1500 in this build. All parts are new except the red dot but it has hardly been used, plus its free so either way its a win. I did not spend the time sighting it in because I knew I wasn't planning on keeping it.

I have a Ruger 10/22 that I bought new and planned on turning into a target rifle but plans and priorities have changed. It started out as a maple stock plain 10/22 when I got it. I have since trued and polished all the friction surfaces of the bolt and removed the overspray paint from the bearing surfaces in the receiver. The bolt now rides way smoother than it originally did, the action feels a lot smoother. I also installed swivel studs for a sling and the rifle will come with the sling pictured. I also installed a 2x7 power illuminated mildot scope which fits the rifle nicely.

One thing I hate about 10/22s is the absence of a cleaning rod hole in the receiver. I like to clean rifles from the chamber to the muzzle so I took the receiver to my fathers machine shop and drilled a hole for a cleaning rod. It lines up perfectly with the barrel and looks factory.

The bolt lock function of the rifle was left alone, I did not do the bolt lock release mod simply because I only use the bolt lock to transport the rifle and didn't want the bolt going closed in my car while transporting it and have storm troopers pull me over and arrest me.

All in all its a nice rifle that has been fully gone through and tweaked. You can buy one of these new for 220 plus around 15 for tax and I have another 60 in the scope and 20 in the sling plus my time polishing the bolt and drilling a hole for a cleaning rod so 220 is a reasonable price for someone that wants a scoped 10/22 with some basic mods already done. It has fired approx 300 rounds and killed 1 skunk since I bought it and has been cleaned after shooting every range session and hunt. 


I will not ship, no trades, and will only deal ftf with people from Ohio only with a state id."

either cash or trade value, no bullchit.. got 1900 cash come get it..Will not go lower. cost to get it inspected is about 60 bucks and all they are looking for is stolen parts... not quality of work performed...This bike is all org with all factory parts. So no I will not sell it for 900 stop asking.

It is a very nice example of a clean, upgraded, well working MP5A4 but I really have no use for it anymore. I'd rather put the money towards purchasing my first house.

 2 Tokyo Marui low-cap magazines
 Three point tactical sling

They fit tight in my WASR-10/63, a little looser but still good with a Hungarian AMD-65 build. They can easily be filed down as they are polymer if they are too tight for your AK. No tax just 100 bucks and 10 brand new AK mags are yours. The only way I'd sell less then all 10 magazines is if you came directly to me.

Email thru armslist and I'll get back to you. I have more Tapco 30rd mags as well I was planning on keeping but will sell at 10 bucks a pop if you're interested.

And no the gun isnt for sale. unless you're in love with it then I'd throw it in for an extra $800 ;-)
