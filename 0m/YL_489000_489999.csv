The Standard Rifle model came with a 24” round barrel and plain walnut stock. This rifle has seen some use but is in fairly nice condition. It retains probably 96%+ original factory bluing and while the wood does show some handling, which one would expect of a gun which is probably 60+ years of age, it is quite solid and not all beat up. The stock does retain the original steel butt plate and sling swivel studs. According to my research Winchester began production of the Model 43 in 1949 and ceased production in 1957 reaching serial number 62,617. This particular piece is a 5XXX range so my hunch is it is a first year production piece but am unable to authenticate that date. The barrel is quite shiny with strong and pronounced rifling. As this rifle comes equipped with a 2.5 Weaver the front sight has been removed and the rear sight notch has been correctly filled with a Marble’s dove tail plug. The scope is an old style tube with standard cross hair reticule and is mounted on a Weaver detachable base. Please ask any questions you might have and I will respond as best I am able. thanks"

These are definitely NOT a mass produced “assembly line” rifle! We simply use the finest, GUN-KOTE™ premium metal coating & finish, for maximum protection of the rifle’s metal surfaces. It was first specified by the U.S. Military for use on SOCOM Special Sniper Weapons (SPR’s) in 2003. GUN-KOTE™ is superior to parkerized, blued, or air dry finishes in both durability and performance. GUN-KOTE™ satin matte black finish protects metal parts from rust, corrosion, & scratches and will not break down, peel or dissolve. In fact, once applied and heat-cured, the only way to remove it is through abrasive blasting. GUN-KOTE™ is resistant to all known gun solvents, oils, and thinners. GUN-KOTE™ is a highly specialized, hard, abrasion resistant coating that meets all military specifications for protective coatings. GUN-KOTE™ is formulated to provide excellent impact resistance, lubricity (meets military dry firing specs), heat dissipation, chemical resistance, corrosion protection, durability, and scratch resistance. It is specially formulated for salt corrosion protection and meets US Military requirements for ""Resistant to Chemicals"". GUN-KOTE™ has outstanding heat dissipating qualities, outstanding temperature variation durability (+800 degrees F to -300 degrees F), and outstanding lubrication qualities. The M4 six-position collapsible stock is manufactured in the USA with military grade polymer and a super strong machined aluminum tube. We include a custom machined steel side-rail installed on the left side of the receiver to provide you the option to mount variable power scopes. The double hook USA mfg. G2 trigger group delivers a crisp 3-4 lb. trigger pull. The original CHROME LINED barrel has a bayonet lug and includes mil-spec 14:1 left hand metric threads to attach any muzzle device. The slotted RPK style muzzle break has both slots and ports to help control the muzzle during rapid fire. The UTG® PRO quad-rail system is made in the USA from aircraft grade aluminum. The four mil-spec picatinny rails have integrated QD-swivel housings on left/right rails for accessories. Protective snap on black rubber rail guards are included. The Israeli pistol grip has ergonomic finger groves with a hinged bottom plate and a battery storage tube that holds two CR123A batteries. The TST vertical foregrip is ultra-light- weighs less than 4 ounces, and folds flat under the bottom rail to allow all mags and drums to be easily inserted and removed. PACKAGE INCLUDES a brand new South Korean 75 round rear load drum magazine (just like the original Chinese drums!), six (6) THERMOLD USA mfg. 30rd polymer mags, and two (2) original Bulgarian military magazines with steel lined feed lips.thanks"

It is a SA/DA semi auto pistol that has very low recoil characteristics. I purchased it new from Bradis Guns for $610. I love the gun but am looking for something smaller and lighter to carry, and can’t afford two handguns at this time. 

The CZ 85 incorporates ambidextrous features into the basic CZ 75 platform including RH and LH safety and slide stop levers as well as a reversible mag release. The B model has a firing pin block safety that restricts any movement of the firing pin until the trigger is pulled. This mechanism prevents discharge in the event that a dropped pistol lands on its muzzle with enough force that the inertia of the firing pin overcomes the firing pin spring enough to touch off the primer.

The CZ 85 Combat adds a fully adjustable rear sight, extended magazine release, drop-free magazine and overtravel adjustment on the trigger. The Combat designation comes from the lack of a firing pin block safety, allowing the replacement of the firing pin without tools. The lack of a firing pin safety gives the 85 Combat a slight advantage in the trigger pull department, making it a long-time favorite of competition shooters.

It comes with two 16 round mags, original box, receipts and accessories.

I I purchased this earlier in the year but I prefer my real AR-15 over this so I decided to sell it. I only shot 150-200 rounds through it without any problems. 

Included is:

- Mossberg 702 Tactical Plinkster w/ 10rd mag.
- An extra 10rd mag.
- Allen Company carry case 
- 1 Open box of 525 Federal .22LR 36 grain ammo, Maybe 325-375rds left. This is the only box of ammo I used for this gun.
- A second box of 525 Federal .22LR 36 grain ammo, unopened (not pictured)
- 3 point tactical sling
- Scope mount (not pictured)
- Box with manual (not pictured) 

I would prefer face to face, but I will consider shipping.

I really dont need to sell this gun right now so price is firm. I traded a rifle for a couple guns and this was one of them. Im really more interested in trade offers but will listen to cash of course. It has a quad rail with rail covers on it, two 20 rounds mags, a BSA tactical rifle scope made for accuracy and distance shooting, also as shown in these pics it has a tube extension to avoid sun reflection. It has 364 rounds of .308 ammo, has the original fore end if you dont want the quad rail. Mono grip and bipod to help reduce weight and steady shot for accuracy and a ammo can for extra ammo. 

*****Im firm on the price, The ammo is worth $250 at least and the optic is worth $250-300, so basically your getting this gun and bipod, quad rail, mono grip, ammo can ect. for $550. I have done research and this gun i have found from $850-1000, so this is a fair price for a person who is more interested n trades than money right now.

These are definitely NOT a mass produced “assembly line” rifle! We simply use the finest, GUN-KOTE™ premium metal coating & finish, for maximum protection of the rifle’s metal surfaces. It was first specified by the U.S. Military for use on SOCOM Special Sniper Weapons (SPR’s) in 2003. GUN-KOTE™ is superior to parkerized, blued, or air dry finishes in both durability and performance. GUN-KOTE™ satin matte black finish protects metal parts from rust, corrosion, & scratches and will not break down, peel or dissolve. In fact, once applied and heat-cured, the only way to remove it is through abrasive blasting. GUN-KOTE™ is resistant to all known gun solvents, oils, and thinners. GUN-KOTE™ is a highly specialized, hard, abrasion resistant coating that meets all military specifications for protective coatings. GUN-KOTE™ is formulated to provide excellent impact resistance, lubricity (meets military dry firing specs), heat dissipation, chemical resistance, corrosion protection, durability, and scratch resistance. It is specially formulated for salt corrosion protection and meets US Military requirements for ""Resistant to Chemicals"". GUN-KOTE™ has outstanding heat dissipating qualities, outstanding temperature variation durability (+800 degrees F to -300 degrees F), and outstanding lubrication qualities. The M4 six-position collapsible stock is manufactured in the USA with military grade polymer and a super strong machined aluminum tube. We include a custom machined steel side-rail installed on the left side of the receiver to provide you the option to mount variable power scopes. The double hook USA mfg. G2 trigger group delivers a crisp 3-4 lb. trigger pull. The original CHROME LINED barrel has a bayonet lug and includes mil-spec 14:1 left hand metric threads to attach any muzzle device. The slotted RPK style muzzle break has both slots and ports to help control the muzzle during rapid fire. The UTG® PRO quad-rail system is made in the USA from aircraft grade aluminum. The four mil-spec picatinny rails have integrated QD-swivel housings on left/right rails for accessories. Protective snap on black rubber rail guards are included. The Israeli pistol grip has ergonomic finger groves with a hinged bottom plate and a battery storage tube that holds two CR123A batteries. The TST vertical foregrip is ultra-light- weighs less than 4 ounces, and folds flat under the bottom rail to allow all mags and drums to be easily inserted and removed. PACKAGE INCLUDES a brand new South Korean 75 round rear load drum magazine (just like the original Chinese drums!), six (6) THERMOLD USA mfg. 30rd polymer mags, and two (2) original Bulgarian military magazines with steel lined feed lips.thank"

My gun really is unfired and as good as purchasing a new gun. 

Comes with Sig Hard case, case lock, 2 magazines etc.

The SIG SAUER® P220® defines accuracy – and reliability – in a .45ACP. But many SIG shooters have asked for a P220 with a longer slide, one that would compete head-to-head with other five inch barreled 45's. The result? The first P220 Match prototype went to our testing range where it shot an eight-round group measuring 0.64” at 20 yards. Our engineers after extensive review concluded that this was a good starting point.

 The P220 Match Elite adds the most sought after features to the P220 Match - beavertail stainless frame, front strap checkering, adjustable target rear sight with glow in the dark night sight in the front. SIG's innovative Short Reset Trigger (a DA/SA trigger system with a 60% reduction in trigger reset) and black anodize aluminum grips. 

The P220 Match Elite defines the new standard in .45ACP performance.

I would consider a trade for a Dan Wesson 1911 in 45 ACP.

These Simmons .22 Mag Series Riflescopes are built just like their big-bore counterparts with 1"" tubes, fully coated lens and 1/4-MOA click adjustments. Reliable and rugged, there is a Simmons scope for just about any hunting application, and Simmons has redesigned all the scopes in this series. From rimfire to high caliber rifles, shotguns and pistols, Simmons has a scope to fit your needs. Each scope features TrueZero™ Flex Erector System for a nonshifting point-of-aim at all magnifications and adjustment settings. The Quick Target Acquisition (QTA™) eyepiece is a fast-focus system with a constant 3-3/4"" eye relief through all power ranges. That gives you faster, more reliable target acquisition through its optically superior expanded eyebox. TrueZero windage and elevation dials stay dead-on throughout the life of the scope with no deviation in click value throughout the full adjustment range. The Aetec model features Simmons' Aspherical Lens Technology, which gives you wider, flatter and sharper images from edge to edge. Each scope sports superior, high-transmission lens coatings.

This one was originally sold by Lowe's hardware store under the KOBALT brand name and would make an excellent, low cost alternative secure storage solution for firearms. (Adding your own safe de-humidifier, not included, would be a good idea.)

The outside looks like hell but the inside is in very good condition. I used it to store everything from electronic equipment to small power tools to spray paint cans and various other things you might find in a garage or workshop.

The box has undergone a number of color changes and endured countless rain and snow storms while preserving the interior contents remarkably well. Far better than I ever expected it would.

Originally bought the box new years ago for about $275.00 so they probably cost more new by now. I don't think Lowe's has boxes like this any more but there are a lot of other companies out there making them. The box is secured by using two of your own padlocks which are inserted into each of the two holes you see in the front of the box where they can not be reached by bolt cutters. (Padlocks not included.)

DIMENTIONS: 2ft. tall, 2ft. deep and 4ft. wide is the main box, not including the steel skids under each end. There is also a 3 1/2 inch steel troft inside.
There is a sticker inside it which says DAWS MFG.
