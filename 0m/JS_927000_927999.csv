For sale is an Interdynamics KG-99 with two original 32rd and one 50rd magazine. This came before the Intratec TEC-9 and was designed by Interdynamic AB of Sweden.

Unfortunately as you can see it is damaged and should see a gunsmith before it's fired. The frame is cracked at the magazine well and trigger area but the frame does not feel fragile at all and stays together when disassembling. The action works, the magazines fit and the firing mechanism does strike but that's as far as I will take it.

I have never fired this gun. It will be sold to the highest bidder with the understanding that it is as-is. It was left with me along with a few other guns by a friend who moved to CA recently

***THIS GUN IS BEING SOLD FOR REPAIR/PARTS ONLY DUE TO OBSERVED DAMAGE TO THE FRAME***

It could be a parts gun or rebuilt but it's up to the buyer to determine it's ability to be *safely* fired.

Now I see the hysteria created by the loons who have no soul and kill randomly creating this madness we are in now. Some have capitalized off this lunacy by getting prices that would have been laughable 6 months ago. I am curious about something though. Is anyone buying right now?  I see a lot of inflated pricing, but am curious if there have been any takers. I am fortunate enough to have my collection pretty complete, and not in need of the crazy priced guns.

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
 The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
 shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability
 and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct
 lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic
 ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

I also have 9 PMAGs (8 windowed, 1 solid, all excellent new cond.) and more than 300 rounds of XM855.

I've added a Burris AR-332 3x illuminated optic, BCM Gunfighter Grip, Magpul BAD Lever, Magpul Angled Foregrip, Smith Enterprise Muzzle Brake, and a PWS CNC 1-piece buffer tube. I also have set of angled iron sights installed right now but also have the MBUS set that came with the rifle. On the inside I've added a POF roller cam and solid retaining pin, this smooths out the harder recoil of the piston vs. gas tube.

I added the last two items due to some wear I was getting on the upper which I've been told is completely normal for a piston gun but I wanted to correct it anyways. This is pretty much the only wear anywhere on the rifle, everything else is in excellent shape. I also have a new Noveske upper that I can put on but I'll want some extra cash for that.

I've only shot high quality ammo through it and cleaned it after every day at the range. I get around 1-1.5 MOA out of consistently.

I'm thinking $1600 for it with the current upper, MBUS, no optic, $1700 with the Noveske upper (I keep the old one) add $200 for the optic. I'll sell the ammo and PMAG's for another $400."

I will consider all offers, but the way things are looking I may never be able to buy a rifle like this again so please take this into consideration.  I am really looking for a couple of high quality pistols for concealed carry.  If the market was the same as it was 6 months ago, and I could buy anything I want, I would buy a SW M&P Shield, and a Walther PPS.  So my perfect transaction, would be these two pistols, plus a little bit of cash and a face to face transaction.  Again, this would be the perfect scenario, and I know this is highly unlikely, but I though I would take my chances.  Let me know what you have and are willing to trade.

Colt LE6920 (M4 style)
2- 20 round magazines (came with rifle)
2- 30 round USGI magazines
30 round magazine (forgot which type)
Tactical bungie sling 1 point

Picatinny quad rail with 12 covers 
Composite grip with collapsible bipod and side rail (also comes with stock carry handle)

5 boxes of 20 rd Tulammo 223
Truglo red dot with pressure switch 
""Zombie Killer"" dust cover

Below is the description from Magpul.

Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) is a line of firearm accessories designed to provide a high-quality, economical alternative to standard weapon parts. The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality.

The PMAG 30 AR/M4 GEN M2 MOE Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M4 compatible magazine that offers a cost competitive upgrade from the aluminum USGI. It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

In addition, durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

The GEN M2 MOE is identical in form and function to the older model PMAG except that the optional Impact/Dust Cover is now sold separately."
