Trigger Mechanism: Pre-Cocked Striker System
The P99 Quick Action, with its uniform short trigger pull is the pistol of choice for both law enforcement tactical teams and competitive shooters. The P99 QA is easy to use with its repetitive trigger pull and with its four independent safeties; the P99 QA is one of the safest pistols available today.

Lightning-Fast Firing
The Quick Action trigger system: The striker is partially pre-cocked and when the trigger is pulled, the striker is fully cocked and released, firing the pistol. The trigger travel is approximately .31 inches with a trigger force of approximately 8 lbs. This short pull with its quick reset provides quick shot delivery especially in competitive situations."

BRAND NEW IN THE FACTORY SEALED PACKAGE

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

Features:

- Compatible with all weapons that accept standard STANAG 4179 compliant magazines

- Reliable functioning due to mechanical simplicity and high-quality non-binding coil springs—no lubricants required

No permanent changes are made to the shotgun when you install these kits!!

THESE KITS ARE SUPER RARE NOW, they are no longer manufactured so finding new drums/magazines is extremely difficult.  The best way to get more magazines is to buy new kits as they show up on various forums or auction sites. 

I am selling ALL OF THE ABOVE AS ONE package. I had wanted to build a shotgun around these kits but simply never did (my saiga took that honor). My lack of motivation is your gain! Each one of these kits can sell for up to 500 dollars, maybe even more given the current price increases on everything.

Many of the guns listed do not. Runs great, even cycles bird shot they sell at the local indoor range This shotgun has held its place as a true safe queen. The Saiga 12 gauge is based on the tried and true reliability of the AK 47. This is an ultimate and rarely sold Saiga 12 package, providing everything you could ever need from a semi auto shotgun. These shotguns were already on the ATF’s list to potentially restrict and ban prior to the current gun control talk.

Shot it during one shooting session with friends, figured it would be a good ""what if"" or SHTF tool, but I now would rather just trade it for something I'll use, since I've now realized its not my thing.

It works fine, but I kept it at a friends house while I was away for a few months, and they moved, and lost the bolts. So it just comes as it is.

Has a safety, and the foothold for cocking.

I'd prefer for it to go into a trade for something around $300 or less, taking $80 off for the bow, and the rest on my part for cash.
Guns, ammo, and knives would be considered. I'd be willing to lower my trade value if the right thing comes along.

All once fired from a range that only allows brass factory ammo. The large majority of it is headstamped lc, fc, r-p and ppu. I have more brass on hand that I need as I rarely shoot my AR, maybe 60 rounds a month. I really prefer shooting pistol. 300 pieces of brass are fully processed, meaning they have been tumbled, lubed, sized and deprimed, trimmed down to size, chamfered and deburred, primer crimp removed if needed and tumbled once more. This process is very time consuming unless you have very expensive case prep equipment. these 300 prepped cases easily save you 4-5 hours of time. The other 400 cases have been tumbled for a couple hours so they are pretty shiny and ready for you to lube, size/deprime, trim, chamfer/deburr, remove crimp, tumble etc etc.

277,http://www.armslist.com/posts/885277,"For Sale:  Beretta Stampede Nickel Revolver 5.1/2"" 45 Colt (o.b.o.$$/FT?)","West Allis, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 540,"Listed On: Sunday, January 20, 2013",Handguns,Beretta USA                                                                                ,45 Colt                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"I am selling my Beretta Stampede Nickel Revolver 5.1/2"" 45 Colt (Model 4528).  I purchased it from Gander Mt. Gun World in Germantown, WI, less than a week ago, for almost $650.  (I'll sell it for $540 o.b.o., now.)  I have all the paperwork and the original box.  I did shoot one box of 50 rounds through this gun and there are absolutely NO problems with this gun.

My problem lies with the salesman that sold it to me, or maybe my own ignorance.  I already have a single-action Ruger .357mag and wanted a more powerful gun.  Money being in short supply, I was thinking of selling my .357 to fund my plans.  Then, the gun salesman told me a .44mag and a .45colt were comparably equal, so I went with the .45, which was cheaper.  I found out [too late] that this is not true, doing my research after the fact.  {Hornady ballistics charts put the .44mag at muzzle speeds of 1150-1550 fps with energy levels of 880-1000 ft/lbs, while the .45colt is at 725-920 fps and energy of 300-460 ft/lbs.}

These comparisons are not a problem for somebody who is looking for a .45 Colt single-action revolver that looks amazing and shoots exactly as it is supposed to.  Anyway, the recoil was less than challenging, for me, and it's not satisfying my ambition to have what 'Dirty Harry' would call, “the most powerful handgun in the world.”  :o)

If all things are legal on your part and you would like to own this beautiful six-gun, it can be yours for $540 o.b.o.  I have cleaned and lubricated it again.  You can't get a gun much newer than this one, and  avoid the paperwork, 48-hour wait, and headache, by buying if from a private party.

Oh, I'd also like to have something like a Springfield .40 XD sub-compact pistol, if you'd be interested in doing a trade.

The following description of this .45 Colt is from Beretta's website (I used the pic from their site of this exact gun):

There’s no gun more quintessentially American than the single-action revolver.
The Beretta Stampede combines the feel and handling qualities of the original “hogleg” with a transfer-bar safety system that makes it safe to carry with all six chambers loaded.

The beauty is in the accurate details.  The fixed front sight is true to the original.
And with the frame dimensions closely matched to the 19th-century originals, the Stampede feels slender and very responsive in the hand."

I have only put a few round through this to adjust the sights and am not sure of the total round count. You can see it is in excellent shape with very few handling marks and no significant wear anywhere. The iron sights have been meticulously tuned in and this is now more accurate than my milled Norinco.  The laminated stock and lack of a bayonet lug indicates it is obviously a later post ban version. It is very hard for me to let go of, but I am slowly thinning the herd and this is next. The unused 30 round mag and a soft case is included, I never had the original box. The genuine Poly Techs are few and far between and this would be an excellent legacy to pass down to your grandchildren.

It is a 2 owner car and was garaged by the first owner until 2006ish.  Leather is still very good.  It needs brakes and exhaust and a battery.  I have the original window sticker and some extra air filters and oil filters.  This car has always had Mobil 1 synthetic since day 1.  Car has never been wrecked.  You won't find too many of these in this shape any more.  I think it has approx 195,000 miles and a rebuilt trans at 120,000.  I am in Highland MI.

-lower is a Stag arms(marked 5.56) w/ 6-position stock and a magpul miad grip kit. 
-Upper is a Spikes tactical M4-LE(1/7 twist 5.56 nato) with MOE hand guards and Mbus rear sight. the rifle functions great! really dont shoot it much.
i have extras i could add (like MI quad rail) for the right deal. just looking for a ""even-steven"" trade for a good Quality AK 47 or 74 in the realm of Arsenal, Saiga(converted) waffen or other brands in that category. does not have to look pretty as long as it functions fine.       **please NO century rifles**.
if interested let me know what you have to offer (AKs only). i live in chambersburg but wouldnt mind driving a bit for the right deal. FTF only i will not ship. could also trade mags as well along with the rifle (i have GI's and lancers). please dont ask for parts or mags separately. photo isn't great but i tried."

I bought this gun and mags new back in 2009 (have receipt to show this) and it has been sitting in my safe ever since.  The safety ""scratch"" on the receiver has not even worn through the finish to bare steel.  The safety has only been moved once or twice, and a round has never been chambered in this gun.

I still have the original box and paperwork (owners manual, etc) here somewhere, and will find it before completing the sale.

This AK was built in the Russian Izhmash factory, which is the same factory that supplies the real Kalashnikovs to the Russian Army.  The gun alone cost $1000 new and that was more than 3 years ago.  It is not a cheap piece of worn-out junk.  More pics available upon request.
