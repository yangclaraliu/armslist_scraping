Mossberg International’s new lightweight Tactical .22 combines the look and feel of today’s AR-style platforms with Mossberg International’s reliable and affordable .22 autoloader.

The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13” length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4” – 14.5” LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights.

Here is a very rare version of a muzzleloader.  Note that it gives you the best of both worlds.  

You have the over all layout of a more modern gun... Including a recoil pad.  It is built more like a modern gun, feels more like a modern gun.  But!!! 

It is a muzzleloading sidelock rifle.  It will get you on the black powder season for deer in every state that has one!  

As you know some states allow you to use only a muzzle loader with a sidelock and a percussion cap.  Other... if it muzzle loads, it is cool! 

This one is cool everywhere black powder is cool.  And with the modern recoil pad arrangement, it won't break your shoulder when you pull the trigger.  

It is a nice bargain of a gun."

1. Colt series 70 1911 govt. with Night sights--->900.00
this is a 1979 produced colt. It is totally stock except for the fusion firearms installed 3 dot tritium sights (the stock sights are very difficult to use practically, these sights are staked ledge night sights installed by a gunsmith. the gun will alsocome with an Ed brown drop in solid bushing and an arched mainspring housing.y low round count, less than a 1000 rounds through it
Ver the finish is blues but has a really nice worn patina to it.There is absolutely no rust however there is the infamous idiot mark (not my doing) as well as some other minor dings in the frame. Comes with orig plastic wood diamond grips and hogue rubber wrap arounds.

2. Smith and Wesson Model 60 Pro. leather custom holster and speedloaders      included--->675.00

3in barreled pro series .38/.357 with front stock night sight. this gun has less than 300 flawless rounds through it. no dings dents or scratches. I have very carefully added green testors to the top of the sight to make target acquisition quicker, its easily removed with solvent. comes with stock wood grips and hogue wrap around rubber grips which makes shooting 357 out of this enjoyable and .38 seems like .22 Mag... Also included is a really nice sourdough silver dollar pancake holster with IWB loops. also
including a safariland comp2 loader and 2 bianchi speed strips
Oh and one last thing: the goofy ILS system has been professionally disabled. the post was ground off and all parts reinstalled by a gunsmith.

We never fired it, she just likes the balance of the 4"". This is the posting from the gentleman I bought it from:

I have for sale a unique blued S&W 65-5 .357 3"" barrel. It's a heavy barrel with Walnut boot grips with S&W medallions. No internal lock. Made in the early '90s. Sorry, no box or papers.

Before I get multiple emails again trying to school me that S&W never made a blued 65, allow me to explain.

You are all correct. Smith never made a blued 65; it was the model 13. I am a big Smith collector and own many S&W's, including multiple 3"" models (not boasting, just how it is). I wanted a 3"" model 13, but couldn't find one for the longest time. After speaking with a master gun restorer, he mentioned that there is a new ""hot bluing"" process designed for stainless. To his knowledge, or mine, we have never seen or heard of a blued stainless gun, but I was curious. Keep in mind, when I called S&W about this, they said that was impossible, and couldn't be done (this is why S&W didn't blue it!). So, I purchased another 65 and took it to my guy to see if this would work. The gun you see before you is the result. It turned out beautiful. Only three things wouldn't blue: the trigger, hammer, and case ejector. Now this gun is the best of both worlds, a 3"" revolver that is blued, but corrosion resistant due to the stainless. Also, worth noting, this process isn't permanent. By that I mean the bluing can be removed, and you have a stainless gun back. I installed a new pair of Altamont boot grips on it, and added it to the collection. I hope everyone is now satisfied.

So, with that being said, I'm looking for $650 firm. If the ad is still up, gun is still available. Thank you,"

There is something wrong with the stock when you fire it the spring knocks the stock back a little bit which makes the bolt stick. I brought it to a gun smith an they told me it needs a new stock. Really its not worth my time i have other projects that I can just use the money of selling this as it to someone for cheap then trying to fix it then sell it for more.

Im firm at $175, it comes with three 20 round pre ban mags, and two boxs of 20 rounds each so 40 rounds of 308(762x51)

The barrel is 20"". It is chambered for 2 3/4"" shells. Based on its serial number it was manufactured in 1973. It has rifle sights with the orange triangle front blade.

This shotgun was sold to us in a rust covered state, but the bore was bright. We have bead-blasted and reblued the shotgun. You can see the extensive pitting that is in the metal under the bluing in the photos. There are dings and scratches on the wood as you can see in the photos, the worst being on the right side of the stock. The shotgun has been drilled and tapped for a scope rail at some point. The bore is bright and the shotgun is fully functional.

If you want a Deerslayer to actually slay deer with, this is your gun. If you want a collectible shotgun with original bluing and safe-queen levels of wear, this is not your gun.

SIG Sauer German. 40 Cal Smith and Wesson semi auto pistol. It's excellent condition with less than 500 rounds fired. One of the sweetest trigger double and single action pulls I've seen on a factory pistol. Its never jammed and is quite accurate. It comes w 3 12 round cap factory mags and 1 10 cap magazine, factory case, manual. 1 box of 50 target ammo and the 3 12 round mags are loaded with Winchester Ranger hollow point self defense loads. It comes with a left handed inside the waist band leather holster. This is the same model that many us military and law enforcement agencies carry. Its a mid 90s model. If you know SIGs you know the older models are sought after as new production offerings have been known to have quality control issues, thanks to CEO Cohen emphasizing cosmetics over craftsmanship. New they go for $850. I'll accept $650 for everything to first responsible person who can legally own as handgun."

Not really sure if I want to get rid of this rifle. It is in beautiful condition practically brand new. Only 80 rounds put thru it. The thing I love about this rifle is that they gave you a socket and socket wrench and if you wanna switch out the barrel instead of taking the whole upper receiver off and switching it with another one with a different barrel on it like you would have to do to any other Ar15, LMT started making it so you can just loosen the two bolts and the slid the one barrel out and then slid what ever new barrel back in to do a quick change  on barrels.

Um im open to trade or cash not really sure what id be looking to get since i wasnt really on planing to get rid of this one but if i cant sell or trade my Bushmaster P.M.R 18 custom shop 2 then Ill have to try to get rid of this one.

I really would like an M1A and cash, but im open to all fire arm trades or equal or less value. (for fire arms worth less I would like to get cash throw in on top of your rifle or what ever you have for trade)

1960's manufacture Ishapore enfield 2A1 chambered in 7.62x51 but handles .308 hunting loads just fine. It is in a monte carlo style synthetic stock and has 12 round detachable magazine. Rifle was finished with a duracoat when I bought it and still has a good finish. Bolt, receiver and magazine have been polished. This rifle functions flawlessly and the iron sights are a real pleasure to shoot with. This is not a junky truck gun, as you can empty the magazine in 10 seconds or less with accuracy well beyond 200 yards. Also, being chambered in 7.62x51, I've fired many different rounds up to match ammo with amazing results. You won't disappointed at this price. It would make a great 6 pound deer rifle."

This mag is in great shape. Some you see have surface rust and are beat up,dented,rusted, beat to shit. This one besides normal wear most likely from floating around for decades looks better than that. No dings or dents and still has the grease they used to protect this mag inside you can see.
The spring works perfect and this mag will work perfect for you. I loaded 50-9mm rounds in it and it works like it should. I do not even know if this magazine was ever used besides me loading rounds into it.

I was reading that some people are buying these to use them on gun/parts kits made to fit this mag so they can have a 50-rounder. 

45 Caliber Hollow points also fit into this magazine so if you can make your gun chamber 45's- you can have a 50-rd. 45 caliber clip that shoots the fatter 45-caliber shorter hollow points.
