The Audi A4 is one of the better cars in a crowd of smaller sport-luxury sedans that, dollar-for-dollar, offers some of the best, most appealing vehicles in the world.

The A4 line is complex, with 21 variants. The key is thinking according to priorities: body style, engine size, front wheel drive, transmission type. All are nicely balanced, enjoyable automobiles.

The A4 2.0T turbocharged, 200-hp four-cylinder is one of the better small engines going, with satisfying response and spry acceleration, particularly with the standard six-speed automatic transmission. It corners like a sports sedan, and high-quality construction is evident inside and out.
Every A4 should appeal to techies. State-of-the-art engines feature direct fuel injection: the cleanest, most efficient means yet devised to blend gasoline and air in an engine's cylinders. The 6-speed automatic transmission delivers truly seamless shifting. Sophisticated suspension technology is augmented with electronic stability control, which can help the driver avoid a crash. The A4 is stuffed with safety features and offers rear side-impact airbags, while most cars in its class don't.

Unlike other tech-heavy cars, the gizmos blend nicely in the A4, enhancing comfort, convenience and safety, and improving the driving experience.

The A4 can be pricey and it's relatively small. On the other hand, you'll have to look long and hard to find a car that blends driving satisfaction, safety, convenience, practicality, great finish and reasonable ownership cost as well as the A4.

The A4 2.0T turbocharged, 200-hp four-cylinder is one of the better small engines going, with satisfying response and spry acceleration, particularly with the standard six-speed automatic transmission. It corners like a sports sedan, and high-quality construction is evident inside and out.
Every A4 should appeal to techies. State-of-the-art engines feature direct fuel injection: the cleanest, most efficient means yet devised to blend gasoline and air in an engine's cylinders. The 6-speed automatic transmission delivers truly seamless shifting. Sophisticated suspension technology is augmented with electronic stability control, which can help the driver avoid a crash. The A4 is stuffed with safety features and offers rear side-impact airbags, while most cars in its class don't.

Unlike other tech-heavy cars, the gizmos blend nicely in the A4, enhancing comfort, convenience and safety, and improving the driving experience.

The A4 can be pricey and it's relatively small. On the other hand, you'll have to look long and hard to find a car that blends driving satisfaction, safety, convenience, practicality, great finish and reasonable ownership cost as well as the A4.

Releasable Armor Carrier TTRAC Coyote Brown
Part Number: 22004-14
Retail: $307.75 (without armor plates)
Manufacturers Description:
Tactical Tailor is proud to introduce the Tactical Tailor Releasable Armor Carrier (TTRAC). Manufactured from 1000 denier Cordura Nylon, the TTRAC will accommodate SAPI plates up to size XL (11""x14"") as well as spall armor. The adjustable cummerbund has separate integrated pockets designed for military issue side SAPI plates (6""x7""). A center pull release system allows the wearer to easily release the vest using either hand and we have engineered it to be almost as easy to reassemble as it is to release. PLEASE NOTE: The TTRAC is designed to carry hard plates. It is not designed to hold BALCS style soft armor. The TTRAC features modular webbing on most of its surface which provides the user with nearly unlimited options for placement of MOLLE/PALS style equipment to meet almost any mission requirement and is fully adjustable to fit most wearers. Also features a reinforced drag handle.


The armor plates are size LARGE and have ""7.62 mm APM2 Protection U.S."" printed on the inside & ""Size Large Strike Face Handle With Care"" printed on the outside. (see pictures)"

The bad:
4X4 vacuum is clogged and needs to be blown out with an air compressor. I guess the original owner disconnected the line and left it half on while she drove and it got filled up with dirt. If you have an air compressor it will be an easy fix, just blow out the dirt on this little vacuum line.
It needs to have the alignment fixed. It wiggles really bad at about 40-50 mph, so as long as you keep it in city speeds you don't notice it. You wheelers out there know what I am talking about. It happens all the time and is cheap to fix. If I could afford to keep this rig I would love to; tuition is not cheap though.

If I wasn't on the mediocre disability income I'm dependent upon, I'd buy her a nice light S&W snubbie, but in these circumstances I'm hoping that someone with a gun like the Taurus 85/Protector series will be willing to part with it for under $300 or so. I've cautioned my mom that this isn't an area to skimp so there's a bit of wiggle room.

At her age and reduced use and strength of her hands, I think something in the sub-17oz. weight, shooting standard .38 special (I don't think she'd do well with .38 +P much less .357 magnum loads), either JHP or Glasers, with a shrouded or even bobbed hammer to avoid snags will fill the bill.

Like me, she can't manipulate a semiauto's slide so it's definitely a revolver I'm looking for.

I hope we get this issue resolved soon, I don't like the idea of her going unarmed these days. If I weren't disabled and wheelchair bound I'd be happy to go with her when she goes out but right now that's just not going to happen."

I got this trailer last year around April or May in Arkansas off the show room floor and i paid $2400.00 for it and only used to haul my two four wheelers back and fourth a few times to Lake Keystone and has been garage left when im not using it. Has never spent a night outside. The lumber is treated lumber and is in brand new shape. This is a great looking and pulling trailer.

Im asking $1800.00 O.B.O. so let me know what you want to offer and all i can say is no. 

I need some money. Got a kid on the way so im trying to sell off some things before he comes.

Bought this from a guy who needed to make a car payment a few months ago. It had a blue 7MM Mag barrel on it. Not being a magnum fan, I sold the barrel and bought 2 new stainless barrels for it.

The round count on both barrels is under 30. Both barrels shot sub MOA groups with premium factory ammo.

The Zeiss MC scopes are not included in the price but can be bought separately. One is a 3x9x40 Conquest $400 The other is a 4.5x14x50 side focus, $650.00.

Frame with barrel of your choice $550, with both barrels $750.00. Scope mounts stay on barrels.

From Trijicon's website:


TA01NSN-TRD: 4x32 Trijicon ACOG® with 8.0 MOA
The TA01NSN-TRD combines the technology of the battle-tested Trijicon ACOG (4x32) gun sight with the Trijicon RedDot™ 8.0 MOA red dot sight. This provides the shooter with the option of quick acquisition close range sighting with the RedDot™ sight and the precision for longer range shooting with the Trijicon ACOG 4x32. This ability to adjust to tactical situations gives the user the needed edge when the lives are on the line and success is the only acceptable outcome. The ranging reticle allows for bullet drop compensation out to 600 meters without any manual adjustments. The reticle will appear black during the daytime and will glow amber in the dark, thanks to Trijicon’s patented tritium illumination."

This is a true 1000 yard rifle. The gun is like new with only 10 shots through it. There are no nicks or scratches and the gun is beautiful. It does have a very nice wood bench rest stock. Here are some particulars about the gun:

Ruger® M77® Mark II Target rifles are time-tested, bolt-action, special-application rifles at a great value. These rifles feature a matte stainless steel finish that resists corrosion. The heavy contour, hammer-forged barrel with target crown provides long-range accuracy shot after shot. The wide, target forend gives stability on sandbags or other support surfaces. Its greatest value comes from the features that have defined the M77 Mark II family of rifles for the last 20 years.

With a one-piece bolt that has proven to be one of the strongest on the market, integral scope bases which can never shoot loose, and a diagonally angled forend screw that adds accuracy by securely pulling the barreled action down into the handsome, black laminate stock for accurate shooting, the M77 Mark II Target rifle proves its value as a workhorse in the field and at the range.  Sorry no trades on this one."

With the Galco holster I put the value on this at around $875."

An opportunity to restore one of these rare guns, of the Civil War, from a very historical arsenal which is a tourist attraction today. Harper's Ferry was fought over and taken by both sides many times. Before that, John Brown captured it to ignite the Civil War and free the slaves...which he accomplished at the cost of his life and reputation. Patriot, or zealot? We can use a man like that again...to free us all, I think. Nice smooth patina on all metal surfaces, sound walnut stock, good original nipple, all original, ship weight is 12 pounds.

This is a Hungarian AMD 65 AK. It works amazing, and is incredibly accurate for an AK. I hit all around the bull's eye at 100 yards with this thing while standing, no problem.

Its now painted flat black, so it looks even better and cooler than it does in the video and check out the pictures.

This AK is much better than those Century AK's and is more like an Arsenal, its probably somewhere right between as far as accuracy, quality, and sites. The sites are incredibly straight, and it will dance around the bull's eye all day long at 100 yards.

NOTES: US made barrel, Nodak Spud receiver, Tapco G2 trigger set, Tapco gas piston.

Just watch the video and you'll see for yourself: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omnBGD59Ww0

Also, you'll see us goofin' off and shooting my M4 and R700 as well, in the primary, all day long, slaying bodies. Good to go?

Enjoy the video, and I hope you like what you see with the AK, its a bad little side folder, which also works great for HOME Defense, as its perfect for clearing your home. I knew of someone who killed an armed robbery and intruder in his house with one very similar to this, and he said the side folder really helped him clear his home, and also the firepower stopping power of the AK and its 30 round mag.

I really hate to sell this, as I love it so much, but I just really need the money right now.

Price is negotiable, throw offers out there, and we can discuss what to do about FTF transfer, if out of state (I'm in Georgia), and I'll ship to your FFL, and we can work out who pays shipping depending on what you're offering to pay.

I'll work with you. Gotta take care of ya'll.

Also, if you know anybody that is looking for an AK, or just loves buying tons of guns, send the link to them, and let them watch the video and see the pictures.

I appreciate your help if you help me sell this rifle soon, because I need the money."

This is an almost new Remington Versa Max with the 28"" barrel with the black synthetic stock. I've only shot four shells through it. It shows no signs of wear.

I bought it because I've been wanting a Benelli Cordoba, but then I saw that this shoots 3 1/2"" shells so I had to buy it. Though the action is very similar, I think i'm just partial to the Benelli.

It comes with the original case, paperwork, 5 chokes, gun lock, adjustable LOP's, etc.

I really want a Benelli Cordoba or Benelli M4 for a trade, preferably 12 gauge in black. I'd also consider a Beretta A400 Xplor, etc. I'm also looking for long range .308 AR's (LWRC REPR's, heavy barreled FN SCAR, Bushmaster ACR), I like FN five-sevens, fnx-45 tacticals, HK guns, 1911's, over-under shotguns, auto-loading .410's, nicer rifles, etc...

This gun was given to me by my uncle.  I really don't have a use for it.  I thought about cutting down the barrel to make it a home defense gun, but I couldn't do it to something this old.  The machining is beautiful and not like most firearms made today.  

I am unsure of the choke on the barrel, but the barrel length is 28"".  I can measure the bore on the muzzle if anyone would like.  

It shoots well.  I haven't hunted with it, but shot trap a couple times and it functioned well."
