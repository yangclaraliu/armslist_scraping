If you are not familiar with Ruger's AR-15, read the reviews. Ruger use a “Two Stage Piston Drive” wherein the gas energy drives a piston, which in turn cycles the bolt. According to Ruger, ""The Piston Drive system minimizes combustion residue in the action, proving a cooler, cleaner, and more reliably running rifle.” 

For Tennessee residents, a bill of sale will be required so you must have a drivers license or CWL. Out of state transactions will be completed at my local gun shop and the dealer will ship the rifle to a FFL holder in your state. The cost for all out-of-state paperwork, shipping, insurance, etc. will be the buyer's responsibility. Sale price is firm."

Caliber:   .300 Blackout

Barrel Length:  16""

Color:  Black

Sights: None

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize in standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, v5-300 AAC Blackout Complete Upper Receiver Group comes in two different configurations no sights or fixed front/rear sights.

The 300 BlackOut is designed to be shot suppressed and un-surpressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions.  The testing of the Daniel Defense 300 BlackOut firearms indicates that un-surpressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend.  Although, though our extensive testing we did ascertain that the utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-surpressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.

I am NOT A DEALER , I do run a business, but DO NOT SELL GUNS for a living or have anything to do with weaponry as my business , it is my personal hobby.
What is wrong with this setup? lol WHAT ISN'T?  but it how I roll. actually it is a few things, but most got it with the bipod mounted on gas block and scope touching the rail. I like my pod on backwards as folded it serves as a hand rest with the forward grip.

Watching AR 15 prices on this site is getting comical, common now lets not start a market increase in prices on junk parts, like a AR15 lower with unknown upper for 2300? A Danial for 4k? ahahah guy the lower is only 79.00 plus tax and 15.00 transfer at AIMSPORTS when they are in stock.. and this is their first batch.   Lets not give into what the government and corporations want...

With people asking for 5k for a sig and 2k for a 900 bushmaster ,4200 for a Danial  my ar should be worth just as much :) lol.. sigh

When you fire this gun it's immediately obvious you're not behind a normal AR-15 in 5.56. It's got a kick to let you know there's a 50 cal bullet headed downrange. It is manageable though and is similar to shooting an auto 20g shotgun or maybe even lighter than that. This one was test fired by the builder and is an absolute blast to shoot. It runs like a typewriter and is incredibly reliable. 

Several of these rifles have been sent to our troops in the middle east to test at Check-Points. If a vehicle refuses to stop they fire one of these giant bullets from their modified AR to instantly seize the motor and stop the vehicle.

50 Cals are on the chopping block for gun control ban legislation so they may not be available much longer."

I bought this gun from Money Mizer in Phenix City Alabama last week. The cost below is what I have in the gun. I am not trying to take advantage of the current situation. I debated long and hard between this particiular gun and the Mossberg MVP and went with this. This is not exactly what I am looking for. I have shot it 30 times 3 full mags.
It shoots really well but I am having a hard time convincing myself that I need or want an automatic when I am so used to a Bolt Action.
I have the recipt for the gun and will show to someone if they are serious about buying it. The gun comes as a package deal and I am not interested in selling it any different way.
Scope is a Simmons Whitetail Classic 6.5x20x50 Purchased and installed on Wednesday of this week.

I live in Smiths Station and can meet you if interested.

1350.00 FIRM CASH ONLY. I am not in need of money or in need of any help selling. Please dont contact me and ask me to sell only the gun because as stated before this is a package deal. I have the box for the gun and the box for the scope. Like I said before this gun was purchased last week.

Will sell to a resident of Alabama only so please be prepared to show ID at time of Transaction.

Only Trade I would be interested in is a Brand New Mossberg MVP with Heavy Barrell.

There's the 42"" hand-tooled saddle tan belt, it's double thick, about 1/4' thick, with 7 adjustment holes - has 6 (six) bullet loops.   It's my understanding from the Mernickle website you measure 1 1/2 to 2"" below where your pants belt sits and that's a good measurement for wearing the gun belt on the hip.  the holster that can go with it is either of the two in the next paragraph.  This belt plus one holster goes for $260 on Mernickleholsters.com plus shipping, so it's $225 firm from me.  And with the additional holster originally priced at $120, then this double gun holster + belt rig goes for a total of $380 plus shipping online - if you want the double holster it's $325 from me.

As to the holsters - they are Brand NEW Mernickle Cowboy Action hand tooled, saddle tan to match the belt, doubl- thick holsters, one is for 6 1/2"" barrel (or shorter) 357/38 Ruger Single Action (Blackhawk, Vaquero, etc) and the other is for the 5 1/2"" (or shorter) 357/38 Ruger Single Action (Blackhawk, Vaquero, etc).  I believe they'll fit other western style pistols, so we'd have to give them a try for your particular setup.  So if both holsters don't go with the rig as above, the one that's left is $100.

And finally, there is a NEW 6-round 357/38 ""carrier"", it has screws & backing nuts that make it sorta clasp around and fit securely to the belt, without scraping up the belt or cutting thru it. These go for $40, looking for $30.

Flintlock for sale. The Renegade is the no frills, no brass (grey steel furniture) version of the T/C Hawken, made in the 80s and 90s. The gun is 43"" long and has a 27"" barrel with 1:48 twist. I am selling it because I found an unshot one on GunBroker that had spent a lot of years in a closet, and its a good compact gun for deer hunting.

This is not a new or beautiful gun, and some of the miles show, but it shoots fine. It is a hunter vs. a show it off gun! There is minor surface rust on the outside of the barrel. I was planning to naturally brown it, but I have no time free to do it!

I replaced the frizzen about a month ago, and had the old man at Dixons check the lock assembly. I shot it last weekend to make sure I could still hit something before second season. It shoots well with a .015 lubed patch for ball.

I have shot 175 gr. ball (65 gr. FFg), Hornady 240 gr. PA conicals (80 gr. FFg), and Hornady 285 gr. Plains Bullets (85 gr. FFg) through it. At 75 yds. They all will produce a 4"" grouping with those powder loads (with a steady eye).. 

It will also shoot FFFg, if you back off the volume by 15%, and though T/C says you can shoot sabots in the Hawken and Renegade, I dont like the performance!

I will include for the Buyer a dozen 175 gr. ball and a stack of lubed and unlubed patches, and a dozen of the PA conicals. There is also an extra flint and leather and a cleaning jag in a flat tin to store it all. All you need is the powder and prime!

I can meet anywhere within 20 miles of the I-81/I-83 intersection.

If you email, leave a number, and I will call you back as soon as I can. Email is on the Droid, so it will be soon after!"

Every ammo website has been constantly putting more ammo on their sites multiple times a day for half the price of what people try to charge on here for stuff that has been sitting in their closet loosely packed for years. Talked to Promag company, they're working 24/7 with two shifts of people to pump out as many mags as they can. All these shooting supply stores have had their ammo stocked up for years and years and had thousands of pmags in the back, then everyone freaks out and buys every single thing the stores have, then these ammo and mag companies have to restock THE WHOLE COUNTRY at once in just a few days, so people freak and think its gone for good just bc the stores can't restock immediately. Congress is out for Christmas, even if every person in Congress agreed we should pass laws banning bulk ammo and high cap mags, it would take over a month just to pass it. Ammo companies and mag companies will fill our orders in that time (I promise you, they want to fill our orders just as bad as we want it). What people forget is we have tons of reps in congress which do not support gun control laws. Lastly, why the hell do people think the assault weapons are going anywhere? Obama could never pass that because pressure from all the huge gun manufactures and NRA. SURE, he might pass a ban on 30 round mags and certain collapsable stocks, but the guns themselves aren't going anywhere. Sources- Brother works for NRA, Grandfather owns an outdoors store."

It has a 32-1/2"" barrel with a 1:60 twist, and an overall length of 49-1/2"". It has a double set trigger. This rifle is the closest reproduction of the true Hawken Bros. rifle of St. Louis fame. It is just too much rifle for my means, and only gets shot once or twice a year at a friends house with the Blackpowder locals! I prefer a shorter rifle, because of the laurels and thickets I hunt in,and I have an unfired T/C Renegade due in by UPS Monday! And hopefully this will be in someones hands for the second season!

I put new wedges in a couple of weeks ago. I shot it last weekend, and it is ready to go. The rifle is designed for, and shoots FFFg powder, which is a bit faster ignition, and of which I will include a half a can of with the rifle. I have shot 175 gr. round ball with a .018 lubed patch, 240 gr. PA conicals, and the true deerslayer for a Lyman GPR or other 50 cal. longrifle, the 285 gr. Great Plains Bullet. I will put those up against a T/C Maxiball or Maxihunter anytime in the GPR. The Plains Bullet was designed for the 1:60 and 1:66 twist of a longrifle. And by personal experience, I can testify... it will knock over a mature doe in her tracks at 80 yards! No trailing necessary!

As a part of the package, I am cleaning out the ML box, and will include a dozen .490 ball, cleaning and lubed patches, a dozen PA conicals, and yes, a half-dozen Plains bullets. So, for $400.00, you get the following;

-The 50 cal. Lyman Great Plains Rifle, with a jag on the ramrod. 
-A dozen .490 round ball
 -Stack of dry and lubed patches
 -2 extra Agate Flints and a strip of leather
 -A dozen 240 gr. PA Conicals
 -A half-dozen Great Plains bullets
 -A steel tin to store it all in a hunting coat pocket
 -As an added bonus, I fancy myself an amateur tinkerer, so I will also provide a small homemade deer horn pan primer on a leather lanyard with @8-10 charges of FFFFg in it for the pan!
 -A wish of good hunting, since this package allows for nothing else to hunt, except a steady eye!

Windham weaponry is the former bushmaster company before Remington bought them out. They signed and agreement not to make weapons for 5 years. It is the original bushmaster staff after Remington fired them all. This is a better, tighter AR15 than the bushmaster and this is MILSPEC (which is a grey area anyway) except for the buffer, its commercial. Google the reviews of this weapon. No complaints. Also not available anywhere. This is a new, never fired, still in box gun. It comes with a hard case and 30 round mag. Lifetime transferable warranty

Never buy a gun for someone who is unwilling or unable to do so.

Most sellers are requiring a valid ccw to buy a weapon, which is close as you can get to a background check for a person. I agree that people are charging high prices but please don't confuse this with a straw purchase...."
