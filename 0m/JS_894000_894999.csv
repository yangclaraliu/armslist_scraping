The headstamp on the cartridges is L C. The pic shows the only information available on the can -- you can see it says ""linked"" but that has been spray painted over, and obviously it's not linked, and it does not appear to be de-linked (ie not dented) ammo. The ammo all appears to be clean and shiny in good shape. Good brass, non-corrosive, reloadable.
I didn't dump it out or count it, but with the foam that is inside the top of the can to keep the ammo tight I'm sure it's the full 250 count.  See the price or make an offer.  Cash only, not interested in any trades."

The HR3C magazines store 20 additional rounds in the magazine that can be input via a stripper clip to where reloading is done in a matter of seconds. No more sore fingers from loading the magazines (at least with these, not so much with the factory or Eagle mag). The Eagle magazine is an older one that doesn't have the problems the newer ones have. The factory magazine is great too. It really follows the lines of the rifle and is good for when you are hunting and don't want a banana magazine sticking out. 

All in all, this is a great rifle and good deal. I would not hesistate to buy this rifle and magazines to introduce new shooters to the sport or for someone looking to do some plinking / hunting. With this being an older 10/22 (better quality components), stainless, the value of the magazines and the red dot I feel $500 is a fair price for this rifle. Sure, you can get a lesser 10/22 cheaper, but you will be getting a blued barrel and plastic components."

This is a two tapper and it holds a full size keg and 6 barrel at the same time. I put it in my man cave a year ago. 

What I did was take a good top mount 20 cubic feet stainless whirlpool fridge and use the bottom for two kegs and the top for freezing mugs. I got the specific whirlpool model from Lowes because the fridge is capable of reaching 32 degrees. I learned from a friend that used a cheaper fridge that would only get to 36. I like mine cold as possible. The top mount freezer was an unforeseen bonus for freezing 40 ounce mugs.

Comes with everything needed to get the beer flowing; Fridge, Kegs (full size and 6 barrel), CO2 container, 2 taps, tap cleaning supplies, all connections and hoses, even the frozen mugs in the freezer. Everything in the photo except the Bud beer tap handle, it was a gift. I’ll replace it with a Boulevard Wheat one.

I have $1600 invested but don’t know if it will return that. So how about what I have in the fridge $1000 and call the extras are free.

This is great for the man cave and any beer drinker. I saved a ton of money instead of buying cases for the poker and pool parties."

   With the passage of Gov. Cuomo's unconstitutional assault weapons ban and requirement for ""assault weapon"" registration, your state's tyrants have set the playing field for the disarmament of America. I encourage you to NOT comply, do NOT sell your now illegal firearms and magazines, do NOT register them. DRAW THE LINE IN THE SAND. You need AR's and AK's, high cap mags and ammo flooding into the state. You now have the power to show the democrats that their little pipe dream of walking into you're home and taking your guns isn't going to work. Urge your friends and family in law enforcement to not comply or enforce these unconstitutional laws. It's time to nut up or shut up, stand your ground and do not be afraid to fight for freedom. Complete confiscation is the end game.

http://www.colt.com/ColtLawEnforcement/Products/ColtAdvancedLawEnforcementCarbine.aspx.
It has the new Colt AR 30 round mags, never used (I used old 20's when I took it out).  I shot about 50-75 rounds, slow fire, off of bench, determining what ammo I wanted to shoot.  It preferred the superformance 77 grain load, shooting it at well under 1/2 MOA, but even the bulk 55 grain fmj ammo shot about 1.5"" for five shots at 100.
$2450 for the rifle with all mags/accessories that came with it new.  Presently the rifle has a RRA match trigger in it.  I can either sell the rifle with that for $150 more ($2600), or put the Colt trigger back in it.  I also have 10 of the window style 30 round P-mags, and five non-window 30 round P-mags available.  I will consider trades for other guns, otherwise, cash only.  I will ship within Montana at Buyer's cost, but prefer face to face sale."

 Ruger sling (not shown in pictures)

I've never had a problem out of the rifle or magazines. It's in great shape and you must see it to truly appreciate the rifle. The high capacity magazines are a lot of fun. The HR3C magazines store 20 additional rounds in the magazine that can be input via a stripper clip to where reloading is done in a matter of seconds. No more sore fingers from loading the magazines (at least with these, not so much with the factory or Eagle mag). The Eagle magazine is an older one that doesn't have the problems the newer ones have. The factory magazine is great too. It really follows the lines of the rifle and is good for when you are hunting and don't want a banana magazine sticking out. 

All in all, this is a great rifle and good deal. I would not hesistate to buy this rifle and magazines to introduce new shooters to the sport or for someone looking to do some plinking / hunting. With this being an older 10/22 (better quality components), stainless, the value of the magazines and the red dot I feel it should bring more than a standard Wal-Mart 10/22. Sure, you can get a lesser 10/22 cheaper, but you will be getting a blued barrel and plastic components."

I've never had a problem out of the rifle or magazines. It's in great shape and you must see it to truly appreciate the rifle. The high capacity magazines are a lot of fun. The HR3C magazines store 20 additional rounds in the magazine that can be input via a stripper clip to where reloading is done in a matter of seconds. No more sore fingers from loading the magazines (at least with these, not so much with the factory or Eagle mag). The Eagle magazine is an older one that doesn't have the problems the newer ones have. The factory magazine is great too. It really follows the lines of the rifle and is good for when you are hunting and don't want a banana magazine sticking out. 

All in all, this is a great rifle and good deal. I would not hesistate to buy this rifle and magazines to introduce new shooters to the sport or for someone looking to do some plinking / hunting. With this being an older 10/22 (better quality components), stainless, the value of the magazines and the red dot I feel $500 is a fair price for this rifle. Sure, you can get a lesser 10/22 cheaper, but you will be getting a blued barrel and plastic components."

It is in very good condition with just normal operating markings.  The stock is in great shape with the serial number stamped in it that matches the receiver.  Has absolutely no problems and fires well with no jams or ejection problems.

Recently had the bolt worked on so it does NOT have the pesky ""sticky firing pin"". (aka You don't have to worry about slam fires) The firing pin moves freely in the bolt.

Comes with the rifle, hard case, 4 metal 10-round stripper clips, 53 rounds of 7.62x39, and a UTG Tactical Profile Picatinny Mount (Replaces the back of the receiver so you can mount a scope on it if you so choose. Take about 30 seconds to switch from the original to this railed rear.) and the Mount comes with 1"" scope rings.

This Stainless Steel and Titanium Taurus Ultralite is in near mint condition. It is .38 Special but rated to shoot +P and +P+ loads. I have not tried shooting any +P+ as it does a fantastic job of making the palm of my hand sore after a box of +P personal defense ammo. I have put less than 100 rounds through it. It is so light and concealable that I often forgot I was even carrying!

The Mariner®, with Mossberg''s exclusive Marinecote™ finish , is ideal for hostile weather environments, coastal environments, boat patrol, etc. The Mariner is the ideal choice when a vehicular-mounted shotgun is subjected to all-season climates, which can induce condensation on weapons. Rigorous testing proves the Marinecote resists corrosion better than stainless steel. This finish is harder than ordinary gunmetal and provides the added bonus of greater resistance to wear and distinctly smoother action.

I know my rifles and I know market value, and yes this is a high trade value because most of the rifles are inflated $300-$500, so we can do it this way, or we can come down to realistic numbers, let me know. AR prices are slowly coming down."

Rubber cheek weld attached to folding stock (removable).  UTG quad rail with scope mount installed, quad rail covers included.  Original foregrip included (not shown in pictures).  Bipod stud mounted in quad rail.  Folding forward pistol grip with storage compartment.  Bayonet lug.  Flip up night sights present, but no glow left in tritium tubes.  A new Israeli extractor and extractor spring were installed after purchase.  The serial number starts with GAL and the ejector lug and receiver looks great.  There have been between 350 and 500 rounds fired through the rifle since I purchased it new.  Bore is in fantastic shape.
This rifle is a combination of an AR-15 and an AK-47.  The receiver is milled and the folding stock is very solid and locks up tight, made from steel tubing and a cast aluminum butt section.  This rifle has a gas piston and a right side charging handle, that can be charged with the left hand also as it is vertically oriented.  The rifle is much more accurate than the typical AK-47 type design.  The front sight hood is a full circle, so it is easy to line up with the ar style flip 2 size peep rear sights.  There are flip up night sights but the tritium does not glow, the tritium tubes can be replaced if you search online.  
The magazines are all in very good shape and are metal, not plastic.  There are (12) 35 round magazines.  There are (5) 12 round magazines-purchased new (unused).
Face to face, no felons.  21 or older.  Will want to see a CCW or CO drivers license (just name and photo).  Will want a receipt for both parties.  Cash only.  Local sale only, will not ship.

The Winchester 190 is a tube-fed rifle with a smooth semi-automatic operation. The rifle's manufacture began in 1967 and continued until 1980, providing shooters with a no-frills plinker and varmint rifle that runs hassle-free and holds up to 15 rounds. This rifle features a  Bushnell Scope with a post front sight with an elevation-adjustable rear sight and a cross-bolt safety. Its wood, metal, and bore are all in good condition.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It 
has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. 

Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next 
month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will 
interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order: 

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do 
not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume 
you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am 
interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with 
where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons 
attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I 
contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, 
but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an 
agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the
 prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not 
interested in Shipping a gun anywhere but ike all things, If I get enough ridiculous 
offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear 
old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to 
your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal 
Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell 
through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit 
cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or 
anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay 
in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you 
are a litttle retarded and shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will 
email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do 
not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from 
work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am 
ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive 
across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. 
Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will 
have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I 
know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along 
with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous 
offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any 
response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable 
offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag 
the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are 
like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, 
they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers 
beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it. 

P.S. 

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts 
outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, 
ha."
