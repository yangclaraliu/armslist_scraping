Great Hi-Point carbine chambered in 9mm up for sale.  I have fired 150 rounds and it performed flawlessly!  Rapid fire didn't skip a beat!  It loved it!

Condition is near mint and I have attached a foregrip for what I felt was more ergonomic handling.  I really love this rifle, but 9mm just doesn't have enough balls.  I was impatient and didn't want to save for the right AK.  Honestly, now I have the money but don't want to spend it all so I'd rather absorb some of the cost by selling this.

I won't take less than $250 because I like it enough not to sell it and I don't need to sell it, but I'd rather shoot a bigger caliber/rifle round.

It took all 200 rds for the failure to ejects to clear up..then something broke in the trigger group after 85 rounds of problem free shooting. At which point  the gun would not function. Just got it back from Diamondback
They replaced the entire lower frame, trigger pin and extractor. I Don't plan on shooting it again as I am just disgusted with the firearm, company, and the money I have already invested..I bought it because it  received positive reviews online and supposedly was very dependable. Plus, it is the lightest and smallest 9mm in the world.  Honestly, after its trip to the Diamondback gunsmith it's probably fine( they replaced over 60% of the gun) and the paperwork says they put 18 rounds of Hornady critical defense through it, but like I said I'm just not impressed at all.. I know it t sounds like I'm not trying to sell it, lol. However I believe in being honest. You can try your luck at it for 300 maybe it will treat you better. Me? I am done with DB firearms I am going to double my money and buy the Sig 938. when it become available. Needless to say, THIS GUN IS BEING SOLD AS IS..."

I am selling a 7.62.54R Mosin Nagant Riffle. I have fully outfitted it with a carbon fiber, Monte Carlo Stock from Advanced technologies and added a scope mount with a 50mm, 9x magnification TASCO scope. I have sighted it in at 200 yards and have shot patterns of 6 in 1"" clusters at that range. Also, the scope mount will fit a host of different scopes. It is an excellent deer rifle. I am asking $450, being that I have put money into converting it. But the transformation is complete, and done well by and experienced gun smith in my area.  Other sellers are asking as much as $850 for their modified 7.62x54 R Mosin Nagant, with the same outfitting. I am asking half that at $425. Please email or call me know if you are interested. I am willing to negotiate a price. Thank you for your time. Attached are photos of the rifle. If you need more pics, feel free to email me.

I have a Russian Tokarev TT30 Military Pistol chambered in 7.62mm(.30cal). The pistol is marked 1935 and all numbers match down to the magazine. The original TT30 used a removeable section in the frame backstrap to mount the hammer spring, had the barrel lugs machined only 1/2 way around the barrel & used a slightly different hammer assembly. The 1st variant, mfg in 1934 had the lugs machined completely around the barrel, the 2nd variant, 1935 also changed the hammer assembly to the later TT33 type but still had the removeable backstrap plate. This pistol is the 2nd variant. These are HARD TO COME BY and I cannot find another one for sale online right now. Check out the pics for details about condition.

Brand New, never fired Pardner Pump Protector 12ga Pump Shotgun

Sitting in my closet as a good backup home defense shotgun. Already adequately and reasonably armed for defense, don't really need the Pardner. I can sell it or just keep it indefinitely, doesn't really matter either way these shotguns are dead reliable and very inexpensive. Just looking for whether or not there are people who might be interested to pick up one of these brand new from me, and save $30-50 as opposed to from a retail gun shop after tax out the door. Want $180 for it, and lower offers will be politely ignored. Also handgun trades of equal value considered, hi-points or heritage revolvers. Call or text [preferred] REDACTED. Need to see your Indiana driver's license, and inform me if you have a license to carry, even better."

I did some research online and found out this model is very accurate as nail-driver, super reliable and durable, all stainless steal, that's why this model used by L.A.P.D and police departments around the country. S&W don't make this model anymore, make it highly collectible for serious collectors and shooter, who wants the best. I cleaned and oiled the gun well, keep it in bag.

I bought this pistol new two weeks ago and have fired 200 rounds through it and cleaned thoroughly. Simple takedown and reassembly too. Its a sweet pistol, but after buying it I realized the slide mounted safety/decocker is too cumbersome for my small hands for use in IDPA competition. I guess Ill need to switch to a striker fire pistol. Everything will be as received new. All extras in Factory case. I have exactly $510 in this pistol and I hate to take a loss but will sell it for $460 . Shipping will be from my FFL to yours and all I ask is that you pay shipping costs. Pistol has been babied and never been in a holster. If youd like pics I will text as many as you like. PM me with trade offers or pic requests. Thanks alot!

This ordinance was passed by a 6 to 3 vote with council members Trudy Wade, Zack Matheny and Nancy Vaughan voting against the ban.

It is imperative that the Greensboro City Council hear your views on this matter!  Contact City Council members today and tell them their decision to ignore your right to self-defense based on an arbitrary definition is unacceptable, and that this ordinance should be amended to allow lawful concealed carry in ALL Parks- including ones with recreational facilities.

Number match. Includes holster, 2 magazines and cleaning tool. The blue finish show some light holster wear. The bore is nice and clean. The 9mm makarov ammo is inexpensive.

Has been modified with Wolff springs to reduce recoil, double action pull and mag release force. Recoil and double action pull are the two main complaints about this gun. A stronger recoil spring makes it much more comfortable to shoot. a weaker hammer spring reduces the force required for the double action pull and makes it much easier to release the magazine.

The small size and single stack mag makes this a very nice gun for concealed carry. Fits easily in a pocket and there are various holsters available.

This is a very nice gun and I'm not in a hurry to sell it. The price is pretty firm. Please don't send me your ridiculous low ball offers. Also, I don't need anyone telling me what they think this gun is worth."

All of these items are made for external applications only and will not interfere with the performance or internal components. The rail systems are all made of high grade aircraft aluminum. The stocks are made primarily for MILSPEC buffer tubes. The UBR and PRS stocks come with the proprietary mounting kit that is necessary for it to be installed correctly and safely.

The stock has some writing on the side that appears to have been down with a sharpy, I don't now why or what it means but it didn't bother me too much. I never tried to remove it. Its an older gun so its got nicks, scratches and worn spots in the bluing. There was even a little surface rust when I got it, that I touched up with some oxpho-blue. The rear action screw does not appear to be factory, it was this way when I got it. The Barrel has been shortened at some point, but it appears to have been done professionally as there was a recessed crown cut into it. The stock is bedded to the action and the gun shoots pretty good. I bought it as a ""brother in law gun"" to have as a loaner but I've never really needed it for that and its my 3rd 22-250 bolt action rifle.

Official Product Description:

Night Vision: ITT Night Quest 260 Generation III Binocular

ITT has been the world leader in night vision equipment development since their inception in 1959 and are now the sole supplier to the U.S. Military. Proven by U.S. and Allied Forces in Operation Desert Storm, ITT's Generation 3 night vision products are light years ahead of the surplus Russian equipment being pawned at army surplus stores. 404 precision engineered processes go into the assembly and manufacturing of each viewer. Several features set ITT's products apart from anything else on the market. These are: a state-of-the-art image intensifier tube with their unique MCP (microchannel plate) which contains over 6,000,000 microchannels. Each channel is 20 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Covering the microchannel plate is a thin protective film that's less than 100 atoms thick. The phosphor screen has a resolution 20 times higher than the typical television set, and all night vision products are sealed under clean-room conditions in such an ultra-high vacuum state that no other manufacturer can compare. The end result is clarity and resolution unmatched by others.
Night Quest 250/260

Compact, lightweight and weather resistant, the 250/260 binocular is a vital visual aid for peace of mind. These units were tested to rigid military specifications and were used in Desert Storm. Ideal for search and rescue, security and recreation, the Night Quest comes in both G2 and G3 Models. Superior clarity and resolution even in extremely low-light conditions allows the Model 250/260 to capture even the slightest speck of starlight to provide excellent night-time viewing. Ruggedly constructed, water resistant and lightweight (26 ounces), the Model 250/260 is easy to handle and has automatic gain control and electronic focus. The units feature F/1.4 optics and a 40° field of view. Runs on a 6V lithium camera battery.

I've had the gun for about 16 years give or take.  It has a tiny bit of surface rust on the top of the barrel where it meets the receiver and goes maybe 3"", it probably won't show up in the pictures but it's very minor and will likely disappear with a little steel wool, which I just don't have or I'd do it.

All you need to do is swap parts from action to action to swap calibers, no machining or gunsmith required. 7.62x45 being hard to find, an additional chambering in a common caliber makes this a great chance to use this fine weapon on a regular basis. 

This rifle AND barrel action are from the AYM factory, meaning it's less common then most VZ-52's

Overall condition of the rifle is very good as far as these rifles go, the stock is in surprisingly good shape. The only flaw is the fading in the bluing and a repair in the upper half of the stock over the barrel. The action is is decent shape and has more bluing then the one in the rifle.

Functions flawlessly and looks great. Comes with 4 or 5 milsurp alloy HK magazines (a couple function flawless, a couple do not). Does have a few handling marks, but nothing major. US made furniture.

Will trade for large bore revolvers, AR stuff (uppers, lowers) bolt action varmint guns, 10mm auto, etc. Cash price is $650, and I am willing to trade up or down. Will consider most all trades as long as they are similar real world value.
