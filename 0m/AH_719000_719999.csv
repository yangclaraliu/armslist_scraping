Included is 1 12-round mag and 2 10-round mags (ALL are HK, NO after market mags), as well as 20 rounds of hornady 230 grain +P hollow point ammo (HK pistols can fire +P ammo) The sights are the standard HK sights so it will fit in a holster no problem, unlike the raised sights.

This Rifle has a 20"" Green Mountain Sporter SS barrel at 125$
Leupold Weaver Rail, The receiver went under some modifications in order to mate the rail to the receiver so it is as solid as you can get on a 10/22.
Jard 1.5 lbs Trigger Group, 204$
Receiver was smoothed out on the inside a little to reduce friction then the Bolt has had some work. 
Took the Headspace down to .043"" within SAAMI Specifications. 
Firing pin protrusion is within spec as well at .035"". Firing pin is new and all burs were removed. 
The barrel has had around 300-500 rounds through it and isn't even close to seasoning. 
Has a Limb Saver on it. 
DOes not come with the scope! or the Rings!! The scope and rings are another 250$

This rifle hasn't been group tested but at 25yds it has repeatedly made ragged holes . If you want to make this into a long range shooter i'm sure it is able just needs a more Target style stock. 

I'm chargin 100 for barrel, 150 for receiver plus work, 200 for the Jard trigger bc it's so new. THe bolt work I usually charge 35 for but it will be free. Comes with 2 magazines.

The rifle exudes history from stock to finish, the only visible detractor from it is that it has a mismatched serialized bolt, which is fairly common place among Mosins.

This one is not counterbored and has the correct stock finish and original bluing, plenty of rifling left and a nice tight muzzle with what looks to be the original crown. 

There are a few (dime size?) A and W stamps (a couple of which actually look raised) on this stock that I believe indicate Austrian use, it also has a small wooden dowel type plug on the bottom where an Austrian style swivel would/might have been screwed in at one time.

Either way the Russian M91 butt part of the stock was later reused and fingerspliced by the ""Finn's"" into what it is now.

I would like $400.00 for this one in a face to face sale in the Richmond, Henrico, Mechanicsville area.


Sling and loops are not part of this sale.

I have not fired this one so I cannot attest to it's accuracy or function, it is exactly as I bought it years ago.

Don't miss out on the opportunity to own this nice piece with no shipping charges or auction hassles and anxiety.

Since I have no idea if/when I'll be able to get another one, the price must go up to meet the demand.
Anyone who has already contacted me about this rifle will not be affected by the increase.

Complete AR-15, M4 configuration.
Gun is essentially brand new. Has only had a few rounds through it to verify proper function.
Comes with a standard M4 upper (true 5.56 chamber, M4 profile barrel, 1:9 twist, M4 feed ramps) with quad rail and rail-height gas block added.
It has a lightweight polymer lower. This is similar material to the frame of a Glock or any other polymer pistol or rifle. Very smooth trigger, ZERO slop between upper and lower, unlike all my other ARs. :)
Whole gun weighs 6.1 lbs without magazine or sights.
Gun does not come with sights or mags, but I have some of each available pretty reasonably if you don't want to hunt down your own.

Price is fairly firm, but partial trade offers for other guns will be considered."

LOOK at the barrel this gun is extremely well built to be the best gun of it time. The original owner ranked for several years in National Shooting events with this gun in mid 1960's. Dont remember the year but he told me he did tried for olympics (didnt make it). All the gear I got with the gun goes. The scope slides in the mounts and has metal caps the screw on for storage. I do not pretend to be a expert but other than expected wear this is in GREAT condition. It does has all some very small spots that cleaning may remove on the action and reciever. From what I can tell the riflings are in great shape. This gun was never carried in the field that much is clear. The box is 32lbs so shipping will be added to the sale price and shipped the cheapest way I can find. Of course a FFL will need to supplied by buyer and payment must clear before shipping. No reserve sale means high bidder gets it.
[Information added 12/8/2012 9:47:55 PM]
I have had several questions. So I will try to sum them up. The scope is a lyman 10x (or so it says). It has 2 metal caps that screw on front and rear. There are 3 clips, a bullet box, a leather shooting glove, a sling with B Carson written on the inside. And what looks like the manual sights front and rear I slid the front sight onto the barrel and it is pictured. Rear have a elevation adjustment and look like new. It also has the some other stuff I have no idea what it is for. I have no idea how many rounds have been through it but i would imagine alot as it was a competition gun so practice is a must. The outside of the gun is in awsome shape other than a very small amount of stain and tiny pits that I assume will mostly come out with someone that knows how to. I got it from B Carson. He is very elderly now so I assume he is the original owner but I have had it for a decade or so. I have never shot it I has just been in the safe. I will gladly answer more questions anytime and I will try to answer ASAP. Happy bidding.

[Information added 12/12/2012 10:17:59 AM]
I have had a few questions so here is more. I can ship via a FFL if needed at no extra cost to buyer. The box looks home made and has some minor damage so I would not expect it to add to the value of the gun although it is the property of the buyer if they want it I will ship it. It would make a great shipping container and I will put cardboard around it to ship. The stock has no major damage I can see but SEVERAL small dents from what I would assume is resting on things while shooting. They do not photo well but think of what you would get if you hit the stock with a ball peen hammer lightly with the rounded end. The finish is fine but the surface is not smooth mainly on the underside of the gun. It is not perfect but for it age in GREAT shape. I can accept credit cards but will need a copy of an ID and a copy of the card faxed to me with written auth for use at the amount of sale. I am a greedy, lazy, rich, small business owner (or so I keep reading in the news) so in between taking time off and ripping off my employees retirement I can run the card at my business at no charge to buyer.

Pistol is in excellent condition and I recently retired it as my daily CCW. This pistol has the Stainless slide. Its seen a lot of range time but I still rate it at 95%. Bore is clean and shiny showing little wear. Includes hard case and all paperwork that came from the factory. Gun was sold with 2 mags, Sale includes 8 drop free Magazines, 5 13 round and 3 17 round with spacers, all are SA OEM stainless mags. The 5 13 round mags have had the base plates replaced with Pearce grip extensions. The original base plates will also come with the Pistol. See the pictures. This is being sold as a package, will not seperate any items. Serious inquiries only please.

CASH ONLY NO TRADES

This is not a stock XD9, the Pistol has had $350.00 worth of upgrades done to it by Springfield Armory. These include installation of a PRP match trigger with a 4.25lb pull, Heinie XD Tritium night sights front and rear and an XD extended mag release. I will provide receipt of the work done with sale of the pistol. Also includes the XD gear that came with the pistol, Holster, dual mag holder and mag loader assist.

If you shop around real hard you can pick one of these up new at about $525.00 tax included, of course that does not include an additional 6 factory magazines at $25.00 each, 5 grip extensions at $10.00 each or $350.00 in tactical upgrades. Between the additional mags and the upgrades that is another $550.00. I am pricing this to sell at $700.00 firm, cash or certified bank check only. I think its a fair price considering what your getting for your money and the Pistol being in excellent conditiion. To be honest I am not in dire need of cash so no low ballers or bargain hunters. This is a high quality sidearm which you can carry daily and know it will go bang if you need it to.

Buyer must be willing to meet FTF within 30 miles of Leesburg FL. Buyer must be willing to sign Firearm Transfer paperwork. In light of all the recet tragic events related to Firearms I will only sell to a buyer who has a current valid Florida Concealed Weapons permit. I realize that I will probably lose potential buyers but I feel better knowing that the buyer has been properly trained in the use of a firearm and has been authorized by the state to own and carry a handgun. Buyer must present a current Florida DL and a concealed Weapons permit prior to transfer of the weapon."

The trigger pull is nice and smooth and the hammer and ejection pin work like champs.  The entire gun has been cleaned and oiled so everything runs smoothly.  The safety for this weapon is located on the right stand of the trigger guard, and that is the only safety for this weapon.  The rear sight is adjustable so one may lower or raise it to their specific requirements.  The barrel length is 17 inches.  The length of the gun is 26 inches without the butt extended, with the butt extend the gun comes to a total of 36 inches.  The magazine can hold 21 rounds + 1 more if there is one chambered.  This is a great little gun, excellent for sport shooting, or that youth that wants a beginner’s firearm.

I have basically a brand new FN FS2000 with a $300 red dot Burress sight. Has less than 100 rounds through it and just dont need it, have plenty of bills to pay. Just sold my daniel defense AR and am trying to get rid of my other rifle. Comes with 2 mags. I have about $2600 invested in the rifle now. Comes with everything I have for the rifle and box for the red dot, fits great and doesnt add any weight to the gun. Very Nice

The rifle is all matching and has a serial number of D82XXX. It is complete except for a cleaning rod. The bluing is dark and virtually perfect. The bore is shiny and the rifling is sharp. I fired about twenty rounds and the gun shoots great. There is no cosmoline on it and from the looks of it the collector never fired much if at all. 
The only criticism I can find of the rifle is that the grain of the wood on the stock is a bit coarse on the left side but this attests to the fact that this rifle was never re-arsenaled and is in excellent condition considering it's age. I wish I had more information on the rifle but I bought it 'as-is' and at the time all I was told was it was a yugo m59/66 with matching numbers. 
This rifle will make a great addition to a collection or it will make someone a fine shooter. If I had not found a great deal on a VEPR in .308 that I just absolutely have to have, I would not sale it. Given the latest political climate, now is the time to get a semi-auto rifle. I'm asking 400 for the rifle, which is what I paid after shipping and ffl transfer fee. FTF sales only, sorry. Cash only, no trades, unless you have a VEPR .308 with 23"" bbl."

I have for sale this Saiga AK, converted myself, chambered in 7.62x39. This is an '09 production gun, imported '11, and I purchased it new this year. Unlike most, this one has a military chamber rather than the ""stepped"" civilian chamber. I chose this specifically because I am a reloader and most Saigas ruin brass. Not many know that the cheap imported steel-cased ammo also has steel-jacketed bullets which are copper-plated. Steel jackets are rough on a gun. I will swear an affidavit that I have never fired anything but my very own cast lead bullets through this gun.

I have primed and painted the stock, grip and foregrip with a textured specialty enamel to Battleship Gray. It is a non-reflective matte finish, unlike the one glossy magazine. I also colorized the proof and makers marks in white and red, as well as the factory roll-stamp, S(afe) and F(ire). Total round count is approximately 500 with 0 malfunctions of any kind. Included in the sale are 8 polymer 30 rd magazines (one of which I tested paint on) modified with a 29rd peephole in case you lose track when loading them. Each has been function-checked. Also included are
Original cleaning rod
Original cleaning/tool kit
Original oil bottle
Factory 10rd magazine (not pictured)

For an additional $100, I will include all of my 7.62x39 reloading dies and brass (approx 350 pieces). The brass alone is worth over $100 in it's once/twice fired state. None has been fired more than twice.

I will ship to any legally-eligible adult in Texas. Long arms can be mailed between individuals within the state without going through a FFL. You must sign two copies of a Bill of Sale I will provide and swear that you are eligible to own this firearm. I will drive as far as south Waco, north Austin, Killeen or Cameron to make a face-to-face cash sale.
Note: No live ammo is for sale."

Kel-Tec P11 Gray Grip Blue Slide 9mm


KEL TEC P-11 GRAY FRAME W/ BLUE SLIDE 

The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. 
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
Calibers: 	9 x 19 mm Luger
Weight unloaded: 	14 oz. 	400g
Loaded magazine: 	6 oz. 	159g

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor.

The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring.

The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."

The Jennings: This gun was purchased new at a gun show in Portland less than a year ago. I bought this after inheriting a bag of about 500 rounds of .22 ammo. I didn't own a .22 so I went to the gun show for the sole purpose of buying a cheap little ""cricket"" as I call it to plink with. It has surprisingly never jammed but only went through about  100 rounds. It has a little 6 round clip and it will come with the holster pictured. I will even throw in the remaining rounds. It is NOT easy to break down for cleaning. I had to youtube a video on how to do it. took longer to get back together as well so buyer beware, do not take part in this deal JUST for the .22.

I'm selling my beloved Baby Eagle. It's been an all time favorite of mine and has never failed me at the range after just a mere round count of 300.
It shoots wonderfully and accurately, it's always been a treat. It handles like a CZ, since the design is based off the Czech's; it has a very strong solid feel to it and the grips allow a natural pointing angle. It has a great double action / single action feel, very clean break and a light pull afterwards that invites double taps. These things are sturdy and know how to take a beating, however I've never abused it and have always cleaned and lubricated it after every session; it was essentially my target plinker of choice. I must say... the Israelis know how to craft a fine firearm.

Here's what you get:

Baby Eagle II Full size 9mm, Steel frame with pictanny rail system
Fiber optic front sight
2 Original box 15 round mags
3 CZ 15 round mags (CZ magazines can be used with this gun!)
50 rounds of American Eagle 147 grain FMJ
Uncle Mike's Size 5 shoulder holster
Original Box with Cleaning kit

I'm asking $700 or best offer
I know some people out there are a thinking the initial pricing is kind of a stretch, but this is a particularly uncommon handgun. I'll take my time with the sale, but I'm open to all offers; 
cash is king.... or I am looking for one other handgun and that is a FNS-9 in a Bi-tone stainless steel, with cash on top or with extra mags/holster.

Selling my Smith and Wesson 300 I got off in a trade.

This is a particularly rare shotgun. Smith and Wesson had very little to do with the shotgun market. This being produced in the 1980's during the scare of all American manufacturing being sent overseas to Japan... This shotgun is infact manufactured in Japan. Yep, good ol' S&W outsourcing to Japan.

This shotgun was competing against the Remington 870 for federal police contracts. However, the Remington 870 was made in the United States; a little bit of conspiracy theories here and there. The Remington 870 was given the contract. Well, this doesn't mean that the Smith and Wesson was a bad shotgun at all, more so this shotgun at the time didn't offer anything new less or more than it's American counterpart. 

Anyways; here's what you get.

S&W Model 3000
Parkerized finish
Extended magazine tube 7+1
I probably forgot to mention that it's in excellent condition.

High quality, all matching,  Bulgarian made surplus rifle parts sets and brand new U.S. parts including barrel and receiver combined with top grade professional assembly makes for a fantastic rifle. 

Each of the rifles begins as a grade 1 all stamped matching Bulgarian AK-74 parts set.
Parts are then professionally assembled by the importer onto a Nodak Spud AK-74 high cap receiver and fitted with a brand new ESS barrel. 

U.S. Parts include Barrel, Receiver, 3 piece G-2 No Slap Trigger set by Tapco, and U.S. made Pistol Grip.

Rifle also features the highly effective and original Bulgarian AK-74 compensator... These things are too cool.

Note - I love this comp and would never change it , but, if you wish to do so it is simply threaded on and can be removed easily
by depressing the retaining plunger pin and un-threading it. It can be replaced with any standard 14x1 left hand threaded compensator.

All metal parts on the rifles look new and are indeed either new or like new in condition.

Original wood furniture has been re-finished to like new condition.
See the picture of the forearm and gas tube cover.... Forearm is the really nice palm swell type and upper covers are beautiful.

Assembly is done to the highest of professional standards ... i.e. no hammers and anvils here.
All metal surfaces are smooth and clean, all rivets are machine seated and overall finish is to original factory standards. 

All rifles are test fired and re-cleaned before being boxed to ship. 

Each rifle includes 2 -30 round mag and is backed by a one year warrenty by the manufacturer. 

A word about barrels. AK-74's have gotten a bad wrap on some forums due to some manufacturers using barrels that were not bored properly which led to rifles being inaccurate or bullets that would keyhole downrange.... That is not the case here - These barrels are made by ESS, one of the premiere civilian and military contract barrel manufacturers in the U.S.  -  They are done right.

We have tested these rifle extensively and they have fired accurately with all bullet weights and brands. 

The rifle bores on these rifles are a true 5.45 diameter and we have been very impressed with the accuracy...

It has never been fired. You will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened. Hello and thank you for checking out our listings. This is a brand new Barrett model 98B in .338 lapua magnum. This rifle is brand new in box and comes with a harris bipod. Carved from years of hard-earned insight, the Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. Designed to adapt to a user’s every need, this revolutionary precision rifle offers long-range performance that others can only dream of. Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it’s not a descendant of anything. This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting. Thanks to its modular layout, this rifle can be adapted to fit each user’s exact needs. Its straight-line design, running from the muzzle to the shooter’s shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip. This allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a fresh round into the chamber as the bolt silently glides through a polymer guide. The Model 98B rifle’s aluminum upper receiver boasts an 18-inch M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions. This impressive long-range weapon isn’t all work. Equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod, it’s also a pleasure to shoot. From its highly efficient muzzle brake to its shooter-adaptable design and unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action.

It has never been fired. You will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened. Hello and thank you for checking out our listings. This is a brand new Barrett model 98B in .338 lapua magnum. This rifle is brand new in box and comes with a harris bipod. Carved from years of hard-earned insight, the Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. Designed to adapt to a user’s every need, this revolutionary precision rifle offers long-range performance that others can only dream of. Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it’s not a descendant of anything. This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting. Thanks to its modular layout, this rifle can be adapted to fit each user’s exact needs. Its straight-line design, running from the muzzle to the shooter’s shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip. This allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a fresh round into the chamber as the bolt silently glides through a polymer guide. The Model 98B rifle’s aluminum upper receiver boasts an 18-inch M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions. This impressive long-range weapon isn’t all work. Equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod, it’s also a pleasure to shoot. From its highly efficient muzzle brake to its shooter-adaptable design and unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action.

I've had the rifle for several years and it has probably less than 200 rds through it. I bought this rifle because I might go elk hunting one day. Well several years later I haven't hunted with a rifle in awhile and I never take this rifle to the range because it's got too much recoil for me. I have taken a deer and a hog in Florida with this rifle and if you hit them anywhere in the body, they will not go far.

The rifle is sighted in at 100 yds within about an inch. I don't have a lead sled or the fortitude to get it any closer free hand.

If your looking for a rifle for a deer stand, especially one in a field, this rifle's for you. I wanted something with a flat trajectory so I could take it elk hunting one day. Check out 7mm RM ballistics on the internet; if you sight in at 100 yds, you should be able to hit a deer inside of 300 yds without much trouble at all.

817,http://www.armslist.com/posts/719817,For Sale:  Brand New 6mm AR Turbo 40 Improved Match Upper & Reloading Kit,"South Minneapolis, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota","$ 1,850","Listed On: Saturday, December 15, 2012",Rifles,no type,no type,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Brand New In Box, never mounted or fired

If you are looking for the most accurate and powerful round that can be used in an upper that fits an AR-15 lower, the 6mm AR Turbo 40° Improved round developed by Robert Whitley, an expert shooter and frequent contributor to AccurateShooter.com and Precision Shooting magazine, is probably as good as it gets.

The description of his highly acclaimed products such as match-grade uppers and custom reloading supplies, including detailed information on the 6mm AR Turbo 40° Improved highlighted here, can be found at his website: http://www.6mmar.com.

To achieve this level of performance, please note that this round is a custom cartridge that requires reloading. The case must first be resized using the 6.5 Grendel brass with a special custom sizing die and then ""fire-formed"" to achieve the 40° case shoulder. If you are not familiar with these reloading steps and techniques or do not want to perform these necessary steps to reload your own ammunition, this is NOT for you. Commercial ammunition is not currently available.

I purchased this complete 6mm AR Turbo 40 Improved upper along with all necessary parts for reloading from Robert Whitley through his company AR-X Enterprises. LLC on November 5, 2012.

This upper has a 26"" Krieger match barrel with a thick-walled DPMS upper receiver and has the right-side charging handle. It comes complete with 2 bolts - the original and an upgraded Nickel Boron-plated high performance bolt. The front ventilated FF tube has a bipod stud as well as a movable handstop complete with a QD swivel. 3 spent cases are also included.

The reloading kit comprises the customized Redding seating and Competition micrometer seating dies, with the correct shellholder and a .266 Titanium Nitride bushing. Spare pin and allen key, 6AR T40 loading instructions are also included. To complete the upper are 4 15 round magazines and a cleaning guide rod.

Are items are brand new, never been mounted, used or fired (other than test firing for the spent cases before my purchase).

After receiving it and lengthy deliberation, I decided to go further to the 338 Lapua. So my change of heart could be your gain!

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

This Mount is slightly used, with specks of tan paint inside the rings from my BSA Deer Hunter Scope. 
There is nothing physically wrong with this mount, and once you place the scope inside you will never notice the slight color difference form the tan paint.
I will not be accepting returns because I want to get rid of it asap and move on to something else. What you see is what you get. 
Feel free to ask me as many questions as you want before purchase if you are feeling uneasy.
