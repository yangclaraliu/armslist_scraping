In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world. This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning. For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

I am sad to let it go but I am consolidating handgun calibers and 45ACP will not be the winner of this. This gun is, by far, the best handgun I've ever shot. I have not shot expensive 1911s, but I have shot most other plastic handguns and this beats them all. It has surprised me, as a mediocre shooter, how much better I am with this in my hand. Enough being sentimental...

The Citadel Government 1911 has a parkerized finish with a 5"" barrel, full length guide rod, ambidextrous safety, Novak-cut dovetail for front and rear sights, skeletonized trigger, extended beavertail and flared ejection port. I'm sure there's some stuff I'm missing, but this 1911 comes with all the bells and whistles from Armscor (RIA), built for Legacy Sports/Howa/Puma under the Citadel name.

What's included:
- Novak front tritium sight (white)
- Wilson Combat extended magazine release
- Wilson Combat flat mainspring housing
- Rob Bonacci trigger job
- Polished feed ramp
- 3x blued Chip McCormick Shooting Star 8-round magazines with base pads
- VZ-style black G10 diamondback grips OR Wilson Combat rosewood double diamond grips
- Original box, grips, parts, paperwork, lock, barrel bushing tool

I used this gun to compete in 3 IDPA matches this year. It shot flawlessly except for Wolf steel. At this point I brought it to Rob and he polished and shaped the feed ramps perfectly. It feeds hollow points, brass FMJ, steel FMJ...it will feed empty cases if you wanted to. Gun is in excellent mechanical condition and very good cosmetic condition with minor holster wear, and some finish wear by the trigger and safety (no idiot mark). The trigger pull is light with an obvious and crisp breaking point, and no overtravel.

Victories were produced for the ""Lend Lease"" program during WWII and shipped to Australia, New Zealand, Britain and other allied countries as well as to defense contractors in the US for security personnel.

This particular revolver was produced in late 1943 or early 1944 and has been refinished in nickel with white grips.

Here are the markings;

Bottom of barrel; V2679xx
Left side of barrel; Smith & Wesson
Right side of bbl; 38 S&W CTG then a different stamp, looks like it was added later; SPECIAL
Above the trigger guard on right side; Made in USA
Right side plate; S&W logo stamp
Bottom of butt; V2679xx
Rear of cylinder; V2679xx
Crane; N 21359 21359
There are no other marks, proof marks or US Property marks.

The nickel is OK, some minor scratches but on the right side it looks like road rash. The cylinder has some deep scratches and the end of the barrel has some as well. The lanyard ring hole on the butt is apparant where it was filled before refinish.

The timing seems good, the lock up is tight and the trigger is wonderful(it is a S&W after all).

It is an easy to shoot quality S&W revolver and would make a great inexpensive home defense weapon for the person who wants something less complicated than a semi-auto. And it has some historical significance."

Here is a brief history on it for those not familiar with it.

The Mosin-Nagant rifle was adopted by Russia in 1891 after trials of several repeating bolt actions. It fires the 7.62x54r cartridge and is a combination of designs by Russian Sergei Mosin and Belgian Leon Nagant whose primary contribution was the feed system. The official designation is “3 line rifle, model 1891”. A “line” is a unit of measure equal to 1/10th of an inch. Production of the Model 1891 took place at the Russian arsenals at Izhevsk, Tula, and Sestroryetsk. Due to a slow start in domestic production a contract was issued to the French arms company Chatellerault who built around 500,000 M91s.

Integral mount requires less than 1"" of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny receiver rail space and locks securely in place with the included steel crossbolt. Windage-adjustable rear sight has two apertures: a large, .185"" peep for engaging close-range targets, and a .70"" peep for longer-range shooting. Although designed for AR-type rifles and carbines, the MBUS may be installed on other weapons with Picatinny receiver rails.

This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. I have much more invested in this weapon than my asking price."

Like all Dan Wesson 1911s, Commander models incorporate top quality parts from the best names in the industry. 

This particular weapon is a 2009 model.  It has had 501 rounds (1 factory test, 500 Remington 230 grain ball) fired through it, and has the following features:

· Round top slide with fixed 3 dot tritium night sights
· Forged, one piece match grade barrel and bushing.
· Ed Brown Bobtail mainspring housing
· 20 LPI checkered front strap
· Hand polished flat surfaces with contrasting bead blasted rounds
· Beveled magwell
· All sharp edges dehorned by hand
· Lowered and flared ejection port
· Ed Brown memory groove grip safety
· Ed Brown slide stop
· Tactical, extended thumb safety
· Commander style match hammer
· Match grade sear
· Aluminum trigger with stainless bow
· Extended serrated magazine catch
· Wolff springs used exclusively
· Diamond checkered coco-bolo grips
· Tuned, machined, internal extractor 
· Test fired for reliability
· 34 ounces unloaded

500 break-in rounds fired after initial cleaning and lubrication using anti-galling gun lube specifically made for stainless steel.   Weapon was then disassembeld, thoroughly hand cleaned and lubricated and reassembled.  Of the 500 rounds fired, there were ZERO misfires, jams, FTFs, or any problems of any kind.

This is the absolute finest 1911 I have ever handled in my life.  The action is silky smooth, the weight and grip are absolutely perfect.  Pistol fires sub 1/2 inch groups at 7 yards (several shots actually went through the same hole), and sub 2"" groups at 25 yards.  You will not find a better commander-sized CCW 45 anywhere in the world.

Comes with original case and all factory paperwork, factory test shell casing, take-down tool, both Dan Wesson factory magazines, 1 spare Chip McCormick Magazine, and gun lock.  

Will ship to your FFL for free to lower 48 states (except areas where weapon is prohibited).  Alaska and Hawaii buyers must pay shipping.

$1495 obo.  Will consider trades for high-end (such as Armalite, Knights MFG, DPMS, or LaRue Tactical) .308 AR style rifle.

It'll come with 3-20 round magazines, 2-13 rounders, and 1-32 rounder. The grips were sanded down by the person that I got this from but other than that there is absolutely nothing wrong with it except a bit of normal wear. 

I also have a 1964 Plymouth Valiant up for trade. It's has a Slant 6 and is a very good running car with surprisingly good gas mileage. It was just painted less than 2 months ago so the exterior looks mint. It had the Carb replaced and the Brakes replaced when I got it. There wasn't much else that needed fixing with the mechanical part of the car it just had a lot of body damage but that's all been taken care of. There is a few things that I'd like for people to know about the car before going any further. The Radio and Gas Gauge have a slight wiring problem(or so I've been told). The Gas Gauge doesn't work and the Radio does work but it turns off after 5 seconds or so. There is a small 1 inch sized crack on the Rear-Right Passenger's Armrest. Other than that everything in the interior, and the overall car, is great. 

The other car I have is a 1999 Grand Prix. It's an Automatic with a V6 so it has pretty good gas mileage. This car is in overall decent condition. The driver's side window doesn't work. It's doesn't have the freshest interior but it's by no means has a bad interior or a trashed up one. It has a dent in the right-rear side of the car. It has 160k miles( I'll have to double check that and update it if it's wrong but I'm pretty sure that's correct). It has no mechanical problems though.

I have pictures of the Valiant and the Hi-Power so let me know if you'd like pics for either of these. I'll get pics of the Grand Prix tomorrow so email me if you're interested."

It started out as an Armalite AR10A4 carbine. The base price for this carbine is $1300. I used the original lightweight barrel last hunting season and took a buck out in Arizona. The carbine had about 100 rounds through it that year. I changed the barrel after hunting season to a Rainer Arms Ultramatch ($400). It’s more of a medium contour and groups nicely. I’ve only put about 20 rounds through the new barrel and used it to take 2x does this year. It also sports a Daniel’s Defense 9.0 AR10 FF rail ($350). I’ve changed the buffer tube out to a standard AR15 carbine tube and added a buffer and spring from Slash’s Heavy Buffers ($135). It’s an XH buffer. It enables one to use the shorter AR15 buffer tube (for more flexibility in choosing a stock) and reduces recoil while increasing reliability. There have been zero stoppages to date. The stock is a VLTOR Emod which in my opinion gives the best cheek weld and length of pull for a scope carbine. It also balances the mid-weight barrel nicely. The scope is a Leupold Mk IV 1.5-5x20mm MR/T with SPR recticle and M2 knobs. It’s mounted in a Larue LT104-30 with throw levers. The package is $1,080 from Larue.
If you do the math, it that comes to $3265 not including the labor, stock, and included Daniels’ Defense sling mount. It’s a great shooter that will hold 1 MOA or less with good ammo. It’s a great balance between weight, length, and precision capability. The tube is barely used and still has thousands of rounds left.

I am asking $3000. I don’t need to sell it, but I am thinking of going a different direction on another project.

With a muzzle velocity of 2550fps and a ballistic tip, this round is all about high performance.  This wicked little round out performs many larger calibers and packs a pretty good punch for its size.  Taurus also offers a unique safety feature with its locking mechanism built right into the gun.  Simply use one of the 2 keys provided to insert right behind the hammer to prevent it from cocking.
