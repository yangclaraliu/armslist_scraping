Hardly used and now i don't ride motorcycle anymore. I paid over $259 for it with taxes. It is in 95% condition, hard to tell it's used. It is the best jacket to buy for the money, not too thick nor thin, it also has protector pads at elbows, and shoulder for extra protection. The size is XL, but fully adjustable at wrist, shoulder and hip position. Has a lot of pockets in and outside, easy to carry stuff. This jacket also can be use to carry a defensive weapon ( pistol ), it has 3 hidden compartments inside, enough for a small/medium frame handgun ( adjustable to fit by zipper ), extra magazine , and a tactical knife (you can even carry a small tactical flashlight, too ). I have no problem to carried all of those when riding ( I carried a Glock 19, extra mag, Sig's knife and a pocket flashlight, and no one even know what i packed inside, extremely concealable )
Beside that, the jacket also provides reflective silver stripes, more safer to ride at night.

Might be interested in a converted Saiga 12 and definately would be interested in a .308 pistol. Not interested in someone's tricked out $2000.00 rig, would rather add upgrades to suit me. I'm not interested in shotguns, hunting rifles, hand guns, or .223 AR unless deal was in my favor I do not have to sell so lowball offers will be ignored. Rifle comes with 6-20rd mags and 1-10rd (for hunting) mag. Rifle rest NOT included. I am best reached by text during the evenings as our cel service is iffy out here in the sticks. REDACTED

DEAL PENDING

More people own and use it now than ever before in history. Members of elite U.S. military units that go into harm's way regularly still carry it, with no plans to use something else. You just can’t find a better platform and cartridge combination than the 1911 to take to war as a secondary weapon. If built by the right people, and used by someone who is competent, there is not a better handgun to take to a fight. If you love custom guns as much as we do, then nothing is as exciting as having a 1911 built to your exact specifications and making it your own. This is especially true when you know your project is being headed up by the best 1911 craftsmen in the industry today.

Until you’ve held and shot a Marlin, you don’t know what a lever-action rifle can be. The ultra-smooth cycling and solid feel are created through a superior receiver design, the finest materials and a flawless meshing of these high-quality components. To produce our trademark excellence, our lever actions are built to strict tolerances rivaling those used to craft custom rifles. Further, all major components of the action are machined from heat-treated, solid steel forgings. The Marlin lever action’s swift pointing characteristics, lightning-fast follow-ups, reliability and inherent accuracy have made it America’s favorite. And what started with the invention of the first flat-top, side-eject receiver in 1889 has led us to pioneer every major advancement in the lever-action category since.

A must-have for every gun collector. It has been in continuous production longer than any other rifle in America. Is it the tack-driving accuracy, superb looks or centerfire-like heft that’s made it such a historical fixture? Yes, in all respects, the Model 39A is incomparable to any rimfire in the world today. Remarkably, it can be disassembled in seconds with only a coin. Thanks to Micro-Groove® rifling, a special process that produces less bullet distortion and a better gas seal, this rifle punches tiny groups most other 22s can’t touch. The stock is crafted of genuine American black walnut and adorned with fine cut checkering. It has a rebounding hammer and a hammer-block safety.

Pretty flexible as far as meeting up goes. I have no problem with trades but would really just prefer the cash. Price is somewhat firm. You could not go out and get a RIA like this for anywhere near this price. I can tell you the trigger job alone makes it worth getting over a brand new one having bought a brand spanking new RIA and now seeing the difference between a stock trigger pull and the 3.5 lb on this gun I can tell you it's amazing."

I will not sell this off in pieces, it all goes together.

RIFLE: Springfield Armory Service Grade M1 Garand from the CMP. This rifle comes with the CMP authentication paperwork. The receiver is a 1944 manufacture. All parts that I can find stamped are SA marked for Springfield Armory. The barrel is a Korean War replacement barrel dated 1952 and is also SA marked. The rifle functions perfectly, no malfunctions. The bore is bright and clean with good rifling. This rifle has been completely detail stripped and all parts have been inspected, cleaned and lubricated. This rifle has a new commercial walnut stock...this is not a war time stock.

BAYONET: This rifle comes with a bayonet that is AFH marked for American Fork and Hoe. The bayonet is well worn with lots of wear but it fits nicely onto the rifle. The bayonet comes with scabbard. 

AMMO: This rifle comes with 270 rounds of .30-06 military surplus ammo. This is Greek HXP and it is non-corrosive and boxer primed. The ammo also comes with four en-bloc clips so you can load your rifle.

SPARE STOCK SET: This rifle comes with an additional spare stock set. This stock set is from the CMP and it is new production birch and is unfinished.

SALES: I prefer to deal face to face as it is easiest for me. If you are a C&R license holder I can meet you for the transaction. If you are not a C&R license holder then we will have to meet at a gun store and do a firearms transfer. Buyer must pay the transfer fee.

SHIPPING: I am willing to ship this via UPS but the buyer must have a C&R license or you must provide FFL info for your local gun store to ship to. ALSO...there are many components here and if you want this shipped then it will cost a lot of $$ for shipping, probably an additional $100. The buyer must pay shipping.

PICTURES: If you are a serious buyer then I can certainly take more photo's of everything and send them to you. Please let me know, thanks

BONUS: I have about 280 rounds of 7.62x54r for the Mosin Nagant family of rifles. This ammo is Hungarian light ball, copper wash steel case, berdan primed, corrosive. If you buy the M1 Garand package I will throw in the 7.62x54r ammunition for FREE!"

THIS IS THE BADDEST SW Mp15/22 you are ever likely to see
1.	There is a custom color fill on the weapon RED and WHITE automotive grade paint it doesn’t chip or flake and its painted to match the very high end Mk416 (same one seals used to shoot binladen)
2.	From the back to the front there is a shoulder cushion (recoil doesn’t require it but its a lot smoother than the highly textured buttpad and it made the gf happy
3.	The grip is a magpul made for right handed shooters and it’s a bit beefier then the stock one, 
4.	The trigger as I already said has new LOW PULL springs in it effectly cutting the trigger pull from 8lbs to 3.5-4lbs never tested but its noticeable and on this light caliber that equals accuracy
5.	The optic is a VORTEX STRIKEFIRE RED/GREEN dot with a high-rise mount with pictinii add on rails, this is the high end version of this it even has a NV feature plus it comes with a doubler so if you need a little more magnification, there is also a (FLASH KILL) basically a honey comb over the front that isn’t removable to hide the glare of the lenses in the sun (makes it look cooler)
6.	The front of the gun, I have three flashhiders that will go with it, the factory Birdcage, a demon (50 bucks) with red fill and the “suppressor shroud” which hides the length of the barrel beyond that rail system. It isn’t a surpressor at all it just looks really freaking cool and that will deff go with it
7.	The light and foregrip I can separate but not really wanting too since I literally had to tape them together, the light is a 280 lumen tactical white light LED with strobe feature and its direct pressure activated only it doesn’t stay on and it switches between (on and strobe) its totally blinding and at night we tested it I couldn’t see the “shooter” plus it will help in close ranges for home defense and the bullets land predictably in the lighted zone (not a lazer but a quick few shots at close range you will be fine.


For the entire package $1000 or an sks plus 400

For the gun with the case, with everything except the optic and the light and the fore grip, the gun plus $300 I still have a cash value on what’s left. 

I have some wiggle room with this if your willing to actually prove you’re here to deal not just talk but I’ve had a lot of people string me along and I don’t have to sell this gun, I built it to be the baddest .22 and gun range gun both things I still consider it so let me know what you think and get back to me.

READ THIS OVER $1400 invested in everything DO NOT OFFER ME 500 please waste someone else time,  I KNOW IT ISNT CHEAP FOR A .22 BUT there is alot invested and I dont have to sell it so DO NOT WASTE MY TIME IF THIS ADD IS UP I STILL HAVE IT"

I'm well aware of what they list for new. Admittedly, I don't have 9k in cash lying around, but I do happen to have stellar examples of three scarce museum quality WWI era pistols that would make the NRA National Firearms Museum jealous. Their value far exceeds that of the Barrett and I'd be willing to trade them flat across. The pistols are an M1907 Roth Steyr, a P08 Luger and a C96 Broomhandle Mauser. Each is not your every day example for reasons I will only discuss privately and only if you have an M82A1 you'd be interested in trading. Please do not contact me unless you do as these firearms are not otherwise for sale or trade under any other circumstances. Thanks!"

A new beavertail grip safety was installed as well as extended slide release, extended thumb safety, extended mag. release, full length guide rod, extended mag well and wrap around grips. I have all the original parts that can be easily reinstalled if prefered.  This Gold Cup has the throated match grade barrel and Bo Mar adjustable sights and has been shot very little. This has been the most accurate pistol I have ever shot and I'm in no hurry to sell it so please no low ball offers. I am willing to trade for other guns but guns should add up to equal value. I have recently gotten my CCW license and this just isnt the gun to do carry If interested let me know what you have.

Buds gun shop which is the lowest price you can find for guns lol sells the blued used Colt Gold Cup for 950, so a used stainless is well worth $1000 then you have the mag well, extended safety and release, guide rod, beavertail grip safety, extended mag release and wrap around grips is valued at well over $150 not including the price to install them. So for one of the best 1911 and most accurate you can get with all these extra I say for $1100 you are getting a great deal."

It functions flawlessly.Manufacturer: FNH USA, Inc.
 The latest handgun innovation by FN Herstal is the FNS-9 9mm Semi Auto Handgun. This handgun is imported by FNH USA. The well thought out design of the FNS-9 results in a stable, highly ergonomic, and ambidextrous pistol that is easy to operate. The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the FNS-9 ensures a short and light identical trigger pull for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting. The low bore axis provides minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for perfect weapon controllability. The FNS-9 also comes standard with three-dot combat sights with a deep rear sight notch. The FNS-9 pistol features a pre-loaded striker mechanism together with a manual safety, hence combining fast and accurate shooting and optimal safety. In addition to the manual safety the FNS-9 features Four Major Safeties: Trigger Safety, Firing Pin Safety, Drop Safety, and an Out-of-Battery Safety. The FNS-9 pistol comes standard with a large number of ergonomic features such as Ultra nonslip checkered grips for better retention and three interchangeable backstrap inserts. The 4'' hammer-forged stainless steel barrel and ultra-hard coating on stainless steel slide and barrel not only make this gun elegant, but also makes it robust. Designed for use in the harshest elements Mother Nature can throw at it. The FNS-9 will feed, reliably, all military and law enforcement ammunition. Has to be transferred thru a PA FFL.
