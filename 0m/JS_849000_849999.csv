ALL chinese SKS's are supposed to be marked with chinese symbols & is supposed to have a triangle with a # inside it. This particular SKS is a very rare gun bc there are no chinese symbols or the triangle on the frame. It is only marked ""SKS7.62X38CHINA"" and also has the serial#. This SKS is a chinese model from the Vietnam War. It was made by the chinese and supplied to the Vietnamese bc their weapon producing factories were bombed and they couldn't manufacture them. There aren't many of these known to exist out there and they're all in private collections bc they're rare. Do some research and you'll see. This isn't your run of the mill SKS.

My grandfather killed a lot of people in the war and this is one of the guns he brought back with him to the states. I had to put the aftermarket stock on (so I could shoot it and make sure it functioned properly, which it does flawlessly) bc the original furniture was damaged during the war. Only asking $1,000 only due to the rarity. It has been appraised for more and would be worth alot more if you could find the stock furniture in good condition.

Looking for something smaller for my wife, so I figure I'll see if anyone wants the classic 1911.  Mine is a Mid 1990's Full Size Auto Ordnance Thompson that I've owned for three years.

This pistol feeds 230 FMJ just fine with zero misfeeds, and hollows shoot great too depending on the brand/ grain.  Safeties all function, decocking works, and this gun is fun to shoot.  Will include several magazines, holster, gun case, and rounds with trade.

Modifications are:
Colt Improved Barrel & Bushing w/ Link & Pin
Re parkerized in 2010, looks great
Crisp lightened trigger.

FTF Seattle area, CPL preferred and would love to meet at a range so we can try eachother's firearms out before trade.

All work was done by Cajun Gun Works, in LA, recognized as one of the best CZ gunsmiths.  This gun is the total package- reliable, accurate, excellent trigger.  The following work has been performed:
-CGW Race hammer for a 3 lb. trigger pull
-CGW EZ Drift Target rear sight
-Fiber optic front sight
-Extended firing pin
-Replacement hammer spring and FPB spring to further reduce trigger pull
-Replacement hammer and firing pin retaining pins
-Polished trigger group surfaces
-Polished feed ramp
-Hougue rubber grips
-Checkered redwood grips
-2 magazines

About $400 worth of work created a truly superb handgun.  It is very, very easy to shoot accurately, will tear through any ammo you feed it, and is just an all around great pistol.  I'm not completely intent on parting with it, just curious to see what I can get for it.

Up for sale or trade is a WASR 10/63 with less than 500 rounds down range. Magazines fit tight and it will include five (5) steel surplus magazines and one (1) Tapco magazine, all 30 round capacity. It has Midwest Industries rails, with a Magpul AFG attached along with a Magpul rail sling adapter. The buttstock is a Magpul MOE buttstock on a 6-position Vltor AK Stock Adapter. The factory grip has been replaced by a US Palm Battle Grip. All parts were purchased new from retailers and are of the highest quality, you get what you pay for. The rifle comes with front sight adjustment tool. I also have an EOTech 557.AR223 that I can include for the right deal, it is the model that has a bullet drop compensator (BDC) with 4 aiming dots to engage on the fly out to 600m and is calibrated for the .223/5.56 round. Please do not lowball me, the rifle and accessories alone before price hikes was easily around $900. I give preference to a good trade and will not hold the rifle unless a 30% non refundable cash deposit can be made. 

Trades:
Will take partial trade for Glock 23 Gen 4 and either another firearm or cash/silver
Silver
AR-15 (5.56mm or Wylde chamber only, no strictly .223)

Japanese type 38 arisaka. A really nice gun, has been sporterized; glass bedded, shortened barrel, rail installed, and professionally re-chambered to 6.5x55swede. A sweet deer/woods gun. Great strong action. This gun was made before the Japanese switched to using sloppy stamped parts during wartime need. Comes with redot (I believe it's a barasaka) and 10 rds. My price is $200

(1) MPA-30 pistol 
(1) Original carrying case
(1) 32 round Sten magazine (can’t find these anymore, even MasterPiece Arms start using Tapco plastic mags)
(1) Tapco mag loader
(1) Fake suppressor (for bump fire fun)
(1) Strap and hanger (Which is legal per ATF it does not make it AOW)

This is the reason I bought this gun in the first place
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXOmyhE2Ouo

It has exactly 224 rounds through it (fired 7 mags though it so far) I bought it as a cool range toy after getting the fake suppressor for bump firing couple mags though it and all my friends seen bump fire I lost interests in the gun so it has been sitting in the safe for 2 years. The bore is so shiny and clean it was hard to take a proper picture of it.

It funny how all of it looks. I'm not the only one that sees it this way. You could buy an ar a while back for 700 yes. Then its funny somebody mention GUNBAN! Then all of a sudden prices sky rocket over night. The people who all jumped on board we need to ban together and let the people know where we stand. They don't like the way the govt is acting towards the people. Well when they didn't seem to have an issue tripling their prices over night, to use someone's fear for there profit. So I can understand the frustration everyone is having. I can still find ar's being sold at there actual value and not what someone is dreaming about. Sorry nothing going on makes them more rare or more valuable. The media mentioned a possible ban and everybody knew people would flood the stores to buy them. So they knew they could make a killer profit off the media BS. Doesn't matter how you slice it, you can not justify how a 700 rifle is now 2000. I have found multiple colt 6920le on here for 2500 to 3000. Well if you know were to look you can still find people who are not trying to ream others for their benefit. Sorry if I offended anyone. There are still good deals out there if you can find honest people. It goes along with gas prices. They talk about a possible shortage what happens. Prices go up and everybody buys as much as they can. Guess what happens in a couple weeks. Prices come back down. Its sad to say when we need to stick together, others see a prime opportunity to take advantage of others."

This has extremely mild recoil with brake installed and trigger is excellent and this is extremely accurate. Scope is a FUJINON and retailed for 639 new and is on par with Zeis, Kahles etc. as far as the quality of optics and is 3.5 to 10 power with a 50mm objective and is very bright and clear , perfect early dawn and dusk hunting as it draws in the light for low light conditions. Scope has the ranging type reticule and is mounted with steel bases and quad lock rings. Would cost over 1200 to have one built with the custom work and optics etc. and with this caliber being able to take anything in North America plus extremely flat shooting it is hard to beat for any type of big game hunting. Comes with some ammo. Will consider selling rifle without scope if interested as it is one of the best scopes I have used, 500 for just rifle with bases or 750 with scope as pictured.
