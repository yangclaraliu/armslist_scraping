It's been cleaned consistently but has accumulated some rust as it's been sitting in a closet most of its life.  It's in great condition except for some cosmetic issues (some scratches where the ventilated guard started to loosen up and slide down the barrel...before I tightened it up, the slide caused some scratches which now have some corrosive rust...nothing major and it needs to be cleaned, polished, etc. Last pic is dark but you can see the damage.

Anyhow, the gun works flawlessly.  I did notice once or twice that the recoil of the weapon caused the safety to engage by accident, so the next shot you're trying to pull the trigger and then you realize the safety came on by itself!  I never did take it in to get it tightened (my gunsmith said he'd do it for free but I've been too lazy to go in and get it done), but that would be the only thing it might need.  Most of you could probably adjust that on you're own.

I paid about $250 or so for this weapon and it retails for about $280 now before taxes, etc. but I need some cash, so this is a great deal.  We could meet at one of the local dealers to get the paper work taken care of.  I'd like to have this transaction completed by the end of this month."

Here's the story. Back several years ago, this guy named Mike at a place called The Firing Line had a little over 200 Romy G kits. I was looking for a few, so I spent about 1/2 a day going through them and I bought 3. This is the one that was the cream of the crop. This is THE nicest Romy G kit I've ever seen. As you can see by the photo's, it's an ALL, and I mean ALL numbers matching kit that is unfired and has a beautiful set of honey blonde furniture with it. The only word that came to my mind when I saw this kit was ""stunning"". I told Mike, ""That's the one!"". ANYWAY. I've got ALL the parts to build this kit into a A+ grade AK47. Here's what you get:

- 1978 Romy G kit, complete with original fire control parts.
- CAI trigger group, 922R compliant
- AK Builder rivets 
- new trunion pin
- Tapco piston 922R compliant
- US made slant break 
- Nodak/Spud NDS-1 receiver with matching serial number to the kit and Romanian engraving, also done by Nodak
- Dimilling done (except pressing out the barrel).

As you can see by counting, this will be a 100% 922R compliant rifle when finished. 

I'm asking $520 for the entire package. Must do a 4473 form on the receiver.  And no, I will NOT split anything up.

I will delete it shortly.

I leave it temporarily in order to reply to a rather amusing message received today, which I presume is not typical of those who use this site, or, one would hope, of responsible firearms enthusiasts and owners in general.  It reads as follows:

======
""Message from REDACTED, hit 'reply' to reply to the original sender.
            Dude your grips are pachmeyers.  Vintage my ass.""
=======

Of course, there is no way to reply to the fake address used, or I would have been happy to inform Mr. ""Mehoff"" that 
1) the correct spelling is ""Pachmayr"" and 
2) my understanding is that ""vintage"" is defined as more than 20 years old, and I believe the grips are at least that old. Since the original patent on the Pachmayr Signature grip appears to have been issued in 1974, the seller could hardly be claiming they were original to the gun. 
For what it's worth, I'm also not a ""dude"".

I also include here for your amusement the reply I would like to have written to ""Jack"", and to all those who seem to feel rudeness is the sine qua non for Internet communication.

============================================================
Dear jackmeoff:

Thank you for your message.  The post in question was supposed to have been removed after only a few days, and it was my understanding that had been done. I will make sure it is  deleted right away.  I will note also I am a computer consultant, and not someone knowledgeable about firearms.  I posted the ad in good faith for a friend who was temporarily both homeless and without Internet access.  

It is my understanding that firearms must be cleaned and oiled, or they can fail to function properly, even causing harm to the user.  Just as firearms require certain care to function, so does society.  However, in the case of human beings, courtesy and etiquette are the oil that enables different personalities to interact with each other without friction.

Likewise, no one fires a weapon without both aiming AND making certain they have identified the correct target.  You may well be an expert on certain firearms. However, if you take the same approach toward your guns and your aim as you seem to toward other people, you are obviously firing a rusty gun at the wrong target, often hitting and potentially harming an innocent bystander - or finding that your shots may backfire.

I would suggest that you consider modifying both your bogus e-mail address and your mode of correspondence to exercise at least the same care and courtesy before you fire an e-mail as you do before you fire a weapon.

Again, I appreciate you calling the ad and the error to my attention, and I will make sure the problem is remedied immediately.

Sincerely,
Karen

While unusual for military issue in that a reflective polish was used, it was chosen due to its relative cheapness as well as quicker build time. Problems related to the durability of the aluminium frame were resolved prior to the development of the PA-63 in 1961 with the production of the FÉG R-61 Police Pistol. The addition of .1% titanium to the aluminium alloy solved premature alloy frame wear problems inherent in the earlier FÉG aluminium framed pistols. This development was then applied to all aluminium framed FÉG guns including the PA-63."

It also had the slide and channel polished for easier action. It has the night sights installed.This made it one of the most accurate and easy to fire pistols I have ever had. The serial number is TVM3259 so you can check it out, Plus I have the original receipt. 
The gun comes with (3) 15 round clips, a 2 clip holder case, a hip holster, and original box and paperwork. This pistol online has been selling for $650-800 for just the stock pistol. Everyone who shoots this gun wants to buy it.

 this gun has been fired very little. he has come across tight times like most of us and just needs the money. 

 some of the features on this gun is an unscrewable barrel. which allows this gun to break down really small. it has an 18"" carbide barrel with a pull out shoulder stock.it comes with 2 high capacity clips ( 25 or 30) can't remember exact but long clips.  it has the original box with all the original paper work. 

 this gun styles alot like an uzi with longer barrel. truely an unique gun. and one that most people will not be able to get there hands on. i hate that he is selling this now, if my money wasn;t so tight i would buy it. 

 he is firm on price. needs to pay some back taxes. and while he needs money he will not give it away. so the only nedgotiating will be you trying to give more for it. which i doubt you will..

 he will not hold the gun. the first person to put money in hand walks away with the gun. no paper work. 

 if you have more questions send me email.  i will try to answer all that i can. the gun is in my possession. i have checked it. everything in working order. but gun is being sold as is. being it's age and the fact it is out of production.

It is used but in great condition,unknown round count.
Original stock has some nicks,scratches from normal usage.Also has an extra sling mount hole on left side of buttstock.
It is the straight cut receiver. That means you can install typical AK furniture(with some minor sanding work)

The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9 mm Luger cartridge.

The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 10 or 9 round capacity. The Kel- Tec P-11 is the smallest and lightest 9 mm ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially suited for plainclothes police officers or as a secondary weapon for military personnel. From the very beginning of the design and development, computers have been used exclusively. All machined components are also made on modern high speed computerized equipment. Equally advanced quality control equipment and test procedures ensure a firearm with uncompromising quality in materials and workmanship

CONSTRUCTION

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine.

The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism.

The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards.

The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard.

Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine, the P-11 will also accept standard S&W large capacity clips. To improve the handling with S&W magazines we recommend using our slip on magazine extension."
