Some extra from Cold Steel . . .

Sharp as Saladin’s legendary blade, the sleek, classically curved Cold Steel® Scimitar® places the power of the sword in your pocket.
Our craftsmen have captured the timeless quality of superior cutlery and united it with the finest in modern materials. The result is a dazzling, high impact folding linerlock® like no other knife available.
The Scimitar® blade is hollow ground stainless steel, honed to razor sharpness and features the famous curve of its ancient namesake. Painstakingly designed to facilitate the draw cut, the most effective cutting stroke known to man, the blade also features a needle sharp point which pierces at the slightest touch.

Superior engineering combines traditional appeal with the latest Western technology in the contoured Zytel® and steel frame handle designed exclusively by Lynn Thompson for the Cold Steel® Scimitar.® The pistol grip handle facilitates all types of forward grips, including the saber, quarter saber and hammer grips. Its sleek curves, finger grooves and checkering settle naturally and securely into the hand, maximizing the user’s ability to control both the edge and the point. Reverse or palm reinforced grips are mastered with ease, making the pistol grip shape of the Cold Steel® Scimitar® handle one of the most versatile and user-friendly ever devised. A hard-hitting ball shaped pommel contributes to the Scimitar’s® rock steady grip and versatility. The pommel can be used as a striking tool to deliver less than lethal blows to nerve centers and soft targets. It can also serve as a secondary grasping point, allowing the user to extend his reach by as much as three inches.

Lock strength is critical in a high performance knife, and the Scimitar® is head and shoulders above the rest. We have equipped the Scimitar® with a state-of-the-art titanium linerlock® for maximum strength and durability. The strength of titanium is peerless in the cutlery industry, and tests on this mechanism resulted in it holding 100 pounds without collapsing, far exceeding the load-bearing ability of our competitors.

A pocket clip makes it a snap to carry and access quick as a flash. Feel the extraordinary power of history’s most famous sword design in a folding knife of unequaled versatility- and put it in your pocket - with Cold Steel's Scimitar®.

The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge.The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns.

Has some finish wear, a few nicks a dings on stock, and some sort of odd ""dimpling"" on the receiver, but otherwise in fine condition for its age. 
There's also a small wear mark on the bottom of the barrel, but it's not too noticeable, and doesn't show up at all in the photos. It looks like the blueing may have been touched up in that spot at some point in the past, but I can't say for sure.
Bore is like a mirror.
All 'defects' are as expected from years of hunting in the field.
This would make a fine hunting gun for upland game or really anything that flies, crawls, runs or hops!

Price fairly firm, partial trades considered, but I mostly need cash, since I'm selling this for an older friend who doesn't have internet access.
The gun belonged to his father who died in (I think) 1991, so the gun hasn't been shot in quite a while. I'll be happy to test fire it for you or you can shoot it yourself when you come to check it out.

More photos available upon request, for serious buyers only.

Can be use as a gun safe. I am posting this safe for my Step-Dad (he don't like posting or doing business on line - as he put it ""I'm a low tech man in a high tech world""...lol). Anyway, the safe originally came from a U.S. Post Office (somewhere in a small town in Eastern KY). To my understanding, a lady that used to work in the post office had the safe in her basement for at least 30 years. My Step-Dad does carpentry work on the side, and the safe is part of his pay for doing carpentry work (he's just trying to get his money back). The safe is located in Eastern Kentucky (Floyd County). See the pics, and just email me for any questions. And I will try my best to answer the questions. By the way, the safe is on wheels (as pictured), but can be taken off, and weight at least 2,500 pounds. The safe has the combination plus key features. This safe is built like Fort Knox. Asking for $1,200 firm, or trade. It is a $2,000 or more safe (just need some TLC or new paint). Thanks for looking.

Barrel: 20"" Nickel Steel

Finish: Blued worn down to a nice silver with strong bluing still in protected areas. Firebluing on the loading gate is still visible.

Bore: is in outstanding condition. An easy 8-9 out of 10.

Sights: 
Rear: Earliest style flip up ladder sight(One just like mine, but in far worse condition just sold on eBay for $182.49 for the sight alone!) 
Front: Blade bead with ivory bead insert

Wood: Forend is in good condition overall. Stock has some shrinkage and someone put a recoil pad on it before I got it.

Metal: overall the metal is in really good shape with no real pitting or major handling marks aside from:
The saddle ring stud broke off. This is an easy fix. $18 in parts and $20 in labor.
The upper tang has a very old repair on it. This does not affect the function at all.

I would estimate it to be ~90% condition finish due to some minor cosmetic blemishes (e.g. scratch where the add-on thumb safety used to go). Functionally it is 100%. The only thing missing is the add-on thumb safety. Imported by PW Arms - I am the first US owner of this fine shooting handgun.

Includes the following:
-Yugo M57 Tokarev 7.62x25mm military surplus pistol (C&R eligible), shiny bore
-1 original military surplus M57 magazine (100% reliable)
-3 US-made M57 magazines (not 100% reliable in my experience)
-9mm drop-in conversion barrel
-Tokarev compensator (replaces stock barrel bushing, usable in either 7.62x25mm or 9mm)
-140 rounds of Yugoslavian FMJ surplus Tokarev pistol ammo (brass cased, corrosive primed)
-100 rounds of PPU FMJ brass-cased, non-corrosive commercial ammo
-used blue Beretta plastic pistol case

Basically, for what you would pay for a cosmoline-covered surplus M57 shipped to your door (if you have a C&R license like I do) you get all the extras, ability to shoot 9mm, and 240 rounds of Tokarev ammo (the Yugo FMJ is nearly impossible to find now).

Buyer must be legally able to purchase and own a handgun, and must be willing to sign a sales receipt.

If you're interested in replacing the grip panels, I have a new in box Hogue Handall Jr. and a 12x12x0.06"" sheet of Kydex-T I can include for an additional $10. You can find instructions and pics for the mod on the Steyr Club forums."

They both charge $40, and combined with the fuel costs of getting to NGE or dealing with Dave's horrible attitude at Riverview, it's just not worth it at all.

I've heard of a place called Anthony's Collectibles in Windsor Locks, and supposedly he only charges $15. He would be an incredible asset since I work right off 75 in Suffield, but he's still on his military deployment and there's no hint of when he'll be back.

I'm looking for someone who ideally is closer/cheaper/not a jerk. You'll get plenty of references and continued business from me as I'm constantly looking for new toys and have several friends who like to shop online too.

Thanks!"

It is in excellent condition just a trace of blue wear on the one side of the barrel as the pictures show (the barrel is stainless, its right side is blued). There is no wear or damage to the blue on the slide of the gun at all. The gun has had about 100 rounds through it tops, always shoots well and at POA. There are two mags with it (the extra mag is 25.00 alone).

This is an ideal carry gun, easily disappears in a pocket with a pocket holster or in an IWB holster, yet can easily be controlled and shot accurately.

Rifle: $1450 EoTech Sight: $400 

This is the Colt 6940 Law Enforcement Carbine. It's marked Restricted for Law Enforcement/Military use only, as Colt was contracted to make them before the ban was lifted. Fairly rare as you can't buy this version anymore; it's also one of the best out of the box AR's ever produced. Check out the reviews online! 

It has the one-piece monolithic upper, collapsible stock, and folding sights. The stock grip was changed out for an Ergo Grip rubberized one. 

The rifle is in basically perfect condition save for a toolmark on the flash hider. A new one costs about ten dollars; you just screw it on the end of the barrel. I didn't replace it because it's only cosmetic and you can hardly notice it anyway. No scratches or dings on the rifle anywhere, and no wear on the rails to speak of either. 

The rifle has around 1000 rounds or so through it. 

It'll come with two mags as well; the Colt factory mag, and the magnificent Magpul P-Mag. Both hold 30 rounds. 

It also has the EoTech XPS2-0 holographic sight for it (with standard cirle and dot reticle), which is basically brand new. A new one costs around $500. 

You're welcome to make me an offer; keep in mind my asking price for both the M4 and the EoTech is less than the original cost of the rifle alone."

This rifle is chambered in 223. The stock is an olive drab green hogue stock that is pillar bedded. It also has a 20 inch fluted heavy barrel. The twist rate is 1:9. The muzzle was professionally threaded 1/2x28. Also installed is a YHM compensator/qd suppressor mount. An oversized tactical bolt knob has also been installed. The factory trigger seems to have a really awesome pull but I have not fired it. This rifle has never been fired at all. It has been moved around a bit and does have a few handling marks but nothing more. The rifle has a 20moa picatinny top mount rail. The scope is a 16x42 SWFA Super Sniper Scope that hasn't been zeroed in. The scope also has a sun shade and butler creek flip caps. The scope rings are UTG quick detach rings. 


FN guarantees these rifles to shoot 1 moa. This rifle should easily shoot sub moa if the shooter does his or her part. I originally purchased this rifle to hunt coyotes on my farm. After scouting my land for a few nights, I realize that most of my targets are going to be in brushy areas because this is where they roost.

I will consider shipping the rifle at the buyer's expense. Thanks for looking."

The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The Chiappa Rhino barrelis aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component toRhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the centerof gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with theshooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaginga target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil andmuzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than everbefore. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra lightalloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverseeffect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typicalrevolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double andsingle action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammercocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

   * windage and elevation adjusts
   * tactical cross dot
1 3x30 magnifier w/ Picatinny mount

I have a brand new set of Meprolight Sights I ordered for my P-01. I never installed them. They were purchased new on 3/27/12 from CZ USA.

I believe they are part number 17775 (meprolight) and the front is a #4. The front sights are usually ordered by height, and the rears should all be the same height. All of this being said, these should be a straight replacement of the stock P01 sights.

I have everything that came with it and 2 box's of 100 rounds which I origanaly bought when I got the gun. I have only fired 42 bullet's through it since I bought it new. It's a fantasic gun and a lot of fun to shoot. If your interested please let me now or any questions feel free to ask. I'll also include the 158 round's left over.

The gun is selling new for around $309.00 or more, that's this model! So you save $69. on the retail cost and $27.81 on tax..... That's a total of $96.81 plus the bullet's for that's I'm throwing in at no cost.

Yes, that sounds like I'm asking for a lot, but it never hurts to ask, as people do sell their guns and end up with mags left, and Marines do get out of the Corps and end up with lots of new mags left, just as I did when I retired.

If you have used ones, very cheap, are a Marine, and give me your word as a Marine that they function well, I can go with used mags., provided they don't look like they've been run over by or been kept in the back of a 7 ton truck.  I'm using these in my own firearm, and not selling them, so yes, they really do need to function correctly.

Email with brand, qty., price, and lets see if we can work out a deal.  I can get new ones on line from $10.00 on up, so please keep that in mind.  My preference is for G.I. issue metal mags and Magpul mags., but let me know what you have.

Walther PPS is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses modified Browning type locking with tilting barrel. Frame of the gun is made from impact resistant polymer. Trigger is of double action only type, striker fired, with pre-cocked striker system, similar to QA system used in Walther P99 pistols. This system requires a manual recocking (by partial slide retraction) in the case of misfire. Gun is fitted with automated trigger safety and firing pin block; additional ""storage type"" safety is provided by removable backstrap of the grip; once backstrap is removed, the firing pin is automatically decocked and gun is blocked until the backstrap is reinstalled. This patented system is called QuickSafe by Walther. Sights"

Based on the combat-proven G36 rifle used by the German Army, the SL8-6 uses a proven short stroke, piston-actuated gas operating system, well known for simplicity and reliability. Designed and engineered to deliver exceptional shooting performance, the SL8 is a favorite among European target shooters, due in large part to its modular construction and free-floating bull barrel. A short Picatinny rail mount is standard and allows accessory optics to be easily added. Made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process, the SL8-6 barrel ensures accuracy and long life. The ergonomic and clean lines of the HK SL8-6 are functional and modern, giving the SL8-6 the look and feel of a 21st century firearm."

HK MP5 SD .22LR. This is a licenced HK product.  Has HK stampings, worlds ahead of the GSG5 that is regularly seen.  Comes chambered in .22LR, cheap fun plinker with full size rifle feel, weight and controls. Steel upper, polymer lower. In very good condition.  Only wear marks are from rail mount that was on the rifle.  Extremely reliable and accurate.  Will eat any cheap ammo you can put through it.  It is not ammo sensitive like the GSG copy. Comes with 1 original magazine, instruction manual and tool for adjusting ammo velocity, though I've never had to use it.  I've run 1200fps and 1650fps ammo through it fine.  I'd expect sub sonic to run fine too, but never tried it.  Break down is super easy with 2 push pins.  Don't deal with tons of screws like the GSG.  

If you are reading this ad, it is still available.

DO NOT ask me to meet you half way somewhere in a parking lot.  YOU MUST come to me to pick up. Bring a rifle bag with you, or I can throw in a basic hunting rifle bag for $10 extra.  No carrying it openly to your car.

966,http://www.armslist.com/posts/459966,For Sale:  Tasco Pro Class 4X Handgun/Scout Scope,"Greeley or Windsor, Fort Collins, Colorado",$ 165,"Listed On: Thursday, October 18, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"It's in new condition with box, instructions, scope covers and does not look like it was ever mounted. It has the larger 30mm tube and a unique tapered crosshair with a small dot in the center for a reticule. It is one brand of only two I am aware of that has the adjustable parallax feature on a handgun/scout scope. I find the AO especially applicable for its use on rim fires. The distances encountered vary from 10 to 100 yards or more and at the closer ranges the parallax in non-AO handgun scopes is too great for precision shooting. It also has some nice target turrets that allow quick changes for near to far distance shooting. The lowest setting on the AO is at 25 yards but it turns below that and seems to provide a very clear image down below 10 yards. This would make it ideal for use on a high quality pellet pistol for basement shooting. On the box it gives model #P4X30. It was made in Japan some years ago where it seems more premium optics come from. My price of $165 is firm as I should be trying harder to find a use for it vs. passing it on.  Will ship for $10 extra.

MADE IN SPAIN BY FELIX SARASQUETA Y CIA

There are 3 Sarasqueta names, Victor, Felix, and JJ
Victor Sarasqueta was one of the dominant Spanish gunmakers until it went out of business in the early 80's. During its heyday, Sarasqueta and AyA were the two biggest companies.

As a result there were other members of the Sarasqueta family that made guns attempting to cash in on the family name. Felix is the most common although there was a J.J. Sarasqueta and subsequently a company called the ""Sons and Widow of J.J. Sarasqueta."
