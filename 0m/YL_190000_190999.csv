US Military Snipers and marksmen overseas found themselves rapidly switching from scenarios involving precision long range shooting one moment, to close, violent encounters where they were at a disadvantage due to the low ammunition capacity and slow rate of fire of their bolt action rifles. The Government sought a solution to this problem...The DPMS SASS is the answer.

With an 18â fluted bull barrel, free floating 4 rail hand-guards, and JP adjustable Trigger, it is capable of sub-MOA accuracy at long range, fulfilling its role as a precision rifle. The 19 + 1 ammunition capacity and semi auto fire control group ensure the shooter is never outgunned, and allows for faster follow up shots. The Magpul PRS stock (new for 2008, previous models feature a VLTOR modstock), Panther Flash hider, DPMS Mangonel back up iron sights, and A3 receiver, complete the package.

The U.S. Armed Services established Mil-Spec 3443E in a brutal and unforgiving torture test with 3,000 rounds of full power 12 gauge buckshot. Only one pump action shotgun was able to pass this test: The Mossberg 590A1.

Today the Mossberg 590 Series is recognized as state-of-the-art when it comes to heavy-duty police/military slide action shotguns. It is engineered to the exacting standards of the National Institute of Justice. Standard features include dual action bars, corrosion resistant parkerized finish, ambidextrous tang safety and ""swab straight through"" magazine tube.

Now you can own the same MossbergÂ® 590A1â¢ shotguns that have served with distinction around the world. With its rock solid reputation on the streets and on the battlefield, the MossbergÂ® 590A1â¢ has become the choice for the modern duty shotgun. Men and women in uniform need a rugged, dependable firearm they can rely on day in and day out, no matter the conditions. Mossberg's 590A1 shotguns have posted the credentials and track record over several decades to earn their trust. Previously offered almost exclusively to law enforcement agencies and military organizations, Mossberg now offers civilians 590A1 Special Purposeâ¢ models built to the same rigorously-tested specifications demanded by those in uniform.

This is the checkered stock with better quality wood, as well as having the cross-bolt safety and the lost shot hold open!  I think EVERYONE should have at least one in their collection.  This particular rifle is discounted because of a few cosmetic flaws.  It has one small crack in the stock as well as some pitting at the end of the barrel near the front sight.  Other than that, it should make someone a great shooter, or a great truck gun that you don't have to worry about every knick and scratch.  If it doesn't sell, I will likely work on it and get it more presentable and relist at market value.  It may even end up pink for the LADIES if I don't sell it or get it traded soon!

We have carbines on the rack and for sale. These are the most reliable and hard use AR15 style weapon systems available anywhereâ¦we guarantee it. We have a lifetime warranty and a no questions asked free gun smithing policy. If the firearm breaks, malfunctions or does not perform as advertised due to a manufacturing defect, we will fix it, replace it or refund the full purchase price. Even if you abuse the firearm and void the warranty, we will still fix it with at labor cost. The customer only pays for parts (at a reduced cost) and shipping (if applicable). This is forever and transferable. 

The AM15-C was designed for extreme duty use and is also ideal for the recreational shooting enthusiast or competitive marksman. These carbines are exactly the same as our combat proven AM4-A1 fully automatic carbines with the exception of a semi auto fire control group, 16â M4 contour barrel and a semi auto only fire control group recess area machined in the lower receiver. Other than these small differences, the AM15-C is of the same hard use MIL-STD quality as our fully automatic weapon systems. If you care about quality, reliability and owning an American Made product that will last a lifetime, call or email.  

Premium 7075-T6 forged aircraft grade aluminum alloy upper receiver, lower receiver and charging handle. 

Type III, class II hard coat anodize per MIL-A-8625 .001 +/- 10%

4150 CMV MP (magnetic particle) and pressure tested ordnance grade barrel steel, contoured per govât drawing, 5.56mm NATO chamber, 1-7 twist and chrome lined per MIL-STD.

Double heat shield M4 hand guards

Detachable (600m) carry handle / flat top upper receiver with internal dry film lube per MIL-STD and M4 feed ramps (machined per govât drawing).

Compare the AM15-C carbine to any AR15 out there and feel the difference precise manufacturing can produce. If something is manufactured the way it should be, by those that understand how it should be utilized, it will perform as intendedâ¦and it should not cost a fortune.  

We are an in house manufacturer, not a parts gun assembler. We do not vendor out any of our main components. We are a CCR registered government contractor with CAGE Code: 57GQ2.

Currently, these carbines are factory direct only. You will not find one anywhere else for any price.

Comes in original S&W case with paperwork. This particular model is fairly hard to find.

I will also include a Crossbreed Supertuck that I got when I got the gun, though admittedly it is in somewhat rough shape from use but is certainly still usable - it was modified by the original owner who cut the higher portion off to make it easier to get a positive grip on draw.  I also ran across a black OWB with a black trim panel that I can include; this holster was not made for this firearm, but it fits just fine (I THINK it was made for a Sig P250).

I also have 140 rounds of Federal FMJ, 40 rounds of Hornaday TAP, and 40 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense that I will include for an additional $75. This ammo is not for sale seperately, at least not until the gun is gone. Will also trade the ammo for about 400 9mm FMJ if you would prefer.

Additional pictures available to interested parties upon request.

This is a reproduction of the 1847 Colt Walker .44 caliber pistol.  Made by Armi San Marcos in Italy.  These are among the highest quality replicas available,  completely functional, and designed exactly like the originals.  Actually, these are better than the originals in construction and action, considering modern steel is higher grade than what was available back then.  The engraved indian battle scene on the cylinder looks incredible, nice color on the case hardened frame, blueing shines great.

  LIKE-NEW and never fired.  Complete with the original locking oak box, keys, and all the items in the picture.  

 Make offer....  I've seen these retail for anywhere from $200 to $600 online, depending on quality + accessories.   Let me know what you have and we'll talk.

This rifle is in excellent condition. It's a great shooting rifle that far outshoots my abilities! As can be seen, I have the original box and paperwork to go along with it. Everything functions perfect. The rifle is in perfect condition and has been cleaned after every shoot.
The scope is in perfect condition and works flawlessly. It is a BSA Contender 6-24x40.

Pistol has a 1 in 20 rifling twist. This is a fast twist that stabilizes conical bullets, mini balls and patched round balls. You can also get .50 caliber sabots that you place a .45 caliber handgun bullet in. So you can shoot .45 acp style jacketed hollow points if you use the plastic sabot.

If you use a round ball a .490 round ball with a .015 thick patch will fit nicely.
For powder charges you can use as little as 30 grains of FFFg on up to 45 gr of FFFg black powder.

Accurate and powerful enough to take small game or deer at close ranges out to 30 yards or so.

Well, after debating for several years, I have decided to part with one of my prized possessions; this was the first shotgun I ever owned, having bought it from my next-door-neighbor way back in 1980; he had only bought it the year before, and didn't want to hunt anymore due to sudden health issues, so he sold it to me. Sometime in the mid- to late 90's, I bought a 26' light contour RemChoke w/ventilated rib barrel, and that's the only barrel this gun comes with; I see from the various websites out there that the same barrel, with 3 choke tubes, sells for about $209 today. There are 3 factory Remington choke tubes included - Imp. Cylinder, Modified, and Full - Steel or Lead. I also will include a Mossberg Skeet tube that was made for the 870, along with the wrench needed to install them. In addition, the stock and forend have been expertly refinished by my late Father, and they look fantastic. There are a couple of light, hairline scratches on the receiver (which is chambered only for 2 3/4"" shells, so please make a note of this), but overall, the finish is in excellent condition; the gun would rate at least 95%+, according to the Blue Book grading guidelines. The  only thing I would mention as a potential negative would be the fact that the bluing has worn off of most of the magazine tube, which would be rather common in this model gun, especially for one of this age.

Considering the price of the barrel alone, this gun is an excellent value - I'll entertain reasonable offers, but if you're not in the range of my target price, I'll have to keep it. If you're looking for a great waterfowling gun, your search is over!

Just putting it out there to see what I can get. Most gun afficianados know that these are RARE handguns to still find. Prices range between $250-400 & more for certain models. Mine is in fact a Russian IMEZ IJ70-18A. It has adjustable rear sight. Bluing is about 75% b/c of it's age. These things will not jam up unless you are using sub-standard ammo. Goes bang everytime! I've researched this gun & I know what's it is worth. I suggest the next owner do the same. I am very partial to this gun and don't really want to get rid of it, but I want something else where ammo is plentiful. Will meet in person and sign a bill of sale. You will need a purchasing permit or ccw. If trading, just a bill of sale will be fine as this is a civil agreement. Pics upon request. Really nice shooting and handling handgun. It comes with one standard 8 rd magazine. Please don't waste mine or your time, serious offers considered. Make an offer or trade. Will reply to all offers unless they're plain silly. Thanks for reading!"

I'm just in school now full time, moving around a lot, and simply don't have the time to use everything - so I'm moving it on. It's a fun shooter, real accurate. Perfect brush gun, home defense, plinker even (with 38's). These are real tough to find, and expensive as heck if you can; there's good reason to that - they're great firearms.

You can see it pictured with 3-1/16"" barrel Ruger SP101 that is also for sale, and also chambered in 35 caliber (357MAG/38SPL). Would make a great combo. Bought that at the same time, has seen probably 300-500 rounds - most of that 357 (38's just become a pain to clean). Also is in excellent condition and has been cared for very well, including a yearly take-down (I'm a bit of a perfectionist). Asking $450, I have the old handle inserts for you on that as well.

Also have some ammo that has been stored in a sealed ammo can with desiccant. I'll see these with the gun(s), or not until after the guns have sold (in which case I'll relist), thanks.
-5 boxes of Federal and 1 Blazer in 357MAG (we can do $20/box). The Federal is the best shooting target ammo I could ever find in 357.
-1 box of Federal in 38SPL ($15/box)
