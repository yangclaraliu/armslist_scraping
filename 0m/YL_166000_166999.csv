The stock has minor dings on the under side of the stock from normal usage while issued to soldiers. there is a little bit of blueing wear on some pieces. over all is in great condition. it looks like it was issued but never in war. the numbers that do not match are just the bolt. but is very close to the rifles number. rifle is BD13544 and the bolt is BD13524. just 20 numbers off. These Polish M44 are the best made, even better then there Russain counter parts. I shot about 10 rounds through her and she actualy breathes fire about a foot out of the muzzle, you can see it in broad day light. She has the side folding bayonet as well. i bought this rifle last year from a very old man. he was a collector and had no one to pass his rifles down to. Knowing he was going to leave this earth behind soon he decided to sell his collection to a select few people. He told me he bought this rifle back in the 60's. shot it once and then filled her up with cosmoline. When i bought it, it was still full of cosmoline. The rifle was made in 1952. also has a origonal russian sling i bought sepratly with her. Comes with an ammo pouch. i would prefure a local sale but if your not local and really want it and are able to pay for all the FFL stuff to ship it then Im ok with that.

But, because it is a Dan Wesson Arms, made in Monson, Mass., I think it may be a collector. I know it shoots dead-on at 35 ft, I know it locks up tight and I know it's old and still looks good. If a Dan expert can tell me if I am too high or too low on the price, all info will be considered and appreciated.
I will consider a trade for a clean Ruger P89, which according to gunbroker.com has a value in the same neighborhood as what I'm asking.
This is not a new gun, it has been used but, certainly not abused. Afterall, I'm not asking a fortune for it either."

This has a Magpul MOE buttstock on it, a Wilson Combat aluminum tactical trigger guard which is oversized for winter shooting with gloves and fills the annoying gap in front of the pistol grip. I do not plan on including the vertical Foregrip with the sale but I am including a 20 rd and 30 rd mag with the rifle.  I really do not want to be sell these firearms but my dog was hit by a car and I have vet bills to recoup from so here we are and currently I am selling and AR15, a Military Arsenal 26 Chinese SKS and possibly my very old H&R Young America which is a kids 22 Short revolver from the 1920’s.

Also I’m open to all brands but obviously a Century will have less value over a Saiga.

I also plan to include the original stock, buffer tube, buffer, I believe I have a bipod that mounts on the rail and a pair of scope rings as well that Iwill include.

Lastly, I will not part out the rifle to sell or trade 1 little piece but however I might consider selling just the upper and keep the lower but I will not sell just the lower.

I will also consider trades for a 7.62 Battle Rifle like a FAL or M1A/ M14 type rifle."

Lever-action BB rifle holds 650 BBs. All-day fun! This rifle is NOT designed for a scope. 
0.177"" 350 ft/sec 

Now has a metal cocking lever.

The legendary Red Ryder! Who hasn't wanted one of these? Daisy's 1938 Red Ryder model is still a favorite of boys and girls (and men and women). Suitable for shooters 10 and older (with adult supervision), this lever-action spring rifle is lightweight, easy to cock and durable. The solid wood forearm and engraved wood stock are just the right length for young shooters.

With a capacity of 650 BBs (Never shoot BBs at hard objects!), you'll be shooting all day long! The rifle comes with a blade and ramp front sight and an adjustable open rear sight. It has a stamped metal receiver.

This rifle is perfect for plinking, shooting paper targets and for training new shooters. The Red Ryder is intended for shooting targets UP TO 5 meters away...about 16.5 feet! Safety glasses for the shooter and everyone else in the vicinity are necessary, as BBs can bounce back.

Shoots 9mm pistol rounds.  Cheap.  Reloadable.  Also eats up +P and 147gr. subsonics.  If your county allows it, would be a perfect SBR or port the barrel for an integral suppressor.  See youtube for examples.

Folding stock locks solidly into place open and also latches into the barrel shroud when closed.

http://www.eberlestock.com/introducing_the_skycrane.htm

Eberlestock backpacks have earned an outstanding reputation for being extremely well made and highly functional, with absolutley bombproof construction.  The Skycrane pack was designed for military sniper use in the field, but also works great for hunting, backpacking, as a Bug Out Bag, or many other uses.  The internal frame and generous padding means even heavy loads can be carried comfortably.  

It's modular, and can be transformed from a 2600 cubic inch 3 day pack (similar to the Eberlestock Gunslinger packs) all the way up to a 7500+ cubic inch gear hauler and back, just by attaching or removing the various modular components.  It also allows you the option of carrying a full length rifle in the detachable scabbard, concealed and protected from the elements, with the weight of the rifle distributed through the pack frame.  The pack can even be unfolded into a shooting pad.

The backpack is lightly used and complete.  *This IS NOT one of the ""smoke/water damaged"" Eberlestock packs that were sold on clearance after the Eberlestock warehouse fire in 2010.*  No damage, markings, stains, or tears.  Never used in the field, but was packed with gear and sat in my closet for over a year.  Comes with all of the original Skycrane modular parts, including the Spike Camp Duffel, MOLLE shooting pad insert, padded waist belt, removeable buttpack, and removable rifle scabbard with matching scabbard cover.  I can provide additional photos through email on request.

Also includes additional new Eberlestock accessories: UNICAM (digital Multicam variant) lightweight rain cover, four large accessory/compression straps in OD Green, spare coyote brown MOLLE rifle scabbard, and spare coyote brown scabbard cover.

865,http://www.armslist.com/posts/166865,For Sale:  Lee- Metford,"Madison WI, Madison, Wisconsin","$ 1,200","Listed On: Sunday, July 24, 2011",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am NOT a gun person, I had this gun handed down to me, I have two of these guns for sale, I talked to a few gun collectors and they told me what it is and the history and what they are worth. I will be happy to send more detailed pics or info that is asked. the 10 round clip is missing. 


GENERALLY:  The Lee-Metford, entering service at the very end of the black powder era, is the most modern military rifle that was ever built to use black powder.  In fact, like the M1888 Austrian Mannlicher, it was developed as the search for a suitable smokeless propellant was going on in Britain and all across Europe. 

The Lee-Metford is a box mgazine fed, rear-locking, bolt action repeating rifle in the classic British .303 calibre, but loaded at the time of its adoption with black powder. A smokeless cartridge was introduced in the early 1890s and Enfield rifling began to replace Metford with the adoption of the Lee-Enfield in 1895. The Lee was designed by James Paris Lee of Illion, New York (the city of Remington fame) and substantially improved and perfected at Enfield. It utilized a box magazine system also developed by Lee coupled with a barrel and rifling system invented by William E. Metford. The Lee/Metford/Enfield combination began the long line of successful rifles (substituting Enfield rifling when Metford rifling was unable to tolerate the later smokeless cartridge heat and pressures) for Britain, continuing into the 1990s. 

The period of the Lee-Metford magazine rifle, adopted in 1888, overlapped the service life of the last of the Martini-Henrys, the Mark IVs. In the late 1880s the British were studying repeating rifles as well as searching for improvements to the entrenched Martini-Henry. This led to the adoption, perhaps prematurely, of the .402 Martini-Enfield in 1886 and an ""improved"" version, more like the Martini-Henry, in 1887. But the soon expected Lee-Metford, in .303 calibre, would have created logistical nightmares, thus the Martini-Enfields were withdrawn and the bulk of them converted to Martini-Henry Mark IVs. 

The most notable feature of the then very modern Lee-Metford was it's detachable box magazine which could be loaded, either detached or mounted, initially with up to 8 cartridges (The Mark I and Mark I*) and later with as many as 10 (the Mark II).   The Mark II* (not shown) is Britain's first purpose-built smokeless powder rifle and is essentially the Lee-Metford with Enfield designed rifling, thus the ""Lee-Enfield"" of world-over fame.

DISTINGUISHING CHARECTERISTICS:  Rear locking, bolt-action, magazine fed repeater with two-piece stock, the butt of which is screwed into a receiver ring mounted below the bolt handle and at the back of the trigger guard. there is an indentation on the right side of the stock just above the magazine to aid in grasping the magazine cut-off located just above it. Generally, crown, V.R. manufacturing markings, year and mark are found stamped on the right side of the receiver ring. The rifle has both a safety, on the cocking piece, and a half-cock bolt position. The entire bolthead and bolt body is protected by a dust cover. Rifling is Metford segmental of seven grooves and is comparatively shallow. On the left side of the forestock is a long range sight (volley sights) in the form of a dial with a revolving pointer extending back, which, when rotated counterclockwise, rotates upward and is used in conjunction with a circular hole in the aperture sight which is raised to its upward position. The rifle was also fitted with a handguard which covered the barrel between the receiver and sight."

Thanks

GENERALLY:  The Lee-Metford, entering service at the very end of the black powder era, is the most modern military rifle that was ever built to use black powder.  In fact, like the M1888 Austrian Mannlicher, it was developed as the search for a suitable smokeless propellant was going on in Britain and all across Europe. 

The Lee-Metford is a box mgazine fed, rear-locking, bolt action repeating rifle in the classic British .303 calibre, but loaded at the time of its adoption with black powder. A smokeless cartridge was introduced in the early 1890s and Enfield rifling began to replace Metford with the adoption of the Lee-Enfield in 1895. The Lee was designed by James Paris Lee of Illion, New York (the city of Remington fame) and substantially improved and perfected at Enfield. It utilized a box magazine system also developed by Lee coupled with a barrel and rifling system invented by William E. Metford. The Lee/Metford/Enfield combination began the long line of successful rifles (substituting Enfield rifling when Metford rifling was unable to tolerate the later smokeless cartridge heat and pressures) for Britain, continuing into the 1990s. 

The period of the Lee-Metford magazine rifle, adopted in 1888, overlapped the service life of the last of the Martini-Henrys, the Mark IVs. In the late 1880s the British were studying repeating rifles as well as searching for improvements to the entrenched Martini-Henry. This led to the adoption, perhaps prematurely, of the .402 Martini-Enfield in 1886 and an ""improved"" version, more like the Martini-Henry, in 1887. But the soon expected Lee-Metford, in .303 calibre, would have created logistical nightmares, thus the Martini-Enfields were withdrawn and the bulk of them converted to Martini-Henry Mark IVs. 

The most notable feature of the then very modern Lee-Metford was it's detachable box magazine which could be loaded, either detached or mounted, initially with up to 8 cartridges (The Mark I and Mark I*) and later with as many as 10 (the Mark II).   The Mark II* (not shown) is Britain's first purpose-built smokeless powder rifle and is essentially the Lee-Metford with Enfield designed rifling, thus the ""Lee-Enfield"" of world-over fame. 

PHOTO:  The rifle shown in the above photo is a Lee-Metford MkI* 

DISTINGUISHING CHARECTERISTICS:  Rear locking, bolt-action, magazine fed repeater with two-piece stock, the butt of which is screwed into a receiver ring mounted below the bolt handle and at the back of the trigger guard. there is an indentation on the right side of the stock just above the magazine to aid in grasping the magazine cut-off located just above it. Generally, crown, V.R. manufacturing markings, year and mark are found stamped on the right side of the receiver ring. The rifle has both a safety, on the cocking piece, and a half-cock bolt position. The entire bolthead and bolt body is protected by a dust cover. Rifling is Metford segmental of seven grooves and is comparatively shallow. On the left side of the forestock is a long range sight (volley sights) in the form of a dial with a revolving pointer extending back, which, when rotated counterclockwise, rotates upward and is used in conjunction with a circular hole in the aperture sight which is raised to its upward position. The rifle was also fitted with a handguard which covered the barrel between the receiver and sight."

Built around Beretta’s latest Px4 modular technology, the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower.

Available in two calibers (9mm and .40 S&W), the Px4 Storm Sub- Compact uses a very reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more compact and lighter weight system. A stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion resistant, perfectly suited for concealment close to active, perspiring bodies.

The pistol adapts to different hand sizes easily with interchangeable backstraps (included). An ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. A reversible magazine release button can be mounted on either side and can quickly be replaced by a smaller and larger size button (optional). An interchangeable slide catch can also be replaced with an optional low-profile configuration. A standard Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD- 1913) allows for an array of aftermarket accessories.

Px4 User Manual

TECHNOPOLYMER FRAME. 
The extensive use of reinforced  fiberglass technopolymer has allowed the development of a  light and technically advanced firearm with a modern line that is extremely attractive and ergonomic. The technopolymer is also completely resistant to corrosion and guarantees color consistency for years to come. The rounded surfaces of the pistol are truly snag-free and facilitate the insertion and the extraction of the pistol from the holster. Also the trigger guard is rounded to ensure, when firing with two hands, the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard, underneath the barrel, a Picatinny rail (MIL Std 1913) is located. Integral to the frame, it allows the mounting of laser devices, flash lighters or other types of accessories.





ERGONOMIC AND MODULAR GRIP.
The correct grip angle allows for instinctive aiming of the firearm, automatically providing the line of sight. The rear upper part of the grip is curved and slightly recessed to snugly accommodate and protect the shooter's hand. Both the front and the rear part of the grip boast a comfortable scaled surface that, not only has great aesthetic impact, but considerably improves grip, even in moist conditions. In addition, the pistol may be adapted for different hand sizes, even small hands, thanks to a new patented system that allows the interchangeability of the back-straps by thickness and configuration: in addition to the standard back-strap (medium), a slim back-strap is also available for small hands as well as an oversized one for large hands.

AMBIDEXTROUS AND INTERCHANGEABLE MANUAL SAFETY LEVER.
The manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for equally as easy access by right or left-handed shooters.
The model G has a hammer de-cocking lever that can be replaced with another in a low profile configuration (Stealth) to further reduce the overall dimensions of the slide.

REVERSIBLE AND INTERCHANGEABLE MAGAZINE RELEASE BUTTON.
The newly designed magazine release button can be mounted on the right side of the firearm, for use by left-handed shooters. The knurled surface improves grip. The standard button can be easily replaced in different sizes (Large and Combat), suitable for professional use.

INTERCHANGEABLE SLIDE CATCH.
The slide catch (slide stop) may be replaced by another in a low profile configuration (slim type).

REMOVABLE AND INTERCHANGEABLE TRIGGER MECHANISM.
The trigger mechanism of the Px4 Storm pistol has been designed as a unit that may be extracted without the need for special tools.
The removal of the trigger group allows an easy access to the firing mechanism for cleaning and special maintenance purposes. Qualified personnel can remove the trigger mechanism when necessary, even in the field.

ROTATING BARREL.
The model Px4 Storm pistol uses the rotating barrel locking system that provides robustness and long-life, even when using powerful calibers. Further enhanced, the system boasts extremely robust locking lugs, located at 180° in order to ensure the best distribution of locking forces when firing. The reduced friction areas between the barrel and the slide, as well as the central block, guarantee a remarkable fluency of operation and great reliability, even under poor climate conditions. In addition, the barrel features an enlarged external muzzle diameter that ensures a precise and constant barrel-to-slide coupling, shot after shot, considerably enhancing the accuracy of the pistol.
Furthermore, the reduction of the external barrel diameter for its remaining length guarantees an improved rear and forward travel of the slide during the operating cycle.

NEWLY DESIGNED SLIDE.
The sides of the slide are smoothed and snag-proofed easing the insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The double transversal serrations (back and rear) on the slide allow for a firm grip even in moist conditions, facilitating slide operation and safety controls.

LOW BARREL AXIS POSITION.
Thanks to the direct barrel-slide locking system and to the design of the slide itself, the barrel axis comes as close as possible to the theoretical axis of the arm that handles the pistol with the clear benefit of minimizing the muzzle jump when shooting and improving the speed of aim in fast follow-up shots. 

LUMINESCENT SUPERLUMINOVA® SIGHTS,  INTERCHANGEABLE.
The high definition 3-dot sight system sports white indicators treated with Superluminova®, a special photosensitive material that makes them extremely visible even in darkness. A few minutes of exposure to light, even artificial light, are enough to ensure long lasting luminescence to the dots.The rear and front sights can be removed for replacement with other types.

SKELETONIZED HAMMER.
The weight of the hammer has been significantly reduced and features a distinctive look and high percussion speed.

AUTOMATIC FIRING PIN BLOCK SAFETY. 
The Beretta Px4 Storm pistols have a blocking device that prevents forward movement of the firing pin, unless the trigger is completely pulled.

Stock description from Sniper Central: “The stock is a HS Precision stock that is actually a little different than the 700P and Varmint Synthetic (VS) stocks. The most noticeable difference is that the milspec stock has a green speckling over the black and while visually it is hard to even notice, it does provide some added gripping friction while in use, and yet it is another unique thing to help the milspec be a little different than the normal Remington. … All in all, I have always liked the 700P stock and this one is just slightly different and I find it just as nice.”"

""Routers don't get any bigger and tougher than this Hitachi workhorse. It has the solid construction, horsepower, and features we've come to expect in a top-of-the-line router. Its heft goes a long way toward eliminating vibration, working with the soft-start motor to cut out torque at startup. Despite its nearly 12 pounds, it actually handles as well as most 3-1/4-horsepower routers we've tried in freehand applications. It has a 1/2-inch collet and a wide sub-base opening, making it suitable for working with all but the very biggest panel bits. It features electronic variable speed, so the router makes clean cuts in a wide range of different materials. We found the controls to be within easy reach of the handles, and though this isn't the quietest router we've used, it comes pretty close. We like the unique eight-position handles that let the tool be adjusted to the worker rather than the other way around. While this is a topnotch plunge router, it's also an excellent choice for table mounting, and many people choose this model for exactly that reason. This is an all-around solid tool that offers more bang per buck than many competing models. ""
