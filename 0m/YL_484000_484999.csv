Here's more info...

With the rising costs of centerfire ammunition, the new Tactical .22 rimfires are meant for recreational shooters, as well as those searching for a cost-effective training platform, according to Mossberg.

Taking cues from Mossberg's 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 18-inch barrel to a quad rail forend, allowing the operator to fit the rifle with lights, lasers or other tactical accessories. Two stock configurations will be offered in this series: a six-position adjustable and fixed stock. The six-position polymer stock adjusts the length of pull from 10 3/4 inches to 14.5 inches to accommodate youth and smaller-framed shooters, as well as adults.

The fixed-position stock has a standard 13-inch LOP. The Tactical .22 is integrated with an A2-style carry handle and an adjustable rear sight aligned with a front-post sight.

The Picatinny handle mount is included, allowing versatility in scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the AR-style sights. Other features included with the Tactical .22 are sling mounts and a 10-round magazine."

Ehud was an Old Testament special operator that worked in a truly non-permissive environment.  He was able to get his weapon past very high level scrutiny to carry out his mission.  If he were alive today and carrying a modern pistol, he'd have it holstered in this rig.

This is an Inside the Waistband Appendix Holster.  It makes concealed carry very easy and yet is the fastest holster we have ever worked with.   

The Ehud Holster for Appendix Carry!!! A carefully designed A/C IWB holster with maximum concealment and comfort in mind, the Ehud is like no other of its type. A product of prayer the Ehud A/C IWB Holster can be used with tucked shirt fully covering the weapon or untucked shirt for very fast presentation and ease of conceal-ability. The J-hook belt loops allow you to position your handgun just where you need it. This holster is made with a rearward cant for Appendix Carry but can be customized for any configuration; the butt of the weapon will sit approximately 3/4 "" to 1"" higher then the belt line depending on the weapon allowing a full index of the handgun.

NOTE ON HOLSTER LENGTH - The holsters all come in one standard length for a given pistol model.  So for example, a holster made for a Glock 17 will fit a Glock 19, and a Glock 26 as well.  If you order a Glock 26 holster, you will get the standard holster that fits all 9mm/40 cal Glocks, and not a short Glock 26 specific holster. We do not make short length holsters for short barreled Glock pistols.  We have found that appendix carry requires a longer holster body for stability in the belt.

Some bluing is worn off the barrel, a thread protector on the top of the receiver is stuck (scope still solidly mounted with 3 mounting holes), extra set of holes drilled on the top, and Lyman sight doesn’t align perfectly with side mounting holes (solidly held in by one screw). Otherwise it’s in great shape. All of the above can be corrected if desired, but none of these issues affect rifle function. Should make a great hunting rifle, but I have no use for it.

Not the first owner. I have 64 rounds through it. Very accurate with both scope and peep sights.

The first Onyx - as the name suggests - had completely black metalwork. The action is machined from a solid block of steel with no protrusions through the bottom of the action.  The barrels hinge into the action on stub pins or trunnions in each side of the action wall, and lock up is achieved by a U-bolt protruding through the action face. These engage in corresponding holes in the breech face of the barrels.  The action walls also have cut outs that the barrel fences engage with, thereby producing a very strong closure.

Woodwork is fairly plain yet functional with this gun. The wood has been treated to a thick gloss polyurethane type finish. The traditional-looking chequering is certainly machine cut but in spite of that the points and diamonds are very neatly cut. In fact they're extremely precise.  The stock is finished with a black rubber recoil pad of about 3/4in thickness, which feels comfortable and does help soften the recoil when heavier cartridges are used in the gun."

All that is mounted to an AR15 handguard rail that was drilled and mounted to the pump handle with hex bolts. The barrel has shot about 400 rounds of mostly target loads.

I am also open to selling the MESA Adapter Kit separately. I picked it up with the intention of adding an optic (Hence the empty scope mount on the rail shown) to my 590 but never got around to it. The Adapter and optics rail was $160 new and the MESA 6 round Side Saddle was $55 new. The Mil-Spec Stock tube was about $20, the KZ Ambidextrous Rear Sling Plate was about $15 and the MOE grip was $20. Overall that's over $260 worth of stuff.

I'd be willing to sell it all together for $220.
All MESA components will come with the original packaging.

Also trying to sell a MOLLE Load Bearing vest. 
It comes with 3 x AR15 magazine pouches (hold two each) and one has two elastic loops for shotshells. Also, 2 x Frag Grenade pouches. The vest is adjustable for girth and height and has loops for a pistol belt. Molle webbing is used to attach more pouches that use the PALS system.

I reduced the price from $1200 to $800 so I can get it before he sells it to someone else. Just the furniture that comes with this gun was more than $300. It has a new bolt carrier, bolt, new pins, new cocking tube and operates flawlessly. I need to sell this as soon as possible, absolutely no trades as you can see my predicament and I stand firm at $800 as I am loosing money on this gun. Comes with 20 or so mags cases for the mags 2 scope mounts sling multiple stocks and tons more, including replacement parts.

Nosler Ballistic Tip Hunting bullets have been trusted by hunters for nearly 25 years. They are precision made and individually inspected for the utmost quality which translates to incredible accuracy with every shot. The heavy jacket base prevents bullet deformation during firing and holds together at extreme velocities as well as a polycarbonate tip that resists deformation in the magazine and initiates expansion upon impact. The bullet's mid-section keeps it together at any velocity until impact, and a uniform, pure lead core eliminates possible imbalance and erratic flight caused by air pockets. Great for thin-skinned game like deer, antelope and sheep. This is not loaded ammunition.

It's had the feed ramp polished, the barrel has been polished, it's got an aluminum trigger and hammer, both polished, beavertail safety, extended thumb safety, Ed Brown hardcore extractor, and it's been very reliable. 

I've put a few hundred rounds through it, and it's a pretty accurate firearm. Occasionally will jam, but seems to be due to cheap magazines. It comes with 1 Wilson Legendary magazine, 5 Chip McCormick magazines, the one that it came with and two off brand ones for a total of 9. I have not had a problem using the Wilson or Chip McCormick magazines, especially the standard 8 round ones. 

I can also throw in a leather holster. 

If you're looking to get a nice affordable 1911 this is the one for you. It's got a lot of newer, custom parts to it, comes with 9 mags, snap caps, extra custom grips and a holster. So I'm pretty firm on the price, I'll also consider trades. Just let me know what you got.

Email for more details about the revolver.
Your 12GA Browning barrel can be standard or vent rib. Length does not matter. I prefer a blued finish but matt finish is OK. You send your barrel and I'll send my revolver. Again, this is a TRADE, no money is involved.

Tack driver to say the least...I have shot it at 400yds with and shot as well as I can see or shoot....certainly a longer range rifle than that with the right optics and shooter.
I have sold custom AR's in the past an unfortunately you get a lot of questions from folks that think they know why they are talking about but they don't .
Things like ""what manufacture? Who makes that? Etc."" this is a custom built rifle using FN parts in the upper and a composite Plum Crazy lower (chose the composite lower to offset the weight of the bull barrell . If you prefer a metal lower I can move it to an SOG for a little price increase but personally I would leave it on the plum crazy)
If you don't know much about AR's and would like me to walk you through it I am happy to but the questions for know it alls (that don't) get irritating.
I don't know everything about them either but guys that are looking for one a few name brands because that's what try heard is good???
These are mil spec the major moving parts (upper receiver, lower,barrell, etc ) are for the most part same same and most from one of a few foundries...if you ate asking about manufacturers know about manufacturers is all I'm saying."

It comes directly from the Izhmash factory in Russia.  This is a REAL Russian made AK-47, in a semi-auto, sporterized, version.  It was built new and fitted all at once in the actual Russian factory. (The same factory and craftsman that build AK-47s for the Russian military).
   Contains NO used/worn military surplus parts from other countries. This rifle is LIKE NEW, ALL ORIGINAL, with MATCHING serial numbers.  
  This Saiga is ""unconverted"".  It does NOT take standard AK mags (yet).  It can easily (legally) be altered into the original military configuation (semi-auto version) to use standard AK mags and drums.  It only takes a few hours work.  Parts for conversion are inexpensive, and available on line.  There are step by step instructional videos on Youtube.  
   This is the same Saiga rifle that Arsenal uses to convert back to standard AK form for around $900.
   Rifle has chrome lined bore/chamber for excellent corrosion resistance and durability.  Chrome also makes cleaning quick and easy.  There is a solid, factory installed, scope mount base on left side of reciever. 
   Comes with Dragunov style stock with adjustable cheek piece ($100 value) and standard hunting style stock.  Also come with one 10rd Saiga mag, and one 40rd steel AK mag.
  (Also, I have the ATI conversion stock set, new in box, which includes 6 possition SIDE FOLDING stock, forarm with bottom & side picitiny rails, and handgaurd with top rail.  I've got $120 in the stock set plus shipping.  I'll sell it along with the rifle for $80 additional.  Or $100 alone.)
   Q.  Will this type of rifle have a huge jump in price as the electon gets near???  Who knows?  Last election they about doubled in price.
If you've been wanting to get one... this might just be the time.
   My price is only a few dollars more than SKS prices.  Very low round count.  Never fired corrosive ammo.

540,http://www.armslist.com/posts/484540,Want To Buy:  So you want to buy a suppressor?,"Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 24, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"If you can LEGALLY purchase a firearm, you may purchase a supressor.

Suppressors, like machine-guns, are regulated under the National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934, and are regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

STEPS REQUIRED TO PURCHASE A SUPPRESSOR

1. The first step is to locate a Class 3 dealer.

2. The Class 3 dealer will provide the prospective purchaser with duplicate ATF Form 4's and two sets of fingerprint cards.

3. The Form 4's must be filled out on both sides, with passport photos of the prospective buyer affixed to the backside of the form.

4. The buyer then has the Chief Law Enforcement officer sign the rear of the Form 4's attesting the prospective purchaser does not possess a criminal record and is not wanted.

5. The two fingerprint cards must be completed and signed by a Law Enforcement agency.

6. The completed paperwork is then sent to the Department of the Treasury with a check or money order for $200.00. The $200.00 is known as a ""transfer tax"" because it must be paid whenever ownership of the silencer is ""transferred"" (in this case, the dealer to the prospective purchaser). As long as ownership remains with the same person, the tax need not be paid again. Only if the owner sells it will a new transfer tax need to be paid. An owner may will his suppressor to a lawful heir with no tax incurred.

7. Once the paperwork is submitted, it normally takes 60 to 120 days to receive the approved, stamped paperwork from the NFA Branch. It is only upon the return of the approved paperwork that the dealer can allow the prospective purchaser to take possession of their new suppressor.

8. A copy of the approved paperwork must accompany the suppressor at all times (the original should be stored in a safe deposit box).

9. Suppressors can be transported to other states that allow their ownership, but to transport a suppressor into one of the states which prohibit private ownership can subject the owner to serious state felony charges."

The only issue it has - it is picky about which mags it uses.  Stick to Mec-Gar and or Wilson Combat and you are fine.

Used as ccw for the past 7 months. I have shot about 250 rounds through it. It was bought by me brand new. Excellant gun, very accurate and easy to conceal. All metal frame and slide. Top notch craftsmanship. I have never experienced any kind of FTF/FTE. I liked it so much I bought a KP45 to ccw. If you like 9mm, you will not be disappointed.

For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. 

Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling. 

The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. 

The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage).

Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs. 

The Bushmaster A2/A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are shipped complete with 30 round magazine, safety and operational manual, and carry sling."

11 daylight settings provide a visible aiming solution through a full range of light conditions. Power is supplied by one 3V CR2032 Lithium Battery, providing an average of 8000 hours of operation.

This is an excellent example of a well-built AK/RPK!

The Norinco NHM-91 is the Chinese sporter variant of an RPK light machine gun. It features a heavy 20"" double chrome-lined barrel, extra thick 1.5mm steel receiver, threaded barrel (with thread protector) and barrel mounted bipod. Chinese manufactured AKs are some of the highest quality imported AKs, and this is no exception! The rifle is well built and has the smoothest action of any AK I've owned and is a great shooter! The heavy barrel and long sight radius makes it capable of accuracy typically unheard of in the AK world.

All numbers matching, original bipod, wood Bishop thumbhole stock and one Norinco magazine. The wood is in excellent condition and the blueing of the receiver and barrel is very good. There are a couple minor scuffs in the finish. This AK is [b]100% rust-free[/b]. It is a pre-ban rifle, dating back to before 1994 when the import of Chinese firearms were banned. This is a collector's AK!

The NHM-91 uses standard handguards and a standard pistol grip and butt stock could be swapped if desired.

Includes everything pictured: the AK, one magazine, a Bob Allen soft case and 360 rounds of Wolf ammo.

Ive got the XDM gear kit, 2 mags as well as an extra blackhawk Serpa holster. Willing to throw a few $$ in if you have a 5.25"" to help offset the cost difference.

I can also add some 9mm target ammo for the right gun.

I love the XDM platform, but the 3.8"" isn't the best gun for shooting competitions, which is what I am mostly doing now so looking for some more barrel length.

Would also sell for $525 obo outright if I cannot find a trade.
