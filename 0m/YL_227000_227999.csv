Zombie Blood Gun Oil is our first product being put out to the general public!  Made up of the highest quality blend, our product is the most versatile gun oil you can buy. It prevents large amounts of dirt and grime from building on exposed metal surfaces while displacing moisture from metal pores. Our product also protects internal and external metal parts from rust and corrosion. This exclusive formula provides a thin, long-lasting film that keeps actions working smoothly by reducing metal-to-metal wear.

When you apply Zombie Blood Gun Oil to your fire arm the first thing you will notice is the absence of friction. All you feel is spring tensions in the weapon. It works in incredible extremes, from desert warfare to sub-arctic temps. It also does not attract grime or dust. You will not find a better firearm lubricant bar-none. When Zombie Blood is used it is even easier to clean the weapon after long hard use. 

Zombie Blood Oil reduces wear and extends the life of firearms. It adheres well and is safe for use on all varieties of metal-to-polymer and metal -to-metal firearms. 

Great for use on your bolt, rails on semi-automatic weapons, inside the locking lug area, and inside the bolt carrier areas where carbon builds.  Most of the time you will simply wipe the areas clean (mostly we at Zombie Blood use Q-tips).

High viscosity oil refined to perfection for use in firearms, fishing reels and other precision mechanisms. Does not harden gum. Gives extra-long service. 

Technical Information:
**We at Zombie Blood have tested our product using most semi-automatic weapons, revolvers, semi-automatic riffles (AR-15 etc…) with excellent results.**

Has the updated stainless steel guide rod, new recoil springs (its a double spring) and a +1 extension. Includes about 35 rounds, I have no other .32's so you can have all of them I can find.

This gun is much nicer to shoot than a factory P32, the steel guide rod / new springs really make it much more crisp and cycle quicker and the stippling and mag extension make it a whole heck of a lot easier to hang on to. Also the trigger on these have a little ridge that irritates the shooting finger, mine has the ridge removed so you dont get that rubbed raw feeling inside your joint."

Super Carry pistols have highly refined features like night sights with cocking shoulder, Carry Melt™ treatment for rounded edges that will not cut or snag and special beveled slide serrations for positive operation.

Custom Shop enhancements include recessed slide stop pin with surrounding bevel, high cut under trigger guard for better recoil control and aggressive front strap serrations that ensure a positive grip regardless of conditions.

Round heel frame configuration makes Super Carry pistols easier to conceal and more comfortable to carry. Serrated mainspring housing welds grip to palm, encouraging fast sight picture recovery between shots.

The Super Carry family was designed with a single purpose, to be the finest concealed carry pistols available today. Night sights, ambidextrous thumb safety and match grade trigger group are standard. Stainless steel slides and light weight aluminum frames wear KimPro II, a proprietary high-tech finish that is self-lubricating and extremely durable. The Super Carry Custom has a 5-inch stainless steel match grade barrel, the Super Carry Pro has a 4-inch bull barrel and the Super Carry Ultra has a 3-inch bull barrel plus a frame with shorter grip. Super Carry pistols combine dynamic style with outstanding quality and performance – just what you expect from Kimber.

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. Two finishes are available; Two-tone and corrosion resistant Nitron. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters. From the very beginning of the design and development, computers have been used exclusively. All machined components are also made on modern high speed computerized equipment.

The P-32 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

These are both Generation 3 guns. One of them has a set of Trijicon night sights, the other has standard Glock sights. I am putting them both up for sale. Whichever one sells, I'll keep the other one. 

Glock stopped making the RTF (rough textured finish) models last year. They were only made for a short time. Both of these also have the ""scalloped"" or ""fish-gill"" slide serrations. These were made for a shorter amount of time than the RTF frames. The last RTF framed pistols came with standard Glock slides.

Both of these guns come with two factory 15 rd mags, box, lock, loader, etc. that they came with from the factory. Neither of these guns has more than 200 rounds through them. They are spotless, nearly impossible to distinguish from new.

I had no idea the RTF's had become so hard to come by. I was trying to find a 17 RTF a few weeks ago and they're no where to be found. The price of the RTF models has taken off in the past several months.

I'm a Certified Glock Armorer and have been through both of these guns, they're 100% ready to go.

The $459 is for the one with standard sights.  $509 for the one with Trijicon night sights installed.  Again only one of these guns will sell, I'm keeping the other one.

Looking for a straight cash sale on this, no trades."

Iron sights, but drilled for a scope. Its an Angle-Eject model manufactured in the mid 80's. In excellent condition. Ive seen lever actions in worse shape go for more at local pawn shops. It has a 6+1 magazine tube and weighs just under 7 lbs fully loaded. Its ideal use is a 100 yard brush gun for deer, however the 30-30 can reach out a lot farther with a scope.

Excellent rifle, powerful, small and lightweight, good for carrying in the feild, holds far more ammo than you should need on a hunting trip and slings a round that can take down large elk, let alone deer.

My $180 price is firm unless trades are involved. It will fire every time, but the groups are lousy.

I am planning to have the barrel re-lined by Redman's Rifling if no one wants to buy this or trade me, so I'm not desperate to get rid of it. It is in good condition otherwise. The finish is mostly gone but the gun has a nice patina. No surface rust or pitting (except inside the barrel). No cracks in the stock.

Amazon details:
Product Features

    * Solid-state, recoil-proof LED generates 120 lumens of blinding white light
    * Versatile beam with enough reach for longer-range applications and surround light for peripheral vision
    * Mounting system integral thumbscrew clamp for Picatinny rails
    * Hard-anodized aerospace aluminum, optically coated tempered window and O-ring seals
    * Ergonomic tactical switching- click on and off tailcap and pressure-activated tape switch (included)

Product Description
The M600C Scout Light attaches by means of an integral thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. Its small size increases weapon maneuverability, increases rail space available for other accessories, and minimizes added weight. It uses a high-efficiency LED emitter, virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break, and a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to create a beam with good reach and significant peripheral light for close- to medium-range applications. Maximum output is 120 lumens, and it produces tactical-level light—more than enough to temporarily overwhelm the night-adapted vision of an aggressor—for over three hours per set of batteries. The M600C has two switch options: (1) a pushbutton tailcap switch: press for momentary on, press further to click constant-on; (2) a momentary-on tape switch with a 7-inch cable that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro backing. Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for maximum light transmission, the M600C is O-ring sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture. Battle-tested, built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black or Desert Sand Brown.

PCF15 complete lowers with consecutive serial numbers.

One has about 700 round count with no problems and the other is Zero round count.

These are completely polymer lowers which shaves about a pound of weight from your rifle.

From my personal experience these lowers have a crisp pull and nice let off that is better than the Smith and Wesson M&P15 and Bushmaster.

Also, if you are able to legally build full autos you will find that these lowers are almost identical to the M16 lower which allows them to accept full auto trigger groups with no milling. But remember you should always know and follow BATFE rules!

Only reason I am letting these go is I have sold all my AR15 platform rifles and moved on to the AK platform. This is the only two items I have left for the AR15 platform.

I will entertain reasonable cash offers but would rather trade for a compact 9mm or 7.62x39 ammo. I might entertain other trades just ask.

However, concealability is a lower priority for me as I prepare for the zombie apocalypse.

The rifle is in perfect working condition and has a small purely cosmetic blemish near the ejection port from spent casings slamming out of it (which all used SIG556's tend to have). It also has the folding and collapsible stock that it came with, which is really useful for storage as it folds up nice and small. It includes 6 magazines (1 SIG 30rd magazine and 5 STANAG 30rd magazines with the non-tilt follower which are compatible.) I have also installed the SIG diopter set sight (a 140 dollar value) and have it zeroed in. All you have to do is turn the diopter (CQB, 100, 200, and 300 yard settings) line it up, shoot it and you'll hit what you're aiming at. I've gotten 8/10 hits on an 8"" gong from 200 yards STANDING. I will also include the KNS precision take-down pin that I haven't installed but replaces the second take-down screw so it becomes a push pin as opposed to a screw, making both of the take-down pins are pushpins, which means complete dis-assembly is a breeze. This thing really is a tack driver, and for a low round count beautiful condition SIG, this is a steal. Check the pictures for yourself! (note the picture was taken before I put the new iron sights on) It has a set of BUIS that are useful if you decide to put optics on the top Picatinny rail. This thing can be set up in so many different ways and tactical options. Beautiful gun. I'm asking $1000 for it, which is a great deal as the list price for this specific gun is $1,793 according to the SIG website (and that doesn't include the magazines or the sights I'm including.) Email if you're interested or would like more pictures or info and I will gladly oblige."

These guns were bored for .22 magnum (.224”) but can shoot .22 LR (.222”) with a .22LR cylinder, not included. Your greatest accuracy is with the .22mag cylinder. This cylinder is original and matches the guns serial number.

Ruger is the major player in rimfire pistols. The name “New Model” only means, a safety bar was added to the hammer contact area so the gun could be carried fully loaded, no chance of firing while not in operation. New Models came into production in 1973. Serial on this one is 67-59XXX. This gun was upgraded with the Wolff 19# mainspring allowing smoother hammer action. The gun comes with adjustable sights and the 5.5” barrel offered by Ruger. As a courtesy I am adding 4 boxes of ammo. This is not a distressed sale. I take cash, gold, silver coins-bars .... You must be 21 years old and prove residency in Alabama.

This gas operated semi-automatic packs a bigger punch than the 5.56mm/.223models – a .270 cal. 6.8mm SPC (Special Purpose Cartridge) specifically developed for the military, but now available commercially. Velocity averages a bit over 2600 FPS (with Hornady 115 Gr.V-Max), and the heavier bullet weights deliver excellent terminal energies. The 6.8 mm SPC was developed from a .30 Remington case which is shortened slightly to fit the AR15 type magazine. Due to the “fatter” case diameter, magazine capacity in a 30 Round AR type shell is reduced to 26 Rounds, and 6.8 specific springs and followers are used."

I am not sure of the round count as I got the gun used but I have personally fired about 100 rounds through it. It functions flawlessly. It has an ATI Talon adjustable stock & pistol grip that has a 5 round side saddle attached to it. If you didn't want the saddle on it I do have an adjustable cheek rest that originally came with the stock.  It also has a sling attachment point as well as a soft rubber butt pad. Also installed is an ATI tactical forgrip. The forgrip has spots (left, right, bottom) that you can attach small sections of rails to. It also has a Warhammer full top rail / heat shield installed. The rail is very rugged and secures tightly to the shotgun. It has AR style adjustable/removable front and rear sights on it. Also attached is a TacStar 6 round side saddle. In order to install the side saddle along with the Warhammer i had to grind the one side of the warhammer flat so the side saddle would fit flush. With the side saddle installed you cant even tell any modifications were done. Please note that the ammo, tactical light & light mount are NOT for sale. Please feel free to email me with any questions you may have or for more pictures. I respond to email very quickly and will do my best to answer your questions.

I have $600.00 into this shotgun so please no lowball offers. As far as trades go I'm looking for a Remington 870 Tactical shotgun or a nice 1911 pistol. I can add cash if needed. If you have anything else interesting to trade, let me know."
