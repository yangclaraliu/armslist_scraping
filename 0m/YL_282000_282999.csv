I am not sure of the brands of accessories but I am sure they are fairly high quality. 

This is a tack driving custom built .22! I have only shot it a few times using the half box of 40 gr. Wolf Match he gave me with it and it was scary accurate. I am not much for the bench shooting so I don’t need to keep it. I am looking to buy some Rev War Re-enactment gear so this will help finance that.

It has a heavy bull barrel, heavy bench composite stock, adjustable flip down bi-pod, adjustable but plate and three magazines. The trigger is very sweet as well. Again, being an amateur 1911 guy, I don’t know a whole bunch about these kind of accessories.

The scope seems to be pretty nice as well. It is a Simmons Pro Hunter Master Series 6-21 x 44mm MilDot Reticle with Target Turrets MOA 1/8 Adjustments & Side Focus Parallax Adjustments with Butler Creek Flip-Up Covers and adjustable quick release mount.

He told me had had well over $700 into it and given his addiction to bench shooting I would believe it. 

I am asking $350 OBO for the entire package and if FTF I will even throw in a brick (500 rounds) of .22 ammo. I would also consider a trade for Rev War repro musket or XD-9. I prefer FTF in Upstate or Greenwood, SC but I will ship to your FFL if you cover costs."

It's had probably 200 rounds through it. 

The P238 has a reputation for two things to make people shy away. First, lots of feed and extraction issues. Second, the trigger is very heavy and often gritty. I've never had a feed or extraction issue with this pistol. It has also had a trigger job  to bring the pull down to the 4.5-5lb range. It is now a crisp release with no grittiness or over travel. It still has the low resistance pre-travel common to these guns - I thought it advisable to leave that in a carry gun. For those worried about the trigger job in a carry gun, I'll just say the trigger is now very similar to a 1911 trigger, the gun on which this is modeled. You will not fire it accidentally; more importantly, you will not jerk the gun and miss your target while fighting with the trigger. In my opinion it makes it a safer weapon. 

The pistol comes with two extra magazines, the original case and an IWB holster manufactured by Cobra.  I've had no feed issues with any of the magazines. 

This pistol is a joy to shoot. The sights are easy to acquire (unlike many of the other .380s out there), allowing you to make a ragged little group if your skills are up to it. This is not a 'snappy' gun like many of the .380s - like the 1911s on which this is modeled, the gun just pushes back softly as the slide operates.

Why am I selling? I'm moving to CA, where I probably can't get a CC permit, and so it'll probably just sit around not getting used much. .380 ammo is kind of spendy compared to my other recreational guns, so it is time to sell. 

No trades, I'm trying to pare down my collection, and get money for the move.

If you are local, I'll throw in some .380 ammo."

Model 71 Standard

Manufactured in 1941

Very Nice Condition

$1050.00

This rifle is not a museum piece, nor does it have the price tag to match. It is a collectable Winchester that can be used for hunting without significantly reducing its market value. The Model 71 is to me, the best lever action rifle ever made in a caliber capable of taking down most North American game with one properly placed shot. I have personally used it to hunt European wild boar in Tennessee and find it an accurate, reliable and powerful weapon. 

Please Note: I may have a peep site that will go with the rifle. If I find it, it will go along with the rifle at no charge. The standard model was equipt with open sites only, the peep was standard on the deluxe model.
The back screw in sling swivel is missing. This is a common part.

Why am I selling this rifle? I do have a Model 71 Deluxe in my collection as well as a few other guns I use regularly and need to reduce the number of guns I own as well as raise some money for another purchase.

I will consider a partial trade for a revolver, or Ham radio equipment, working or not.

Additional Winchester Model 71 Information

The Model 71 was designed to replace at least two models (the 1886 & the 1895) with just one (the 71) and a raft of cartridges (the .33 Winchester, the .45-70, the .35 Winchester, & the .405 Winchester) with just one (the .348). In the mid-Depression period, that sort of production economy made manufacturing & marketing sense. The .348 was also given a range of bullet weights, such that, on introduction, the Model 71 was touted as ""The Universal Big-Game Rifle.""

Improvements in the Model 71 over the Model 1886

(1) Steel: Winchester Proof-steel was used exclusively in the Model 71. This is a stronger steel, and it holds blueing better than the nickel-steel of the post black powder 1886's (those made c. 1900 on into the early 1930's). Some very late 1886's have Proof-steel, but note the caveat above about earlier parts used in final Model 1886 manufacture. 

(2) Coil Mainspring: The Model 71 featured a new spring steel coil mainspring (vs. the flat mainspring of the Model 1886). This gave a smoother hammer action and decreased tension at full cock.

(3) Butt Stock: The stocking of the Model 71 (and of the Model 64) reflects the work of an NRA design team, whose leading spirit was Colonel Townsend Whelen. The aim of the stocking changes was to increase the good handling characteristics of the 1886 when used with the 71's .348 Winchester cartridge. The butt stock was made larger, with a higher comb, a higher & longer heel (which gave more pitch, which, in turn, gave more non-slip bearing surface on the shoulder). The comb was made large & well-rounded, with both the width & depth of the stock increased. Recoil effect was clearly diminished, and, like a fitted shotgun butt, rapid mounting & settling were improved. I find this to be very true when comparing my 1886 Extra Light to my 71's.

(4) Butt Plate: The butt plate design was slightly, but significantly, altered with a slight hollow and a checking pattern to help hold the butt in place during working of the lever while the rifle remained mounted at the shoulder. Again, I find this retention at the shoulder effect very marked.

(5) Pistol Grip: The pistol grip, with its short, deep curve, gives better support & positioning for the trigger hand and, so, helps increase speed in operating the lever. I personally like straight grips on two-trigger shotguns, but, with a powerful lever rifle, I much prefer the pistol grip. Compare the two and see if you don't think Whelen was right.

(6) Semi-Beavertail Fore-end: This bigger fore-end with its rounded profile helps in controlling the rise of the 71, particularly with 250-grain loads. Remember that many 71's were used in the Alaskan & Canadian backcountry in wet, muddy, & snowy conditions. Something really to get a grip on was a huge plus for the class of riflemen I shall call ""ultimate users.""

(7) Bolt Peep Sight: The 98A bolt peer sight is a very elegant and useful improvement in sighting options. Not all 71's have it.

(8) Magazine Tube Length: The ""two-thirds"" length of the magazine tube (present on some 1886's) improved overall handling, balance, & appearance.

(9) Beveled Locking Lugs: The beveled locking lugs give a useful ""pop down"" safety indicator of overloads.

(10) Machining Quality: Examine & compare for yourself. The 1935-1941 DeLuxe's are the cream of the Model 71 crop, and they represent an apogee of Winchester's attention to detail & quality in manufacturing line lever rifle production. (Please, I am speaking of production rifles - not the special crafting of ""Highly Finished Arms."")

(11) Trigger Pull: Compare for yourself. A special stoning step was added in the manufacturing process.

(12) Bow Swivels: Model 71 came with the NRA improved shooting sling, attached by quick-detachable bow swivels.

(13) The ""Jam-Proof"" Action: The feed was adjusted from the 1886 to accommodate the .348 cartridge, which feeds like the proverbial greasy sausage, even in a dirty or rusted rifle. (The Model 71's were used hard in rough conditions by back country riflemen who knew what a lever rifle should be at its best and absolutely needed to be when Mr. Grizzly burst out of the slide alders.)

(14) The .348 Cartridge Itself: The .348, as an actual using cartridge, is a magnificent design, incorporating Gerlich's advanced ideas. I pause briefly to crepitate in the general direction of the overblown ""back pressure"" arguments that have been advanced against the standard .348.

(15) Weight to Power Balance: Optimized in this magical rifle.

(16) Lyman Gold Bead Front Sight: Supplied as standard, with hood.

(17) Quality Touches Throughout"

Speaking of which, this ride gets 12-13 in town during summer, and 17-18 highway mpg. During winter in town mpg drops to about 10 with warm up. In the last 1-2 years I have replaced alot of parts, including: Altenator, battery, front calipers, rear drums, pads and shoes, rear brake springs, water pump, thermostat, heater hose adapter, intake gaskets, distributor cap & rotor, spark plugs, air filter, fuel filter, fuel pump, drivers door inner door handle, both front door door pins, the rear doors door pins, radiator, u-joints, blower motor and tires. It has a hitch and brake controller box. All the stereo speakers are aftermarket
I think that is it. I know it is alot, but it is less the new owner would have to do!! However, it seems to have ocassionally over sensitive anti-lock brakes, and a crack in the windshield, and the A/C compessor leaks freon. The truck has power everything, including rear heat & a/c, cd & cassette, cruise, tilt, power drivers seat, roof rack, running boards, towing package, daul air bags. It does have 198,000+ miles on it, but if you drive it, you would not guess it. There is a fair amount of rust showing including bottom of doors, above the windshield behind rear tires, but not rotting through. I am trying to represent this truck as best I can, the good and the bad. So if you have any questions, please ask. Call or text me. If you want more pictures, get me your email address. Asking 3,500 obo.

The gun was taped off so no paint could get to critical areas. I am willing to take $250 for this gun with all of the accessories that come with it including a hard shell case.

I also have a savage .17HMR with the bull barrel and a bushnell banner scope. It is also painted in a camp scheme. I am asking $200 for this gun. It will come only with the scope, a hardshell case and the half box of ammo I have for it.

Micro T-1, 4 MOA NVC Description
In response to the need for smaller and lighter tactical sights, Aimpoint is proud to introduce the new Micro T-1 electronic red-dot sight. Built to offer the same battleproven ruggedness as larger Aimpoint sights, the Micro T-1 is able to perform under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon.

This new compact sight is suitable for use on rifles, carbines, shotguns, submachineguns and handguns. The Aimpoint Micro T-1 is ideal as a stand-alone sight, and can also be piggybacked on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics. The Micro T-1 weighs in at only 3.6 ounces, and comes complete with a patent-pending integral Picatinny mount that is keyed into the sight body to absorb recoil.

The Micro T-1 is a 1X (non magnifying) parallax-free optic that features a 4 minute of angle (MOA) red dot for fast target acquisition. No tools are required to zero the sight, as the top of the caps covering the windage and elevation screws fit directly into holes on the adjustment screws to make the adjustment. The Micro T-1 is waterproof to 25 meters (80 feet) and tough enough to stand up to the worst field conditions. Optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices, the Micro T-1 features a manual adjustment switch with 6 night vision compatible settings and 7 daylight settings (including one extra bright setting for use in desert sunlight or with laser protection filters). Aimpoint s state-of-the-art ACET diode technology allows the Micro T-1 to operate continuously for over 5 years on a single CR-2032 battery.

It is in good overall used condition with a few scratches here and there but nothing serious.  The worst is a bit of freckling on the front sight, a scuff on the trigger guard, and a few shallow dings on the stock.  The serial dates it to 1979 so considering its age I'd say its pretty nice.  Comes with 1 ten-round factory magazine.  

It is the older version with the desirable all-metal trigger group and flat magazine release. In my opinion, the newer plastic trigger group just feels spongy and cheap in addition to being more difficult to accurize.

The scope on it is a ""Jason 4x40"" which probably needs to be sighted in as it was not done so the one time I took the rifle out to the range.  I'm selling it only because I have several other 10/22's and this one is just taking up space in my safe.

MPO ll

For the infantryman, target ranges vary in ever-changing battlefield conditions. The MPO provides a solution for engaging threats in CQB situations, then quickly transitioning to a 500m targeting or surveillance situation, and then quickly back to a 25m room clearing exercise. Instant transition is achieved through a quick Flip -to Side (FTS) mount that offers a simple, quick disconnect feature to remove the magnifier and base. This durable, night vision compatible system offers wide field optical performance with superior light transmission for visibility in extreme low light conditions.

The EXPS3-4 is configured with a new ballistic matching reticle image for the M4 carbine. The battle tested circle/dot reticle will be offered along with a series of 1 MOA aiming dots that are vertically aligned and calibrated specifically for the ballistic drop of .223 caliber ammunition. The reticle provides 4 aiming dots for target distances of 0-300m, 400m, 500m, and 600m.  The use of a magnifier is stongly recommended.  

    Aiming dots may not be distinguishable from each other without magnifcation.
    Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
    Ballistic reticle specific to .223 caliber munitions
    Compatible with Gen I-III+ Night Vision Systems (tandem operation)
    Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space

He calls me again and starts to talk about this spring needs to be replaced and this part, etc.  I tell him, hey I want to trade back, I got a lemon from him.  The GUY AGREES to this,  I drive 48 miles to meet him, he contacts me while I on the road via email to tell me he has backed out and that I have buyers remorse.

The Hunter model is one of the best selling A-Bolt II models. It also comes stocked in walnut, but of a more ""practical"" (Browning's word) grade. It features a pistol grip stock with a straight comb, sharp cut checkering, a rubber buttpad, and the same durable high gloss finish as the Medallion models. There is no contrasting forearm tip or pistol grip cap. The low-luster bluing on the barreled action is durable, detachable sling swivel bases are standard. Open sights are also optional on all Hunter rifles. This Hunter comes with a 22 inch,  barrel . The Hunter represents a fine value in a popular priced rifle."

The bore here is also in perfect shape, and has been thoroughly cleaned, decoppered etc. 

The scope is clear and has been sighted in at 100 yards for 150gr surplus. I have yet to readjust the turrets, but the mount was properly adjusted to give ample elevation changes. To evidence the quality of the work, the sighted in reticle sits center in the sight picture.

This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $100 or can be negotiated in the price. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. The barrel and gas ports have been re-worked to cycle lighter birdshot loads for which saigas typically do not cycle reliably. Please contact me by email to make a cash offer or a trade offer. Thanks.


Please do not contact me saying that you can get these at your local gun store or online for $799. Sure you can. However, they will come with a tapco stock, a tapco g2 trigger, saw pistol crip or any of those plastic parts.The stock alone on mine is a $200 upgrade. These parts can't be purchased in some kit for $200. Do not waste my time. How many saigas actually have the gas ports ported and the barrels reworked to better accept birdshot... zero. This saiga is worth much more than your average. If you want a cheap plastic conversion, spend your money elsehwere. This gun is 922 compliant as long as a US made magazine is used. If you do not believe this, I can put you in touch with the company that I purchased it from."

   This is a  striker fired pistol with a VERY smooth and light trigger pull.  It can safely be carried fully loaded, and still be ready to defend instantly.
  If you have never tried the trigger on a Kahr, you are going to be surprised at how smooth and effortless it is.  Great engineering!  
   This is an ideal CCW pistol, especially for those with medium to large hands.  (Women also find it easier to shoot well than the micro types.)  You can get all of your fingers on the grip, which increases speed on target, accuracy, and rapid follow up shots.  It is very flat in profile, making it easy to CCW.
  Gun originally cost $429 (plus tax) with only one mag.  Extra mag costs $35.  This gun comes with TWO factory 7 round mags.
  With one in the chamber, you have 8 shots ready to go, and 7 more in the spare mag, totaling 15 shots.
   Very accurate and reliable with low recoil. Excellent sights.  Around 150 rounds through it (no jams).  Its just about through the factory recomended 200 round break in period."

This thing is pristine, I'd rate it at 99% finish.  There is the faint hint of holster wear at the forward edge of the slide.  There is a slight rub mark on the top right side of the grip, and another on the grip near the master power switch for the laser.  It has a documented 265 rounds through it (25 hydrashocks and 240 WWB FMJ).

Limited time only: Shark Coast is offering a Mosin 91/30 and Tin of Ammo(440rds)for 200.00. The Mosin–Nagant M91/30 is a bolt action, internal magazine fed, military rifle invented by Russian and Belgian engineers, and used by the armed forces of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and various other nations. The Russians modernized their model 1891 rifle into what would become one of the most successful military arms the world has ever known. The Mosin Nagant M91/30 has a simple and robust design, perfect accuracy and awesome reliability. It served the Soviets well as their main battle rifle of WWII. Even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Mosin–Nagants are still commonly found on modern battlefields around the world. They are being used by insurgent forces in the Iraq War and the current war in Afghanistan. Separatists have also used the rifles alongside more modern Russian firearms in the Second war in Chechnya. Under appreciated until recently, the Mosin Nagant is one of the hottest collectibles on the market today! Arsenal refinished - hardwood. 5 rd. integral mag. Barrel: 26”, Overall: 48”, Weight: 8.2 lbs. Condition: Good. As seen in on ShootingTimes.com, April 2011 Also included is a spam can of surplus 7.62X54R surplus ammo. 440rounds Perfect Zombie Killer.
