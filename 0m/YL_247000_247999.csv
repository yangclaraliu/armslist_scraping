The Tapco trigger has been moved forward with a Tromix trigger guard, the Tromix buttstock has been properly fitted and installed, and the Tapco SAW pistol grip has been added.  It wears a Tromix flash hider.  All resulting rivet holes in the receiver have been welded closed and ground smooth, then the entire shotgun was sprayed with semi-gloss gunkote.  It has a railed handguard fitted with Troy Industries rail covers.  The optic is a very nice quality Aimpoint replica.  It is exponentially better than the garbage airsoft replicas, but not as nice as a real aimpoint of course.

It comes with one 10 round magazine that feeds perfectly.

Lets break down the costs here, not counting the gunsmithing, painting, and shipping, or taxes.

Stock Saiga S12 = $700
Tromix Buttstock = $85
Tromix Stock Plate = $15
Tromix Trigger Guard = $15
Tromix Flash Hider = $85
Tapco Trigger Kit = $25
Tapco SAW grip = $18
UTG Quad rail = $90
Troy Rail Covers = $20
Primary Arms Aimpoint Clone = $80
10 round magazine = $30


So thats about 1165 bucks in componentry.  Call a gunsmith and ask what this type of work costs. :)

Greetings, 

There was another gun identical to mine posted today. It is two ads above mine in the que and has no pictures. It reads, ""In great shape, only 20 rounds through it. Email me for pics.""

I turned down a low ball offer and apparently this person got their feelings hurt. I and my friends have responded to this add repeatedly for over 30 hours and have gotten no response - NONE. 

If you wanna run with the big dogs son, you're gonna have to get off the porch.

Regards.

Ruger Super Red Hawk 454 Casull 7""

This is nice revolver. Timing and lockup are perfect. Except for a faint cylinder ring it's like new. Comes with factory OEM Hogue grip.

It hits as hard at 100 yards as a 44 magnum does at the muzzle and it's more versatile too. It also fires less powerful and less expensive 45 Long Colts, which have been effectively stopping two legged predators for over 130 years.

Gun $650

Would be interested in trades for other modern firearms - looking for a newer Mini-14, lever action 357mag or 44mag rifles or quality DA/SA 9mm handguns. But that's not set in stone.

I'm not here to make profit, I want to sell it, or use it in barter to make a SQUARE DEAL for another one. Profiteers and low-ballers can look elsewhere. If I wanted to leave money sitting on the table I'd go to a brick and mortar shop and trade there.

I value this package at $450 for trades, cash price $400. Some of the above would be an even trade, many would require cash on your end.

Chambered for the 17HMR, our popular Model 917 bolt actions zip a high-performance polymer-tipped bullet downrange at 2,500+ feet per second – that´s 25% more velocity than the 22 Win. Mag. This hot little cartridge delivers devastating on-game performance with a laser-flat trajectory. The rock-solid, super-accurate Model 917V features a heavy 22"" barrel, double bedding screws and special inletting to enhance stability and shot-to-shot consistency. Our T-900 Fire Control trigger system produces an extremely consistent trigger pull with an ultra-clean break. Included is a 4- and a 7-shot clip magazine. The rugged walnut-finished hardwood Monte Carlo stock comes with sling swivel studs. Receiver is drilled and tapped and grooved for your choice of convenient scope mounting."

It's been shot twice with surplus ammo (350rds total) and cleaned immediately. I bought the gun new so round count is 350. The only issues are had were ammo related (I had a couple of dud rounds in the Polish ammo, wouldn't shoot in my Tok either) but no other problems.

This is one heck of a fun gun and would be a very easy first SBR (takes about $40 and 10 minutes to put the folding stock back into operation after the Feds have their pound of flesh).

I bought these new about a year ago, and have never used them. I did briefly install the front sight, but then decided to outfit my AR in a different manner. I still have all of the original paperwork, warranty info, and packaging. There are absolutely no flaws or blemishes on these pieces, and they still shine bright. The MSRP on these are $91, and retail online for about $75-$77, plus shipping. This is a great deal for these sights. Here is what Trijicon has to say about their product:

Trijicon Bright & Tough(TM) Night Sights are three-dot iron sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive, they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights feature a unique shock- resistant design that is patented by Trijicon. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil. Green lamps are warranted for 12 years from the date of manufacture. Comes with the CP25F-TOOL installation tool.

These are solid and well built! For a little more than you'll spend on a hi-point you can one of the hidden jews of S&W. 
     This one comes with two mags and a Bianchi Cyclone holster... There is some finish wear and I'm not going to lie and say ""as new"" condition.. it's an older pistol but still got it! Barrel is clean in rifling is still strong. Recoil is nil in these things due actually being made out of metal. I was hoping my wife would like this but it's a little too large for her hands. I'm just looking for cash so unless it's a really sweet trade please refrain from offering me :)... I'll get some pictures posted up later tonight. Price is $300 OBO. Thanks!"

The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.
 With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.
 Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.

This is one of the first knives that RUDY RUANA ever made when he started the business of RUANA KNIFE WORKS!
This knife was taken to RUANA KNIFE WORKS Inc. and inspected 2 times by President Victor N. Hangas. Victor did state and included it in his stamped letter on business letterhead that this knife and sheath was in fact made by Rudy Ruana between the dates of 1938 and 1944. It was made before Rudy stamped his knives with the Ruana logo. The blade being cast alluminum, handle with cut Elk antlers and the handle of cast Alluminum. The blade being of Hardened steal car springs, what Rudy used when starting his Knife business. 
The sheath also being originally made at the time of the knife. The strap having a buckle instead of the common snap found on modern knife sheaths. Victor Hangas also saying the Pins used to hold the leather sheath together have not been used in decades, now using rivets. 
Also included with the knife and the LOA from RUANA KNIFE WORKS Inc. is a letter from deceased Ed Swanson who grew up with Rudy Ruana in Bonner, Montana. The letter written in 2002 stating that Ed's father bought the knife from Rudy when Rudy began the factory. Ed's father using the knife for hunting mid century and when Ed's father passed away, Ed receiving the knife. Ed then passed this knife along to a close family friend John Hinckley, who I am assisting in the sale of this knife. 
HOW OFTEN DO YOU FIND A PIECE OF HISTORY WITH FULL DOCUMENTATION OF ITS HISTORY recorded and documented by the decendent and president of the company Victor Hangas and original owner Ed Swanson? Last week, (last week of November 2011), Knife owner John Hinckley went and again spoke with Victor Hangas about the knife and getting a legitimate estimate of its true value. Victor Hangas gave a solid estimate of the area of $5000.00 because of the rarity of the knife, also because it is one of the first prototypes to what is now RUANA KNIFE WORKS Inc. Hangas said any winning bidder is free to contact him directly with any questions of the value or about the knife and sheath.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

This gun is awesome! I love my Glocks, but this HK is a work of art, tough as a brick s**thouse, and shoots beautifully. Unreal how it fits the hand.

Best way I can describe it... A Glock & a 1911 had a baby... on planet Krypton... and taught it to kickbox.

Not for sale outright, would prefer to do some trading. I'm a sucker for new toys!  :)

Tack driving accuracy - The free-floating, button rifled barrel provides for exceptional ""out-of-the-box"" accuracy in the most extreme weather conditions
Marinecote™ models - Mossberg's proprietary all-weather Marinecote finish provides the ultimate protection in extreme weather, especially near tough marine environments
Detachable Box Magazine.
