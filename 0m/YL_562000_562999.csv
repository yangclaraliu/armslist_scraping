This is a customized Mark II plated in Black Chrome by
Accurate Plating and Weaponry (Google APW Cogan Custom for plating specs, bluing is removed and the bare metal is plated in an electroless nickel base coat before the Black chrome plating is applied).  This gun has a 6 inch (4) Flute barrel (top two flutes continue from the front of the barrel onto the to the area of the ejection port before terminating.  Bottom two flutes run from the front of the barrel to the grip frame).  It is engraved on both sides of the barrel between the flutes in a floral type pattern.  It is also engraved with the same pattern and my name on the left side of the receiver as is with all my custom Ruger's.   The gun has gold (TiN, titanium nitride) plating on the following externally visible parts- Clark custom trigger, trigger pivot pin, mainspring housing assembly(backstrap), extractor, bolt stop pin, magazine release, safety button, bolt stop thumbpiece, hammer pivot pin, and the (4) grip panel screws (2 each side).  This pistol sports a New Hogue black rubber wrap around grip with finger groves.  The bolt in this gun is plated Matte shiny chrome (by APW) and wears the official Ruger black bird logo on the rear of the bolt head.  The Clark custom trigger records a 1 pound 11.7 ounce average of 6 pulls on my digital Lyman trigger pull gauge.  It comes with two magazines, one like new magazine which I test fired the gun with after the custom work was completed and one new magazine which still has the paper sticker on it that shows it is new and unused.  The original factory grip panels and factory letter accompany this sale.  The bore is excellent and it does not appear to have been shot excessively.  Being that it was made in 1983 I of course do not have the original factory box as I bought the gun in an Estate acquisition for customizing due to its superior condition at the time.  No information was on hand at the time of sale to determine who the original buyer of the gun was.  This gun is a beauty being that the black and gold plating combination really sets it off coupled with the engraving. It is durable being that two layers of plating are present and the fact that black chrome will not rust.  This is one to keep for generations to come!  I respectfully say that the weapon is priced at near my cost of the custom work involved.  I do not build these guns to get rich on them, only because it is my passion to make these guns like that which Ruger doesn't!
Please disreguard the dates on the accompanying photos as my camera datestamp was not set correctly.  It should read 9/14/2012.  Thank you."

Well, I know that if something sounds too good to be true it usually is.  After he refused to answer my calls he insisted that he could send me his Military ID.  When he finally answered my call he BARELY spoke english and made no sense.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

The challenge was to design a belt attachment that provides secure carry at the desired angle, and remain inconspicuous. With a J-Hook or C-Hook, the holster can tilt and dive; and while a pair of loops on either side or a single wide loop around the belt can provide stability, they can also advertise ""Gun!"" to observers across the room. The solution is the Galco Y-Hook (Patent Pending) premiered on our SkyOps holster. The Y-Hook grips as securely as a full loop, yet disappears to all but the most trained eye when worn on a black belt.

The SkyOps will not win the competition for easy on-and-off nor for quick draw and reholstering. But when it's all about stealth, and wearing a jacket is not an option, the SkyOps sets the standard against which all others will be measured.

Designed for belts up to 1 1/4"" wide.

Galco Holsters are made to fit the exact model of firearm listed. All new holsters will have a tight fit until broken in."

Nor the two others i have got rid of in my life did I want to, both were absolutely essential at the time because my puppy dog became sick in summer 2010 and I needed all available cash to pay for vet.  (He is fine now but at the time it was bad and to be honest they bamboozled me, if you take $2000 from me in July and two weeks later in August hes sick from the same thing/not better you can't take another $5000 from me.  ANYWAY).. I didn't want to sell those two and I don't want to sell this one now but.

It's a Savage and by every account of the word that speaks for itself.. BEAUTIFUL worksmanship, craftsmanship, fit and finish.  it feels like you're holding a few thousand dollar classy hunting rifle like a Browning A-Bolt or the like.  Wooden stock is wAAAAAAY nicer than it should be.

Bolt action, smooth as butter.  Basically I fired this JUST ABOUT enough to start the 'break in' and 'smooth in"" process but not even a 525 round box of ammo.    (Of which I shot mostly all top quality CCI ammo but admittedly tried out some Federal 525 Bulk Pack Value.).

The accuracy of this is just unreal for the rifle it is and the price.  I don't know anything about these benchrest commandos with their rimfire warrior competition rifles for the Olympic style competitions.. or even the tough guys at the range with their $1,000 barrels, 50x power scopes, custom made and fitted stocks on 10/22 actions etc. that are just soooo cool they measure their accuracy with their custom laser rulers to .01's on the targets.  REMOVING THAT $HIT from the equation, this rifle is amazingly accurate. I'm told both Savage is famous for accuracy and the price they charge for what you get, and bolt action rifles are generally most accuracy due to less moving parts.  Well this rifle must be the perfect storm because its just not funny how great it is.

It came with a Bushnell rimfire 3-9x40mm scope.  I forget what the off-the-shelf name and price of this was, its like 40 bucks.  it was AMAZING actually and I was ComPLETELY happy with it and would not have replaced it.  and if I did I was sold on Bushnell and would have bought a slightly upgraded one.  But when buying an Aimpoint Micro R-1 from MidwayUSA I had the option to buy an amazing awesome Nikon ProStaff 4-12x40mm Nikoplex scope.  This is the top of the line of their ProStaff series which is basically their most amazing value.  It's their friendliest-priced scopes from their higher-echelon down.  some of the exact same amazing important features like the fully multicoated glass and nitrogen purged gas filled insides and the optical engineering but since its not designed for delta force or sniper competition shooting its extremely competitvely priced. Nikoplex reticle is like the best little feature they secretly have- its a fine duplex reticle with thick bars on the outside and thin on the inside BUT- if you do your research, some math, and some thinking and practical application you can figure out and apply the distances between the lines as accurate BDC stadia and use excellent shooting holds.  This scope is WAAAAAY MORE SCOPE than a .22LR needs but you will NEVER outshoot this scope wth the rifle and with 98% light transmission and 12x zoom you can always see your target.  The best part is, leaving it at 4x is perfect for a TON of shooting situations... your field of view is huuuuge and the magnifcation is great and you can just fire away.


This rifle looks extremely classy and expensive and shoots even better.  And Savage reflected their past 3 years of success and sales popularity with raising their prices.  My rifle saves you that .

I am looking for a swift, smooth, speedy transaction because I need the money and someone just strung me along and burned me on an expensive AR sale , so I have to now sell my baby .22s.  If you are interested and serious please don't hesitate to contact me. But I am selling this to someone who is serious and once we agree is coming right out and getting to business, not someone who needs a week to find the money and make sure its okay to buy it before vacation and wants to use me to reduce their DESIRED RIFLES Seller's price etc..  I will be honest fair and work with you but in return i need it to happen smoothly and swiftly so I can get the money to where my dog needs it.


Rifle comes with the new Scope of course, mounted on the rings it came with, and the Nikon covers... i will also include a $75 brown soft-sided rifle case, and two magazines I bought when there was none to be found so they were $49.99 a piece.  No ammo is included but I can sell you a box or two to get you started if necessary. thanks!


In the picture, the rifle being advertised here and sold is the top one, easily identified by the wood stock and the fact it's not an AR like the one in the middle lol and not a synthetic stocked Rem 597 on bottom."

Anyways its in pretty good condition, not sure how many rounds fired, comes with one 30rnd mag, chrome lined barrel, VERY LIGHT WEIGHT, seriously feels lighter than most AR's

I'm looking for... (no particular order) 

-AR15
-AR pistol
-AK pistol
-5.45x39 Rifle
-Galil 
-M1a or FAL (I can add other guns or ammo for one of these)
-Thompson
-Decent handguns (SIG p226, p220, HK's in .45acp and 9mm, Walther PPQ, ???)
-Decent sniper styled rifle 
-Other ideas? (please keep it along similar lines as to what I've already mentioned.) 

I can add to the value with cash or ammo, I WILL NOT ADD $1,000.... maybe a hundo or two.

Trade value I would put at around $700. Wasr's are averaging $599 plus $100 for everything I've put on it (which cost more than $100). I'd probably sell it for $650 cash though. (I can include a 75rnd drum magazine as well for the right trade)"

The bolt pattern is: 6-139 (6 bolt) and the size is: 22x9.5. The tires are Nexen Rodian HP 305/40R22 114v Extra load M+S 2 ply heavy duty sidewall. These wheels were mounted on my 2002 GMC YUKON XL 4x4. Take a look at these bad boys and make me an offer. I just reduced them from $1500.00. these wheels will fit GMS Sierra, Chevy Silverado, Tahoe, Suburban, Avalanche, Escalade etc... $1200 obo... May be interested in trades, but make sure value is close or be willing to add cash."

circa 1958 model 10, 3"" barrel $350 OBO or trades. Not in any hurry to sell. If anyone is interested, shoot me an offer. Looking to sell or trade a smith and wesson .38 revolver. This is an older smith that I bought last year from a gun show. The numbers on the gun and the grips do not match and it looks like it has a different cylinder. The gun does lock up tight though and shoots great. I just took it to the range last weekend and shoots perfect. This would make a good ""beside the bed"" or ""in the car"" gun or someone that like a very reliable, dependable older smith and wesson."

Custom New Frontier Armory AR15 
1-9"" twist, 6 grooves, right hand
This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports carbine length handguards with full heat shields, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate heat. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights.
The barrel is mounted on a FORGED A2 upper receiver with built in carry handle made from certified forgings, hardcoat anodized IAW Mil Spec A8625, Type III, Class II, black per No. 37038, Table IX with nickel acetate seal, as per the Mil-spec. This upper has the newest Mil-spec A2 adjustable sights that feature finger adjustable elevation to 800 meters and more than 30 minutes of windage adjustment at 1/2 MOA per click. The upper features a forward assist and hinged ejection port cover."

I am selling my Lee Enfield No4 MkI 303 British.  I want to either get cash to finish my AR or trade for something.  I am interested in a few different things.  Hi point 995, keltec sub 2k, 308 rifle, lever actions (357/44mag), sks/ak, etc.  I am interested in rifles (if pistol cal I would prefer 9mm) but I would consider a pistol as well.  I will sell/trade my 303 and load up most/all of my 303 brit brass with my 308 tracers (Unless we agree on something different).  I shoot 6-8"" groups at 400 yards with that load with irons.  The rifle is very accurate and fun to shoot.  I have the pig sticker bayo with it. 

The only real ""issue"" with it, is that I stripped the threaded part of the front band.  So it should be replaced.  Currently I just put a small bolt and nut in to make it shootable.  Also, the mag seems to have a feeding issue (but I always shot it single shot for long range).  Anyway, I will post pics of it.  They will be current other than the front band (which currently has a nut and bolt).  It has the original leather sling attached as well.

The barrel seems to be in decent shape.  It is fairly bright.  (I shoot .308"" bullets through it and it shoots fantastic.  So I can only imagine it doing better with .311-.312"" bullets)

I know the rifle itself isn't worth a ton of money but, it along with all the ammo makes it a pretty decent deal.  I will update with how many brass and bullets I have to load for it.  I think it is right around 200+.  I will consider any and all trades.  If you are interested, throw me an offer (even if it is unreasonable.  The worst I can do is say no).  I would prefer to deal with someone face to face, but I am not against shipping.

639,http://www.armslist.com/posts/562639,For Sale:  Bushmaster AR-15 NJ-legal fully Magpul customized OD Green SOCOM M4A1 clone,"Pennington, New Jersey, United States","$ 1,400","Listed On: Friday, September 14, 2012",Rifles,Bushmaster                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This rifle started a Bushmaster AR-15 ""XM15-E2S"".  It was a Special Limited Edition for the highest volume Bushmaster distributor in the USA.  Bushmaster had few extra (3 each actually) of 3 special, limited edition Bushmaster AR15's they offered to a small FFL in southern NJ when he asked to order some rifles.  I bought this but the other two were also awesome, in fact I REALLY wanted to buy another and have a pair of rifles that were configured differently but I ended up buying one of the best.

This is a 14.5"" heavy barreled carbine.  The 14.5"" HBAR is exactly like the M4A1 carbine assigned to the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).  Unlike the M4 assigned to front line infantry troops, the M4A1 is fully automatic and designed for customization by the individual soldier.  (THIS RIFLE IS NOT FULL AUTO LET ME MAKE THAT CLEAR).  So this Bushmaster has the same style heavy barrel 14.5"".  This completely increases the accuracy, rigidity, resistance to heating up, and increased durability.  In then is finished with a combination NJ LEGAL Muzzle Brake / Compensator.  It is a copy and reconfiguration of the Muzzle device on Russian AK-74 Assault rifle.  It was designed to allow Soviet conscripted troops from across the communist empire to fire the fully automatic, 5.45 high velocity round assault rifle with minimal to bare training, and do so with high degrees of confidence and accuracy.  This muzzle brake and compensator virtually ELIMINATES any and all muzzle climb (""barrel flip"") and takes whatever recoil a 5.56 AR-15 actually had to begin with, down to none.

The carbine is then completely customized piece by piece and given a full Magpul treatment.  I am a huge Magpul fan and I also like to have my firearms looking great in addition to feeling and firing great.  We started with a HUGE upgrade at buttstock, with the Magpul Compact-Type Restricted buttstock.  a new receiver extension was installed with the CTR stock and then professionally 'permanently' pinned for NJ legal compliance.  It was pinned by the gunsmith 1-spot from the fully collapsed position.  My gunsmith is a former Army infantry combat veteran, police officer and SWAT Team member and instructor, and private security company contractor/operator having worked in both Iraq and Afghanistan multiple rotations each.  He told me that was the best spot for a fighting carbine, then produced his full-auto (hes in PA) combat / duty M16 with its upgrades and the stock was exactly the same as I was thknking/he was recommending so we did that exactly the same.

On the bck of the receiver , on the extension ""buffer tube' I also had a top-notch 'end plate' installed ... a 'CQD' Brand rear dual-sided single point multi style sling mount end plate.  Designed for several different sling styles and mounting technique/styles and also compatible with ambidextrous use.

Then I continued replacing and customizing the entire rifles furniture/etc. to make it the ultimate civilian combat carbine.  The pistol grip is the Magpul MOE with the inner storage core capability (you can buy purpose-built inner cores to hold specific things like a spare bolt, AA batteries, etc.) or do what I do, and I had a handful of spare 5.56 rounds, a spare battery for the optic, an allen wrench just-in-case, and a cleaning cloth for the optic.

I also went all the way and replaced the trigger guard with the Magpul MOE polymer Trigger Guard.  This allows the use of combat gloves in all weather, allows the use of heavy-duty-type cold weather gloves )and still get your finger in the trigger guard to access the trigger(, it smoothes rough edges of the metal trigger guard and adds to the color scheme.

Then we replaced the hand guard and added the AWESOME Magpul MOE Handguard.  I could type paragraphs on how awesome this is , heavier duty plastic so its more rugged , smoother on the hands, allows for all types of customizing... you can add picatinny rails OR Magpul accessories directly onto it, etc.  Double metal heat shield, etc.

Then it was added the Magpul MVG fore grip, the Magpul Vertical Grip which attaches DIRECTLY TO THE MOE HANDGUARD.  Awesome.  And its compatible wth the Magpul Thumbreak Method of combat carbine/rifle gripping/shootingetc.  you have to do your own research on it.  

On to the MOE handguard I added three small picatinny rails for general future use.  I have not used them yet but you could add your bright white light (a torch like a Streamlight etc.) a laser / designator, a forward slight mount (I was going to add those three options myself).


I also added the Magpul Back Up Sight , MBUS folding flip-up/flip-down combat sight on the rear of the receiver-picatinny rail.  This flips down and stays out of your optic way (if you decide to mount a red dot sight, a holographic/reflex sight, or actual scope etc.) and deploys with a SNAP up just by pushing a little on it.  Then you  can use it with the factory front sight base and shoot the iron sights.  My idea is , sight the iron sights in at the range at one distance, say 100 yds.  And your red dot sight might be sighted in at whatever distance your choice is, what you might engage the most at, 25 yds 50 yds 75 yds whateve.r Then you can shoot both depending.

OH YEAH- in addition to completely customizing this M4A1 style Close Quarters Battle (CQB) Combat Carbine with my main Magpul accessories I Did it all in Olive Drab Green. So it looks awesome.




I hate the idea of selling this.  to be short ,I haven't worked in over 2 coming up on 3 years while I recover from major back surgery.  my total disc replacement surgery was done bad, my prosthesic disc is crooked, and at the age o 31 now not only am I broke spinally but broke financially.  And I need the money.  I had it up, had some offers, decided to not sell it cause I didn't like the offers enough and really liked the rifle.  THEN I had a bunch of offers. I TOOK THE ONE who seemed the most serious and the one who said he loved the rifle and wanted it ASAP.  Then he didn't come right away to pay.  Then he said the end of the week.  Then he blew that day off and send the next day. Then today he blew it off  and that is it.  I told him i was done with him and he said, OK I'll email you on Monday and we'll talk about rescheduling (WHICH IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN)...

Well I have not worked cause of the back surgery, all money stopped, and I am broke.  That's why I am selling my rifle.  Because my heart n soul sick dog needs a trip to the vet, and some other stuff (tests ,treatment, meds, etc.) and I made a deal with this person who stiffed me time after time and had the bhalls to say to me, ""Are you driving up to meet me after I did all this work or are you a scammer"".  I never said I would drive to this person, and he asks me if I'm the scammer? NO>

So please don't attempt to make a deal with me if you're a bamboozler or looking for a mark.


It was $1100, I put $500 parts plus a few in gunsmithing charges. And by the way the rifle has basically NEVER BEEN FIRED.  The gunsmith fired it about 5 times to function check after all his work and adjusting the sights confirming the zero.  THAT WAS IT, I took it home and saved it for SHTF/Zombies. I've cleaned and oiled it a bunch over the two years i had it.. but never took it out.  So its' virtually brand new.

$1450 be reasonable and I will be, you're really making out like a bandit here."

Very low round count. 2 magazines and case included. 

This pistol is all American made in Worcester MA by the makers of the popular ""Tommy"" gun. I was told by Kahr Arms, the current owners of Auto Ordnance that this gun was built under their ownership. So, for those concerned about the past history of the AO 1911's, this is one made by Kahr. It really is a great 1911.

Just a side note, if a AO 1911 was built in West Hurley NY, it was an older one. If built in Worcester MA it was made and quality controlled by Kahr Arms. 

The slide action is very smooth and clean. Feels as good as some of my kimber and Springfield 1911's. 

I have the original plastic mil spec WWII grips and I will include the pictured cast metal U.S. Army grips. They add nice weight to the pistol and aid in recoil. This is an awesome shooter. Doesn't stove pipe or jam. Magazine flies out with ease.

The Body armor worn by our troops makes it difficult to properly shoulder a fixed stock (A2 style) weapon and quickly acquire the target, and the lighter buffers of the carbine proved too light to allow the proper kinetics for good weapons cycling.  The heavier, dead blow design of the H6 buffer solved the issue.  Also note that the 4 position collapsable stock is actually 1/4"" longer than the A2 stock when fully extended.  Which is good for you long armed skinny folks.  

Complete weapons system, all you need is the ammo.  Long list here, but better than no info at all :)  This rifle is built/designed to deliver a round out to 800m accurately and effectively.  I'm not including an optic with the kit, as an optic is a very personal item to a skilled shooter.  The BUIS is a good place to start.  I can swap the matech out for a G.I. A2 style carryhandle sight if you desire.  This is sold as a kit only.  I will not sell any item separate, though I do have some doubles of what is included, so you can ask about what you may be looking for.

The Rifle:  Configured in the M16A4 with 4 position stock, but of course is semi auto only.  
Spikes Tactical Lower Receiver with the bullet marks for safe/semi/full.  USMC Eagle Globe and Anchor emblem laser etched on the right side of the mag well.  FN made H6 Buffer (specificaly designed for the 20"" 1/7 twist rifle, so nothing is lost in the cycling of the weapon) FN tube, spring and stock, marked as such.  All mil spec parts in lower.  

The upper:  FNMI upper receiver, charging handle, barrel as well as the bolt and carrier. Barrel is of course 5.56mm, 20"" 1/7 twist, chrome lined bore and chamber, F marked front sight post (to match the flat top upper) A2 compensator.  Matech backup up rear iron sight, adjustable for both windage and elevation.  Knights Armament M5 Rail system with panels.  

Also included with the rifle are:

6 Brand new G.I. 30 round mags with the beige ""No tilt"" follower

Insight Technology M3X LED Weapons light.  Model M3X-700-A15  rail grabber rifle light.  150 lumens.  extra batteries included with kit.

U.S.G.I. Weapons record log, helps keep track of round count, sight adjustments and other notes you want to keep about your weapon/shooting

M16A2 Operators manual (also covers the basics on this weapon) U.S.G.I.

One set of Bilsom ""Quietzone"" ear plugs.  The kind that are on a string and have soft cups for insertion to auditory canal.  reduce sound by 24db.   Bright orange so you don't loose them.

Otis cleaning kit in a zippered Molle II pouch.  This kit covers both 5.56 and 7.62 weapons, so you can use it on your other toys.   The pouch is labeled ""Sniper"" 7.62/5.56.  Very neat and compact kit with lots of goodies.  Even comes with an instructional DVD, which I find very funny.  

EVERYTHING listed with this kit is brand new.  I have laser boresighted the weapon, but have not fired it.  I may run a few mags through it over the weekend if I have time.  If I do, I will clean it properly and leave the sights set on their BZO.  And no, the price does not go down if I fire it.  Only iditots stress over ""Never fired"" weapons.  Get a life.  

No Trades, cash only.

Prefer to meet Face to Face in a public place or even at a gun store.  

I have a lot more pics on my phone, so call me and I'll text them to you.  I'm not around the computer much, so emailing is almost a waste of time.

This system is for a shooter that knows what he wants and what he/she is doing.  I will not answer retard questions or cater to picture collectors.  I hope you all understand where I'm coming from on this.  Hate to sound like a jerk, but tire kickers are a waste of my time.  

Ammo/Hunting comments:  This can be used to hunt Coyote or even deer.  I would use 62gr M855 or M855a1 ammo for coyote and 77gr Black hills or MK262 for deer.  Hornady makes a good hunting round as well, but I don't remember the weight.  Walmart 55gr ammo will work, but that crap is junk and I won't use it in my weapons.  If you must use 55gr, Use PMC.  Just note that you will have to zero the weapon to the round, so mixing ammo at the range or while hunting is going to give you drastically different results.  A 62gr round leaves the muzzle at 3,200fps.

I spent the better part of a year collecting the components to this system and spent over $2,800.00 doing so.  My price is firm, so if you think you are gonna meet up with me then whiddle me down, don't bother.  if you can't afford it or have to ask the wife's permission, don't bother me.

I went out and bought this Winchester and tried shooting trap with it and sucked. I didn't get any hits so it's on the chopping block.

It's a Winchester 140. What you see is what you get. It likes heavier loads, but the really light cheap stuff didn't cycle well. It just didn't have the oomph to cycle the bolt all the way back. I don't really sell guns anymore, just trade, so I'll entertain trade offers.

I like just about all types of guns so make me an offer, just no more trap guns because it was frustrating spending the money on a trap gun and not making a single hit. I get that I'm a beginner and all, but I've never done this terrible at anything.

In all seriousness, I took this on as a project to turn into a trap gun and lost interest.  Would be interested in a Mossberg 500 or Keltec P32/P380 or something similar."

This was my Marine father's best shotgun. He passed and I want to sell it. Super clean, rarely fired. I had several gun experts look at it during the last OKC gunshow and they said it was in pristine condition. The ones that were newer were priced higher and showed too much wear and tear.
