Benchmade Model 2000 Reflex - the long discontinued original first edition version and Benchmade's largest automatic opener with a full 4"" ATS-34 steel bead-blasted blade. This was before they started adding safety locks and pocket clips to their autos. Has the ""original"" Benchmade butterfly logo with ""Bali-Song"" written inside the butterfly. Solid and opens with an authoritative ""thwack"". It was carried a bit but has never cut much and has the original factory edge. There are plenty of character marks on this and it isn't really a safe queen. Very light freckling on the blade though it's tough to see - the older bead-blasted Benchmades usually look much worse in my opinion. This one would make a great user or carry piece or something to warm the heart of an old school collector. No box, just the knife. Asking $140 cash face-to-face in the West Suburbs. If you need it shipped, then it is $150 via Paypal which includes USPS Priority Mail shipping with Delivery Confirmation and I'll eat the Paypal fees. Knife ships once the Paypal payment clears to my account. I'm open to reasonable offers if you can make a reasonable case on the knife's value - lowball offers will just be ignored."

 * Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
 * The bolt of the VZ 2008 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
 * The VZ 2008 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
 * The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ 58.
 * The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ 2008.
 * The VZ 2008 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. 
* The alloy magazine of the VZ 2008 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lb. vs. .84 lb.)
 * VZ 2008 is easier to field strip.
 * The VZ 2008 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47.

Next was the front grip pod bipod and 45 degree iron sights that allow you to turn the gun on its side and use the sights when not using optics.  I then installed the bolt catch ambidextrous extension. As well as the Anti roll trigger pin kit.  I installed a polished nickel boron coated Bolt carrier group. And a Magpul  precision rifle sniper stock.  I just finished it tonight and the gun has never been fired.  I will test fire it tomorrow and you can take ownership then.

There are a few minor dings in the wood, and a previous owner marred up some of the screws, but all of them are still removable.  It also appears to be missing a saddle ring.  Besides the cosmetic flaws it is still a beautiful firearm that is fully functional!  

I will be posting pictures sometime in the next few days, and will be bringing it to the Collectors West gun show at the Expo Center this Friday.  If you would like to meet up there to see it, that works for me.  I haven't set a price because I want to see what's out there.  I know what it retails for (granted I'm not expecting retail-level offers), and I kind of have a number in my head that I won't go below.

The full story:
Agawam Arms was located in Agawam, Massachusetts.  It was open for business from 1968 to 1971, producing a single firearm - the ""Model 68"". Approximately 15,000 of these rifles were produced. The rifle was described by a former employee as ""similar in appearance to a cross between Model 94 Winchester and a Daisy Red Rider."" The action was similar to a Martini Falling Block. It was a single-shot .22 caliber, with a dummy tubular magazine under the barrel. It was similar in concept to the Ithaca Model 49. The target market for this rifle was department store sales. The Gun Control Act of 1968 took it's toll on this rifle. Department stores stopped carrying guns for a while back in the early 1970's in an effort to be what they thought was politically correct. Sudden loss of contracts for this gun lead to it's demise. The design was eventually purchased by Savage Arms."

The gun was bought at our exchange on base, with a final sale policy. It's brand new, I have not shot it. Unfortunately, they have locks on the triggers when you are holding the pistols, so he didn't know it had a 10 or more pound pull. We had read such great reviews on the pistol, and I really thought it was the right one for me, but I am not interested in the trigger pull, whatsoever, nor am I interested in getting used to it!

 Just on here offering a service for those that are interested.
 I refinish and restore wood rifle stocks
 Everything from shotguns, to hunting rifles and pistol grips to my specialties with AK style and SKS style stocks.
 Turn around time is normally around 1-2 weeks depending on how bad the stock is or what ""custom"" look you might like.
 When I do a stock I treat it as if it were my own. 
I start out by first prepping the wood by cleaning and bleaching it. 
Next I then fill in nicks and gouges (if you want that done)sand it and then stain the stock unless you want a natural finish. I put no less then 6 coats of stain on the stocks I do. I can do any color you would like. Red, Brown, Black even custom colors Gold pearl, purple, blue, etc...
 Then I apply a minimum of 8 coats of clear. (sheen, semi-gloss, or high gloss)

 Prices start at $65 and go up depending on size of stock and condition.

(note in the picture I am letting you see the difference between a Dan wesson 357 magnum CTG [stainless] and my Smith & Wesson .38 special CTG [Blued]. not selling my Smith & Wesson please dont ask only pictured for comparison)

I have a Dan Wesson 357 Magnum 6 shot revolver that is stainless steel and I am looking to trade it for another hand gun of some sort. Im interested in other hand guns possibly some sort of rifle but mainly another hand gun I really am looking for a glock but im open to any sort of single action or double action or single/double action and im open to all size caliber rounds even the small .22lr round (please note depending on what you have I would either do straight trade or if your gun is worth more I would give cash+my revolver for you fire arm but I expect it same way from you straight trade or if mine is worth more I would expect cash in the trade) Please let me know what you have OPEN TO ALL HAND GUN TRADES EVEN THOUGH I WOULD LIKE A GLOCK DOES NOT MEAN I WOULDNT TAKE SOMETHING ELSE PLEASE TEXT ME WHAT YOU HAVE IF YOUR INTERESTED. I really do not have a cash price in mind but message me what your thinking and we can see from there what we can do I can say right not what ever I sell it for IM just gonna turn around and buy a glock or some sort of semi auto hand gun. (***REDACTED***)
Gun specs;

Can fire 357 Magnum ammo, but also can fire the less expensive less recoil 38 special round. This is pretty cool spec about the hand gun because not many guns in general can shoot more then one round, good things about this is you can carry two types of ammo and not have to carry two different guns. also for range time you can buy the less expansive .38 special round and shoot that but if you want for hunting you can buy the 357.

This gun also has a 4"" barrel. (unlike smith&wesson/Colt/Ruger, this Dan Wesson revolver has the option of having and inter changeable barrel. When this fire arm originally came out in the early 70's it came out in a kit. The kit included the fire arm and 4 different size barrels. Including the 2.5"", 4"", 6"" and the option of the 8"" or 10"" barrel [the 6"",8"",an 10"" barrels are more squared and makes the gun look almost identical to the Colt Python] Me not being the original owner of the revolver I sadly only own the 4"" barrel but you can still find these barrels on line or oder them from the Dan Wesson site. And it is very simple to change the barrels you can do it with in a matter of mins to do.)

Also I have it so you can screw in and mount a scope to it which makes this gun a great fire arm for hunting I mean 357 is already a good round but add a 6/8/10"" barrel and a scope and this becomes a great deer gun if your up for the challenge (also great for long range target and again being able to shoot 357 or 38 special allows you the option of two rounds and different recoils for different types of shooting 357 for hunting and 38 special with target rounds for shooting all day)

I know I wrote a lot so im going to stop here and end about the gun and let you know it comes with a Uncle Mikes Sidekick Vertical Shoulder Holster Cordura Black which is shown in pictures. (if you would like to know more please call or text me or email and Ill let you know more about the pistol)

CK-AMF Ruger® LCP Side Mount Laser 
LaserLyte® answers the growing demand for lasers specific to the increasingly popular conceal carry market with the new Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser (CK-AMF). At half the cost of a leading competitor, the CK-AMF fits on the side of the Ruger LCP and the Kel-Tec .380 and .32. Easy to mount on the gun by simply pushing out and replacing the stock pins with the new screws (included).  Then push the ergonomic activation button with the index finger and the laser is on target. The CK-AMF design works also as a finger guide that allows for safe trigger control without blocking the laser beam. The programmable laser features a pulse or constant on mode and also has an auto-off function to prevent an unwanted battery drain. The side mounted laser allows the pistol to fit in virtually any nylon pocket holster. The new LaserLyte Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser is compact and light, and foremost – deadly

 * Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
 * The bolt of the VZ 2008 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
 * The VZ 2008 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
 * The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ 58.
 * The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ 2008.
 * The VZ 2008 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. 
* The alloy magazine of the VZ 2008 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lb. vs. .84 lb.)
 * VZ 2008 is easier to field strip.
 * The VZ 2008 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47.

(Stainless)
It's from the early 2000's. My father gave it to me, but I just bought a new revolver so something has to go…
He never shot it to much. It just sat on his night stand for home defense. He took it to the range every once in a while, but that was really early on in the guns life. It has some (noob) scratches underneath and around the slide stop. It was his first 1911 and he had trouble taking the gun apart. I showed him how to do it later. Gotta love dads! :) I've put some rounds in it recently, but not a lot. It has maybe 350 rounds through it total.
It comes with:
(3) 8 round Wilson Combat Elite Tactical Magazines, (6) 7 round Springfield magazines.
Ed Brown 1-Piece GI guide rod, with matching recoil spring plug. I'll include the original 2 piece full length guide rod as well.
Springfield Nylon Holster, and a Single Leather Mag Pouch. (Both of which were purchased about not quite 2 months ago but never used.) The Wilson magazines are also brand new and never been used.

The rifle appears at one time to have been wire wrapped, but it was taken off at some point. It has a small brass screw instead of the bolt and nut in the stock.
It functions great, the black finish is missing from some of the metal. Bore is strong and the wood is in good condition. The date on the right side of the butt socket is 1962.
I value this at between $275-$300. I have some stippers, some ammo and the sling as well.
