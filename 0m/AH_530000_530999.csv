Listed here is one of the sweetest pocket 9mm's available ( short of the Rohrbaugh 9mm).  This is the Kahr PM9.  NOTE:  THIS IS NOT THE CHEAPLY MADE KAHR CM9.  The PM9 is a better made alternative with Polygonal Rifling to increase accuracy.

For a GREAT video on this gun, check out Hickock45's independent review and you'll see what I mean.  This gun is slim, accurate and deadly in a 9mm chambering.

So, here is EVERYTHING that comes with the pistol.  Note that I am not interested in breaking up the package.  The price shown reflects a great loss I am taking on the gun and the accessories included. 

1.  Kahr PM9 - Two Tone Finish - 90-95% with approx. 200 Prev. round count.  Original Box/ Paperwork/ Lock & Key

2.  Night Sights ( STILL EXTREMELY BRIGHT)

3.  A-Grip Grip enhancer.  This is a great felt like material that helps to grip the pistol under all conditions.  Completely removable with no affect on the pistol

4.  3 Magazines - 2 Six round mags and 1 Seven Round Mag

5.  Package of 2 Pearce Grip Extensions - 1 installed already

6.  HOLSTERS - 1st holster is a IWB Holster made by HIGH NOON HOLSTERS.  2nd holster is a custom hand made Pocket Holster made by James Dean Gun Leather specifically for me in Saddle Tan with white stitching and Black Thumb push off

7.  About 12 round of Hornady Zombie Max 9mm ammo

The P229® is one of the most popular law enforcement pistols available today. Its nearly indestructible design outlasts, and out performs, other pistols so much so that after extensive testing with over 3,000,000 rounds fired, the Dept. of Homeland Security’s office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) selected the P229 over pistols from five other major manufacturers. Now the P229 is the standard duty pistol for not just DHS but also the U.S. Coast Guard, and is carried by other federal agencies that we aren’t permitted to discuss."

My number is 70four 668 377four. It sells for $125 and up new. First $100 gets it. I will list the info on the barrel from Lone Wolfs site below. Thanks, Alan.

The PT1911 has been a great handgun and has never had a single hiccup. It has digested everything i have fed it, from FMJ, cast lead, or JHP's. I will include at least 2 8 round magazines with it and the hybrid holster I made for it. Mechanically the only thing that has been changed has been the safety to a NON-AMBI safety for carry. I will include the original Ambidextrous safty as well as the original grips and screws. (upgraded to pachmayr grips)

Any questions or to request pics, shoot me an email. I'm taking the Taurus into my local FFL tomorrow to get a quote for sale, so no ridiculous or low-ball offers.

Thanks,

I say ""brand new"" because I was the original purchaser of this rifle around 3 or 4 years ago, but I have never used it.  It's never left my safe, except for mounting the scope rings and scope.  It's never been fired, except for pulling the trigger and checking the pull weight with snap-caps inserted.  The trigger pull is right at 3 lbs from the factory.  It has an internal / blind-box magazine.  The rifle was originally sold as a combo package, which I believe went by the combo name of 110FXP3.  Initially, it had a Bushnell scope on it, but I removed it and replaced it with the Nikon.

The scope is also ""brand new"" - bought around the same time but never used except for mounting it to this rifle.  It is a Nikon Buckmaster 3-9x40 scope with Nikoplex reticle and Nikon scope protector.

The manual, etc., for the rifle and box and manual for the scope are included, as seen in the picture.

I've never been one to sell a gun,
always figured once I acquired a gun, I was stuck with it for life
and the only way anyone will get it from me is in my will. 

But alas, my little gun safe is getting overly full
and I need to make some room for an upcoming purchase.

I have this Tristar Setter O/U 12 Gauge shotgun that I won at
an NWTF banquet earlier this year,
it has never been shot, beautiful gun with engraving on the receiver.
Although this looks like an expensive high dollar O/U weapon
it really is a very affordable gun, and would be perfect for
someone who shoots a lot of sporting clays or skeet.
I just don't do enough of that kind of shooting to give this gun
the home that it deserves, I would like to see it go to someone on
a trap team, maybe a high school trap team member.
Here is a link to Tristar's web page with details on this gun;

Sightmark® Pistol Laser Boresights provide the most convenient and accurate method for sighting in pistols specific to the bore sight’s caliber. Simply chamber the bore sight like a regular bullet and a laser dot will show exactly where the pistol is aiming; it’s easy to sight in your firearm or scope without firing a single shot. Live fire is only needed to fine tune the firearm being sighted to compensate for inconsistencies, such as bullet drop due to distance. Perfect for hunters, competitive shooters and law enforcement, the Sightmark™ Pistol Laser Bore Sight is sure to take the frustration out of sighting in almost any pistol. The bore sights are easy to use and will quickly save both time and money by avoiding prolonged live fire tests at the range; use the extra ammo for honing those shooting skills and for the hunt. A lightweight carrying pouch protects the laser for convenient use in the field. The Sightmark™ Pistol Laser Bore Sight is available in the most common calibers for use with the most popular pistols.

The 4th Generation Glock ""Safe Action"" brings revolutionary design changes to the world's most popular pistol. Externally, what is immediately apparent is the multiple backstrap design of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to small, standard and large frame hands. The surface of the frame is the Generation 4 Rough Textured Frame scientifically designed, real world tested. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed shooters. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment.

The original rubber grips have been swapped out for aftermarket wood stocks with gold Colt medallions (sorry, I did not receive the originals). Mechanically this Anaconda is in fine shape with good timing and lock-up. It's been fired, but not that much. The bore is excellent with bright, sharp rifling. It comes in the original Colt factory case with owner's manual, hang tag and miscellaneous factory paperwork. I believe this revolver was manufactured in about 1999."

DISCLAIMER. Due to the high feed ramp, it does not feed well with Round Nose ammo (Federal). Feeds well with more blunt shape ammo (Blazer, TulAmmo).

Other than that, its a great handgun, I don't carry it that often and have the needs to pay some bills.

 The Great thing about the mags and mods is that it makes a full grip which makes for a better shooting gun bringing it from a subcompact to a compact firearm. i also have the original mags so that if you need that subcompact concealable option its a quick change out for those of you with CCW's.
I am looking for a Black/Blued .45 1911. I am not looking for a high point or anything like that just to put that out there so that nobody's time is wasted.. I'm looking to see what people have to offer and i might be willing to throw in a little cash if the 1911 is nice enough.
The Kal-Tec is is perfect shape has only had about 40 rounds through it and i am the original owner so it comes with two Modified Magazines and one original magazine that is stock for the gun as well as the plates to make the others stock as well if you don't like the modified handle system, It also comes with the box the mods and all the paperwork that comes with the gun.
If your interested feel free to email me a photo of what ya got or you can text me at REDACTED
No shady people please, and will be happy to do a receipt for the trade

990,http://www.armslist.com/posts/530990,For Sale/Trade:  Remington 870 12GA TRAP Barrel  -  S-C-A-R-C-E,"mid-town Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee",$ 235,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 5, 2012",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a hard-to-find TRAP barrel for a Remington 870! 

This beautiful shotgun barrel is 30"" long with a 2 3/4"" chamber, Modified choke, 12GA. This barrel is 99% and looks as if it has never been on a gun! It is marked, ""MOD TRAP"" on the barrel. 

This is the first one we've seen! Even Brownell does not have them.  (They are SOLD OUT!) If you are a trap competitor and use an 870, you need this barrel. We don't expect to ever have another one of these to sell. This barrel is intended only for the SERIOUS sporting clays shooter.

We take trade-ins! Any brand, gage, size pump or auto barrel. We also take stocks and forearms in trade too.
