I do not need anything with this high of magnification. Anyways, I removed this scope and replaced it with a nikon pro-staff with a lower magnification. It is much better for the hunting application that I will be needing. I don't believe that it has ever seen any use, at least not from me. The scope is a SWFA 16x42. It has butler creek flip caps installed and sits on utg quick detach rings. This scope also has a sun shade installed. This is a wonderful piece of glass, just a little bit too much for what I will be using the rifle for. I never take shots past 100 yards. This scope is a mil-dot scope. I am asking $300 cash or $400 trade for the scope. I am negotiable on the cash price to an extent but not much.

7mm WSM beautiful gun in 95% condition
I bought new about 10 years ago and took 3 deer with it. Approx 25 to 30 bullets through it at most. 
Has a Konus 4x12x50 on it. Great optic, illuminated reticle, has the original battery it came with still in it still works just fine, also have another battery for the scope. 
Sells with scope, sunshade, screw on end caps, scope box, extra battery, hard plastic case, and sling. If local pick up I will throw in the ammo as well. 
Have 3 boxes about 35 to 45 bullets total, If you are a deer hunter, that will be all you need for about 10 years. I have some federal fusion, some Winchester fail safes, and some Winchester ballistic silver tips, all between 140 and 160 grains.    
Gun is super accurate and the scope is very nice. Holds zero like no other. I would shoot a 3 shot group to make sure it was on, then 1 at a deer and be done with it for a year. Deer do not go very far after being hit with this gun, plenty of power for anything you are looking to hunt.  
Always cased and cleaned after shooting, pictures do not do it justice took them with my crappy cell phone. My old lady won’t let me get a new pistol until I let one in my collection go. I am looking to get a new 1911 and an AR-10 so I am letting go one of my hunting rifles and one of my sniper rifles.

Gun is super accurate and the scope is very nice. Holds zero like no other. I would shoot a 5 shot group at a 100 then 5 at 200 then pretty much be done for the day.  
Always cased and cleaned after shooting, pictures do not do it justice took them with my crappy cell phone. My old lady won’t let me get a new pistol until I let one in my collection go.

TA01ECOS: Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Dark Earth Brown Scope, Center Illumination Amber Crosshair Reticle w/ 3.25 MOA RMR Sight FEATURES SPECS OPTIONS ACCESSORIES 

The Trijicon ACOG ECOS is the ultimate sight for both Close Quarter battle (CQB) situations and longer distance shooting where accuracy and pinpoint bullet placement are required. 
Trijicon is the first to market with its unique dark earth brown color, a definite factor to concealment- directly contributing to the safety of the operator, who is often in harm’s way. This dual-sighting system gives the shooter a distinct tactical advantage with the option of either the Trijicon ACOG or the RMR Sight. With the quick target acquisition of the RMR Sight or the precise aiming capabilities provided by the magnified 4 power Trijicon ACOG- the shooter has the ability to select the proper aiming solution for the situation at hand- truly the best of both worlds. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the ECOS also features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps.

We use actual case-law examples to show not just how the laws are written, but the spirit of the law, how they have been interpreted, and how jurors may view a case.

Sadly, the majority of law-abiding citizens who have been prosecuted for killing an assailant may not have been charged had they understood the laws. While acting in ""self-defense"" many CCH Permit holders have been convicted because their actions were based on incorrect information about the laws. Don't take chances.

I purchased the shotgun new with the intention of getting into duck/goose hunting, but that never happened. I shot two boxes of shells through it at clays to ensure it functioned properly and then cleaned it before putting it in my dry safe where it has been stored ever since.

A few of the early 887s were problematic, but this is not one of them. The gun runs flawlessly with 2 3/4"", 3"", & 3 1/2"" shells. It is 99% new, in the box with all paperwork & accessories. I even have a spare magazine tube plug.

Looks to be at 96+ - 98+%, only two faint and difficult to see tiny wear marks at front edge of slide. Comes with its original German/English handbook. No box or papers, etc.  See Picture. 

This Walther TPH serial # is 2890XX. Please don't mistake this gem specimen TPH for the US stainless steel clones. This TPH is from my personal collection and is the exceedingly scarce and collectible high quality 100% German made version in mint/gem condition. If your safety requires the finest small back-up pistol in existence or if you simply desire a tangible investment that is guaranteed to grow in value -- the German made TPH is for you. 

The German made version of the TPH is very rare and expensive because of the 1968 Gun Control Act ( GCA ) One provision of the GCA stipulated that all firearms imported into the US must ""be generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes."" As interpreted by BATF, the Walther TPH pistol did not meet the ""sporting purposes"" criteria provision and was thus permanently banned from US importation ( except under rare circumstances as outlined below ). 

Since Walther did not start manufacturing the TPH until early 1968, Interarms was only able to legally import a minimal number of German made TPHs prior to the GCA effective date of 10/22/68. Since then, only a few TPHs have been legally imported into the US ( on an ATF Form 6 ) by either returning US servicemen or German immigrants. 

Because of their scarcity, the current value of authentic German manufactured TPH pistols is many times the original MSRP and continues to appreciate. Walther designed the TPH to serve as a ""back-up"" weapon for law enforcement officers. However, due to their value, these days few TPHs are actually carried. The vast majority of German made TPHs reside safely in the vaults of knowledgeable investors. 

This TPH exhibits German craftsmanship through out. It has a highly polished deep blue finish, fixed contrast sights, checkered black synthetic grips and the original TPH owners manual.

PRICED AT $949.00 OBO and subject to withdrawal.

WILL SHIP TO YOUR FFL FOR $20.00.

Buyer's purchase of this item confirms buyers responsibility and agreement to conform with all Federal, state and local laws that apply to the purchase, shipping and possession of handguns where the buyer is located. Shipment by UPS upon receipt of full payment by either Postal Money Order(s) or official bank check in the amount of the purchase along with the required copy of your FFL.

Stock has a professionally repaired 3 1/4' hairline crack. Work done by our Master Gunsmith/Engraver, Larry Cole. His work had been featured in many magazine covers , articles and NRA Presentation Firearms. 

The Savage 99 was preceded by the Savage 1895, which was the first hammerless lever-action rifle produced. The hammerless design is a substantial improvement because the time from trigger pull to firing is less. This makes the rifle more accurate, because the rifleman's muscular tremors have less time to move the rifle off-aim. A hammerless design is also less likely to jam in brush or clothing. 

The magazine design allowed the rifle to be one of the first lever-action rifles to use spitzer bullets. Previous lever-action rifles used tubular magazines, which placed cartridges of ammunition end to end. With spitzer bullets, the pointed tips of the ammunition would contact the primer of the cartridge in front of it, possibly causing an accidental discharge. Another novel safety feature- upon cocking the rifle, a small pin would protrude above the top receiver to indicate the rifle was cocked and ready to fire.

Item description:
Compact, lightweight pistol that’s ideal for concealed carry
•Less than 1"" thick and 6"" in overall length
•Packed with M&P features for superior performance and reliability
•Two magazines included

Smith & Wesson’s M&P pistols are the handguns of choice for many law-enforcement units, and for good reason. Rugged reliability and accuracy combine with solid construction to make the M&P line stand out in a highly competitive field.  Now Smith & Wesson offers the lightest, slimmest and most compact semiautomatic in the M&P family – the Shield™. Less than 1"" thick, 6"" overall length and weighing just 19 oz., the Shield is perfect for concealed carry or a law-enforcement backup gun. Striker fired with a low bore axis and an 18° grip angle, the Shield delivers a natural sight picture and points instinctively. The consistent trigger pull and short trigger reset enhance accuracy and make for fast follow-up shots. Unlike some compact semiautomatics, the Shield is outfitted with a thumb safety for added peace of mind. Chambered in 9mm with a 3.1"" barrel, accuracy is outstanding for a compact semiautomatic. Maintenance is easy with the patented M&P No Tool Takedown System. A steel recoil-spring rod adds durability and the captured spring speeds the takedown and cleaning process. The Shield comes with two magazines, a seven-round version that fits flush with the base of the grip and an eight-round version with an extended finger rest.

This is a highly collectable Ruger Security Six 2 3/4"" barrel 357 Magnum in Stainless Steel. This gun is in 99% condition, I say 99% as it is used but not much!!! No rust, scratches, or any other issues. It is flawless.

When I say highly collectable, first off it was made in 1975, this was the first year Ruger made this gun in Stainless Steel, also this is a PRE-WARNING revolver. In 1977 Ruger started put warning stamps on the barrel stating to read owners manuel etc... before using the gun. My gun has no warning, lastly it is the snub nose version made with a 2 3/4"" barrel, these are alot harder to come by as the production numbers on these length barrels were very limited. It has adjustable sights as well. Try and find a 2 3/4"" Pre warning in this condition, you wont, I searched two years before I found this one and it was a fluke, they are just not out there for sale very often???

I have a nice pair of Hogue Grips on the gun and I also have the original wooden grips, the original grips are mint condition. This gun has been fired very little and lockup is super tight and the trigger in single action is crisp, so crisp and light it is amazing. One of the best pistols I have ever owned and fired. Selling it to fund another project!

Lastly this gun comes with a handmade leather holster, this holster was special made for this gun and the two combine for a excellent carry piece.
This gun also comes with two Dade speed loaders and some ammo.

I will accept reasonable offers on this gun package. Additional pictures available upon request. Wichita area only FTF"

This gun is in 99% condition, I say 99% as it is used but not much!!! No rust, scratches, or any other issues. It is flawless.

When I say highly collectable, first off it was made in 1975, this was the first year Ruger made this gun in Stainless Steel, also this is a PRE-WARNING revolver. In 1977 Ruger started put warning stamps on the barrel stating to read owners manuel etc... before using the gun. My gun has no warning, lastly it is the snub nose version made with a 2 3/4"" barrel, these are alot harder to come by as the production numbers on these length barrels were very limited. It has adjustable sights as well. Try and find a 2 3/4"" Pre warning in this condition, you wont, I searched two years before I found this one and it was a fluke, they are just not out there for sale very often???

I have a nice pair of Hogue Grips on the gun and I also have the original wooden grips, the original grips are mint condition. This gun has been fired very little and lockup is super tight and the trigger in single action is crisp, so crisp and light it is amazing. One of the best pistols I have ever owned and fired. Selling it to fund another project!

Lastly this gun comes with a handmade leather holster, this holster was special made for this gun and the two combine for a excellent carry piece.
This gun also comes with two Dade speed loaders and some ammo.

I will accept reasonable offers on this gun package. Additional pictures available upon request. Wichita area only FTF"

I bought this gun new quite a few years ago. I had a 229 at the time and didn't like the way the finish on it was holding up on it. I told the saleman at the gunshop that I wanted a 220 if he could get one in nickel with night sights. A couple weeks later he called.

I bought a set of Houge grips and put them on right away so the original grips have never been used and are included. I also bought 2 Mecgar magazines to go along with the 2 factory Sig magazines. All magazines hold 7 rounds each. I think they moved to 8rnds shortly after that.

You may not be able to make it out in the pictures but this 220 was made in Germany and is a .45.

The night sights are a little weak but they still light up.

This Sig shoots fantastic. If I would have to guess at the round count I'd have to say somewhere between 500-1,000 but I'm thinging it is closer to 500.

I really never intended to part with this but i found something else that I want and I need to come up with some funds for it.

I'm asking $850 but will consider a reasonable offer.

Would consider a trade for a quality factory built AR, an Arsenal AK in 7.62, Gen 4 Glock 26 or 19, or 9mm ammo, with added cash either way depending on the deal.

I'll need to see your IDL and LTC. 

I would be able to travel a reasonable distance to do a deal."

The gun was purchased as a backup gun, to be used if I had to send my carry gun off for repair or what-have-you. Upon purchasing the gun, I fired approximately 250 rounds through it as a function check and break in, then cleaned/oiled it and stored it in a humidity controlled environment. It has not been fired since. Although the gun cannot rightly be called NIB since it has gone through break-in/function check, it is as close to new as you can get without being NIB. 

The pistol has Trijicon night sights on it, a $115 value, plus installation. Original case and 2x 17-round magazines are included. All three backstraps (small, medium, and large) are included. Original manual, gun lock, cleaning kit, and any other accessories are not included. 

New, this gun would be valued at over $600. The 250 rounds I put through it are going to be the most expensive ammo I ever fired :-D

I would prefer to sell locally, but I am willing to ship within the state of Tennessee (buyer pays actual shipping cost)."
