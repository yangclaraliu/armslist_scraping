It is the same Browning Design as the Belgian built A-5 'Humpback"". 
 The gun is chambered in 2 3/4"" 16 ga., and has a Full Choke 28"" Ribbed Barrel. The wood, bore & mechanics are excellent, there is NO rust or pitting; but the bluing on the receiver is a bit thin. The barrel is excellent! It has a nice quality old/vintage lace-up leather 'boot' to protect the stock that has never been removed.
 The 16's are rather under appreciated in this country, but are an excellent Gauge for bird & small game hunting. I don't recall what happened the 'Plug' (the wooden dowel in the magazine), but last time I fired this gun I think it was in 7+1 mode, and dumped a 8 rounds very smoothly, accuarately, and scary damned fast!
 Bill Jordan -Designer of the Famed Smith & Wesson Model 19 K frame .357 magnum, used to carry a sawed off Remington Model 11 in 12 ga. to solve 'Border Disputes'. The semi-auto design made it possible to drive & shoot at the same time. Yep, Ol' Bill was somethin'....to not mess with.
 When I was younger, I borrowed the Browning version to hunt Jack Rabbits
at night from a Pickup bouncing through the wheat fields....we lost a lot of rabbits, but not one fender! 
This Browning design, like the 1911acp- is a tried & true CLASSic (with a Capital 'Class')...these things Shoot! But: You probably already know that.
 Poor little birds & bunnies.
I'd like to sell locally, so let me know if you'd like a great ol' 16."

### if you have a cash offer. Make it. But please take note of what these are going for stock used and then account for all these accessories, time, and professional Smithing. I dont have to sell.. dont really want to sell, i want to trade, but you can ask.

Also, dont have a beat up old gun and want to trade even
 If you have decent rifle dont expect to get this immaculate pistol with 500+ dollers worth of accessories. Multiple decent gun trades or one ""gun of a different color"" of roughly equal value. 

Reason off possible parting is i have several pistols and this was a project gun i completed. Now its nice to look at and is amazing to shoot, but i have an itch for other things. Im not trying to make any money on it or take advantage of anyone. Just a lot of work and money went into her and i am wiling to let her go, but not give her away."

314,http://www.armslist.com/posts/449314,For Sale:  Professional Cerakote Firearms Finishing,"All Kansas & USA, Kansas, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Monday, September 17, 2012",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"!!SALE ON 1911's!! SEP 13-OCT 13 - Business is good, and we want to offer 1911 owners a special deal to have your pistol coated with the world best firearm finish. This offer is good for SINGLE color applicatons, ie; slide 1 color, and frame one color. Camo patterns are not part of this sale.

There seems to be some confusion as to whether the polymer frame of the glock or other brands can be finished with the oven cure Cerakote. 
THE GLOCK POLYMER FRAME,  (and most other brands) CAN BE COATED WITH THE OVEN CURE CERAKOTE WITH NO PROBLEMS WHAT SO EVER. 
The only way to possibly damage the frame, is if the coating is applied by an untrained, unqualified, unlicensed person, who does not have an extensive understanding of coatings and the proper temperatures to use for the surface the coating is being applied to, nor any extensive knowledge of multiple different firearms dis-assembly and re-assembly. 

Only trust your firearms to be worked on by established, experienced, licensed, and insured gunsmiths. We have recently had several firearms brought in for repair or recoating, that were done by ""garage"" ""shade tree""   type persons who felt that because they ""tinkered"" with their own personal guns, it qualified them to perform work on someone elses firearm. Dont let yourself be put in that situation because a guy offers you ""the deal of the century"". It can be very costly. 

One unfortunate example of this is, an AR-15 rifle that was brought in by a customer a few weeks ago, who used a ""wannabe gunsmith"" to coat his rifle. He took the rifle out to shoot, and the round ruptured the chamber in his face due to too heavy a coating being allowed to be applied in places it was not supposed to be, and improper re-assembly procedures. Luckily, the shooter was wearing high grade, USGI eye protection, and walked away with only some minor scars.  

We try very hard to offer our services at very reasonable prices, and still be able to offer them. We welcome you to search around the internet for the coating prices and turnaround times of multiple shops around the US. You will find that we have excellent pricing and turnaroud times, with the utmost professional quality finished products.

We offer discounts for Law Enforcement, Fire, EMS, and Military with current ID.

It has the RRA, CAR tactical stock but this one is pinned into position so it is legal for sale in New Jersey or other places that restrict collapsible stocks also the barrel is the heavy barrel without a flash suppressor on for the same reason.. It also has the RRA railed gas block with removable A2 style front sight and the RRA Star safety selector. Overall condition of this gun is about 98%, it does have one scratchon the right side of the rifle on the magazine well if this makes a difference to you. Like we said it is used but it has not been fired much if you look at the ejection port brass deflector it barely has any brass marks from being fired. You will be happy with this rifle as you cannot get much better quality that RRA.

This gun is used but has been well taken care of and we were told has only had about 50-60 shells fired through it, and it looks like it is new. Overall condition is excellent and the finish is 99-100% good as seen in the photos. It comes with the hard case, 5 choke tubes (the other choke tube is in the barrel and is a “modified” choke), choke tube wrench and has an after-market Birchwood-Casey shell catcher (which is only held on by pressure tape and can be removed should you desire to do so). The shotgun has a 28” vent rib barrel and has the spacers to adjust the length of pull on the stock. The stock and forearm is black plastic and the stock has the softer cheek weld insert and a padded butt plate that is all original Benelli.

Need to pay bills instead. Price is $200 FIRM. I have more than that in the rifle, and if I do not get $200 to pay my current bills, I will just keep it and fix it up later. This is a wartime M39, Sako, barrel date 1944, unsure of the tang date as I have not disassembled it fully yet. Bore does have some wear, lands look okay, some pitting on the grooves. Blue is about 30% maybe. It needs; bolt handle, extractor, ejector/interuptor, magazine floor plate, both front and rear action screws, rear site slide, front sight blade and screws. If you have an old beat up M91/30 that would do as some parts would just swap over. I have not fired the rifle since buying, so have a competent gunsmith look at any used firearm before shooting. I am in Westminster, Carroll County, Maryland. Need to see a MD drivers license to make sure you are a MD resident. I work 8-5 M-F then rush home to get kids from daycare, and some Saturdays, so I cannot travel too far. Any questions, just ask. The parts for these M39s are all over Gunbroker or Ebay. The sights have been around $15 each, the screws $10. Extractors about 9.99, and bolt handles vary, but it may be easier to just swap anothr Mosin bolt. This one has a bent bolt, but the bent handle is loose, so could just use a weld. This has a Sako wartime stock with rounded joint fingers. Thanks for looking!"

Please don't tell me there is no difference between the two chamberings, but a Wylde chamber would be just fine as well.  I'd prefer it be in the standard M16-A2 version, with carrying handle, adj. rear sights, front sight w/bayonet lug, solid butt stock, long hand grips/forestock.  As a retired Marine, I'd like to continue shooting what feels right, and the old tried and true A2 style feels right.  A flat top with a detachable carry handle would work, so long as I still have my front and rear iron sights with a bayonet lug.  Will consider all brands and versions, but I have my preferences as stated, and lean towards Stag/Colt/Spikes/Armalite/LMT, on recommendations from across the internet.  I'm not looking to target shoot with this rifle, I want a rifle that will do what you expect it to, under all conditions, just as an AR/M16 should.

This Taurus PT-1911 is no plain jane 1911. It's got many feautures a high end 1911 might come with but it came this way from the factory. If you know anything about 1911's, you know it's a worthwhile 1911. Great home defense caliber chambered in .45 ACP

The laser has recently shown minor problems of spidering or webbing. Its in need of a cleaning to get the laser the produce a perfect dot. It has just recently started doing this. I contacted Crimson Trace, and am waiting for a response from them.

2010 NRA Handgun of the year as this is one of the lowest recoil and thinnest grips on a double stack 9mm striker fire. Comes with case, 12rd and 17rd clips, lock, magazine loader, and a new in the bag Fobus 360 belt  holster. Never carried. Asking $512 obo (or best offer) REDACTED text or call. 

The MSRP on these is $512 but this is technically used so feel free to make an offer. Trades are welcome if you have something of value.

These are ideal for people who don't like the bulk of a glock, but love the functionality and want a thinner grip. These are also very thin for a double stack so if you're carrying inside the waistband you get the feel and fit of a slim or single stack without sacrificing your round count. You also get the versatility of a small grip no ""printing"" when you conceal carry, but when open carrying during hiking/camping, or just for home protection, you can still pop in the 17 rnd magazine which is included.

The Rifle was $950, the ProMag kit was $180, The 20 round magazines were $80 dollars each and the rings were something like $35. The rifle was a project that i was going to use for hog hunting but i have no time so im letting it go. I put two boxes (40 rounds) through this rifle in total! Ive sunk well over $1200 in this rifle and everything on it is new or like new. The rings were never mounted  and 2 of the 20 round mags and the 5 round mag have never even been loaded. This is a very nice rifle for the same amount you'd pay for the rifle alone! I have it priced to sell fast so contact me on my phone for fastest response! Thanks and good luck!

It can also be registered as an SBR if you would like to put a bit stock on it.  It is also an idea set-up for a suppressor (will give the appearance of an integrally supressed rifle) So, here are all the parts:

Tactical innovations upper and lower receivers
RRA chromed bolt carrier group
RRA lower parts kit with JP Enterprises enhanced reliability spring kit (brings trigger weight down to about 4.5-5 pounds),

RRA pistol buffer tube, buffer, and buffer spring

RRA charging handle w/ Black Rain tac-latch

I literally have exactly $1300 in this build, I build these as a hobby so I could really care less about making money, I just want to start new projects.

If you would like the Viridian laser it is an extra $200, if not I will just continue the rail covers out to the end.

Also, I am able to accept credit cards, I have one of those Square card readers, 100% secure, but they do charge me 2.75%, so we you would need to cover that.  But it is an option if you're interested."

This is an early model, low serial number (ending in 30) S&W M&P 15-22 with MANY accessories and upgrades. I am not interested in selling this rifle, just trading as I have another interest. The only things I’m interested in trading this rifle for is an AR- style 9MM or 45 ACP pistol that I can turn into an SBR (so no Kel Tec or Sig’s please),  a 16” 9MM rifle or an AR style  5.56, .223, 5.45 or other  caliber AR style pistol, carbine or rifle. Please don’t contact me and offer me cash or non firearm related items as I am only interested in trading for another AR. 

The rifle is in very good overall shape with minor wear. The rounds count is about 1200-1500 rounds and it fires FLAWLESSLY. All the springs were upgraded early in its life by S&W as some of this line of  rifles had issues with misfires when they first appeared on the scene. This rifle loves all types of .22 ammo so it will eat whatever you feed it. :) It’s a real tack driver as I can put five rounds in a target the size of a nickel at 100 yards with this scope. The scope is a range finder scope with a dual red and green display with multiple brightness settings. If you don’t know what a range finding scope looks like, imagine a mil-dot scope with a small football field on the bottom of the glass. This small football field is similar to a golf scope and helps you estimate how far the target is when at an unknown distance. I will include all instructions for the scope, rifle and accessories. 

It turns heads at the range and I am always asked to see it and what I’ve done to it. I’ve had it on here for a few weeks, and have had a number of offers, but most of them have been from people too far away not willing to travel. I am willing to travel for the right deal, but would love for someone to meet me half way. If you’re having a hard time selling your AR, this might be a good trade as you could flip this one easily since these rifles are in high demand. You could also part this out as the accessories on here are worth over $500 in total.

This rifle includes the following:
 •S&W M&P 15-22 rifle 
 oUpgraded trigger and bolt springs
 oSix position collapsible stock
 oOriginal box
 oOriginal instructions
 •Eight original S&W 25 round magazines 
 •2 OD Green Magpul rubber magazine pulls
 •Original black pistol grip and butt stock
 •Tacti-Cool muzzle adopter 
 •DSG Arms AR-15 A2 muzzle compensator
 •Quad rail fore end
 •OD Green Gun Tec 6”-9” collapsible/extendable bipod with rubber feet 
 •10 OD Green Magpul XTM rail covers 
 •OD Green Gen 1 Magpul Advanced Fore Grip (AFG) 
 •OD Green Magpul MOE pistol grip 
 •OD Green Magpul Gen 1 front backup site 
 •OD Green Magpul Gen 1 rear backup site

 •NDZ Zombie Hunter magazine release lever 
 •NDZ oversized Zombie Hunter magazine release button

 •OD Green Tasco 2x6x32 range estimating scope 
 oRed/Green illuminated reticle
 oOriginal OD Green scope rings
 o1” black scope rings
 o½” quick release Weaver rail riser 

One thing to consider is that many of these parts can be installed on most AR platforms, (the stock is commercial width). I am willing to drive to Youngstown, Warren, Akron, Cleveland, Mansfield or even Columbus for the right deal, but the further away from the Youngstown area, the better the deal should be for me :).  When you contact me, include pictures, condition and other information about your trade. Please email me if interested and thanks for looking. If we can strike a deal, I will send you my number so we can begin the negotiations

It offers Superior innovation in the palm of your hand. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers all the performance of a.45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand. 

At only 1"" wide, the XD-Sfits as perfectly into your concealed-carry strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. And with it, you get the power of a .45 with superior control and comfort without sacrificing important safety features. The unique combination of an ultra-slim profile paired with enhanced performance point-and-shoot features allows you to shoot accurately without having to adjust your wrist giving you greater control. 

Prepare to be impressed with the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on your target. 

This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator and grip safety. In addition, the XD-S offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
