Features: ** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. ** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. ** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish. ** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. ** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. ** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. ** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. ** Hogue® Tamer grip helps reduce perceived recoil.

In 2001, DPMS expanded from its share of the .223/5.56mm market, and exploded onto the .308 rifle scene. The LR-308, the first and foremost of the .308 line, and for which the rifle series is named, is a rifle to be reckoned with. So much so that it was named the NRA Rifle of the year in 2005.
With a 24” stainless bull barrel, 1 in 10 twist and free floating handguard and a flat top receiver for easier mounting of optics, the LR-308 has gone toe to toe with bolt action rifles and delivered comparable accuracy, with higher magazine capacity and rate of fire. The conventional thought that ""only a bolt action could be considered a precision rifle"" has been in contention ever since.
This rifle features several factory installed modifications including replacing the slick side high rise upper receiver with an A3 upper receiver with forward assist, shell deflector and dust cover. Installing a JP adjustable trigger in place of the standard trigger and swapping a vented free float tube for the standard free float tube.

I purchased the rifle from The Dixie Gun Show earlier this year, immediately bought all necessary cleaning supplies, & have babied it since. The rifling shines like a flawless mirror when cleaned. I purchased the rifle for $525 & immediately got offers from people around the gun show wanting to buy it. It goes for around $800 brand new. Ruger makes excellent weapons, & the bolt design used on this gun is the same one the Russians used in the 1880's. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""

The barrel has been cut down to carbine length and the rear sight leaf has been removed to install a rail to accommodate a scope or red dot sight. The bolt has a handle that's been forged down and shaved. I cleaned up the trigger so it has no creep and breaks consistently. It's not a super light trigger though because those scare me a bit. The stock forend has been cut down to accommodate the shorter length. I feel that with the trigger work and the rail it is worth $150. The trigger is crisp and the bolt works nicely. Night and day compared to an out of the crate Mosin. I put a lot of work into this gun last year to get it shooting consistently. I just upgraded to a 700 in 308win, so it's time for someone else to enjoy it. Plus I've got another Mosin action waiting to get re-barreled to 243win this winter.

Like new Diamondback .380 auto. It looks like a mini Glock. Check out the pictures. We got it in a trade and I think it has everything a new one comes with. Plus an extra Mag. We have test fired two rounds in each magazine to confirm the weapon functions as it should with each mag. We cleaned it and put it back in the safe. The internals look like a very low round count weapon. I already have a CCW in .380, so this great CC weapon is up for sale or trade.

I have over $900 in rifle and $250 in trigger work and accessories. Trigger work was done by Bill Springfeild. It has about a 4-5LB trigger pull(if that)and smooth.

Scope does not come with rifle but I will give you the rail that only fits this rifle. It works very well.

Looking for unique firearms that I couldn't go out and find locally.

Internals/metal are in good shape. Bolt functions like it should, and there has been no cutting or bubba type shenanigans anywhere. This gun is stock.
The wood has some dings in it, but they're minor and could be cleaned up if someone was so inclined. I didn't want to alter this rifle in any way, so I haven't tried.

These were made in the 50's and 60's by Egypt using machines that originally made the Swedish AG-42, which is similar in action but a different caliber.
These rifles were some of the first direct impingement battle rifles. Only 70,000 or so were ever made, and of that only a couple thousand were imported into the US. They have an adjustable gas system, excellent muzzle break, and are fed by 10 round detachable box magazines.

The bore is PRISTINE and it shoots straight as an arrow. Took it out recently and put about 60 rounds of Yugo FMJ through it and it ran flawlessly.
Have a couple boxes of ammo still on clips to go with it.

Any other questions, just ask."

Light as a feather. The 625 Series is one of the best selling Citori over and under shotgun lines ever. With this high level of success some gun companies would just sit back and keep selling the same basic product. Not Browning. The Feather 625 field guns couple the 625 Field with our popular Feather Technology to make an over under shotgun already regarded as the best looking and finest handling -- even lighter and faster than ever before. Feather Technology replaces the steel receiver with an ultra lightweight alloy model that provides more than a full pound of weight reduction. Of course, lighter weight doesn't mean light duty.  Even with the alloy receiver, the strength and longevity of your Citori 625 Feather are not compromised. The Feather shotguns rely on a solid steel dovetailed breech face and steel hinge pin, both areas of high wear on an over and under, to take the brunt of the forces that act on these critical components.
With their reduced mass, 12 gauge 625 Feather models weigh about the same as a 20 gauge Citori, but with the advantages of faster handling and pointing, and a larger shot payload. This weight reduction also means a Citori 625 Feather is much easier to carry during a long day in the field. Shoulder a Citori 625 Feather and understand for yourself how a little less can actually be so much more.
If your looking for a lightweight, upland hunting over and under shotgun to carry all day long in the field hunting for doves, grouse, quail, chukar or pheasants (what have we missed? Perhaps Hungarian partridge and snipe) look no further than the Citori 625 Feather.

I will even toss in 2 boxes of hornady tap 230gr plus p rounds and a blackhawk surpa holster. This gun was a police officer trade in, it was a gun that sat in a police station and was never issued since they switched to the sig. The only rounds that have ever been put through it were some target rounds I put through it about a week ago, I only shot 50 so if you know anything about a glock you know its not even close to broke in yet. I got the gun to give glock a second chance but I just dont like the grip angle on them. I am asking 600 or best offer, Yes I know what its worth, I know I could get more but I know what gun I want to buy and how much I need to buy it. I will not go any lower than 500 for just the gun, mags and box, if you want the holster and ammo to its gonna be no less than 550 firm so dont bother with any offers lower than that. look up how much hornady tap 230gr .45 cal +p ammo is per box and how much the blackhawk serpa holster is as well as the gun it self with 2 mags and night sights, your getting a hell of a deal here. also I can even toss in a laser for the tactical rail that comes with a pressure switch or you can have it as a regular push button if you pay the 550, hell ill even toss in a blackhawk double mag pouch with adjustable retention for the 550.  so dont even try to low ball me on this. if you want to pay 580 ill give you another holster, it is a leather basket weave duty style holster that rides a little lower on your hip, its made by duty man holsters model 6721 for the glock 21. it fits the glock like a glove and has a thumb break strap. just try to get all that for 580 bucks anywhere else. the gun is registered to me so you WILL be signing a bill of sale and I WILL be getting a copy of your ID. If your a felon or some little wannabe thug dont bother I wont sell it to you. If you want to know anything else email this ad or call or text me at REDACTED."

If you have a project that you will ""get to one day"" and haven't - I want to buy it. I'll use the parts to make another Winchester almost new again! In the medical field you could say that I do ""transplants"" to patients needing a new heart, lung or such. Your old Winchester will live again but in another body. Go now, to the fartherest corner of your shop and dig out that old, tired soldier and send it to me. I'll prepare it for surgery.
You'll be surprised how much I'll pay for it!!

For Galco's 30th Anniversary we are reintroducing the concept of ""The Original Jackass Rig"". Galco's predecessor, ""The Famous Jackass Leather Company"", first introduced this shoulder system in 1969. The name Jackass derived from the horsehide we used to make most of our holsters and from the fact that we were stubborn for quality. With these first custom made Jackass Rigs, we began to service the officers of the Chicago Police Department. It was Jackass Leather that popularized horizontal/diagonal carry and originated the silhouetted, cut-off end of the shoulder holster, so it would not print under clothing. In 1980 Richard Gallagher, who started Jackass Leather, changed the name to Galco International, to facilitate expansion in the international market. The modernized version of the original rig features a horizontal holster with our patented swivel connectors, which can be adjusted to a more diagonal carry position. An ammo carrier that has a streamlined design and a genuine suede leather harness, giving unparalleled concealment opportunities. The suede harness has our trademarked clover shaped flexalon back plate that allows all four points of the harness to swivel independently for greater adjustment and comfort

964,http://www.armslist.com/posts/201964,For Sale:  Custom 3 Keg Kegerator,"Pleasant View, Missoula, Montana",$ 400,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 28, 2011",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I know this isn't really arms related for the most part, but I like guns, and I like beer, so maybe there is someone out there like me, who might need this! This is a custom made 3 keg capacity kegerator. It has the ability to run a 16 gal main keg, and two pony kegs. Currently it is setup/plumbed for 2 kegs, one 16 gal, and one pony keg. You would have the ability to modify it to run 3 kegs easily, as I originally intended to to do just that, but I ended up with only two at this point. The kegerator is made out of a full size fridge, which has lots of storage room on the upper shelf for glasses and cans/bottle of your non-kegged beer. There is also shelf space in the door for glasses/cans. The fridge does have a small freezer in the bottom, I would say about 1 cubic foot or so. I chose this fridge specifically for the small lower freezer, so there would be ample space for multiple kegs, but you could still freese glasses if you wanted to. The fridge gets cold fast and stays that way. This setup comes with a 20 pound co2 tank that has a dual gauge regulator (tank pressure/output pressure) as well as internal valving in the fridge, so you can shut off each keg individually, and the tank currently has about 850 pounds of pressure in it. You will probably be able to runs kegs off that amount of co2 for years! There is a custom made stainless steel drip tray attached to the front with internal resovior, so you don't have to set a bucket under the taps for someone to kick over all the time. Resovior is mounted inside the fridge door. All the fittings, taps, pour spouts, co2 and beer lines were all ordered from professional beer outlets. I will also throw in a 16 gal empty keg to use as your first deposit, saving you at least $50 on your first keg purchase! I also have some spare parts that will go with the setup also. All speed stickers come free of charge! I am selling this kegerator only because it has been a while since I have used it, and it is taking up space in my garage. I am confident you will get lots of use out of it. I have it cold now, and if you get it to your place and setup quickly, you could be drinking ice cold kegged beer within minutes!

I am looking for $400 for this kegerator setup. That being said I would be interested in possible partial trade for certain firearms or reloading equipment.. I am looking for a Ruger 10/22, Glock 23, bolt action .22lr rifle, , bolt action .223, and few others. Email or call me for more info, or to let me know what you might be willing to trade.
