Just FYI, I like 40 cal for home defense...thanks for checking out this ad, and Happy New Year!"

This is a high quality, factory buiilt AK with the 1.6mm receiver, not a WASR, CAI parts kit, or other lower quality AK. Do your research and you'll also find that this model has proven to be more dependable and durable than its counterpart, the AR. The 7.62x39 round also packs more punch than the 5.56 or .223 round.

Includes full upper, add any AR compete lower and it's ready to go! One 5.45 AR 30 round magazine is also included. Ammo is surplus and shoots great! Also have 36 BLACK TIP AP rounds made by Clark Custom and 7 HP rounds by Clark Custom Upper has had under 200 rounds through it. Also included heavy lower receiver spring never used. Haven't needed it but they provided it to me.

5.45 is the same round as the AK-74 and is nick named the poison bullet.  She thumps like a 5.56 AR when you shoot is.  Lots of fun to shoot!  If you have a spare lower or only have one, pop off your existing upper pin this in for good fun!

For those not familiar with Adams piston driven systems. Whole upper is coated so corrosive ammo does not hurt it. If you EVER have issues that guarantee it and will exchange or repair any issues for life. Gas pistons shoot MUCH cleaner than typical AR's especially with surplus ammo. It's a very high quality upper.

I live in IL and prefer to do FTF. But, This ammo is heavy! If you have a good and inexpensive way to ship everything, we can work it out. Buyer pays actual shipping cost.

FTF requires FOID due to ammo.  No wait (cool down) period required.  NO LOW BALL OFFERS.  I have a lot invested in this due to the quality of upper and ammo isn't as cheap as it use to be.

When your Kalashnikov is thirsting for a magazine that can handle a beating, no questions asked, the INTRAFUSE® 30rd AK Magazine is the only logical choice. Not to mention that this magazine counts as 3 U.S. 922r compliant parts.

These pieces of legislature would not only ban AR-15 style rifles, but ban ALL guns that are CAPABLE of receiving over 10 round magazines, which include most hunting rifles, handguns, and even quite a few shotguns. Also magazines over 10 rounds will be outlawed for all guns, certain features such as extendable stocks, pistol grips, and flash suppressors will also be banned. Even further, all current guns will have to be YEARLY registered IN PERSON by the ATF.
 This is not only a direct encroachment on American rights, but an endangerment to our future and our country. I do not know if any who read this will listen, but I would. Even if you do not have an “assault” style rifle, your hunting rifle is in danger as well. Enough is enough of being silent; it is time to stand up as an American, a god dang Patriot, like Thomas Jefferson, George Washington or Samuel Adams. Not just watch this all happen while sitting on your pile of ammo. Stand the hell up. Make the frickin call.
 Following is Congressman Jim Bridenstine’s number and others. Bridenstine is newly incoming and ""seems"" to be supportive while our SENATORS: Coburn and Inhofe are more suspect. ALL you have to do is say; I am a member of your district and would appreciate it you vote down ALL 2nd Amendment infringing legislature. That is ALL it takes, WE ARE A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. People seem to forget this. Without OUR input OUR leaders cannot represent us. In case you have not noticed, the “Pro-Gun” Republicans have been pretty weak kneed lately, maybe it’s time we remind them we are still here.

Here is the deal with the rifle. It is uncompleted. I started building this a year ago and lost interest. I just dont care for the AR platform. Anyways, the front sight needs pinned on and the gas tube installed. I didnt because I couldnt decide if I wanted a A2 sight or a gas block. I do have the pins and gas tube and it will go with the rifle. Also, no BCG. I lost interest before I bought one. Other than that its a complete rifle."

I'm not particularly looking to get rid of anything, just seeing what is out there. Let me know what you want and what you're interested in trading. Just looking to mix up my collection some. Mostly interested in other firearms, but let me know what you have. The worst I will say is no. Also, I'm not really looking to sell anything outright.

I've got a Ruger New Model Super Blackhawk with the 7.5"" barrel. I'm the second owner and have put 50 rounds down the pipe. No box, docs or locks. The gun is wearing hogue grips which make gripping and shooting a breeze. There are a couple blemishes that I've tried to show in the pictures but nothing more than minor cosmetic character marks. Accompanying this revolver is a black leather holster and a complete box of 50 winchester 240 grain jacketed soft point ammo. This is what I've shot in all my .44's and saw first hand at what the will do to a 120 pound deer at 40 yards (not out of this revolver though it will easily do it) - devastating.

These pieces of legislature would not only ban AR-15 style rifles, but ban ALL guns that are CAPABLE of receiving over 10 round magazines, which include most hunting rifles, handguns, and even quite a few shotguns. Also magazines over 10 rounds will be outlawed for all guns, certain features such as extendable stocks, pistol grips, and flash suppressors will also be banned. Even further, all current guns will have to be YEARLY registered IN PERSON by the ATF.
 This is not only a direct encroachment on American rights, but an endangerment to our future and our country. I do not know if any who read this will listen, but I would. Even if you do not have an “assault” style rifle, your hunting rifle is in danger as well. Enough is enough of being silent; it is time to stand up as an American, a god dang Patriot, like Thomas Jefferson, George Washington or Samuel Adams. Not just watch this all happen while sitting on your pile of ammo. Stand the hell up. Make the frickin call.
 Following is Congressman Jim Bridenstine’s number and others. Bridenstine is newly incoming and ""seems"" to be supportive while our SENATORS: Coburn and Inhofe are more suspect. ALL you have to do is say; I am a member of your district and would appreciate it you vote down ALL 2nd Amendment infringing legislature. That is ALL it takes, WE ARE A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. People seem to forget this. Without OUR input OUR leaders cannot represent us. In case you have not noticed, the “Pro-Gun” Republicans have been pretty weak kneed lately, maybe it’s time we remind them we are still here.

They are black in color (not FDE or OD Green like everyone is trying to get rid of) and hold 30 rounds. Each is individually packaged (as pictured).

Asking $36 a piece or $99 for all 3. Thanks!

The Troy Industries Battlemag is an advanced polymer 30-round magazine for AR-15 style firearms in .223 Remington. The polymers used in the magazine are chemical, biological and impact resistant. The feed lips have been reinforced and the mag uses an anti-tilt follower. The mag body features a aggressive scale texture that provides a sure grip but will also extract from magazine pouches easily. The spine of the magazine is designed to prevent over-insertion common with some polymer mags. The floor plate features a shock absorbing pull tab, or can be used with the flush locking plate. Functions with all M4, M16, AR-15, HK416, and FN SCAR rifles."

Born of a government request for a 9mm compact pistol suppressor that could be easily concealed and drawn from a daypack or case, the TUNDRA-SV was to provide the shortest size and greatest sound reduction without resorting to messy, telltale ""wet"" suppressor technology. At only 6.5"" long including the LID pistol recoil device, the TUNDRA-SV is still quieter than some of our older pistol suppressors For the civilian consumer, we made this to utilize our MULTIMOUNT family of rear adapters, making this little silencer extremely flexible, easily adaptable to pistols, 9mm carbines, .300WSP/BLK subsonic, UZI, MP5, and more. TUNDRA-SV suppressors are completely take-apart, allowing for easy cleaning if subcaliber .22lr is desired. Aerograde 7075 baffles for light weight, and the body is finished in optically Flat Black Type III, Class II MIL-8625 spec-hard anodizing."

NYS Compliant (fixed stock, no flash suppressor, no bayonet lug)
10 Round Magazine
Rifle has a continuous upper rail and has the ability to add additional rails at 3, 6 and 9 o'clock.
As with all Ruger's, this rifle is built like a tank.

This is a piston driven rifle and as such does not run as dirty as the normal direct impingement system.  The gases are expelled externally (like an AK) rather than back into your reciever where they ""gunk"" up the bolt carrier.  The piston system also allows you to open up the gas port and allow more gas in if you have weak ammo.  This rifle was done right by Ruger.  Check out the reviews online.

Rifle had 10 rounds fired through it to function test it after purchase.  It functioned flawlessly and has been a ""safe queen"" ever since.  Rifle was bought in August 2012 and is in like new condition.

I am using the proceeds towards the purchase of a tractor and as such I am not able to take trades toward the rifle (sorry, but cash only).

These pieces of legislature would not only ban AR-15 style rifles, but ban ALL guns that are CAPABLE of receiving over 10 round magazines, which include most hunting rifles, handguns, and even quite a few shotguns. Also magazines over 10 rounds will be outlawed for all guns, certain features such as extendable stocks, pistol grips, and flash suppressors will also be banned. Even further, all current guns will have to be YEARLY registered IN PERSON by the ATF.
 This is not only a direct encroachment on American rights, but an endangerment to our future and our country. I do not know if any who read this will listen, but I would. Even if you do not have an “assault” style rifle, your hunting rifle is in danger as well. Enough is enough of being silent; it is time to stand up as an American, a god dang Patriot, like Thomas Jefferson, George Washington or Samuel Adams. Not just watch this all happen while sitting on your pile of ammo. Stand the hell up. Make the frickin call.
 Following is Congressman Jim Bridenstine’s number and others. Bridenstine is newly incoming and ""seems"" to be supportive while our SENATORS: Coburn and Inhofe are more suspect. ALL you have to do is say; I am a member of your district and would appreciate it you vote down ALL 2nd Amendment infringing legislature. That is ALL it takes, WE ARE A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. People seem to forget this. Without OUR input OUR leaders cannot represent us. In case you have not noticed, the “Pro-Gun” Republicans have been pretty weak kneed lately, maybe it’s time we remind them we are still here.

I ask because over the past several weeks I have kept my mouth shut in regards to the absolutely mind blowing amount of garbage or overpriced crap that people post on here. WTF?

First things first, please learn how to type. This does not go for everyone so if you can utilize proper grammar then disregard. For those of you that cannot, do a quick spell check and go from there. It's freaking simple to do and takes two seconds.

Next lets go over what deserves to be described with the word ""custom"". If you put a few things that you picked up at your local gun store on your rifle or pistol and it did not require a professional in any way, or you are not a professional gunsmith yourself, then you do not have an item that should be called custom. A fucking glock with an high cap magazine or a piece of shit NC Star laser does not qualify your gun as something that is, or probably ever will be, custom. Just because it's custom to you does not mean it's custom to the rest of the gun community. ""One of a kind"", ""decked out"", ""tricked out"" and countless other descriptive terms should be stricken as well. Unless you know for a fact that your gun is in fact one of a kind, don't say that shit. Do some research before you go all out over-exaggerating what you've got.  God only knows how many ""one of a kind"" straight from the factory rifles there are out there but I'm willing to bet that there are way more than your taking credit for.

Sniper scopes. Jesus Christ, there is no such thing as a sniper scope. Only when a scope is mounted to a weapon that is in the hands of an actual trained sniper could your scope be considered a sniper scope. We get it, your really great at sniping digital terrorists in call of duty or you hit a target that was really far away that one time, but if your not a sniper then you don't have a sniper scope. Just say what you've got and let that be that. Not need to try to make what you have sound cooler than what it is. Most of the people reading your ad have a google search page opened up to see what it is anyway so chances are they will figure it out. If your not a sniper do not use sniper as a description for your gun or optics.

To go along with ""sniper rifles"" and ""sniper scopes"", the word ""tactical"" is getting a little fucking ridiculous. Just because you saw it in a movie being used by a military bad ass, your weapon is just a weapon. How it is employed makes it tactical. The other day I read an ad for a ""tactical"" airsoft gun and wanted to punch through my living room windows for that genius display of dumb ass adjective word association. If your not using your gun to clear rooms, breach doorways or any other activity that would need a tactical approach, then drop the word tactical from the description. 

Over pricing. Seriously, I understand wanting to make money, but come the fuck on. I saw a guy post a Sig rifle that retails brand new almost 1000 less than what he initially posted it for. This website is intended to help people network to find guns they want, not to pad your wallet. Just because there's some idiot out there that will pay too much for something doesn't mean they should. It's borderline unethical to take advantage of the people out there that either don't know any better or don't care about spending more money than they should. 

While the world is riddled with all sorts of problems, this site usually offers far more solutions than problems. If I offended you, well, I don't apologize because you probably fit into one of the previously mentioned categories and you need to learn how to post an ad on this site. That or you need to stop over compensating for what you have. To anyone that I've enlightened or anyone that expresses the same feelings as I do then I hope this benefits each and everyone of you. Even the people that want to talk up their ""one of a kind, tricked out, tactical custom AR15 sniper rifle"" because every sniper in the world knows that something that shoots .223 is a real game changer in the sniper community. 

I'm probably going to get flagged or receive some hate mail but I don't really give a shit. If this little rant prevents even one over embellished ad from being posted ad from going up then it was worth the five minutes it took to write this."

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
