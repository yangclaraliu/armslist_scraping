This is truly an amazing firearm. It shoots the peppy 5.7x28 round, the same as the PS90 and the FN 5.7. It has a quad rail installed, adjustable stock, muzzle break, and an Eotech 512 that takes double A batteries. This gun is extremely accurate and has never had any issues or malfunctions. Also mounted is a vector optics green laser that has amazing clarity. The laser is sighted in at 50 yards and is surprisingly accurate. This is an awesome AR. It will come with three magazines if my asking price is met. The Eotech has some wear marks but works perfectly. It is a genuine eotech. I will consider selling the rifle without the eotech but I would prefer to keep it all together. This is a truly amazing setup."

Description
The Mossberg 500 Pump Action Flyway Series Waterfowl is a pump-action hunting shotgun chambered in 12 gauge. The model 500 is a series of shotguns marketed as an inexpensive alternative for hunters, but the Flyway Series Waterfowl costs a little bit more than average at $485. What makes it different than the Waterfowl model is that it comes with different chokes. The Flyway uses ported chokes, so the gas pushing the pellets out will expel before the muzzle ultimately reducing the recoil. Otherwise it has a synthetic stock with a Real Tree finish. It has a vent rib barrel and fiber optic sights, which have bright colors that are easy to see. And, it has an ambidextrous safety. Mossberg recommends it for hunting waterfowl, of course.

This is a 1 5/8 inch barrel, is 5 3/8 inches in overall length, and weighs 6.2 ounces. It comes with both the 22 Magnum Cylinder and the 22 Long Rifle convertible cylinder. It also comes with a Sherpa lined gun rug and a in the waistband holster. You also get all of my 22 magnum rounds ( a bunch of cci hps and 8 cci shot shells) and I'll throw in a couple hundred Long Rifle rounds(if bought local).

NAA mini-revolvers are made in the USA of stainless steel with a nicely polished matte finish. All are single action (SA) revolvers with spur triggers. The cylinders hold 5 cartridges, and there are safety notches between the chambers into which the nose of the hammer (which is also the firing pin) can be lowered to allow safe carry with the cylinder fully loaded. The grip frames are of the ""bird's head"" type and most models come with attractive laminated wood grips. The sights on most models are rudimentary, consisting of a rounded front blade and the raised rear edge of the frame.

NAA mini-revolvers are so tiny that they are cute, but they are not toys. They are precisely made and very functional deep concealment pistols. And a mini-revolver can be concealed in the vest pocket of a three piece suit. To me it is the minimum satisfactory concealed carry handgun."

I believe this rifle currently retails for 1299 (according to ruger website) and the leupold vari-x iii scope is about 600.  I am listing at 1200, because I think thats an awesome trade value.  I also have and will include 10 boxes of Hornady .204 ammo ($160+ value)  I will also consider trading/selling the rifle by itself without the scope.    

Id be interested in hearing ANY trade offers just because I am curious. I am interested in getting a tactical rifle, or high end shotguns.  Also would consider a nice .270 or other common ammo deer rifle (may need cash or trade without the leupold) Im really not that interested in selling, but will also listen to cash offers.

I have A Stainless Steel Dan Wesson Ctg 357 Magnum Revolver.

(you can see the difference  between a Dan Wesson CTG and a Smith & Wesson in the second picture I have [the stainless one is the one for sale the blued smith and wesson is not] dan wesson on top smith on bottom)

It shoots the 357 magnum and also the less expensive 38 special round.
also has the spots where you can screw in a scope.

Im not interested in selling this gun, I love this gun im only interested in trading it, and If i dont get offered anything worth it Ill just keep it this is a great well made gun, a lot of people prefer it over colt ruger and smith and wesson.

this is a 6 shot revolver double and single action, these guns are able to change the barrels. when they first came out they came in a kit that came with a 2.5"", 4"", 6"" and your choice of a 8 or 10"" barrel. I am not the first owner so I only have one barrel with it which is the 4"" barrel.

This gun was made to compete with the well made Colt, Ruger, and Smith & Wesson revolvers and they are actual preferred over those brands. It is well made and very accurate fire arms.

I am not interested in Shot guns or Rifles. Im onlt interested in other Hand guns. Depending on what you im willing to to straight trade or trade + cash. also that being said depending on what you offer from you part I would like trade or trade + cash.

Again not interested in cash unless its something I cant say no to. But im inno rush to get rid of this. It such a nice gun im not worried about getting rid of it ill just keep it but if your interested let me know what you have

Selling an older Remington 700 BDL (wood stock) in 7mm Rem Mag with a blued stainless barrel, UTG Picatinny rail installed, and brand new Weaver (brand) Picatinny rail still in the packaging. The scope and rings shown are not included.

I picked it up several years ago after a co-worker passed, so do not know much about it's history. It has shot very well for me, but I just do not get to shoot her enough and have pretty much given up on the thought of anything like an elk hunt in the next decade.

There is some hunting / handling wear on the blueing and a few marks on the wood, but overall she still looks pretty good.

Note: A little more information on the wear shown in the pictures.

The barrel looks like the blueing has flaked slightly in some places, particularly close to the receiver. It is my understanding that this was somewhat common as the blueing process used at that time did not adhere very well on stainless steel. The surface is pretty smooth the touch (not pitted, from what I can tell) and there has been no discoloration from the stainless color shown as long as I got the rifle.

As far as the receiver, it looks like either a rub or a chemical has stripped the blueing. Again, it has not changed over the years I have had the rifle and the surface feels smooth."

I'm helping a friend sell his firearms from his extensive private collection. My friend has been a collector for many years. He has been a collector of both antique and recent production firearms. Most all will be higher end firearms. At this time he feels that he needs to sell many of his fine firearms. I have not seen all of his collection to date. I do know that he has many fine Colt SAA revolvers, Winchester lever action rifles, Remington shotguns and rifles, Ithaca doubles, L.C. Smith doubles, Lefever doubles, at least one Fox double and various Interarms, Savage, and Henry firearms. This is a preliminary list. The firearms will be listed for sale on Armslist.com as my friend is ready to sell them in the coming months. A meeting may be arranged to view his firearms at our convienence. I do not have any of his firearms at my residence. Any meeting will occur in a public area, not at his residence. I hope you appreciate the concern that he has with these precautions. He will also have many fine Case knives. Please search silverback for my additional listings."

Just on here offering a service for those that are interested.
 I refinish and restore wood rifle stocks
 Everything from shotguns, to hunting rifles and pistol grips to my specialties with AK style and SKS style stocks.
 Turn around time is normally around 1-2 weeks depending on how bad the stock is or what ""custom"" look you might like.
 When I do a stock I treat it as if it were my own. 
I start out by first prepping the wood by cleaning and bleaching it. 
Next I then fill in nicks and gouges (if you want that done)sand it and then stain the stock unless you want a natural finish. I put no less then 6 coats of stain on the stocks I do. I can do any color you would like. Red, Brown, Black even custom colors Gold pearl, purple, blue, etc...
 Then I apply a minimum of 8 coats of clear. (sheen, semi-gloss, or high gloss)

Prices start at $65 and go up depending on size of stock and condition.

Feel free to call or text me anytime

From Browning:
Short Action. Long Action. Ready for Any Action.
As a rule, lever-action aficionados have always had to trade away power and accuracy for quick handling and easy carrying. With the Browning BLR those compromises are a thing of the past. The design of the BLR is as modern as tomorrow with an aircraft-grade alloy receiver, glass-smooth rack and pinion system and multi-lug rotating bolt that handles many of the most popular magnum cartridges, including the fast new WSMs. The exceptional accuracy of the BLR comes from its precision machined, button-rifled barrel that puts those fast-stepping magnum bullets exactly where they're wanted. Add in the advantages of several great stock designs and finishes, a detachable box magazine, low profile adjustable sights and a wide, grooved trigger that travels with the lever to avoid pinching fingers and it's clear the Browning BLR is ready for any action."

Listen just mind your own business. Yes, it would be easier to everybody when you grade firearm according to old rules( like ""excellent, very good, good, poor conditions) and percentage of the finish left ,but sometimes there is exceptions to the rules.  1. May be weapon was fired just 50 rounds and it is common.You basically can not see difference from the new gun.  2. Not everybody buying at the same place and i will point to you several places here in Cleveland who  is selling guns at MSRP prices, which are higher and different from dealers who is making money by selling in volume and making $20-50 per gun or simply buying in very large volume. Just tired of reading about some place near Columbus area who is selling cheaper. So i will need to travel 150-200 miles there to buy a firearm? 3. Sometimes there is extras with weapon or may be seller forgot to mention extras. Or may be there was a trigger job done. 5th, but not last. Just like i said before mind your own business. Yes , sometimes i feel the same way as you , but if i don't like it i do not buy it. Simple as that. 6. If it is a big deal to somebody here or owners of this site  may be it is a better idea to create a discussion forum and discuss this matters there and save place here for selling and trading.7 Oh by the way. I remember when Makarov pistol was $130-140 at any store. Tokarev pistol was even cheaper $80 and up. Tokarev rifles was about $200. Now Maks are going from $275 to $900. Russian Tokarevs $800-1200. Some models of Tokarev rifles going up to $2000. And all of these prices depends on the condition of the gun and country where it was manufactured. I'am naming just cheapest weapons out there. And it does not matter what i and you feel about it or that weapon is not good from the beginning. Look at the SIG's and HK's. Overpriced from the start.

 * Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
 * The bolt of the VZ 2008 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
 * The VZ 2008 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
 * The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ 58.
 * The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ 2008.
 * The VZ 2008 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. 
* The alloy magazine of the VZ 2008 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lb. vs. .84 lb.)
 * VZ 2008 is easier to field strip.
 * The VZ 2008 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47.

I got rid of my truck and kept the tires and they wont fit on my new Ford. They have been sitting in the shed for a couple months and I need to make room for other stuff. I only took one out for pictures cause theyre a bit heavy, but they all look identical. The rims were almost $500 a piece new when I got them a couple years back. They show a little wear, not major, still polish up great. The tires were almost $2000 when I bought them.  All in all, to buy this new, youd pay almost $4000.

I am a C&R license holder & can get discounts on some websites like Graf & Sons. I'm pretty good at locating the best deals online & can help you search for any components you may need. I'm mainly interested in loading for 223 rem personally. I was looking for other people interested in reloading especially if you have an interest in 223 rem.

This is my first ARMSLIST posting & I would prefer contact through the site (as I should get an e-mail i believe) & if interested further I will then provide a contact number to reach me at.

Model .45 W/Box, Near-Mint Condition. Stock # MSH230313KT. Serial # SS22xxxE. One of MANY Colt 1911’s, both commercial and military we have for sale at Jackson Armory (please look at our other listings), this is an all-stainless steel Colt MK IV Series 80 Government Model 1911A1 .45 auto pistol. The pistol has polished flats and matte stainless slide top and undercarriage, and this is set off nicely with the factory black Pachmayr grips with silver-colored Colt Medallions- the pistol is as handsome as it is functional! The pistol has a 3-dot sighting system, and the desirable ring hammer. The magazine is Colt-marked,, and also stainless steel. The pistol has maybe been fired a few times, but it truly is in near-mint (97%) condition, and that includes the finish, grips, and the mint, shiny bore. The pistol comes with the original Colt factory box. This is an ideal 1911 for both Police Duty carry, and also concealed carry and home defense – there are a lot of 1911’s out there now, but it’s pretty hard to beat an original Colt!
