191,http://www.armslist.com/posts/803191,"For Sale:  ""Bart Starr"" Autographed Poster","Wisconsin, Wisconsin, United States",$ 90,"Listed On: Friday, May 10, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"16 x 20 size Poster of Bart Starr with Personalized Autograph from ""Just For Feet"". Its in Fair to Good condition, its not crisp but there is no Major bending or creases. Its been rolled and stored in a container for about 17 years.  

Steven happens to be my younger brother but he does not like football. I love football but Im a die-hard Seahawks and Texans fan. We went to 'Just For Feet' back in 1996 in the outskirts of Houston, TX and Bart Starr himself, happen to be doing a promotion there. There was a big wheel (similar to the one on Wheel of Fortune) that certain people would spin and whatever Packers item the wheel stopped on was the prize. My brother got a poster which was personalized to him by Mr. Starr. 

I know that memorabillia collectors prefer NON-Personalized items but this was signed by Bart Starr who happens to be a Packers Legend who won 2 Superbowls and 5 NFL Championships during the Lombardi Era. For those that are worried about authenticity, I assure you that the poster is 100% genuine. There is no certificate or letter of authenticity because this poster was basically taken off a stack of copies and was signed and handed out all by Bart Starr. I was there and witnessed the whole thing. Here is the exact same poster from someone else named 'Bill & Catherine' : http://www.ebay.com/itm/HOF-Bart-Starr-signed-poster-Green-Bay-Packers-football-/REDACTED57?pt=US_Football_Fan_Shop&hash=item2ead897ad1 

For those that dont know what ""Just For Feet"" was.... it is a now defunct sports retail superstore that sold athletic equipment including footwear. This was a unique retailer because they added a mini basketball court, many TV screens playing sporting events, played loud music and even had a hotdog and popcorn snackbar all inside the store for people to eat while they were shopping. They were big in the 90's but went bankrupt and finally dissolved in 2004. 

I do not live in Texas anymore nor Wisconsin. I live in Washington state but I can ship the poster to you upon payment. I can do paypal or money order, just let me know.

Thank You,

Brand new or like new. I am looking for the stainless upper slide EXO Hard Coat. I am trying to do write a review for one but my colleague has very little firearms knowledge much less wanting to call every AR customer busy gun store about buying a pistol (I think she's shy when it comes to the topic). No gun store seems interested in even checking stock or ordering me one. Which is the main premise of my article, how a great little gem of a company like MPA is turning out these wonderful products but they're not getting the national attention because of advertising dollars and other issues...but I digress. I am looking to purchase this one as my own, not for any company; this one I want to review and keep. Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated and I'm glad to exchange the small amount I get paid per word for this pistol rather than bother with requisition forms. My editor is not even supporting me in writing this and he is an organic, BUY LOCAL nut. What could be more LOCAL than Carolton?! If anyone sees this and knows Ms. Darah S. at MPA (usually they have great customer service but I imagine they have been slammed too) tell her to please send a bit of encouragement to someone to order me one or sell me one. If you get me a little further up the ladder in time for my deadline to write this, I will send you your own signed copy or unsigned if you want it to have more value  I am a GA resident and have my carry permit of course.
If I haven't convinced you yet to get your own of their line, then hopefully my better, written article will."

I bought it when it came out because it is the thinnest lightest 45 acp or perhaps the only 45 concealed carry pistol. It fits in your front pocket. 

I took it out and shot a box of ammo through it. Since it is a carry piece I did not target shoot with it all day. However, it is very accurate and easy to shoot so I didnt need to waste a lot of ammo to get used to it and hit my targets. it shoots softer than many 380 pocket pistols, such as bodyguard and lcp. Red fiber optic sight is very bright and clear. When you draw down you will want to have the biggest hardest hitting round for stopping power. This breakthrough and high tech design is an amazing pistol that is only 1"" thick. It is identical in size to the 9mm walther PPS and MP Shield.

It comes with the factory case with cut foam fit, mag holster, lock, 2 mags, factory test proof. 

ALSO IT COMES WITH THE EXTENDED 7 RD MAGAZINE. This mag extends the grip an inch lower so you have more to grip. these are 38$ before tax. 

So although my prices is not rock bottom. You are getting a practically new gun, all the stuff it comes from the factory and a significant savings. 550 is a modest retail price some are up to 575 some 520. true retail is 599. 
so tke that plus 38 dollars for the must have extra extended mag. and minus tax my askin price of 500$ is around 100$ savings if you were to go out and buy this."

Thank you for any offers.  If your offer is really low I may not be able to reply.  When this ammo was available prior to the mad rush it was $552 for 1200 rounds; plus shipping.  I am not desperate to sell so loosing money selling something scarce...  This ammo is premium ammo for self defense.

goal and on the fact how they are operated. Traditional form of these lights are powered by 

electricity. The strategy of installing them is not that hard meaning you can do it by 

yourself but once that they are connected it is not that simple to move them. They are 

based on electricity source so locations for placing them are limited.

A different type of outdoor string lights are battery controlled type. Their feature is you 

can easily replace them but battery pack changing will cost you. Solar string lights are 

maybe the right choice you can make. The sun powers them so they will cost you nothing 

except buying them. They are easily moved from one place to another because they are free 

of wires. Solar string lights came with board that needs to be placed on the day light to 

get the natural light while strings can be left in the shadow of some tree.

For more enjoyable and more events like decorating for birthday parties, you can find 

novelty string lights that came in unusual designs like chili peppers and I have seen even 

some dinosaurs. Just be sure that they are for outer use, don't be carried away.

Exterior string lights are something that coats every celebration no matter what the 

occasion is. They are inexpensive, easy to set up and make everyone feel happy. That is 

their main point. If you have not tested it yet go for it soon.

One magazine included. Buyers choice of 126mm, or 140mm length.
Possible trades: M&P, 5"", Pro, or 9L, West German, Sig, 226, in 9mm, jacketed bullets, in 9mm, .40, or 45, AA, or STS target loads in 20, or 12 gauge.

The listed $1,295 price is for a local, face to face transaction, although I would ship at additional cost to buyer."

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

Asking price is $2000 for all, so you save a couple hundred if you buy the whole package. Unless otherwise noted, will not remove individual components for individual sale.   Will consider trade or trade cash mix.  All reasonable trade offers considered, however lowballers will be ignored.  Please consider my asking price before presenting your offer.

I would be interested in the following (would require both trade and cash combined or multiples of the following):

Tactical precision rifles (Remington 700 SPS Tactical very much preferred)

Sub Compact 1911 (Glock, Springfield, Sig Sauer, etc) in .40 or .45 cal

Tactical 12ga Shotgun

AR10 Lowers

Break Up Rifle

UPDATE:  I expect this AR will be sold by EOD 1.10.12 as I have received multiple competitive offers which has convinced me to lower my listed price so as to encourage any others who may be on the fence.  Please let me know if you have any questions!"
