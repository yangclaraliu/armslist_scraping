It has been in my family for many years but, due to some financial circumstances, I find myself forced to sell. I'm not an expert in such matters, but I'd rate the gun approx. 85% in finish and 95% in function (I've only had it to the range a small handful of times in 10 years and have had three failure-to-eject using cheap ball ammo). There is some wear shown in the bluing on the outside of the gun on the slide, but overall it's in fantastic shape for its age and could easily be made perfect by a bluing/restoration specialist. It is being sold with one original magazine.

Below is a link containing a lot of information on the particular model (including fun facts like General Patton used to carry one in WWII). As per the standards described on the site, the gun was manufactured between 1918-1921 and would make an excellent piece for a collector. The same model listed on Gunbroker without reserves are priced between $650-$1100 but I will take the best reasonable offer. I know there are some people out there that like to email and offer 50% of the asking price-- if this is you, please save both of us the trouble and don't do it. I do have some things I need to take care of, but I will not just give the gun away. In addition, I will consider partial trades of subcompact semi-autos (KelTec, Ruger, etc) or even possibly a Derringer.

Please don't hesitate to email me with any questions, specific picture requests, etc. If, for some reason, I cannot get the pictures to load on the ad I'll be happy to email them to you.

Thanks a lot!

This is a good, functioning, historical rifle. Uses the 303 British cartridge. Comes with original bayonet.

The rifling is good and meets spec, and the bluing is still very much in tact. Tolerances have been checked and the gun has been test fired. The rifle functions fine and shoots straight. The serials don't match, so that makes this gun a little less valuable than say a completely original Enfield so that's why i'm asking $150. The fact is this rifle was probably used in battle, so when a part needed replacing they had to use what was available to the armorer. 

The wood is all there but it's a little dinged up. However, you're going to find that on an 80 year old war relic. The cool thing is it looks like a soldier carved a couple of things into the stock. I don't think that makes it a super-valuable gun but if you are into war history items, this is a very cool little find if you ask me."

Ponsness/Warren reloaders use a full-length resizing die for the shells. The shell is held inside the die during the entire loading process, which produces a finished shell that is perfectly sized for cycling through any type of shotgun. The finished shells are superior to those produced by MEC reloaders. Fast, solid, durable. 
As you can in the photos, some rust has taken hold. Bought this used several years ago with the intent to eventually buy a 28ga shotgun for skeet shooting. It’s much cheaper to reload 28ga shotshells than reloading 12ga. The 28ga shotgun never happened and seems unlikely too. This loader is taking up space and collecting dust and it might as well go to someone who will actually use it. What you see in the photos is what you get, no extras of any kind. Essentially still in pretty much the same condition as when I bought it. Maybe a little more rust and dust. 
View the youtube video (link attached) to see just how quickly you can reload your shells with this thing. One freshly loaded shell for every full rotation of the slot machine type lever.  These sell for $900 brand new from the manufacturer. I’m selling this one for $500. Check out other used ones on ebay or elsewhere, if you can find them at all.
For pickup only. This sucker is heavy and I'm not going to attempt to package it for shipping.

I am not selling mine, but I thought I would share the information as they go for $449.00 to $499.00 on line.  

No I do not work for Sportsman's Warehouse, I just thought I would share this good pricing.

Review - a few days with the Stallion; The pistol needed quite a bit of cleaning out of the box, from the inside out.  The action felt a little ""gunky"", and the cylinder rubbed against the frame.  I put a a 100 rounds of magnum through it at the range and it seams to have loosened up. The action feels much better, and after a second cleaning, is very bright and crisp.  The blueing is not a resilient as the Colt's, but I guess you get what you pay for.  This revolver is very accurate with almost no recoil.  

I was looking for something that had the same action as my Colt 45 lc, but much cheaper to shoot.  For the price, this fits the bill.  I don't know that I would have been happy paying $499.00, but for $299.00 I am pleased."

All of the items show varying degrees of use but all remain in at the very least good condition with some leaning more towards VG. There is basically an entire vintage shotshell reloading setup here, pretty cool to see it all together. 

As a lot im looking to get $325 for these items. 


The pictures I enclosed are just to help get a picture of the items. I have some more detailed ones available if need be.

ShotgunWorld per my request for assistance as value: You have a Franchi AL-48. It is one of the better upland guns ever made. From your description, I'd value it at between $300-375. The 48 is no longer available in 12 gauge so that makes it a bit more valuable. If you can get $400, do it. I'm thinking that you'll settle for around $375 or a bit less. It is a 2 3/4"" chambered gun."

It comes with it's brown belt grain leather belt sheath and is in perfect condition. Not a single scratch on it. The only mark is on the sheath itself from the knife's tip being too sharp and getting caught on it on it being pulled out and put back in. A tiny nick that created an imprint of a blade. Other than that, this blade and case are perfection. I don't want to get rid of it, but it's going towards a different cause; a gun.  I have a lot of knives and a good rifle, but just no good handgun for home protection. And where I live it's a necessity. Anyway, the price is not negotiable, but you won't find one for the price or the condition this one is in anywhere. Looking forward to making a deal with anyone interested. Thank you!

This revolver has the most beautiful blueing I have ever seen on any S&W revolver. It is a deep blue/black lustre finish that rivals, or supasses what you may expect to find on a comparable condition early model Colt Python. Suffice it to say, the pictures do not do justice to this incredible revolver. Aside from a barely noticable turn line, the fit and finish is near perfect (99.9%). The weapon is in used condition however, I do not have the original box or papers - sorry. That aside, this will make a handsome addition to any S&W collection and will likely not be seen again."

I really need some new DJ equipment, specifically a MAC laptop, preferably a power book. I am not going to sell this gun, I love it too much, but if you have something to trade along the lines of what I mentioned, please get in touch. 

This Saiga HAS NOT had the trigger conversion yet. I planned on doing that but I haven't gotten around to it. 

Initially the Saiga was having some issues with FTEs. Typically a Saiga needs about 200 high brass rounds, slugs put through them to break them in. Slugs arent cheap and I was sick of the FTEs so I bought the low brass kit from carolina shooters. 

The low brass kit consists of a new spring, a new gas puck, and a 5 position gas adjuster (stock Saigas have 2 positions). This was supposed to allow me to skip the break in period and have the ability to cycle birdshot and cheap rounds when I wanted to save some money. 

A note to potential Saiga owners (the low brass kit will not necessarily solve your problems - I still had FTE problems after the installation)

This Saiga has 3 gas ports, all are clear and visible. I started to polish the bolt but I haven't finished that yet. The gun is shown with a UTG quad rail system with a Tapco T6 stock and a foregrip. 

The gun has a 5 round magazine and a 10 round magazine. 

I hit the 200 slug break in period a couple weeks ago and suddenly the gun became a dream to shoot. The gun will cycle slugs, buckshot, and cheap bird-shot like a champ. This past weekend I brought it to the range in Racine and tested out various rounds from hollow point slugs, 00 Buck, PDX1 Home Defense rounds, Bernake K.O. slugs - all cycled perfectly. I tore through 20 rounds as fast as I could pull the trigger. The people in the range were a bit annoyed so I stopped, but the gun would have functioned perfectly all day. 

I am looking for an AR style gun. I am open to other offers, but that is what I am really interested in."

Sportsman's Oil, once you use it, 
you will not want to use any other.
Do not settle for any thing else!

$360.95 5 Gal. Liquid Can Sportsmans oil

Ballistol is all-natural, non-toxic and does not lose its ability to lubricate even when mixed with water. Cleans black powder residue and is not petro-chemical based, so it will not affect a ""seasoned"" muzzleloader or black powder cartridge gun.
Notes:Many Uses

Protects Guns (also dissolves traces of copper, lead, brass and black powder residues)
Neutralizes Acids and Acidic Residues
Emulsifies with Water for Dilution, yet Holds its Properties
Protects Wood, Leather, Plastic, Rubber

BALLISTOL dissolves traces of lead, copper, zinc, brass and tombac, which are used to make projectiles and jackets for them. Residues of these metals will remain in the bore of any firearms as a result of shooting jacketed or unjacketed lead projectiles. The use of BALLISTOL makes scraping or brushing the bore unnecessary. Just pour or spray enough into the barrel and chamber, turn the firearm around several times to allow the liquid to reach all parts and let it ""go to work"". Later, the residues will then completely be cleaned out.

Due to its alkaline character BALLISTOL is ideal for cleaning and maintaining black powder firearms. BALLISTOL eliminates the need for brutal mechanical scrubbing and aggressive solvents. 
Of course, you should also use BALLISTOL to treat your holsters, belts and carrying slings.

FIREARMS - Cleans & dissolves traces of copper, lead, brass, zinc, & tombac. Lubricates & protects firearms, lock, stock & barrel. Forms a film that protects against rust. Will never gum-up or harden. Ideal for pistol grips, & rifle stocks.

BLACK POWDER - Dissolves black powder residues. Emulsifies with water. Mildly alkaline, neutralizes acids. Excellent patch lube.

LEATHER - Use on boots, shoes, gloves, holsters, slings, & saddles. Protects leather against water. Keeps leather soft & pliable, will darken lighter colors. Do not use on suede.

KNIVES & TOOLS - Lubricates, cleans, & protects metal, plastic, rubber, & wood. Outstanding penetrating oil, creeps into the finest cracks, loosens nuts & bolts. Also use as a cutting/boring oil (20:1). 

MARINE - Use in motor compartments, on joints, links, wire pulls, & around battery terminals. Protects electrical contacts. Beautifies faded gel coats. Lubricates zippers, push buttons, & winches. Great for fishing rods, reels, & tackle. Protects Aluminum, prevents pitting.

ROAD & TRAIL - Lubricates autos, motorcycles, bicycles, rollerblades, skateboards, skis, & sports equipment. Protects all camping gear.

This excellent Winchester Model 101 was made in 1964 and has obviously been well cared for.  It has a 26"" set of barrels and is chambered for the 2 3/4"" 12 Gauge with fairly open chokes(SK), perfect for doves, quail, or skeet. It locks up tight and has proven 100% reliable in the 500 or so rounds I've personally run through it during the last few years I've owned it. Excellent condition inside and out, with the recoil pad (perhaps) the only non-factory modification. Length of pull from the butt to the single trigger is 14 1/4"". It balances ans shoots GREAT but, as nice as it is, I cannot justify hanging onto it as I already own and shoot a Beretta OU. The Model 101 is a true classic, but like so many of the greats they have been long gone for many years now.

[quote]  The Mauser C96 is a semi-automatic pistol that was originally produced by German arms manufacturer Mauser from 1896 to 1937. Unlicensed copies of the gun were also manufactured in Spain and China in the first half of the 20th century.

The main distinctive identifying characteristics of the C96 are the integral box magazine in front of the trigger, the long barrel, the wooden shoulder stock which can double as a holster or carrying case, and a grip shaped like the handle of a broom. The grip's distinctive appearance earned the gun the nickname ""Broomhandle"" in the English-speaking world, and in China the C96 was nicknamed the ""box cannon"" because of both its square-shaped internal magazine and the fact it could be holstered in its wooden box-like detachable stock.

The Mauser C96, with its shoulder stock, long barrel and high-velocity cartridge, had superior range and better penetration than most other standard pistols; the [b]7.63x25mm Mauser[/b] cartridge was the highest velocity commercially manufactured pistol cartridge in existence until the advent of the .357 Magnum cartridge in 1935.

Approximately 1 million C96 pistols were manufactured by Mauser alone,[8] with the number produced in Spain and China being large but unknown due to the loss, non-existence, or poor upkeep of production records from those countries

I prefer a gun with an exposed hammer, but will consider something with a striker type firing pin.  The pistols I've owned in the past have all been exposed hammer types, and I'm just more comfortable being able to visually see if it's cocked.  I know this is mostly a psychological thing, so it's possible, I could be talked out of this.  The gun must be in good operating condition, but does not have to be cosmetically perfect.  Since it's for home defense, a small, concealed carry model is not necessary, but I would consider one.  I have a pistol permit, and do not wish to travel far outside the Triangle area.

In case you're unfamiliar with the CZ-70, it was the standard Czech police sidearm that was manufactured from 1970 though 1983.  It is an improved version of the CZ-50, which was itself closely copied from the Walther PP.  It is chambered in 7.65 mm (.32 ACP) and employs a blowback mechanism.

Prefer FTF transaction.  Must present government ID showing you are a resident of Ohio of legal age to purchase a handgun.
