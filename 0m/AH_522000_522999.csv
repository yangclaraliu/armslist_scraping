Gun is in great shape, I always keep it clean and oiled up. Barrel is clean and smooth. There are a few small scratches but you don't even notice them unless I point them out. These are built like tanks. All steel, heavy, and powerful shooters. No box or manuals. Asking $420 which I feel is fair since they sell over $700 new. If you're looking to trade, I'm only interested in trades with other Ruger or Smith & Wesson revolvers.  

I will only sell to those who have a conceal carry license or a pistol purchase permit and valid driver license, and be willing to sign a bill of sale. I just want to make sure to abide by laws and not sell to someone who can't own a firearm. Contact me if interested."

317,http://www.armslist.com/posts/522317,For Sale:  AR15 pre ban mags for sale or trade,"Pendleton, Buffalo, New York",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, August 19, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have 2 pre ban 40 round mags I am looking to sell outright for cash, or negotiate a trade for pre ban 20 round mags. 

Both mags were new in the bag when I got them. I have used the one with the yellow magpul follower that I put in it. The finish is near perfect on this one, and is perfect on the other. I do not see any date stamps on them, and the floor plates are blank as well, but I think that means they have to be preban, as the ""ban"" and ""post ban"" ones would have to have dating or at least writing on them. The guy I bought them from said he bought a case of them back in the early 90's (before 93)
I only paper target shoot with my AR anymore, so I really don't need 40 rounds! They are definitely cool to have, and a conversation piece as they really do look like a ""bananna clip"" as the ignorant would call them. These are hard to find and don't come up for sale that often... look at all of the pre ban 30's for sale lately... you don't see these guys selling any 40's! $80 for the pair or $45 each 

Trades are also welcome. I am preferably looking for pre ban 20 rounders, but might consider pre ban 30 rounders depending on what they are (brand, date or no date, etc.)

Great gun, shoots great, never had any issues with this rifle. I bought it from my father in law about four years ago. This gun has been well cared for and cleaned regularly. 

The main reason I am looking to trade, I have way to many different types of ammunition, and I need to condence into maybe five or six calibers.

The calibers I am interested for include .308/7.62 NATO, .40 S&W, .223, .22, 12ga, & .410. I have plenty of all except the .308, so that is where I prefer to trade.

What I am most interested in... Remington 700 chambered in .308. I am more interested in the rifle than the accessories. Nice stocks, high powered scopes, and smooth bi-pods are nice, but I am pretty picky and will most likely want to replace them anyways, and I am looking to keep the trade fairly even for a straight up trade.

Chambered in 30-30, this firearm is somewhat of an interesting find. This was made in the 1980's, with features such as a hooded front sight and a shorter barrel giving it the classification of a ""Ranger"" Model 94. However, this Winchester does not have a crossbar safety, unlike the overwhelming majority of firearms, including other Model 94's, manufactured during this time period. 

This firearm has rarely been used and is in great condition. Beautiful bore, wood, and the bluing is like new. The action is very smooth and has been well maintained, making it a lot of fun to shoot. I am looking to sell soon, so I am willing to consider offers and work with you. If you are interested, please feel free to send me an email or give me a call at REDACTED. Thank you."

It has been developed with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use. The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position. This pistol is used although only has had maybe 150 rounds through her just to make sure everything was working fine. Selling to buy more stuff for AR.

After the Aurora shooting, President Obama stated ""But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals. That they belong on the battlefield of war, not on the streets of our cities."" 

On July 25th, Mitt Romney had this to say about ""assault rifles"" when he stated, ""These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense, they are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people.” 

No matter who is in office, I think this will be our last chance to own these type of weapons. This is my opinion and you are welcome to come to your own conclusion!, so get this one before we get too close to the election date and prices start going up!

It aslo comes with the original owners manual and cleaning rod (many don't come with the cleaning rod).  Barrel length is approx 12"" with an overall length of just over 21"".  Since this is a pistol, it is exempt from 922r compliance rules so there are no american made parts inside this gun.  This is exactly how it came off the assembly line (except I changed out the pistol grip from the ugly brown one to the black one shown).

This saiga has had the trigger group moved forward and the trigger has been upgraded to a tapco trigger. It also has a tapco black wood stock as well. This saiga runs flawlessly and has never had any issues functioning. This saiga is just like any AK should be. It is extremely reliable and shoots tight groups at 100 yards. Included is one ten round magazine. I prefer a cash sale but I will considered some trades. This saiga is well worth my asking price. I have seen them sell for much more. If you are looking for a beautiful russian akm then look no further. I am downsizing my collection a bit so this one must go. The round count is low and it has never had any issues. This is an amazing AK. Please no lowball offers. Cash is king. Thanks for looking.
