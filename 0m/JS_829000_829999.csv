I am looking for a larger handgun. Would like either a .38 special, .40, .45 or 10mm preferably but may be open to other offers. I would prefer a straight across trade. As far as just selling it out right it would have to be for a good offer.

2 boxes of shells have been shot through this gun - 25 per barrel.
There is a scratch in the grip area of the stock, and a rub mark in the bluing on one barrel (moving company didn't wrap it properly). Otherwise the gun is in great shape... It's just been sitting in the safe too long and needs to go to a home where it will be enjoyed.
It doesn't have a recoil pad from the factory, so I've added a slip-on LimbSaver that will go with the gun.

I can also top this off with a Thompson Center 3-9x40 muzzleloader scope with Gorilla rings and bore-sight it for a total of $345

Simplicity is Elegance

Its sleek profile and “sealed pivoting breech” lever action design make this muzzleloader one of the simplest on the market. Simple to operate, simple to clean.

Sealed, Pivoting Breech Design

The Z5’s unique action operates by using the forward motion of the trigger guard lever to pivot the breech block downward, allowing easy access to the 209 primer pocket. This closed breech design seals the 209 primer away from rain, snow or sleet.

Super Reliable

The Z5 is a closed breech muzzleloader, which protects the 209 primer from foul weather. Its sealed breech plug is specifically designed to avoid the problem of crushing Pyrodex® Pellets, which could cause a misfire.

Magnum Capabilities for Long Range Shooting

The Z5 can handle 150 grains of Black Powder or Pyrodex equivalent, or three 50 grain Pyrodex® pellets. The Z5 offers flatter trajectories and increased down range energy."

The Huldra Mark IV Tactical Elite’s patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The mid-length piston system will give you the benefits of a longer free float forearm (with anti-rotational tabs) and extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you a longer, more ergonomic grip, as well as a longer sight radius between the front and rear sights for quicker acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome. The 4.5 pound JP Trigger (a $259.95 value) gives you a perfectly crisp, precise break and extremely short reset. The complete absence of take-up and over-travel provides the best combination of speed and precision on the market. The ambidextrous safety allows you to flip off the safety on either side of the weapon. The rugged Mil-Spec Vltor IMod Stock has an extremely comfortable superior cheek weld with a non-slip removable butt pad. Each side compartment of The Vltor IMod can hold two AA or three lithium CR123 3-volt batteries and accepts a push-button, quick detachable sling swivel. The Ergo Grip is solid and comfortable. Its superior texture reduces slippage, even while wearing gloves and is virtually impervious to oils and solvents.

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical tooling dimensions held within ±.001"" and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control.

Fool me twice, shame on me."" This week the media is trying to convince us that support for Senator Feinstein's anti-gun legislation is weak, but if we are not PRO-ACTIVE, the legislation will pass as written. You will wake up just in time for SHOT Show with new laws that make your AR-15 a Class 3 weapon. This means that if you want to keep your tactical rifles, you will have to register them, pay a $5-$200 tax, and notify the government if you intend to take them out of state. You will also completely waive your 4th Amendment rights to reasonable search and seizure. ATF will have the right to knock on your door and inspect the weapons anytime they want. You will also see an end to standard capacity magazines. This isn't a threat. It isn't political posturing. Diane Feinstein and the anti-gun machine have already introduced the legislation, and it will be rammed through Congress and signed by the President if we do not Stand As One and act today. 

Please contact your legislators immediately, and post the links above to your discussion boards. Also please contact all of the gun companies you do business with and ask them to take action now and don't sit on their resources in reaching out to the gunowners of America. All of them have mailing lists, and all of them are sitting on them pretending that they don't have any responsibility, while doing record business in the stuff that is going to be banned or regulated. This 2nd Amendment crisis is not about KA-CHING. We call out to Midway USA, Gunbroker, Brownells, Sportsmen's Guide, Cabelas and all the firearms and accessory manufacturers. If you have a list, use it. We must Stand As One if we are to defeat this threat to our freedom. Aside from one NRA-ILA email notifying us about the legislation, even the NRA has been silent. Facebook isn't enough. Our testing has shown that the effectiveness of Facebook is very small. You MUST EMAIL YOUR LISTS THIS WEEK before the legislation gains public support. We are about to enter a dark time in 2nd Amendment freedom and political wrangling from the NRA isn't going to cut it this far out from an election. The legislators need to hear from us, that we will work to defeat them in their next election bid. 

This is not an alarmist position. The anti-gun machine was prepared for this opportunity, and they are very well organized. Senator Feinstein herself admitted that she has been working since last year to investigate all of the loopholes from the last ""Assault Weapons Ban"" and eliminate them. That means that this time there will be no thumbhole stocks, no sawed off flashhiders, no California ""bullet buttons."" It is almost as though the anti-gunners allowed the old ban to end in hopes of making a better one this time. This legislation is extremely comprehensive and if it passes, every tactical rifle in America will instantly become a Class 3 weapon. No new guns will be produced at all, effectively shuttering every AR-15 manufacturer in the country. 

Don't be fooled by the pollsters this time, for or against. They key point in this legislation is that we are more than a year from the start of the next campaigns for the mid-term elections. The anti-gun lobbyists, as you read this, are contacting the House and Senate members trying to convince them that American voters are not going to punish them for voting for new and sweeping gun control. Few politicians actually stand for anything, so how we react is paramount to defeating this legislation. You must notify your legislators that you are watching their vote and that you will work to defeat them in their next election bid if they vote for any new gun legislation that comes out of the Sandy Hook shootings. Over 500 people have been killed in Chicago this year, the most gun restrictive city in the USA. We will not sacrifice our 2nd Amendment rights because the media is up in arms about the slaughter of 20 white kids by a mentally disturbed individual who stole his mommy's guns. 

Also don't think that the Supreme Court is going to help us on this one. The legislation clearly identifies the approach to grandfathered weapons as a tax, and the Supreme Court has recently dealt with this issue on Obamacare, and refused to strike it down. Our swing vote, the George W. Bush appointed Justice Stevens, has already demonstrated that he will not strike down major legislation from the bench if he can find a way to avoid it, and this tax approach to our guns won't even make the Supreme Court. You may think that the original 2nd Amendment guaranteed us the right to the same guns at the government (muskets at the time), but there is plenty of Federal case law from the 1986 machinegun ban that has laid the groundwork for this Feinstein bill. It will pass, and it will stand. 

If we Stand As One this week, the legislation will be stopped. Please contact your reps in the House and your Senators today. Mobilize your friends and family. Email everyone in your contact list. And most importantly post the direct links above (not to GunsAmerica) to every single discussion board, blog or forum to which you frequent. 

As we have tried to explain already, GunsAmerica is all alone out here in this fight. Please encourage the gun websites you do business with to join our Stand As One campaign and email their mailing lists to fight this game changing legislation. We are all NRA Life and Endowment members here at GunsAmerica, yet nothing has come from NRA. Our competitors Gunbroker have sent nothing, apparently content with the spike in business. Midway USA has a huge list, yet nothing has come from them. Brownells is in the news for selling 3 1/2 years of magazines in one day, yet nothing has come from their email list. And worst of all, Cheaper Than Dirt actually announced that they would stop selling guns online, supporting the public opinion against our guns. Sportsman's Guide even had the nerve to send a happy go lucky ""After Christmas"" sale email on AR-15 accessories. Don't boycott these companies. Contact these companies! We have to stand together or we are going to lose. Now is not the time to argue and sit on our resources of huge email lists to America's gun enthusiasts. We Stand As One!

Some of you got upset at us calling Alex Jones a turd in the punchbowl of 2nd Amendment freedom, but it is the truth. The conspiracy theory websites do not stand with us on this one, though they claim that they do. A lot of young people are caught up in a conspiracy theory mindset that is preventing them from seeing the forest through the trees. 2nd Amendment rights were never about hunting, and there has always been an out in the open ""conspiracy"" against them. if you espouse big government control and oversight of all Americans, you obviously don't want free thinkers to be armed. It doesn't take a conspiracy theorist to figure out that Diane Feinstein wants to watch and control all Americans, and disarming us is an important step for her and her ilk. Alex Jones and his gang may seem well intentioned, but what they really want is internet traffic. They want to sell you the movies and the water purifiers and the survival food and the male enhancement pills, PERIOD. Guns are just the latest thing on the conspiracy theory bandwagon because it ""gets the buzz going."" They may be gun loving Americans at heart, but what is driving them today is the almighty but ever weakening $$$ dollar. 

Diane Feinstein doesn't care how much survival food you have in your bunker . But what she does have is the actual power to halt the production of an entire class of firearms and magazines, and she plans to do that, this week. Get out of your armchair and get into action. 

This quote from a recent article in the Russian newspaper Pravda urging us to not give up our 2nd Amendment freedom says a great deal:

Do not be fooled by a belief that progressives, leftists hate guns. Oh, no, they do not. What they hate is guns in the hands of those who are not marching in lock step of their ideology. They hate guns in the hands of those who think for themselves and do not obey without question. They hate guns in those whom they have slated for a barrel to the back of the ear.

When the service was over I went to my truck that was parked in the parking lot behind the building. When I arrived my back glass had been busted out and my Martin acoustic guitar ""that was given to me by my mother,"" was stollen along with my brand new 30/30 Marlin that my grandparents bought me. Both of these items were very dear to me. This is a long shot, but if maybe you, or someone you know has gotten out of hunting or guns I would be so great full to have one to take my son hunting one day. I really can't afford much, but maybe we can work something out. I would be glad to work for it. I would really like 30-06, 270, 7mm or like. Thanks for reading my post and God bless!"

It uses the exact same ammunition that the AK-47 uses. Whether you want to shoot at beer cans, stand off a squad of ""zombies,"" or knock down a deer, this will definitely do the job for you!"
