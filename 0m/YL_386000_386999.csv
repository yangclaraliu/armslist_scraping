CZ 2075 RAMI is a sub-compact semi-automatic based on the proven CZ 75 line of pistols. The trigger mechanism operates in selective DA and SA mode depending on the shooter’s preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block and a manual safety. Incorporating the CZ double-stack magazine design, the little RAMI accommodates 10 rounds of 9mm Luger, or 7 rounds of 40 S&W, plus 1 in the chamber. With a 3” barrel, and unloaded weight of less than 26 ounces, the black polycoat, alloy frame RAMI is ideal for concealed carry.

I have a brand new SEMI-AUTO AGP Arms lower (minus stock body and buffer/spring) that's been professionally Duracoated by a Lauer Custom Weaponry certified refinisher. 

The 7075 T6 aluminium lower has been refinished Magpul foliage green with Duracoat's flattening agent for an ultra flat finish. The castle nut and KNS pins were Arevoed foliage green and match the overall finish nicely. Castle nut is cleanly staked to end plate. What's also cool about this lower is the American flag engraving on the front of the magwell and the select fire H&K style pictogram markings.

It also has a Magpul MIAD foliage green grip.

I am not including a stock body and buffer, since those are personal preference things. This lower has a mil-spec diameter stock tube.

All lower parts are Stag and brand new. Pmags (not included) drop freely. 

The lower was mounted to a Sabre Defence upper and test fired. Lower functions perfectly. It's super tight against three separate uppers I have tried.

Extra MIAD accessories included. 

I can ship the lower your FFL ($15 ship fee, plus make sure your dealer will accept a firearm from a non-licensed person), or we can do a FTF in a public setting in the Kingsport area (legal residents of Tennessee only). Out of state buyers must go through an FFL, per ATF interstate sales rules. For FTF I may ask to see your TN driver's license or state ID.

Obviously no sales to minors, felons, or anyone who cannot legally own this firearm.

Payment methods: U.S. Postal Money Order (mailed) or cash (FTF). No checks, sorry.

Serious buyers only. All sales are final.

Attached are some pictures of the actual lower. If you have questions or would like more photos, feel free to email me via the ""contact seller"" button. Thanks for looking. 










------- Manufacturer Description ---------

Our lower receivers begin from a 7075 T6 aluminum forging that are mic’d and sorted into batches to ensure uniformity. We always use the same forgings from one specific die to ensure all machined features land exact on the forging. This also makes it possible for us to machine away the forging lines and give a clean appearance.

All machining is performed in-house at our facility in Tempe, AZ on new top-of-the-line CNC equipment. We aren’t just slapping our name on the side of a receiver built by the lowest bidder. Other ‘manufacturers’ bounce around from supplier to supplier for better pricing or quicker lead times, and this of course gives varying degrees of quality and consistency. We build these in-house to ensure the buck starts and stops here, and if you have any sort of problem we can remedy it on the spot. The machines are screaming in the background even as I type this. AGP Arms has set the new standard of quality to the AR market.

We hold many of the critical dimensions to much higher standards than just meeting print. All of our holes are not just within the margin of error, they are perfect in location and diameter even after anodizing. No corners are cut buy drilling the hard-to-get to holes extra shallow like I’ve seen many others do. How the holes are drilled, directly effects how hard it is to put the lower together. The often undersized holes for the trigger guard make it much more likely you will break off a trigger guard ear while trying to force a .130” diameter roll pin into a .124” anodized hole. The AGP lower goes together like butter.

All of our engraving is CNC milled in; no roll marking or stamping. It’s all a nice uniform depth and the pictogram selector markings on the left and right side of the receiver line up properly around the safety hole and aren’t all goofy shaped. Our engraving is simply the best you will find. Notice that we engrave the American Flag (with all 50 stars) in the front of the magwell.

Our magwells are a real source of pride as it is one of the hardest features and certainly the most commonly screwed up by other manufactures. We simply skip right to the best method and Wire EDM them because no other method even comes close. It is by far the most expensive way to do it but as I’ve stated, we don’t cut corners. Magpul PMAGs drop free every time. We also guarantee every receiver we make will have a nice big chamfer for smooth, fast reloads. You will get a perfect magwell every time period.

These are machined ‘low shelf’ DIAS compatible. Anodizing is true Type III hard anodize per mil spec. They are a very flat black. This makes for a perfect match to RRA and other non glossy uppers. We incorporated an adjustable set screw to remove trigger pre-travel. You can access this screw even after fully assembling the lower with the hex wrench that passes between the pistol grip and trigger guard.

There are a hundred different minor details that we incorporate to make these the best receivers you can buy. This quality and degree of perfection certainly puts AGP at the top of the AR receiver heap. In an effort to earn the public’s trust and prove that these receivers are as good as we say they are, we are offering them to you for an introductory price to ‘get the word out’. Please give us the opportunity to impress you."

I have a few Older handguns that are just sitting and I am thinking they should be in someones collection that can appreciate them more. Maybe even shoot them. Although I have shot the only semiauto in the collection. I would prefer to not split them up. But I am open to just about anything. Let me know what you want. 

On to the good stuff.

I have a Deutsch Werke Ortiges pocket pistol in 7.65mm (32acp). I bought a new firing pin and found an original Ortgies magazine for it. The grips were gone so I made a pair out of some walnut I had. The grips came out really nice. I spent a lot of time on them. The Ortgies has been chromed at some point in it life. The action is pretty good. Not a bad little shooter. I should probably keep it with as much time I have spent on it. Shoot me an offer.

I also have a Forehand Arms breaktop 6 shot revolver in 32S&W. It has the original nickel finish and looks amazing. Grips are in excellent condition. A really nice old revolver. The barrel is a little dark but rifling is good. Would make a nice addition to any collection. The gunsmith I had look at it said it should be fine to shoot as the action is tight.

I have a Howard Arms Co. Breaktop revolver in 38S&W. It is a 5 shot revolver and is hammerless. It has a nice patina. Barrel is a little dark also but rifling is clearly visible. The grips on this one do not match I believe. They are Iver Johnson with the little owl on them. They are white. The action is tight and the gunsmith I had look at it said it would be fine to shoot.

The last item is the American Bull Dog. It is the large frame revolver in 44 Webley and 44 bulldog. This one is in pretty rough condition. Rust spots and the bore is dark and not really any visible rifling. I believe the hammer was ground off as well to make it snag free. Action it tight on this one though. The left grip has a chip on the corner. Look at the photos. 

I am open to just about any trades. I just want something different. Let me know what you have. Whether it is for all four or just one of them. Thanks for looking.

 The FN FS2000 is a semi-auto only carbine based on the proven FN F2000 bullpup design with a 17.4"" civilian-legal barrel. The FS2000 offers the user a compact, reliable and accurate firearm suitable for security, personal defense, or competition. The gas-operated system utilizes a rotating bolt lock-up and fires a wide variety of 5.56x45mm ammunition fed from readily available standard M16-style magazines. Visual verification of the chamber condition is easily performed via a hinged access port at the rear of the receiver. Fired cases are ejected through a forward port away from the operator. The FS2000 sports adjustable iron sights and a top-mounted M1913 rail for mounting optical, electronic or laser sighting systems. An angled-face muzzle brake helps minimize recoil. The broad, well-formed buttplate and short length of pull comfortably fit most shooters.

Several examples of the extra engineering Liberty puts into their safes are 30 minutes of fire protection, UL Listed security, S&G UL lock and relocker devices to deter forced entry or drilling.
Liberty's Centurion 20 is solid safe that is made offshore using Liberty's engineering and specifications. In order to achieve minimal fireprotection, Liberty ads an extra layer of fireboard in the ceiling and door to achieve 30 minutes of fire protection or 62,000 BTUs; but REMEMBER if you live more than 10 minutes from a fire department, we suggest you consider a higher fire rated safe. The CN20 is made in China. Centurion Deluxe models (CN20-DLX, CN23-DLX and CN30-DLX are made in the USA). All UL rated Centurion Safes come with Liberty's Lifetime warranty.

This optic has only been subject to 20 or so rounds on a 12 pound .223 rifle, it is in mint condition and for the money cannot be beat in my opinion, only used to sight in a barrel swap on a target rifle, I no longer own that rifle and have no further use for this setup, if I had a rifle to put this on I would not sell it!!! will consider trades for pistol, revolver, rifle, anything cool I probably wont use!

521,http://www.armslist.com/posts/386521,For Sale/Trade:  WTT road bike for tactical rifle/cash/accessories/whatever,"Downtown, Lafayette, Indiana",$ 900,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 1, 2012",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I've got a beautifully maintained 2008 Specialized Allez Elite Compact 56cm that has seen only light use and less than normal wear. It has only been stored indoors and I've kind of babied it, so it's in excellent condition. The real bonus is that it has a full Ultegra 105 upgrade (shifters, derailleurs, etc). 

Ideally, I'd like to trade this for a tactical rifle (such as a Mossberg, Ruger 10/22, GSG AK-47, H&K MP5, etc) with the remainder being made up in cash.  

Now, I hate haggling, so this comes pre-haggled. Here's how I calculated the trade value: I took it to my local Specialized dealer and asked them how much I should ask. They said I should ask $1400 and take nothing less than $1000. So, I'm asking $900. 

I'm pretty flexible so feel free to get creative.  I'm very willing to consider matching trade value with accessories, ammo, cases or even another firearm (perhaps a solid pistol or shotgun).  I like the idea of trading because I think that both people have the best chance to get the most value -- It's important to me that everyone involved feels like they've gotten a good deal.

Bottom line, if I've got the bike you want and you've got a rifle I want, then shoot me an e-mail and we'll figure it out (And if you just want to buy it outright, that's cool too.)

It was sent to Scattergun Technologies a division of Wilson Combat, to be worked over.  Rails and action smoothed out for smoother, faster cycling.  Upgraded Hi-Viz follower and spring and their signature trac-lok sighting system.  Blade instead of bead up front with a tritium dot and an adjustable Ghost ring rear for quicker target acquisition.   

Stock is the Blackhawk Specops NRS pistol Recoil reduction stock.  It has springs in it to eat up some of the felt recoil.  The stock also has a 4 way position setting just like an AR.  It’ll adjust to a wide range of shooters and is nice when you’re wearing body armor and/or a winter jacket.  Front pump handle is a Surefire M500 lighting system.  Barrel has an added heat shroud for better cooling and it has a six shot side saddle shell carrier.  I upgraded the button head cap bolts from standard black to stainless to avoid the possibility of rust on a standard bolt.  They match better also.  

I added the side sling mount on this gun.  Lets the sling come off the side rather than underneath.  This prevents the gun from wanting to roll over when you sling it up.  Both were upgraded to nickel to match the rest of the gun.  Here are some of the bigger prices invested.  

Basic gun about $450.00

Scattergun work:  400.00

M500 light:  225.00

Stock: 65.00

After messing with it and messing with it, the stock just doesn't fit her.    

This gun has had 75 shots through it at Ozark's Shooting Complex down toward Branson.  After people who know alot more than I do helped her, it's just not worth sinking a ton of money into another stock or having this one altered.  We're stepping up to a Beretta RL with adjustable stock.    

I still have the receipt for this gun, and actually have the skeet receipts as well.  I didn't post a photo because it's a brand new gun exactly like any photo you can find online.  I had a Bass Pro gift card, so I have $450 in the gun, which I'll take.  As you can imagine, since I gave $570 for it 21 days ago, I'm not inclined to go lower than $450.    Phone REDACTED

Original owner and would be surprised if it’s had 250 rounds through it.  One of the many impulse buys I had while working at Gander Mountain that simply sat in my safe.  This model features the six position telescoping stock and removable top handle.

This gun has been upgraded with a two piece Surefire Rail and ARMS #38 Swan Sleeve w/flip up rear sight.  This riser not only looks better than having the top handle installed but enables you to add a see thru weapon sight without the front sight obstructing your reticle.  The grip is upgraded as well.

The original top carry handle is included along with original paperwork and three 30rnd mags + original hand guards.

The Surefire rail and ARMS riser retail together for almost $350.  No marks/scratches or signs of wear and includes quality upgrades.  As I mentioned, maybe 250 rounds shot.  It’s only been out of my safe on three occasions.

This is a tacticooled SKS. It may not please the purists. It is done nicely, not hacked. Tapco stock with bottom rail in olive drab. Choate reciever mounted scope mount. Tapco gas tube with rail. Tapco piston. Meets all 922 legal regulations for imported semi auto rifle. Will come with 3 detachable polymer magazines. 1 30 round, 2 20 round. Bore, receiver, bolt, and bolt carrier are all in extremely good shape. This rifle is cleaned after every use and is in great shape. Cycles everything thrown through it. Extremely heavy duty gun, very stout. This gun will last a long time, and I imagine the value will also rise over the years for SKS's.

Asking $800 for everything.

This is a great alternative for someone that wants the quality of an Arsenal due to the very desirable barrel and for how well the rifle was put together. The rifle is very accurate and like all other AK's it is very reliable and fun to shoot.

Has a East German Weiger Hammer Forged Military Barrel and premium all matching # part sets (Bulgarian parts [excluding the wood I believe]), and side rail to install optics. Extras included are:
1 Bakelite magazine
1 Bakelite bayonet
1 Tantal mag
1 Tapco mag that came with the rifle.
1 Magpul ACS Stock
1 Magpul AFG2 grip 
All of this is stored in a (cheap) rifle case and also included are 300 rounds of surplus ammo, 90 rounds silver bear, and can opener.

This rifle was custom built for a company that no longer sells them. It has had about 900 rounds of surplus ammo through it. Still is very clean and no corrosion on anything except in the removable non-chrome-lined muzzle break. The Barrel and Bore are still like new shape with no wear... still very shiny."

USA.  A custom bull barrel chambered in the long range versatile .257 Roberts caliber was used (the 7x57 case necked down to 25 caliber).  26"" tapered barrel, Weaver mounts with vintage period correct original VistaScope 3-9x40 scope.  Pachmayr whiteline recoil pad with Monte Carlo benchrest profile stock (flat bottom for rest).  This is a heavy gun over 9 lbs. but will shoot in the same hole sub-moa all day long.  Classic controlled feed Mauser action with German proofs on floor plate and trigger guard.  Flaig's built them on Oberndorf and FN actions, this looks like a German Oberndorf but has no markings, it is a military action with thumb notch.  The barrel says ""Flaig Ace"".   Receiver ring and bridge are d/t for scope mounts.  Factory bolt mounted safety was removed, and it has an aftermarket side tang safety on right side.  SAKO FINLAND adjustable trigger 2 lbs.  Safety and trigger are very smooth. Barrel bore inside is mirror bright and like new, this rifle was obviously used light and well taken care of. This gun belonged to a local gunsmith who used it to shoot bench rest competition, and also for an occasional whitetail deer or antelope hunt.  Condition is 95% + to the day it was built.  Do a GOOGLE SEARCH on Flaig's barrels and rifles, they were the best in the business until 1968 when they closed up shop.  The saying was you could not get past the gate at Flaig's unless you were driving a Cadillac.  Will sell FTF to other Pa. residents with valid picture i.d. drivers license, or ship to your FFL.  This is a relatively heavy gun over 9 lbs. so shipping is $40 on East Coast, or $60 on West Coast.   Alaska or Hawaii shipping is $100.  Sorry but that's what it costs via UPS or Fedex now.  Shipping inside state of Pa. may  be less and I'd refund any shipping overcharge.  SEE BELOW INFORMATION ON FLAIG'S FOUND ON THE NET.=====================see this link http://forums.gunbroker.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=236847 There was a company named ""Flaig's of Millvale"" from Millvale, Pennsylvania. They imported mid to high quality European rifles under their own name. They may have varied the name to just ""Flaig"". They were the big Kahoona when I was growing up in the Pittsburgh area. Most were built on either an FN (Herstel, Belguim) action or an Oberndorf action. They also did gunsmithing and restoration on customer provided actions including the woodwork, checkering and engraving. Generally considered high quality products with an excellant reputation. Like Herter's in Wisconsin, a lot of their business was mail order.===============It is a FlaigAce which was a company in Pittsburg PA. They took FN and Oberdorf actions, strengthened the actions, re-barreled them with their barrels and sold them to the public. They would take your action and do it the same way if you contacted them. They went out of business in 1968 after the Gun Control Act of 1968. Once they got done with the action, it would handle any barrel including magnum barrels, depending on what barrel they were putting on the action. The most popular according to a site we found on line was the 243 but they did 220 swift, 222, some magnum calibers, and a few others but for some reason the 243 was the caliber they did the most. I am finding several things about them in a Google search as to where they did a LOT of mail order work for customers and sold many different calibers, types, and styles of guns. One link stated that the rifles begin at around $500 in price now and go up to around $1500 for some of the rarer calibers.================In Millvale Pa.....used to be a fairly good size outfit.....they would buy products from others and put their name on it....stocks were for the most part Fajen with a Flaig's butt plate. You could order higher grade wood but it was still Fajen, the barrels were done by G.R. Douglas, with a few reworked Springfield tubes thrown in from time to time, I stoped by their shop in Millvale a few times.....was a neat place, another stop for me was at Paul Jaeger's place in Jenkinstown.===============Everything I am finding about these rifles is good, even on the 93 actions. Apparently Flaig Ace strengthened the actions when they rebarreled them in higher pressure calibers. Saw several for sale and have sold at various sites with all commanding decent prices. $500 has been the lowest and a 264 Winchester Magnum went for $1200 on one auction site. I shot this one, took it to haver the head space checked today and the gunsmith knew a good bit about them. He said the head space was great. He liked it. He has some customers he is telling about it.===================Flaig's was located in Millvale, PA, if my memory serves me well. In the early '60's my dad sent my 6.5 Arisaka to them and it came home with a Flaig's Ace barrel in .257 Roberts, a nicely crafted, scope compatible bolt handle, and an incredible polish and blue job that has held up amazingly to this day. Not sure when they closed doors, but it was a sad day. Don't believe they relocated. Beautiful rifle you've got there, and a super caliber.========================Flaig's was a great place did custom work and also had a gun shop in a large log cabin setting on top of a hill in the city. They would let you go through the stock blank area and pick out what you wanted. I got a number of AAA blanks 20 years ago and one day am going to use them. They don't have the same name as G&H or other high end shops but some of their work was very good. You could also take them a stock broken or cracked like a old LC Smith and they could turn out a replacement using the stock blank of your choice, semi-finished or ready to shoot. Hey this old Va. Country Boy won't driving No Cadalax. Take it from an olde timer. Flaig's was one of the best in the business. Something that's hard to duplicate today.=====================Just another detail or two. Found one of their ads in the May 1959 Rifleman. Full page, ""GUNS AND GUN PARTS, GUN STOCKS AND BLANKS, SCOPES, AMMUNITION, GUNSMITHING SERVICE"" ""SAKO ACTIONS on 26"" 4 1/2 # med. heavy DOUGLAS chrome moly barrel, white ""Flaig-Ace"" barrels ""made by internationally known barrel maker whose barrels have made records in matches at home and abroad"". They advertise both the Douglas and the Ace.======================I grew up 2 minutes from Flaig's. Flaig's was on Evergreen Road where it meets Babcock Boulevard. They had a Millvale address but were actually in Ross township, right next to Pat McBrides restaurant. Great for personal, professional gunsmithing. A bit on the pricey side but anything good usually is. My dad used to say the gatekeeper would not let you in unless you were driving a Cadillac. Had to really go back in the memory banks for that bit of useless info, but a trip down memory lane is good for the soul."
