Miller of Syracuse was the first to patent a multi shot cylinder, in about 1840, long before Samuel Colt used the cylinder in his guns.  Billinghurst was his gunsmith.

The 40 caliber single shot plains rifle, is a J.J. Miller, approximate 1843.  When you hold the guns side by side, you can tell they are made by the same gunsmith.

I have done extensive testing with the 307 GNR and it performs flawlessly. The 284 GNR works fine, but some of the shorter lighter weight 7mm bullets are hard to find these days so only preliminary testing has been done on it. As more and more 7mm bullets become available I will be doing more testing on it. The 307 GNR will be a bit more power than the 300 GNR plus you don't have to do the cutting, trimming and such that is required on the 300 GNR. The downside is that a Ruger stretch frame revolver is required for the conversion. The good thing is that the Ruger 357 Maximum revolvers are easier to get and cheaper than in recent past"

This is NOT an M&P15 Sport. This weapon is in excellent condition and has seen only 320 rounds, all of it was brass cased Lake City XM193 and the weapon performed flawlessly (no failures to feed, fire, or eject). 

I have added the following parts:
1. Magpul MOE handguard and RVG vertical foregrip
2. Knights Armament (KAC) USMC 200-600m Micro Flip rear sight

-	Marine Corps issue single point sling
-	Uncle Mike’s Tactical Rifle Assault Case, 36” 
-	Factory hardcase, handguard, owner’s manual

I have just over $2,200 into this setup, so that is my price. I will only separate the magazines and ammunition if you buy the rifle and do not want them, so please do not ask if I will sell them to you without the rifle; the answer is “no”. 

All laws apply to this transaction. If you do not have a valid CCH and NCDL then I will require that we meet at my local gun shop for an FFL transfer, the fee to be paid by buyer. I will also require a bill of sale signed by both of us. Yes, I know the law does not require all of this, but I want to be sure you can legally own a firearm; there will be no exceptions.

I will ONLY consider the following partial trades and they must be in excellent condition:

- SDM  20” fluted stainless steel barrel with a rifle length gas system, 1:8 twist, and chambered in .223 Wylde or 5.56 Nato Match. This must be verifiably from a quality barrel manufacturer and come with a headspaced bolt.

Armitage International Scarab Skorpion 9MM Semi-Automatic. Comes in original box, one 12 round magazine and a 30 round magazine. Has had very few rounds put through it. Does not like target ammo. The loads are too light and lack enough energy to force bolt back and eject. Something like Tul ammo has worked fine for me and will even throw in a box of 50 Tul 9mm. Also comes with a threaded barrel for attachments.

I bought this gun from a dealership when I lived in Florida for $630 and is completely legal.

I would prefer something in 40 caliber but the smaller rounds will do as well as long as you can provide a bit of ammunition with the sale. This is not my primary ccw, it is simply something that I can wear when added concealment is necessary so I'm not looking for anything which is going to break my wallet. Two rules to keep in mind...first, please don't attempt to price gouge me on a weapon which isn't even on the banners immediate radar... Second, I prefer something used and I certainly won't pay full price for a used weapon. Face to face sale with Oregon residents only please.

Firearm makes that come into mind are Taurus, beretta, ruger, kel-tec and kahr. Please don't hesitate to send me an offer as long as you follow my two rules- other than that surprise me and show me what you have! Thanks for reading my long winded post.

Ps. As a side note, If you have something brand new or something very nice and you are interested I can offer to trade a Glock 23 with night sights and two 13 round magazines. Pics are available for those who request them."

You will no longer have to worry about moisture causing rust on your firearm parts. It is also very resistant to wear, which is extremely important when working with parts that are constantly in motion. Lastly, Nickel Boron plating is self lubricating. You no longer have to worry about adding excessive amounts of oil which collects carbon residue and debris which can cause your firearm to malfunction. This cuts down on maintenance and cleaning requirements.

---------------------------------

For your consideration is a full auto AR-15 Bolt Carrier Group that has been plated in Nickle Boron.  This is a new BCG that has never been installed in an upper reciever.

I have around a 100 rounds through this rifle on the range. I bought it for a elk hunt last year that I had to cancel. It is too much rifle for my local deer hunting. The laminate stock and stainless barrel/receiver make this a good looking rifle! The most important feature is an effective muzzle break that tames this mule down to the recoil of my 30-06. It also has a recoil butt pad from Limbsaver that further helps absorb the recoil. With the weight of the rifle, the brake and the recoil pad it shoots much more comfortably than a 'naked' 338 Win Mag. The bore is clean and the action is very smooth. The rifle has a built in scope base. Ruger Stainless Rings are included. The finish is stainless. Will accept Pay Pal. If you send a personal check plan on waiting until it clears my bank. Price includes cost of shipping via UPS or FEDEX. Plan of sending me via email or fax your FFL contact info and signed copy of the FFL. I will ship to FFL only of course.

This DPMS AR-15 has been a safe queen and only taken to the field once. It's in perfect condition with all factory parts except the addition of the Simmons scope. It comes with 1 30 round mag. If you'd like to make a cash offer that's fine, however I'm looking for a trade for an AK. So if your cash doesn't equal what good AK's are going for then don't bother. Cash can be added to either side to even up a trade. (Take note that most AK's are selling for a lot less than AR's)

The GSG 5 is an identical replication of the MP 5, except one great thing: Its a 22 cal. Because of the low cost of ammunition the GSG 5 makes a perfect plinking rifle, training rifle or a serious varmint hunting rifle. Nothing of its kind has ever been introduced in the United States. The user will be impressed with its weight and performance. If you are a varmint hunter you will be encouraged by all the options the GSG-5 has to offer with its railing system, faux suppressor and easy change magazine. For training purposes, the GSG-5 is a low cost alternative for Law Enforcement agencies.

There is a lot of stuff here that I collected when I was younger. Total value new was around $920. I am not one of those people who thing that you get what you paid for your things new that is stupid its used it has depreciated I understand that. Though I do feel that everything here is worth $200 in cash. May be a little negotiable but id rather give it to my younger brothers and cousins than take much less than that. One of the tanks is full so you can do a function check on the guns. I will sell any part individually although would rather sell it all at once. If you want a particular piece then shoot me a message with what you want and your offer. Thanks for looking.

959,http://www.armslist.com/posts/851959,For Sale:  Colt LE-6940 AR15 RESTRICTED Rollmark - AR-15 NIB,"South Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina","$ 2,999","Listed On: Monday, January 14, 2013",Rifles,Colt                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Colt is commonly regarded as producing the best AR-15s and the LE 6940 is their top of the line model. It uses a monolithic upper which is machined from a large single aluminum block instead of most AR15s which have extruded rails bolted on.

The advantages are: Improved accuracy - the rails don't contact the barrel throwing off accuracy. Also because the rail is continuous, you don't have to use cantilevered mounts when mounting long scopes, making for a more rigid optics platform. Also when mounting lasers, they stay truer to the bore axis. A more rigid platform with fewer parts to break, work loose, or lose. 

In addition to being the top of the line commercially made AR15, this is the most desirable LE6940 in terms of collectibility. Colt introduced the LE6940 with the ""RESTRICTED MILITARY / GOVERNMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT / EXPORT USE ONLY"" rollmark on the right side. It was of course perfectly legal for consumers to own but was marked the same as their military M4s. Then they changed to the ""Sporter"" SP6940s without the rollmarks, which caused an uproar among collectors who hated the ""Sporter"" markings. In response Colt then changed the designation back to LE6940 but the ""RESTRICTED..."" rollmark was never brought back. This is a rare LE6940 with the ""RESTRICTED"" rollmark and it is 100% NEW IN BOX. It has never been fired or even had a magazine inserted into it. 

This is as pristine of an original LE6940 as you will find. Comes COMPLETE with all original accessories including: Flip up rear and front sights Original box Instructions Bag which contained: Two 20rd mags (that's how colt shipped them). Original plastic bag for the rifle. Must be legal to purchase"
