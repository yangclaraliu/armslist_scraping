I just Cleaned the Carburetor, put a New Battery in it, and Sharpened the Blade so it's ready to go! Starts right up and mows very well.

All the safety interlocks are in place and it's not a real fast mower, so it's great to get your kids out there and mow your lawn for you.

I don't have the manuals for it, but it's pretty simple to operate and I can go over it with you on delivery.

I live on the Naval Weapons Station in Yorktown. You can pick it up there, or I'll deliver it locally for asking price.

I have never even broken the seal on the box. Ask $650 for a scope the retail at $890. This is a great deal! Specs are below.

Built for reliability and optical precision, the Elite Tactical 3-12x44 Mil-Dot Riflescope from Bushnell features an illuminated Mil-Dot reticle positioned in the first focal plane. When the reticle is located in the first focal plane, the size of the reticle increases or decreases relative to the change in the scope's power, just as the target does. Elite Tactical scopes offer remarkably bright optics with excellent coatings. The lenses are fully multicoated and optimized to deliver outstanding light transmission. The exterior lens surfaces are treated with RainGuard HD - a water repellent coating that minimizes light-scatter from water drops, mist, fog, etc.

This Elite Tactical sports a 1 inch main-tube that's purged with argon gas for all-weather reliability. That means optical clarity in any weather condition or situation.

The construction of the Elite Tactical features classic clean styling with a ""Blacked-Out"" cosmetic matte finish. This optic not only looks good - it's also designed and built to endure the punishment of rigorous field use. In practical use - the Elite Tactical lives up to its name. Every spec and feature comes into play to deliver a bright, clear, and well detailed sight picture. Additionally - there's a side focus knob for eliminating parallax error, and 0.1 Mil windage and elevation clicks that work well with the illuminated Mil-Dot system.

Optics
Fully multi-coated lenses for enhanced clarity and light transmission
RainGuard HD water-repellent lens coating causes moisture from rain, snow, sleet, and condensation to bead up and scatter less light
Ultra wide band anti-reflection coating to boost brightness at dawn and dusk

I bought the factory replacements direct from Havlin Sales and the receiver was drilled and tapped during assembly. The firing pin was good when I got the rifle but I like to go new on old components. Never know when they won't be available anymore. According to Havlin, this was probably a custom build. Often times a worker would build their own rifle. I mention this because this particular rifle has a barrel 1.25"" longer than factory specs and the stock is much nicer than normal. When I was ordering the parts, I mentioned this to Havlin and that's where I got that information from. Anyway, it's stunning. The stock is amazing and it shoots really tight groups using stock ammo. The peep sights are likewise accurate. These models are valued at $350++ depending on condition. Add in the extras and my price is fair. My firearms are clean, functioning and ready for the range. If you've been looking for a Mossberg 44US, you won't find a nicer one at this price. I've taken 16 pictures and will email additional pictures to those interested.

It is not a Hi Power, but it looks like one.  This FEG P9RK double-action semi-automatic pistol comes with an extra 14 round magazine, excellent factory walnut grips, and a secure carrying case, all for $350.  It would make a perfect duty pistol, or a protective house gun.

Here is a little history on the P9RK pistol:

The FEG P9RK is the short-barrel version of the P9R pistol. Both guns are made in Hungary by the FEGARMY Arms factory. The P9RK uses the modified P9 frame and action, with a Smith & Wesson double-action trigger system. 

The P9RK is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. The barrel is operated using a Browning cam system, and is locked to the slide by three locking lugs on the top of the barrel, which fit into mated recesses on the inside of the slide, just ahead of the ejection port. Frame and slide are made from carbon steel and have a blued finish. The Double Action trigger system with external hammer has a slide-mounted safety lever, which also works as a de-cocker when safety is engaged.

It has a bull barrel, new 15 round magazine($40), new firing pin($18), new sling($22), new sling swivels($38), new scope mount($23), rings and a new Burris Timberline 3x9 scope($200). I bought the factory replacements direct from Havlin Sales and the receiver was drilled and tapped during assembly. The firing pin was good when I got the rifle but I like to go new on old components. Never know when they won't be available anymore. According to Havlin, this was probably a custom build. Often times a worker would build their own rifle. I mention this because this particular rifle has a barrel 1.25"" longer than factory specs and the stock is much nicer than normal. When I was ordering the parts, I mentioned this to Havlin and that's where I got that information from. Anyway, it's stunning. The stock is amazing and it shoots really tight groups using stock ammo. The peep sights are likewise accurate. These models are valued at $350++ depending on condition. Add in the extras and my price is fair. My firearms are clean, functioning and ready for the range. If you've been looking for a Mossberg 44US, you won't find a nicer one at this price. I've taken 16 pictures and will email additional pictures to those interested. Looking to trade as opposed to selling out right. Thanks for looking!

The Winchester Model 1894 was the first commercial repeating rifle built to be used with smokeless powder. The 1894 was originally chambered to fire 2 metallic black powder cartridges, the .32-40 Winchester and .38-55 Winchester. In 1895 Winchester went to a different steel composition for rifle manufacturing that could handle higher pressure rounds and offered the rifle in .25-35 Winchester and .30-30 Winchester. The .30-30 Winchester, or .30WCF (Winchester Centerfire), is the cartridge that has become synonymous with the Model 1894.[2]"

It was the first successful semi-automatic shotgun designed and remained in production until 1998. The name of the shotgun designates that it is an autoloader with a capacity of five shots, four in the magazine and one in the chamber. (light use, normal wear)

The Browning Auto-5 is a long-recoil operated semi-automatic shotgun. Shells are stored in a tubular magazine under the barrel. When a chambered shell is fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together (for a distance greater than the shell length) and recock the hammer. As the barrel returns forward to its initial position the bolt remains behind and thus the spent shell is ejected. Then the bolt returns forward and feeds another shell from the magazine into the action. This type of long recoil action was the first of its kind and patented in 1900 by John Browning.

To load the weapon, shells are fed into the bottom of the action, where they are pushed into the tubular magazine. Most A-5s have removable plugs in the magazine which prevent more than 3 shells from being loaded (two in the magazine, plus one in the chamber) to comply with U.S. Federal migratory waterfowl laws, as well as some state hunting regulations. With the plug removed, the total capacity is 5 rounds. If the chamber is open (the operating handle is drawn back) the first shell loaded into the magazine tube will go directly into the chamber. The bolt then closes, and all further shells fed into the gun go into the magazine."

second is a bsa 3-9x40 DeerHunter.  all adjustment points are checkered for easy adjustment with or with out gloves.  turrets are 1/4"" aat 100yds, and alum. caps as well.  comes with rings and covers.  turrets are zero adjustable via allen set screws.  meaning that you can zero the optic to 100yds then set your turret back to zero with out changing the setting of your crosshairs.  the reticle is a ""fine duplex""  with a center ""bullseyes"" dot and a bullet drop compensator.  

the gamo was originally installed on a .22 rifle but never really used and found the rifle more fun with out it.  i think a total of maybe 100rds werre shot through the gun with the optic mounted.  since then it has just been takng up room in the safe.  

the bsa has never been mounted on anything.  i baught this as a replacement scope for a rifle but then ended up recieving a different scope from my wife as a gift.  it is brand new.  

i paid a totalof $250 for both scopes and spent about another $60 on rings and covers for them.  looking to make a straight trade.  make me an offer"

LNIB Springfield XDM 45 (black slide on black frame).
Comes with original box, papers, cleaning brush, spent cartridge test (DEC 2010).
Also comes with all XDM gear (gun holster, mag holster, 3 interchangeable backstraps, 2 - 13 round mags).

I bought it new from Academy for $679.99 + tax which was a HUGE mistake because they overprice their guns.
$679.99 + 9.25% tax = $742.88 out the door. I went and looked at all the gunstores in Fort Smith for this XDM 45.
The only place that had it was Academy so I took the leap. 

I have only fired 100 rounds through this gun. Detailed stripped, cleaned, and is sitting in my safe.

I want to trade for a Springfield XDM 9 (4.5 inch barrel) or possibly a Springfield XDM 9 (5.25 inch barrel).
It's cheaper to shoot 9mm versus .45 ACP all day long. 

I will consider selling the XDM 45 for $640 cash - FIRM. That's $100 off full retail & tax from Academy.

The average retail cost on these XDM 45s are $599 + tax = $655.39. So my price of $640 is fair considering I've only fired 100 rounds. 

I am in Fort Smith and can meet in Fort Smith, Barling, Van Buren, Alma, Greenwood, Lavaca, Central City, basically within 25 miles of the Fort Smith radius. Bill of sale will be provided and conceal carry license will be presented upon meet and greet."

Chambered for 25 WSSM, this AR-15 is designed for accurate mid-long range hunting.  Take deer up to 500-600 yards with ease.  Take coyotes out to 700-800 yards.  The 25 WSSM has the same ballistics as a 25-06.  That power in an AR-15 is an amazing combination.  The Olympic Arms 25 WSSM upper is on a DPMS lower with an A2 stock.  The upper alone costs $850, so $900 is a steal for this rifle.  There has been around 170 rounds shot through this upper.  It has a 24"" bull barrel with a nice target crown.  Extremely accurate, I have got sub-moa groups at 100 yards with just regular factory ammunition.  I will throw in 20 rounds of Winchester Ballistic Tips.

    Made by MSA, which is known for making the highest quality masks on the market, and that currently supplies most of our US military branches. These models were supplied to the US Forces around the globe. No longer in production, these masks are highly desired for their strong and tight grip as well as their super-slim lines. Unlike the MSA Advantage 1000, these masks use a NATO 40mm filter and have a microphone pickup (without mic), a ballistic polycarbonate outer lens, and a drinking straw attachment. Six-point adjustable harness zip-pulls snug and quick releases. Also features an effective voice emitter for eased communication. Will accept any 40mm NATO threaded filter.

Glock 30 .45 ACP, Gen 3.

I bought this Glock new in 2006. It for certain has less than 500 rounds through it with 100% reliability as you'd expect. I have turned over a new leaf and the ""never sell a gun"" mentality has changed to ""sell/trade guns you don't shoot for something you will."" Great pistol, great carry gun.

I keep my guns in meticulous condition, you won't be disappointed with this one. You can tell from the pics this is a low round count gun. Gun is about as close to new as a fired gun can be, inside and out. Comes with (2) 10 round magazines and everything you get with a new Glock, box paperwork, etc.

$450 firm FTF to MO residents. Not looking for trades at this time. I can meet in Columbia during the week or between there and the Hannibal area on the weekends.

The rifle has had about 9 or 10 rounds shot through it. The rifle was purchased on sept. 8,1980. It was handed down to me by my father when he passed away back in 2006. It still has the blue-ing on it from the factory. It has a 3 lb. trigger and the bolt-action is still really smooth. It has been kept in a humidity controlled gun cabinet for the last 22 years and only been taken out in 1981 to go sight it in (8-9 rounds) and 1 round for the buck that he killed and mounted, then he fell out of the sport of hunting and started fishing. It  has a bright polish to the gun and the scope (not sure if that is how they used to do it back in the 80's or what). The pictures do not do it justification. If you would like to come take a look at it or set up an appointment to meet with me and look at the rifle, then give me a call at REDACTED. I hate to give it up, but it is too old for my style.

I have looked it up, and this rifle at (mark's outdoors), just for the rifle itself is $599.99 (Plus Tax) and that's not including the scope bases ($40), scope mounts ($34), and the leupold scope ($450). so the retail of the gun is $1,200, but i'm selling it for cheap cause i need a nice shotgun for duck season or another 30-06 in a newer year.
