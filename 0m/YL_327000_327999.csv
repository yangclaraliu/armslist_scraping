I haven't yet purchased a firearm because I'm the stereotypical poor college student living off Top Ramen, and my old truck guzzles a lot of gas. I would like to offer my technological services and expertise in exchange for partial or full payment on your gently used conceal carry weapon. I have my eye on the Glock 27, but I am open to anything 9mm and up. 

So, what services and expertise do I have to offer? Well my qualifications include working for the past 3 years as software developer for a local college software shop. I have also worked for The Association of Former Students as a web developer on http://www.aggienetwork.com/

I can develop static and dynamic content websites in html5 and javascript, or Microsoft Asp.Net. 

Additionally, I can develop stand alone custom desktop applications (windows, mac, linux) of any scale in countless languages (c, c++, java, python, haskell, lisp, and on and on)

Data recovery. I can recover lost data on your crashed, broken, crapped out, or dead laptops, hard drives, and usb drives.

I can fully remove viruses, spyware, and all other malware, and provide proper security tools to keep your computer safe in the future (if you're using macafee/norton your computer is VERY insecure). When there is no hope of getting rid of the slew of viruses already in your system, I can always back up your data and...

Wipe hard drive clean (reformat), then re-install windows fresh.

While we're on the topic of data and security, I can set up all of your automatic backup needs, from onsite hard drives to off site storage like the cloud. If you have no idea what I'm talking about and you do not back up your data, then you desperately need to. 

I also upgrade computer hardware in laptops and desktops (RAM, hard drive space, DVD/Blue-ray, etc.).

Hardware Issues: I am no stranger to a soldering iron and can fix many hardware issues on varied electronic devices (issues with laptop power cable/connector, broken screens, jammed ports, anything is worth looking at) 

I can set up WiFi, home networks, home theaters, car audio, get that damn remote working, or just teach you how any or all of it works. 

I'm very skilled and have lots of experience with all things technological, so the only limit is your imagination.  Please let me know if interested. 

Thanks and Gig 'Em"

Absolutely beautify high polished CZ 75B 9mm stainless steel pistol-this gun is completely flawless both in function and appearance.  Comes with factory cocobolo wood grips.  Designed in 1975, all steel construction (except alloy framed compacts), hammer forged barrel, double-single action and ambidextrous safety.  The CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world--its service record is long established.  

I bought this pistol new from Cabela's just last year.  I've put maybe 300 rounds through it-it works perfectly.  Strictly a range for me, it has spent its life in my safe.  This is easily the most handsome stainless gun I own, pictures don't do it justice.

This is the most beautiful Walnut stock I have ever seen on one of these little Marlins.

Marlin only made this gun a few years (1966-1978) as I understand. It was styled to resemble the US Army M1 carbine, with eighteen inch barrel, handguard, barrel band, nine shot magazine even with the end of the stock! This was prior to making the cheaper and widely popular model 60. This features a walnut stock VS the newer birch stock. It also has a brass feed tube instead of the steel one found on the model 60. 

This is a fun shooter and a cool piece of history!

I will only sell to a person legal to own this firearm. Must be of legal age and a Missouri resident. I will also provide a bill of sale showing I am the legal owner and it is not stolen. I will show you my ID, and ask you do the same.

Can not travel very far at the moment so you will probably have to come to me, but we will see how it goes. I am doing this from my phone, so if you want pics I can text or email them. So here we go:

Savage 116 .300WM. Solid stainless. Comes in a soft case. Has a Nikon Prostaff 3-9x40 mil-dot scope. $500

Smith Corona by Savage sporterized 22-250. Beautiful stock, heavy heavy bull barel, custom trigger job done on it too. Will need to be drilled and tapped for a scope. Beautiful gun, but would be too hard to explain here so feel free to call me on this one. Only asking $250 for this.

Savage .17HMR. Solid stainless, bull barel, with Sweet 17 2-7x32 scope. Has drop adjustment but no windage dial. Grey wood laminate stock. Immaculate rifle. Very heavy. $250

Binelli Nova 12g Shotgun. This is a long barel, not a short ""home defense"" style shotgun. Shoots 2 3/4, 3, and 3 1/2 shells. All black, pump. Have 2 chokes, and the choke removal tool. Another beauty! $350

I don't want to sell any of these. I am asking less than I laid for all of them by far. If you want to lowball me don't waste my time. I feel my prices are fair. And I'm pretty firm. Might consider a bone stock AR-15 for the 300WM. But need cash. Like I said, email me for pictures. Thanks for looking!"

I am looking to trade for a compact .45 or a pocket .357/.38 revolver. If your gun is worth more i would be willing to pay cash on top. I also have a Ruger P90 I would be willing to trade as well."

Rifle has a Tapco foregrip and a PKM styled stock (about a $70.00 value).

If any trades are to be made, I'm interested in Glocks, and 1911s, but I would need cash added on either of those unless you are including some extras or if the 1911 is a higher end model. I will not let this go for $500, you are crazy if you think it's worse any less than $575.00 with all that is on this as well as the rifle itself. Be aware, the rifle was meant to be duracoated so there is no finish on the receiver. Easy fix since I have the paint kit. If you'd like that included in the sale, add $40.00 to the price, I paid $55.37 for the kit.

24” Heavy Barrel
Serial Number Dates to 1979 Manufacture

Canjar Trigger Set, 77-1
Bore and Action Excellent
The recoil lug and the first inch of barrel are bedded. This stabalizes the metal in the stock and usually assures there is no movement of the barreled action in the wood. That slight movement is usually the reason for degraded accuracy. 
Barrel is Free Floated
Includes Picatinney Scope mount and rings
Also included are Hard case, Cheek Pad, Sling and 60rds 308 ammo

The Canjar trigger set is adjustable and considered one of the best out there. Not a “production” trigger set but these were “hand made” in Denver and had 6+ months wait and $200+, when they were being made. Gentleman has since passed on and now are next to impossible to find.

Stock was a little rough when I got it so I smoothed it up, bedded and free floated the barrel. And the fit is very nice.

I intended on using it as a shooter but have a couple other things I “need” more, so I’m letting it go.

I've been carrying this little gem for about a year now. It has been a absolute delight to carry and has gone bang every time I've pulled the trigger. I've just recently decided to go with something with a little more capacity. The handgun is in great fully functional condition. KelTec will warranty this for the life of the firearm, so if the are ever any issues with it, just give the company the call and they will either send you the parts or have you send it in for service. The extractor, extractor screw and extractor spring have been replaced and the second magazine (which has the +1 extension) is currently at keltec having the magazine spring replaced an will be included with the pistol.

Also included are a IWB holster, gun lock w/ key, pocket clip for holsterless carry

I have 3 of my deer hunting trail cams for sale. There are nothing wrong with any of these and all have actually been used within the last 2 months and work great. The only reason I'm selling these are because I have multiples of all of them and am trying to get rid of a few of my multiples so I can hopefully pick up a few of the new Plotwatcher Pro cams to add to my scouting arsenal. The first 2 up for sale are Cuddeback Captures. These are simply the best cameras I have used to date. The trigger speed on Cuddebacks are faster than any other and it really shows, more deer in the center of the shot and less missed. They are both still in great condition and last re8ally long on batteries even set at the shortest 30 second intervals. Both still have the mounting straps which work quite well because they can be tightened to almost any size tree. These cost me $230 plus tax a piece new, I'm looking to get $150 each for these. The last camera currently up for sale is a Moultrie D55. This is another great camera that have multiples of in my arsenal, this is probably the best camera under $175 you can buy. These work great on 3 shot burst and also post all temps and moon phases and also has mounting strap as well. This is is also in great condition and has recently been used. This one cost me $125 plus tax new. I'm looking to get $75 out of it. If you buy any of these for the asking price I will throw in a 2gb SD card which is all the memory you'll ever need for any of these. I'd also do $350 total for all 3 and include 3 2gb sd cards. The only trades I would really be interested in at the time is guns, Cuddeback Attack IR, or possibly other high end name brand hunting items. But would prefer to sale to get the Plotwatchers. Email me if you're interested. Thanks Get all 3 now for $325 shipped conus! $160 each for Cuddebacks or $60 for the moultrie!"

ot a conversion, but the lower and upper are multi-cal, meaning you can remove block from the lower and pin fro upper and change barrel and bolt group and shoot .223 or 5.56 or whatever. but the 9mm is cheaper and a LOT more fun to shoot, just my opinion. anyways rifle has only had around 200rds of ammo through it and it feeds and ejects pretty much anything, seriously. its got a ton of add ons also as can be seen in pics. willing to trade for other high end handguns, 1911s or tactical rifles, u never know, just ask.

Maybe 50rds have been through it. If you are not familier with this, the entire rifle breaks down and stores in the stock, and FLOATS. I am looking for a Ruger MKI/II/II, will add cash if necessary.

From the Henry website:
Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle, our latest take on this innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 2.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear.

When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, waterproof stock, which will float should it take a trip overboard. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action.

The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

The Henry Survival Rifle’s waterproof stock enables it to float if dropped into water. It can be easily retrieved and will still function.

Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments. Plus, the updated receiver is grooved making it easy to top it off with your favorite optics."

This is was made in West Hurrley New York back in 1975 by Auto Ordinance, this is not a piece of junk Kahr. This has the aluminum receiver, there were 2000 made and that was all and this one has an odd 3 digit serial number. This one features a 13” barrel and foregrip, it is not classified as a AOW as it is over 26” long and has no way to attach a butt stock. If you know anything about these guns you just how rare it is. 
This one comes with (6) 32rd stick mags and (2) 50rd Auto Ordinance drums which are rare as well. This also comes with an Auto Ordinance soft bag.

I am firm at $2200 for the setup, this is cheap considering the rarity of the pistol and drums. I prefer trades and will consider all reasonable offers.
