Update 12/18/12 - I've had a lot of interested buyers asking about this firearm. To help those that are interested out I'll provide this information here.  I am reselling this firearm. The previous owner informed me that he has shot approximately 500-600 rounds through it. I have not yet shot this firearm. The previous owner jokingly told me if I were planning on selling to hold off on shooting it because I would end up keeping it. He informed me that he will only buy Dan Wessons from now on. He's sold it because he's in the market for a Valor. I am technically the third owner, but have not yet shot this pistol. Previous owner who has shot it informed me this, ""From a bench rest, that cco out performed my buddy's custom Ed brown.""  Pictures should be up by Thursday.

For sale is a Used .45ACP, Black Aluminum Anodized Frame, Stainless Slide, Black Ceramic Coat, DW Stippled Shadow Grips, Fixed Tritium Night Sights, Bobtailed Grip, Standard Grip Checkering.  This puppy is sweet.  This is a great shooting 1911s and definitely in a different League than stock Kimber, Sig, Springfield.

A custom 1911 built for Concealed Carry in mind. This Dan Wesson is a great take home to the safe, or you can take it out and show off at the range. You'll get looks, and the groupings will be tight. The Shadow Two Tone grips will be sure to get comments.  Take great pride in this Pistol.  Half the price of a Nighthawk Custom / Ed Brown / Les Baers / Wilson Combat  Of course the Dan Wesson is not the same as these listed Pistols, but you still get a lot of the great features and a high quality weapon without the price tag.


MSRP:  $1558.00 USD (From Website)
Can be had New for around $1450+ after fees and taxes

""Our Classic Bobtail has proven so popular due to its concealable profile that we decided to bring you something even more concealable -- the Concealed Carry Officer. This model is built as a classic CCO, with a Commander slide on top of an Officer frame. This combination provides the control and reliability of the Commander with the easy concealment of the Officer frame. With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP in the two provided 7 round flush base magazines, you won’t feel under-gunned.

To make it more comfortable and make it disappear even easier while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce the overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. To help control recoil, we included an undercut trigger guard and our new “Chain Link” pattern on the front strap and mainspring housing. The slide and small parts are coated in the same “Duty” finish that we use on the Valor. Like all of our night-sight models, you will find dual colored Tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration. The CCO wears a medium length trigger shoe to facilitate faster draws and a better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled Shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional.""

In doing more research on the brand I found a lot of people had bad things to say about this manufacturer. I found that the originals sometimes had soft internal parts that would affect reliability. HOWEVER, the original owner of the gun had tried to modify these parts before selling it to a professional gun smith, who I bought it from. After the gunsmith saw the hack job done by the original owner he replaced all of the internal parts, including a custom fit trigger to ensure that the gun will be reliable. 

I don't want to sound like I am trying to push a crappy gun on some one (this is why I'm being honest about what I've learned) but I do want people to know that the issues that led to the general ""hit and miss"" reviews hav
e been resolved in this particular gun.

Comes with:
-Triple K leather Holster
-Old West Styles (actual brand name) leather belt 
         *Belt is made for a big fella, it came with the gun and I haven't resized it
-41 250 grain bullets

Asking $250
My research shows the gun value to be around $425, the holster over $50 and the belt is in the $100 range, not to mention ammo. If you're interested in reloading I can throw in about 300 lead bullets, no extra brass though.

I would rate this pistol in nearly excellent condition.

The gun is chambered in .357 magnum (and thus can also shoot .38 special rounds), and has a 6 round capacity.

I've owned this gun for a couple years, and have fired about 100 rounds through it with perfect reliability (given that it's a revolver and it's a Ruger...what else would you expect).

I'm including with this pistol the following:

Nylon holster
2 Speed Loaders
Hard carry case
Trigger lock
20 rounds of .357 magnum flat nose hard cast lead 180 gr. from Double Tap Ammunition (some of the best backpacking or hunting ammo out there for purposes of defense against 4 legged predators--more info here: http://www.doubletapammo.com/php/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=21_27&products_id=336).

If you need the gun shipped I'll pay for all shipping, and the ffl fees on my end. You'll need to cover your own ffl fees on your end. I suppose it goes without saying that the gun must be shipped to an actual ffl dealer.

If you're local then I'll insist on meeting up at a local ffl dealer, and making the transfer of registration and title clean that way. I'll pay the ffl transfer fees for any local buyers.

Please feel free to ask any questions. If you want more pics, or closer pics of a particular part of the gun or one of the extras just let me know.

No trades, please.

Happy looking."

PS90 STANDARDChambered in the 5.7x28mm cartridge, the PS90 utilizes blowback operation and fires from a closed bolt for greater accuracy and reliability. The PS90’s civilian legal 16.04"" cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel is equipped with an integrated muzzle brake to reduce recoil. Dual magazine latches, cocking handles and an innovative olive drab synthetic thumbhole stock with a molded-in sling attachment point help make the PS90 fully ambidextrous. Models with 10- or 30-round polymer detachable magazines are available.

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A."

List price is $375.00 cash.  The only trade I may consider at this time is a NIB Kahr CW40 (maybe a CW9).  Local sales (within reason), ftf transfer with Ohio ID.  I may consider out of state requests under FFL laws.

I have additional photos if you need them.  I will answer emails in the order that I receive them."

I purchased a new-old-stock Remington 1903A3 barrel, and hired a gunsmith to rebarrel it.  His functional checkout included firing three rounds, and that is all that has been shot through this jewel.
The black parkerized receiver and bolt indicates that this rifle was lend-leased to Greece, post WWII.  It was imported back into the USA, and now into the hands of a collector who cannot shoot high-power bolt action rifles any more, for health reasons.  It shoots the same round as the M1 Garand, which is called M2 ball, in .30-06 caliber.

The 1903A3 is basically a Springfield design 1903 rifle, but with improved sighting system.  The rear sight was moved to the rear of the receiver to increase sight radius.  The rear sight was also redesigned to give more reliable and quick windage adjustment, and easier distance settings.

The serial number on the bolt's handle matches the receiver's serial number.  The Remington barrel that is now installed is stamped Dec. 43, which is the same year the receiver was made.

An excellent shooter with the highly regarded USGI two-groove barrel.  The ""scant"" stock is in excellent condition, and was carefully cleaned and treated with tung oil (correct for this rifle).

Recognizing the popularity of AR rifles, Nikon has developed a new line of riflescopes built to deliver extreme speed, accuracy and shooting confidence. The M-223 line offers five new riflescopes, all engineered for the 223 Rem./5.56mm NATO round with 55-grain polymer tipped bullet with a muzzle velocity of 3240fps. With Nikon's latest reticle and adjustment technologies, the M-223 integrates the same level of quality as the flagship Monarch riflescopes. ""The recent surge in AR-type rifle purchases means there is a new group of customers out there learning just how much fun owning an AR is,"" said Jon LaCorte, senior product marketing manager Nikon Sport Optics. ""We've built the M-223 family to help them enjoy and use their rifles no matter if it's for competition, varmint or predator hunting or just plinking fun."" All of the new M-223 riflescopes feature Nikon's famous fully multicoated optics, up to 95% light transmission, waterproof/fogproof/shockproof performance and lifetime warranty. Designed for AR carbines and popular 3 gun competitions, the 1-4x20 with Point Blank reticle features an extremely large exit pupil for low light performance and a super wide field of view. The all-new Point Blank reticle technology means incredibly accurate and fast shooting from zero to 200 yards thanks to thick reticle posts and purpose-designed 3-MOA center dot for instant targeting on paper or steel plates."

I didn't want just any piggy bank for him. Ceramic wouldn't do and everything else was either too small or too cute. Finally, I came with the perfect solution.

The Ammo Can Bank

It has worked very well for my son. It gives a satisfying clank when a coin is dropped in and he loves carrying it around by the handle. The big opening is awesome for getting the coins out, way better than the small plugs in most banks. It's easy for me to open, but impossible for my toddler.

The lid of the ammo can has a slot cut into it with a brass plate riveted on. The brass is sanded with 1500 grit to give it a subdued look. Felt pads are added to the bottom of the can. The cans are in the normal rugged and used condition. The blank side offers a great area to paint a name or add stickers.

I'm offering them up for $25 while supplies last.

Shipping is $10 extra. They'll be shipped USPS 2-3 day.

Approximate dimensions are 11"" x 7"" x 4""

*Please supervise children while they use this item. As with any heavy metal object, it can cause damage or injury if used for anything other than storing coins."

The predecessor to the Colt Model 1911, with many of the same features, but uniquely different.

Colt built just a few hundred of these each year.  This particular pistol was built in 1912, and was carried by a US Army officer during WWI.  Appears to have been stored inside a leather holster for some time after the war, because it has minor pitting on the slide, and has been [lovingly] reblued, which was the original  factory finish.  All original markings remain easily readable.
A bit of pitting is still visible on the slide, but does not significantly take away from the beauty of this historic piece.  The bore is quite nice, and matches the rest of the pistol.  The original magazine is also included.  
The front and rear sights are designed for very fine aiming, and reminiscent of the early 20th century .22 rifles.  Test fired for function, and is quite accurate, even with vintage ammo.

I also have 150 rounds of newly made ammunition, and will pass them along to the new owner for free, FTF.

These pistols in good condition with original finish are selling for $2,500-$3,000, so I am offering this one at less than 1/2 of the low end value, due to the reblued finish.  I am sure you will agree that the job was done exceptionally well."

The rifle was purchased 10/16/81 from Federal Ordnance and never fired by me.  It has a Smith Corona receiver with a serial number preceded by a “C” indicating there is also a Remington out there with the same serial number without the “C.”  The barrel is a Remington Arms four groove marked 8-44.  Federal Ordnance literature stated that this lot of O3-A3's had been discovered in a National Guard armory, purchased by them, checked out and offered for sale.

The bayonet is a never issued M1905 that is parkerized and unsharpened.  It has two chips in the blade and its serial number indicates it was made in 1907 and is so stamped.  The nicks would go away with sharpening.  A bit of history:  The first M1905 came out in 1906 and produced to 1922 and all of them still in inventory were parkerized in 1919.  A shiny one is reportedly rare.  Many were cut down in WWII as it made the rifle and bayonet difficult to wield in a jungle due to overall length.  A good looking scabbard is also rare as they were belt worn and the leather tips were worn down.  I've seen the bayonet offered by itself for $400.

Included is a correct M1910 scabbard for the bayonet in rough condition, an ammunition belt with 125 rounds of 30-06 ball on stripper clips, cleaning kit in butt and a correct original manual for the firearm.  Federal Ordnance literature at time of purchase states that the rifle is “as issued” complete and in perfect working order having been checked, test fired and head spaced by its armorers.  Very nice looking rifle with correct additions that will make all the other guys at the range jealous.

I'd like to sell this to a fellow Coloradoan or someone in a contiguous state to avoid the hassle and costs of going through a dealer.  Since it is over 50 years old it is eligible for sale direct to a C&R FFL holder if they meet my terms.

Democrats control the Colorado legislature and governorship with pending laws to make all private party sales illegal unless through a dealer.  The cost to purchase and time delay in taking possession will only go up should (and probably will) occur.  Don't hesitate."

Milled Receiver. Comes with 6, 30 round magazines! Similar to an AK 47 in its looks only, very fine rifle thats extremely accurate. $750 cash.

Here is a description and a generic picture i lifted from the internet, my rifle is identical to it...

Sa vz. 58 Comparison to AK-47 Type Rifle with Stamped Receiver
All vz. 58 rifles possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK-47s are stamped.
Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
CNC machining on a vz. 58 receiver takes 2 1/2 hours; a stamped AK-47 receiver takes seconds to produce.
The bolt of the vz. 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
The vz. 58 can be reloaded with stripper clips while the magazine is inserted in the rifle.
The vz. 58 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the vz. 58.
The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the vz. 58.
The vz. 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools.
The alloy magazine of the vz. 58 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lb. vs. .84 lb.)
The vz. 58 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure.
By the end of the 1950s, the Sa vz. 58 military issued assault rifle had obtained the impressive combination of weight and length (6.42 lbs and 33.30 inches for fixed stock) to make this rifle the elite among military issued assault rifles of its class."

A tribute to attributes. Specialized features are the hallmark of the Pro Carry families. It has a shorter 4-inch barrel that make it easy to carry. Chambered in .45 ACP, Kimber mid-size pistols are an ideal compromise of size and weight. With a variety of options and features, they cover every need from duty and concealed carry to home defense. More importantly, these pistols do not compromise quality or dependability. The Tacoma, Washington, P.D. extensively tested Pro Carry models, finding them to be the most dependable firearm put through the paces in over 20 years. They checked the records, comparing Kimber not only with other pistols, but with rifles and shotguns as well. When you carry a Kimber, you carry with absolute confidence.
