and folding stock, flip up sights and the owner’s manual. At last, the SCAR 17S is here. 

The new rifle is a semi-automatic-only version of the military’s selective-fire MK17 Mod 

0 or Special Ops Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) Heavy. Chambered in .308 Win./7.62x51 

mm NATO, the gun is bigger and more powerful than its .223 Rem./5.56x45 mm NATO 

predecessor, the SCAR 16S, but, thankfully, not objectionably so. No longer constrained 

by limitations of that gun’s smaller receiver and chambering, the bigger SCAR 17S 

greatly expands the potential utility of the SCAR platform. One can argue that the 

SCAR Heavy was what Special Operations Command (SOCOM) wanted all along: a 

modern carbine chambered in 7.62x51 mm NATO that is lightweight, reliable and 

accurate.

Experience the long-range accuracy, downrange power, exceptional reliability and 

match winning versatility of the FN SCAR™ 17S, the semi-auto only version of the U.S. 

Special Operations Command’s newest service rifle. Chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO 

(308 Win.), the SCAR 17S features a free-floating, cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC 

16.25” barrel with hard chromed bore, 1 in 12” twist. Fully-ambidextrous operating 

controls instantly adapt the SCAR 17S to any user or any shooting position. The 

receiver-integrated MIL-STD 1913 optical rail plus three accessory rails enable 

mounting of a wide variety of scopes, electronic sights, tactical lights and lasers. The 

telescoping, side-folding polymer stock is fully adjustable for comb height and length of 

pull, making it ideal for Heavy Metal 3-Gun matches. O/A length is 28.5” folded, 38.5” 

extended. This gun weighs 8 pounds empty."

I have a Para Ordnance 1911 for sale. It is the Operation Iraqi Freedom edition that was only sold to soldiers serving in The Iraq War. Not many of these were made and even less are on the market. Most of them are still owned by soldiers. As far as I am aware this is also the only one on Armslist. It comes with 3 magazines and about 60 rounds of 45acp. I am taking offers and will also consider a SOCOM II or a M1A/M14 for trade. I also MIGHT take a CZ 75 in on trade. You can contact me on here or text me at 715-894-094zero.

Furthermore, the handguard has dual aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

It comes as it shipped from the factory with hard case, lock, manuals, test casings and one buckmark magazine.

I also have a 5.5"" spare barrel that I will give the buyer of the pistol an option to purchase.  It is not new, but is in good condition.

I'm asking $425 for the Buckmark URX Micro, $75 for the barrel.  Will sell together for $475.

Prefer FTF in North Jackson.  Will be on the coast this weekend.  Can possibly meet along the way."

This one has dark wood on it that only has one very small knick in it.

The is very slight petina under the bluing but still has a good sheen to the finish.  The bayonet included is in equal condition.  The bore still is good, it has one very small hickup in the bore about two inches from the end of the barrel but I would feel very confident shooting this one repeatedly in a heartbeat.

I have no idea how I'll ever get by without your continued business.  I would 
like to sell you the ammo for whatever price you deem fair.  Unfortunately, both 
cases left here about an hour ago, in the trunk of a car driven by one very 
happy customer.  Happy buyer + happy seller = a win for capitalism and the free 
market!  Here's the part you may not like: he has plans to sell one of the cases 
to a co-worker for $100 more than he paid.  The nerve!  Would you like his info, 
so that you may harass him about his actions?
I have a challenge for you: explain your position against free market economics.  
You seem to have taken a real beef with me putting the ammo at a price that is 
high, no doubt.  I know that.  But it only lasted 12 hours on the market.  So, 
you think I should be ashamed for not selling at a price that YOU like.  Explain 
why.  What you call 'gouging' is referred to as market pricing.  Who are you to 
determine what my prices should be?  What do you care?  If you wanted the ammo, 
you had a chance to buy it, at my price.  Or you can shop around, or wait 
outside Aim's door for a shipment to come in.  Buying from someone other than me 
is your choice.
Do you own stocks?  Let's pretend you do.  Say you invested money in a company.  
Say that company's stock price doubled.  Would you sell it to me for 60% of what 
it was currently trading at?  That would still give you a net gain of 10%.  What 
if I called you names for not selling it to me at a price that I liked, and 
deemed fair?  What if that company's stock had doubled, as a result of some 
tragedy?  Would you be 'riding the coattails' by selling it at market value, 
instead of a price that it could've been bought for pre-tragedy?  What if it 
took a $30,000 inventory order to allow you the opportunity to buy that stock 
before it doubled in price?  And then I dumb-fucked you for not selling it way 
under market value?  I assume you would tell me to mind my own fucking business.  
How about if I threatened to slander you over the Internet for making a profit, 
due to a well measured business decision?
You can claim to know about distributors pricing, but I highly doubt you know 
much about this industry, especially right now.  Nothing is set in stone.  You 
don't know what I had to do, or what I had to pay to get that ammo.  I paid more 
than retail prices were two months ago.  Question to you: If the market tanked 
before that ammo delivery arrived, and the prices fell back to 'normal' 
overnight, I would be underwater on it.  I'd have more in it than it was worth.  
Would you expect someone to pay me more for it, than they could get it for 
somewhere else?  Well, fuck no.  That's market economics.  But I assume you 
would be okay with me losing money on a gamble, although you want to put a limit 
on how much I can make on a winning bet.  Well, fuck you.  That's communism, and 
this is America.
I truly do hope that you reply to this email with some real answers to my 
questions.  I'm not being a smart-ass.  I want to know what your answer to these 
questions are.  I would like to know why you think the free market is okay when 
buying, but not selling.  This is not bread, baby formula or gasoline.  It's 
ammo for Christ sake.  There can not be 'gouging' on discretionary products.  I 
expect you will reply with some immature response with some random comments 
about me being an asshole dealer, but I challenge you to put some thought into 
this and give me an honest discussion.  I hope you can man-up and explain 
yourself, instead of just talking a bunch of shit over an email.  Let's see what 
kind of man you really are.  Can you defend your position, or will I just get 
another 'fuck you, you're a dick for doing something I don't like' response?  
From the correspondence we've had thus far, I know what I'm expecting.  I just 
hope I'm wrong, and you are man enough to respond with a legit argument.  I'm 
very curious to hear what makes a communist mind tick."

The ammo all appears to be clean and shiny in good shape. Good brass, non-corrosive, reloadable.

I have been looking at the prices of this particular ammo, and it is selling anywhere from $10 per 20 round box to $15 in stores, if they can get it in stock, and they are usually limiting the amount that can be bought. So this is a good chance to get a stash of ammo now.

Steyr M95
8x56r
Matching numbers
Clean bore
accurate as heck
Rear sight has elevation adjustment, (marked in Schritten, 1 Schritten is approx 2ft.)
Rifle comes with an original sling
Bayonet, with scabbard, (not the greatest shape, good steel, but the guy I bought it from used a grinder on it, so it needs to be cleaned up.)
2.5 boxes of surplus ammo, (25 rounds, 5 clips)
~20 reusable clips (normally sell for $3-$5 each by themselves)
nearly 50 brass that ARE reloadable, new manufacture brass.
Shoots beautifully

Steyr 1911 (made in 1915)
9mm Steyr, (NOT the same as 9mm para, 9mm Largo, .38 super, though it is a variation of 9x23)
Re-blued by a professional
Comes with original wood grips, as well as modern polymer replacements
8 clips, (yes, it is a clip fed pistol)
12 rounds of new manufacture ammo, plus the spent brass I was able to find.
~450 rounds of surplus 9mm Steyr, apparently made sometime in the 30's, (no guarantees that it will fire, some worked, but chances are they more than likely wont work, but they are included at component prices, so pull the bullets and load them into 9mm, .380, or other .357 cal rounds)
This gun also shoots fairly well. Works best on a cold barrel.
