This GLOCK is the standard GLOCK 9mm frame (G17) but with a .45 round. Made for those with smaller hands that have trouble firing the standard .45ACP.  Has less then 300 rounds down the chamber. Bought brand new in 2003 when this gun and round was first introduced. Has been my night stand firearm since day 1. Pistol has minimal wear and tear as expected from a gun with so few rounds fired. Few scratches on the slide and normal wear on the barrel (see pictures). Decal grip has been added to the grip, under the trigger guard and on the rear of the slide for max grip. Very comfortable but can be removed depending on owners preference. Gun comes with 375 rounds of ammunition. (80 rds Winchester Super X 185gr silvertip hollow point, 157 rds Winchester 230 gr BEB FMJ, 138 rds FAE 185 gr FMJ). 2 factory GLOCK 10 rnd magazines with GLOCK speed loader, adjustable rear sites, fobus paddle holster, GLOCK factory hard case with all initial purchase items (GLOCK owners manual, safety brochure, slide lock, barrel brush and cleaning rod, factory fired brass for identification). All S/N match (Frame, Slide, Barrel).

3 hi-cap mags
regular Glock stuff: case, speedloader, lock, brush

What's unique about this Glock is that it was made for the Bergen County Police Dept and has their insignia engraved on the right side of the slide. The serial number begins with BCPD, and based off the limited info I can find on the BCPD Glocks, I'm led to believe that these are of low number made. This particular one is #18. 

It's in great condition. I personally have not shot any .357sigs out of it because when I bought it, I bought the Lone Wolf 9mm barrel and glock conversion parts. The conversion does not come with the gun because I've already sold it to a friend. 

The reason I'm selling this is because I'm consolidating my handguns to 9mm. This is one of my favorite pieces, but it isn't anything but a safe queen, so I might as well sell it."

It comes with 2 10-round magazines, 1 20 rounder, and 1 30 rounder.  

If you do some research on this gun you will see that jamming can be a problem with these, but I have found that if you keep it very clean and use high quality (non waxy) ammunition you can minimize these problems.

Some of these magazines feed better than others, I have heard the ones with steel lips are the best but I don't have any of those.  It accepts any Ruger 10/22 magazine, so they are really easy to find.  The barrel is knurled but not threaded.

Manufacturer: AMERICAN TACTICAL IMPORTS.  The GSG 5 is an identical replication of the MP 5, except one great thing: Its a 22 cal. Because of the low cost of ammunition the GSG 5 makes a perfect plinking rifle, training rifle or a serious varmint hunting rifle. Nothing of its kind has ever been introduced in the United States. The user will be impressed with its weight and performance. If you are a varmint hunter you will be encouraged by all the options the GSG-5 has to offer with its railing system, faux suppressor and easy change magazine. For training purposes, the GSG-5 is a low-cost alternative for Law Enforcement agencies and departments that use MP5’s in the field.

I am simply not going to be able to keep this 1911, personal reasons, this is honestly the most accurate Wilson I've fired in the 5"" line.

The checkering style and slide serrations are wicked looking. Feel perfect, no sharp checkering points but tons of grip

I've been to the range once with it, not a mark, it is as new as it gets with a used label. You will NOT be disappointed with this weapon. If you like clean light breaking triggers and deadly accuracy, this is your kinda pistol.

Very clean, well kept Browning HP.  Has adjustable sights, factory hard satin/black two-tone, box & paperwork.  Original Browning Pachmayr grips & a set of factory plastic combat grips.  4# trigger pull, ambidextrous safety, mag safety has been deactivated.  Very smooth & deadly accurate.  Belgium made parts & assembled in FN's Portugal factory.  I've always wanted one of these & now I want something else.  My pistol is in perfect condition & I expect any trade offer to be the same.  I've only had it a few months, but it's been out several times & performed flawlessly.  $800 cash or make an offer.  Will consider other 9mm trades involving a Sig 226e2, H&K USP 9mm, AR in 9mm, Glock 26+ cash, etc. I'm not interested in old military relics or leftover Cold War guns.  Nor am I interested in anything non-gun related.  This is not a HP clone, it's a Browning.  Thanks for looking.  Call or text REDACTED

I've had a lot of interest in this, but I'm really looking for cash.  It's worth my asking price.  If you have a 9mm AR, I'd be interested in a trade, or a straight across trade for a Sig 226e2.  Any other trade offers would involve cash.  Feel free to make a reasonable offer, but I'm not interested in dropping my price & other than the trades I am looking for, specifically, I won't offer more than a pawn shop will for credit.  Keep that in mind when making trade offers."

Everything is in excellent condition and works with almost no scratches or wear, everything is priced fairly for their condition and prices are firm.

The reason I'm selling is because I can't play guitar anymore, I messed up my left hand in Iraq while serving in the Army and there's no use in keeping something you can't use.

I'll consider straight across trades for a decent shotgun, rifle (no .22's) or a cheap running motorcycle.

This gun gets phenomenal reviews from its owners.

I picked this gun up about a week ago from my FFL. It is a large frame .45 caliber pistol, built very solid. This model has the gorgeous blued finish and is pretty rare compared to the polycoat version that sells for less. This gun is brand new in box, hasn't even had a round chambered in it. Comes with all original paperwork and packaging (down to the UPS box it came in) other than the warranty card which I sent in.

I absolutely love the look of the gun, but the slight upkeep on the finish is a bit too much for me. I'm looking to get the cheaper polycoat version of the gun instead.

First off, I'm not looking to sell out right at the moment, trades only, FTF in the Rochester, or Finger Lakes area. 

With that said.... I love this Walther, great handling, excellent reliability, it just feels comfortable to hold and shoot. This pistol was manufactured in Germany, serial number puts it to be manufactured in 1999...pre S & W. Its considered a first generation AS (anti stress trigger) model, as evident by the rear slide serrations, and ""ski hump"" inside the bottom of the trigger guard. I would rate condition at 90+%  ....there is very slight lightening of the tennifer finish on the sharp edges of the slide, not very noticeable, and a few very minor blemishes on the polymer frame, most likely from holstering.It still looks great, functions perfectly, feeds and extracts without issue. The decocker is a nice feature as well. It comes with a factory case, manuals, magazine disassembly tool, variety of front sight posts, 3 interchangeable back-straps, 2 factory 10-rnd magazines, and a fobus paddle holster. Its a beautiful pistol, but I'm just looking for something......different.  I may have fired a max of 500 rds through it since I have owned it. I'd be happy to send more pics to anyone thats seriously interested as well.

 I'm located in Macedon, near Rochester and the Finger Lakes. I'd be happy to meet someone in Eastern Monroe, Wayne, Ontario, counties and most of the Finger Lakes region. FTF pistol permit holders only."
