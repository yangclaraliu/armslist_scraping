I paid a premium for them back then.  I took one out of the box as my 'shooter' but only fired it on one visit to the range.  The other three are still in their original boxes and still in their hermetically sealed packages.

Two different guns are shown in the photos, my 'shooter' and one of the other three that I would like to sell or trade as shown still in the package.  Obviously you cannot clearly see the firearm trough the plastic package and since I do not want to disturb the 'seal,' it is necessary to show what the rifle for sale looks like by displaying my 'shooter.'

The original 'green label' box, manual, cleaning kit, and both 20 rounds magazines is what the buyer will receive.

I am not a dealer, therefore, I can sell this to a resident of Indiana without paperwork.  Outside of Indiana requires a transfer to a FFL dealer.

The price is $2,500.00 FIRM.  I will consider all trades, cash plus trades, etc.

The Ruger® LCR (Lightweight Compact Revolver) w/Crimson Trace® Lasergrip® 
This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. 
Features: 
** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish. 
** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. 
** Crimson Trace® Lasergrip® offers the advantages of a laser sighting system.

I have put only 40 rounds through it.  I simply prefer to carry my new Glock 26 over this LCP.  I just checked on a website and this pistol was selling for $408 + shipping.  Recently I was at a gun shop in Dallas and the price for this Hard Chrome LCP was $369.99 + tax which comes to: $400.51.  At $330 - this is an incredible deal.

The LCP comes with absolutely everything from the manufacturer.  Box, papers, RUGER OEM olive drab zippered carrying case AND a BlackHawk front pocket holster that was $15.  The BlackHawk front pocket holster is much better than the Desantis holsters in my opinion because the BlackHawk has a sewn base which does not allow pocket lint to inundate your barrel. 

The price of $330 is FIRM since it is too low for this pistol already.

I got this almost new in trade and it has only about 150-200 rounds total through it, so it's not even through the break-in period yet. For those few rounds I have fired, it's been exceptionally accurate and trouble-free. It's hand-fitted and very tight, so it did not like light reloads, but factory rounds fired and functioned perfectly. It has 3-dot sights with a standard white-dot Novak sight on the rear and a Novak green-dot fiber sight up front.

This comes with two 7-round magazines but no box. Also, I have a copy of the gunsmith's spec sheet showing each part, the value and all the work that was done to it. Counting parts alone, this is valued at well over $1500 retail.

I'm not looking for anything particular in trade but whatever catches my eye (although I do have a preference for .45). For a sale price, I'm looking for around $1100. Of course, I'm willing to negotiate as to multiple gun trades or gun + cash. I'm willing to travel a reasonable distance to meet halfway as well."

I am the original owner and have fired less than 300rds through it. It truly is LNIB and I have more pics if you'd like them emailed to you. I had the barrel shroud replaced with a BATFE compliant shroud from ATI under their recall program. I mounted the sight less than a month ago (still not sighted in). It is a Leapers 5MOA Green/Red dot 1x30mm. You can find more specs on MidwayUSA, that is where I bought it from. It comes with everything that originally came in the box when I bought it (take down tools, cleaning brush, one 22 rd mag and whatever else I never took out of the box), the mount and red dot. This one is a pre H&K lawsuit rifle. ATI doesn't make this style rifle anymore as a result of that settlement with H&K. They are no longer allowed to import them in this configuration and made some design changes that I did not like. This rifle is a blast to shoot. Buyers with a valid AR CHL preferred but not required. Buyer must also agree to sign a Firearm Bill of Sale."

For those that don't know, .400 Corbon is basically a .45 caliber case necked down to hold a .40 caliber bullet.  It is a snappy cartridge with tremendous knock down power.  This gun has a ported barrel which reduces muzzle flip and increases sight recovery time greatly.  

This gun is factory engraved #110 of 1000.

looking to get a rifle, i had fun building this but it's time for a new project.  Obviosly you can see there is a lot of money in this gun, so no low ball offers.  serious inquires only.  I can send some pics of groups this thing shoots, pretty amazing.  I know I won't get everything back i put into it, that's not how it works, I spent 1500 building it and the pistol and laser grips would cost you 900 so i think that 725 is a very fair price, that gives you all the other upgrades for free."

This is an incredibly little pistol. It is as accurate at 7 yards as our 92FS or P229. We have put about 150 rounds through this and never had a single issue, it is superbly built and one of the finest CCW pistols available. The one issue we had was that it would bite a bit into the back of our thumb, so I bought a limbsaver grip wrap (which will be included) and now it is a pleasure to shoot!!!

As mentioned this is near new, we just broke it in with less than three boxes of ammo. This comes with the case, manual, both backstraps, lock etc. This one feature the 7 round magazine, that's critically important since the 6 round mag leaves your pinky floating in space!

None of them have even came close to being in as good a shape as this one because most all of them were used hard and put up wet. Again, this gun is a serious collector peice."

The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR15/M16 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock for rifles with A1/A2 fixed stocks. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both cheek riser height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten the LOP by 0.25"" or extend it by 0.75"". Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Machined aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shaft provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock.

Bushnell's upscale Elite 4200 4-16x40mm AO (adjustable objective parallax focus) incorporates the following features:

Rainguard exterior lens coating 
Fully multi-coated optics 
One-piece main tube forged from an aluminum-titanium alloy 
Waterproof, fogproof, shockproof construction 
Dry nitrogen filled 
¼ MOA (or finer) click, resettable, fingertip windage and elevation knobs 
95% light transmission at 550 NM--claimed to be the world's brightest riflescopes 
The Bushnell Rainguard lens coating is hydrophobic (water repellant) and prevents fogging by causing condensation from rain, fog, or even your breath, to bead up into much smaller droplets than on standard coatings. Smaller droplets scatter less light for a clearer view. This patented Bushnell coating really does exactly what is claimed.

Bushnell Elite 4200 scopes are made with high quality optics and offer crisp, contrasty views of the target. Flare and optical aberrations are generally well controlled. Ring positioning and mounting latitude are generally good. They have proven to be durable and reliable in the field and are suitable for a wide variety of applications. Bushnell is a solid company and their customer service is generally good. 

In summation, the Bushnell Elite 4200 line is a solid contender in the competitive four-star/medium-high price class scope market. Their particular strengths include very good optics, excellent features, rugged construction and they are backed by a reputable, well established firm.

Yugoslavian PAP M59/66: Added 22 mm grenade launcher which appears visually like a flash suppressor or muzzle brake on the end of the barrel. Front sight has a fold-up ""ladder"" for use in grenade sighting (main sights on the A1 version have flip up phosphorus or tritium night sights). When the grenade sight is raised, the gas system is automatically blocked and the action must be manually cycled—rifle grenades must be fired with blank cartridges for safety, and this feature helps ensure that a live round is not loaded from the magazine. The gas system is not automatically unblocked when the sight is folded, however, and must be manually opened to again allow semi-automatic operation.[5] Barrel was not chrome-lined before about 1970. Both the grenade launcher and grenade sight are NATO spec. Stock is typically made from beech wood. Many of the ones imported into the US were actually used in military action and as such many were in less than pristine shape or had unmatching serial numbered parts. Some have stocks that were dinged, scratched or even intentionally carved or notched by the soldiers issued the rifles, often with a variation of the Serbian coat of arms. There is some collector interest in rifles with carved or marked stocks.  I will even throw in the leaper scope that came with it, nothing fancy, just a scope!!!"

I am selling a few of my pistols for an investment into a new toy. I picked this up new from Cabela's and it has only been fired once at the range. I fired about 150 rounds. These guys are hard to find in stock. 

This is the newly released XDM Compact. These come loaded with upgrades such as upgraded sites, match grade hammer forged barrel, minimal reset trigger, ajustable back strack system, and the option to use the included magazines as a full size 19+1, or the compact 13+1. 

These kits come complete with adjustable back straps, holster, mag pouch and loading assit tool. The loading assist tool can clip onto the mag pouch for convenience. 

Very well thought out package with quality and accuracy out of the box. 

Price is firm due to the new condition of the pistol. 

Update:  I had pulled this listing, but I decided to relist. I was so impressed with this pistol during a recent defense pistol class that I decided to uprade to a xdm custom. This package now includes two extra 19 round mags!  I fired an additional 400 rounds without fail!  Price is firm since I am including two extra 19 round mags.

Fired 50rounds with no issues. Box and papers included. Single owner.

Stoeger’s new Double Defense side-by-side shotgun is a straightforward, rugged and reliable home defense shotgun. Ideal for use in tight quarters and tense situations, the Stoeger Double Defense with its traditional break-action and short, efficient design is easy to load and quick to deploy in an emergency.
     A double-barrel shotgun has been the defensive firearm of choice for generations, but Stoeger has added practical, up-to-date features to the “tried-and-true” double gun. The Double Defense is chambered for 2-3/4- and 3-inch shells, in either 12- or 20-gauge. The tactical-length 20-inch ported barrels feature fixed, improved cylinder chokes. The fast, single-trigger design and convenient, tang-mounted automatic safety makes the Stoeger Double Defense ideal for home security use.
     The Double Defense gun is outfitted with a green, fiber-optic front sight and comes standard with two Picatinny Rail accessory mounts: one on the receiver for red-dot sights and a second factory-installed rail under the barrels for attaching targeting lasers or tactical lights. All metal surfaces are finished in matte blue and come complete with non-reflective matte black hardwood stock and forearm."

Not interested in any other caliber at this time.  Any make or model will be considered, although I am not a collector and do not want to spend nearly a thousand dollars on a museum quality piece.

I prefer nickle, chrome, or stainless.  Not a fan of blued, particularly if it is excessively worn or scratched, but may make an exception for an interesting piece if the price is right.

I am not a gun snob.  I will consider FIE, Heritage, Excam, Titan, Best, etc.

Looking specifically for an INOX stainless Jetfire.

Also interested in a Astra Cub in this caliber only.

Some interest in Star.

Very interested in Spanish pistols.

No interest in Browning, Bauer or Colt.

Strongly prefer hammer fired.

Bolt serial # matches that of the metal of the rifle on the grip. At some point a recoil pad was added as well. Also being up front and honest this rifle despite shooting well doesn't extract bullets and will need the extractor and bolt worked on. There is an excellent gunsmith in Ozark,Mo that works on these type rifles and it shouldn't cost too much to fix. For this price it would be worth fixing. These rifles are all going for up to $300 now or more if in decent shape. The rifling and bore are in great shape, good lands and grooves with shiny bore from what I can tell. Rifle shoots well seems to be accurate enough with Prvi Partison 150 Sp ammo at 50 yds. Rifle has a 22 inch barrel; Farker-Hale England is stamped onto the front sight area. This gun looks good and would make a great collector/shooter or deer hunting rifle. Asking $175obo, thanks for looking.
