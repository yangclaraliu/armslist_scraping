This is not a WASR-10. It is a matching numbers AKM from Tenessee Guns International. Tapco G2 fire controls, tight mag well, welded on slant compensator, but it shoots straight. 6 years ago when WASR's were $350 and $400, these were going for $520 plus. Now you'll be lucky to find a WASR under $500 unless someone grinded the finish off to make it look like Call of Duty. I bought it for $600 at the gunshow in Jacksonville. Since then, I put 20 rounds through it and put all Tapco Furniture on it. I just really want an underfolder right now so I'm looking to sell it. Price with all Tapco furniture and a magpro 30 round mag is $620 FIRM. The only thing I would trade for is an underfolder AK, a polish underfolder would be fantastic but manufacturer is not important. The only other way I would part with this AK is for an HK pistol like a USP .45 compact (my favorite) or a P2000. Don't care how used it is but if it's new and you want cash to boot, look elsewhere. I won't ask for cash if someone is willing to trade me an underfolder in similar condition to my AK even if it's an old WASR. Just has to function right and all the parts (like the mag well) need to fit decent like mine. I also have an ad up just for AK furniture."

Excalibur pull rope, quick detach quiver. Very good condition string replaced last year. Horton has a knob on the side that adjust the original sight up and down. I put a little glue on this so it doesn't move, a utility knife would make quick work of freeing the knob up. This was in my opinion a design issue for Horton and I have noticed that the new up scale Horton crossbow doesn't have that. It is easy to bump and change zero of your sight in hunting conditions.

Why the price is $525 is because it comes with the original 2 clips with an addition of 3 separate order clips (total 5 clips) every clip holds 15 rounds, a case for the gun, and a open carry holster. You are getting a great deal on this and I will not go down another penny because I am already going in the hole.

469,http://www.armslist.com/posts/497469,For Sale:  Collectible Browning 4X Rimfire Rifle Scope,"Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 225,"Listed On: Thursday, August 2, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a collectible Browning 4X rimfire scope made by Redfield. I removed it from a 1971 model Browning BL-22 I purchased that was also in superb condition.  It has the ¾” tube and I left the attached rings in place.  I’m not a collector so I would like it to go to someone who can appreciate its collectible status.

This Browning 4x Rimfire scope was made between 1965 and 1976. FOV is 24 feet at 100 yards.  Evidently when these scopes were marketed under the Redfield name they were called the Sport-STER 4. The STER apparently stood for Standard Eye Relief.  The Browning ocular bell was smooth- not a serrated 3-ring design like Redfield.  Otherwise, it’s supposed to be the same scope.

The optics are clear and crisp and there is no damage of any kind to the gloss black finish.  The reticle cross hairs are a very fine target style.  There are no lens covers (I’ve never seen one with them).  Because I did not attempt to remove the rings I do not know if there are any mounting marks beneath them.  

The hard to find steel (not aluminum) rings are a very nice sturdy quality, nothing like the stuff you will find on the cheap scopes at Wally World.  Each side of the tube clamps has a recessed screw and each dovetail clamp has 2 screws for secure mounting.

The gold filled stamping on the reticle housing is nice and clear.  It consists of the magnification power, a serial number and the Browning name.  Both metal adjustment covers are also in excellent unmarked condition.  

The ocular bell diameter is 1.15” and the objective bell diameter is 1.10”.  Overall length is 9 1/8”.  The diminutive dimensions make for a really nice look on any rimfire and the optical quality with the fine cross hairs is on a par with newer scopes in this price range.

This scope looks to be in about a 98% condition.  You would be hard pressed to tell it from one that is NIB (well…except there is no box).

According to “Old Gunsights And Rifle Scopes” by Nick Stroebel (2008), the value was $150-$300 at publication.  As you might imagine, they are becoming more desirable as time passes and, when you can find them, they are currently selling for about $250 - $325."

No trades.

For sale is an earlier model (pre 1970) Browning Hi-Power 9mm pistol. Comes with plastic case, manual, 2 14rd mags, Hogue grips, original honey colored wood grips.

All true Brownings are made by FN Herstal in Belgium. The earlier Brownings have the Made in Belgium rollmark only. Post 1970, Brownings were manufactured in Belgium and assembled in Portugal.
This pistol has the Made in Belgium rollmark only.

The slide, barrel, magazines, and all internal parts are Browning. The frame and slide stop lever are FEG. There were many instances in the earlier Brownings where the cast frames would crack and render the pistol useless. The only way to have a working gun, was to find a Browning frame, which was nearly impossible, or use a FEG frame, which has never had any issues with cracking. The pistol's lower price than usual Browning reflects this. The sights are custom made Millet type.

I have refinished the hand guards to match the rare Bakelite mags i also finally got and it looks alot better compaired to the dull standard wood. I also put on the underfolder struts a 550 cord weave for both sides and the end aswell. Makes shooting it 1000 times better. (better cheek weld, doesnt heat up, and no more cold bare metal) The muzzle break is a threaded AK-74 style Tapco. But will include the stock slant muzzle break too. Comes with cleaning rod, and all the parts are extremely fitted and it cycles smoother than any AK i've ever shot.

The ak will come with two 30 round mags but the bakelite is top dollar and is also included but i will drop the price if you dont want the Bakelite (which im trying to sell on another post, i have three all together)

But i am just putting this on the market to see what offers i get. I'm in no hurry to lets this leave my gun cabinet but cash is king and for the right trade like always something could be worked out im sure.

Have had too many people say ""I'll definitely take it for cash."" And then never bother replying when asked where and when to meet.  It should go without saying, but don't waste anyone's time unless you intend to follow through.  

That being said, the rifle functions perfectly.  Not one single issue or keyhole in 300 rounds  that I personally put through it with surplus ammo at 50 and 100 meters.
  Only selling to fund another purchase.  Polish build quality and machine work is immaculate, even surpassing Russian built Saigas I have converted.  It's simply a nice rifle, cheap to shoot and maintain and with AK reliability.

  Comes with original box, paperwork, two 30 round all metal Polish surplus mags, and two 30 round Tapco mags, one black and one bakelite orange.

 Folding stock is factory and easily changed out to any fixed AK stock.  Also includes a Polish military sling, factory bipod, and an excellent condition type II bayonet/scabbard with matching numbers but no belt hanger.  Will also throw in 120 rounds of Russian 7N6 ammo.

MAKE AN OFFER.  Need gone now.

Only real trades I'm looking for is possibly a Russian SKS in excellent condition or any other interesting (original configuration) SKS plus cash or AK type guns.  Also seeking an RPK, and I could throw in cash to boot depending on weapon, build, and condition.

Stainless Steel & Double/Single action 8-shot revolver.
This gun comes with the red dot front sight, and it's a DREAM TO SHOOT.
Accuracy with this thing is incredible, and it will definitely help you shoot your other larger caliber weapons better.
This gun was bought NIB from my local dealer about 3 months ago.
I test fired this weapon at the range with 20 rounds of CCI before I bought it, and haven't had the chance to shoot it since.
I just started medical school, so I need to sell anything I won't be using much to gain some profit.
This weapon is in pristine condition.
It will come with a Hogue Monogrip for better target acquisition.

The gun will come with the original box with serial number stamps, wax paper, warranty, test fire factory brass, user manual, and safety manual.

These guns sell for $759 + tax/licensing new..that's almost $850-900 total.
I'm only asking $550, that is including the $25 for the hogue monogrip.   It's a steal at this price and don't expect it to be online for long.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

This is the Swedish version of the German K98 8mm. The Swedish built rifle is made by none other than Husqvarna of the chainsaw fame. They started out building excellent weapons. Thier logo is still the H inside the muzzle end of a rifle with iron sights above it. 

This rifle is chambered in the 6.5x55 cartridge. Very easy and affordable to buy anywhere. This round can drop a deer easily so it's great for huinting. 

It appears to have never been fired! The bore has the deepest and most crisp lands and grooves that I've ever seen. I took it to the range and it punched out the center diamond of the bullseye right away.

The rifle is is excellent shape. There is a muzzle break installed onto the threaded barrel which seems to help with kick and climb. The original leather strap is included. This is a gorgeous piece of history that is still as functional as the day it was made.

I also have a Yugoslavian SKS 7.62 x 39 with the grenade launcher. There is a Tapco 20 rnd magazine and it's mounted in an ATI Dragonov stock. If you are interested in both rifles, I will combine the prices and cut a deal, just let me know.

1. Volquartsen MKII Hammer Bushing - Eliminates the magazine disconnect. This allows you to fire the pistol without a magazine, and also allows the magazine to eject like it should (it is too tight, and generally needs to be pulled out by hand even when released if this mod is not completed). Also makes the trigger pull a bit smoother, and lighter by decreasing friction.

2. Volquartsen Target Sear - Reduces trigger pull by a little over 1lb., and creates a shorter, faster, cleaner breaking pull.

3. Bolt Release ""slingshot"" modification - Allows the bolt lever to be released by gravity, and the bolt can be released by retracting it instead of pressing the bolt release.
