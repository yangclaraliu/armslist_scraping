Everybody's got a 1911, but who out there has a 1912?

This is a pretty rare pistol in very good shape for its age- the finish is faded, but there's none of the rust, pits, bad rebluing job, or other defects that most examples have. Also, it's not a commercial Chilean contract piece, but an actual Austrian issued WW1 example, completely matching numbers, and otherwise about as good an example as you'll find on the open market.

If you're not familiar with the design, this pistol uses a twisting barrel with three big lugs on it, and feeds from an internal magazine- you reload it from the top with stripper clips. Any old 9mm or 7.62x25 Tokarev clip should work, or even a modified .223 stripper clip. The idea was it's less parts to get lost and less chance of dirt entering the mechanism.  

Caliber is 9x23mm Steyr. If you can find one, there are drop-in WW2 production barrels that allow you to fire 9mm Luger, but this pistol is unconverted.

Included is one fifty-round box of collectable/shootable noncorrosive 9mm Steyr commercial FMJ ammo.

Info on the LEM Model:
Developed especially for the U.S. government, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a USP DAO (Double-Action Only) model with a unique trigger mechanism. This mechanism improves the double action trigger performance and reduces the weight of the DAO trigger pull to 7.5–8.5 pounds-force (33–38 N), uses a stronger hammer spring, and shortens the trigger reset. Aside from the LEM mechanism, it is identical to the USP Variant 7 (DAO) model."

Its a commemorative N. Carolina Highway Patrol 50 year anniversary. Its never been fired and is a beautiful gun. Only 1200 were made. The story behind this gun is an officer lost his life in the line of duty and the gun was given to his daughter in his honor. She moved to California and was intimidated by the laws and had a friend hold it for her since 1979. The gun sat in his safe until about 6 months ago, when he was finally able to sell it with her blessing. You will not find the value of this gun easily. I finally found it in the Smith and Wesson Standard catalog of prices. In 2007, it was worth 12-1500. IN 2012 s&w verbally told me via a phone call i made to them that it is in the area of 15-1800 currently. I posted a pic of the price from the catalog."

Very few marks other than operating marks where the safety is, and light scratches.  Looks pretty much the same as the day I bought it.  Fired less than 50 rounds through it.   

The Saiga-12 self-loading smooth bored shotgun is intended for professional and sport hunting of small-and medium-size game under any climatic conditions.

This shotgun is built on the famous AK-47 action that has been proven by years of very reliable combat action!

The shotgun comes with 12-ga. smooth bored barrel and the chamber which accepts the ammo equipped with shot or slugs including ""Magnum"" cartridges with 70mm (2-3/4"") and 76 mm (3"") cartridge case.

The shotgun is used to deliver single shots. It is reloaded automatically due to the energy of powder combustion gases bled from the barrel bore through the barrel port. The shotgun may be equipped with a sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation, which makes zeroing and firing at moving targets more convenient. The gas motive unit is adjustable to match the parameters of internal ballistics inherent to the standard cartridges and ""Magnum"" cartridges, as well. For the purpose of diversifying operational capabilities the shotgun may be equipped with muzzle adapters of different chokes."

this gun is in great to excellent condition.  rifleing is great and this shoots straight as can be.  the bluing is awesome for a 60year old plus gun.  i have shot it 40 times since owning it.  action is tight but smooth.  the wood is in great condition.  there are a few nicks but thought it looked better with them and wanted to perserve its history.  i did however put a stain and gunwax to the stock as it was bare wood when i got it.

there is one little spot on the magazine where the bluing is wearing but nothing that would concern anyone.  

the front sight still shows the witness mark for alingment from the original factory.  

this is a natural pointer as long guns go.  it is also one of the lesser made modles of the mosins.  all numbers match.  

this gun also comes with the cleaning rod, clening kit, the correct sling with leather colars, the bolt tool, oil can, a magazine pouch and four 5 round stripper clips.  

i have owned this for about 2 years and have pulled the trigger a total of 40 times and now it just sits in the safe.  when i did shoot it i only used non-corrosive ammo.

290,http://www.armslist.com/posts/370290,For Sale:  Taser International Pink C2 Gold Package,"Puyallup, Seattle, Washington",$ 365,"Listed On: Monday, April 16, 2012",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Taser C2 Pink W/Laser Package Deal! 

The technologically advanced TASER C2 is designed for your personal safety needs. Utilizing the same technology as our proven law enforcement models, it offers incredible take down power and unparalleled protection right in the palm of your hand.

TASER C2 is an Electronic Control Device (ECD) that delivers an incapacitating pulse that overrides the sensory and motor functions of the nervous system. This powerful Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (NMI) technology can stop even the most aggressive individuals, including those under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.

The C2 uses a replaceable cartridge containing inert, compressed nitrogen to fire two small probes that are attached to 15 foot (4.5 meter) insulated conductive wires. Energy is sent over the wires into the probes, which can penetrate up to two cumulative inches of clothing. The charge is transmitted between the two probes, jamming sensory and motor functions, and inhibiting muscular control. This NMI effect continues in 30-second cycles each time you press the trigger. The C2 can also be used as a direct contact stun device.

Advanced Features

•15 ft. (4.5 m) range allows you to stop an attacker before s/he gets to you

•30 second electrical pulse allows you time to safely escape danger or keep an attacker down

•Bold laser sighting system helps you aim confidently and accurately

•Integrated LED light illuminates dark places to improve your line of vision

•Compact, lightweight design allows it to be easily and discreetly carried everywhere you go

•Long-lasting Lithium Power Magazine allows over 50 uses, ensuring you have power when you need it most



Effectiveness

TASER ECDs are the ONLY devices that can consistently incapacitate aggressive, dangerous people. They bring incredible stopping power that has been field-tested by thousands of law enforcement officers around the world. They are safer and more effective than other options, such as sprays or direct contact stuns, that require potentially dangerous chemicals or close range to an attacker and often prove to be ineffective on individuals under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. TASER ECDs allow you to take control of your personal safety.



Easy To Use

Unlike other self-defense options, a TASER C2 can be used and is effective on any area of the body. This is critically important if youre in a highly stressful, dangerous situation that requires you to quickly to defend yourself and/or your loved ones. Its as easy as point and shoot.



Legal To Carry In Most States

TASER devices are not considered firearms by the U.S. Government. They can be legally carried (concealed or open) without permit in 43 states. Use of TASER ECDs is prohibited in DC, HI, MA, MI, NJ, NY, RI, WI and certain other cities and counties. Check local laws before purchasing or carrying ECDs.



Lifetime Replacement Guarantee

Your life is worth more than the cost of a TASER C2!



We at TASER International are 100% committed to protecting life your life. That is why we will replace your TASER C2 free of charge should you ever need to use it to defend yourself. In that event, leave your C2 behind, get to a safe place, and contact police for help. If your C2 is not recovered or is damaged, send a copy of the police report to us, and well send you a new one.



Protecting your LIFE is our PRIORITY.

It is almost not even worth mentioning the fact that it is used because I've only shot about 50-60 rounds through it.  I bought this for long range shooting/hunting and never had time to get out and use it.  It has spent most of its life cleaned and in a rifle case.

This is essentially a Howa 1500 action mounted on a Knoxx recoil reduction stock which reduces 70% of the recoil.  I can tell you for certain that this stock does what it's supposed to.  Also on the few occasions when I managed to shoot it I was able to hit quarter sized targets at 100yds with consistency so I believe there is truth to what people have said about the Howa 1500 being comparable to the Remington 700.

Specs:
24 inch free float heavy barrel
.308 caliber
4+1 round capacity (upgradable to 10 round magazines)
Knoxx recoil reduction 5 position telescopic tactic stock

It takes 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells.  It's 26"" barrels are choked Improved Cylinder (right) and Modified (left).  Duel triggers give instant selection as to which barrel and choke to fire.  
   This makes it perfect for hunting upland game.  Since it takes 3"" shells, it would also be great for hunting ducks/geese.   
   With slugs or buckshot, it could be used for deer/boar (also home defense).  Just shooting clay birds, or thrown targets, would be great fun/practice with this well balanced shotgun.  Very versitile.
   This quality shotgun has a slim wrist pistol grip stock.  Also, the forarm stock isn't overly thick.  This means it can be used by a young, or female shooter also. 
   Light weight at just over 6 1/2 pounds. Easily carried afield all day.  Saftey is mounted on the tang for easy right or left hand use, and goes on safe automatically whenever gun is opened for loading.

 2: Majority of owners are very happy and have little breakage issue.

Not one of the lesser grade 8400's. Immediately upon acquisition, this rifle was shipped directly to Allen Precision Shooting (APS) where ""The Kirby Allen"" personally installed one of his world renouned APS ""Pain Killer"" medium muzzle brakes. He indexed it properly for a right handed shooter. It also is top ported to eliminate muzzle climb. Kirby states that with his brake, the 300 WinMag has comparable recoil to the 243. That's a huge reduction in felt recoil.  It also greatly reduces down range sound. The trigger's action is very smooth and crisp. The rifle also comes with a new bi-pod which is still in it's box.

This was the mainstay battle rifle of the French Army in WW1, since the Lebel rifle was in too short a supply. 

And before you start stupid jokes about only dropped once, this rifle is a depot rebuild, made from at least three separate rifles. Chances are that the guys carrying the originals met with a grisly fate attacking MG nests or holding trenches while being shelled. 

Overall the rifle's probably in 70% shape- it's got uniform old pitting turned to patination, a surprisingly decent bore, and is 100% functional.

Everything works fine, I just never use it and it's taking up space. Cabinet is 4x12, everything original from when I bought it. Has a solid-state clean channel and 2 tube-drive gain channels. The pedal has three buttons; the first changes from the solid state clean channel to either of the two tube-drive gain channels, the next button switches between the two tube-drive gain channels, and the third button turns reverb on and off. I just plugged in my guitar to test it, and it all works as well as it ever did. I paid $850 bucks for this new about 10 years ago, it's sat in a closet for the past 5 years.

I have a Hi-Point 995 Carbine 9mm which is a fun plinker...way better than plinking with a .22lr.  It includes 3 mags (Hi-Point mags are EXPENSIVE) one is brand new costing 25.00. It also comes with BRAND NEW IN THE BOX ATI stock (look them up and see what they cost) to make it look like the Beretta Storm. See pics below of the two rifles together...the one top is the Hi-Point 995 the one on bottom is the Beretta. Really wanting a AR-15 barrel to complete my AR project. Call or text NiNe OnE EiGhT-822-4512 or email. 

P.S. the big pic is what I am offering the little pic is an example of a hi-point with the ATI stock next to a Beretta Storm.
