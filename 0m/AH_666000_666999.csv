Very rare and hard to get Springfield Model. 6"" barrel and slide (1 inch longer than standard 1911 Government model). This gun is a real tack driver at the range. Extra barrel length reduces muzzle flip and still feels like the weight of a standard 5"" 1911. All of the original accessories and paperwork are with the gun and have never been out of the box. I have added Hogue grips and Springfield brand mag well/backstrap. I put the Hogue Grips on the same day I brought it home so the original wood Springfield grips have never been used. Springfield holster, mag carrier and 2 factory mags have never been used.  Original backstrap is bagged and included.
Below is the link to this gun as listed on the Springfield Armory web site. Check it out and you will see that the suggested price is $1,237.00

The world's smallest working revolver. This six shot double action revolver is about the size of a quarter. Made in Austria from 1960 to 1980. It fires 2mm pinfire blanks.

The frame is nickel plated with black plastic grips. The revolving cylinder has six chambers for the 2mm pinfire blanks and an blanked chamber. Always keep the hammer on an empty chamber for safety. Once loaded simply pull the trigger and the hammer cocks then fires, bang, bang, bang. . . just like its bigger counter parts made by Colt, Smith & Wesson, Ruger or Taurus.

When the left grip panel is removed there is a compartment that allows for the attachment of a key chain. Also on the left side of the frame is a screw that when removed allows the attachment of either a mushroom shaped post or a tie bar allowing the revolver to be worn as a cuff link or tie clasp. Each revolver comes in a fitted plastic case with all accessories and instructions.

I have four of these revolvers. A single unit with the cuff link attachment in the round case and a set of three, two round cases with cuff links and one square case with the tie bar. The single unit comes with 6 rounds of blank cartridges and the 3 piece set includes 36 rounds in the original red cartridge box. All four revolvers are in like new unfired condition. Perfect for any gun collector or miniatures collector.

Single unit $185 3 piece set $525

Though not classified as firearms by the BATFE, these are not toy guns. They should be treated with the same respect and eye towards safety one would use with their larger .38 Special, .357 Magnum or 44 Mag brethren."

I'm third owner of this revolver. The one before me never fired it -the original owner was (I was told,) a Florida cop who carried it in an ankle holster for twenty years, and I have fired around thirty rounds through it.

Light weight and short barrel make it easy to carry.
A tribute to attributes. Specialized features are the hallmark of the Compact and Ultra Carry families. All have shorter 3-inch barrels that make them easy to carry with the power of the .45ACP cartridge.
Size matters in a concealed carry pistol. Reduced dimensions and light weight are as important as magazine capacity and power. Kimber Ultra Carry pistols in .45 ACP and 9 mm have it all, and put it together in a 1911 package that simply outperforms any other type of semi-automatic.
To ensure dependability, Ultra Carry lightweight aluminum frames are machined on the same computer-driven machines and to the same unequaled tolerances as Kimber steel frames. Each model has standard Kimber features like rounded and blended edges, beveled magazine well, extended thumb safety and bumped beavertail grip safety. Magazine capacity is 7 rounds in .45 ACP. They fit almost any size hand and point naturally. Best of all, the crisp, clean single action trigger eliminates long travel, heavy pull and the guessing that goes with it. For concealed carry, nothing beats a 1911–and no 1911 beats a Kimber.

I just bought a sub 2000 that also takes Glock magazines so I want to trade this Kel-Tec for a Glock 22, 22c, or 23. I of course would add money to boot based on my price. The other alternative would be to sell it for the price I listed. You can text me. for oh fiv- ate siix tree- for siix tree svn."

It features an innovative hammer and base pin assembly that will not come open during recoil and can be disassembled without tools for quick and easy cleaning and maintenance, even at the range. This revolver has a round barrel, stainless steel frame, 6-shot cylinder, fully adjustable target type sights and 2-piece grips

The Old Army is stainless steel, with fully adjustable target-type sights, and a 7.5"" barrel. 

It was manufactured in 1983, and is in like new condition. I am the second owner and the ROA has been fired only a dozen times in it life. There is little cylinder wear, and almost no marks from the black power. Below is the serial number history link for ROA.

My plans changed. I am going to be available all day Sun. and then Mon & Tues evenings.

If you've been following for the last week you know I'm a hobby dealer selling out. You also know that about 40% of my list is gone. The response has been great, and I've enjoyed meeting those that have purchased.

The updated list has nearly all the items listed at my cost, some below my cost, and none more than $10 over my cost. Many are well below current dealer's cost and some will be below dealer's cost even after tax. They aren't going to get cheaper unless you make an offer for the remaining stock.

Paperwork will be done.
Background calls will be made.
Tax will be charged at 0.0885%.
Even though it's a hobby, it's set up as a legitimate business and all laws and regulations will be met.

I only meet to sell, not to show. Wish I had a storefront to help those still shopping, and I love to visit as much as anybody, but with a full time job I don't have time to meet unless you know what you're looking for.

I won't be answering emails until very late tonight, so don't give up and as I said, I will be available all day Sunday, which will be your best bet to schedule a meeting to purchase. Evenings are tough, as I'm only available after 6:30pm,  and if it's like it was last week, they fill up fast. Meetings should not take more than 15 minutes start to finish.

Thank you.

“The LWRC M6A3 features our midlength short-stroke gas piston system that is the perfect blend of tactical carbine and sniper-capable rifle. The midlength operating system’s softer recoil allows for faster return-to-target and follow-up shots. The M6A3™ rifle features our adjustable gas system. Four positions - (O-Off, S-Suppressed, N-Normal, A-Adverse), which allow for optimum performance in any situation. 

Designed with optics in mind, the M6A3™ rifle is perfectly suited to accept a red dot sight or a high-powered scope. It features an integrated flip-down front sight and patented ARM-R free-float rail system. The easily removable top platform gives quick access to the barrel and piston system and reinstalls in seconds with no tools required. 

The 18” version is our DMR Model (Designated Marksman Rifle). It features all of the features found on the standard M6A3, but it is also equipped with a Geissele two-stage trigger. 

The new M6A3™ rifle is the perfect all-purpose weapon for the modern warfighter or law enforcement professional and civilian.

(I WILL REMOVE THIS AD WHEN IT HAS BEEN SOLD.)





I am looking to sell my CZ-82, it's been a great gun for me, but I'd like to get something along the lines of a full sized handgun.

This is an excellent shooter, DA/SA, amidextrous mag release and safety.12+1 capacity, fires the 9x18 Makarov round. I have fired maybe 300 rounds since I got this gun, and the polygynal rifling, coupled with the fixed barrel makes this gun very accurate, I was easily able to put 12 rounds into a 3 1/2 inch group at 15 yards the first time I shot it. Some wear on the slide, the finish has chipped off, this is very common with these guns as the finish wasn't very good, but gun functions flawlessly, have never had a FTF or FTE.



Whole package includes

-(3) 12 rounds magazines with milled floorplates

-Black leather military surplus holster

-Desantis 106-v5 IWB leather gun holster, for ruger lc9 (also fits CZ-82 as shown nicely, the lip is a bit chewed up, dog got to it, but isn't uncomfortable or noticable when wearing and wears nicely.)

-Military/Police surplus leather shoulder holster, this is very nice and comfortable, it has never ben used, as the leather had yet to be molded to the shape of the gun when I got it, but has some light wear from handling/storage.

-(2) 50 round boxes of Brown bear 94 grain FMJ's

-(1) 50 round box of Prvi Partisan brass cased, reloadable 93 gr FMJ's

- 28 rounds of steel cased russian 9m mak ammo, 92 gr FMJ

-250 rounds of Buffalo Bore 9mm mak +p ammo, these are 115 gr hardcast RN firing at 1000 fps, VERY hot rounds.

-6 Glaser safety slugs

-13 rounds of Hornday XTP hollopoints

The CZ-82 has an upgraded 16lb wolff recoil spring, over the factory 14 pound, helps reduce the already tame recoil.

Comes with upgraded recoil spring, the original recoil spring, and a new firing pin spring as well.

I have fired maybe 300 rounds since I got this gun, and the polygynal rifling, coupled with the fixed barrel makes this gun very accurate, I was easily able to put 12 rounds into a 3 1/2 inch group at 15 yards the first time I shot it. Some wear on the slide, the finish has chipped off, this is very common with these guns as the finish wasn't very good, but gun functions flawlessly, have never had a FTF or FTE.
I'm really leaning towards a new handgun in .45 ACP, so if you have one and would like to trade it, you'll get first priority.


I'd be willing to trade my CZ-82 and everything picture for 500 towards your trade, or can be bought for 450 cash."
