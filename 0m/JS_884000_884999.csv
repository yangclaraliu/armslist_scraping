Among the most unique magazine designs, the 30/45 magazines were designed with an extendable bottom section that would allow the magazine to be fully loaded to 30 rounds and stored (with the base extended) with the spring under minimal pressure. This allowed long-term storage of fully-loaded mags with no wear to the spring or the feed lips. They can also be loaded with 45 rounds when the base extended, though they shouldn't be stored in this configuration.

Among the most unique magazine designs, the 30/45 magazines were designed with an extendable bottom section that would allow the magazine to be fully loaded to 30 rounds and stored (with the base extended) with the spring under minimal pressure. This allowed long-term storage of fully-loaded mags with no wear to the spring or the feed lips. They can also be loaded with 45 rounds when the base extended, though they shouldn't be stored in this configuration.

Among the most unique magazine designs, the 30/45 magazines were designed with an extendable bottom section that would allow the magazine to be fully loaded to 30 rounds and stored (with the base extended) with the spring under minimal pressure. This allowed long-term storage of fully-loaded mags with no wear to the spring or the feed lips. They can also be loaded with 45 rounds when the base extended, though they shouldn't be stored in this configuration.

NY does not support the 2nd Amendment in any way. Please email me with any questions and I am happy to take specific pictures for you. It's the bidder’s responsibility to know whether this firearm is legal in their state. I won't ship to NY, CA, CT or states where this firearm is prohibited by law and no International shipping. The firearm will only be sent to an FFL. Shipping/insurance will be additional but will be at actual cost. I accept cashier's checks, USPS Money Orders, or bank wire transfers. PayPal may be OK if it is VERY discrete. Payment should be made within 7 - 10 days from end of Auction, and no trades as NY state will not allow me to do that.

So far there is no luck finding ammo in Tulsa. Here is 200 rounds. If you dont like the price then dont flag it, You dont have to purchase it. I will only meet in a very public place like QT or parking lot of a sporting good/gun shop. You can text me up to 11pm or email me. I am not interested in trades and no rediculous lowball offers. 

The only place left in Tulsa for 9mm ammo is Dong's and they want 28.00 for 50 rounds. If you meet me in Broken arrow I will offer it for 80.00 or otherwise it is 85.00 for all 200 rounds and I will not piece this up. All or nohting on the 200 rounds"

I bought this years ago, oiled it up, put it away and simply forgot about it. For those who may be interested - Grendel was a hot manufacturer of mostly high capacity weapons in the early 90's. Then came the first assault weapon ban and Grendel silently faded away. However they were resurrected four or five years later as KelTec... same owner, same Florida location. Today KelTec is the third largest manufacturer of handguns in the USA. So if this Grendel resembles a KelTec you've seen that is why. Bottom line is this is a lot of firepower in a very small package. The .380 cartridge is no slouch and many feel that it's about top of the line for a truly concealable pistol. This P12 is much smaller than the compact 9mm's or .40's I've seen. Gun comes in factory plastic case with manual and a spare magazine (mag holds 11 with one in the chamber). Design of this pistol allows it to be carried safely with a chambered round."

Ultra-high capacity magazines keep your rifle running longer between mag changes during competition or tactical operations. These magazines meet NATO STANAG 4179 specifications and are compatible with all rifles that accept AR-15/M16/M4 magazines. Less than two standard magazines wide, so they’re easy to hold and handle with one hand. 60-round model fits most dual-mag pouches for 30-round magazines. Weight is centered under the weapon to help you maintain a normal shooting grip and stance. Seats fully loaded on a closed bolt. “Nesting” nylon followers require no lubrication and fully support the round stack to aid in reliable feeding. Cadmium coating on springs reduces friction and resists corrosion.

This rifle was bought as a complete system fully assembled in the USA by Bushmaster http://www.bushmaster.com/index.asp It is the M4 type carbine with an adjustable telescoping stock. The barrel is 4150 chrome-moly steel w/chrome-lined bore/chamber with a 1/9 twist.

This rifle has been properly broken-in with 200 rounds of Lake City 62 grain FMJ and 150 rounds of Remington ""green box"" 55 grain FMJ. Break-in is very important as it allows the internals and bufferspring to adjust to each other and the rest of the rifle. The rifle was thoroughly cleaned as illustrated by the factory owners manual (included) after break-in.

The carry handle is effortlessly removed and reveals a rail system for the attachment of a red dot or scope. I am currently running a 3x9 tactical scope with illumination (included) attached to a Weaver picatinny rail with the carry handle removed, iron front site causes no interference. The set-up also comes with a picatinny rail carry handle mount for a scope or red dot on top of the carry handle(not pictured), if you prefer to leave it in place.

The pictures show a 40rd metal mag with carry handle in place and 30rd P-mags with the scope mounted. In total there are two 40rd and three 30rd magazines, the 40rd metals have a combination attachment that allows them to bind them together for a total of 80rds attached to this AR!! The set-up will also come with 240rds of Lake City 62grain FMJ, three 20rd boxes of Winchester 55gr, and one box of Remington 55gr for a total of 300 rounds.

If you have been watching the rising price of quality AR's and ammunition then you are aware this is a good/fair deal. That being said the price is firm and all transactions have to be cash. Buyer must present a valid CO ID. The only trade a would consider is a CX4 Storm in 9mm, other than that I am not interested. And ""no"" I don't need any help selling my rifle (local dealers.)

From: Ed Chenel, A police officer in Australia. Why is it we are the only ones who see we are headed.


Hi Yanks, I thought you all would like to see the real figures from Down Under.

It has now been 12 months since gun owners in Australia were forced by a new law to surrender 640,381 personal firearms to be destroyed by our own government, a program costing Australia taxpayers more than $500 million dollars.

The first year results are now in: Australia-wide, homicides are up 6.2 percent, Australia-wide, assaults are up 9.6 percent; Australia-wide, armed robberies are up 44 percent (yes, 44 percent)!

In the state of Victoria lone, homicides with firearms are now up 300 percent.(Note that while the law-abiding citizens turned them in, the criminals did not and criminals still possess their guns!) While figures over the previous 25 years showed a steady decrease in armed robbery with firearms, this has changed drastically upward in the past 12 months, since the criminals now are guaranteed that their prey is unarmed. There has also been a dramatic increase in break-ins and assaults of the elderly, while the resident is at home.

Australian politicians are at a loss to explain how public safety has decreased, after such monumental effort and expense was expended in 'successfully ridding Australian society of guns....' You won't see this on the American evening news or hear your governor or members of the State Assembly disseminating this information.

The Australian experience speaks for itself. Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws affect only the law-abiding citizens.

Take note Americans, before it's too late! Will you be one of the sheep to turn yours in? WHY? You will need it.

FORWARD TO EVERYONE ON YOUR EMAIL LIST. [I DID] DON'T BE A MEMBER OF THE SILENT MAJORITY.

It is chambered in 30 carbine, it appears to be in excellent condition considering its age.
Someone along the way did attach a leather strap, I will leave that up to the new owner as to what to do with it.  It will come with the 30 round mag that you see in the pics, I believe it is one of the Korean mags of recent mfg.  These mags are supposed to be of good quality.  I have never fired this.  This one is made by Plainfield Machine Company, from what little research I did.  I found that these were only made for one year 1976/77 and only 300 +/- were manufactured.  I feel like I have it priced very fair considering current times, and the rarity of this manufacturer.
This is FTF in Indy with a valid IN DL and LTCH  (carry permit) you must be 21yrs. of age.

Product Information
This is a NEW factory original, drop-free magazine for your Glock. Glock magazines have a hardened steel insert encased in high tech polymer. This polymer coating protects the magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from a great height. 

Technical Informaion: 

Glock magazines have very stiff springs when new and may be extremely difficult to load to full capacity. It may be necessary to use a Glock magazine loader (generally included in the Glock case with the handgun) to load the magazine to capacity or near capacity. 

If the last round appears impossible to load, for example if the magazine should hold 15 rounds and it will only accept 14, leave it loaded with 14 rounds for several days to allow the spring's tension to decrease. After a short time, the magazine should then accept its full capacity, but it may still be necessary to use the magazine loader. After several cycles of full capacity through empty, the magazine will be easier to load. 

Glock 34 magazines feature a polymer follower, Glock #SP01812-6

Will also work with Kel-tec 2000 9mm sub rifle

It includes every option you'll need to kit up from a bi-pod and tactical light to a plate carrier (no ESAPI plates) and drag bag, as well as Magazines and ammunition.  This rifle was designed with one of the most highly desired options for the AR-15. By relocating the charging action to the side, as opposed to the rear of the receiver, the shooter can maintain a sight position and shooting position while charging the chamber with ammunition. Additionally, the charging handle on this side charger receiver does not reciprocate with the action of the bolt.  The rifle has less than 500 rounds through it, and shoots its best with black hills 77gr moly, and the custom reloads I am including (the recipe is further down).  This is an opportunity to have a one of a kind precision rifle that routinely shoots minute groups and is a joy to own.

This has been my primary woods/plinker/target gun for the past few years. I'm selling it because I just switched to a revolver. It's a very accurate gun. I have hit pie plates at 100 yards with it. The gun shows some wear. It has a scratch on the outside of the barrel and on the back of the slide. The bore is clean and bright and the gun works very well. Thanks for looking."

There are quite a few proposed regulations right now but not a single one is outlawing ammo! I have sold alot of stuff in my time, and yes, some at a profit. One thing I can say is that I have never tried to rob someone. Here's the problem, for those of you asking $1.00/rd for .223 ammo! You are making everyone looking for it go to the local gun store and pay their inflated price of 50 cent/rd. All you are doing is making the rich folks richer. I'm sorry guys but speculation drives prices for one reason....people like you. Every time you fuss about the price of gas just remember that you are supporting the same principle."
