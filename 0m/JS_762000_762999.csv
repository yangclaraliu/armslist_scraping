I cleaned it thoroughly, lubricated it, put ~35 rounds through it, and cleaned and lubricated it afterwards.  The pictures tell the story of the condition.  The grips are wooden and the 8 round magazine is original and unmodified.

In case you're unfamiliar with the Star B, it was manufactured by Star Bonifacio Echeverria in Spain.  It looks and feels similar to the Browning Model 1911, but is chambered in 9 mm.  It has other differences from the 1911, and parts are not interchangeable.  The parent design for this gun is the Star Model A, which is chambered for 9X23 mm Largo.  When Star modified the Model A to fire the 9 mm Luger cartridge, they initially installed internal spacer blocks in the rear portion of the magazines to prevent a sloppy fit of the shorter 9x19 catridges.  They made changes to the Model B during WWII, and one of them was to abandon production of these costlier magazines.  The magazine with this pistol is this unmodified type.  Some Star B owners install an internal spacer in the magazine to eliminate the sloppy fit of the cartridges and improve reliability.  I have not shot it enough to warrant the time and effort to do this.

Please hold any further inquiries.) 
I hate to let this go, because at the very least, the further importation of these is extremely likely to be halted soon, causing values to skyrocket and availability to plummet.
That being said, I'm selling one of my very favorite toys, my Lancaster-built AK-47. This is a Romanian AK, but it's not a cheap,lowly WASR, these are built on American receivers w/ G2 trigger group, from the Romanian ""G Models"" ( G stands for 'Guardia' and were their genuine military issue rifles.) I am the original owner of this rifle, purchasing it new about 8 years ago, directly from Lancaster Arms in Arizona ( and shipped here to Columbus.)
At the time, Lancaster was very highly regarded by AK afficianados, but as order volume increased, their ability to maintain the same quality began to suffer after a few years, as did their reputation.
But the older Lancasters are still widely considered excellent rifles, as this one definitely is.
One of their cool production trademarks was that they Parkerized the bare metal, and then used that as a base for the Gun-Kote baked-on epoxy finish, that looks great and is completely corrosion resistant.
The rifle has only been fired a few times, and is in pristine condition. The chrome bore is clean and crisp. The front sights and gas tube are perfectly straight, and the rivet heads are perfectly formed, and magazines fit firmly ( like I said, it ain't a WASR).
I installed an ERGO-Grip myself, as they are much more comfortable and ergonomic that those cheesy,stock AK grips.  I also installed the larger, Bulgarian flash-hider seen in the pics. The rifle has both the cleaning rod and cleaning kit concealed in the butt-stock.
Included is the green-web AK sling,and three,30-round magazines, including the vintage Russian (Tula) Bake-Lite magazine seen in the photos ( these are expensive, difficult to find collector items on their own). The other mags are a standard east-block steel mag, and a polymer Tapco.
Also inlcuded are 5 boxes of Wolf ammo.
I haven't decided if I'm taking this to the Eastmann gunshow this weekend,I may be there.
This is for sale to Georgia Residents with valid drivers license (I'll sell to Ala. residents, but that will require an FFL transfer in Phenix City.)
Asking $1200,firm, and from what I'm currently seeing of the AK market, this quite reasonable for a rifle of this quality ( the big local gunstore  {you know who I mean} has only 2 AK's in stock, both used Romanians, and asking $1100 plus tax, and NO cool upgrades,ammo or accessories.)"

I have 2000 rounds of Lake City Ammunition for sale and will ship at the buyer's expense.

$650/1000 or will split for $.75/round

This hard to find 5.56x45mm XM855 ammunition is perfect for your 5.56 chambered AR-15 and it is manufactured at the famed Lake City Army Ammunition Plant (LCAAP). This ammo is rugged and reliable having been produced on the same production line that produces ammunition for our U.S. military!

This XM855 ammunition is also commonly known as ""green tip"" or ""penetrator"" ammo for the steel tip located at the front of the bullet. These ""green tip"" bullets are copper jacketed, lead core, with a steel tip at the front of the bullet.

Lake City is currently operated under contract by ATK (parent company of Federal, CCI, and Speer) who is allowed to sell excess production to the civilian market. 

This ammunition which is manufactured on the same production line that as the U.S. military's has a few differences than commercially manufactured 223 ammo. First, this ammo has both a primer sealant and a case/mouth sealant designed to help prevent moisture intrusion helping your ammo to last longer. Second, this ammunition must have the annealing marks left around the neck of the cartridge case. Brass cases are formed from a flat sheet of metal and are made through the cup and draw process. With each drawing step that the brass undergoes it becomes brittle and must be heat treated for it to become workable again for the next draw. After the last draw the brass runs across a series of flames aimed at the neck of the case to make the metal malleable. Evidence of this final annealing step at Lake City must be left on the cases so that military inspectors can verify that the cases have been properly annealed. So, the discoloration on the cases is simply a cosmetic appearance and is actually a sign that this final quality step was performed. In fact, Lake City brass is considered by many reloading experts to be the best brass in the world for reloading 5.56 ammo.

This ammo is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, and reloadable. For quality 5.56 ammo, it doesn't get any better than Lake City production!"

I have removed the big square briefcase handle from the top, it looks much better without it and dropped a little weight as well.

This is NOT a parts kit, hobby build, or mix and match upper/lower.  This is a combat ready, rock solid, high-end, factory, complete AR-15.  
Features:

16"" 5.56 1:7 twist barrel
LMT 2 stage national match trigger
LMT SOPMOD stock
Ambi Safety
LMT Ergo Pistol Grip
Semi-auto bolt carrier group and charging handle
Standard mil-spec buffer

You'll have a hard time finding a new LMT for this price!  $2200 is how much people are asking for DPMS's, Bushmasters, and other inexpensive rifle brands.  If the ban goes through, don't get stuck with a subpar brand.  

I did not plan on selling this rifle, therefore, there is no box or LMT paperwork.  Also, the dealer did not have the rear sight assembly, but I had planned on putting a rail and back up iron sights on it so I didn't need a bulky fixed rear sight.   

Face to face purchase only.  Cash only.  No trades.  Must have current valid Ohio drivers license and preferably a CCW license also.  You must be able to legally purchase a firearm.  I have a bill of sale prepared for both parties.  

I will reply to emails in the same order in which they are received. 

$2200 or best offer.  All reasonable, serious, offers will be considered.  Email for other photos.

 SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, and is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest.

These are still available commercially, but here's a relatively rare one. While they are now well over the 20,000-range in serial numbers, this one is in the #3800 range - a four-digit number and a very desirable piece. Also, these early ones had a much more subdued blade signatures that made for a more professional looking package. Has the original nylon sheath with black leather strap. The edge is perfect; backing material makes it look almost serrated in an area or two. It's not. 

Like new.

Here's some text from current ads . . .
Boker's reissue of the Applegate-Fairbairn Fighting Knife uses fiberglass-reinforced Delrin handle, thickened in the center for a sure grip. A lanyard hole adds convenience. The handle meets a short, forward-bending cross guard that protects the fingers. Boker achieved the knife's preferred rearward balance by inserting steel weights into the handle - a beautifully ergonomic design. The 6"" blade on this 10 3/4"" knife has effective reach, with a 1"" wide blade that's beefy all the way to the tip. Struck of Solingen 440C stainless steel hardened to a Rockwell of 58, the blade has the signatures of Rex Applegate and W.E. Fairbairn etched into the bead-blasted finish. Made in Solingen, Germany."

Chambered in 357 magnum/38 special. When I talked to a S&W Rep. on the phone for a replacement key (for the internal lock) he had said that the serial number would date the production to December of 2008. As for the gun, the only thing that has been done to it was installing a Hogue monogrip. I have only put about 25 rounds of 357 and 30 rounds of 38 through it. Thoroughly cleaned after shooting. Fixed front sight (removable, but not adjustable) and notched rear sight. It is extremely accurate, and would easily hit a quarter size bulls-eye at 10+ yards. The trigger is smooth with a 2.5lb SA and 9lb DA trigger pull. Comes with the gun, a pistol sock, and the key.

For the right deal, I also have some accessories. I have two Quickstrips, two Safariland speedloaders, a Crossbreed Supertuck IWB holster, a smaller fabric IWB/Pocket holster, a kydex trigger guard used for waistband carry without a holster, and some defense ammo. 

I would much rather trade since some people are asking outrageous prices for their firearms up here on Armslist, and Gander Mtn. and other stores are picked over. Please do not contact me with lowball offers. Like I said before, I am more interested in trading for specific firearms and am not in a rush to get rid of it.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

................................................................................................

after you've done that simply enter in you're information at the bottom and make sure everything is filled out. after double checking that all information has been correctly filled out click ""send message"" at the bottom of the screen. this will send you're letter to the offices of president obama and ALL of you're state representitives urging them to oppose any and all gun control legislation.
please don't wait to do this if you don't stand up now we all fall. even if you're not a gun owner you should oppose any legislation that removes any civil rights of american citizens. this time it may be gun rights but next time it could be you're right to speak freely or you're right to worship the religion of you're choice or you're right to??? civil rights are ALL sacred and if you 
oppose removing the rights of the people please go to the link provided and stand up for america......NOW!!! words cannot discribe how important this is."

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

................................................................................................

after you've done that simply enter in you're information at the bottom and make sure everything is filled out. after double checking that all information has been correctly filled out click ""send message"" at the bottom of the screen. this will send you're letter to the offices of president obama and ALL of you're state representitives urging them to oppose any and all gun control legislation.
please don't wait to do this if you don't stand up now we all fall. even if you're not a gun owner you should oppose any legislation that removes any civil rights of american citizens. this time it may be gun rights but next time it could be you're right to speak freely or you're right to worship the religion of you're choice or you're right to??? civil rights are ALL sacred and if you 
oppose removing the rights of the people please go to the link provided and stand up for america......NOW!!! words cannot describe how important this is."

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Large drop first ""payment sent"" takes it.

I am selling LWRC AR chambered in 6.8 spc.  

If you are not familiar with the ammunition do a simple Google search. The ammunition was developed by Remmington and USSOCOM to address 5.56mm deficiencies and potentially replace it. It is midway between the 5.56×45mm NATO and 7.62×51mm NATO in bore diameter and velocity (Wikipedia) 6.8 special boasts up to 40-50% more kinetic energy than the 5.56 and in terms of weight only about 30% heavier so you can carry “more bang for your buck”.

The lower has not been fired.  It is a LWRC stripped lower marked 6.8 spc with a Stags Lower Parts Kit (LPK) installed.  The complete lower also includes a Colt Safety, Magpul MOE grip,  Commercial size receiver extension, Heavy Buffer, LWRCs new trigger guard, Snake Skin Panels, and Magpul MOE stock.

The upper only has 600 rounds through it.  The barrel is 14.5” stainless Lother Walther barrel that’s ceracoated black.   It has a 1:10 twist rate, with a pinned and welded Phantom flash suppressor (this was all factory work at LWRC, when they offered this model).  Also included is a LWRC Nickle-Teflon bolt carrier and 6.8 CMT bolt and Standard Charging handle.  There is no rear sight, but there is a GG&G triple clamped flip up front sight gas block (used only as a front sight, not a gas block).

Your FFL must be able to accept from an individual. Money Order is preferred form of payment.  If you need to do Paypal please add +4% and be discreet.  Please note that firearm is not in my possession. I have paid for this weapon and decided to resell. The shipper is an employee of an LWRC distributor. This weapon was part of his personal collection.

While the upper has a relatively low round count considering its age, it has been used as a display upper since '07. So there are visible handling marks, most notable around to forward section of the rail (these should be visible in the photos). The lower looks quite new. 

The gun will come with one used PRI mag (pictured), one new in bag PRI 25rd mag and two new C Product mags. The used steel PRI mags have had surface rust, which have been cleaned off. There gun is completely functional and in good shape.

This weapon new would be $2000-$2200NIB before the gun scare AR-15 craze. This firearm is selling at better value than other low end to entry level ARs that are selling for TWICE as much as they were before. The mark up is minimal or virtually nonexistent as LWRCs are the best gas-piston ARs on the market.
6.8SPC is easier to find than MARKED UP 5.56/.223.  5.56 is selling for about (70cents/round) 6.8 (.80cents/round)

...............................................................................................
Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

................................................................................................

after you've done that simply enter in you're information at the bottom and make sure everything is filled out. after double checking that all information has been correctly filled out click ""send message"" at the bottom of the screen. this will send you're letter to the offices of president obama and ALL of you're state representitives urging them to oppose any and all gun control legislation.
please don't wait to do this if you don't stand up now we all fall. even if you're not a gun owner you should oppose any legislation that removes any civil rights of american citizens. this time it may be gun rights but next time it could be you're right to speak freely or you're right to worship the religion of you're choice or you're right to??? civil rights are ALL sacred and if you 
oppose removing the rights of the people please go to the link provided and stand up for america......NOW!!! words cannot describe how important this is."
