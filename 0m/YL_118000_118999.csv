Very cool, real machined metal (I believe hardened steel just like an ASP baton) EXPANDING NUNCHUKS. These are a solid impact weapon not fakes or foam trainers. IT IS SOLID AND WELL MADE. Expanding baton sections are connected by a heavy chromed chain. When retracted the entire set fits into a belt pouch that isn't much bigger than a large folding knife sheath. I have trained with numerous weapons and firearms, but this isn't something practical for me. Just a very cool item that someone into martial arts may want. Unknown make or vitage, but I can tell that this is a solid quality item that should not be considered a toy. Open to reasonable offers or trades for gun gear. $30 includes standard shipping.

*The nunchaku is a weapon used in Okinawan Kobudo. Under Japanese rule in the early 17th century the people of Okinawa were not allowed to own weapons. In response, the people learned empty fist fighting and created weapons out of household implements. Fighting arts revolving around a staff (bo), the handle of a millstone (tonfa), a sickle (kama) developed. The bit used for horses was two sticks tied together with a string. That simple device became the weapon we now call nunchucks. *"

Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights.""

I have two of them.  Ordered a 9mm the second time but they shipped me a .45 again.  Not my fault but they said no return on firearms. Just to tell you why I'm getting rid of one. lol. Both have about 250 rounds through the pipe(shooting with a friend) and comes with everything that come with them originally.  Haven't failed on me yet. I also have an extra mag. Very minimum recoil and ""lifetime no question ask warranty"", original owner or not.  Call them to check if you want. Let me know. Thanks.

Note: They do sell more than the manufacturer's suggested retail price. Anywhere from $220 to $250 here in the seattle-tacoma area. They're cheaper online but you still have to pay around $50 to $75 to a local licensed dealer for shippement and delivery.  You probably know how it works.  Just a FYI. Call or text if interested.

315,http://www.armslist.com/posts/118315,For Sale:  Custom Made Concealed Carry Holsters,"Maumelle/Conway, Little Rock, Arkansas",$ 50,"Listed On: Thursday, March 31, 2011",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hand made in Arkansas. I custom make these Holsters one at a time building them just the way you want them. My holsters are designed to be worn around the 4 o'clock position for optimum comfort. I make them in black cowhide. and in natural horsehide which is a light tan. I use metal clips and can add belt slots to the holster so you can remove the clips and wear on your belt owb. I have 6 holes in the leather for you to move the clips up or down to adjust the cant and ride height of your weapon.
If you have any other Questions feel free to email me at REDACTED and I will get back with you as quickly as possible.You won't here from a secretary or a receptionist, because I don't have one. I believe you need to hear from the man that will be building your holster.
In most cases I can get your holster to you in a week to 10 days. These holsters are Kydex with 8-9oz Premium Leather or Horsehide backing. Extremely comfortable for all day wear. All holsters come with 100% satisfaction guarantee. Lifetime warranty.

Cowhide is only $50.00 Shipped.
Horsehide is only $60.00 Shipped.
Wear it 2weeks if you don't like it, return it for a full refund!

The advantages of a horsehide holster.
1.They are stronger, yet thinner than
cowhide, making them easier to conceal.

2. Horsehide does not absorb sweat like
cowhide, because it is more dense and
much more durable than cowhide.

3. The horsehide I use is 100% natural
with no color or dyes to stain your
clothing.

4. When you first receive your horsehide
holster it will seem a little stiff, with daily
wear it will form to your body and become
very comfortable, but it will not be as soft as
cowhide.

Purchased this great little gun about a year ago. I have only put about 150 rounds through it. I really bought it for my wife because she can operate the slide on it with no problems. Well she isn't shooting all I used it for was Conceal Carry. 
I purchased another gun and was informed something must go so I chose this gun.

I'm looking to trade for a ruger New Vaquero with a 4 3/4'' barrel, preferably stainless steel, but I'll look at all offers. In either .45 LC or .357, kinda leanin towards the .45LC. But its got to come with a good supply of ammo(2-300 +)

My package includes
- RIA 1911 w/hogue grips (original grips and pistol case included)
- 6 8rd magazines (2 kimber ss, 2 Cproducts ss, 2 ACT mags)
- 750rds brass cased 230gr FMJ ammo (500 S&B, 250 Blazer)
- SASS style leather belt(size 36), holster, and double mag pouch made by el passo saddlery

My 1911 is used, but well maintained, with relatively low round count. It's a shooter, not a safe queen. I know the value of these pistols is low, but there's 120 in the mags, 140 in the holster rig, and 750rds of ammo with it. 
I think an even trade for a revolver with a few hundred rounds of ammo is more than fair. Will only consider substantial cash offers, I'm more interested in trading than selling. 

Thanks."

The x-change kit is a complete subcompact .357 Sig kit, 2nd generation (newest).  It includes the small grip shell, a Nitron finished slide with Siglite night sights, barrel, guiderod, spring, one magazine and a hard plastic carry case.  The barrel has had fewer than 200 rounds fired through it, the rest of the parts on the kit have only had 50 rounds used in them for test purposes, since I was putting this .357 barrel into another kit I own that shoots .40 and holding the other parts as spare parts if ever needed.

Along with this are 300 factory loaded rounds of .357 Sig target ammo and 30 rounds of Speer Gold-Dot personal protection ammo.

For anyone who owns a P250 compact or full-size pistol, you already know this is a modular pistol and you can change kits quickly.  This .357 Sig kit and ammo are a great personal defense set-up--I just don't need two.

$325 for anyone who wants to meet locally - add actual cost of shipping if not local. These items can ship direct to you without needing to go through an FFL since there are no serialized parts - the serial number for a P250 is on the fire control unit.

The kit will look like the picture posted, just without the fire control unit and slide-release bolt, which are part of an original P250 pistol and not in a kit."

    I am looking for something new, however due to ""the Economy""...I must trade instead of purchase (sad right)..so anyway..
I offer up for trade a beautiful Kahr CW9. The pistol was purchased new by me about 6 mos ago with the intent to carry...but no matter what I buy I obviously cant bring myself to carry anything but my J frames. The Kahr is flawless, new model slide with dovetail rear sight cut, upgrade to metal mag release and solid metal guide rod, full mirror polished treatment on the feed ramp, chamber, and internals (done by gunsmith at the range it was purchased from). The pistol has only had 50 Flawless rounds thru it, and I could lie and say it hasn't been fired, it's that clean. Super smooth trigger, super smooth shooter, but otherwise would just sit in my safe. I also purchased an additional magazine (extended 8rd). Will come in box with paperwork and the 2 mags

I am looking for trades FTF in N.E. Ohio right now...ONLY....

I have a buddy who has this model and carries it every day.  He has an inexpensive in-the-waistband Desanti leather holster he got off of Midway for $15 that he explains is very comfortable.  He also simply pocket carries when the occasion presents itself.  He had a single stack, slim 9mm (Ruger LC9, Kahr PM9, Keltec PF9) and actually prefers the snub-nosed 38 over those slim 9mm's.  You know when you pull the trigger on a loaded Smith and Wesson revolver, it goes boom.  Very simple use, point and pull, which makes it an ideal handgun for inexperienced shooters.

UPDATE:  This same buddy of mine has given me a Blackhawk CQC Holster to sell along with this 442.  He thought out-of-the-waistband was going to be even more comfortable than the Desanti but decided to stick with in-the-waistband.  So, a new, unfired Smith and Wesson 442 with Blackhawk holster for $400"

In overall very good condition. I traded this off a few months ago, and it just isn't my thing. 

The previous owner had taken off some of the finish under the trigger assy. and rear of the reciever during the conversion, I tried to touch it up with a black finish pen, doesn't look perfect but it worked. The folding stock also seems to interfere with the charging handle somewhat, but locks out tight. I've never tried firing it folded, but I imagine it wouldn't work the best.

I also have a first year (1922) Marlin Model 39 with star symbol after model, and s after serial, it is the most premium one made, and at 80% is worth 2500, it has octagon barrel and is 22lr.  I will take much much less for this gun, or a real strong trade. REDACTED"

This is the a Smith & Wesson AR15 from the M&P family of rifles.  Since this is a S&W rifle, you know that the quality is top notch.  The rifle is modeled after the Colt M4 style of AR15.  This rifle has less than 200 rounds of non-corrosive ammo down the barrel.  The upper is chambered in the Russian 5.45x39mm round, which has very similar ballistics as the 5.56 NATO round.  The benefit of the 5.45x39mm is that you can buy surplus ammo dirt cheap.  You can find 1080 round spam cans of Russian surplus for $140 on the Internet such as AIMSurplus.  If you plan to do a lot of shooting, then this is the gun for you.  The barrel has a chome chamber and bore to allow for shooting of corrosive ammo.  This gun comes with original box, hard case, manuals, silent sling, forward verticle grip and 4 5.45x39mm 30rd C-Products magazines.  Optic pictured is not included with this package.  This package is for $850 cash, and please no trades.  Buyer must travel to OKC area for a face to face transaction.  Thanks for looking at this ad."

Quality Hardware and Machine Corporation SN 4814957, with an Underwood Barrel dated 1-44. Type I carbine, (no bayonet lug, flip rear sight) with everything looking 'right' on it. There are no re-import marks on this one at all. This one was in our hands going to and coming home from the war.

The Receiver is a Type IB, with the detachable operating spring housing ('Q' marked) & a through-drilled operating slide stop hole. The rear sight is marked 'B-Q' and is well-staked on both sides of the pin that the sight pivots on. 

The barrel is an Underwood Type I dated 1-44 and has a long skirt; it has the large 'flaming bomb' ordnance mark, and has a strong 'P' proof mark about 6"" from the muzzle. The crown is the original rounded one, and is in good shape, as is the rifling. Bore is shiny, with no visible pitting or damage to my eye.

Bolt is an 'EM-Q' marked type III with a type III firing pin, extractor, and extractor plunger (by serial number range...I can't find my bolt tool to disassemble it). The operating slide is a type IV, marked 'UN-Q' with an '11' stamped on it near the manufacturer mark.

The trigger housing is pretty neat; it is the Type IV style, which was developed by Underwood and made out of sheet steel, which was stamped out, then brazed together, then milled out and various other pieces (trigger guard, etc.) were welded to it to complete it. 'Q-TX' marks it, and it has a type II trigger ('LT-Q'), type II sear ('GE-Q'), type III hammer ('LT-Q'), type III safety (unmarked push button style), and a type IIA magazine catch marked 'EP-Q'. I verified that it is a type IIA by checking the rails; they are 0.10"" wide and have no play in the housing (its not a modified Type III with the markings ground off; they have a rail that is 0.070"" thick and wobble in the housing)

The stock is a type II, with an oval cut for the oiler. It is a high-wood stock with VERY nice grain around the op handle, but it has a few dings (who wouldn't after being around 67 years?) and it appears that someone marked it with an 'M' or 'W' right behind the recoil plate screw. The 1/2"" ordnance cartouche is very clear, about an inch in front of the oiler cutout. The sling is not correct for the gun; its a standard GI-style loop sling, with the hook cut down to fit in the narrower Type IB sling swivel slot.

It will come with 1 Type I 15 round magazine, stamped 'IA'. Magazine is in good shape, for a WWII veteran. Bluing looks good.

I had two gunsmiths look at it, and they both said that the metal was between 95 and 98%, with the bluing wear on the bolt being the biggest issue. They also said it was great wood, but the dings and 'M' ('W'?) hurt it a little; they put the wood at 90 to 95%. At 98%, a Quality HMC carbine with no re-import marks Blue Books at $1675. 95% brings $1250.

This is a 95% gun. The only things that hurt it, in my opinion, is the 'M' carved in the stock (only because I don't know the source...if it was documented to be an initial of a soldier that carried it...wow.) and the sling. The bluing wear on the bolt is nothing unusual, and I'd even say it isn't excessive for its age. I'm asking $1200 for this one. No trades at this time, unless you've got a decent AR (no frankenguns, please) you'd be willing to part with. Cheap ARs and $$$ would be considered.  I'd prefer FTF in the Greensboro, NC area, but can ship on your dime.  I'd have to get your location to work up S&H.

Email me with any questions. I've got tons of pics from the teardown to send if you're interested, and I'll get back to you ASAP."
