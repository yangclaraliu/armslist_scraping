Up for your consideration is a 1939 ASFA ANKARA Turkish Mauser chambered in 8MM. Overall average good condition for a Turkish Mauser. Rifle has aged patina but that is normal. Rifle has been thoroughly cleaned. I personally have only shot around 80-100  rounds through it. The end of the barrel is stamped ""8mm West Germany"" because if i recall the Turks bought these from the Germans in the mid 1930's. Has leather sling. Appears to be all original. Good shooting rifle. Chambers and ejects cartridges like it should. Includes a camo/brown soft case with large outer zipper pocket. Price to sell at $175.00 cash and carry. I am selling this because i have a balance of $175.00 on a rifle in layaway i would like to get out sometime soon. I am located in Walled Lake near west of 15mile/Haggerty rd.

this receiver was bought before cuomo made the stupid laws.  as a result you can build it anyway you want based on the new law.

i AM leagally able to transfer it as a private person to a private person until march of 2013!  an ffl is NOT able to sell you one already.....so if you want an AR and build it with evil features than this is your chance ( you will have to register it in 2014 though!)

asking $599.  ftf is okay.   you MUST bring a NYS drivers license and sign a paper saying you can legally own a firearm.  cash only.  no ytrades.

Based on a long lineage of straight pull bolt action rifles, beginning with the Schmidt-Rubin Model 1889. Rubin designed the bullet that was combined with Schmidt's straight pull bolt rifle.  

A very accurate, detachable magazine fed rifle with a very unique straight pull bolt that allowed the soldier to quickly chamber rounds by pulling straight back on the bolt and then slamming it forward. Very revolutionary engineering in a battle rifle for the late 1800's. Because of the straight pull bolt technology the Swiss soldier did not have to raise up (exposing themselves to enemy fire) and chamber a round, like a standard turn-bolt rifle. 
this rifle is the most accurate surplus rifle i have shot.
it is in excellent shape, it has the typical scratches and dings in the stock you see in these rifles.
the bluing is in excellent shape also.
bore is mirror and crown is excellent.
if you want one of the most accurate surplus rifles there is,the swiss engineering of these rifles are amazing.

 USP's are smaller and lighter than the larger frame USP - SCOM. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP uses a full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
 Like their large frame predecessors, USP's are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P+ loads full time .
 Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.
 Features & System Characteristics:
 Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
 Grooved target triggers
 Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life. 200,000 rounds design tested.

Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide
 One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
 No snag, bobbed hammer
 Flared recurve trigger guard
 Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines
 Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
 Ambidextrous magazine release lever
 Contoured, extended slide release
 Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator

A 3x9 scope(not an expensive one, but a good, sturdy one)
An interchangeable barrel in .222 Remington (what the .223 was based on. A sum up of it is it shoots a bit further, and flatter than the .223, but it doesn't tumble on impact.)
2 .222 five round mags.
Seven boxes of .222 ammo.
And a laser bore sight for .223.

It also fires milsurp 5.56 quite well, and prefers the 55gr rounds as opposed to heavier.

All you need for swapping the barrels is a vice and a wrench, and somewhere around 15 minutes work to realign. Not hard, but not an on the fly thing.

I want to trade for a similar type rifle. such as an M4. I just want something different but don't want to loose this style of rifle with all that's going on. Also 30 round mag is NOT included...

I have not fired this rifle myself. But it cycles rounds just fine. 
With a 30rd mag it is loose, not sure why, it's not the mag. 5rd mags are fine. 
If it is a problem send it to Ruger for free and they will fix it. Don't use that as a negotiation angle because it costs nothing to get it fixed (if it is even a problem)

Mother Russia's most historically proven early battle rifle and our most popular selling rifle by far. And why not, these fine rifles have been meticulously refinished in Russian arsenals before release for export and they look great. Not only are they 100% functional, but they have a reputation for being reliable, hard hitting, and extremely accurate. The 7.62x54r round was the Warsaw Pact heavy caliber from the early 20's until modern day, so surplus ammunition is very plentiful and extremely affordable. This renown cartridge is more powerful than a .308 and ballistically rivals our 30/06 caliber. This round is more than adequate for harvesting any Big Game animal in North America. Without a doubt the Mosin Nagant M91/30 provides by far the most bang for the buck of any rifle on the market today. Here you have a rifle capable of taking any big game in North America at respectable yardage, fires affordable ammo, and can be obtained for less that the price of a high end pellet rifle. Importer stamp is small on the right side of the barrel C.A.I ST. ALB. VT. (Century Arms International of St Albans, VT.)

The price includes shipping/handling. If paying by credit card add 3% to the selling price. Missouri residents must pay 6.225% state sales taxes.

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.

Colt's M4 Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. 

• Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components 
• Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm) 
•Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
• 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
• Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
• Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
• Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
• Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
• Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
• M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
• Two 20RND mags
• Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
•High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness.

Bought it very recently. Wanted it as a hunting rifle. After much debate I think it's a great rifle but not my cup of tea. I paid $1390 for it plus $50 shipping so I'm selling it for $1440 which is exactly what I've invested - and I'll gladly prove that to you. Please do not ask me what my bottom dollar is or if I'll take blah for it. Local deal preferred. An FFL will need to be involved in the transaction even if you are local.

A like-new iPad 3, 64GB, 4G / LTE (preferably AT&T, but not absolute), would at least like original box/packaging, etc.

Here's what I have that I'm willing to trade:
RUGER 10/22, black synthetic stock, excellent condition, 2x 25-round Ruger BX25 magazines and original 10-round. I am the original owner and have put around 200-300 rounds through it. It's a great little gun, but I have another 22LR S/A rifle so it gets no use.

RUGER 22/45 Mark III Target pistol. LNIB, with case and all original paperwork / documentation. It has two factory 10-round mags. I've put fewer than 10 magazines through it.

AMMO:  I have .223 / 5.56 *brass-cased* ammo (mostly Federal M855 and M193), 7.62x39 Wolf ""Polyformance"" 123-grain in 20-pack boxes, and I also have some .40 S&W and .45 ACP handgun ammo.

The above iPad I desire is readily available on eBay for somewhere in the $500 range depending upon auction, so if you want 5.56 ammo I'll go up-to 500 rounds. I'll do 1,000 rounds of 7.62. If you want either of the guns, we can adjust the ammo quantity accordingly."

We agreed on a price and agreed that first thing Monday morning I would send him a usps money order for the price plus shipping.  I followed through this morning.  While at the post office I texted him a pic of the usps money order and a photo of my food along with return address.

I realized that I had nit gotten his full name which is needed for the money order.  He then sent me a different name.  Then I realized that even though he had told me he lived in matteson illinois, he wanted me to send the money order to richton park.

When I then asked him to send me a photo I.d. he told me that it would violate his security clearence.  

This all seems too fishy to me.  He is also selling a serpa holster as well.

Bipod stud mounted in quad rail. Folding forward pistol grip with storage compartment. Bayonet lug. Flip up night sights present, but no glow left in tritium tubes. A new Israeli extractor and extractor spring were installed after purchase. The serial number starts with GAL and the ejector lug and receiver looks great. There have been between 350 and 500 rounds fired through the rifle since I purchased it new. Bore is in fantastic shape. Shoots brass or steel case ammo.
This rifle is a combination of an AR-15 and an AK-47. The receiver is milled and the folding stock is very solid and locks up tight, made from steel tubing and a cast aluminum butt section. This rifle has a chromed gas piston and a right side charging handle, that can be charged with the left hand also as it is vertically oriented. The rifle is much more accurate than the typical AK-47 type design. Chrome lined barrel. The front sight hood is a full circle, so it is easy to line up with the ar style flip 2 size peep rear sights. There are flip up night sights but the tritium does not glow, the night sights can be replaced by new mepro sights from Optics Planet for about $80.
The magazines are all in very good shape and are metal, not plastic. There are (12) 35 round magazines. There are (5) 12 round magazines-purchased new (unused).

This is one of the finest replicas weighing and looking exactly like the original gun that was the father of all military assault rifles.  This rifle comes packed in a ""period"" styled wooden box, complete with markings that make it feel like you've pulled the box from some historical shelves in an old factory (see photos below).  I am also including five (5) - 25-Rd Magazines.  As indicated, it was never fired and I was keeping it as a collector's item.

RIFLE FACTS:  German Sports Guns (GSG) is in the process of releasing several exact (.22 cal firing) replicas of original (famous) WW II German Guns.  Their standards are to make the guns weigh exactly the same and look exactly the same as the originals - with no cheap shortcuts.  This STG-44 Sturmgewehr is made of solid metal and wood (weighs 10 Lbs as the original).  Even the magazines (although a plastic material) feel like metal.  Everything about this rifle smacks of originality - and wait till you hold it in your hands.  The rifle breaks down for easy cleaning (not like some .22's where you can't even take out the bolt).  Everything breaks down quickly and the bolt can be quickly removed for a thorough cleaning.  This rifle is in demand - but the few that do arrive at gun stores are quickly nabbed up, thus it's becoming an increasingly hard model to get a hold of.  YOU MUST SEE THIS RIFLE TO APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY, SOLIDITY, AND BUILD QUALITY OF THIS AWESOME REPLICA.

REASON FOR SELLING:  I'm a retired Marine and my father originally served as a German Army Officer during WW II (yes, we emigrated to the US).  Because he had often mentioned that at the end of the war he had a Sturmgewehr and loved its reliability and firepower, I've since wanted one.  When the GSG version became available, I immediately purchased two (I was very lucky).  But as the word got out, they became more difficult to acquire due to their exceptional build quality.  I'm now selling off one because having two doesn't do me any good.  I am selling this gun and magazines basically for the price I paid for everything shown.  I don't believe in gouging just because guns are in demand now-a-days. 

PRICE:  $775 Cash (Please - no checks or trades).  I prefer a local sale due to convenience, but will sell out of state - however.....out-of-state buyers will have to pay for shipping and insurance to the FFL location up front.  Local sales will require a formal bill of sale be made out, along with copies being made of your drivers license.

It is a PSA Lower with a Rock River 2 stage match trigger and Magpul PRS Stock which is adjustable for cheekweld and length of pull.  

The upper receiver is a slick side, and fits VERY tightly to the lower.  There is no wobble of any kind.  The barrel is a Krieger stainless, 1:8 twist, 22"" full profile bull barrel, threaded a 5/8-24 pitch with a Miculek Compensator.  The upper has a flat top picatinny gas block, rifle length MW quad rail and Harris bi-pod, and badger ordnance charging handle with the big tac latch.  

The scope is a 30mm BSA Tactical Mildot 6-24 X 44 with Side Parallax Adjustment mounted in a Burris PEPR.  It also has a fastfire style UAG Reddot mounted forward on a 1 o'clock mount...in case your shooting bench gets overrun and you need to go CQ.  There is a Viking Tactics padded sling with QD mounts on it as well.

Included are two 25 rnd mags a and 10 rnd mag, as well as a new set of Hornady Custom Dies, RCBS shell holder, 100 Hornady AMAX bullets, and about 60 pieces of hornady brass.  I also have about 80 rounds of Horndady AMAX ammo too.  

This gun is a tack driver.  I waited months and months on the barrel, and was not disappointed when it came.  I have not handloaded for it yet, but am shooting 1/2 inch 5 shot groups at will at 100 yards using the Hornady ammo off the bipod, and I haven't sandbagged it yet.  The recoil is so light you can see the bullet holes appear through the scope.

Gendel barrels and bolts where hard to find and on a long wait list BEFORE December.  I had about $2200 in this gun alone BEFORE this nonsense started.  I suspect it would be well over $3k to build the gun now if you can find the parts, and a long wait.  

I don't want to let it go, but too many mouths/chambers to feed.  Not interested in trades.  Price is firm.  REDACTED"

I bought this 7 months ago for double MSRP on gunbroker, if you have to question value of this gun it is definitely not for you, and obviously you don't understand the rarity of this of this gun.  If you want to do cash I am looking for 850.00. No one has a better price on this than me just want my money back out of it that I put into it....

 Per state police 3 day waiting period on handguns for private sales must have valid foid and this is cash only no checks, must be over 21 to purchase. If you prefer to use FFL that is fine, I am fine with face to face sales. Please follow your local ordinances for firearms. I also will not ship it and not interested interstate sales and no paypal purchases cash transactions only. 

email me if interested, also you must buy it you can not have your family buy it for you {Straw Laws}.

BUTTSTOCK:
The Magpul CTR (Compact/Type Restricted) – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement butt stock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The extra-power lock mechanism uses a premium chrome-silicon spring to avert auto-collapse failure and maintains strength by resisting spring relaxation. The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes wobble* for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy. The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear"
