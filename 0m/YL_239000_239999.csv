I'm in Alabama right now, and can do FTF. I'm coming home (NC) for Christmas, so if you want it, I can bring it then OR if you have to have it now, we can work out a shipping deal.

The color in the picture below is a little distorted. the gun is true flat OD green even though it looks like olive green in the picture. notice the bolt is being held wide open :) this thing is super easy to load mags into the receiver!


 It was converted when I got it, since then I have added a Commercial diameter 6 position buffer tube and standard M4 style stock on a drop down extension, Modified MOE pistol grip, Tapco G2 trigger, TAC 47 industries auto plug, UTG quad rail w/ short and long top rails. duracoated the buffer tube, receiver, dust cover, and barrel flat O.D.

S12 also has had the safety modeled into a bolt hold-open device, which works great seeing as how difficult loading an S12 with the bolt closed can be. also works great for home defense- no need to store a round in the chamber- just leave the mag in, release the bolt AND then you have the perk of scaring someone to death with the ""pump action"" sound and the benefit of an autoloading shotgun!

2- 10 rd ProMag mags

(all magazines will remain loaded with a mix of factory 00, Slugs, and Turkey loads... that's 40 rounds of the good stuff including double ball (my favorite)

There are quite a few forum members who can testify to this shotguns reliability (and accuracy with rifled slugs and .68 caliber balls). I plan on taking it to my local range, mixing the drum with low brass birdshot and high brass buckshot and posting it, showing how reliable this thing is.

PAY ATTENTION

The stock is  designed for a BLIND MAGAZINE. However it can be  cut out and  refinished for a  rifle that accepts detachable magazines. i will not cut the stock out for you nor will I do any of the  wood work on the stock. 
As it sits the  inletting can accept a Savage 110 but the final fitting sanding and finish will need to be completed.

The stock will NEED to be FITTED to your rifle and to your handgrip. its just   a 96%-98% stock. the sanding/shaving to fit your hand contour AND the final sanding, stain and bedding the rifle still needs to be completed. its now set up for a  factory contour barrel although it can be  reshaped for a heavy barrel if one wishes to do so. Again I will not do the additional work for the gun.
if you have no wood working experience this is not the stock for you.
prefer cash local sale but will ship. i do not take pay pal.i do however have a friend who will accept pay pal  but you must add 3% to cover the costs.

The original stock is black and I have to believe if you desire to return the gun to its original state you should not have a problem.  
The gun has a rail mounted on the bottom and can accommodate your accessories.  The top is currently mounted with the factory optional ghost ring sight.  The gun is also outfitted with a magpul 45 degree grip on the forarm.  I also will be included a Ruger Mini-14 scope mounting kit that fits the PC9. 
There are a total of 3 clips that will be included. The clips are identical to the Rugers P series handguns so finding replacements should not be a problem.  
The action on this gun is identical the the 10-22 action and it cycles like butter. 
The scope and bipod are not included in the deal.  However,  I can bore sight a red dot on the gun for an added price.

I have seen several of these guns go for roughly $600 on gunbroker over the past several weeks.  None of these included any extras and usually were pretty dinged up.

I also will entertain trade offers.

If need be, I can accept payment through paypal.  However, 3% will be added to the final agreed upon price."

Diamondback DB380 ACP is a micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."

Custom Saiga 7.62x39 up for sale or trade... this is a sweet rifle! Only reason I'm looking to sell it is because I want to try to find a pistol for my wife. So here is what I've had done to it.. Barrel has been threaded to standard AK thread (14:1 LH) and a U.S. demon brake added, Front sight post has been removed, H&K sights have been added to the gas block and dust cover (welds are strong and clean). Bullet guide has been added and mag catch filed down to allow for standard AK mags, Tapco stock/pistol grip combo has been added (FCG is stock and has not been moved). I was going to profile down where the factory rear sight connects but I ran across red dot mount from midwest industries that uses that as a mounting point so I decided to leave it as is. It also comes with 3x tapco 30 round mags, 1x tapco 10 round mag, soft case and factory saiga stock and 10 round mag... feel free to email with any questions."

Helping a friend sell his Kahr CW45 (.45 ACP) pistol. This gun is as close to LNIB condition as they get having only been through a couple hundred round break in then put away which you’ll see is apparent in the pictures. The CW45 is also wearing a Crimson Trace trigger mounted style laser sight. This CT like most of their grips as it is activated simply by gripping the grip normally and engaging the light pressure switch located on the front strap just under the trigger guard itself. Kahr CW45 pistols are some of the slimmest and most reliable non-1911 .45 Auto pistols out there. This one is no exception with a super short and smooth DAO trigger, easy takedown and the CT laser sight which adds NO thickness to the gun whatsoever. 

He’s not looking to separate the Crimson Trace and the gun for sale so it’ll be a package deal with 1 factory magazine included and an Uncle Mike’s felt IWB holster. $500 FTF only to CO residents and he’d like to have a bill of sale. I know it’s not required for private party sales and how some of you guys feel about it, but it’s the seller’s prerogative for his own protection. Meeting area preferred in NoCo area and I-25 corridor.

Questions are welcome. I respond fast and friendly as indicated in the Feedback Forum.

First off, I would like to state that I'm not positive that this is a bring back rifle as I have no certificate to prove so, I'm just somebody who got lucky on finding it and having the privilage of trying to figure it all out.

Some back story; I picked this rifle up from a friend a while back with the utmost intention of ""fixing it up"" (I thought it had just been left to rust in somebody's garage for a few decades, so I figured why not get a new project, right?). After receiving the rifle I noticed there were no import marks where they should be. After getting home and field stripping it, I scoured through every inch of the rifle and discovered no import marks anywhere on the gun. From then I then began the hunt for information on this piece.

First I searched how to figure out date on it, finding that serial numbers in the 10,000,000 are from 1966 production (This one is early 1966 - 101,4xx,xxx) I knew where to  start from. After that I searched for more details on that production year, and here's what I found so far; The receiver is pre 1966 type since it doesn't match the post 1965 designs (Possibly made before they integrated the next design). Next I found out that it had an older bayonet lug and front sight variant for blade types, which is odd because 1966 is when they switched to spike bayonets, funnily enough the stock is a 1964 type with a spike cut out. Also among other things the barrel lug matches with 1966 production, and the stock retainer has a blade cut instead of spike. In all it's kind of an odd combo of parts if you really think about it, but then again at a turn or change of production pieces there could be a mix of parts.

After finding out everything I did, at that point I started focusing on the stock which was refinished by my friend (Sanded, steamed, and coated with polyurethane sadly). I toyed with the idea of stripping it and trying to restore it and get back an ""original battlefield"" look for coolness, but after looking at it under light I discovered what looked like carvings on the left side above the magazine area. Out of everything, all I can make out is Live/Love, SWOEO, and ""thy"", I'm really not sure if this would be something from a GI, but it's interesting either way.


I took it to my local gun shop owner who is a Vietnam Veteran to get a second opinion and he agreed with the idea that it's a bring back and could possibly have been one that a soldier threw in to his rucksack after recovering it from a battle or ""lifting"" it from elsewhere. He couldn't say for certain if it was, even though he's seen many that have looked the same. But regardless of thoughts and ideas, what is for certain is that there's no import mark or marks and also the fact that the stock is extremely worn from use, both of which have lead me to believe that there's at least maybe an 70% chance of it being a battlefield, rathole, or ""other"" capture/pick-up.



Specifications & Details:
Manufacture: Arsenal 26, Early 1966 - China
Condition: Outer bluing wear is around 50%-60%
Bore: Bore is EXCELLENT (Shiny) with slight frosting
Crown: Perfect except for a minute chip on one of the lands
Functionality: I took it out for a test a few weeks ago and ran 3 types of ammunition through it - Portuguese, Yugoslavian, and East German, no malfunctions of the sort were to be had or heard, and groupings were about 5"" at 100 yards by spitting them out at random.


If you have any questions and offers, please text, call, or email me at (Two-Zero-Five, Nine-One-Nine, Three-Four-Four-Three).

Price is $900 or best offer (Just make your best offer and we'll see what we can come up with). Instead of being in Fort Payne I'm in Birmingham right now staying in the hospital with my son, the rifle also tagged along with me in case I find a seller closer to here than Fort Payne so I can conserve gas.

*Also, please note that the rifle has a BLADE bayonet now, and not a spike like the picture depicts, since the spike wobbles down and the blade fixes in position I replaced it since the spike wasn't original anyhow.


Thanks for viewing!"

The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.
With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.
Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.

Picked this up summer 2011 to keep in my vehicle, however I would like to fund another project.  It includes a Hogue hand grip that makes the gun much more comfortable, a ""compact"" magazine, and an ""extended"" magazine with a finger lip.  Gun shoots well on Monarch 115g FMJ (Academy's brand) and Winchester PDX1.  It does not like Winchester White Box bulk packs.  Also included is a simple holster that was just used when transporting to/from the car so there were no fingers near the trigger.  This is a great little gun if you're short on cash but want to be able to protect yourself or your family.

Remember, Hi-Points come with a transferable lifetime warranty and are made in the USA.  I can meet FTF in the Auburn/Montgomery area, and purchaser must be 21 and willing to sign a bill of sale.

I used to hike in bear country and having this pistol at my side gave me excellent piece of mind.  You can shoot either 45 Long Colt or 454 Casull.  I don't hike in bear country any longer so I have decided to sell my Alaskan.  It was never abused in any way.  Never carried in rain.  Never dropped.

The Uncle Mikes holster is for a regular size belt that most people wear.

The Law Enforcement duty holster was custom made for me by Kirkpatrick Leather.  The duty holster fits the larger law enforcement style belts as shown in the picture.  Finding a duty holster for the Ruger Alaskan was a challenge.  I never did carry in this holster because my plans have changed.

Full descriptions of them below. I am interested in any name brand semi-auto handguns (glock, XD, colt, kahr, kimber, s&w, etc) any name brand assault rifles (rock river, bushmaster, dpms, etc) or large caliber sniper rifles. I do not want junk, and no off-brand hi-point quality guns. I am willing to give full value for your trades, but not to trade 100%. I need to walk away with some cash out of whatever deals are made, only selling the bikes to help pay some bills coming up. 

2004 Honda CBR1000rr. 15,XXX miles, custom synergy green paint with airbrushed ""bio-mechanical"" graphics. Gel/memory foam seats, flush mount turns, intergrated LED tail with sequential turns, new Pirelli tires on color-matched wheels. Brand new NGK spark plugs ($17 each!) fresh oil and coolant change. New battery. Black shorty levers. Runs and rides perfect. ONLY thing it needs is one fork seal is leaking, easy fix but haven't had time. Clean title. Asking $4900 (books over $6400 in STOCK condition) cash or trade. 

2002 Suzuki GSXR600 13,XXX miles. brand new battery, stator, fluid changes and plugs. Runs/rides great, no complaints. Newer tires. Custom black paint with airbrushing on the sides and tail. (has some recent scratches on both sides from falling over off the kickstand on one side, then losing balance while sitting still and falling over on the other side). This bike isn't cosmetically perfect, but is a great looking bike none-the-less. I purchased this bike to build as a stunt bike, because there is no title. Its too nice to stunt imo, and ive put quite a few miles on it as is. I will provide the vin to those interested so they can verify it isn't stolen, but it will be sold bill of sale only. You can pursue getting a replacement title or just stunt/tracking it. Asking $2100 cash or trade

2000 Honda CBR600F4 18,XXX miles. New tires, plugs, fluids. Full Jardine exhaust. Runs/rides great. clean title. The plastics on this bike need some repair, and repaint, but structurally and mechanically this bike is perfect. All lights, levers, pegs, etc are in great shape, only cosmetic plastic stuff needs fixing. Perfect to go custom or stunt with. (I am also a professional painter, so if you wanted the plastics fixed up we could work that out too.)
Asking $1500 cash or trade

I am interested in trading any or all of these bikes. Like I said, I need to walk away with some cash, but not afraid to take a lot of value in guns in lieu of a lot of cash. Specifically interested in AR's or bolt rifles chambered in .308, or high end pistols (kimber, colt, etc) but will entertain ANY trades, that aren't junk.
