This device from Belkin creates perfect harmony between a digital camera and your iPod. Connect the media reader to the iPod, and it will copy digital photos from any storage card (CompactFlash, Secure Digital, SmartMedia, MultiMediaCard, or Memory Stick). Your iPod's hard drive stores the photos until the next time you sync to a PC or Mac, though Mac users will have the photos automatically imported into iPhoto. If you've ever had to carry around a laptop in order to dump photos from your camera, you'll quickly see why this is such a big deal for shutterbugs--especially the photographer on the go. The media reader requires four AAA batteries and is compatible with docking iPods only."

LWRC® M6A2 SPR 16"" Black

The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

Bravo Company makes their AR-15 rifles completely mil-spec. These are not your low end AR-15's that most people have listed on this website. These are very sought after and very tough to get at a time like this. Anyone that knows a thing or two about AR's will vouch for how well bravo company makes their rifles and with a little research you will find out how amazing they are.

I have around 200 rounds thru this rifle without a single hiccup. People have reported shooting tens of thousands of rounds thru these rifles without any problems. I have cleaned the gun after each and every use as well. It is my pride and joy and i treat it as that. This is also a factory built BCM rifle, it isnt a lower and upper that someone has pieced together.

These are factory specs of the rifle.

Serial # puts date of manufacture at 1958, possibly issued to VC soldiers during the Vietnam Conflict.

It has a blade bayonet as opposed to the typical Norinco spike bayonet (""pig-sticker""), similar to the Russian SKS from which it was copied. All serial numbers are matching and bore is in fantastic condition. The gun is currently in a Romanian stock in fair condition, but I still have the (totally original) stock it came with when it was still packed in cosmoline, pictured below. Also included is a (non-original) sling, also pictured below. Finally, I'm adding 100 rounds of steel-cased 7.62x39mm Wolf Performance Ammo.

I'm sure you're aware that both the rifle and the ammo are very difficult to find right now with all the political turmoil. The SKS can be endlessly customized to suit any needs, with a wide array of aftermarket parts like synthetic adjustable and folding stocks, scope adapters, red-dot sights, etc etc. I've kept this one stock, meaning you can do with it what you wish while still being able to return it to its original state if you'd like. Goes from near-AK-clone to 1950s carbine in no time."

Up for sale or trade is this Norinco SKS with the 30 round magazine. I have only shot it enough to know that it will hit a cow turd at 75 yards, walk a beer can up a bank, and with a little 'Kentucky windage' will hit our gong at 400 yards. It has scratches and dings in the soft wood stock from typical handling and shooting , but the action and bore are in pretty good condition. All the numbers match. I have shot about 20 rounds of 'good' ammo through it and about 100 rounds of the cheapest on the market and it has yet to jam. I am in Laramie during the week and Casper on the weekends. 
This is a basic SKS with the 30 round magazine.  Nothing special.
I can text or email more pictures if you need. All transactions will be face to face.  I will not ship."

The carbine barrel was done by KKF. The RRA 9mm bolt was modified by KKF to accept the .357 sig rim. To tame the .357 sig cartridge I got an carbine ""X"" buffer from Saw Sales and the weight is 7.9 oz. The buffer spring is a Wolff extra strength carbine spring. I put about 500 rounds through the carbine before I decided to start another project. This is designed to work in the Colt type system and will work with modified Uzi mags and modified Sten mags for those that have a sten mag block. 
The only work done on the underside of the bolt was to shave the right side a hair to give better clearance on Sten mags. 

I have since added the Larue 9.0, and fitted the barrel to a MUR-1. You will get everything from the original ad, 2 uzi mags, mag block and whatever ammo I have(probably 200rds or so). Note about the rail, I lost the little dohicky that goes by behind the rail by the receiver, this does not affect the function at all. 

This is for the upper receiver only, if you want the lower as well tack on another $1200 to the price tag because it is an Armalite lower with an LMT stock.

Only 20 bullets down the barrel and I have run a hoppes bore snake after every shot. Very light and nice to shoot. A lot quiter without the bird cage flash hider and stays on target very well! Upper fits very tightly to the lower unlike other AR's I've owned; not naming names. I have no problem with someone wanting to test fire with the requirement that barrel is swabbed after every 3rd shot and no rapid firing at this time. I know, everyone has their own opinion on breaking in a barrel and whether or not it is necessary and I too have my own opinion. It certainly doesn't hurt anything doing it this way. Serious enquiries only and optic and magazine is not included but will sell for an extra $400 more as they are brand new as well. I do require a copy of a drivers license and a signed statement stating you are in no way prevented from owning this firearm. I'm sure you understand. First person with $1500 cash gets it."

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W, the SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

This is an AA Arms Pistol, model AP-9, manufactured from 1991 until 2001 in Indian Trail, North Carolina. It is a direct descendant and copy of the notorious Intratec KG-9 from the late 1970s. This was, to the best of our knowledge, the final clone of the KG-9. The KG-9 stirred up some action and warnings from the BATF, an agency that has always been more patient than many of us give them credit for, because that pistol fired from an open bolt. The KG-99 and this pistol, the AP-9, will release the sear from a bolt position that is only about halfway open. While the Intratecs had aluminum alloy lower frames, this one has a rough textured polymer lower frame. It is more ornage than its predecessor, with larger sights and a grooved muzzle barrel instead of a threaded barrel. Weight empty is about 3 1/2 pounds. Barrel length is 5 inches, and the included magazine holds 35 rounds"".

I am putting up for sale all of my airsoft gear. this is top quality stuff. Some of the parts on the gun are off of real firearms. It has been upgraded and is a tack-driver. It shoots right at about 400-402 fps consistently, and has a very high rate of fire, especially with the larger 9.6v battery. This is absolutely everything you need to jump right into the sport at a highly competitive level. I am more than happy to answer any questions you might have. I have gotten my fair share of use out of this stuff, and it is time for someone else to enjoy it. Now, in college, I do not have the time to get out anymore. Along with the items, I am listing, to the best of my knowledge, what I paid for these new. At the end of the ad I will include my asking price(s). Everything is used, and shows the normal wear.
