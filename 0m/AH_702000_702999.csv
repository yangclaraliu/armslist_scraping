Price is firm or I will keep and shoot it myself. MUST SIGN BILL OF SALE!  Have a little extra money if you want to trade a handgun. Can be used but must be in good condition."

I am looking to purchase a compact or sub-compact weapon for CCW purposes. I would prefer .40 because I have quite a few boxes of shells, but I would also consider 9 or 45 if the gun/price is right. 

I want to keep it under $500 but if an incredible deal comes along, I could go as high as $600

I live and work downtown (5th ward) and would prefer to meet closer to here,  if you don't mind traveling (the brakes went out on my car this morning). 

Because of the price, and what I am used to, I think a polymer gun is probably the reality. 

I have experience with Glocks, XDs, but am interested in Kahr M&P, Sig, etc. Doesn't have to be NIB but needs to be in excellent condition - prefer one owner, and the seller to be a stand-up person. 

I have bought and sold a few guns on Armslist - so I understand how people can waste your time - don't worry I will not waste yours. 

I am in a bit of a rush because soon, extra money is going to have to go to Christmas gifts :)

Remington has introduced the first ""Tactical"" pump 20 Gauge into the market which comes with a 2 round extension tube giving you 6+1 rounds with an 18"" barrel. Why a tactical 20 Gauge instead of 12? because you get almost the same wound/pattern/penetration with a lot less recoil. 

I've got it priced cheaper than you can buy it new before tax so you have to decide if you want it or not, not if I can pricing low enough to make you want it. That's a concept on armslist that a lot of people don't get. Also I'm looking for cash, the only possible trade might be a tactical 12 gauge or 40/9/380/300aac ammo."

This is the new E2 frame with 1 piece grips. Bought the gun with intentions of using it for IDPA but I cant seem to stop using my XD40. Gun was only removed from wrapper for pics, the imperfections you see is the cosmo still on the gun. Also comes with a brand new never fired 357 SIG barrel that can be swapped in this gun and comes with a SIG SAUER shoulder bag. Comes with case, paperwork, lock, lube, fobus paddle holster, and 2 mags (1 still sealed in plastic).

Asking $925 which is well below what I have in the package. Will sell the gun and 357 SIG barrel by itself for $850 but will not separate any further unless I sell the barrel first. Will do a partial trade on a Springfield XDS or some .22's, no revolvers though with cash on your end. Or open to other offers.

Will also do a partial trade for a LNIB I Pad plus cash or guns on your end.

With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches specification and precision engineering like Springfield Armory.

I had to switch my back up gun caliber, so now I don't have the need for this one anymore. These are in my opinion one of the best pocket pistols made. I have had many small .380's and this is by far the most reliable one I have found. I was able to do our full size primary pistol qualifications with this and still keep a 8 inch group with absolutely no malfunctions scoring a perfect score. Mind you that we shoot from 3-75 feet and there is movement at every stage but one. I would say that is extremely good for a pistol this size. One extra mag is included, all mags have the extensions on them. I am selling one more of these as I like to carry two of them if they were all I was carrying. These are the glocks of pocket pistols. Check out my other listing and you can do the same. Please contact me with any questions."

The P229® is one of the most popular law enforcement pistols available today. Its nearly indestructible design outlasts, and out performs, other pistols so much so that after extensive testing with over 3,000,000 rounds fired, the Dept. of Homeland Security’s office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) selected the P229 over pistols from five other major manufacturers. Now the P229 is the standard duty pistol for not just DHS but also the U.S. Coast Guard, and is carried by other federal agencies that we aren’t permitted to discuss.

Both guns are made in Hungary by the FEGARMY Arms factory (formerly known as Fegyver es Gazkeszuelekgyara NV). The P9R uses the modified P9 frame and action, but the classic FN GP-35 Single Action trigger system is replaced with Smith&Wesson-style Double Action system. The P9R-series pistols are now available in two basic forms, the full-size P9R and short-barreled P9RK. Over the time, FEG also produced a lightweight, aluminum-framed version of the P9R, called the P9RA, which apparently is no longer made. There is also a .45 caliber derivative of P9RK, which also have a single-stack magazine that holds only 8 rounds. The .45ACP version is designated as FEG ACK (export models of ACK were sometimes marked as GKK-45). In Europe the FEG P9R was also known as the Mauser 90DA, as it was imported and distributed through the famous German Mauser organization.

The P9R is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. The barrel is operated using a Browning cam system, and is locked to slide by three locking lugs on the top of the barrel, which fit into mated recesses on the inside of the slide, just ahead of the ejection port. Frame and slide are made from carbon steel and usually have blued finish. The Double Action trigger system with external hammer has a slide-mounted safety lever, which also works as a decocker when safety is engaged. The P9RK pistol differs from basic P9R by having a shorter barrel and slide, as well as finger grooves on the grip. The .45 caliber ACK pistol is slightly thinner, as it has a single stack magazine for rounds, instead of the double stack magazine for 14 rounds in P9R pistols. On all P9R series pistols the front sight is permanently fixed to the slide, while rear sight is dovetailed."

It has had only enough rounds through it to sight the glass. I was thinking about selling or selling/partial trade for AR10 parts. I have an AR10 that I want to convert to a SASS system. I have found that the AR10 with a Timney trigger shoots as good or better than the 700 in some scenarios. As of a result of this, I am rarely using the 700. It hasnt been out of the house since I sighted it in when I bought it 4 months ago. See below for description of 700:

Remington 700 SPS Tactical in .308
Heavy 20 inch barrel
Hogue Over Mold Stock
Glass Bedded (By me)
Weaver 20MOA Rail
Weaver 4-20x50 with 30mm tube Tactical Riflescope Part #800630 with external target knobs, FFP, and zero reset.
Can be viewed at Weaveroptics.com. Was $1200 dollars.
Leupold Tactical Rings
Harris Bi-pod
Slingmaster Sling with thumb loop
Trigger set to 3.5 lbs, VERY CLEAN. NO creep.
Blackhawk cheek pad and storage bag.

I sighted this rifle in using only Federal GMM 168grn Sierra BTHP's. I can consistently shoot sub MOA off a rest at 300 yards. I have shot it 900 yards at steel silhouette targets. The scope is crystal clear and offers unlimited field of adjustment. Once you know your ""dope"" for the correct yards and wind conditions, it will shoot all day where you want it to.

I have an AR-10 that I have installed a BMC bolt group, heavy barrel, heavy buffer and spring, and Timney trigger in. Currently it has an Eotech 512 non magnified and I can shoot soda cans at 300 yards all day using the same GMM ammo. 

I want to build the 10 up as I do not use the 700 anymore.

I have had many small .380's and this is by far the most reliable one I have found. I was able to do our full size primary pistol qualifications with this and still keep a 8 inch group with absolutely no malfunctions scoring a perfect score. Mind you that we shoot from 3-75 feet and there is movement at every stage but one. I would say that is extremely good for a pistol this size. One extra mag is included, all mags have the extensions on them. I am selling one more of these as I like to carry two of them if they were all I was carrying. These are the glocks of pocket pistols.

This complete upper was built by Adco Firearms.  

It has the following:
-16"" standard profile 1:8 twist  stainless 5.56 barrel from blackhole weaponry, barrel is MPI and HP tested. It also has polygonal rifling that will increase barrel life, slightly increase velocity and is very accurate. 1:8 will stabilize more bullet weights than 1:7 or 1:9, from light up to heavy rounds. Has A2 flash hider.
-Mil spec upper kit installed on a surplus arms stripped upper
-11"" Troy Alpha rail. This rail is very light weight and very solid. It is free floated. It only has one rail, on the top to mate with the receiver, making the whole thing a flat top. The other sides are round with holes for grip. Also has three detachable rail sections, one of which has a quick detach hole for sling mounts. Rail is installed, but since these attach to the USGI barrel nut, it can be removed if necessary. 
-foliage green magpul mbus sights. These are gen 2, both front and rear.

I only have 100 rounds through this, 60 xm193 and 40 m885. Shoots great. I sent it to Adco to be put together, they did a wonderful job.

Also included are the Quik Connect adapters for checking all major brand coils. 5 coil adapters and two plug wire adapters. These make diag a breeze for mis-fire. Takes all the guess work out and you will never have to switch coils and clear codes then test drive a again. This diag tool is also great when you think you have a bad position sensor for cam, crank, or steering. Check the reluctor wheel with out taking anything apart. System also has accurate wiring diagrams and pin locations so you won't have to go look it up. This was my favorite diag tool I owned. I owned the first Vantage O-scope and traded in the day my dealer showed me this Vantage Pro.

TECHNICAL SPECS-

CALIBER: 22 Long Rifle High Velocity
CAPACITY: 10, 24 rounds, detachable
WORKING SYSTEM: Semi-automatic recoil operated
Overall Length: 34.5”
Barrel Length: 16.5

The .22lr “Kalashnikov” manufactured by GSG represents much more than a small caliber “knock-off” of a famous rifle. The GSG-AK47 is not only a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate, but it actually bears the name “Kalashnikov.” 

GSG is currently the only company in the entire world licensed by Mr. Kalashnikov to manufacture real, functioning firearms, and they have not taken this opportunity lightly. The low cost of shooting .22lr ammo is attractive, but not really at the expense of an unfamiliar rifle with awkward controls and an uncertain reliability aspect. Fortunately for those who of us who like military rifles, all these issues were not a factor with the GSG-AK47. The look, feel and controls are almost identical to the most heavily proliferated rifle system in the world. From the first time it is handled and shouldered, the heavy wood and comfortable stock length give the shooter the real feel of a familiar rifle. 

The magazine works and looks great and the accuracy potential was surprisingly well. Whether it is for los-cost training on the real system, a departure from the usual noise to give your neighbors a break, to help a youngster learn to handle this style rifle without the recoil and intimidation of the muzzle blast or just plain for fun, we think the GSG-AK47 will make a nice addition to any military firearms collection."
