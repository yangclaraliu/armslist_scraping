I have always been a huge supporter of EOTech. Esp since I used one down range during deployment. I recently picked this EOTech EXPS3-4 up about less than a month ago. I've installed on my AR-15 Carbine & shot about a 100 rounds at an outside range. And just like all EOTech's... this badboy is VERY High Quality.

Reason for selling is that I came to the conclusion that I need to invest in a side arm pistol next, so the money from the EOTech will come in handy.

THE UF STANDS FOR UNDERFOLDER. THIS AK DOES NOT HAVE A WOODEN STOCK. IT HAS AN UNDERFOLDER SIMILAR TO THE GERMAN SMG IN WW2. THIS WAS DESIGNED FOR PARATROOPERS AND ELITE SOVIET MOUNTAIN TROOPS ON SKIS AND WHATNOT. THE RIFLE DID NOT COME WITH THE CLEANING ROD BUT WAS PURCHASED OUT OF POCKET BY ME AND IT WILL COME WITH THE RIFLE WHEN I SELL IT OR TRADE IT. COMES WITH THE CLEANING ROD, THE CLEANING KIT THAT NORMALLY GOES IN THE STOCK, AS WELL AS A EAST GERMAN STYLE BAYONET MADE OF BAKELITE. PISTOL GRIP IS PLASTIC BUT I ALSO HAVE AN ORIGINAL BAKELITE PISTOL GRIP AS WELL IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL THAT INSTEAD TO GIVE IT A MORE TRADITIONAL LOOK.  THE TRIGGER IS A TAPCO G2. RIFLE HAS A SLANT MUZZLE BREAK. I ALSO PURCHASED A SIGHT ADJUSTMENT TOOL FOR SKS OR AK RIFLES BUT HAVE NOT USED IT YET. I ALSO PURCHASED A MODERN SLING FOR THE AK WHICH WORKS QUITE WELL AND IS EASILY ADJUSTABLE.  I INSTALLED A BROWNELLS RECOIL BUFFER AND HAVE CLEANED THE COSMOLINE OFF, OILED, CLEANED, AND REASSEMBLED THE RIFLE AFTER I PURCHASED IT NEW FROM A GUN SHOP IN THE MIDWEST.  I HAVE FIRED LESS THAN 1 640 ROUND SPAM CAN OF AMMO  THROUGH THE RIFLE AND NEVER HAD A MISFIRE OR JAM, ONLY PROBLEM IS RUNNING OUT OF AMMO BEFORE I AM DONE HAVING FUN SHOOTING, BUT THAT IS NOT THE RIFLES FAULT OBVIOUSLY.  THE IRON SIGHTS ARE ACCURATE AND NOT CANTED.  HOWEVER, BEING AN UNDER FOLDER MODEL, THERE IS NO RAIL TO ATTACH A SCOPE.  SO, IF YOU WANTED TO INSTALL A SCOPE YOU WOULD HAVE TO USE 1 OF THOSE CHEESY DUST COVER SCOPES THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP ZEROED. WHY ANYONE WOULD WANT A SCOPE ON AN UF IS BEYOND ME BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD LET YOU KNOW.  IRON SIGHTS WORK GREAT FOR ME. ALSO, THE RIFLE CAME WITH 2 30 ROUND MAGS, THE MAG WELL IS NOT SLOPPY, AND DOESN'T WOBBLE WITH STEEL MAGS.  HOWEVER, WITH TAPCO PLASTIC MAGS THE FIT IS A LITTLE BIT TIGHT BUT NOT SERIOUS BECAUSE THE MAG WELLS ON THESE RIFLES ARE OPENED UP TO ACCEPT DOUBLE STACK MAGAZINES. IF YOU BUY THE RIFLE I WILL THROW IN THE 6 OR 7 MAGAZINES I BOUGHT OUT OF POCKET AT 15 BUCKS A PIECE FREE OF CHARGE IF YOU CAN MAKE ME A GOOD DEAL.  OVER ALL I HAVE QUITE A BIT OF MONEY INVESTED IN THIS RIFLE AND WOULD LIKE TO GIVE IT A GOOD HOME AND TRADE IT TO SOMEONE WHO WILL APPRECIATE THE HISTORY AND PEDIGREE OF THESE GREAT RIFLES."

S3® antimicrobial technology aids in odor control. SPF 60 ScentBlocker Cold Fusion™ micropowdered activated carbon is fused onto the fabric to provide total coverage and reduce odor. Adjustable zipper and Boa lacing port on lower leg. Adjustable high waist with belt loops. Zipper fly with side-by-side snap closure. Contoured seat and knees. Two front and rear upper zippered pockets; two lower front waterproof, zippered pockets; and one cargo pocket. 16"" leg zippers.

I say stock because I really am not interested in most of the aftermarket mods that people put on it, and would prefer to buy cheap initially and upgrade my own way over time.  If the rifle is mostly stock but has a scope, bipod, maybe a bull barrel, etc., then shoot me an email if you are willing to sell around $200 (perhaps a little more with a barrel, I'll have to evaluate that on a case-by-case).  The only thing that I am absolutely not interested in is your $500+ 'tacticool' souped up monstrosity.  

I know what I can get a 10/22 for new, so keep that in mind when you try to make a deal.

4.2 Engine
AX-15
Stock axles with 4.88 gearing
An aussie locker in the front
The axle disconnect was removed and replaced with a solid shaft
Brand new wiring harness (personally installed)
Herculiner in the tub
Hard Top and Bikini Top (the hard top has a soft window zip tied to the back, it could use a new one, works ok though)
Full sized doors with roll up windows
Custom dashboard with all switches moved to center
New complete exhaust system, very quiet
Oversized shackles, they are fine on the back, too big for the front though, but I ran it like that no problem
TJ double cardon front driveshaft
Trac and sway bars removed

The frame is solid, and I mean it. This thing came from Long Island a few years ago, it has some surface rust, but no rotting under there. The body is very sound too, one spot I fixed on the drivers side with a kick panel has a hole under it. And a couple spots that could be touched up, but no rotting.

There is one catch though, it doesn't come with wheels or tires, it is sitting right now on a borrowed set. Uses regular 5 lug jeep wheels, but I don't have any. It runs great with 35's, would probably be ok with 33's, don't even try it with smaller though, you won't break 30 mph with the low gearing.

I have lots of time and money into this old girl and it really is ready to rock and roll except the tires.

It comes with a clean title for $2200, I can't budge on the that price, so serious inquires only.

You are more than welcome to come look at it any time. Email or Call 607-745-eight 9 one 4

You will be responsible for trucking it, if you have a set of 35's you could drive it home, otherwise I would say trailer it.

I can get a trailer and haul it for you, but I will have to charge for the fuel depending on how far it is, my truck is thirsty.

I haven't been to a gun show this bad in 10 years or more - totally lame; not much better than a yard sale. Great if you want some plastic dog poo, tee shirts, or a $5 knife for the kids. Otherwise pretty much a ripoff. However, that's not why I'm posting. I just want to make sure if you're going, you only waste $7 instead of $8 like I did. Here's a $1 off coupon for you. Print it out and you won't feel quite so bad afterwards.

Not to be totally negative, Mosin Nagants were fairly priced and the one table with reloading componets had some primers for $25/thousand. There was also one dealer in quality knives. However, the entire gun show was in one relatively small (compared to most gun shows) area and even then actual gun stuff made up maybe 1/3 of the tables. The rest was crap. I'd bet there was less than 50 long guns in the building. I've been to gun shops with much, much more to see. Oh yeah, they had some TV guy there signing autographs for the ladies. Whoopee!

The action (DAO) is very tight and completely functional. The black finish is original, complete, and without flaw. The original Bakelite grips are in immaculate condition. The cartridge ejector works fine and the barrel's grooves are still visible. Overall, this pistol would easily rate at 95%.

This webpage has some detailed history of the pistol: http://www.nrvoutdoors.com/ENFIELD%20SNUB/ENFIELD%20SNUB.htm. In the first photograph on the left margin (with the red velvet background), my pistol is almost identical to the one in the middle. However, my pistol has the distinction of having a factory-installed lanyard loop in the frame at the base of the grip, similar to the pre-WWII pistol pictured at the top. Research shows that this feature is quite rare and indicates that this particular pistol was a British officer's pistol which would have seen little, if any, battlefield usage. This would also account for this pistol's pristine condition.

Provenance from the early 1960s can be provided. The original Hunter leather holster is included in this sale as well as three (3) new 50-round boxes of .38 S&W Remington Express cartridges. Attached are photographs of my actual pistol.

Only 300 rounds have been put through it. Its in excellent condition. In-fact, it's looks like it's never been shot or carried.

My wife bought this gun a few months ago for her EDC gun, and loves how it shoots and feels. She is just tired of polymer framed guns, though. She's had polymer Sigs, Glocks, and now this Polymer Bersa. She's wanting to get into a 1911s ever since she saw a Kimber chambered in 9mm, so she wants to sell the BP9CC.

It comes with everything it came with from the factory:
2 Magazines
hard case
Paperwork
Manual
etc

$350 - firm

Wanting to do a face to face transaction in the Upstate area.

Here are some pictures of it.  The gun was dirty at the time the pictures were taken because we photographed it right out of the box, so it had the factory grease still on it.  The gun looks very nice when cleaned up, though!  Also, the serial number has been edited out in the pictures:"

The TA11E incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. The TA11E allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Procedures For Testing Silver Using A Nitric Acid Testing Kit:


If you cannot find a mark or a stamp on the piece and you are looking for sterling silver, it does not mean it is not silver, many countries do not require that precious metal items be stamped. However there is a way to test it if you really want it and think it is worth the time and trouble to do it. Silver can be tested with nitric acid, be careful as it involves using an acid which can burn the skin. To apply you make a tiny scratch on the item in an inconspicuous place and apply a drop of nitric acid to the spot. If the spot turns a creamy colour it is high quality silver, usually sterling. (If it turns black it is coin quality silver) and if it turns green it has high amounts of copper and therefore is poor quality silver and a gold colour means a lot of brass, it means this is a silver plated item."

It’s not too early to be planning and testing your Easter Layout.  Carrying the little eggs and candy and chocolate round and round.  Cool.

First there is an LGB Short Island Railroad train set.  Includes the engine, two cars, 12 pieces of curved track, and the transformer.  It’s been run, but not really a whole lot.

Three Playmobil cars new and unused.  Two 4104 gondolas and one 4105 gondola with a load of pipes.

Two Bachman Big Hauler #44 South Pacific Coast Passenger Cars.  Also new and unused.  Sort of.  One car was on the track for a wee bit, but I don’t think it was ever actually placed into service.  There is but one box, and it is not at all pristine.  Far from it.

Finally, there is the track.  
•	Of course there is the original circle with 12 pieces of track.  
•	Ten Aristo-Craft 36” straight track.  Mostly new and unused, but not well cared for.  So it’s dusty and dirty.  But in otherwise great condition.  
•	Fourteen Aristo-Craft curved track new and unused and pristine.
•	Sixteen Aristo-Craft 12” straight track new and unused and pristine.
•	Fourteen Aristo-Craft 12” one-half curved track new and unused and pristine.
•	Two Aristo-Craft left turnouts new and unused and pristine.
•	Two Aristo-Craft right turnouts new and unused and pristine.

There’s a lot of trains here.  Perhaps too much for any one person to absorb.  I suppose the Bachman and/or the Playmobil cars could be sold first, together or separately.  Then the LGB Short Island train set.  Engine, cars, track, transformer.  And then finally the track and turnouts.

I arrived at the price by staring into the clouds until the moon rose, and then looking into the puddle left by the rain and asking:

“Puddle Puddle on the walk, 
Time for you to hear me talk,
what’s the price 
and tell me twice.”  

At which point my wife said the neighbors thought I was bereft of my senses and had locked their children and pets indoors.

So be it.  If you think, as do I, that this collection of Large Scale Trains is worth more, please feel free to offer more.  It will not embarrass me in the least.  In fact, it will warm my heart to know there are honest buyers left in the world.  Or at least in Arizona.

The time to buy is now.  Today.  I’m ready to wheel & deal.  What you see is what you will get.  Delivered, if need be, for a small fee.  Or mailed if that is your preference.  If you see this posting, it’s still for sale.  I will remove the posting within mere minutes after it has been sold.

Features include a 5 ½” barrel, rebated 6 shot cylinder, brass back strap and trigger guard, and walnut grips. Made in 2009, the entire finish of this gun has been 'antiqued' and its overall condition is excellent-plus; as can be seen on the right side picture there is not a mark on the wedge pin or barrel – the usual places brutalized by black powder hobbyists. The timing of the action is near perfect as the the cylinder stop drops and locks as it should with no drag on the cylinder; the hammer locking in place just a hair after. This piece is a good shooter and given its size and configuration, a handy little black powder revolver. New, these guns go for almost $300.00, and while the internet is full of used, BRASS framed Navy-type percussion guns for sale, there are not many of these to be found. This gun is well worth my asking price so please don’t email me and ask if I’ll take seventy five dollars for it. Shipping will be $18.00 nationwide. Depending on where you live, if it costs less than fifteen I’ll refund you the difference; if it’s more than eighteen, I’ll eat the additional cost.  Please feel free to email questions."

It has target turrets, an adjustable 40mm objective, and a one inch steel tube.  It’s a great scope for bench rest shooting.  Long range bench rest shooting.

This scope is in very very good condition.  It has obviously been mounted, and so there are very slight ring marks.  The finish is nice and dark and uniform.  Bright, crystal clear optics.  Amazingly bright and clear for a 25 power scope.  The reticle is a single cross-hair.

The scope has been used, but that has not affected its ability to perform.  Not much wear takes place looking through a glass.  I would be surprised if there were more than 100 rounds fired through the Sako, so it is unlikely there is any recoil damage to the scope either.

I’m selling it because I want less magnification.  The scope is mounted on a Sako Forester, which is not for sale.

Both O/U barrels are ported, are in near mint condition with matte finish
This set includes a third 32"" mono, High rib trap barrel with fixed full choke.
the mono barrel is in good condition but has some wear and is not indicative of the receiver as the mono was purchased used and is not original to the gun. The barrel was professionally fitted and operates flawlessly.
Receiver is nitride silver and stock is a beautiful Monte Carlo style.
Forearm is a matching beaver-tail type.
this shotgun is in 95% condition with only minor handling marks.
length of pull is currently 14-1/8"" adjustable to approx. 14-7/16"" includes extra gold plated wide trigger, I use the narrow trigger.
includes high quality locking gun case, barrel socks, and receiver sock.
This is a great opportunity for someone who needs a great trap gun but also likes to shoot trap doubles, sporting clays or skeet!
