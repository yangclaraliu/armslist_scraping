** Just for quick reference for you, here's what i'm looking to trade towards **
I am looking to trade this gun for multiple other guns, or quality guns WITH boot.
- Here's my ideal pairing:
Ruger SR1911 (45acp) + Ruger Mark III or 22/45 (22LR) & a Ruger 10/22 (or the SR22 version). All guns must have mags with them and preferably have ammo. Must be in great shape (minor wear from usage is okay, but mistreated and neglected guns are NOT)....your guns must also have a clean and legal history. I will check into them.

I would also consider trades towards the following guns (paired or with boot):
- Ruger SR22 (the pistol or rifle)
- Glock 17, 19, 26 or 34
- Springfield XD subcompact or full size (9mm versions)
- S&W M&P (9mm versions)
- Other nice 1911's
- 12 gauges

** Trade Value **
If your offer is not that exact pairing I've mentioned above, my trade value is around $2,000-2,200. Cash price is undecided as I'm more interested in getting the above mentioned guns....but if you want to buy it shoot me an offer."

Plus I have a Chiappa Firearms M4-22 .22 lr dedicated upper so you can do low cost training. The first two trips to the range are on me, since I have 100 rds of Federal .223 and 130 rounds of .22lr.  Two 30 round metal 5.56 mags with dual mag clip and one 28 round 22lr magazine are included.  
     Honestly this upper is truly a tier one AR product as good as anything out there. It has a 15' Samson EVO rail with additional small rails you can put anywhere, a NP3 Coated BCG, a smooth mid-length gas system, and a barrel that shot a 1.1"" five shot group at 100 yards(see pic).  I hate to let it go, but need the funds.  The Sionics upper is used, just purchased two months ago, everything else is new in box.  The polymer lower has a decent trigger.  You will probably want to add a red dot or similar optic.  
     The price is FIRM, no trades, face to face only. I prefer to do business with a CCW holder, so if you have one, note it in your email. I will take the ad down promptly upon sale.  
If you don't need the 22 upper I will take $1550 for the 5.56 rifle and one mag. The 5.56 ammo and the other mag are $60 together. Everything in the package together is $1900."

These outstanding rifles are perfect matches for someone who hunts with a quality rifle or wants to match this gun with a six-shooter in competition shooting.
  If you have followed the Henry Company news, you are aware that due to the recent Hurricane, they had to shut down production for an unknown period of time. In the 2013 publications by the company, and listings by Gun Digest, the prices on the Big Boy rifles has climbed to the $900 level. I have priced my new in the box Henry's to cover my costs and the tax and shipping I had to pay to get them. These are not big money makers for me. I will sell these  rifles for $950 EACH, firm price. Shipping costs, or delivery beyond 100 miles of Corydon Indiana, If you can't pick them up will be an additional $50, but I prefer a face to face transaction closer to home.

651,http://www.armslist.com/posts/896651,For Sale/Trade:  Bushmaster BA50 Shooting System,"South Metro - Bloomington, Bloomington, Minnesota","$ 9,950","Listed On: Saturday, May 4, 2013",Rifles,Bushmaster                                                                                ,50 BMG                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a complete long distance shooting system, not just the rifle.  To put this kit together would normally be difficult – unfortunately to put this together now would be almost insurmountable.  This is your opportunity if you have ever wanted a comprehensive set like this then count your pennies, sell your wife’s Beanie Baby collection, or ask yourself “Do both kids really need to go to college?”  

Most think of Barretts when they think of precision .50 caliber rifles.  The Bushmaster BA50 is actually more accurate.  The BA50 is a bolt action rifle which forms a better seal / even venting of gas and thus a more accurate round hurtling down range than a semi-automatic Barrett*.  

The BA50 is a 1 moa rifle – this isn’t common in 50's.  Thanks to Hollywood many believe all .50 calibers are used for surgical shooting.  Most multiple round .50's are good for distance and power but struggle getting close to 1 MOA.  

The March 2012 issue of Tactical Weapons has an article called ""Battle of the .50 BMGs"" which does a head-to-head comparison between the Bushmaster and the Barrett with the Bushmaster winning top marks.  Here is the website with that article:  

http://www.tactical-life.com/online/tactical-weapons/battle-of-the-50-bmgs/

The December 2009 issue of Special Weapons magazine also had a great – and positive – review of the Bushmaster BA50 that is worth reading.  

The kit I am selling consists of:  

Bushmaster BA50 rifle 
Leupold Mark 4 LR/T m1 (8.5 – 25x).  Specifically built as a top end .50 caliber rifle scope.  
BORS unit (Barrett Optical Ranging System) and software.  Basically a computer for the scope that allows you to enter ballistic data and range to the target, it then adjusts your point of aim for you.  This accounts for everything but wind value.   
Leupold ARD (anti-reflective device) 
Leupold magnetic covers 
Custom monopod
Custom cheek rest 
Barrett carry handle.  Mounted at the center point of weight (with the muzzle break) to allow for easier moving of the rifle.   
Barrett exRings (15 – 40 moa) 
Two 10-round magazines
Sentry Solutions treatment.  This makes for easier cleaning and added protection for the rifle.  
Leica 1200 laser range finder.  Again, nothing but the best, this provides some of the data for the BORS unit.   
Wind wizard handheld wind meter.  This provides wind data for the final calculation of those long distance shots.  
OTIS Barrett combat cleaning kit 
Big ol’ .50 cleaning rod 

Also includes the following complete ammo:

660 grain Federal full metal jacket rounds (x100)
PMC full metal jacket (x10)
Standard ball rounds (x33)
Tracer rounds (x5)
Incendiary rounds (x7)
APIT – Armor Piercing Incendiary Tracer rounds (x8)
Frangible (aka: Fragmented) rounds (x11) 
Hornady A-Max 750-grain rounds (x50)

10 snap caps for practicing trigger squeeze indoors without having to explain to the wife… and neighboring six houses… the new ventilation in their walls  :)

Both the muzzle break and the case have a custom image of skull and crossbones with a bullet hole through the skull.  This might be a good time to ask yourself how this set could get any cooler.  

The first two photos below were taken by the gentleman I bought the rifle from.  The third image is from a day at the range with a buddy... It was a good day.  If you need more images I can take them, but they will be from my cell phone and may not be quite as nice.  Here is a website with additional images and information about this specific rifle.  

http://barrettrifles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=1946

I can provide more information about the items listed above, but honestly if you have to ask this may not be the right system for you.  

I will need the buyer to sign a transfer slip and I will also need to see a permit to purchase or conceal carry permit.  

Reasonable trades toward this kit I would consider are: M1A1 / SOCOM16; M-14; High end AR (5.45 or 5.56 or .308); High end AK (in 5.45 or 5.56 or 7.62); Top of the line 1911’s; Camping / cabin land accessible to water; recreational items such as a boat with a cuddy cabin or Class C motor home; I'm fairly open to trades as long as the items are well taken care of and the weapons are in a common caliber.  

I will read and reply to all serious offers but I am not in a hurry to sell.  When this is gone I won’t be able to replace it.  I may hold off on moderate offers to see what else is out there.    

Update: This system is currently available for viewing and for running a slightly quivering hand down it, at Atomic Tactical in Bloomington.  

Summary: for sale is one bad a** complete shooting system that comes with everything but the spotter calling out range and wind value… Of course with a package this magnificent there shouldn’t be a shortage of people wanting to be your spotter. 

*To be clear, Barrett rifles are amazing performers, legendary, and deserving of much praise.  They have been battle tested and that's a thing to be respected... No sense starting something with the Barrett followers out there."

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

Improved rail adapter systems which enable firearms, including M16 type rifles and carbines, without any changes to the weapon except the handguard, to support accessory devices effectively even under combat conditions are provided via the invention by modification of the top semicylinderical part of the rifle's handguard attachment to include an elongated leaf spring arrangement in the front end and a unique rear clamp arrangement at the back end thereof so the leaf spring and rear clamp combination operate to compensate for thermal dimensional changes and combat abuse problems to maintain proper alignment of accessory devices attached to the weapon.

If you don't know about AK's, Russians are the best, for all around durability, exterior finish and accuracy. Here is why you want this russian over any others you buy.

Double hook, G2 trigger system with a clean crisp break. 

Thicker receiver, 50% thicker than all the others, this makes it stronger and more rigid for better accuracy. 

Shoot's 1.5-2.5""  groups at 100 yards with wolf surplus ammo if you do your part. In case you didn't know, that's very good for an AK-47. It can be 1"" with a quality federal or remington factory brass loads. 

This one has the side mount built in for scopes/ red dots.

Aftermarket furniture to include mag-pul grip. 

Stainless steel bolt group that will not corrode, others are painted. 

I know prices are high right now, If you need a cheap AK get a Romanian for $1200. This one will shoot as well as an AR, with more energy at 300 yards and it will be 300% more reliable.

From Remington site:

Get your high-volume shooting fix for less. Built on our famous Model 597 22 rimfire action, the new Model 597 VTR CS Quad Rail is a little gun with big-time centerfire attitude. It's fully equipped to accept modular repeating rifle accessories and provides more semi-auto plinking and hunting fun than you can shake its 16"" barrel at. Reliability and supreme accuracy are hallmarks of the Model 597 action - proudly hailed as the most advanced semi-automatic rimfire available today.
Model 597 VTR CS Quad Rail has a matte blued finished and black synthetic stock with a Pardus A2-style pistol-grip stock with collapsible design that provides rapid length-of-pull adjustment. This rimfire also has a quad-rail free-floated tube that gives you ample space to trick it out with accessories.
This truly is a nice rifle to have and shoot. It is a great fun target gun, varmint rifle and not to forget how cheap and readily available ammo is for this weapon.
The quad rail is same as AR15 format so any thing that fits an AR quad rail will work on this little gem. Lights, lasers, handgrips scopes.......

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Anyone who knows the AR-15 platform knows that Seekins Precision is arguably the best of the best. This was only fired for function check and gas block adjustment. Included in the sale are 5 30rd FDE Gen 2 Pmags 3 of which have FDE ranger plates. Also included is 180rds of SS109 62gr. FMJ, 100rds of Black Hills 75 Match HP, 50rds Hornady 55gr Vmax, and 20 rds of Hornady 77gr Match. Total of 350rds. I do not have to sell this rifle. I am only doing it to ""upgrade"" to nicer glass for one of my precision bolt guns. If it doesn't sell it will go back in the safe. Please do not call me asking to part it out or split the package..... it isn't going to happen. Mags and Ammo go with the gun period! Do not lowball me or call to waste my time. If you could find all of these parts which you can't it would cost over this amount to build this rifle in todays enviroment. If you ordered the same rifle from Seekins precision it would be well over a year wait. You will be required to show a valid TXDL or a CHL and sign a bill of sale. Parts list is below
