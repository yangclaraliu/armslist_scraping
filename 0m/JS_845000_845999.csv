These guns are rare and are hard to come by. I believe Colt only produced about 100 of these anually and this 1970cy carry model is the most difficult to find out of all of them. The finish on it is blue and pictures do not do this thing any justice. It appears to be unfired but i am not going to advertise it like that because i did not purchase it new. It does include the original matching Colt Box with sleeve, all paperwork including the factory test target, and 1 factory Colt mag. It also includes Trijicon Night Sights. MSRP on this gun is over $2000 so dont let it get away at a deal. If you have any questions, feel free to call or ask. Thanks for looking and have a great day!

The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597 all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, the 597 incorporates a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for Weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot ""hold open"" magazine feature and Remington's patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine.

I inherited it from my grandfather a few years ago, but do not plan to use it as I already have 12 and 20 gauges.  It appears these were manufactured for Sears' house brand by Stevens of their 5100 double barrel in pre-WW2 days.  I've not fired it but the action locks tight and both triggers and the safety work.  I plan to buy a box of shells to test it out soon.  There is no rust, just some finish wear in two spots in front of the hand guard and patina from aging.  Walnut wood is in great shape.  The rubber butt pad is hard.  Bore shows some wear but is still very bright with much life left in it.  Barrels are 28 inches in length with the right one having a modified choke and the left one a full choke.

Not quite sure what these are worth, but I found some completed sales on gunbroker in the $200-250 range for 12 and 20 gauge models.  Asking price is $225 OBO.  Must be an Ohio resident, 18 or older, and legally able to own a gun.  FTF only.  Let me know if you have any questions or want additional photos."

I inherited it from my uncle a two years ago but it's too tiny for me.  It is 33 inches in length with an 18-inch barrel.  It fires .22 short, long, and long rifle ammo.  From what I found online, it appears these were made between 1928 and 1934 and only about 40,000 were made.

The metal exhibits some corrosion (not rust) as seen in the pictures, and the stock has a crack on the left side (also seen in pictures).  I finally shot it for the first time Saturday afternoon.  I put 50 rounds through it and it shoots great.  I just cleaned and lubed it too.  The rifle is the right size for a child getting started with the shooting sports.

Included in this sale is one Olive Drab (OD) Green Sling and the Rifle.  This rifle has an attached bayonet fixed to it that is fully functioning and folds out underneath the barrel.  I am the second owner of the rifle and am unsure of the round count, it is fully functioning and is in good shape with only one minor cosmetic issue to note, a crack in the wood in the upper handguard.  This occured when I shot the rifle for the first time on a cold day. I contacted the importer, Keng's Firearms, and they noted it is a not a rare occurance.  These rifles have not been imported since 1989 and will NEVER be imported again.  Great investment  opportunity and AWESOME AK int erms of fit/function/ and overall product. The chinese are known for making great AK's adn their quality is much better than the Romanian Junk  (WASR 10).  

NO trades accepted and this will be a cash only sale.  I am selling to make room in my collection for other items that are wanted.  Buyer is responsible for shipping if shipping is needed and payment can be made face to face in cash or via postal MO.  Price is firm and is non-negotiable and all sales are final.

Get this rifle before further legislation makes it impossible or much harder to transfer guns/obtaint hese.  Value on these continues to rise and only has one way to go, UP."

Comes with a factory 9-round magazine with aftermarket rubber floorplate.
Includes the factory hardcase with test-fired casing.
Also includes a Fobus Roto paddle holster (right-handed, can be rotated to carry the gun at any angle you want).
It has a really nice crisp, light trigger (one of the best factory triggers I've felt).
Gun has been carried frequently, but rarely shot.
Steel frame makes it easy to keep on target during rapid fire.
Only negative is some holster wear on the parkerized finish on the slide and trigger guard.  Personally, I think holster wear just gives a gun some character.
Besides being a 9mm instead of .45 ACP, this is a standard 1911 with tactical features: extended beaver tail, ambidextrous safety, and adjustable sights."

From Glock website:
Obtaining the greatest accuracy for target shooting was the main reason for the development of the GLOCK 34 which has an extended barrel, greater slide dimensions, and unmatched reliability in a 9x19mm pistol. This highly accurate pistol has found widespread use as a competitive pistol for USPSA, IDPA, IPSC, GSSF and other sport shooting organizations."

Visit www.tanfoglio.it    WONDER FINISH is? The WONDER FINISH is TANFOGLIO'S proprietary heat treating process for steel. 
It is not a plating, so it will not separate from the base metal. This heat treating process increases the surface hardness which decreases wear and increases abrasion resistance.
The Wonder Finish process creates a self-lubricating, corrosion resistant barrier between the surface of the pistol and underlying metal that is over 12 microns deep. 
It maintains the characteristics of carbon steel for rigidity and durability with the look and corrosion resistance of stainless steel. 
This WITNESS P-Competitor ll  is chambered for the 45ACP cartridge and has a magazine capacity of 10 rounds.
The WITNESS P-Competitor ll has an overall length of 7.5"", barrel length 3.6"", width 1.4"", height 5.5"" and has a weight of 27oz.

I'm reposting this because the last person that wanted it wasn't serious about anything so once again if the same guy reads this DON'T request info on it.

Ok now that I have that off my chest, this Ballester Molina is for sale and sale only unless you have something that is equal value. It was made between 1942-1944 for the British SOE during WW2 to be used in Europe. This pistol has been graded at 85% grade which puts it at a pretty good condition to be around 70 years old. I personally love this pistol just really don't have no use for it, but also won't take low ball offers. A lot of people don't know a lot about these pistols due to the fact that they are scarce and not alot of people own them especially the British contracted ones 1-8000 made. I'm am very serious about the sale of this ballester Molina so please only serious buyers please these guns are valued at $1200 at 95% grade this doesn't meen I'm going to sell it for that send me an email telling me you offer thanks"

I am selling my Lee Enfield No4 MkI rifle.  It is chambered in 303 British.  

I have 470+ rounds for it.  There are a few surplus rounds along with a few hundred steel core rounds and around 150ish tracer rounds (Very few actually light).  There are a number of ""youth"" loads along with a few full house loads.  Most of the loads are middle of the road power.  All are separated in baggies.

It feeds from the magazine just fine and ejects brass fine as well.   The bolt is VERY smooth.  It comes with a pig sticker bayonet.  Also a rail (it bolts on and requires no drilling or tapping).  I also have 2 steel cartridge adapters for 7.62x25.  This allows you to shoot 7.62x25 tokarev ammo out of it (feels like a 22lr).  Also has the original leather sling.

With good loads in this, I have shot 6"" groups at 400 yards with the irons.  The only ""problem"" it has (as seen in the pictures) is that the front band has a screw and nut holding it on because the front band screw stripped at some point.  The stock has a little chunk taken out as well.  It is a GREAT rifle and I hate to sell it, but I need to fund another project.  

I will throw in some dies and the ammo can if necessary.

Ammo is over a buck a piece for this stuff.  So basically you are buying ammo and getting a free rifle out of the deal.




Here is my pistol I am also trying to trade and would throw in with the rifle if I am trading up.

It's in nice shape, the stock is worn like most surplus SKS's, and there is some bluing worn off the metal. But mechanically, the rifle is in excellent shape. It's been completely disassembled and gone through, and cosmoline removed. It's got a long life ahead of it. I've put maybe 100 rounds through it and not a single issue. It's built like a tank.

This SKS has a Murray's firing pin installed. For those who don't know what that is, it basically means this rifle has been modified so that it can't ""slam fire"", which is a rare but serious (and completely avoidable) problem that an SKS could develop if it gets too dirty and the firing pin sticks in the forward position. It is definitely a plus for this rifle. This has always been my ""go-to"" SKS, so I figured I should have the Murray's pin on it. 

This SKS comes with 630 rounds of Brown Bear 7.62x39 HP ammo.

I have my C&R license, which means I have to record your name, address, and DL# in my little book whenever I sell a C&R weapon, which this is. I don't like it, but it's the law.

Here is what I was recently messaged about:

""So, your trying to sell a"" plane"" SKS for $$850 ?
I have at least 1 of every SKS there is including ""K SPORTS"" parkerized and ""M"" , ""D"" , ""ND"" and Vietnam .Never heard of or seen a ""k"" so I called two other collectors who have about the same size collection to see if I have missed something.
Neither of them know of any such rifle. The "" doesn't belong on the rifle , so the serial # has been altered. So I would drop it like a hot rock.""

I've had some questions on this, the pistol is a HK MP5 clone and is no longer in production.  Matter of fact, the pistol has not been produced for several years - since the lawsuit filed by HK for infringement of the MP5 design.  All accessories for the HK MP5 pistol/rifles fit without issue and can be added easily.  The pistol shipped from the factory with the included 10rd mag.  Thanks.

There have been a lot of moving parts in the renewed debate about guns in the weeks since the mass shooting at a Newtown, Conn., school. But the more things change, the more they stay the same, in many respects. With Biden’s task force set to offer recommendations on how to best curb gun violence next Tuesday, the debate ahead is defined by a few parameters:

1. The NRA’s not budging: The nation’s largest gun rights group continues to refuse to offer up or agree to any new gun control measures. “We were disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the 2nd Amendment,” the group said after its sit-down with Biden. After calling for armed guards to be placed in every school as a means of preventing mass violence, the NRA hasn’t backed down, even in the face of some very hard pushback from gun-control advocates.

So far at least, the NRA hasn’t faced overwhelming public pressure to change its ways. Most Americans hold a favorable opinion of the group, a recent Gallup poll showed, while fewer than four-in-ten said it has too much influence, according to a Pew survey.

It’s becoming clearer that if new gun control measures are going to be signed into law, it will be done over clear objection from the NRA.

2. The Obama administration is moving swiftly ahead: Even with a renewed fiscal debate looming and battles over cabinet confirmations crowding everything else on his plate, Obama’s vow to act quickly to curb gun violence has held up. Biden’s task force is set to deliver his recommendations next Tuesday, and the proposals could be more sweeping than a renewed ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines. Biden has also suggested that the president will use executive action if necessary.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) suggested on Sunday that the debate about guns must take a back seat to the country’s immediate fiscal matters, like the nation’s debt. “None of these issues, I think, will have the kind of priority that spending and debt are going to have over the next two or three months,” McConnell said on ABC News’s “This Week.”

But once Biden offers his group’s recommendations, it’s difficult to imagine Obama not addressing them quickly. The president recently said he will “not be putting off” gun control. And Obama has already said he backs reinstating the ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, which key lawmakers have promised to press for on Capitol Hill.

3. New voices in an old debate: If there’s one thing that’s shifted where other things have remained constant, its the rise of new groups that stand to give financial and political muscle to gun control advocates.

Former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her husband, Mark Kelly, have already picked up big donations for their new PAC. And New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s super PAC made its mark on the issue of gun control in the 2012 election. NRA opposition groups could be on the verge of becoming as powerful as ever.

4. Consensus will be (very) difficult: Dealing with guns is a complex proposition that can’t be broken down along party lines. There are regional factors that must also be taken under consideration. And the millions of dollars being tossed around by outside groups further complicates the picture. Check out the number of Senate Democrats with high marks from the NRA in the Senate. Then, look at the GOP-controlled House that has been stubborn with its own leader. Passing new laws won’t be easy.

Obama recently said he will be putting his “full weight” behind gun control measures. His opponents can be expected to do the same in in opposition. If a deal is reached, it may involve the formation of unlikely alliances like one between Wal-Mart and the White House, for example."

Base rifle is a DPMS Panther Oracle.  It's got a buncha goodies added to it.  Rifle is in good condition and comes with some of the factory stuff (charging handle, safety selector, flash hider, trigger guard; I don't have the A2 grip or handguards).

Additional stuff installed:
Magpul CTR Stock (FDE)
Magpul MBUS flip-up rear sight
Magpul MOE enhanced trigger guard (black)
Magpul AFG1 (FDE)
Magpul MIAD grip (FDE) with AA/AAA battery grip core
Magpul low-profile rail ladder covers (FDE) trimmed to fit.
4 x Magpul PMAG (30 rd, M2 / FDE)
Daniel Defense EZ Car. 7.0 quad-rail handguard
Battle Arms Development Ambidextrous Safety Selector (BADASS)
Yankee Hill Phantom flash hider (has a small scratch from installation)
Bravo Company Gunfighter Mod4 Charging Handle
Yankee Hill Gas Block/Flip Up Hooded Front Sight w/ bottom rail

Included is a sturdy black nylon 38"" tactical rifle bag; perfect fit for this particular rifle, too.  It has 4 velcro mag pockets and a long pouch for additional stuff.

If you need optics with it is well, I have a nearly unused EOTech 512 (AA batteries) sight along with a Primary Arms Long-Eye-Relief 3x magnifier.  Amazingly sweet combo.  The EOTech has seen less than an hour of run time. Asking $500 as these are nearly brand new.  Not selling this separately at this time; only with the rifle. 

Buyer covers shipping and any required transfer fees if out of state.  If shipping is necessary, I'd be shipping through my local gun shop."
