The L5AWM is the only HYBRID AR magazine available today, featuring the best characteristics of Polymer and Steel magazine designs. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.

The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few.

""Back when everyone thought that the pump action shotgun couldn’t be improved, the Benelli Nova Pump proved otherwise. Completely original and innovative, the 12-gauge pump incorporates a polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics make the gun not only pleasing to look at, but a delight to hold and handle. Distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and forend in place of conventional checkering provides a positive gripping surface and complements the innovative engineering of the Nova Pump. With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova 12-gauge shotgun handles anything from target loads to 3-1/2 Inch magnums. 26 Inch' Barrel. Black Synthetic finish."""

All of the serial numbers match, down to the screws.

I'm pretty sure it hasn't been shot in decades, seeing as how I just found out about this gun when I acquired it. It does have some nicks and scratches, but they are mostly on the wood. The barrel and receiver look to be in really good condition, especially for it's age. It does have the crack on the foregrip that pretty much all the old a-5 16's have because the weakness of the spring. $600 OBO. I tried to show the area with the most nicks and scratches on the last 2 pictures on the foregrip. Other than that, just a few spots here and there. Not much though."

Rifle has around 500 rounds through it, so there's a bit of wear and tear on the operating parts but nothing out of the ordinary. If you want interior detail shots or alternate angles, feel free to ask.

The aftermarket parts are as follows:

-US-made KVAR polymer stock w/ cleaning kit trapdoor
-Ergo pistol grip
-Tapco G2 fire control group
-Bullet guide installed to allow feeding from traditional AK magazines
-Uninssued Bulgarian milsurp polymer handguard (US-made heat shield) mounted using US-made handguard retainer
-UltimAK railed gas tube for long eye relief scopes and electronic sights

The five magazines are four Romanian 30rd mil-surp steel magazines in fair to good condition (just got them a few weeks ago and cleaned them up) as well as the stock Saiga 10rd magazine. While proprietary 30rd Saiga magazines (like those made by SGM/Surefire) have spotty reliability now that a bullet guide has been installed, the 10rd mag still feeds great and is useful for benchrest shooting.

The rifle can ship via UPS to a local FFL of your choice, shipping is included in the price. If you're in my state, a face-to-face might be possible, but we'd have to work out the feasibility and the terms. I would prefer the FFL shipment.

In addition to everything listed above, the rifle also comes with a NcStar soft case with five mag pouches, a bare-bones Blackhawk two-point sling, a UTG front sight tool, the stock Saiga cleaning rod, and the stock Saiga cleaning kit (mounted within the stock's trapdoor mount). The rifle was cleaned prior to listing."

The paint is done with Duracoat, on the right side of the rear action you can see where brass has hit and chipped the paint, some on the bolt body, some wear by the bolt knob and a little at the end of the barrel.

There would be no exemptions and no grandfathering. You would have a very short window to turn in your guns to the State Police to avoid prosecution.”

Q: To whom may an unlicensed person transfer firearms under the GCA?
A person may sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of his State, if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under Federal law. A person may loan or rent a firearm to a resident of any State for temporary use for lawful sporting purposes, if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under Federal law. A person may sell or transfer a firearm to a licensee in any State. However, a firearm other than a curio or relic may not be transferred interstate to a licensed collector.

I am selling this fine rifle because I only bow hunt now and do not use it.  The rifle has a detachable 5 round box magazine, that is flush with the stock when inserted.   The bolt acts on a 70 degree turn to allow the use of a scope. Another feature of this gun I enjoy is that the safety is right on the tang/thumb rest for easy access for left and right handed shooters.  This would be a great hunting rifle or long range target rifle.  There are few calabers that you can easily get such a wide range of ammunition for.  The gun also come with a cabelas scope and a ruger stock pouch/ammo holder. I will also throw in a box of ammo.

The best two words to describe our AK 30rd magazine: ""rugged"" and ""reliable."" The reinforced composite material prevents corrosion while the heavy duty spring and anti-tilt follower ensure that every round will feed perfectly. Fits in the AK-47 using 7.62 x 39mm ammunition. When your Kalashnikov is thirsting for a magazine that can handle a beating, no questions asked, the INTRAFUSE® 30rd AK Magazine is the only logical choice. Not to mention that this magazine counts as 3 U.S. 922r compliant parts."

 This is an original Yugoslavian Military factory Short Barreled AK47 with a 10.5 inch barrel with a 5.5inch spot welded hollow horn style flash hider to make it 16inch legal rifle without having to obtain an SBR stamp first. It can be removed and the original short horn flash hider re-enstalled once you obtain your tax stamp for an SBR weapon. This is truely a collectors AK47 and the absolute rarest of the Yugo factory made Short Barreled AK47 and it's NEW. Look around you will not be able to find one like this anywhere! This is not a cheapo Romainian WASR 10/63 AK or Chineese Norinco made AK crap that people here are asking tripple price for...this is the absolute best AK47 made next to an original Russian made AK!! I had two of them...this is my last one!

*Note* The last picture only shows what it would look like as it was originally made from the factory as an SBR (Short Barreled Rilfe) If you were to buy one already as an SBR you would have to wait 8 months for the stamp before you could even take possession of it! with mine you can buy it now, take possession of it, shoot it, enjoy it, and at your leasure get you tax stamp to make it an SBR if you choose to!

The stock has a small crack in it but its all working great and no rust on either gun. The double barrel needs a spring for one side to fire. The spring is broke Inside that brings the hammer forward when you pull the trigger. Where the double barrel breaks down it is a little but loose but there are screws to tighten it I have just only used it for decoration so I never have fixed it. I just fired it last night for the first time in years for New Years and it kicks hard but shoots great. I'm looking to sell or trade. I am looking for semi auto rifles, pistols, and basically any types of guns. I love buying, selling and trading. I love just having a new different gun. These guns are worth a lot if you find the right collector. My grandfather gave me these guns and I'm just ready to get something new. I love Sks, ak-47 ect. Cash or trade is fine with me. Can sell separate or together. Text Derek at REDACTED."

Rifle sights are fixed and has the proper conversion indicating stamp of 7.92 on the rear sight.The rifle has a 17 inch barrel and is 36 inches from barrel to buttstock.The bayonet lug is there.The only thing missing is the original cleaning rod which screws under the barrel.You can find this at numrich gun parts.The rifle is a fine shooter and functions as it should, however the finish,as can be expected with a gun of this age is heavily worn.The stock has a few dings here and there, but no large cracks or chips missing. Rifle comes with one steel 5 round Mannlincher style clip. Additional pics can be emailed.Be sure to check out my preban Ruger 10/22 listing and my Savage 430 listing as well. Thanks for looking! A little info on the legals as far as transfer of ownership goes.The following is an excerpt taken directly from the BATF website.
Q: To whom may an unlicensed person transfer firearms under the GCA?
A person may sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of his State, if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under Federal law. A person may loan or rent a firearm to a resident of any State for temporary use for lawful sporting purposes, if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under Federal law. A person may sell or transfer a firearm to a licensee in any State. However, a firearm other than a curio or relic may not be transferred interstate to a licensed collector.
