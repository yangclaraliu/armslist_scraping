BUCK GOLD is the culmination of years of improvements to Millett's 30mm target and varmint scopes. Premium glass provides exceptional clarity and fully multi-coated optics assure maximum light transmission for excellent image quality in low-light conditions. A one-piece tube with dry nitrogen purging creates a rugged design with superior waterproof integrity.

·	Heavy-duty, one-piece main tube, provides the foundation for precise lens alignment and other components.

·	Reinforced variable power zoom ring serves to seal and support the eyepiece securely.
·	Our special sealing and purge methods for dry nitrogen fill include internal moisture removal paths in the eyepiece. The use of water-resistant sealants, synthetic grease and secure O-ring seals protect against fogging over the life of the scope.
·	Unique coil spring system applies uniform pressure to the zoom assembly throughout the windage & elevation adjustment range.
·	Resettable dials are provided in both windage and elevation adjustments to retain sight calibration and easy return to zero.
·	Finger-touch controls eliminate the need for coin slots. The fine clicks are graduated to produce 1/4 minute of angle corrections.

It comes with Hogue grips, EIGHT 15 round mags and a two 32 round extended magazines.
I'll throw in 250 rounds of Fiocchi 9mm hollowpoints for the right deal.
Very nice gun, light recoil, a couple of scratches and nicks from service wear but it's still a damn good gun and has plenty of life left in it.
Has about 400 rounds through it since I bought it brand new, it has served as a home defense gun/farm gun for the last 2 years and a backup to my Sig P226 since I became base security up at Whiteman AFB back in 2009.

This thing is a TANK, will eat up any ammo you put in it, you can chuck it, stomp on it, drown it, cake it in mud and throw it under a car tire and have it ran over (I've done it by accident) and this thing won't quit on you.

This gun hasn't been through all of the above except for the car and mud part, but it's very tough and reliable, no dents or warping from the car incident, I can guarantee it will never fail you when you need it, it has never failed me in the 5 years I've owned it."

The only thing keeping this gun from 100% is a couple of VERY VERY MINOR blemishes (holster wear it seems) on the very tips of the accessory rail and 1 at the front of the trigger guard. 

You wont even see them unless you specifically look for them as they are very small / minor.

The firearm comes w/ 4 mags

1 6-rd
1 7-rd
2 8-rd

Comes with ammo: 1 box (50rds) WWB 124gr FMJ and 1 box (25 rds) Winchester Supreme Elite PDX1 124gr JHP (new generation self defense ammo)

The gun has been fired about 200-250 times, I am the 2nd owner and I have ALL of the paperwork for the firearm (the bill of sale from my acquisition as well as the original owners receipts,purchase info,rebate cards and all manuals which he included in our deal)

The firearm comes with the factory aluminum carrying case (has lite scratches all over the case/box - none major)

The gun is very nice however I never use it and with its collectible status it is not something I want to carry and get it all worn. (There were only 1000 of these made, this one has a 2-digit serial number)

These are currently listed on Gunbroker.com from 900-1100 USD. I honestly to believe that is a bit.....excessive... and with the minor wear on mine I am willing to go 650 or trade (MAY negotiate)

A valid VA drivers license and swap of a Bill of Sale IS REQUIRED

I am in Nelson County and Charlottesville,va daily (live in Nelson) but may travel (an hour or so) depending on the offer.

Some bluing has worn at the crown, on the bands, and on the top of the receiver (I believe) and there is some minor light pitting on the receiver but no rust.  The previous owner attached a sling mount and then removed it and and filled it in.  I would put the bluing at around 80-90%.  The pictures of the receiver are a bit deceiving--there is gun oil on, making it look like the bluing has worn off when that is not the case.

This is a high quality Norinco AK47 with proper wood furniture and bakalite handle - A classic icon of Russian weaponry!

These are not the cheap Romanian versions you see flooding the market today. Therefore, they hold their value and are of very high quality (hence the reason Norinco has several contracts with western governments to provide firearms).

What an amazing gun. Fires like a dream. I was able to achieve a 3 in. spread at 150m (which is superb for an AK47). In great condition, fired <200 rounds total.

I've shot only about 70 rounds through her--all fed flawlessly.  She's not even all the way broken in yet!  For all intents and purposes, this is a brand new gun.  There is a slight scuff near the rear sight--barely even noticeable.  After firing, I field stripped and cleaned it thoroughly.

Second:
Ruger 10/22T – used, but not abused – stock and barrel are very nearly perfect, only signs of external wear are on the scope mount (which is included) and a small mark at the very tip of the barrel. Also very clean, a true tack driver! Add a scope and you are ready to go! Includes attached scope mount and one 10round magazine.
