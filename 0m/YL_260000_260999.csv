BRAND NEW IN BOX!!!!
Davidson's Lifetime replacement warranty. 3% cc fee. RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS Calibers: Target Carbine Weight unloaded (no magazine): 11.3 lbs 8.1 lbs Length: 40"" 26"" Barrel length: 32"" 18"" Magazine: 10 or 20 FAL Practical range: 1200m 600m The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*. Longer barrel lengths of 24"", 26"" and 32"" will be available in the future. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.

Up for sale is my Kriss Super V.  This gun shoots .45ACP.  Included in with the firearm is the forward grip with the spring loaded bi-pod.  Also included is a red-dot sighting system, already sighted for 50 yards.  This includes 1 standard magazine and an extended brand new/never used 30 round magazine.  The gun has only had 300 rounds fired through it.  I challenge you to find one anywhere near this price in this condition.

If you have never had the pleasure of firing a Kriss Super V, it has the pivoting bolt, which slides down rather than back, producing nearly zero recoil and muzzle raise.  The Kriss (which fires a .45ACP round) has 60% less recoil and 90% less muzzle raise than a H&K MP5 (which fires a the smaller 9mm round).  The charging handle also does not slide back with the bolt.  Since it remains stationary, it also adds to the smoothness of the rifle.  You can just put it on your target, unload the magazine and the gun will stay right in place.

I can provide my original receipt with this purchase to prove ownership.  I really need a quick sale and will be posting this at a little over $500 less than what I have invested in the gun.  

Please call me with any questions or would like to see the rifle.  Willing to travel within reason to meet you FTF.

This has a magnum receiver, will shoot 3"" shells, and has the all metal trigger plate assembly, not the newer polymer ones. It has wood stock/forend and they are nice condition, has chrome breech bolt assembly. The barrel is a new Mossberg manufactured 18.5"" Cylinder bore, 2 3/4"" & 3"" chambered (I gave the original barrel away to a friend who hunts w/a Wingmaster), and the magazine extension is a 2 round Scattergun Technologies extension. The shotgun also has a new sling, will come with the original magazine tube spring and magazine spring retainer as well as an extra magazine cap (that came with the sling) and original follower (has the new high vis one that came with the Scattergun Technologies mag extension in it now). 

The receiver was refinished with Aluma-Hyde II, Dark Parkerizing Gray a while back. Overall the shotgun is in good-very good shape, but it's a shooter so it's not mint. It's a solid home defense shotgun and would make a great tactical shotgun with new furniture. To get you started in that direction, I have a brand new Elite Tactical Advantages S2AR grip adapter which allows you to attach any standard AR grip, buffer tube and stock, putting the stock in direct line w/the barrel so you can have the same ergonomics as an AR platform and make use of recoil reducing stocks/buffer systems.

Send your offer along with a pic and your email address/or phone #. I'll try to get back to everyone, if I can't, I apologize. If the add is up, I still have it."

The TriNyte System takes firearm protection further than it’s ever been before by using proven corrosion-fighting materials and an innovative, state-of-the-art application process. The result is a finish that provides scratch and corrosion resistance far superior to stainless steel alone and better than any other gun on the market.
Designed for shooters by shooters, the Model 700 XCR is built for superior handling in adverse conditions. Its feature laden synthetic stock is not only stylish and comfortable, but a technological marvel. Features patented rubber overmolding technology from Hogue – a revolutionary technique incorporated into the grip and fore-end areas to provide the surest grip even in the slickest environments. The new standard in rugged durability, the Model 700 XCR™ Xtreme Conditions Rifle will have you delivering your appointed rounds while the others stay home. The 7mm-08 weighs in at 7.25 pounds.
Key Features:
• Proprietary TriNyte™ Corrosion Control System provides unprecedented corrosion resistance
New stock featuring patented rubber overmolding technology from Hogue on grip and fore-end areas and swivel studs
• Features a 24"" clean barrel
• Drilled and tapped for scope mounts
• Receiver machined from solid-steel bar stock resulting in uniformity and strength
• Cylindrical receiver design provides a solid bedding area in the stock for consistent shot placement
• Recessed bolt face locks up inside the counter-bored breech of the barrel which is surrounded by the receiver, forming “three-rings-of-steel” enclosing the cartridge case head for unparalleled strength
• Integral extractor is set in a groove inside the rim of the bolt face, uniformly supporting the cartridge head
• New X-Mark Pro Trigger on select models – featuring super-tight tolerances and mirror-like surface finishes, it breaks like glass and is adjustable for trigger pull weight.

Brand new in box and never has been shot, except at the factory. I will throw in a pair of medium, matte black, Leupold 1 inch scope rings and 50 pieces of once fired Remington 7mm-08 brass.  BIPOD NOT INCLUDED

I have got some questions regarding this, so here it goes:

Q: Do I have any communicable disease(s)
A: NO

Q: Will I take $300 because that is how much it will cost you after your $1K deductible?
A: NO (I am offering this to you at $550 vs $1300your insurance company charges you.)

Q: (this was a good one).  What kind of surgery for SleepApnea did I opt for?
A: this was a progression of my sleep apnea battle thus far:  quit smoking, loose weight, C-pap/biPAP, sleep appliance (dentist makes you this guard to sleep with) , now, if a current sleep appliance does NOT work in the long run - I will be going for the Pillar procedure.  I was not a good candidate for any other surgeries thus far (Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, Maxillomandibular advancement or Tracheostomy).


This machine is basically new. I could not use a machine and chose to have a surgery for my sleep apnea. The machine has less than 2 hours use on it. Asking $550 ('gift' p@yP@l or a USPS money order) or a firearm trade (for a right trade can meet within a 50miles radius from Zip Code 54914 (appleton WI)), which is is about half of what it costs for a base (unlike this deluxe one) model.

The Respironics BiPAP Auto M Series combines auto adjusting pressure delivery with the breath-by-breath pressure relief of Bi-Flex. Machine has Encore Pro SmartCard technology. Bi-Flex softens airflow at inhalation and exhalation, making breathing more natural and comfortable for patients. In Bi-Flex mode, patient-adjustable pressure relief is provided at the critical stages. BiPAP Auto M Series Bi-Flex Humidifer uses Bi-Flex pressure relief technology to provide CPAP humidifier therapy. This technology offers pressure relief at inhalation and exhalation to make BiPAP therapy more like natural breathing. By tracking each breath, Bi-Flex delivers pressure relief at three critical points in the breathing cycle: the transition from exhalation to inhalation, the transition from inhalation to exhalation and during exhalation.

Little background on the gun:

In the 1990, after the excessive trials, South Korean army adopted the first domestically designed 9mm pistol, the K5. Developed and manufactured in Korea by the Daewoo Precision Industries branch of the Daewoo Corporation, the K5 pistol is now standard sidearm of the armed forces of South Korea.  The basic 9mm K5 is sold as Daewoo DP-51, its compact variant is sold as DP-51c, and the variant in the .40SW is sold as DH-40. These pistols are well made and shoot well.

Daewoo K5 / DP51 pistol is short recoil operated, locked breech weapon. It uses a conventional Browning-type locking system, with two lugs on the barrel engaging cuts inside the slide. Locking and unlocking is controlled by the cam-shaped lug at the bottom of the barrel. Frame of the pistol is made from aluminum alloy; all other parts are made from steel. Trigger is of “triple action” type. This means that other than traditional double or single action fire modes it has “fast action” mode, apparently borrowed from FN’s GP “Fast Action” pistol. In this mode hammer is cocked by the cycle of the slide, then it is pushed forward by the pressure on the hammer head. In this position, the main spring remains cocked, so only light pressure on the trigger is necessary to recock the hammer and fire the gun in the “double action manner”. Or, alternatively, hammer can be recocked manually to be fired in single action for maximum first-shot accuracy. Sights are fixed, with the rear sight dovetailed to the slide. Magazines are of double stack type; proprietary magazines hold 13 rounds, but DP-51 also can use Smith-Wesson 5906 magazines, which will slightly protrude from the bottom of the grip."

This is basically a cz75 for cheaper and is every bit as accurate. Tangfolio is the actual gun maker, a well known Italian gun manufacturer . EAA just imports them into the US. Before 2005 , EAA imported two frame sizes of the witness, the small and large frame. After 2005 they stopped importing the small frame and only imported the large frame. This is the classic small frame which they started importing again due to customer demands for the old small frame, but they only import like 2000 a year so its fairly rare. The small frame is the same size as the cz75 and fits people with medium to small hands better like myself. Ok, back to the gun , it is in excellent shape(like new) and shoots like a dream. I just ordered a 3rd magazine for it so one mag hasnt been used at all. I am firm at $365 for this gun. You cant find them and where else can you get a legendary cz75 like steel frame gun for $365? This gun can be carried cocked and locked just like the famous 1911 and many consider it the 1911 of europe. Only trades I will consider would be for a kahr 9mm  as I am getting my concealed carry.

Victories were produced for the ""Lend Lease"" program during WWII and shipped to Australia, New Zealand, Britain and other allied countries as well as to defense contractors in the US for security personnel.

This particular revolver was produced in late 1943 or early 1944 and has been refinished in nickel with white grips and modified to fire the S&W 38 special ctg. It will now fire both the 38 S&W and the 38 S&W special cartridge.

Here are the markings;

Bottom of barrel; V2679xx
Left side of barrel; Smith & Wesson
Right side of bbl; 38 S&W CTG then a different stamp; SPECIAL
Above the trigger guard on right side; Made in USA
Right side plate; S&W logo stamp
Bottom of butt; V2679xx
Rear of cylinder; V2679xx
Crane; N 21359 21359
There are no other marks, proof marks or US Property marks.
These numbers mean that all the parts are original to this gun.

The nickel is OK, some minor scratches but on the right side it looks like road rash. The cylinder has some moderate scratches and the end of the barrel has some chips in the nickel. The lanyard ring hole on the butt is apparant where it was filled before refinish.

The timing seems good, the lock up is tight and the trigger is wonderful(it is a S&W after all).

I have fired 38 special rounds in this revolver and it is an easy to shoot quality S&W revolver and would make a great inexpensive home defense weapon for the person who wants something less complicated than a semi-auto. And it has some historical significance."

 This is a great example of one of the more sought after SKS rifles. When I first got into military type rifles I was more into SKS and AK type variants .

Early Chinese manufactured SKS's were stamped with a 26 inside a Triangle and  Chinese characters which translated to Type 56, the model designation of the Chinese SKS. Note the orientation of these characters / proof marks. These were built in the only Russian supervised arsenal located at the Jianshe armory.

There's 400 rounds total, and at $150 would be about 38 cents a round. This also works out to 8 boxes at about $18.75 each.

To illustrate:

Cabella's currently sells a bulk pack of 300 Winchester .45 for $144.99 and about 50 cents a round. Or 6 boxes of 50 at $24.17 a box.

This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. I have much more invested in this weapon than my asking price."
