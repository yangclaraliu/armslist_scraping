Comes with the factory magazine and all of the breakdown tools that came with the weapon. Also this gun has a different size grip back for larger or smaller hands, also two different front sight tips for elevation adjustments. This gun is very accurate and reliable, I have read forums where people have issues with failed feeds and ejection problems mine hasn't had those issues. Also people say they can only get good results using CCI ammo. I have put a mix of all .22 ammo through it and it seems to handle them all well. As with any .22 they get dirty and then have some ejection issues, but just a quick swipe with a brush and your back firing. I am selling this one to buy my daughter either a pink Walther P-22 or a mosquito (pink) furthermore she likes the Ruger SR22 better for grip purposes so I would consider trades for the three weapons I mentioned. Also best offer will be considered as well.

This rifle is super clean. Field stripping it and inspecting the hammer showed that it had almost no finish wear from bolt travel. I've put about 300 rounds through it since acquiring it. Serial is SP137***. I swapped the A1 birdcage muzzle device for a three-prong and replaced the hammer and trigger springs. Both of these mods are of course fully reversible with a few minutes of work and the original parts are included. I repeat: all of the original parts are here! The spring replacement brought the trigger pull down from 8 lbs to about 5.5 lbs with a crisp, clean break. If you get the insatiable urge to put a crazy match trigger in there, it takes standard modern small trigger pins, so your Geisseles and Timneys and such will drop right in. Also included is its sling, an M7 bayonet with M8 sheath, the unmarked black 30rd mag it came to me with, and two gray USGI 20rd mags marked Adventure Line Mfg Co Inc on the floorplates.

I'm in Plano, TX just off 75 and am primarily available at mornings or late evenings on weekdays, or on Sundays. I will ship within the continental United States for an additional $35.

Selling a Springfield Armory 1911 Loaded with parkerized finish. Includes the original case and standard holster, dual mag carrier, manual/papers, cleaning brush and factory 7 round magazine. Features Trijicon Night Sights (2009) which are still very bright. Front slide serrations, stainless barrel, beaver tail grip safety and a Series 70 Firing Pin.

However, the full length guide rod and ILS (Internal Locking System) main spring housing have been done away with by the previous owner. These were the main features that attracted me to it! In thier place are a Wilson Combat G.I. Guide Rod and Plug (Stainless) and a Wilson Combat Flat Main Spring Housing (w/ no ILS crud) and I believe a Wilson Combat Ambi Thumb Safety.

Included FOR FREE are a stainless Wilson Combat Bushing (if you want it to match the barrel and plug), a Wilson Combat Slide stop (parkerized) and a Wilson Combat G.I. Thumb Safety (stainless steel).

Right now it is wearing black rubber Pachmyer Grips (included) but the picture shows the original wood grips, which are also included. I will also throw in 2x Kimber Kim Pro Tac Magazines (stainless, 8 round capacity) into the package.

I am the second owner. I do not have the original parts as they were not included. The previous owner and I have both sent a total of about 650 rounds down the pipe. It is still in great condition with only minor wear on the lower front of the slide a small blemish on the lower front of the frame. Other than that, the weapon is in great shooting condition!

Would like to sell them as a set but individually is ok. Built them and now they sit. So i would like someone to get some use out of them. If u have a spouse or child who is recoil shy THIS is the gun for you. Both guns kick as much as a .22 LR. No joke. You can shoot them before you buy them. They have seen about 50rds each.

No Trades on this guys- unless its for a center console boat, or nicer bass boat.

The scope is worth about $100. I used this .22 a lot when I was a teenager, but cleaned it thoroughly every time. I also broke it in correctly (shoot a bullet, clean, shoot a bullet clean, etc). Although it has been shot a lot, I can tell you I could cut a playing card in half at 75 yards. Great gun to shoot. It cycles long rifles, longs, and shorts. It has the usual wear that a well used gun would have.  There is a dent in the top elevation knob housing on the scope. I can e-mail many more pictures if you would like. I love this gun, but it has been sitting in my safe for too long."

Rough condition okay as long as bore and crown(counter-bore OK) are serviceable. 

I would also possibly be interested in beater M91/30s at beater prices(as long as bore is okay), and Mosin Nagants that have been ""sporterized"" and are still C&R eligible(modified the year of or prior to 1961). An M44 carbine, while not optimal, would also be considered if the condition and price are right. A M91/59 would work as well. I'm not interested in any Finnish models or captures unless it has already been sporterized pre-'61. A type 53 Chinese Mosin Nagant would also be considered.

Face To Face, cash and carry preferred as this is legal for C&R eligible longarms in CA and saves much time and money. I am willing to meet someplace part way, and I have no issues providing photocopy of ID and/or signed statement of legal eligibility to purchase firearms. This is not my 1st firearms purchase in CA, just have been having severe issues in sourcing an M38 or any reasonably priced M-N carbine.

Looking to spend $100-150 OBO depending on condition, etc.

If you know of one of these rifles at a local shop for a reasonable price, have one to offer yourself, or know someone who does, please contact me using the ""contact buyer"" button.

LWRC Base Model Semi-automatic 556NATO 16"" Piston, Black 6 Position Collapsible Stock ,Four Rail Handguard Hammer Forged Barrel, 30Rd Pmag, Gas Piston, Front/Rear Flip Sights, BM6A2R5B16 Description: The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

I have heard that it goes away in time, but like I said, there's only been 20 rounds through it, so I wouldn't know.

I've got a stamped Vector arms AK 47, if you don't know anything about them do some research, these are upper end AK rifles. I am putting a feeler out for trade offers. This gun has some wear on the side where the safety slides, and a FEW light handling marks, has seen 300 rounds. 
I am looking for a 20 inch AR flat top with a railed forend, or a Dissapator. If you have a nice looking M4, I MAY consider it. I'm not looking for any thrown together AR, has to be factory. I don't NEED to sell this, or trade it, just would like to have something different and add 1 more AR.

I am in Northern Indiana and want to keep the trades up this way, I will not travel to Indy so don't waste your time.
