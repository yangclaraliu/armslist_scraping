28,http://www.armslist.com/posts/690028,For Sale:  Tactical Rifles Custom Built Bolt Action 7.62/.308 NATO Rifle,"Northern Hamilton County, Indianapolis, Indiana","$ 3,999","Listed On: Thursday, December 13, 2012",Rifles,no type,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Bolt Action,no type,"Tactical Rifles Custom Built Bolt Action 7.62/.308 NATO Rifle. Well, let me start by saying that this rifle is just for those who are REALLY serious about and love perfection in firearms. This rifle utilizes the short-throw Remington 700 action for many good reasons. This universally accepted, tried and tested action, is trued and fully accurized to provide a fundamentally sound, integral component of the weapon system on this gun. From there, everything only gets better. It has a custom match-grade bull barrel that is no bull. An Accuracy International chassis designed by the leading rifle designers across the pond whose leader also happens to be an Olympic Gold Medal winner in marksmanship. The solid aluminum A.I. block chassis is utilized to provide the ultimate in stability and is in use worldwide. Ergonomically designed, the stock can be tailored with the use of spacers to universally accommodate any dedicated marksman. A Nightforce 5.5-22x56 NXS (2012 MSRP: $2,107) with Mil-Dot Reticle sits on top like a crown on a king. And a 1913 MIL-STD ""picatinny"" rail sits underneath. And the weapon sports a Parker Hale bipod up front. This Parker Hale is not a copy, but the real thing. Very hard to obtain. Very expensive. You can track targets in both planes without stressing position, unlike Harris or any of the other pretend bipods. It is the favorite bipod of many professionals and is standard issue for the British Army & Royal Marine snipers. Tactical Rifles of Dade City, Florida, built this gun and have an enviable and excellent reputation of “doing it right”. If you go to their web site, you will see no listed prices because they build every gun to each customer’s specifications. While you are there, read the “Accuracy Guarantee” section, just to whet your appetite. My Tactical L.R. 7.62 NATO rifle, the same one you see pictured below, is a prime example of this kind of attention to detail and applied gunsmithing knowledge. This Tactical L.R. 7.62 NATO is designed for precision marksmen, by professional gunsmiths. The rifle comes with one Accuracy International 5-round detachable magazine from the shop but I have added 2 additional 5-round and 2 extra 10-round magazines to this package. The rifle, of course, comes with the original Hardigg Storm case. All rifles built by Tactical Rifles are guaranteed to shoot ½ inch 100 yard groups or they never leave the shop. The .308 Winchester cartridge has won more benchrest matches than any other above the 6mm caliber, and continues to win more Hunter class benchrest matches than all other cartridges combined. The .308 is also one of the most popular big game and military rounds, not only in the U.S. but in many other countries as well. And .308 Match ammo is relative inexpensive and readily available. The best part? This lovely rifle has only been fired twice – three rounds at the factory to prove its ½ MOA guarantee - and three more which I fired personally to test and confirm that very same claim. As you might imagine, this rifle is in like new condition. My goal was to provide the ultimate and unique tactical weapon system in .308. And it can now be yours. No trades. Firm price. Personal pickup. And cash only. $3,999. And you won’t have to wait 6 months for it like I did!"

For sale is a brand new Beretta Tomcat 3032. This gun hasn't been fired. I ordered this gun a week ago and just picked it up Wednesday. I have had a deposit on a Kel-Tec PMR30 for about 4 months and they called me Tuesday. I can't keep both guns.  I have other defense guns, so I am keeping the PMR30.
This gun will be perfect for a man or woman wanting a total concealment pistol. 
It includes , Beretta gun box and plastic case, magazine all paperwork and lock. I'm also throwing in free, an unopened box of ammo.
The retail price of this gun is between $380 and $430, plus tax. 
You can save big by buying today, only $300.
As I said I just got the gun, so the picture is a facsimile. 
This gun is a top quality gun, so it won't last long at this price. 
Please call Bob Jones if you want to see this gun. REDACTED.
Thank you,

From Beretta website:
3032 TOMCAT. EXCELLENT POWER VS WEIGHT.
Stopping power, concealability and lightweight – that’s what the double-action Tomcat is all about. Using 60-grain .32 ACP (7.65 mm) hollow-point ammunition, this latest addition to Beretta’s small frame collection provides firepower equalling the punch of a .380 (9mm Short). Yet, all this serious capability is packed into a compact, lightweight 4.9” (125 mm), 14.5 ounce (400 gr.) package. A drift-adjustable rear sight provides for superior accuracy.
Beretta Tomcat SA/SO SA/DA, semi-auto. Plastic grips. Straight blowback system. Tip-up barrel. Fixed blade front sight. Drift adjustable rear sight. Thumb-operated safety mounted on left side of frame. OAL: 5""."

I have a semi auto 1919a4 with an Emory Jones spade grip Crankfire. It's made from an Israeli .308 kit, built with a Dixon machine RSP and KMP internals. It comes with 3 cloth belts and 100 links with a starter tab.

The Crankfire is a rare Emory Jones 6 lobed Spadegrip. I replaced the crank handle with a larger wooden handle. 

I never had it parkerized after it was built because I never thought I'd sell it. It's the queen of my collection and I thought I'd pass it onto my daughter, but now I have to sell it in order to feed her. I know what this assembly is worth and have priced it accordingly. No tire kickers or lowballers, but I will entertain reasonable offers. A face to face sale will gain you negotiating leverage, as I would rather not have to hassle with shipping it if I don't have to. I live in Beloit, but work in Madison, so I could deliver it anywhere along there."

I am including 2 extra magazines and a leather twin magazine holder (does not fit my glock clips). I will also include a somewhat worn nylon holster which works well as a concealed holster. I have fired the weapon monthly since June 2012 and it performs well. I have polished the seer to smooth the heavy trigger pull a bit and polished the slide externally for appearance. I also polished the contact points of the barrel and the inner slide to smooth out the overall operation. I put a high-viz sight on the front and centered the stock rear sight with a laser bore sight tool and have verified that it shoots where you point it. For a basic home defense weapon this firearm is more than adequate. The heavy trigger is a safety in itself as it will fire if a round is chambered since there are no physical safeties (similar to a Glock 19 in parts and design). The ergonomic handle is excellent for larger hands. I have the original box as well. Only misfired twice since I owned it and always with crappy range ammo. Even the cheapest walmart ammo can be fired rapidly with no misfires. No ammo included. 

TO VERIFY THE LEGALITY OF THE SALE I WILL ONLY SELL TO INDIVIDUALS WITH A CURRENT DCJS ID SHOWING THE ARMED ENDORSEMENT or other law enforcement officers with verifiable identification. NOT FOR SALE TO NON-DCJS CERTIFIED or NON-LAW ENFORCEMENT citizens. The gun itself goes for $300 new. Each mag is worth about $50 and the mag holster is worth another $40. Considering that it is used, though in excellent condition, it would be worth $400 used."

So few of these fine pistols came into the United States, there’s just not much written about them. I will write what I know about this one, including its measurements, and maybe someone will cough us up a good Wiki or High Road article on them. Manufacturer, is Vincenzo Bernardelli, Gardone, VT, Italy; and that company folded its equipment and moved to Turkey beginning around 2002. This specimen of the PO 18S has an Italian B D date code, manufactured 1994. The PO 18 was briefly imported into the US in severely limited quantities from 1985 until 1995, all the last ones being 10 shot. Type is a traditional double action automatic; it will fire double action safety off only from a resting hammer position. It will also engage on safe carry single action, cocked and locked. Every shot after the first shot is single action from a cocked hammer; the only truly safe way to decock is to remove the magazine, eject the chamber round, and let the hammer down with the trigger. The cocked-and-locked position is appealing to many of us, and that is the main reason, apart from Israeli familiarity with Bernardelli quality, that this pistol served and protected our Israeli friends from its issue date until fairly recently with the Mishteret Y’Israel, the Israeli Civilian Police in the Jerusalem District.  The hard satin chrome finish is strong throughout with a few small scours on the grip frame and faint amounts of darkening.  Anodized rear sight and safety lever edge display faint amounts of whitening. The never-blued barrel surface displays some dark toning as well. I rate this P One as Excellent, 95 percent vicinity by my estimate. It is Excellent shape mechanically. Bore, chamber and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent.  Three CZ-75 16 Shot Magazines are included with this pistol. c Construction is all steel including the grip frame that is serrated fore and aft. Note also that the slide is XSE style serrated fore and aft as well. Weight empty is 32.2 ounces with magazine in battery. Barrel length is 4 inches; overall length is 7 9/16 inches from muzzle to rear frame strut; height measures 5 inches from the butt of the grip frame to the top of the rear sight; slide thickness is .957 at its widest; and frame thickness measures .721 at the wide flats above the trigger guard next to the slide. This pistol sold new for $1400. I am selling it for the first $700 takes it."

It also accepts S&W 910/915/459/5900 magazines. For you CZ lovers, I also have the CZ mag catch which takes CZ75 mags and takes about 2 minutes to install. You can also buy mag catches for the Berreta 92F and Sig 226. This model CAN NOT be converted to Glock mags, just as the Glock version can not be converted to other makes. It comes with a  carry case and  three new Pro-Mag 32 rnd. S&W 59 mags that have each been cycled through twice. The mags fit in the outside pocket of the case. I also have the rifle manual and mag catch instructions. This little rifle is a blast to shoot. It is scary accurate at pistol ranges and hits much harder than a pistol through the long barrel, which you can really hear when shooting steel. It is not picky about ammo - I shoot Wolf and Tula, but aluminum-cased rounds are not recommended.  I've carefully cleaned and lubed the rifle after each shooting. Round count is 545. I bought this from the original owner in June and did not get it for $300. Selling to fund something even cooler!  Would like to see a permit at purchase."

Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic features the original Swiss folding stock, as well as a polymer ergonomic forend.

The Classic’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ button rifled barrel. AR style magazine and flash suppressor. The SIG 556 Classic brings back the look and feel of one of the world’s most sought after military rifles but on a platform available for law enforcement and responsible citizens

""The Thompson Machine Poseidon micro-9mm suppressor is truly one of the most advanced sound suppressors currently on the market.  At only 4.18” long by 1.25” in diameter and weighing in at a feather-light 3.8oz, the Poseidon offers sound suppression comparable to industry-leading silencers that are twice its size and weight.  Using artificial environment and wipe technology along with a proprietary mono-baffle stack, the Poseidon features a unique two piece endcap design to seal in the end-user’s ablative medium of choice until the suppressor is used; thus eliminating a major downside of wet suppressors.  In other words, your ablative medium won’t run out in your pocket or evaporate!  As an added selling point, the Thompson Machine Poseidon is also a true multi-caliber suppressor, and is very quiet on .22lr, .25acp, .32acp, 9×18mm, and .380acp host weapons.  The Poseidon easily and fully disassembles for cleaning, and includes the necessary take-down tools at no extra charge."" -Thompson Machine

The Equinox® is the balance between day and night.. The P229® Equinox is a compact .40 S&W designed by SIG SAUER® Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night.

Not looking to sell, and I have no cash price (don't ask). This thing is a giggle and a half to shoot - and everyone who has had a chance with it loved it! It has a vicious sense of entitlement within the safe, so I'd like it to have a good home.

Technical stuff:
Typical used WASR fit and finish, but the front sights on this one are straight, and I restained and sealed the front handguards. Chrome lined barrel. This has the underfolding wire stock, which I wrapped the right side in paracord for a better fit against the cheek. The folding stock will clear an inserted 30rd mag! Includes cleaning rod under the barrel (some didn't), 4 x 30rd mags, 1 x 10-rd mag and ~ 250rds of various ammo (dealer's choice).

Good News stuff. This AK:
1) Has eaten any ammo its ever been fed
2) Has been cleaned rigorously after every trip to the range
3) Has occasionally been taken out and held while I watch Red Dawn.
4) Is a tight example of a naughty gun that you won't be afraid to play with at the range and let your friends shoot. 
5) Could potentially be thrown into a pond, pulled out a year later, lubed with used motor oil, and still run*...I used real gun care products myself, but YMMV...

It comes with 4 magazines, two from EAA and two from kimber. It also has an assortment of springs to tune it to your gun and the 22LR ammo you use. It is used and does have a few marks on it. I had the best luck with cci minimags and the EAA magazines, but really never messed with this nearly as much as I thought, which is why I'm selling. I got it for some cheap shooting and to let my son get used to the 1911, but I never used it much and my son doesn't show interest in the 1911 unless he gets the 45ACP rounds ;) 

Let me know if you have any questions. 

I am asking $275, feel free to make offer. 
I am in Huntsville, and can meet you around here, or ship it, etc.

Unfortunately- this little baby was scratched up really bad on one specific spot on the slide in an accident - and an ill thought out plan by my battle buddy (An attempt to buff out the scratches) made it worse. I'm not gonna lie to ya' -  It's an eyesore. The rest of the slide is almost fully scratch free however. 

The good thing though it that this thing shoots like a champ - very accurate, and it'll eat any type of ammo you throw into it. I've made sure to clean this weapon on a regular basis - so the functionality is perfect.
