lets get Down to it.

Why is the is AK so expensive? It might have something to do with having 11 Bulgarian Circle 10 magazines from KVAR an impressive list of sexy custom adds. This is a serious shooters package:

• Ultimak rail 
• Krebs safety selector
• Cerakoted black. (Everything on an arsenal is great except for the original finish)
• Blue Force Gear sling with custom boot over mash hook.
• US palm Grip
• Bulgarian Krink Muzzle Break
• 10 Bulgarian Circle 10 Magazines
	2 20 rd smoke	
	7 30 rd smoke
	1 30 blk waffle

* PELICAN CASE NOT INCLUDED. 

Try to assemble this package at today’s prices from different sources and you will pay way more than this.
Plus you would need to send it out for cerakoting and assembly (depending on your skill level). s

Low round Count. She does not have any extracting problems. I have not re-zeroed it nice the rebuild due to my Chinese sight tool not fitting over site. I Got a new US Site tool in but did not get chance to go out and Re-Zero. You will need to do so after purchase. I only ran about 150 rounds through to confirm operation.

I would Like $2900.00 FIRM. I am am “NOT in any Dire Financial Straits” and I am not desperate to sell this. So serious inquiries only please. I sunk some serious $ into this rifle and would like to sell it to fund something else that has caught my fancy. You know how it is. 

Will ship to an FFL if you are OUTSIDE OH. If you are in Columbus, OH or you are willing to drive to see it. 
It is on consignment at WEST JEFF OUTFITTERS.

Terms: 			

Inside Ohio: you pay the shop, you get the Gun. 
Outside of Ohio: Call the shop, pay for the rifle, and it will be shipped to the FFL of your choosing.

Phx willingtotravel, Flagstaff, Arizona",$ 8,"Listed On: Sunday, January 27, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,looking for someone who is VERY experienced at reloading to help me.  I want to buy 7.62x54 steel core surplus and have you pull them resize them and put them in a x39 casing.  I know that reloaders aren't a dime a dozen and people who reload ak are even rarer.  I am extremely wary of reloading for myself as its has alot of start up cost and i dont have the time.  Reloading is dangerous enough and im assuming complicating things by doing what im looking to do can increase this but i know it can be done.  And i dont want to pay a dollar a round or more to possibly get had.  The ideal person would be someone who enjoys reloading and would want to do this just for the experience and getting some steel core ak ammo on the cheap if that person doesn't exist i am more than willing to compensate you for time and labor.  I am a law abiding citizen and will not use this ammo for anything other than self defense and like most of us i hope i don't have to.  I am aware of the atf laws on ap ammo and it is not illegal to possess just import.. thus the prices on it are thru the roof.  I understand the legality of selling reloaded rounds therefore i would prefer to workout some kind of deal where i buy the x54 you do the rest and get some free steel core bullets.  I will not be reselling this ammo as i said i just would like a stash and figure with regular ak ammo going for 1 dollar or more a round why not possibly pay less than that and get steel core.

Also have extra batteries for laser, ***This laser was a $350 upgrade and I've never seen another one like this. It has the aluminum frame for lightweight carry all day long with black stainless steel slide and the Black Grips that look normal but have wrap around rubber grip that comes  around the gun underneath the trigger guard for increased grip/control of gun and the laser is calibrated @50 ft. and is very accurate with the 3"" Bull Barrel with factory installed match grade trigger. You can count on this one to go bang every time-no issues and never has had any. Will sell or trade for Nice Assault Rifle like AR15 and if you have ammo to go with yours I have a huge amount of ammunition to add with this one for the right trade. May trade for your compact .45 ACP Pistol such as a Glock 30 and cash, SprIngfIeld XD compact or subcompact + cash and other 45 ACP PISTOLS AND CASH OR A NICE PISTOL/RIFLES COMBO SUCH AS A GLOCK 30 and a NICE RIFLE SUCH AS A 30-30, 30-06, .308, etc. But I prefer a NICE assault rifles with ammo/accessories and I can provide plenty of ammunition with this one if that the case. If no trades then I'll sell the gun for $1250. It cost much more than that and I've got $300 worth of brand new high quality magazines and accessories so if you bought this gun new and then spent $500+ on ammo to break it in properly and and added the $300 worth of extras you would be spending approximately $2300-$2500 and I'm asking $1250 (dont bother lowballIng me because It'll go for more on gun-broker but I may negotIate some on prIce to serIous buyers wIth cash offers but Im not goIng to negotIate very much on the prIce- Im losIng money already, I dont have to sell and Im not desperate for the money so dont ask me to take hundreds of dollars off bjtor trade for a NICE AR and ammo or HIGH QUALITY .45 ACP PISTOL/ HIGH CALIBER SCOPED RIFLE COMBO.

Troy Industries has been one of the finest supplier of mil. spec. battle rifles parts and accessories and their civilian counterparts for years; this COMMITMENT to EXCELLENCE is exemplified as each magazine carries a LIFETIME WARRANTY.  Just as they had made an exclusive deal to bring their quality products to the public through an exclusive retailer, the potential AWB caused this national retailer to drop exclusive rights. These magazines are no longer available in stores and may never will be again.
These magazines are easily disassembled for cleaning or, if the laws change, modifiable to change to a ten round capacity  so your not stuck with 30 round paperweight you cannot legally use. They include both a flush, bolstered plate and a next generation floor plate which functions as a shock absorber or as a handy pull tab, to pull from mag holders.
These magazines are new and come in retail packaging of three. However, I will sell them individually, if need be. These magazines need to be back in the hands of the public and not experiencing the AWB already by being no longer available to the general public. I will ship to states where such items are legal. Price is $45 OBO per mag or $100 for a pack of 3.

it would have sold for 90 days earlier.  I decided to keep $1200 and sent a check in the amount of a $400 donation to the NRA.  I have been investing in guns for 40 years with the main intent of resale at a later time.  So I understand and have practiced the rule of buy low, sell high.  But this shouldn't be about putting extra greenbacks in your wallet. It's a time to reinvest your profits to fight for OUR 2nd amendment.  I have to say, it was more gratifying to write that check then it was seeing the profit in my bank account.

With that all said, I challenge all sellers to invest some small portion of their gain in a donation to the NRA as they are OUR only voice in Washington. 

If this idea caught on across the Armslist community, coast to coast,  I rest assure we would strengthen the NRA to extinguish this nonsense."

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is a .40 S&W caliber.

Once you BUY/OWN a Lancer AWF Mag....you will throw away your PMAGS!

The L5AWM is the only HYBRID AR magazine available today, featuring the best characteristics of Polymer and Steel magazine designs. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.

The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few.

I have some .30-06 in a SEALED AIR TIGHT Spam can (as in, never seen air since sealed), you need a can opener to get to the Ammo.  I have some from another can that have been pulled out so you can see condition, etc.  This is bright shiny annealed BRASS Loaded Ammunition.  It's beautiful.  Greep HXP 1968 Manufacture.

This is 240 rounds, in (12x) 20 round cardboard boxes.  These haven't seen air since they were made, and haven't been banging against each other for every single movement they have had for all of time.  If I take one of these out of it's box, it'll look like it was made yesterday.  

I saw these -sell- at the gun show in Raleigh TODAY for $1.90 a bullet at the gun show.  I'm asking $1 per bullet, and mine are still in sealed spam cans!!

Please don't confuse these with what CMP sells now (or sold out of, over a year ago).
CMP sold 192 rounds on M1 enbloc clips, Loose, or 200 rounds loose, mixed headstamp.  Mixed headstamp means not necessarily all from the same batch or lot.  If a couple cans of these got opened up over the years, and you shot some, and dumped the rest into a bucket, you would then have ""loose, mixed headstamp.""  And if you were a CMP Member (Or affiliated club), you could get the discount.  Not quite the same thing as still sealed in original air-tight container that you need a sardine can opener to open (included)."

Umarex H&K Heckler Koch MP5 A5 - 22lr
This is the first official Heckler & Koch MP5 chambered in .22 LR. Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5 is engineered as a dedicated .22 rim fire rifle. It's built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. They are proportionate in size to the center fire version's magazine to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine.
