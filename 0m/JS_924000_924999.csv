This brass is tough to find because it does not get used in high volume quantities like the other military brass. It is also not used for combat, but for matches as it comes from the M118LR round used by snipers and competition shooters. These cases are generally regarded as more consistent cases and do NOT have primer crimps in the primer pockets.

This AR is very accurate and excellent for target shooting or prairie dog shooting.  55 grain bullets work very well.  The condition of the rifle is excellent.  About 1500 rounds through the rifle.  Gas rings were just changed to ensure reliability for new owner.  Rifle has functioned flawlessly for me.

Face to face, no felons.  21 or older.  Will want to see a CCW or CO drivers license (just name and photo).  Will want a receipt for both parties.  Cash only.  Local sale only, will not ship.

Rubber cheek weld attached to folding stock (removable). UTG quad rail with scope mount installed, quad rail covers included. Original foregrip included (not shown in pictures). Bipod stud mounted in quad rail. Folding forward pistol grip with storage compartment. Bayonet lug. Flip up night sights present, but no glow left in tritium tubes. A new Israeli extractor and extractor spring were installed after purchase. The serial number starts with GAL and the ejector lug and receiver looks great. There have been between 350 and 500 rounds fired through the rifle since I purchased it new. Bore is in fantastic shape. Shoots brass or steel case ammo.
This rifle is a combination of an AR-15 and an AK-47. The receiver is milled and the folding stock is very solid and locks up tight, made from steel tubing and a cast aluminum butt section. This rifle has a chromed gas piston and a right side charging handle, that can be charged with the left hand also as it is vertically oriented. The rifle is much more accurate than the typical AK-47 type design. Chrome lined barrel. The front sight hood is a full circle, so it is easy to line up with the ar style flip 2 size peep rear sights. There are flip up night sights but the tritium does not glow, the night sights can be replaced by new mepro sights from Optics Planet for about $80.
The magazines are all in very good shape and are metal, not plastic. There are (12) 35 round magazines. There are (5) 12 round magazines-purchased new (unused).
