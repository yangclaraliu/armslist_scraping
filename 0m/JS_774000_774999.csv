At last, the SCAR 17S is here. The new rifle is a semi-automatic-only version of the military’s selective-fire MK17 Mod 0 or Special Ops Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) Heavy. Chambered in .308 Win./7.62x51 mm NATO, the gun is bigger and more powerful than its .223 Rem./5.56x45 mm NATO predecessor, the SCAR 16S, but, thankfully, not objectionably so. No longer constrained by limitations of that gun’s smaller receiver and chambering, the bigger SCAR 17S greatly expands the potential utility of the SCAR platform. One can argue that the SCAR Heavy was what Special Operations Command (SOCOM) wanted all along: a modern carbine chambered in 7.62x51 mm NATO that is lightweight, reliable and accurate."

I wasn't totally happy with the fit and instead of attempting to stretch it out, I did some bing and google searches which indicate that it is for the Ruger SP101 and not the LCR which has a slightly oversized trigger guard. The guy I purchased the LCR from was really nice but I believe he purchased this because it is for a 2"" Ruger revovler an didn't realize that the SP101 and the LCR are shaped a little differently. It is brown and looks exactly like the one in this picture. A few of the links I found when I googled the holster indicate that it may also work with a Charter Arms revolver. It might but I believe it is really designed for the SP101. This looks to me to be a quality holster but I am very particular about the trigger guard being covered and I think it would work better for someone with an SP101. I'll take $20 cash or trade for ammo if you're in the Knoxville area. PM me if you are interested in shipping.

 Here's a professional quality picture I located that is better than I would take. It looks brand new and just like this one. I think the guy I bought the revolver from pocket carried it and didn't have it very long before he just had to move up to the much manlier .357 version.

This is not a normal AK. This is a heavy barrel squad weapon designed for extended fire and higher accuracy. Design includes a flip-down carrying handle, folding heavy-duty steel stock, rear windage adjustable sight and heavy duty stamped receiver.

Design details:
Operating mechanism - The AES-10B RPK functions identically to the AK-47. It also uses the same 7.62x39mm ammunition. It has a similar design layout to the AK-47 series of rifles, with modifications to increase the RPK's effective range and accuracy, enhance its sustained fire capability, and strengthen the receiver.

Features - Most notably, the AES-10B RPK has a heavier and longer barrel (23.5"") than an AK. This allows the AES-10B RPK to fire for extended periods of time without major loss in accuracy due to the barrel heating up. The chrome-lined barrel is permanently fixed to the receiver, and cannot be replaced in the field. It is fitted with a new front sight base, gas block (lacks the bayonet lug) and an under-barrel cleaning rod guide. The barrel also features a folding bipod, mounted near the muzzle. The barrel's muzzle is threaded, enabling the use of muzzle devices such as flash hiders, compensators, and blank-firing adapters. When a muzzle device is not being used, the threads on the muzzle can be covered by a thread protector. The barrel is pinned to the receiver in a modified trunnion, reinforced by ribbing, and is slightly wider than the trunnion used on standard AK type rifles. Symmetrical bulges on both sides of the front trunnion ensure proper fit inside the receiver.

The AES-10B RPK's receiver cover is stamped from a smooth 1.5 mm (0.1 in) sheet of steel (compared to the 1 mm sheet metal receiver cover used on standard AK rifles). Interchangeability of parts between the RPK and AKM is moderate.

The AES-10B RPK uses a modified AKM recoil spring assembly. It consists of a rear spring guide rod from the AK, and a new forward flat guide rod and coil spring.

The RPK features a thick wood foregrip, and a folding steel buttstock, which is designed to allow the user to carry and store more easily. The RPK uses a standard AK pistol grip.

The weapon can use standard AK detachable box magazines, but is most commonly used with a 40 round capacity magazine, or a 75 round drum magazine.

Sights - The weapon's rear sight leaf is elevation adjustable, and graduated for ranges of 100 to 1,000 meters, in 100 m increments. The rear sight leaf also features a windage adjustment knob, unique to the RPK series of rifles."

Developed and manufactured in Korea by the Daewoo Precision Industries branch of the Daewoo Corporation, the K5 pistol is now standard sidearm of the armed forces of South Korea. The basic 9mm K5 is sold as Daewoo DP-51, its compact variant is sold as DP-51c, and the variant in the .40SW is sold as DH-40. These pistols are well made and shoot well.

Daewoo K5 / DP51 pistol is short recoil operated, locked breech weapon. It uses a conventional Browning-type locking system, with two lugs on the barrel engaging cuts inside the slide. Locking and unlocking is controlled by the cam-shaped lug at the bottom of the barrel. Frame of the pistol is made from aluminum alloy; all other parts are made from steel. Trigger is of “triple action” type. This means that other than traditional double or single action fire modes it has “fast action” mode, apparently borrowed from FN’s GP “Fast Action” pistol. In this mode hammer is cocked by the cycle of the slide, then it is pushed forward by the pressure on the hammer head. In this position, the main spring remains cocked, so only light pressure on the trigger is necessary to recock the hammer and fire the gun in the “double action manner”. Or, alternatively, hammer can be recocked manually to be fired in single action for maximum first-shot accuracy. Sights are fixed, with the rear sight dovetailed to the slide. Magazines are of double stack type; proprietary magazines hold 13 rounds, but DP-51 also can use Smith-Wesson 5906 magazines, which will slightly protrude from the bottom of the grip."

New laws are being proposed that will make your AR-15 a Class 3 weapon. This means that if you want to keep your tactical rifles, you will have to register them, pay a $5-$200 tax, and notify the government if you intend to take them out of state. You will also completely waive your 4th Amendment rights to reasonable search and seizure. ATF will have the right to knock on your door and inspect the weapons anytime they want. You will also see an end to standard capacity magazines. This isn't a threat. It isn't political posturing. Diane Feinstein and the anti-gun machine have already introduced the legislation, and it will be rammed through Congress and signed by the President if we do not Stand As One and act today. 

The new law proposals may also will require ALL new and old gun owners ( not just ""AR types) to be fingerprinted and photographed.

Upper assemblies and the parts to build them will always be available. I am willing to meet in person if you would like to avoid paperwork or I can ship to an FFL holder if there is a considerable distance between us.

The gas-piston system of this rifle is similar to the AK-47, it uses a gas port forward in the barrel to force a long piston op-rod backwards; discharging the casing and loading a new round. The gas system has two settings, both of them appear to be of the same port size (providing a dirty-port alternative; in case of a gas system failure)

It’s chambered in .223/5.56mm and has a 1 in 7″ twist rate barrel. It’s capable of using AR-15 type magazines that are widely available in a range of capacities. The rifle has an “HK-Style” sight system (rotary distance adjustable rear, post-in-ring up front) with an additional rear sight integrated into the rail system (emergency backup only; it’s a very flimsy piece of hinged steel). The rifle has ambidextrous safety selectors, and an AR-15 style magazine release.

The grip angle is a bit more swept back, and a longer reach to the safety selector, than the AR-15. The reciprocating charging handle is located on the right side of the weapon, directly attached to the bolt. The trigger is a two-stage of pull, that breaks cleanly and evenly with repeatable first stage take-up every time. The Stock is a plastic Swiss-Style side folder, similar to that of the Sig SG 550 rifles. The bold hold/release is in a similar location to the AR-15, but operates on an extended pivot system comparatively.

Comes with:

1 -Sig 556 Rifle
1 -Box
1 -Paperwork
1 -30rd Metal Sig Sauer Mag
1 -30rd Lancer Smoke colored mag (in picture)

They take their time making these and it shows in the quality of the machining. Not only are the milled slots and reamed holes precise, they are also clean and smooth. The internal machining is among the cleanest you will ever see in an AR-type rifle. Once machined and checked, the receivers are hard-coat anodized. They also have a set screw tightening feature at the rear lug area to eliminate any movement between the upper and lower assemblies. These are indeed one of the best lower receivers on the market and it is ready for your upper. Please contact us if you have any questions. I will ship this for Free to your local FFL Dealer.

Would be open to partial trades for Glock 21Gen4, Steyr M9A1, Steyr S9A1, A clean (non-Century) AK 74. 
I am trying to be fair with the price, the cost into the gun is about 1900. If I were charging like everyone for the 800-900 AR they are selling for 2-3K, then this gun would be 3500-5000, but am not going up on it - 1900 will get this gun."

The gas-piston system of this rifle is similar to the AK-47, it uses a gas port forward in the barrel to force a long piston op-rod backwards; discharging the casing and loading a new round. The gas system has two settings, both of them appear to be of the same port size (providing a dirty-port alternative; in case of a gas system failure)

It’s chambered in .223/5.56mm and has a 1 in 7″ twist rate barrel. It’s capable of using AR-15 type magazines that are widely available in a range of capacities. The rifle has an “HK-Style” sight system (rotary distance adjustable rear, post-in-ring up front) with an additional rear sight integrated into the rail system (emergency backup only; it’s a very flimsy piece of hinged steel). The rifle has ambidextrous safety selectors, and an AR-15 style magazine release.

The grip angle is a bit more swept back, and a longer reach to the safety selector, than the AR-15. The reciprocating charging handle is located on the right side of the weapon, directly attached to the bolt. The trigger is a two-stage of pull, that breaks cleanly and evenly with repeatable first stage take-up every time. The Stock is a plastic Swiss-Style side folder, similar to that of the Sig SG 550 rifles. The bold hold/release is in a similar location to the AR-15, but operates on an extended pivot system comparatively.

Comes with:

1 -Sig 556 Rifle
1 -Box
1 -Paperwork
1 -30rd Metal Sig Sauer Mag
1 -30rd Lancer Smoke colored mag (in picture)
1 -Extended safety lever (factory safety lever included as well)

Changed my mind, I'd prefer a Norinco SKS in good shape for my personal collection...  Or I would consider a LEFT-handed bolt-action youth model hunting rifle in .243, .260, or maybe .270.  Something for my sons first hunting season next year; he's a small kid.    I'd prefer a trade (SKS, maybe plus ammo depending on condition), but if you really want it, I'll take $400 cash (enough to put towards the kiddo's rifle)."

The 2 weapons lights are surefire M962s. They have a weapons light mount but no pressure switches. They both come with brand new surefire cr123 batteries to ensure that they work.

The other 2 surefire flashlights are brand new. I have opened them out of the box to make sure they work, but they do come with everything they would from the factory. One is a surefire 8nx commander nitrolon (recharchable). Like i said comes with eveything like new so it comes with two different battery sources that are rechargable by car or a wall plug in.

I bought this knife last week and I am absoultly in love with it. This is the most SOLID folder I have ever owned. The reason I am selling it.... its a little bit to big. When I saw it on Benchmade's website I knew I had to have it, plus I thought it was cool that a portion of my money was donated to the ranger assistance foundation. Like I said this knife it truly spectacular, I just wish it was a little bit smaller. Oh, and this knife was designed by custom knife maker Shane Sibert. Of course this is a Benchmade Black Class Product commonly used for Law Enforcement and Public Safety. This knife is essentially brand new, I carried it in my pocket far a week and didn't cut a thing. If you know about knives then you know that this is quality. If you are not a knife person, Benchmade is one of the best knives you can buy. You will see why when you hold this in your hand. Please no lowball offers, they will be ignored. The MSRP on this knife is around $195.00

(This is listed as a Savage Arms gun as Stevens is not offered as a choice of attribute)This old rascal has seen action from an uncle that last carried it afield in maybe 1975, and it has the typical cosmetic and field wear and tear of guns that are now maybe 70 years old. The serial numbers match, 110XX, but I have no idea when this one was made. The grip and stock caps are origiinal. Forearm and stock checkering is crisp. The model 621 was the deluxe solid ribbed barrel upgrade to the model 620.  Not a lot of blue remains, as shown, and the barrel exterior surface rusted long ago leaving the familiar brown patina that is normal of old firearms.  Bore is shiny. This gun loads,cycles and ejects fine, action is smooth and the firing pin dents an inert shell primer just fine, but I would recommend a gunsmith inspect any semi-vintage firearm like this one before use. Mag tube capacity is 5 rounds.My plan was to shorten the barrel to 19"" to make this into something that can easily and quickly break down as shown into a little 20""X 2""X 6"" pack or bug out bag for end of the world prepping or into a quick and handy Home Defense weapon. Plans have changed and I will leave this old dude to you and your plan. I have tried to show the worst of the flaws and I have seen far newer guns in far worse condition. Additional pictures are available by email. Price is cash and firm. Monkey business or BS drama is not welcome, and I will extend the same to you.

This is the mid length A4 model.  I picked this thing up just before prices went up because it was all that I could find.  I know many people are really into the 6.8mm especially as a second AR.  However, this will be my only AR15 and I would rather have 5.56.  

I am open to trades for 5.56 AR15, but it will have to be a vary nice one, or you will have to throw in some cash or accessories.  I am also open to trade for a 5.56 upper plus cash/accessories, because I do have another lower that I need to complete.

I am also looking for a nice AK or similar variant in 7.62 only.  Again, I'll need a little extra for that trade as well.  I am also looking for a Springfield M1A.  I would be willing to throw in a little extra on my end in trade for an M1A, especially the SOCOM II variety.  

Otherwise, my price is a little lower than what I can auction for on GunBroker.

As you can see I have a (ATI brand, I believe) dragonav style stock, 2 tapco 20 rd mags and a 75 round drum mag that I've never fired from only slide it in to see if it fits and it does of course. I have all original #'s matching parts for this gun still. The fixed 10 rd mag. Full blade bayonet assembly (blade bayonet was on the first 9 million produced, spike after that) I believe it's the older one made for battle, not the later one made purely to export to sell. China made these to defend their country. Wood stock (which is beautiful). I actually switched stocks to preserve the original because I was paranoid about hurting it. I have several stripper clips and a stripper clip belt to go with that holds 20 full stripper clips (200 rds). I just don't shoot this much anymore. I have a current MN permit that allows me to buy firearms and of course I have a current drivers license. I hope you have the same. Cause if not its kind of a deal breaker. Sorry.
