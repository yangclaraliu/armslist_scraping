So, after talking to the guy, a fellow INGOer and nice guy in general, I am going to just try my luck at selling these grips to YOU! I actually really liked these grips, and the only reason I am selling them is because they don't fit my stinking gun. They appear to be in new or like new condition, but with no box or packaging. The stamp on the inside states they are for the Ruger Redhawk, as seen in the pictures below. I am asking $15 obo, and I pay shipping.

This pistol only has about 300 rounds through it.  It has been kept in my Liberty safe with dehumidifier.  I have the original box, two magazines, holster, extra grips, and all manuals and paperwork.  It has a light scratch from reassembly since it was my first 1911 and I did not know these guns were susceptible to the ""idiot scratch"".  It's not that bad.

I am selling this gun since I just bought a Sig 1911 and I needed to sell a gun to appease my wife.

 3.8"" XDM 9mm W/ Black Finish

In 2009, these features won the XD(M) the coveted NRA American Rifleman Golden Bullseye Award for ""Handgun of the Year""! An honor the XD family has won 3 times!

 XDM Features

 XDM DESIGN

 Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.

 (M)odel Contour Frame

 The ideal grip angle of the XD has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.

 (M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations

 Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.

 (M)ega-Lock Texture

 The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 

The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

 XDM TECHNOLOGY

 Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.

 (M)elonite

 Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 

The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M)is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

 (M)atch Grade Barrel

 Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry


(M)inimal Reset Trigger

 The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

 XDM INNOVATIONS

 The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD is now captured in the all new XD(M) line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M) series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.

 (M)inimal Error Disassembly


Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.

 (M)aximum Reach Mag Release


The modified contour of the new XD(M)grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.

 (M)ega Capacity Magazine


The new XD(M) Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR Mag 
X-Tension (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the 
.40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.

 XDM PERSONALIZATION

 Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M), you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.

 (M)ould-Tru Backstraps


With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.

 (M)ulti-Adjust Rail System


A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position. 

(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case


Your total XD(M) experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.

 (M)agazine X-Tensions


With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions, SPRINGFIELD ARMORYhas added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)


XDM STANDARDS

 In 2001, Springfield Armory set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. With the introduction of the XD polymer pistol, they did just that….

 Loaded Chamber Indicator

 The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.

 Striker Status Indicator

 The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. 


USA Trigger System

 The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.

 Grip Safety

 Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

WOW

Springfield Armory® has just introduced a new 1911 designed for
people interested in shooting competitively. It is called— The RO™,
“Range Officer™”. The RO™ is designed to give the shooter
exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to
create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of
shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he
likes most. It is built with the same quality as the TRP™ and Trophy
Match™ models, but Springfield has removed the “extras” that result
in a higher price. It’s everything you need in a competition model,
at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs.

Purists, don't worry, somebody butchered the original rifle attempting to turn it into a sporter, so I didn't ruin a pristine collector piece.

I drilled and tapped the receiver for Leupold rings and bases.  I mounted an Adams & Bennett F34 contour barrel (heavy sporter), and chambered in 7x57 Mauser.  I cut the barrel to 19"" (IIRC), and a new crown cut on a lathe.  All metal work except the barrel was parkerized (my park tank will not accomodate barrels), and everything finished off with satin black Norrell Moly Resin.  The stock is from Boyd's, and finished with several coats of Tung Oil finish.  The action is pillar- and glass-bedded.  

Using Remington brass, H4895, Winchester primers, and Sierra 140 grain Pro-Hunter bullets, she will easily hold MOA, mostly under MOA, all day long.


Rifle comes as pictured, minus scope.  I also have a set of Lee neck sizing dies, and roughly 20 rounds of ammunition and 20 cases.  Those numbers are approximate - I have 40 casings total, and I think 20 of those are loaded, give or take.  There is a partial box of the Sierra Pro Hunter bullets (40 bullets left, IIRC), as well as a partial box of Hornady 139 grain bullets (not sure how many, but can tell you right now this rifle does NOT like this particular Hornady bullet, would make good plinker bullets though).

Pistol has 1k rounds fired.  It's got a little finish wear in the typical spots (underneath the safety, underside of the magwell, and on the rail from light mounting).  I'd say 97% condition cosmetically.  It wears Nighthawk T3 Alien grips.

Functionally it's absolutely perfect.  Just broken in.  The slide feels like it runs on glass.  The trigger pull is 3.5# and feels absolutely perfect.  The weapon has the full length guide rod, bull barrel, and target sights, and is crazy accurate.

Rifle is brand new, Fired only once. only 60 rounds put thru it.

Reason im getting rid of it is because its not what I am looking for in an AR15 its more for someone who shoots targets. super accurate rifle I paid 3,750 after taxes, thaats including Burris ar-3x optics also fore grip bi-pod and I got a mag pul after market rubber hand grip.

The gun is alone $3,000 retail in stores.

after adding 

burris 3x zoom red/green/black optics - $350 + tax

bad lever - $35.99 + tax

fore grip/bi pod - $129.99 + tax

mag pul grip - $24.99 + tax

getting this rifle for $3000 is a steal Im firm on the price I still have the receipt from 6/14/12 thats when I got it ! ! Just not what I want I bought an LMT ar today and im making the money back by selling this one you wont find a better deal for such a custom rifle. it has the mag pul stock a heavy barrel custom railing custom charging handle. If you bought this in stores for $3000 you would just get the gun and thats not even including tax. SO I WILL TAKE NO LOWER THEN 3000 ill even show origanal receipt gun is brand new ! !

I bought this particular 586 new in the Early 1980's and used it for target practice and dispatching the occasional porcupine in the early 1990's.  I have not shot it much since then.

This is the early version 586 with the 6 inch barrel, six shot capacity.  It is in very nice condition with virtually no scratches or gouges at all.  Bluing is in great shape with only two wear marks at the front right side of the barrel and under lug where it contacted my holster.   There is a scratch on the cylinder where the rotation mechanism works but I'm going to blame those on Smith & Wesson as they are caused by cylinder rotation.

The revolver comes with the original wood grips and the Pachmayr rubber grips which I found more comfortable for target use (my hands are smaller than average I guess).

There's not a ton of information about them, but there is a popular rumor that they were designed for the CIA in the late 60s. Here's what a prestigious auction house wrote about one:

QUOTE///
There is a lot of incorrect, conflicting information in regards to the history and production of the Plainfield M1 Carbines and Model 71 Pistols. There is very little published information at all for Plainfield prior to 1970.
Plainfield began business as a small short run tool and die company in New Jersey in the 1950's. The company was approached by the CIA early in 1960. Plainfield was supplied with large quantities of M1 Carbine parts and M1 Garand barrels. Through the 1960's Plainfield manufactured new receivers and modified M1 Garand barrels for use on the M1 Carbines. At their peak, Plainfield had 60 employees assembling large quantities of M1 and M2 Carbines. Employees and others were told the Carbines were for export for the Army. The one sales person handled export from a separate one man office. Calls from individuals to the sales office were never returned.
The FBI showed up at Plainfield to stop the ""smuggling"" of 1,000 ready to ship M1 Carbines destined for the 1961 Bay of Pigs.

From that point tens of thousands of Carbines were exported to US friendly forces for Vietnam before the war started and to the Orient. The government Carbine work continued through the Kennedy era and only slowed down around 1969-1970. In the late 1960's Plainfield was asked to produce a high quality interchangeable caliber pistol with disposable bolt and barrel. This was quickly accomplished by designer Gary Wilhelm and two highly skilled prototype mechinists. The Plainfield was produced in .22 L.R., .25 A.C.P. and .32 A.C.P. The production of 50-75 in .32 A.C.P. were lost and never accounted for.

All of the work done by Plainfield for the CIA (90%+ of its business) from 1960 - 1970 was done with no publicity or problem.

The decrease of government work at the end of the 1960's may be due to the theft of 46 Carbines during the July, 1967 Plainfield riots (or the theft of 41 Carbines before the riots started!). New Jersey state police and national guardsman started a house to house search for the weapons but were stopped after 1 1/2 hours. Weeks after the riots the FBI and police continued searching with only a few guns recovered.

With the loss of government work Plainfield commercialized the sale of Plainfield Model 71 pistols and Carbines in the early 1970's.

The Plainfield model 71 pistol and conversion offered in this auction is the commercial model which is mechanically identical to the government model.

A unique, well engineered high quality pistol for the semi-automatic collector or shooter.
///END QUOTE

I can't vouch for the accuracy of that story, but either way, the Model 71 is very well made and cleverly engineered. It is SAO and all steel. They also came with a 22lr kit, but this one is only in 25acp. The guns alone are very rare, and extra kits are even more scarce.

Here's an informative review video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFpmSO2kd8g

I've only put a few magazines through it but it functions fine. Very accurate, too. Sadly, as you can tell, the finish is mostly gone, with maybe 10-20% remaining, and the grips look to have had an ""interesting"" life. These were originally parkerized, so it may be a fun project to restore the finish to like-new.

The interior parts are in good shape, though, and look almost new.

For sale or trade is my friends SA XDm 3.8 chambered in 9mm.  This pistol has the gull size frame (19+1) and the 3.8 Barrel.  I bought this pistol new a couple of years ago and put approximately 4-500 rounds down the pipe.  My buddy bought this from me and put approximately 200 rounds through it.  The pistol is in great condition with low round count (unless your one of those uneducated people who think 700 rounds is a high round count).  
It comes with 3 extra SA magazines (totaling 5 including the 2 that came with it.  It also comes with a ACE IWB holster and an
 OWB Mini Slide Holster- Link ( http://magills.com/pgroup_descrip/7169_XD9+XD40+4+inch/7445_Mini+Slide+Holster/?mode=image&image=461 ). 
 Comes with factory case and hardware such as back straps, Mag Pouch, Speed loader, holster etc.  The pistol is all stock and was my carry gun until i Switched to all 1911s. Never had a malfunction of any kind and don't let the 3.8 barrel fool you when it comes to accuracy.  The first IDPA match a friend of mine shot and borrowed this gun he was the most accurate shooter and had only put 20 rounds through it prior to the match.  The only reason my friend wants to sell it now is he has owned it over a year and never shoots it.  He would like to trade as well!!!

The previous owner shot 80 rounds through it (he gave me the other 120 of the 200 he bought) and I shot 100 rounds through it.  Sweet shooting gun.  If I kept it, I would take off the thumb safety though (easily removed without gunsmithing)."
