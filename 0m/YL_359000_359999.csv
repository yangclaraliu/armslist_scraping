This listing is for an extremely rare High Standard 10B Bullpup shotgun! Otherwise known as the HS10. This gun was originally commissioned for the police force in the early 60's. The gun is in good condition, the bore is 100%, clean as a mirror. There is some wear to the gun, mainly on the sight posts, and some on the plastic housings. The barrel is 18"" or over (maybe 18.5"")

All components work. Bluing on the barrel is almost gone. This gun would look amazing with a Duracoat or other gun paint job!! I was going to do it, but I'm needing money right now. It would cost less then $20 to Duracoat the gun. The innards of the gun are in extremely good shape, was shot very little by previous owner, I shot it about 150 rounds, but have since cleaned it 3 times. 

I was just shooting some round ball slugs yesterday with it, and was very surprised at the accuracy (I hit 10 out of 10 at 50 yards). It's an extremely fun gun to shoot, everyone who I've let shoot it is surprised how little recoil there is. It's just the way it's designed. The gun is 4+1, and runs best with high brass loads. 
It's missing the flashlight and carry handle, has original but pad. I live in Kansas, but can ship anywhere in the US. 


The front sight lug is included, it's just not pictured on the gun!



Phone number: REDACTED


Local is $599 cash, no trades. I need some cash quick. Can meet in the Wichita, Hutchinson, Heston, Moundridge, Hillsboro and Goessel areas.

Anywhere else, Money Order only, the gun will ship once the check clears. Buyer pays shipping (Which will probably be around $30)"

I have ideas of what this is worth, but i'm mainly looking for trades for a nice pistol. I'm a HUGE fan of 1911, but am interested in any other pistols. Let me know what you have.

I bought it because I love AK's, but after shooting my friends pistol, I know that's what I should of gotten. I enjoy the challenge of a handgun.
I love the ak and will keep if I can get a little extra money to get the pistol I want, but for now I feel it's smarter to trade one for the other."

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Specifications:

- Capacity: 6+1 Rounds
- Weight: 11 Ounces
- Width: .8""
- Barrel Length: 3.00""
- Firing Mechanism: Striker Fire

I don't know much about it as I don't shoot but I had a neighbor check it out.  He shot 5 rounds and they all fired fine.  These bullets are brass and they seem to be quite tarnished.  Much of the 'dirtiness' rubs off however and none of the bullets I looked at were pitted in any way.  All 1100 rounds are boxed in lots of 50.  The back of the cartridge says '76', 'S.F.', '9mm, and 'I'.  The neighbor told me what type of case they are but I already forgot what he said.  He told me they are the kind that cannot be reloaded, which is why he didn't want to buy them.  I gave him the open box and I'm left with 1100 rounds.  I want the buyer to take them all.

191,http://www.armslist.com/posts/359191,For Sale:  Cold Steel Kudu knife  South Africa,"old town, Fort Collins, Colorado",$ 7,"Listed On: Sunday, April 22, 2012",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a brand new knife in the original packaging.

In South Africa, an inexpensive ring lock folder is sold everywhere. It's a good design, but it's constructed from sub-standard materials, is poorly made, and is horribly overpriced. And yet, millions of these knives are sold there each year. Well, we thought we could do better, in the quality of materials, cutting performance, and in price.

The Cold Steel Kudu, takes some cues from its South African competition, but our version is vastly superior. Ours has a Krupp 4116 Stainless steel flat ground blade, heat treated to Rc 56-57 for better edge holding ability and ease of re-sharpening, and a thin razor sharp edge.

For safety, we have thoroughly tested the locking mechanism and are well satisfied it will hold the blade rigidly open until you decide to close it by pulling up on the ring attached to the back spring.

The handle of the Kudu also reflects our dedication to making an effective and affordable folder. It's made of 43% glass reinforced ZytelÂ®. This material has proven to be extremely strong, and is stiff enough to complement the blade and spring when locked open. Plus, the gripping surface has a wood grain texture for traction and features an attractive polished steel Kudu horn emblem for a little extra flair! We think the Kudu represents an unbelievable value. It's ready for anything and makes a wonderful work knife, utility knife, bait knife, or hunting knife.

This is a un-fired rifle. It has only been taken out of the box to add the scope mounts (included). 

These are solid rifles, and the .30-06 is capable of taking almost any game you want. 

The rifle includes the manual, all the plastic, the factory target (which puts it at sub-MOA). 

I was planning on making this my deer rifle, but am in a financial bind, and do not want to pawn it and lose it for nothing. 

These rifles sell for around $430-$450. Mine is 100% brand new, never used. No handling, no marks, no dings etc.

After speaking with someone from FN, more information has come to light about this particular Hi Power, and my earlier information was deemed incorrect.

This pistol is from one of the first production runs out of FN after Liege was liberated from the Germans, assembled from parts produced under German occupation but with all Liege/Allied markings (no German stamping of any sort). Based on the serial number, it was probably produced in late '44 or early '45. Smooth top slide, no rib, GI sights. Serial number is A60xx -- rare four digit with A series prefix.


I'm in no hurry to sell this as I don't really need the money or the Glock, this is just for my fun. 

Includes one serial number matching 13rd FN (extremely rare type magazine with split tongue baseplate), two 13rd FN OEM mags, and two 15rd MecGar mags, Spegel style grips and original WWII grips, Israeli 1911 holster modified to fit the Hi Power, and a Hunter leather holster."

There’s a new option in concealed carry performance: the P220® Compact. The P220 Compact is a 6+1 capacity pistol featuring enhanced ergonomics and true concealability in the powerful .45 Auto platform. The shortened frame provides concealability while the ergonomically contoured magazine floorplate lengthens the grip just enough to provide a firm grip for even large handed shooters. The hard coat anodize alloy frame combines light weight and strength for extreme durability. The integrated accessory rail ensures compatibility with industry standard options, such as our STL-900L Tactical Light & Laser. Topping the compact frame is a shorter, “commander-length” stainless slide housing a 3.9” cold hammer forged barrel and external extractor, for enhanced reliability. Like all P220 pistols, the Compact features a rock solid lock up and superb out-of-the-box accuracy. In a world full of concealed carry options, the P220 Compact’s improved ergonomics, slim profile and shorter slide and frame make the pistol the ideal choice. And with the SIG name you know that when it comes to protecting your life you’re backed by a standard of excellence unmatched in the firearms world

I would like an O/U .22 derringer to complete my collection.  .22 LR or WMR is okay, and would even consider .22 short.  Prefer nickle/chrome in very good or better condition, but am open to other finishes and conditions, as long as the cam and firing pins are fully functional.

Strongly prefer an Italian, German, or Spanish import.  No interest in Davis, Cobra, Cimmaron, High Standard, or American Derringer Corp.  In my opinion, safety switches have no place on a derringer.

I am willing to pay above blue book value and also have a few possible trades.

Thanks."

Made my money on these and ready to make some room, (and 1000 of these frames take up quite a bit of it)

These are all serial #ed pre ban pistol frames, so they can get granfathered in some instances.

FAET has been paid on these. So the 800 receivers are fully serialed & manufactured and bypass the +/-50 tax exemption.

I have already sold out of all other ap-9 parts and will NOT be machining out any more.

(due to many question let me add this)
I am not the manufacturer,,,,these were made in 1994 by AA Arms in indian trail NC. These are all OEM replacement receivers last production serial. The first production run of the frames were prone to cracking, these frames are a more pliable compound more somewhat more like a glock composition, to use as warranty replacements.

The first several years of these frames manufactured you can put in a press and it will shatter in a hundred pieces like a piece of frozen peanut brittle,  but these frames will just compress and still takes a bit of work to rip them apart.

I usually sell about 2-10 frames a week. Sell some at the shows and some on gunbroker, most of mine sell straight from my site.

They do not sell fast, but there is a GREAT profit margin. Like I said, I made my money,,,but need more room at the moment.

thinking of taking these and doing a transfer to myself (to personal collection) and storing them for 20-30 years just to see if these POSSIBLY may fall into some granfather clause in the event of a serious gun control crackdown.

KEEP in mind these are considered ALREADY manufactured firearms,,,,,,,,that could prove to be very useful.


thanks,

Same model and mark (it was a no1, mark 3) The only differences in the one I have is the stock has been replaced with a more useable modern ATI stock, (I have the altered original stock), and of course it has the Scope so you don't have to use the iron sites. It is the harder to find original 10 round magazine load. It fires predictable.

These were famous WW1 rifles known for their speed of action and how fast the British riflemen could fire on target.

Lee Enfield .303 British Bolt Action Rifle for sale. Dated 1916, known as an Enfield Number 1 Mark 3 SMLE (small magazine Lee Enfield). Seems accurate and smooth, Fires decently and works smoothly. Magazine Holds 10 Rounds. Action, barrel, and bolt all match serial numbers. Bore is decent and chamber looks good.

Upgraded ATI Stock, for easier usage and handling. ATI Scope mount to attach scope, (scope shown not included but can be added.)

Additional extras:
 2 additional Bolt Heads and 1 additional Bolt Body, (its best to have a spare bolt head or two)
 Additional Extractor spring. (It's good to have a spare)
 Additional Barrel Included (very hard to find, and in good condition with good bore)
 Also included the original stock (was sporterized.)

The additional extra parts are worth 150-200 dollars alone.

If they break or rip(which is highly unlikely), they can be returned for a repair or a free rig. 
The two rigs in question are in great condition, never deployed OCONUS, so they've only seen training. 

One is a ""Mookie War Rig Light"", 4 mag version, which will hold 4 AK or AR15 mags, and has PALS on the side for MOLLE pouches. Attached are a 5.11 tactical 6x6 GP pouch and a 5.11 Medical pouch. Comes with H harness, and is in coyote tan.

The other is a ""Stacked Micro Rig"", holding either 4 AK or AR15 mags in open top bungee form, with a compact tear off med kit, all in an extremely tight and small package, also in coyote tan. 

This is nearly $400 dollars worth of highly usable and highly collectable SOE gear. I'll part with both for $275 or $150 for either.

After speaking with someone from FN, more information has come to light about this particular Hi Power, and my earlier information was deemed incorrect.

This pistol is from one of the first production runs out of FN after Liege was liberated from the Germans, assembled from parts produced under German occupation but with all Liege/Allied markings (no German stamping of any sort). Based on the serial number, it was probably produced in late '44 or early '45. Smooth top slide, no rib, GI sights. Serial number is A60xx -- rare four digit with A series prefix.


I'm in no hurry to sell this as I don't really need the money or the Glock, this is just for my fun.

Includes one serial number matching 13rd FN (extremely rare type magazine with split tongue baseplate), two 13rd FN OEM mags, and two 15rd MecGar mags, Spegel style grips and original WWII grips, Israeli 1911 holster modified to fit the Hi Power, and a Hunter leather holster."

 500 Chainsaw. Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a
 pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are
 desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while
 firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around
 chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip,
 this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously
 maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to
 the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can
 be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories.

With a 60mm objective and 30mm tube, this thing grabs so much light that the sun seems to dim a bit when the lens covers are opened up.  OK, maybe that’s a bit of an exaggeration, but this is definitely a light grabber.  Though this is not an expensive higher end scope, the better light gathering really helps improve overall resolution and crispness giving decent performance for a really good price.  This scope is new in the box, removed only to get some photos.  Never mounted.

The Ace Advantage™ Composite Body Armor Vest was developed for aircrew members and other elite special operations teams who have unique missions and cockpit integration requirements that demand extraordinary consideration. These armor systems have been specifically engineered for extended wear, fully integrating with Air Ace™ load-bearing survival vests, parachute harnesses, chemical warfare ensembles, rescue recovery harnesses, and aircraft utility restraint devices. Ace Advantage ™ Composite Body Armor offers the highest degree of end-use application and aircrew equipment integration ever developed.

Ace Advantage ™ Composite Body Armor uses UDX-1000™, a patented Composite Sheet Layering System that provides level IIIA threat protection yet is lightweight and flexible. Ace Advantage ™ can be worn under or over uniforms, flight clothing, and chemical defense ensembles. It provides one-size-fits-all construction through its four-point Snap Track™ adjustment system. Snap Track™ is a revolutionary attachment device that provides 600 knot, windblast proven performance, yet offers a quick release design feature for rapid removal. This armor can be worn under the aircrew survival vest, tactical assault vest, running gear, and restraint and load bearing harness. The removable and washable body armor covers provide both front and back pockets for upgrading capability or increased trauma protection by adding Level IIIA trauma pack inserts and Level IV hard armor plates. Ace Advantage ™ armor vests also feature additional attachment points for adding optional level IIIA armor accessories including ballistic collars, for increased protection around the neck region, and groin attachments."
