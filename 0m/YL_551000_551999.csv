If you’re not familiar with these rifles they’re very desirable due to the strength of the forged billet receiver.  I’ve checked the head spacing on the bolt and it is well within tolerances.

Other info: I found this 590 sitting in my safe and since I've mostly migrated to either a BPS or Benelli, I figured someone might get some use out of it. My notes indicate it has had 137 mixed shell through the bore. This model comes with the ghost ring sights, and I had a local smith fit a heat shield around it as I found myself getting burned sometimes when I was a bit careless with short sleeves and a hot barrel. The speedfeed stock holds 4 shells, the tube magazine holds 8, and one in bore make 13 total shells. Comes with a gunsock. normal wear on shell lifter and other minor use signs, otherwise LNIB. I've installed GG&G's sling mounts and a sling will be included."

Regardless, please be comfortable with the fact that I AM OF AGE to buy/barter an AR-15, but DO NOT have a CWP (which is not mandatory anyways) before offering. If it is necessary, one of my parents would be happy to come with me and transfer the firearm to their name via Bill of Sale.

This post is for a like new TOPS Tom Brown Tracker Wilderness Survival Knife.
It has been used very little but not abused in any way.  You can see where a small amount of the coating is scuffed/rubbed on the knife.  It's not even close to being rubbed through.
I am asking $180 for the Knife and kydex sheath.  I don't have any box or papers for this knife.
I may be interested in trading for other high end knives but prefer to sell it outright.
Thank you and please let me know if you have any questions."

It has a 6.5"" barrel, free floating handguard with knurled surface, and a Phantom flash suppressor. Unlike most AR-15 pistols, this one does not need a buffer assembly so it is more compact. The lower receiver is plugged where a stock could go in order to attach a single point sling that is quick detachable.

On a side note, if Iowa would ever allow citizens to own National Firearms Act regulated items, then one could add a side folding telescoping buttstock and register the gun with the ATF as an Any Other Weapon for only $5! 

Back to the features this gun currently has; the safety, magazine release, and bolt release are all ambidextrous. Also the charging handle can be moved to either side.  The trigger guard is over sized. The red dot has a 5 MOA reticle with 11 brightness settings. An enhanced extractor with spring and insert was installed, tuned, and the gun has been fired reliably with surplus M193. A hundred or so rounds were all that has been shot through the gun and it was a blast. The recoil isn’t bad at all. The gun comes with a case, 30 round windowed PMAG, and some of the add-on items original packaging.  I also will include an OA-93 manual which is what the gun is based on.

I will put it in the back of the safe and leave it there for my grandkids and your email will not get answered. Asking $270 cash FTF prefer a CCW license and be ready for a bill of sale. If not gone by Sunday it goes back in the safe"

This gun is a Saiga 12 Russian-built shotgun, built in the same Izmash factory that builds the Russian AK47.  Mikhail Kalishnikov is one of the lead engineers at Izmash.  He's the guy that designed the AK47.  If you want a reliable, magazine-fed shotgun with outstanding parts availability and aftermarket support, the Saiga 12 is for you!  It's an awesome powerhouse.

Tromix hand guard
black polymer SAW grip
ACE folding block

The P95 is designed to be easily maintained and can be field-stripped into five major subassemblies for cleaning, without the need for special tools. The rugged steel slide is coated in Ruger's proprietary chrome-molybdenum blued steel. The matte-finished, reinforced-polymer grip frame is finished with a non-slip, textured grip with built-in picatinny rail added for convenience. The P95's high-visibility 3-Dot front and rear sights allow for quick and easy target acquisition. An ambidextrous manual safety appeals to both left and right-handed shooters and is within easy reach of either thumb."""

Info about the upper:
Less than 300 rounds through the rifle. Chambered for 5.56mm and will also fire .223 Remington. The barrel is a 16"" carbine length with a 1/9 twist, perfect for 55gr and 62gr rounds.

The upper also has a shaved low profile f stamped gas block so it will not be visible through a red dot or scope. I replaced the factory plastic hand guards with a drop in quad rail with T marks, along with the flat top receiver.

You can buy a new lower for $200, cheaper if you get on from Palmetto State on sale, and have a inexpensive, high quality AR."

This .38 Special version of the Smith 640 was made for only a few years.
S&W then went to making the .357 Mag version of this model. This .38spl 
version is sought after due to it's shorter barrel and lighter weight when
compared to the longer and heavier .357/640 model.

One of the very best snubbies ever for CCW use, and
ready for a lifetime of service.

One of my favorite aspects of this gun is the tactical adjustable rear sight.  Very few pistols have these without having to install them yourself.  It the same size and look of your normal fixed sight you see on most self defense guns, yet it's fully adjustable so you can zero it in instead of having to compensate for however it shoots out of the box.

It has the original blade bayonet, original cleaning rod, original cleaning kit, 10 stripper clips, 200 rounds of Russian match grade 7.62x39 ammo, and case. The bore is bright and shiny with strong rifling. The bluing is original and none of the pats have been painted over later. The stock is its original dark hardwood finish and has the original serial number without being forced matched and having a bunch of XXXXX's over the old serial number. The stock has no cracks or deep gouges, just minor handling wear. The receiver cover is marked with the Tula star inside the star logo and has the date stamp of 1952r under the logo. I bought this gun over a year and a half ago and it has sat in the safe ever since. I have never fired it, and never planned to in order to keep it in the collectors condition it is currently in. I know what this gun is worth as would any serious SKS collector so please don't try to low ball me and compare this with the Yugo's and Norinco's out there.

This sweet little Remington Win .270 BDL has a pretty checkered bolt and has a cut checkered Monte Carlo-style walnut stock. 

Blued finish and comes with a hinged floorplate 4-shot magazine, black forend tip and a 22"" barrel. 

It is almost like new. All you have to do is load it up for deer or elk season and you’ll be ready to go!  It is 85-90% rated. 

Less then 100 rounds through it. This has been in the family since purchased new. 

It is a Remington 700 BDL model chambered in .270. Great gun for all North American game. It shows some very light use from being in the truck, but nothing significant. 

No chips, dings, scratches, scrapes, rust, etc… 

Oh, the barrel is marked PY67. I believe that means 1974. 

The scope is a Redfield 4X TV View and has Weaver mounts. You can easily replace it with your own optics. 

I only take cash from a local face-to-face buyer and need to see a valid proof of residency (TXDL or CHL), and have you fill out a Bill of Sale. 

If the buyer is out of state or needs shipping within TX, then this would need to be handled through your FFL and applicable shipping/handling charges added at buyer expense. 

I accept bank Cashier's Check, USPS Money Order and personal checks, subject to a 10 Day Hold for the funds to clear. 

I also accept credit card payments and PayPal with a $15 added fee and you will have to fax your signature/cc number to me as authorization (for cc only) . 

Shipping via Fedex/UPS is $35 added at buyers expense.

This sweet little Remington Win .270 BDL has a pretty checkered bolt and has a cut checkered Monte Carlo-style walnut stock. 

Blued finish and comes with a hinged floorplate 4-shot magazine, black forend tip and a 22"" barrel. 

It is almost like new. All you have to do is load it up for deer or elk season and you’ll be ready to go!  It is 85-90% rated. 

Less then 100 rounds through it. This has been in the family since purchased new. 

It is a Remington 700 BDL model chambered in .270. Great gun for all North American game. It shows some very light use from being in the truck, but nothing significant. 

No chips, dings, scratches, scrapes, rust, etc… 

Oh, the barrel is marked PY67. I believe that means 1974. 

The scope is a Redfield 4X TV View and has Weaver mounts. You can easily replace it with your own optics. 

I only take cash from a local face-to-face buyer and need to see a valid proof of residency (TXDL or CHL), and have you fill out a Bill of Sale.

I also accept credit card payments and PayPal with a $15 added fee and you will have to fax your signature/cc number to me as authorization (for cc only) .

I'm a personal trainer, engineer, and prepper (yeah, strange combo).  I've been using Isagenix products myself, as well as have most of my clients use it, and the more I think about it, this is a FANTASTIC prepping item to add to your stash.

The basics of it are a meal replacement shake that you can have either with straight water, or mix with other things (I like a mix of blueberries, raspberries, peanut butter, and whole milk).  There's also soup mixes in tomato or chicken which I usually mix a bit of each.  And there's a ton of other great products.  As a distributor, I get much better prices than what's listed on the webpage, and would be happy to help the local prepping community without taking a cut.

Check out the products at http://ianjaeger.isagenix.com/us/en/home.dhtml# and if you want to try one, let me know.  I can eventually send an individual packet sampler pack (1 shake, 1 soup, 1 cookie) for a couple of bucks if you want to try before buying a box of 14.

Oh, this isn't just some diet shake mix.  While Isagenix is known for it's 9 and 30 day cleanses to help you drop weight, it's also used by elite athletes looking for a USOC / NCAA approved dietary edge."

It is a little diffrent in that the yugo crest was scrubbed off for some unkown reason. I have been told that it was possible that it was captured in the yugoslave wars and the crest was removed possibly around 1990. Either way its a fine example of a k98 and has a nice bore with strong rifling, with that said it has some frosting do to the corrosive ammo but the pics will show the strong rifling.  There are 2 waffen marks on the rifle wich are hard to see in the pictures but they are there. The rifle has been well oiled and always remains clean as the finish is worn as can see in the pic but no rust has developed. There is a nice petina on the bolt. The rifle has been fired with 5 rounds of federal ammo and has as 3.5 inch groupings at 450 yards with iron sites. Trifle comes with 570 rounds of 8mm ammo. The ammo is 16 boxes of 15 round star marked snipper ammo, 16 boxes of brown boxed 15 round yugo ammo, and 6 romanian boxes of 15 steel core rounds for a total of 570 rounds. Also included is a yugo bayonet, high quality reproduction 98k sing with the correct double hatching and stiching, original cleaning rod, 8 8mm tipton brushes,and 30 empty stripper clips. Also I have  a 1935 tula arsenal marked hex reciever mosin nagant (m91/30),these are getting harder to come by. The rifle has a nice barrel with alot of bright and strong rifling, there is 2 spots that are dark but overall its a great barrel. The stock is in original condition and has minor dings and scratches that would be common for something this age, however there are no cracks our splits. The blueing is in great condition and there are only small nicks on the metal in a few spots. The rifle comes with a sling, bayonet, oil canister, ammo pouch, and tools to service the the mosin nagant. This rifle is black powder marked and again is a hex reciever with a strong bore. This is a great deal and hate to offer both of them for trade but just purchased a nice arsenal milled bulgarian ak47 so dont wanna break the bank again with another purchase."

I put 300 rounds through it, 5 different brands, did not give me a single malfunction, every round fed, fired and ejected reliably. Previous owner says he had a lot of fluff and buff work done on it to make it reliable. Includes the P22 pistol, 3 factory magazines, the factory barrel nut wrench and a Gemtech thread adapter for use with a muzzle device such as a suppressor and the factory plastic case.

I am really only looking to trade at this time, looking for a Ruger SR22 as I like the look of that gun a little more than the Walther. Or an M&P22 since I could use that as a training tool for my full size M&P. Will also consider Sig Mosquito as a trade. Will do straight trade on the SR22 or M&P22, or cash on your end for a Mosquito. 

Cash price $330 OBO. Yes they are close to that brand new, but that is without tax and a with single magazine, you are getting 2 extra mags and the barrel adapter which would easily cost over $100."
