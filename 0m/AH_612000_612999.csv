Unfortunately it has finish issues.  It was stored improperly and grew some rust.  The rust left behind some pitting. The good part is that the inside of the barrel and cylinder were not affected by the rust, so it is purely cosmetic.

Hello!  Listed here is a BRAND NEW Yugoslavian M92 Krinkov Pistol in 7.62x39

This is LITERALLY the same gun the current Yugo military and police are using without the full auto and underfolding stock.  NOTE that inside the receiver are the original supports for the underfolder so with your SBR Tax stamp, the addition of the original underfolding stock would be quite easy.  Or you can do what I was planning which is to buy one of the kits from www.USMACHINEGUNS.com to add a TAPCO stock to it ( once your tax stamp comes in of course! )

If you have previously looked at the POS Draco’s from Romania, the M92 far surpasses the Draco in terms of quality, fit and function.

These are brand new to the market and very difficult to find.  I had plans to SBR this bad boy and make it a fire-breathing monster but life changes and I need to free up some cash 

To import these guns, the barrel has a thread protector tac-welded on.  I have already removed this tac weld and it is ready to attach an authentic Krinkov Flash Hider to it.  All that needs to be done is clean up the area that I removed the weld with a little “Simple Blue” and you are back in action.

PISTOL COMES WITH:  Everything that came from the factory.  Factory Box, Manual, cleaning rod + 2 30rnd AK Magazines with the Bolt Hold-Open Feature.

Below are several pictures however I can take more if you like.  Feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.  

CONDITIONS:
-	Feel free to make offer.  Trades, Trades + Cash etc.. worst I can say is no.
-	Face to Face only – I am in Charlotte but willing to meet if reasonable
-	This IS a pistol so CCW or Pistol Permit will be required

Hello!  Listed here is an all numbers matching Norinco SKS with the original underfolding bayonet, sling and oiler in the buttstock.

I have pulled it apart and verified that it is all number's matching from what I can tell.  Based on the research I have done, this was manufactured around 1980 and was made at the Chinese Jianshe Arsenal AKA Factory 26 as indicated in the below drawings.

From what I can tell, the gun has not been fired as the feed ramp still retains the original bluing and bore is nice and shiny.

Pictures show the condition which I would rate as good for a gun of this type and age. 

If you need any other specific photos, please let me know which ones and I can e-mail them to you.

CONDITIONS:

- Face to Face transactions only
- Feel free to make an offer:  Trade, Trade + Cash etc.  Worst I can say is no.
- This is a rifle so all I will need to see is a valid Driver's license.

This is a brand new, never fired Glock 19 that has been modified with parts from glockstore.com and amazon.com. This pistol has an extended slide release lever, extended magazine release, a polymer magwell that gives enhanced grip and smoother magazine feeding, and a beavertail adapter installed to eliminate slide bite when firing. Internally, I have installed a stainless steel guide rod and a 3.5 pound trigger connector to replace the stock polymer guide rod and 5 pound connector, respectively. I installed all of these modifications myself and I will include all the stock parts that came with the pistol so you can change the parts in the gun at your own discretion. 
In addition to everything I have listed, the gun comes with standard equipment shown in the picture: Two 15-round magazines, gun lock with two keys, speed loader, and a cleaning brush with plastic cleaning rod. I am including a nylon in-the-waistband holster, 2 boxes of Hornady critical defense 9mm ammo, and a box of Herter’s round-nose ammo. The manual and factory-fired shell casing is also included. This gun was purchased from Cabela’s and I have the original receipt to prove it. I am only interested in money as I am selling this gun because I am more than pleased with my newly purchased snub-nosed revolver and I only keep what I intend to use. I am not willing to travel more than 20 miles to make an exchange, so bear that in my if you would like to buy this pistol."

Love this gun and hate to do it.

This AR is sort of a frankenAR with a Bushmaster A1 upper and heavy chromed-lined 1/9 14.5""  barrel (16 with compensator) matched to a bare elite arms lower with DPMS internal kit. It has a UTG quadrail hand guard, Tapco collapsible stock with pad.  I bought this from a gentlemen with built this and like ten other ARs he owns. 

This rifle is extremely accurate with iron sights and I never had a feed or eject fail...it's not exactly light but it's a blast to shoot and I'd trust my life with it

Anyway, I will include a Pmag, 5 steel GI mags, soft case, sling, and 60 rds of 5.56

I'm somewhat firm on price unless you have a high end tactical knife as a partial trade to work with.  I am interested in american knives with 154cm steel or better....specifically Zero Tolerance, Spyderco, Benchmade. Keep in mind the minimum cash I will take with a knife is 500

Serial #s 17xxx made in 1913.  Nickel steel, full choke, very clean and tight.  Shoots flawlessly.

The first two years that Winchester made the Model 1912 they made only the 20 gauge.  They started producing others starting 1914.  This is one of the Original ""Perfect Repeating"" guns that begat the other Model 1912s and Model 12s later.  $700 buys you the Granfather of all Model 12s and a piece of Winchester history."

I have a pre-ban M11 in 9mm for sale.  It's confusing, so I listed all the different names people call them by in the title.  I am the only owner, and it was only shot the day of purchase (10-20 rounds).  It was cleaned and put in the safe since then and only comes out for the occassional show and tell and wipping down with rem-oil.  I have a 32 rnd mag that also comes with it.  

Other info - Stamped Cobray.  M-11/NINE mm.  Produced by S.W.D. Incorproated. SWD (Sylvia/Wayne Daniel Inc) is out of Atlanta, GA USA.  This is not a newer POS Masterpiece arms.  It was produced when the orignals were.  Serial Number starts as 89-0070XXX.  Stamped with the C for carbine.  It does shot from the closed bolt position.  The buttstock can be removed to be replaced easily with one allen head screw holding it in place.

Pistol has had minimal use, I purchased it used and I don’t think it has 50 rounds through it. The pistol has been treated with Militec-1, has had the feed ramp polished, and the sights are painted with Glow-On for good night visibility. Pistol is in very good condition, shows minimal wear, and comes with 3 9-Round magazines.
The P-40 is essentially a P-11 chambered in .40 S&W and is a real bear to shoot, when it fires you REALLY know it. The P-40 is no longer manufactured by KelTec, and will use S&W 59 Series magazines.

I am willing to sell the optic if the buyer is interested. 

Don't confuse this with a run of the mill off the shelf AR-15/M4. It is a name brand competition quality piece. It has had some trigger work done. It is much nicer than the government issued M4's I use at work. It was manufactured in Windham, Maine prior to Bushmaster being sold to a larger company.
