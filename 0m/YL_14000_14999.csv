Description: 
I have a holster Galco paddle for a HKSUP 40
also 2 thirteen rd. mags & 1 ten Rd. $25. ea.
ex.cond. all.
The M5X paddle holster is a versatile addition to Galco's line of MatrixT thermoplastic holsters. 

The durable, injection-molded Matrix line is lightweight, comfortable, and nearly maintenance free - while remaining fast in action, concealable, and easy on the budget! 

Like all Galco paddle holsters, the M5X locks solidly on the belt while still remaining easy to attach and remove. 

The M5X securely positions the handgun at the beltline with a moderate butt-forward angle, enhancing concealability yet maintaining ease and speed of draw. Twin tension units allow the user to micro-adjust the feel of the draw while retaining a proper level of firearm retention. Unlike many other harsh, mechanical-looking plastic holsters, the Matrix resembles a hand-molded Galco leather holster. The M5X paddle fits belts up to 1 3/4"". 

Made for semiautomatic pistols and double-action revolvers, the M5X is available in right and left hand designs in black finish."

The Walther G22 is a semi-automatic rifle chambered in the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. It has a bullpup design and is constructed of steel and polymer. The Walther G22 features a reversible bolt to enable cartridge ejection from either side of the receiver. It cannot be fired from the off hand due to the proximity of the ejection port and bolt handle to the shooter's face. Held by friction, a spare magazine is stored inside the stock behind the magazine well.

The Walther G22 rifle is capable of achieving shot groups as small as 0.25 inches (6.4 mm) at 55 yards (50 meters). From 500 feet away it is still possible to retain the same level of accuracy, especially when using a telescopic sight."

It comes with three magazines and lots of other extras, including a spare TPS lower scope mount. I bought the rifle brand new and have fired less than 20 rounds through it (brass cased, non-corrosive Prvi Partizan). It works perfectly. One of the magazines is in like new condition and serial numbered to the gun. The other two magazines are military surplus, used, and have light rust here and there. Also, the bayonet lug looks like it has maybe been ground (see the photos), although I don't know what one should look like. It came this way from the factory. Also, the flash hider is removable, not welded or soldered to the barrel.

This rifle is similar to a Russian Dragunov (which it is often called), but it IS NOT a Dragunov, despite how many retailers advertise them. This rifle for sale is a typical Cugir-built PSL imported by Century Arms.

Up for sale for $250 is a used 12 gauge Remington Autoloading Shotgun made in 1905 (the first year of production). This is the same as a Remington Model 11, just a different name. They were called Remington Autoloading Shotguns before Model 11. This is the same as a Browning Auto 5, just built in America before Browning sold them here under their own name. This shotgun works perfectly, although I've only shot about 10 rounds through it (#6 shot). I believe it has been refinished (or so I was told when I bought it on GB a couple years ago). It has a 28"" full choke barrel without a bead front sight. It has had a recoil pad added at some point (not by me) and, therefore, does not have the original butt plate. In fact, it looks like the butt stock and trigger group are from a later Model 11, as they are marked serial number 258099, whereas the receiver is marked 6881 (a VERY early four digit serial number). The trigger group is still very old, though, as it has the old style ""suicide"" safety. According to Remington (whom I contacted), the serial number of the receiver indicates this gun was made during the first year of production.

Here are some photos (let me know if you need additional photos): http://207.98.189.235/for_sale/mod11/

This is C&R eligible. It has to go to an FFL or C&R FFL. Shipping will be $25 via FedEx Ground (insured). Payment must be via USPS money order, or cash if you're picking it up in north Alabama.

This gun works, but it needs work.  It's got surface rust on the barrell and receiver, and the firing pin spring needs to be replaced, as it has to be pressed back in to be reset.  The mechanics still function, but the metal flanges in the handle that provide spring for the hammer and trigger need to be reinstalled by someone with knowledge.  I took them out while cleaning the gun, and don't know how to correctly reinstall them.  All the parts are present, and, like I said, with some work and cleaning, this gun is functional.

I am looking to trade this for work on another of the antique guns.  I have a Winchester Model 1897 Pump 12 that needs to be disassembled, cleaned thouroughly, and reassembled.  It works, but it's very, very rough and hard to operate.  It may need some new parts, but, it's far too complicated for me to take apart and try to mess with.  It also needs a new forearm, as this one works, but is cracked.

Tacmod stock, short action Remington 700 RATIONALE. The need for a drop in long-range modular chassis system designed around the Sniper and his mission is readily apparent. For Parachute/Air Assault, SOF and SWAT personnel specifically, the desirability of a medium to long-range complete sniper system that can be carried in a smaller package without compromising system integrity, repeatable accuracy or durability is self-evident. Further, the TACMOD Sniper Chassis System (SCS) has the advantage of being mission-configurable to any caliber or barrel length required for a given tactical situation. We further believe that this development represents a very logical product improvement for the US Army M24 Sniper Weapon System and the newer USMC M40A3 Sniper Rifle. CONCEPT. With extensive experience in shooting and modifying small arms weapon systems since 2000, and years of experience as competitive shooters and operational Sniper the designers of the TacMod SCS and The Committee Consulting applied their depth of experience in the development of the TACMOD SNIPER CHASIS SYSTEM. The TACMOD SCS is a drop in chassis for any Remington 700 action. The 700LA/SA will accept Accuracy International magazines; both will accommodate either the five or ten round versions. The chassis has a removable, round, free floated fore end two inches in diameter designed to allow end user adjustment of the included M1913 rails at the 12, 3, 6, and the 9 o'clock positions. The ""fore-tube"" can also be ordered in different lengths to fit any operator, barrel length or tactical mission. The chassis folds behind the pistol grip to the left and locks, allowing unimpeded operation of the bolt handle and fire controls for immediate use in the compact configuration. The pistol grip on the SCS is interchangeable with any M16/ M4 style pistol grip. The butt stock is fully adjustable for length of pull and cheek height insuring user level fitting for maximum range of personal. The butt stock is also interchangeable with any M16/M4 or M110 style butt stock to multiply its variety of combat uses. Our goal was to improve the overall fit and feel of the current sniper systems of today while providing a modular platform that can be installed, configured for missions, and serviced at the user level while maintaining zero. The SCS was also engineered to use low rings and bases for optic day sight mounting to keep the optic as low to the bore as possible. The TSCS is made of the highest quality aircraft grade 7075 T6 aluminum, hard coat anodized for lightweight and strength.

This gun fires from the open bolt position & basically slam-fires. Because of this design, it was banned from production in 1981. The Cobray 32rd mags are Beretta .380acp mags that the current Cobray company welds a piece of steel to the back of, to allow use of the M11's mag-release. Because they were finished in some kind of acrylic, I had them stripped & refinished by Red Jacket Firearms. RJF used the same finish they apply to their AKs.

Updated listing on 11-20-09

For Sale or Trade: AR-15_A1 5.56 mm Pre-Ban
Asking $1,500 or trade for a larger caliber AR-10 (.308, .450, .458, .50).
This AR is not for everyone.  It is a collectors item.  There are a few people out there who understand what an early issue pre-ban is and understand my price for this AR. Serious inquiries only.

Upper: Colt 20-inch barrel 1:9 twist w/ bayonet lug. Barrel marked ""C MP Chrome Bore""; C for the manufacturer Colt, MP stamp means the barrel was magnafluxed and proofed, chrome bore and chamber. Bolt Carrier manufacturer stamp ""Shield (8 sided octagon) and SE""; Smith Enterprise.

Lower: PWA (Pac West Arms, Milan, Ill.; this was the early LMT company I believe and Rock River Arms bought out PWA. From everything that I have heard they are excellent lowers!) 5.56mm Commando. This is a forged lower not cast. Serial# 11174. (PWA post-ban have a year prefix in the serial number. The serial # cutoff was 35222 for preban status).

Standard two point sling.
Has a new AR-16 cleaning kit (Small Arms Maintenance Equipment Case 8465-00-781-9564).
A1 stock w/ butt storage compartment. 
Have one USA 30 round AR-15 .223 magazine by O'Kay Industries, Inc., New Britain, Conn.

This AR is in great shape and supreme working order. I had it fully serviced (new parts, fired & cleaned) by a gunsmith at Anderson's Gun Repair Shop here in Springfield, MO before putting it up for sale; new extractor spring & gas tube (had a dent in the tube which slowed the gas pressure). I also run some 40 rounds through it and cleaned it. It was flawless.

I've had this same rifle (but fully auto - M16) issued to me during the latter part of the Vietnam conflict (U.S. Army 1971-74). I hate to part with this, but with the times as they are now I would prefer a much larger caliber for home defense. Not worried about whether or not you can hunt with it.

Let me know what you have and I'll see if we can come to an agreement."

Japanese Characters on the Arisaka Rifle
Japanese Rifle Manufacturer: Toyo Kogyo 1939-1945
Type: 99
Type 99 rifle was adopted in Japanese calendar year 2599 (1939)
Series : 30

The Japanese manufactured over 6.4 million rifles and carbines in the 40 years from 1906 to 1945. Most of these rifles were still in use during the Sino-Japanese War of the 1930s and the Pacific War of the 1940s. During the war and subsequent American occupation of Japan, thousands of these rifles found their way to the United States as war souvenirs.
The Arisaka rifles are named for Colonel Nariaki Nariakira Arisaka, who headed a commission during the 1890s which was charged with developing a new rifle to replace the earlier models such as the Murata. The Arisaka rifles were designated with the year of the current emperor's reign. Thus, the Type 38 rifle was designed in the 38th year of the reign of Emperor Meiji (1905), and the Type 44 carbine was adopted in the 44th year of his reign (1911). During the reign of Hirohito, rifles were designated by the last one or two digits of the adoption year according to the standard Japanese calendar. Thus, the Type 99 rifle was adopted in Japanese calendar year 2599 (1939), and the Type 2 paratroop rifle was adopted in calendar year 2602 (1942).
A chrysanthemum with 16 petals (the symbol of the Japanese Emperor) was usually stamped on the receiver of rifles manufactured for the Imperial Japanese Army, indicating that the rifle belonged to the Emperor. The chrysanthemum resembles this:

The chrysanthemum was at least partially ground off on rifles which were surrendered after the war, apparently as a face-saving gesture. Rifles captured in the field, however, normally have the chrysanthemum symbol intact. The Type designation was stamped into the top of the receiver using the character shiki for ""type"" and Japanese numerals.

(On this rifle the chrysanthemum has been ground off, it was surrendered after the war)"

Other wise it shows no signs of visible wear, the action is smooooooth as butter and the cylnder locks up tight and spins smooth when ejected.

from the CMMG website:

The upper is built off of our standard forged A3 receiver with M4 feed ramps. The chrome plated gas piston is mounted in a solid one piece steel gas block attached to the barrel by pins. The dedicated, piston specific, anti-tilt bolt carrier is one piece, machined with the piston impingement key(not a bolt on). The carrier uses our standard bolt or any after market 5.56 bolt. The barrel is our 4140 steel, M4 profile, 5.56mm chamber and bore, 1/9 twist ratio and 1/2x28 threaded barrel and our proprietary WASP surface treatment. The upper is finished with M4 handguard caps, M4 handguards and an A2 flash hider installed with a crush washer. Our piston rifles utilize our standard forged mil-spec lower with mil-spec fire control group and take-down pins and mil-spec 6 position ribbed, reinforced stock.

The piston gas block has a gas shut off setting for use with a suppressor to allow for maximum noise reduction. You must replace the crush washer with a peel washer if you plan to mount your suppressor on the original flash hider. All rifles have been factory head spaced and test fired. Included with firearm is 1-30rd mag, manual and lifetime warranty. There is no rear sight with this model. There are no upgrade options available with this model."

CUSTOM GUN LEATHER - Hand made by WM. Brown Holster Company of Tombstone, Arizona. I shot NCOWS, and this is legal for their requirements.
Designed from the book ""Packing Iron"".
Belt is a money belt that is 4 inches wide, very supple leather, cartridge loops hold 357 and 38 call ammo, adjust for a wide range 
about 36"" to 44"" waist sizes. Beautiful reddish brown color.
Tasteful border tooling. Right handed holster is matched in color to the
belt. Nice border tooling matches also. Holds up to a 5 1/2"" barreled Colt
or a copy, as well as new and old Ruger Vaqueros.
Shotshell belt, also made by same company. I had this made to NOT match the belt and holster. Holds 20 gauge shells. Not sure of the size range.
I had it made to wear around the chest for a ""gamer"", but I have worn it around my waist too. I'd guess it fits up to a 44' or 46"" waist.

The Walther G22 is a semi-automatic rifle chambered in the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. It has a bullpup design and is constructed of steel and polymer. The Walther G22 features a reversible bolt to enable cartridge ejection from either side of the receiver. It cannot be fired from the off hand due to the proximity of the ejection port and bolt handle to the shooter's face. Held by friction, a spare magazine is stored inside the stock behind the magazine well.

The Walther G22 rifle is capable of achieving shot groups as small as 0.25 inches (6.4 mm) at 55 yards (50 meters). From 500 feet away it is still possible to retain the same level of accuracy, especially when using a telescopic sight."

I have a very beautiful Colt MK III Trooper .357 mag with a 4"" barrel, awesome condition original wood grips and near perfect blue finish, also has adjustable rear sights and front blade. I would rate the entire gun at 95-97% due to the two small spots of surface pitting that can be easily buffed out with fine steel wool. Other wise it shows no signs of visible wear, the action is smooooooth as butter and the cylnder locks up tight and spins smooth when ejected. I aquired this fine Colt and do not know the round count but from inspection of the bore and overall condition of the finish I would say it was NEVER carried, and rarely shot. I do not have the box or paperwork. I am selling for $400. She is truly Amazing!
