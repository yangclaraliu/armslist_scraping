From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the U.S. Armed Forces have counted on Beretta pistols for almost two decades of distinguished service. The 92FS, Beretta’s premier full metal gun, most resembles the military M9 9mm pistol. Accurate out of the box, this workhorse features an open slide design that vir tually eliminates jamming, a safety system that combines decocking with a positive thumb safety, and a combat muzzle crown. Beretta’s proprietary black, non-glare Bruniton finish gives your 92FS a wear-resistant coating, which means it will stand up to any special duty.

I got on a waiting list for it a year ago back when I wanted a new handgun.  In the meantime, I have purchased several hand guns, and this one finally came in, and I don't really need it, but bought it anyway.

Bought this gun used from a FFL Dealer about 3 months ago. It has a very small nick on the left side of the frame when I bought it(see photo link) but it does not affect the performance of the gun at all. I've probably put about 300 rounds through it with no issues. I'm selling it because I want to get a Tanfoglio Witness Match 40s&w.

This is a FTF only transaction and I'm located in Vienna, VA. A VA DL is required. We would both get a copy of a signed Bill of sale. I have attached the bill of sale below so please check the restrictions on the top part of the form before contacting me. Thank you.

Check out the website for all the details on the design features if you aren't familiar with it.

This is the upgraded version with the stainless steel slide, not the basic one so it's more expensive retail.  Comes with two mags and a Pearson grip pinky extender on the short mag, modified Hogue anatomic grip (rubber & removable) .  Complete kit as shown on the site: holster, 2 mag holster, loader, lock, plastic case.  All original paperwork.

***Comes with Laserlyte rear sight laser*** I'm not crazy about this laser but it's on there and works.  I'm not adding anything to the price for the laser.  The original 3 dot sight is included if you want to re-install it (brass punch included).  I will say that the laser could use some new windage/elevation screws (very tiny and so small the allen wrench barely grips and no torque), not very easy to sight in.  The screws are available from Laserlyte.  It's yours to do with what you want.  Personally, if I were keeping the pistol I'd go ahead and splurge to get a green rail laser or Crimson Trace grip laser.   So...no complaints about the laser.  It's yours to resell if you don't like it.  

See info here:

http://www.laserlyte.com/products/rtb-xd

As seen in the pics; practice ammo included but shipped separately.  Approximately 400+ rounds.

For the nitty gritty.  I will ONLY use an FFL to sell/transact through. NO FTF W/O FFL. Period.   If I'm shipping then it's $28 for shipping from my FFL to your FFL. You can fax/email/mail your FFL info straight to mine.  If local then then I'll pay my FFL transfer fee and you can p/u from my FFL.   I'll ship the ammo separately by UPS and I'll pay shipping.   I'll give you the number, etc., after payment clears.  

I have references available if you are leary about internet classifieds.   

I will accept CC#, money order, certified check and cash.  That's it.  Credit card MUST be in the same name as buyer, no exceptions.  You can text/email/call your CC# to me.  I'll need CC# & CCV#, Exp date. 

$425 for all (plus shipping if shipped $458)  FIRST PAYER GETS IT---NO HOLDS.  

Add it up and that's $160+ bucks for ammo.  You are going to have to buy ammo anyway and that makes the pistol just $265!  If you end up liking the Lazerlyte laser that's $154 retail and drops the price to $111 for the pistol.  If you can't see the deal here I give up and will gladly keep this gun and just hide it from the Mrs.'s"

Now for me, I'd like to trade for an AK 74. Preferably the M&M M10 545x39 and we'll call it even. Just let me know what you have. As for cash, I'm pretty much firm depending on who does most of the driving. I check my email regularly."

Obviously, with the barrels cut off, (the lower one had been damaged and I cut it off behind the damage), there is no choke but at the ranges that the blue rock were shot, it was not an issue. In fact, it helped them hit better because of the spread of the pattern.

They have each been shot approximately 10 times. The rifle has never been in the field. 
Both are in excellent condition with beautifully figured Walnut hardware. You rarely see ML like these nowadays. 
The pistol was only produced for a short time, and they are difficult to find. 
They would be a great addition to any collection. 
The holster was made for the pistol by John M. Walker of Little Rock. 
As you can see in the picture, it is very well made, and it is just as practical as it is good looking.

The price on the combo is $800.
I am really looking to sell the set, but if you want to break on of them out: 
I will sell the pistol belt/holster for $450. 
I will sell the Rifle by itself for $450.

I will consider a nice .243 bolt action (with or without optics) as a partial trade.

Even when lighting conditions are far from perfect, the optics are brilliant and crystal clear. The focus and parallax adjustment ring seems custom-fitted to your fingertips, even when you're wearing gloves. Signature Select scopes simply are everything a shooter could want, and more.

Beyond using some of the world's best glass, the optical excellence comes from the fact that the internal lenses have surface areas 65% larger than most other 1-inch tube scopes. They are actually significantly larger than most scopes with 30mm tubes. Pair that with our index-matched Hi-Lume multi-coatings and you appreciate why Signature Selects out-perform scopes costing hundreds of dollars more.

Description:

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

The upper has exactly 0 rounds through outside being test fired at the factory, and is in brand new condition. It was attached to a lower and left sitting.

It will come with everything it came with from the factory, standard handguards, bolt carrier group, etc. In the factory box.

$425 for just the basic upper. 

For $650 I will add in Knights Armament Company M4 Rail system, this comes with the original packaging, vertical fore grip, and all the rail panels that come with it. These are the same rails the military use on their M4 rifles. The upper will also come with an A2 carry handle/rear sight. 

I'm selling it to help with school bills and a car down payment. Since I haven't shot it, I obviously don't NEED it even though I would like to keep it. 

This is for the upper only, not the complete rifle.

Nice Russian SKS Tula Arsenal 1953, all matching numbers, hardwood stock, excellent brite bore, shoots, feeds & ejects perfectly, early KBI import. Complete with KBI manual/brochure, cleaning rod and etc. Great Shooter, always cleaned and non-corrosive ammo used. presently have a butt pad installed, however, original screw and butt plate is there (butt pad was installed over the top, takes 2 seconds to remove if you want original). This is a ex-DDR ( Has the stock and hand guard marks and the /1\). pre-94 import. half a dozen of stripper clips will be included, also there is a cleaning kit in a butt stock.
last few on gunbroker in this condition and vintage fetch close to 500-$600 plus shipping plus ffl fee. 

with this sale you will be getting exactly 950 rounds of WOLF 154gr SP ammo (kind you can't get anymore) which I removed from the boxes a while back and separated into ziplocks and into a box.

As far as  ammo, if you can find it (black box Wolf, Non-corrosive, non-re-loadable), it goes now for about 40c a round (as it is the best hunting weight), before it disappeared it was $469MSRP for 1000rounds; so I think this is a fair price for a quick sale(give or take $420 rifle and $380 ammo, or whatever way you want to swing it :) )
and yes, that pouch with cleaning bottle and a sling are all part of the deal :).

This is a custom upgraded TRP.  The TRP was purchased new Jan 2012 from a local dealer - ran through 300 rounds then immediately sent to SA's Custom Shop for a complete overhaul. The work was performed by their top gunsmith Dave Williams who has been featured in multiple 1911/pistol magazines.  All of the upgrades carry SA's lifetime warranty.  The pistol had 0 failures, I simply wanted to customize it.  I received it back 2/5/2012 and have 380 rounds through it. It has been upgraded to the TRP-PRO or ""Professional."" X300 is not included.

Just make an offer, if you know guns you know what I have here is not junk so please no low ball offers. Will listen to all trade offers as well. Had rifle priced at Predator Custom Shop at $2200.00, if in the market they would have offered $1700.00."

Barrett Model 99 package which includes Pelican Hard Case, Barrett Rings and Bushnell Tactical Scope.



[b]From Barrett:[/b]
Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 optics rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match-toleranced barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a rock-solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. The chamber area is encased by the thick-walled aluminum extrusion of the receiver, resulting in unparalleled safety for the shooter.

The bolt is machined from a single piece of shock-resistant tool steel. The action’s strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt’s few moving parts, an extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly, make it reliable and easy to maintain.

The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is exclusive to Barrett and virtually maintenance-free. The bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting.

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 combines smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot.

Two of the magazines are the standard 10 round mags and one magazine is a 17 round magazine with a sleeve extension to make it a full size SR9 grip with the full size capacity (great for range shooting or home defense). The gun does have a manual thumb safety as well as a trigger safety, mag disconnect, and loaded chamber indicator.

I carried this gun only a handful of times and it is quite comfortable. It is also just big enough to be enjoyable at the shooting range. This gun is the perfect all around 9mm for range shooting, home defense, or concealed carry. I have babied this gun and it is in VERY good condition. I love this gun and it functions perfectly, but my Glock 26 has taken over for carry duty and I want a full size/full length target gun so I don't have a use for the SR9c anymore. I will miss it though. I would not sell this gun if it had any issues or flaws.

Buyer must have a permit to purchase or a concealed weapons permit (not legally necessary but I would prefer either of these)."

The upper is a 16"" PSA midlength gas system.  The barrel is a 1x7 chrome lined barrel.  It has an ""F"" mark front sight post.  The barrel contour is the light weight version.  Holding this rifle compared to my main rifle, the difference is quite noticeable.  This was going to be my K.I.S.S./Lightweight rifle so it has real basic furniture.  The two upgraded peices are the MOE grip and he MOE trigger gaurd.  

The lower was a unit from Surplus Arms & Ammo.  This is a regular lower with the bullet pictogram for fire selections.  The lower parts kit was from PSA.  It has a normal single stage trigger.  The buffer/spring assy are also from PSA.

There is currently a flip up back up sight(BUIS) from a company called Matech on it.  This is the standard issue Army flip up sight.  If you would like to find your own rear sight, that is ok, we can work that out.

I ran to the range to test this rifle and make sure there were no snags.  I fired 10 rounds of .223 and 10 rounds of 5.56.  Both calibers functioned flawlesly.  I fired both slow rate and fast rates of fire and there were no problems.  This rifle funstions %100 and very smooth.  The reason I am selling is because my third build has arrived and the Dissipator is the one I am truly in love with.
