This is essentially a survey.  I have been thinking about marketing a pistol kit tailored toward the average citizen that wants some peace of mind.  This kit would include a gen 3 glock with custom stippling and tac-light, soft armor vest (IIIA) with pistol holster and mag pouches, 4 mags total, and 500 rounds of ammunition.  This gives them a decent gun with a light, something to grab in the middle of the night that will provide some limited protection and reloads, as well as enough ammo to get some practice and/or taining in.  All for $1000

The other option I have looked at is essentially the same, but the cost would be $1200, instead of a glock an AR-15, and instead of a vest it would be a 6 mag pouch with 7 mags included.

Proper defense ammunition would be up to them as everyone has their own preference.  Let me know if you think people would purchase such a kit to get them started, or if you think that this is a horrible idea.

Of course if anyone is interested in such a kit right now, let me know and I will see what I can do!

I only took it to the range once and zombie66 was with me so if you want to cross-check my round count ask him.  I shot maybe 100 rounds through it, then ran a boresnake through it three times and wiped everything down with a silicone shop rag.

The only modification to the gun was installing the ClipDraw, which is awesome.  The clip itself has been engraved with the name ""Valentine"", sorry if it bothers you but I thought it was funny at the time (geek joke).

Gun comes with the ClipDraw installed and the original parts in a ziploc baggie, one 10-round factory magazine, one box of MAgTech 230gr. FMJ ammo, and all the original papers, manuals, warranty info, and the still-sealed baggie with the proof casing.  Does not have the box or cleaning rod.

The 25-06 Remington barrel shoots very well. I've only shot 25 rounds through the barrel to sight it in. It shot MOA groups with 115gr Berger VLDs. It was the first load I tried and never went any further. The barrel has great potential with the right loads. I never shot factory ammo.

The 223 Remington barrel: Can't say much about it because I've never had it on the gun but it is in ""As New"" condition. The person I bought it from said he shot less than 20 rounds through it. He bought a Rem 700 in 223 and never shot this barrel again.

I've got bolt guns in both these calibers so I'm selling this package to fund another project. 

Asking Price: $825.00 OBO for the assembled 25-06 Rifle, the .223 barrel, and (3) Hinge Pins. Both barrels come with Scope Mounts.

I can build you a custom AR-15 rifle or assemble yours for you!

Prices are as follows: (Please note that these are custom AR’s and not off the shelf toys. The COLT and USGI quality is there and reliable) Shop around and compare prices and you will see that these are reasonable! Can you beat USGI quality and reliability?

These are NEW guns and built exactly how you want.

$700 for a M4 style AR-15 (Flat top upper w/o detachable carry handle and rear sight). Upper and all internals will be USGI and the lower will be Spikes. 16"" barrel. M4 stock (4 position). G.I. Handguards. Barrels are not chrome lined 4150-keeping cost down and accuracy up). Sling and magazine are not included in price. These are for the individuals that want an AR, do not want the carry handle/rear sight and want to utilize a scope and no iron sights.

$750 for a M4 style AR-15 (Flat top upper w/ carry handle and rear sight). Upper and all internals will be USGI and the lower will be Spikes. 16"" barrel. M4 stock (4 position).  G.I. Handguards. Barrels are not chrome lined (4150-keeping cost down and accuracy up). Sling and magazine are not included in price. These are ideal for that modern military look with iron sights. Scope mounting can be done with proper mount.

$800 for a M16 style (AR15A2) AR-15. Upper and all internals will be USGI. Lower will be Spikes. 16"" barrel. Fixed position stock. Sling and magazine are not included in price. This classic look is what our boys carried in Vietnam and has the fixed stock. No adjustability here for length of pull.

$850 for a M16 style (M16A2) AR-15. Upper and all internals will be COLT G.I. Lower will be Spikes. Sling and magazine are not included in price. Same style as above but COLT internals. 20"" M16A2 full length heavy profile 5.56mm 1-9 twist barrel. Fixed position stock.

PLEASE NOTE: If you wish to have a different lower used than the above mentioned Spikes, please tell us and we can get you a price on that build!

We can also add any options you would like. Please note this in your email and a price quote will be given.

M4 style rifle is pictured first and the M16 style rifle is pictured second

Do you have an AR rifle kit and you’re not mechanically inclined or don’t want to buy tools that you won’t ever use again!? Another service we are offering is AR-15 rifle assembly. Full rifle assembly for $100! Yes, $100 – that’s roughly half of what any other location will charge you. Other assembly services are offered! Please email with a specific request and I’ll get you a price a.s.a.p!!

If you’re interested, don’t delay and send me an email with any questions you may have. Note: I cannot warranty any guns due to not knowing what conditions they are going to be used in and to what extent. I will provide a 1 week functionality warranty to which we will replace any internals that might break (not that it will happen, but parts occasionally have bad days…)

Payment options are CASH or firearm trades. Trades must be of equal value of rifle MINIMUM! 50% rifle cost due at build contract agreement. Final 50% due when rifle is complete. Customer will be called once rifle is done and given 1.5 weeks to claim rifle. If rifle is not claimed during this time, both rifle and 50% down payment will be forfeited to builder and rifle will become our property. Face to Face meeting WILL be required and MN DL and copy of Permit to Purchase or  CCW permit is REQUIRED! No sales tax. Private party sale to private party.

Basically, we want to build you the AR15 YOU want and do not want to get stuck with the bill. We all want one of these rifles but do not know what kind of quality we are getting for a “big box gun”. Sure, you can spend $1,000+ for an AR but let’s be real when I say most of us can’t/won’t pay that for a fun gun."

i baught this shotgun from a family member so i know that it has always been kept safe clean and oiled.  this gun has also been shot very little.  myself i have only put about 100 shells through it.  as for my relative, he told me that he cleaned the gn more then he shot it.  

this gun has a beautiful stock with matching forearm.  the action is tight but smooth and has not developed the sloopy loose actions that a lot of over unders are known for.  recoil but pad is in great shape.  it has 28 inch barrels that are vent ribbed and have a bead sight.  the upper barrel is set up with a full choke tube and the bottom barrel has a modified choke tube.  the barrels are blued and the bluing is in excellent condition.  this is a single trigger gun.  the bottom barrel shoots first but a simple ""bump"" of the trigger will make the gun fire the top barrel first instead.  the safety engages every time the gun is broke open.  you can even set the barrels to eject the spent shells everytime you open the gun or by turning a small screw, you can turn the ejector ""off"".  also i have a second forearm that i picked up at a gun show for this gun too.

i had my gun smith look the gun over and asked him to rate the gun.  he told me that the gun has no problems of any kind and is in perfect working order.  in his opinion, he has rated this gun as great to excellent condition.  

i have seen a few of these on gun broker and other various websites.  these are becomming harder to find and after shooting one i can see why.  this is a great over under and has a lot of the features that much much more expensive shotguns are expected to have.

i am looking to sell or trade this gun outright becasue i just do not shoot it enough and have plenty of shotguns."

With that said you must obey the law by making sure under NC Law that who you sell to has a ccw or a purchase permit and it should go on the bill of sale. If you don't do a bill of sale you are really putting yourself in jepoardy.

Do you really want a lost or stolen handgun used in crime traced back to you without a bill of sale as proof that it is no longer your gun? In NC even a handgun gifted to a family member must be supported by a ccw or purchase permit from the spouse, brother, sister that you give it to.

The stock is a polymer folder that also has an adjustable cheek riser...the grip has a storage compartment for batteries etc.  The rail is FAB's own design for the VZ-58 and is made from aircraft aluminum and T marked.  The muzzle brake comes from NEIT arms.  The color on the rifle is flat dark earth.  Rail covers included as well as a 30rd VZ mag.  These rifles are NOT stamped but milled receivers..and still lighter than an AK variant.  They use a short stroke piston, falling block design.  Very cool rifles that are hard to find, especially with these expensive accessories.  I have fired 2 mags thru this to verify function.  NO TRADES!"

The changes to note from the Steyr Aug to the STG 556; bolt forward assist, three position safety, visible from all angles, ability to use left handed bolt, bolt catch for fast reloads. The STG 556 was redesigned from the ground up in the USA, by Microtech Small Arms Research.

The Bullpup design allows for faster point and shot techniques as well as aiding in long distance accuracy. This innovation leads to higher precision due to the length of the barrel, and more accurate fit in the user’s body. The MSAR STG 556 rifle uses almost identical specs as the Steyr Aug."
