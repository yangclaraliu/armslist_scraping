Below is a summary from Sig's website

The P226 Combat with threaded barrel is designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards. The P226 Combat performs like no other .9mm available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the threaded barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P226 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Outfitted with a true M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights."

As you can see from the pictures, it is in very good condition and a very rare item. The serial number of the rifle is 203167. Unfortunately, the amount of photos allowed in the listing are limited but some of the markings and stampings on the weapon are as follows: the serial number  203167(stamped at the end of the trapdoor), there is a 38A stamped into the wood at the rear of the hammer, there is a VP an eagle head and another P stamped into the metal on the left side of the barrel in front of the trapdoor, model 1873 crossed arrows and US is stamped into the metal in front of the trapdoor, and finally there is the words US Springfield and an eagle on the right side under the hammer. The rear sight is original and fully functional and it also still has the original shoulder sling ring on the front of the trigger guard. The only visible damage to the rifle are some scratches and gouges in the wood on the stock (the majority of the damage is on the left side of the weapon.) It also comes with a wood storage box (manufactured by the Naval Company), two of the brass projectiles, 1 unused bundle of string, an extra canister (that mounts onto the weapon), and 3 live rounds to fire the projectile.

I have a 37mm slam fire launcher. Slam fire means you fire it by sliding the rear pistol grip forwards. It comes with 12 ultra strong nylon reloadable hulls (4 are not shown), Two Red Flare hulls, and a 8"" long aluminum hull, Four 37mm super breaker explosive mortar rounds which are SUPER LOUD (completely legal, was purchased at local gun shop several years ago), Eight 37mm standard size explosive mortar rounds (also SUPER LOUD), and One Red Flare Round. ALL ROUNDS SHOOT APROX. 150' - 200' Before Exploding. SEE PHOTO BELOW. It is not legal to use adapters for firing .410 shotgun shells or other adaptors for firing pistol rounds in the launcher until you get it engraved w/serial # and registered. The launcher is completely legal in it's current state, because it is a 37mm signaling device. The entire launcher is constructed of solid steel, and is guaranteed to be more durable than any other 37mm launcher on the market! You can load your own 37mm shells easily with the nylon hulls, a #209 shotgun primer, some FFFG black powder, and some pyrotechnical knowledge :) . This is a great launcher, I am just thinning down my toys! A lot of fun on New Years Eve & 4th of July! The Signal Flares and Hulls alone are worth over $200.00"

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine."

The Ruger MK II is a rimfire single-action semi-automatic pistol chambered in .22 Long Rifle and manufactured by Sturm, Ruger & Company. Ruger rimfire pistols are some of the most popular handguns made, with over three million sold. The MK II (""Mark Two"") was made from 1982 to 2005. Previous models include the Standard, Ruger's first model, made from 1949 to 1982, and the MK I Target, made from 1951 to 1982. MK II variations include the Target models, which have heavier barrels and adjustable sights, and the 22/45 models, which have a polymer frame with a grip-angle that matches the Colt 1911 rather than the steel frame's Luger P08-like layout. The MK II was removed from production in 2004, when it was replaced by the MK III. All Ruger rimfire pistols are chambered in .22 Long Rifle only."

It ran great. The only problem I'm having right now is that the bolt sometimes does not lock back after the last round is fired. I'm not sure if it's because of my upper is short stroking or if it's because of the lower, but I do have a new bolt catch (+new detent, spring and roll pin) included with this sale. I also got rid of the polymer front and rear take down pin and included are steel take down pins (the rear is an oversize take down pin so it's easier to pull out).

The top rail is 2pc full length, from flash hider to charging handle. The forearm is a floating (doesn't touch the barrel) 4 rail that is heavily vented. It also has 3 rail covers so you can hold it comfortably without an attached grip. It has a deep flash hider (like the flaming pig). The bolt carrier has the longer rear rail to keep the bolt action more reliable. The forward assist works. This lower is legally a handgun. I can sell that separately if you want it.

I took it out and test fired it's first 20rds. The 9.5"" upper I used to have kicked like a small mule. This one at 7.5"" rides VERY smooth to the point I didn't believe the first shot. My friend shot better with this than his own .40cal handgun and said it was because his kicks harder.
It's an amazingly smooth shooter. But my (ex!) girlfriend doesn't get to keep it so I'm selling it.

Private sale, cash purchase. If you buy the lower then like a gun show, show you live in state.

The rifle has a beautiful stock, and it comes with a meuller APT Tactical mildot scope (4.5-14x40AO).  The scope is mounted to the rifle using a set of quick connect Leupold scope rings.  I have all of the paperwork for the rifle and the scope, and the rifle will come with a plastic hard case.

the rifle has a spiral fluted stainless steel bull barrel, and comes with the adjustable Savage accutrigger.

I originally put this package together for target shooting at fairly long range (well long range for a .22) I have no problem hitting a target the size of a golf ball at 100yds every shot. The rifle holds five in the clip, plus one in the chamber.  It has had less than 50 rounds through it, and is always cleaned after use. 

I am selling the Rifle because I no longer have the time to go to the range as often (new job) so hopefully someone else can enjoy this as much as I have.

 This is a flat top M4 Law enforcement edition rifle with a 16 inch 1 in 7 twist chrome moly 4150 barrel (harder steel than the 4140 standard milspec barrels) and a midlength gas system. This rifle sports the Magpul MOE handgaurds, 3 Magpul PMAGS, and a Magpul MBUS rear pop up sight. The Bolt carrier group is the M16 full auto which is heavier duty than the standard  one found on most milspec guns (Still a semi auto gun and totally legal) Also has an extra power extractor spring for improved reliability and comes with a brand new in the package Wolf extra power action spring and standard buffer along with the standard spring and h2 buffer currently installed which make this rifle sweet to shoot.

 Bought the complete upper and complete lower separately brand new 1 month ago!  Selling because I opted to stick with my AK and build up ammo instead of focusing on two separate calibers.  Very well researched choice for an AR.

 Lower receiver is from Stag and is marked 5.56 caliber. Inside is a CMMG lower parts kit, and Bravo Company H2 buffer. The trigger spring is a Wolf reduced power spring for smoother trigger pull.  This gun features an adjustable 6 position stock with mil spec buffer assembly.  Pistol grip is an ATI with Scorpion recoil reducing pad, very comfortable to grip and shoot.

The following is from Joe Bob outfitters website;
    Upper Specs-
    -Spike's Tactical M4 flat top upper receiver, Machined from a 7075 T6 Mil-Spec Forging with Mil-Spec Type III Hardcoat Anodized finish, T-markings,Spike's Tactical logo and M4 feed ramps.
    -Barrel is 4150 Chromoly Vanadium Alloy, M4 barrel extention, Chrome chamber and bore, 5.56mm Nato chamber, 1:7 Twist, Magnetic particle testing on every barrel, Phosphate finish.
    -Government Contour with Mid-length gas system.
    -Mid-length hand guards w/Triangle hand guard cap.
    -Barrel is Phosphate finished under the F marked A2 front sight base.
    -Barrel is HP Tested & MP Inspected
    -The M16 carriers are Chrome lined with a Mil-Spec phosphate finish.

    -Forged Mil-Spec carrier key, Chrome lined, attached with Grade 8 hardware and Properly staked.
    -MP tested bolt, Each extractor is fitted with a Mil-Spec black insert and Mil-Spec Viton o-ring.
    -Forged Mil-Spec charging handle.
    -A2 Flash Hider.



 Included in sale are 3 black 30 round Magpul PMAGS loaded with Tula Steel cased ammo, Magpul MBUS pop up rear sight, a Blackhawk Tactical carry bag,  and a black strap, extra Wolf action spring and standard buffer.  Brand new after tax and shipping this rifle cost well over $1000, so it's a great deal.  When you buy one off the shelf at Academy or the like you pay more and get way less, so this is your gun if you are a wise buyer

Not looking to trade as I need cash to fund various ammo and reloading needs as well as some money to bank.  Local sales only to Tn. residents 18 or older who are legal to purchase long guns, and no low ball offers as I am not desperate to sell.

As for trades I'm most interested in a commander size 1911 from a quality maker (Colt, Kimber, Sig, S&W, Les Baer, Dan Wesson....etc) Id prefer it be a more modern 1911...beavertail, good sights, extended thumb safety. All offers will be considered, but i'm probably gonna hold out for a nice 1911.....Not interested in a full size 1911 at this time, i have too many of those.

If you have something (or several somethings) that I take a liking to, I will probably give you a very reasonable trade deal on the bike.

First, the bad news:
- Comes with Trijicon night sights, but the tritium tubes are dim
- Finish on the backstrap is almost entirely worn away, but the frame is aluminum so no worry about rust and minimal risk of other corrosion

Now, the good news:
- Installed lightened 16-lb hammer spring from Wolff Gunsprings for lighter and smoother double-action trigger
- Installed new extractor assembly (claw, spring, and pin)
- Comes with SIX 15-round magazines (non-factory).  All work fine, never had any misfeeds
- Comes with Hogue rubber panel grips for better grip traction than factory grips (factory grips also included with extra set of grip screws)
- Comes with a single-handgun carrying case.  Nothing special, but just a little extra.
- Comes with three holsters, a Gcode XST holster with belt-slide, a Serpa holster with paddle, and a high ride belt holster. All are suitable for competition if you are so inclined.

This gun has fed and fired thousands of rounds reliably and will do so for thousands more.  The lighter hammer spring has not given me any problems with light primer strikes; every trigger pull on a loaded chamber goes bang.

$500 OBO. FTF cash sale only in SW Houston area.  TX drivers license required, CHL preferred.

It is set up as a ""dissapator"" and has longer rifle length handguards that give you more space for accessories, as well as a longer sight radius, all without making the gun heavier or less maneuverable. It combines the best parts of the Carbine and adds them to the best parts of the rifle, making a gun that is not just better looking than an M4 style firearm, but better performing.

   The chrome lined E.R. Shaw (http://www.ershawbarrels.com/) barrel increases barrel life and makes cleaning far easier, as well as increasing the reliability of the gun. It's 1/9 twist and 5.56 chamber allow it to fire an stabilize any .223/5.56 loads, from the lightest varmint bullets to Sierra Match Kings.

    It comes with a ""F"" marked Front sight , A2 flash hider, a Magpul handguard and rail and a standard charging handle. It is a flat-top (M4 feed ramps) upper with a forward assist and deflector machined by LAR (LAR uppers are used by Remington, Spikes Tactical, and Bushmaster (http://www.largrizzly.com/web/guest/aboutus)). 

     The upper is pictured on my lower which is not included. This is a darn good upper and an good deal, at a time when these are getting hard to find (election coming and all). I am only selling this because I am reconfiguring the rifle as a mid-length. I have had 0 problems with the rifle (no feeding,extracting, etc.)

It's one of the ultimate dream guns. It has been featured toward the top of the food chain in the world of guns for 25 years. The design has been steadily refined until it's as proven a system as man can devise. It provides rapid, accurate firepower with untarnished reliability. In late 2004, the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division requested a medium/heavy rifle and cartridge combination. The .416 Barrett was designed as an improvement to the .50 BMG using NACA low supersonic drag equations to determine the shape of the projectile. The use of a lighter, narrower bullet results in a significantly higher muzzle velocity and superior ballistic performance to the .50 BMG, supposedly to such a degree that the .416 Barrett retains more energy than the .50 beyond 1000 yards. The projectile remains supersonic to out around 2000 yards. That's my typical ground squirrel shooting range. That's why I bought the Barrett."
