These boots went into my ruck and with me to Afghanistan.....and that is where they stayed.  I received two pairs of these particular boots.  These are for winter wear and we were in Afghanistan FEB thru DEC so I never used the second pair of 950s.  I do not have the box they came in and the tags have been removed.  These boots will keep your feet warm, as they have a Gortex liner, and dry due to the rubber strip that runs around the entire boot, just above the sole (see photos, dark green strip).  $75 for the pair of boots.  Shipping will be based on distance but I'd say no more than $10 to ship.  Will deliver locally if you are near Lawton, OK.

This is Bushnells Second generation Holographic gun sight. The HOLOsight delivers the fastest target acquisition. Shooting experts have tested the Bushnell HOLOsight and have given it rave reviews as one of the most innovative gunsights ever made. It uses advanced holographic technology to give you immediate target acquisition. Unlike conventional gunsights, it projects what appears to be an illuminated crosshair 50 yards in front of your gun, yet no forward light is projected. Most users experience faster target acquisition because they can sight from any distance behind the gun-without taking both eyes off of the target. This remarkable sight also offers unlimited field of view. The Bushnell HOLOsight is shockproof, waterproof and fog proof. It s half the length and weight of a conventional scope. Fits easily on handguns, shotguns and rifles with a standard Weaver style mount. -Optics: Holographic -Magnification: 1X -Reticle: Standard -Field of View 100 yards: Unlimited -Weight: 6.4 oz. -Length: 4.125 -Eye Relief: 1/2 to 10 ft. -Batteries: type N 1.5 Volt -Click Value 100 yards: .5 -Brightness Adjustment: 20 levels Features: -Instant target acquisition for faster shooting. -Unobstructed field of view for much faster target acquisition. -No parallax is very forgiving, head and gun do not have to be perfectly aligned. -Brightness intensity with 20 brightness settings, improved lower intensity allows use in the darkest hunting conditions. -No light cast on target makes it legal to hunt where red dot sights are legal. -Tool-less battery check tells user to replace battery. -Battery auto cut-off shuts off automatically after 8 hours.

These were produced in the late 1800's from flintlock muskets and reconfigured to shoot 12ga shotgun shells.  Nicknamed ""ZULU"" for some conflict in Africa in which they were imfamous for.  

This is a nice example of one of these guns.  Appears to be complete.  Action opens, hammer engages, trigger fires, etc.  This is definately not recommended for use!  Wall-hanger and conversational piece only!  These were deemed ""unsafe"" even back in the 1800's when they were produced.  A rare oddball for your collection.

Now this is not a safe queen, I've used it in competitions and out in the woods. It probably has around 3k rounds through the tube. It has been painted and the paint then removed but you can still find some on it here and there. There is also a small scratch in the barrel where it spun on me in the vise. This rifle still shoots perfect and has been maintained.

NEVER been fired. Comes with everything I got with it. Feel free to call or text, but email will get the best response throughout the day as I don't have my cell with me during the day. I consider this a sub-compact double-stack 45 as its short barrel and short grip make it amazingly easy to carry concealed. Weighing about a pound and a half empty, it's crazy light too. I will complete a bill of sale for each. I'm firm on the price and not looking for any type of trades as I need the cash!

Powder is (will be) for sale FTF in or nearby Waco. 

I have a shipment of WC844 powder coming to me. WC844 uses H335 data and is great for 223/5.56 loads, amongst others like 308. I ordered 6 kegs so that I could make some available to the shooting community. This is powder that has been professionally pulled. I am willing to sell 3 or 4 kegs. I will only sell the powder in 8lb lots.

After Hazmat and shipping, powder will come to $135/8lb FTF. 

While it would be much easier for me and my schedule if I sold all the powder to one person, I would prefer to help multiple people out. So, if anyone wants multiple kegs, price will be $150/keg.

E-mail how much you would like or whatever questions you may have. Again, only willing to sell 3 or 4 kegs max. 

I will let buyers know when the shipment will be here once I get the shipping info."

The fake silencer is made by Spikes Tactical. It is for aesthetics only, and does not reduce sound at all. It is threaded for 1/2 x 28, which should fit any threaded AR15 and many more.

The red dot has only been shot with a few times (no more than 100 rounds total). And the fake silencer has never been fired through. The sight cost me $110, the cantilever mount was $15, and the fake silencer was $50. Total value of $175, I am asking $100 for all. Comes as a complete package, so I will not separate. This would be great on any of Feinstein's ""Assault Rifles"". It would make the gun look much more ""evil"".

Description: 

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced techno-polymer. The Nano's sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hex wrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.  Made in The U.S.A.

Please read carefully: If you are a New York resident, and you want to buy this gun I will grind the threads from the barrel prior to sale so that the sale is safe act compliant. If you are an out of state resident where this rifle is legal, then I can sell it to you as is. 

This gun is about a year and a half old and has had only one box of ammo through it. It fed and functioned perfectly, for the little I used it. It is in excellent condition. It uses AR-15 magazines and comes with two ten round magazines. It does not come with the high capacity pre-ban magazines shown in the pictures. They are for sale separately, if you are an out of state resident. It includes a built in bipod that works pretty well.

If you're not familiar with this rifle, please research it. I did. This isn't a $699 direct impingement throw down from wal-mart. Ruger's msrp is 1999.00 and I doubt you'll be able to order one anytime soon. They had quit taking orders back in December when I located this one. This gun has a nice fit and finish and when compared side by side with other AR's you can see the difference. Please call if you have any questions.

*This is the Ferrari of Ar-15's.  If your going to buy an AR now why not buy one US made with the highest quality of part.  Sure you can get one for 2k from some gunshop trying to sell you some garbage they got in but this is a gun and it should be built to last so it can be handed down to your kids and then theirs.

Yes, I paid less than this but I am trying to buy a .50 and I will be paying a premium for that gun, like 12k.  I know an AR sold for 10k at the last gun show I went to 4 weeks ago.

Please dont me mad if you dont like the price.  Its all relative.  Im going to pay a higher price for mine.  Its just a sign of the times and I want to get the 50 before its too late."

Super Semi-Automatic Enhanced Trigger Overview

The Geissele Super Semi-Automatic Enhanced (SSA-E) Trigger is a finely-tuned semi-automatic-only version of our full-auto, two stage combat trigger presently used in the U.S. Special Operations Community. Built on the chassis of the Geissele SSA, the SSA-E provides enhanced trigger control and weapon accuracy while maintaining the robustness and reliability of our combat-proven two-stage trigger. The SSA-E’s reduced 1st and 2nd stage pull weights result in a trigger with a smooth, light 1st stage take-up and a crisp, candy cane-like 2nd stage break. The SSA-E is ideal for use in precision Squad Designated Marksman type rifles where weapon accuracy and reliability are critical and a non-adjustable drop in trigger is desired.


1. Performance Advantages for the Shooter
• The Geissele SSA-E has a pull weight of about 3.5 lbs. There is 2.3 lbs. on the 1st stage and 1.2 lbs. on the 2nd stage. The pull weights and sear engagement are non adjustable by the shooter.
• Trigger and hammer are made from quality tool steel.
• Sear surfaces are cut by a wire edm machine. Sears cut this way are very accurate and the non-directional surface finish of the wire edm gives a smooth trigger pull without the associated grittiness of directional machining marks left by a milling cutter.
• The initial force needed to start the disengagement of the sear surfaces is low and the force linearly increases at a low rate. This helps the shot to fall at the initial point of aim and aids in building shooter confidence in his weapons ability to put the rounds where his sight is pointing.
• The Geissele SSA-E trigger allows the shooter to slap through the trigger pull on close in shots but also set up a long range shot with a crisp trigger break.
• A full force hammer spring is used for quick locktime and positive ignition of all types of ammo. No lightened hammer spring is used.
• The hammer is lighter than a standard AR15 hammer. The lightened hammer favorably decreases locktime over a standard hammer from 8.5 to 5.1 ms and increases accuracy of the weapon.

2. Advantages for the Armorer
• The Geissele SSA-E is a simple design that is very similar to the original M16 trigger. The number of parts is identical.
• There are no adjustment screws to come loose.
• All springs are captive; they will not get lost during disassembly in the field.
• The entire trigger can be dissembled for cleaning (no rivets or staked parts).
• The trigger can be installed without removing the safety.
• Sear engagement is pre-set from the factory.

Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!
