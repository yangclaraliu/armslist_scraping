(ISM) Description
 CVA has completely redesigned the OPTIMA keeping all of the best features of the original while adding or improving many others. In fact, you’ll find features on the OPTIMA that are only found on other manufacturers’ most expensive guns. CVA’s OPTIMA includes our QRBP (Quick Release Breech Plug) – the only truly “tool-free removal” breech plug on the market today. Even after 20 or more shots, the QRBP comes out with just a twist of the fingers – try that with any other “speed breech” system.
 All OPTIMA rifles feature fluted barrels made of 416 grade stainless steel – and that’s real stainless steel, not some nickel plating or spray-on paint. Real stainless steel protects against corrosion on the outside and the inside of the barrel. The OPTIMA also has the same trigger design as our most expensive guns. This “zero center of gravity” design concept provides an incredibly light and smooth trigger pull with virtually no creep. The breech opens easily with just a touch of the breeching lever, which is located in the front of the trigger guard. The OPTIMA is available in both standard and thumbhole stock designs. Both are 100% ambidextrous, and available in either black or Realtree Hardwoods Green camo. On the standard stock model, the barrel is set up with all metal DuraSight Fiber Optic sights. The thumbhole model stock is ergonomically designed for scope shooters with DuraSight integral scope mounts included as standard equipment

Had it up a few days ago, deal didn't go through, decided not to sell to the guy because he felt the need to interrogate me after I told him I was black. Last week on a seperate deal, I drove to OKC on a trade because it was the guys first handgun so I was excited for him, wasted my gas and time only to be asked if I had shot someone with the gun I was trading him. Not cool. So in advance, I am black and from north tulsa, I work fulltime, take care of a family and I have my CC license. That alone is too much info on my part, hate to be a moron but its frustrating. This is not an OBO deal, I know guns and I know prices, I set mine for a VERY good price which is why they sell so fast. I'm only selling it cheap because I believe in being fair with people and times are hard some people can't afford to buy new reliable guns. Please don't haggle, I will tell you its sold. I know this is a side job for some to buy guns cheap then sell for more to people who don't know better. AND THOSE WHO FLAGGED MY OTHER POST ABOUT OVER PRICED USED GUNS....NOT COOL EITHER!!

Now about the gun, its in good condition. No holster wear, scratches etc, the grip/frame still has all the texture..not sure how many rounds have been fired through it but I've only fired 50 rounds through it and its been in the safe.  Muzzle rise is reduced a whole lot with the ports on top, shoots good and accurate, I just don't have use for it, I already have a G22, G23, and G27, send email if interested, comes with box, papers, 2 15 round mags.

 Chambered in 5.7x28mm, the FN Five-seveN USG utilizes a polymer frame and slide cover to create an incredibly light and easily maintained autoloading pistol.

The Five-seveN USG features a traditional style trigger guard, reversible magazine release, magazine disconnect and adjustable sights. Fixed 3-dot combat sights, either with or without self-luminous tritium elements are also available as an option. Built for extended service under the most demanding conditions, the Five-seveN's hammer-forged barrel has a hard chrome bore finish with a projected 20,000 round life. The Five-seveN USG comes standard with three 10 round magazines and a locking polymer hard case.

The overall condition I would subjectively rate at 97-98%. As you can see in the photos, nearly all of its original blue finish is still intact. There are only a couple of normal wear spots such as the end of the barrel. However there is no rusting or pitting anywhere on this beautiful example. The Grips are original with no chips or cracks, as well as the lanyard loop is still in place. The auto eject function works great and has plenty of spring tension. The bore is strong and shiny. This is one of the many that has had the cylinder shaved down in order to fire .45acp with full or half moon clips. There are one bag each of moon clips included with this sale. I have fired this gun myself with 12 rounds of .45acp in order for full function test. Photos will show all stamps and markings. This Webley is truly in exceptional condition.

 Genesis Original Kit

The Genesis, the first compound bow that automatically covers all draw lengths, is available in a convenient kit. It is the perfect introduction to the sport of archery for young and old alike.

Along with the single-cam Genesis bow, the set features several other components that will help beginners be fully prepared to take on the sport of archery. It includes a color matched durable vinyl tube quiver and arm guard with dual reinforced adjustable Velcro straps. It also features five aluminum target arrows, manufactured specifically for use with the Genesis bow. The Genesis Owner's Manual provides an easy-to-understand tutorial on how to safely use the Genesis bow and accessories. And, as an added bonus, the kit also features two free multi-colored ringed target faces.

Genesis Technology, which effectively eliminates unnecessary let-off, makes the Genesis bow an extremely versatile bow that anyone can shoot. Children can't outgrow it because there is no specific draw length. And, since the draw length is always right, it's extremely easy for beginners to shoot.

Featuring the revolutionary single-cam technology, the design breakthrough that changed the industry a decade ago, the Genesis is incredibly accurate, quiet shooting, produces very little recoil and is just plain fun to shoot.

All of which have everything that they came with new. And potentially other stuff(extra mags, mag holster, and various holsters). 
I just responded to an ad on here that was looking for this RTF2, took pics, emailed them and got into this back and forth debate on whether or not this is unfired or not... Wanted to offer 400 because he said it was ""used"" and has been fired outside of the factory testing. My OD 23 had smiles forming on the barrel within the first 50-100rds I guess? And there are no marks on this barrel, period. Anybody that wants to inspect it, feel free. I don't need to sell these, I just really want to stock one less caliber of ammo. Simple as that. So if you're interested contact me. I you think I'm gonna give them away save your time and mine. I've bought and sold guns on here plenty. I'm not looking to rip anybody off, because Karma can be a &$@*#! I don't claim to know it all, but am very familiar with Glocks.

Bushmaster’s Product Description:
One of our most popular Carbine models, the M4 Type features a distinctive Military Barrel Profile and Six Position Telestock – great for 3 Gun Match Shooting, Home Defense and Law Enforcement use.
The Bushmaster A2 & A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are modeled after our M4 Type Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individual officers (semi-automatic configuration with 16"" barrel). 

The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. 

Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling. 

The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. 

On the A2 Type - with fixed carry handle, adjustment range is from from 300 to 800 meters (1 Minute of Adjustment elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage). The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage).

Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs. 

The Bushmaster A2/A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are shipped complete with 30 round magazine, safety and operational manual, and carrying sling.

Tac-S

The Tac-S is the single stack version of Para’s best selling high capacity LDA, the Tac-Four. You get the great feel of a 1911-style pistol with a trigger that makes you a better marksman. The Tac-S gives you 7+1 rounds of potent .45 ACP firepower, solid steel construction, and the security and shootability of the LDA trigger system. Plus, the flush hammer and slim single stack configuration make for a more concealable, snag-free and easy-drawing package.

 The Advanced Armament Corp. 300 AAC BLACKOUT (300BLK) is a system that was developed to launch 30 caliber projectiles from the AR platform without a reduction in magazine capacity and compatible with the standard bolt.

Due to the high efficiency of the cartridge, less powder is used than 5.56mm, which results in a rifle that is a comfortable to shoot - even with a short barrel.

I can send more pics upon request. If it is still posted, I still have it.

Thank you, 

Will trade for: Remington 700 chambered in .308"

I just got it several months ago and I was thinking it would be fun to shoot, however with my long arms and an SKS's short length of pull makes it uncomfortable for me to shoot.

I dont know a whole lot about SKS's but Heres the details:

1) Chinese Norinco with  what looks like ""636"" in a triangle
2) It has the factory 10 round magazine in it.
3) The numbers on the bolt match the receiver
4) No rust
5) Blueing is great
6) I Recently installed a new 4x30 Illuminated NcStar scope with rings and its sighted in on paper @ 25yrds.
7) I just installed a bayonett
8) I also just got  a brand new sling in an un-opened package.
9)The 20"" barrel is chrome lined and looks excellent.
10) Ive shot Cabelas brand""Herters"" ammo and Russian ""Tula"" ammo from Wal-mart and it functioned and cycled perfectly.
11) The gun has been cleaned and is ready to shoot.

The only flaws I can see is the stock has a cross hatch carving in it (see photos) and the upperhandguard was cracked so I ordered another one to replace it and its a slightly different shade than the stock.


Selling for $325.00. After purchasing the scope & rings, bayonett and sling, im not making any money on it so the price its pretty much firm.
Not really looking for trades.

Email for additional questions or photos and phone number.

Trade offers welcomed on Taurus PT24/7 Pro. Striker Fired, 12+1 magazine capacity for .45ACP. 2 Factory magazines, original box/paperwork included. I’m willing to throw in some factory ammo to get you started if this is your first 45 as it was mine. Round count is less than 150. I want to trade, not sell, but for folks that only have cash then $350 firm with DL/short bill of sale. This is the highest quality .45 you can buy for this amount of money. Excellent gun.

The gun fires great, outclasses most .45s by both having lighter weight and higher capacity, test fires welcome. I'm just wanting to get something different.

They each come with sling, bayonet, and ammo pouch. As you can see both have their cleaning rods attached as well. If you'd like to purchase a small quantity of ammo to shoot right away I do have some I can part with so just let me know. Price is per rifle.

First one is a 1940 Tula. Numbers are matching on this one and bore is in good shape, just needs cleaned. That is the top rifle in the picture

Second is a 1942 Tula that has force matched bolt, butt plate, and floor plate. Trigger on this one is actually a little nicer than the '40 if you ask me. Again, good bore that just needs cleaned up.

I've not fired either of these but I have checked with a ""No Go"" headspace gauge and both appear to be safe to shoot. Please check with a professional if you do not feel that you are qualified to check these rifles out for operational safety. Both rifles still have cosmoline on them and the bores have not been cleaned so you'll want to clean them before taking to the range. I'd be happy to offer tips for anyone new to these. Tons of fun to shoot and probably the most affordable ""big bore"" rifle out there thanks to the availability of surplus ammo!"

I bought this gun new 3 months ago. I put about a 300 round mix of FMJs and JHPs through it. Never had a single problem.

I'm really just looking to trade for one of a few specific guns, but I would sell everything listed above for the following price:
$500 - Firm

Only looking to do a face to face transaction in the upstate area.

Trades I'm looking for:

Sig P229 - Chambered in 9mm (Will consider .40 S&W)
CZ-75 B - Chambered in 9mm (Will consider .40 S&W)
1911 - Any size, chambered in 9mm
Sig P239

I would trade for other handguns chambered in 9 x 19mm  , possibly, but I do not want anything polymer or DAO (Double Action Only). I'm also not interested in revolvers at this time.

The pictures in this post are pictures I took of the actual gun for sale/trade."

The ultimate home defense and zombie killer; the perfect substitute for those waiting for a pistol permit; extremely dependable and accurate with tight shot groups. Featured on Doomsday Preppers. 

Great for women as the recoil is very light and allows for multiple hits. For quick acquisition of targets, remove iron sights and install a BSA holographic sight with a laser and flood light ($100); with the 45 acp, when zombies, commies and home invaders go down, they stay down!"

 I do have some additional items I will sell with the gun at reduced prices or after the rifle is sold. These items are an extra magazine, Leupold bases/rings, 7mm-08 RCBS dies, Lee FCD, some empty cases, & higher end factory ammo.The factory ammo is costly to ship.

  This gun has never been fired or any bases ever mounted. These extras were from another gun. The price listed for the gun is fairly firm, plus economy shipping. The deal could be sweetened with reduced cost accessories. 

  I have great feedback on ebay, feel free to ask any questions. This gun is easy to warm up to."

The spring is still a bit stiff and needs to be worn in a bit for smoother cycling of the bolt. The bore is dark with good rifling. 
This rifle's serial number indicates that it's likely from the late 20's as it doesn't have an Iroha symbol prefixed before the serial. There is only a bayonet; no frog/sheath, dust cover, or sling. I have 10 rounds of Hornady made 6.5jap that will come with it.
