Great shooting weapon. Bought it less than six months ago, and have put less than 700 rounds through it. Basically it's barely broken in!  Will include 100+ rounds of ammo. This is NOT a .223 only AR that can't handle the 5.56 NATO round, this weapon can and will shoot both. Has the red-dot sight, with flip-up iron sights. Double stage trigger us smooth and crisp.



For those of you who don't know about the piston driven AR systems, it is a much cleaner operation. The actions in more resistant to fouling, and cleaning it couldn't be easier. I've heard people complain about the complexity of cleaning other piston system, but I've never had an issue with this one. Honestly, I shouldn't have even needed to clean it, but I'm a geek and wanted to tear it down to see how hard it was. Answer? piece of cake!

Comes with a very versatile sling too. A friend of mine who was a green beanie showed me how to use it correctly, and now that I understand it I wouldn't want any other type of sling.
Paid $1499.00+tax just a few months ago. Asking $1250.00 OBO, I am willing to negotiate, but let's not get crazy, I'm not going to give it away.

It is considered by users in elite US military and law enforcement units as the best AR-15/M-16/M4 magazine in the world. In US military testing, the HK magazine improved feeding reliability by 30-50% overall. The Maritime coating easily surpasses the US MIL-STD-810 E salt fog test. During this test the magazines were exposed to a 100 hour salt fog and then stored three days at ambient temperature. After this procedure each magazine was fully loaded and fired twice with no problems. The superior function was validated during three separate tests by the British MoD in arctic, jungle, and desert environments during the firing of more than 1/2 million rounds. *Note: This magazine has the following markings: 5.56 x 45 Restricted Law Enforcement/Government Use Only 10-94; Heckler & Kock GmbH - Made in Germancy; Heckler & Koch Inc.

It has a well executed design, special attention to production tolerances, a steel magazine housing and follower and a proprietary HK ""Maritime"" anticossosion coating. It is considered by users in elite US military and law enforcement units as the best AR-15/M-16/M4 magazine in the world. In US military testing, the HK magazine improved feeding reliability by 30-50% overall. The Maritime coating easily surpasses the US MIL-STD-810 E salt fog test. During this test the magazines were exposed to a 100 hour salt fog and then stored three days at ambient temperature. After this procedure each magazine was fully loaded and fired twice with no problems. The superior function was validated during three separate tests by the British MoD in arctic, jungle, and desert environments during the firing of more than 1/2 million rounds. *Note: This magazine has the following markings: 5.56 x 45 Restricted Law Enforcement/Government Use Only 10-94; Heckler & Kock GmbH - Made in Germancy; Heckler & Koch Inc.

A compliant, modernized, ready to go Norinco is on the block. It has a Tapco stock and Tapco Saw pistol grip. Midwest Industries quad rail with a Bushnell TRS-25 red dot up front. Tapco G2 trigger (has original trigger if you want to put it back) with a Tapco retainer plate. Three Bulgarian mags and five Tapco mags. Stock MAK 90's go for $575-$750 on Gunbroker. This is a usable, ready to go rifle that has a chrome lined barrel, good sights (all around) and can go to war at a moment's notice. I am only thinking about selling this rifle to get a high quality AR. If you have one for trade I ask that it be a flat-top, have a quad rail (or a handguard that is ready to be made into a quadrail), chromoly barrel, and chromed BCG. Outside of that, if it's decent quality, I don't care. A heavier barrel would be nice, but not necessary. Combine it with my 1911 (also listed) and get a great deal. I will sell both for $1300

Issues with the rifle, it has nicks and marks, and needs to be reblued or duracoated because of old rust from the previous owner. This is on the docket for early next year (along with new furniture from VLTOR and the like and a few extra parts from KCI and Trijicon, EoTech or Aimpoint, as well as a barrel threading) if I don't sell it. If all this happens and you happen to see my ad in 2012, I will be asking $1500 for the rifle. Honestly for about $400 more you can have an EXCEPTIONAL AK because this is already a GOOD AK."

Have shot over 1000 rounds through this set up and it is pretty accurate with the 1x scope out to 25-30 yards. (5"" group)
Put in the rifle and mount a 3x scope and you can shoot 1""groups at 25 yards. Has a 19 round tube fed magazine (full length of barrel).
feel free to make me an offer. I will include the carry case shown and a speed loader for the right offer.

Around ~ $330 in this setup. $100 rifle, $130 Bulpup stock, $50 carry case, $40 scope, $10 speed loader, $5 allen tools to take stock apart.

The Pup has a heavy trigger pull but is a very fun gun to shoot and is very comfortable with the pistalgrip and wide,  triangular, forarm grip. Holds 19 rounds in the tubular feed under the barrell and includes a 18 round X 6 tube speed loader so you can go thru ammo quick but .22 LR are cheep. I shoot the Federal bulk ammo from walmart @ .02 per round so you can shoot for hours for not much money.

I am not realmotivated to sell for a loss as I really like this setup. I will consider selling original stock separate for in person offers. Rest all goes together as I don't want to sell pieces and you will need the scope and bag any way.

White Oak Armament custom made match upper for competition. Has slick sided DPMS low-rise receiver. Comes with new complete matched bolt but no carrier. Of course the barrel is free floated with a 2.25 inch tube. Barrel is stainless and tube is blue (looks cool as all getout). Has Centra rear sights and David Tubb front sights (front sight has no inserts) . Anschutz hand stop installed. Will sell upper with sights for $1000 plus shipping. Will also trade. I have over $1200 invested in this thing
This upper will help win competitions!!!
This WOA upper has all the features needed for the HP competitor without the compromises of mass produced uppers or the steep price of a custom one. The 26"" barrel is turned from a match grade Wilson 1:8 blank, with the last 1.5"" of the barrel turned to .750"" diamter for mounting a front sight base. The precision chamber is ideally suited to across-the-course high-power competition. The fore-end is machined to accept high quality Anschutz accessories, as well as most American style hand-stops.
•Barrel twist 1:8, length 26"", 11 degree garget crown
•Headspace controlled to no more than .001 over SAAMI minimum
•Top quality components used throughout
•Barrel diameter 1"" under handguard, .825"" ahead of gas manifold, .75"" for the last 1.5""
•The modified gas system delays the unlocking of the bolt. This reduces the stress on your brass, aids in longer case life, and also helps ensure proper functioning with heavier bullets and slow burning powders"

This rifle has been to the range only once and has just 20 rounds down the barrel. It is in new condition. it has been professionally re-bedded and comes with custom Timney trigger (2.5 lb. pull) and  muzzle brake installed. Detachable magazine style.

 This gun also comes with an extra magazine, Leupold scope rings, and 3 boxes of .308 ammo. For this final week this gun will be on sale I am including a 6""-9"" Harris Bipod.

 FN Retail on this rifle is $2400 without the custom trigger, muzzle brake, rings or ammo. Price on this one is $1600. Any required FFL fees will be paid by the buyer. Local transactions preferred. 

There is an Trijicon Accupoint TR23-2G Scope (5x20x50) available with this item, but the cost would increase to 2500.00. I prefer to keep the scope, and will not sell it separately - but will sell along with the FN. I will consider a trade for an A10 of comparable value.

Details are as follows:

FN A2: McMillan A4 stock with buttpad spacers and adjustable cheekpiece, 24” barrel. Badger optics rail (20 MOA).

The FN A2 SPR features a Pre-'64 Winchester-type action with claw extractor, Controlled Round Feed (CRF) and a three-position safety. It has a 24"" chrome-lined barrel, a McMillanTM A4 adjustable tactical fiberglass stock with undercut buttstock profile, an adjustable cheekpiece and a detachable box magazine (DBM) rated at 4 rounds.

FN Special Police Rifles of all iterations are noted for being both very accurate (.5 MOA or somewhat less is not uncommon) and very low maintenance, featuring Parkerized metal finish, synthetic stocks, and a chrome lined bore in the barrel. A chrome lined bore offers a more durable, more corrosion resistant, and easier to clean barrel for the end user to maintain and is rarely found on precision bolt action sniper rifles.

It has some light handling marks on the stock that can be expected from a military surplus gun.  These guns were made as the transition gun for the spanish military before the implement of their CEMTE automatic rifles.  They share the comon Cetme barrel, and used a '48 mauser action, one of the strongest bolt action designs ever built next to the 303 british. Gun would be a great addition to a mauser collection, and a good investment. I read somewhere that less than 2000 were imported in the US in the early '80s.  More pics aval upon request"

Ruger GP100 in excellent condition that I have done what I will call some semi-custom work. May not even get rid of this as I think I have more in it than I can ever get back out of it.......but I thought I would see if there is something out there I cant live without. 

Wears a set of Williams (new style) Fiber-Optic Fire Sights. High Viz red front, Green rear (original sights included). You would swear these sights are battery operated in low light conditions, they light up really well.  Also installed a set of Altamont custom Rosewood snakeskin grip inserts, (originals included.) New Tagua leather holster. Wolf 10lb hammer spring and 8lb trigger spring installed. Not shown in pic is a new Hogue rubber monogrip that will also be included. I do not have the original box anymore.  I have right at $200 into the sights, grips and holster.

I've come to realize that I'm just not a Glock person so I've decided to sell it and get something else that suits me better.

The Glock 20SF is a semi-automatic pistol in the 10MM Auto cartridge.  The SF refers to the pistol having a Slim Frame.  This simply means the grips are a little smaller (easier to hold on to).  It doesn't affect any of the other attributes of the pistol.  Glock is known for manufacturing high-quality reliable firearms that operate in any environment.

10MM Auto is a high powered cartridge, right up there towards the top of the list as far as high-powered semi-autos.  It was developed for the FBI after a big shootout in Miami in which they discovered that their 9mm semi-autos and 6 shot revolvers weren't effective against well armed bank robbers.  Afterwards the FBI implemented a new pistol that fired the 10MM Auto.  Before long they realized that many FBI agents weren't 10-8 enough to handle such a powerful round. (Perhaps pushing pencils around a desk doesn't develop much arm strength ;-)  This eventually led to the creation of the 40S&W (40 Short and Weak) which is basically the sissy child of the 10MM Auto.  The 10MM Auto is an excellent defensive round for a variety of threats including large predators, zombies, and the occasional murderous car-jacker.

1 - Glock 20SF (G3) Pistol as I bought it brand new in December of 2009 in Box with bright Trijicon Night Sights (date is 2009) all Papers, 2 Mags, Speed Loader, Brush, and some little tool that I still haven't figured out the purpose of.

So all told I've spent about $967.00 on this kit...

I'm serious about wanting to get $750.00 out of it but I'll consider any reasonable offer.  If you're interested in buying the pistol, know this:  You will have to prove to my satisfaction that you are either a United States Citizen, or a person who is otherwise legally entitled to own a firearm in the US.  US Passport preferred.  Also, you'll have to sign a declaration stating that you have never been arrested for any crime, ever.
