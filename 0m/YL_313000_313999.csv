Hello, I’m selling my CZ P01 handgun. I bought this last year and have fired under 500 rounds through it with no failures of any kind. This gun puts other handguns to shame. This is one of the most reliable and accurate handguns available in this price range and is the ONLY NATO certified handgun available to the general public.

Features:
Alloy Frame, Steel Slide
DA/SA Operation with Decocker
Glow in the dark (not tritium) rechargeable sights
14 round magazines (9mm)
Light Rail
NATO certified (NSN number 1005-16-000-8619)

I am downsizing my collection as I just don’t ever shoot this one. This is not my first alloy frame, steel slide handgun and I have kept it well lubed with mil-comm TW25 grease on the rails and mill-comm MC2500 oil on the other moving parts (barrel, etc). The trigger continues to smooth out and will only get better with time. This handgun is all stock and un-messed with. No home gunsmithing, no bubba-making-it-fit parts.

This package comes with everything from the factory, including the P01, 2 magazines and the factory case. For an additional $40, I will include 2 more Mec-Gar magazines (if you don’t want to pay the $40, my girlfriend will gladly keep them for her CZ).

These models sell for $600, if you can find one in a local shop. Online, they sell for more than I’m asking, plus transfer fee and wait time.

I require a copy of your Drivers License and will not break any laws to get this pistol to you. A bill of sale will be written. I do not need to sell this, so please don’t try to low-ball me. This is a good price on a great gun. 
If you are prohibited from owning a firearm or are underage, don’t waste my time or yours. I will check.

75,http://www.armslist.com/posts/313075,For Sale:  Baikal IZH-46M (SOLD),"Haysville, Wichita, Kansas",$ 400,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 21, 2012",Handguns,no type,no type,Single Shot,no type,"The Baikal IZH-46M is a competition-grade, single-shot pneumatic air gun, with a hammer-forged, rifled barrel. The gun is charged with a single stroke of an underlever cocking arm.

Unlike guns intended only for plinking, several features of competition guns such as the IZH-46M mark it as designed for high-precision shooting. For instance, the IZH-46M's rear sight can be adjusted for windage/elevation, and the trigger is adjustable for position, travel, and pull. The gun can also be dry-fired without charging. The ergonomic grip features an adjustable handrest.

The Baikal IZH-46M is the current production run of the original Baikal IZH-46. The only visible and mechanical difference is the IZH-46M is built with a slightly longer (0.5"" or 12 mm +/-) air compression cylinder. As all other components except chamber length and piston stroke are the same, visually the original IZH-46 barrel appears to extend further beyond the air compression cylinder than the current IZH-46M. The extra length of the air compression cylinder allows the 46M to have a 60 ft/s (18 m/s) increase in muzzle velocity over the original 46. The IZH-46M has a muzzle velocity of approximately 470 ft/s (140 m/s).[1] In either original IZH46 or current IZH46M form, the pistol is a very consistent shooting precision 10 m airgun.

Though more expensive than many commonly available airguns, the IZH-46M is inexpensive in comparison to many similarly featured competition guns."

My dad purchased it new. It literally sat in the closet for 15+ years without ever being fired! It is in like new condition. It also comes with a scope, and the 3 magazines shown. Here is why this AR-15 is more special than just any regular AR-15:

1) This one is made by Colt is the special heavy barrel exactly like the U.S. Military issue. 
2) It is a preban, no longer made, and most are in rough condition. These are the only AR-15s I know of that you can do a full auto conversion. Don't ask me how to do this. You need to jump through several legal hoops, and I don't want to be the one responsible for giving you bad info. If you are interested in doing this, ask a gunshop with experience BEFORE contacting me.

Serious inquiries only. Please let me know if you have any other questions. 


Please note: I will not sell or meet anyone that seems to be irresponsible. I may also require at my discretion a background check to any potential buyer. So please do not contact me if you cannot pass a background check. Thanks!"

I purchased this pistol shortly after it's original release, with the intention of keeping it safely stored for the long haul.  Since new, I was conflicted with keeping it new in the box or taking the opportunity of experiencing the legendary qualities of this Belgium made work of art.  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought him back - I shot it for the first and only time 3 weeks ago. Exactly 10 shots fired down the tube.  The pistol shoots as accurate as my custom Wilson 1911, and feels better in my hand than an HK P30.  Why am I selling?  Another pistol has crossed my path that I MUST have, I'd tell you what it is but you'd probably scratch your head and think I was crazy.  Anyway, the Browning is basically new - no scratches, dings, damage, or weirdness.  

Some of the most amazing bluing I have seen on a pistol ever. 

Top of the slide is stamped ""75th Anniversary"", limited edition. 

Checkered walnut grips. 

Original hardcase, lock, 2 mags.

Was mounted on my Larue Stealth for no more than 700 rds 5.56.  I love this optic, but have upgraded a bit.  It's been a safe queen most of it's life.  Can't find the box.  ARMS throw lever mount has been on it since day one.  The pics below are stock images, my pics sucked.  Can text or email additional pics if needed.  Call 843 224919four

Called the Mark 4 CQ/T, the sight is a 1-3x14mm variable power, illuminated circle dot reticle sight. This variable power option and top-notch optical clarity is what separates the Mark 4 from the vast majority of conventional dot sights.

""The Mark 4 CQ/T was developed with considerable input from law enforcement agencies and elite military forces in a number of different countries, making it unlike any other riflescope,"" says Mike Slack from Leupold, which may help to explain the specific, functional design features.

The multifunction options built into the Mark 4 combine the strengths of the red-dot system with a variable power riflescope. At one power, it performs like a non-magnifying, illuminated sight for close ranges, allowing an officer to keep both eyes open while sighting. A bright, orange/yellow circle and dot serve as the aiming point when turned on, or the same reticle in black if not powered-up.

At two or three power, a police rifleman can engage targets at medium ranges in urban environments or open areas. The illuminated circle dot reticle is easily visible in daylight and 10 illumination settings enable user-selected contrast settings for the reticle. Two low-intensity settings are compatible with night vision equipment, and a common AA battery (field replaceable) supplies power."

Dear REDACTED,

     Thank you for your interest in my ad. Would be nice if you have some questions about my wanting to trade my Beretta that I purchased recently for a Glock 19/26 that you simply ask. I was not aware that I was required to consult you before selling/trading on ARMSLIST to make sure the trade or sale meets your approval in advance and for that I apologize. I will be sure everyone is aware that you are sending these type of messages so they may avoid the pleasure of making your acquaintance in person.

This guy has some balls...FYI I only have 2 guns...cause I work for a living and can't afford more...I guess I should feel flattered that this retard thinks I am a ""Profiteer"" or ""gun dealer"" but that is just not the case...were it not for my tax refund I couldn't have even bought the Beretta to begin with...Looks like I am going to trade for a Glock 19 Gen 4 in Maryville later today...My wife is thrilled cause she likes my Glock 23 all but the recoil...and also because after this trade we can both quit our jobs and retire :)

A protruding chrome cocking-indicator button isstrategically placed in the front inner-edge of the trigger guard, making it easy to see and feel when the weapon is cocked or un-cocked. Unloading has been made easier too, with the Mossberg EZ-Empty system. By depressing the bolt release, the carrier can be pushed up and the first shotshell in the magazine removed. Simply repeat until the magazine is empty. All 930Special Purpose models feature a drilled and tapped receiver, factory-ready for Picatinny rail, scope base or optics installation. 930 SPX models conveniently come with a factory-mounted Picatinny rail and LPA/M16-Style Ghost Ring combination sight right out of the box.

This rifle was built from the ground up for accuracy.   I have around 100 rounds through it and is in excellent condition.   
It also has a Wyatt removable box magazine and a tactical bolt handle.  It is also is fitted with a Harris Bipod and has a removable Blackhawk Tactical Sling.  All customization has been completed and is ready for you to shoot at the range.  
This rifle has consistent sub-½ inch MOA or less groups at 100 yards.  There are reviews of this rifle performing well past 1000 meters.  The rifle performs better than I can shoot it.  It currently is zeroed at 100 yards, point of aim with Federal 168 grain Sierra Match King .308.     It is a tack driver and sadly I must part with a few toys to finance other projects.   
$1100 Cash - Price is Fair and Firm.

I bought 1,000 rounds of ammo and sold half of it so the gun has had roughly 250 rounds through it with absolutely no problems. I can give an exact round count if needed, I just haven't counted how many rounds are left in the opened box of 100, it's at least half full, maybe a little more. Below is a link to the exact gun, if anyone has any questions, just ask. This gun can shoot 223 and 556 ammo. The only reason I'm selling is to fund getting another gun. Asking $700.00.

Looks like the hammer was modified for quick draw/fanning. Probably a gunfighters gun. The serial number says the gun was made in 1869.

This PLR was fired rarely, but is surprisingly accurate, and gets almost universally positive reviews from critics.  If you want a fun, simple rifle-caliber handgun, this is for you. Comes with 10 rd magazine, sling, and laser sight.

I am willing to trade for:

- A good bolt action rifle, ideally .308.  Preference for Savage 110 or Remington 700.
- $400
-I will consider an AR-15 lower receiver plus a reasonable amount of cash.

The bore is dark with good rifling.  Metal finish is worn with some minor pitting towards the muzzle but overall decent for its age.

The gun was ""sporterized"" by someone who, in some places, did a very nice job.  The bolt handle was bent, the receiver was drilled and tapped for scope mounts (included, needs a couple new screws), the stock profile was thinned, and the handguard was removed.  

I fitted a replacement handguard and retaining ring, replaced the mangled rear barrel band, replaced the front barrel band, found part of a rear sight, replaced the cut-down bolt safety, and added tall scope rings (included).

Its a good shooter but its in a caliber I don't really have a use for and its just taking up space in my gun cabinet.  The wood ought to be refinished and the bolt polished, but aside from that its not a bad looking rifle.
