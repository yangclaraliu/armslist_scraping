You'll never find one like this at this price.....This gun is one of the most sought after guns on the market.  Retail for this gun is over $650.   Will SELL (No Trades/CASH only) for the entire package for $500 FIRM.  If this gun doesn't sell today, I'll take it to the Chillicothe gun show tomorrow to sell it......"

Comes with 5 magazines, case, owners manual, brushes and factory-fired shell.

The Stoeger 8040 is a through-and-through Beretta – they used to market the pistol under the Beretta name, but moved their milling and production machinery to their Turkish Stoeger plant a few years ago to make room for the PX4 Storm production line.  The Cougar is a steel-framed pistol with a rotating-lock barrel that provides better felt-recoil reduction. It has rounded snagless features for carry.  Feels just like a Beretta M9/92 in your hand.  The .40 is harder to come by, most of what is out there is chambered in 9mm.

.308 Winchester, 7.62 x 51
24” Heavy Barrel
Serial Number Dates to 1979 Manufacture
Tang Safety
Canjar Trigger Set, 77-1
Bore and Action Excellent
The recoil lug and the first inch of barrel are bedded. This stabalizes the metal in the stock and usually assures there is no movement of the barreled action in the wood. That slight movement is usually the reason for degraded accuracy. 
Barrel is Free Floated
Includes Picatinney Scope mount and rings
Also included are Hard case, Cheek Pad, Sling and 60rds 308 ammo

The Canjar trigger set is adjustable and considered one of the best out there. Not a “production” trigger set but these were “hand made” in Denver and had 6+ months wait and $200+, when they were being made. Gentleman has since passed on and now are next to impossible to find.

Stock was a little rough when I got it so I smoothed it up, bedded and free floated the barrel. And the fit is very nice.

I intended on using it as a shooter but have a couple other things I “need” more, so I’m letting it go.

I had another one I actually shot quite a bit and I think these are definitely better built than the series II models. I have the original matching box, paperwork, wrench, lock, bag, and 7 round magazine. In the spirit of full disclosure, the gun has a very faint ""idiot scratch"" which it had when I got it and it doesn't show up in the pictures. It also has a small scratch under the slide release which is only visible when it is up. Series 1 Kimbers are hard to find, especially in this condition.

Item Description:

I have a brand new rock river 6.8 upper over a cmmg lower. The gun is completely new and never fired. All internals are rock river. Rock river IS marked on the upper receiver. It's not a ""it's a rock river upper"" and it's not even marked. No questions here. If your looking for some more punch then .223 but don't want a heavy .308. This is the ticket. Semi auto .270 bullet really rocks. It will also come with a tactical Simmons 3x9x50 scope as well as millett ar bases and rings. It has a Midwest industries quad rail and a utg aluminum front grip. Comes with four 6.8 mags and about $100 rounds of 6.8. Some hunting. Some target. Stuff isn't cheap. also come with a Blackhawk 3 point shock absorbing sling. Probably have an extra case laying around I could throw in too.

If you are looking for a basic AR-15 style rifle for $800.00, go to the store or gun show and buy one. This rifle is not for you.
We are not trying to get out of it what we paid for this rifle. We are asking less than that and not seeking to make a profit.

This rifle was built from the ground up by buying all of the most expensive parts we could find at the time. (About 2008)
The rifle has been photographed more than it has been fired. Estimating about only about 300 rounds at the indoor NRA range at the NRA Headquarters.
Heck, we don't think this rifle has ever even been exposed to sunlight.

The concept behind the whole design is to be a very rugged Close Quarters Battle rifle. 
That is why the vertical forend grip is in close so that the operator can keep his elbows tucked in tight to the body when negotiating close quarters.

The rifle was set up so that the holographic sight appears to sit directly on top of the fixed front sight. (A really cool effect.) 
This allows for the iron sights to be immediately available in the event of a battery failure of the holographic sights.
Both sets of sights have the exact point-of-aim and point-of-impact. 
This is why the height of the Picatinney rail on the forend is lower than the Picatinney rail of the flat-top upper receiver.

The Peneagonlight is bright enough to stun an opponont or cause eye damage if you look at it long enough and can be operated with the operator's thumb without relaxing the grip on the vertical forend. It gets really hot too.
Due to the compensated barrel and extra heavy buffer spring, the percieved recoil has been reduced to almost nothing.

Why are we offering this rifle for sale? We want to maintain variety in our photography and we don't have the money to go out and buy more guns. We've got enough pictures of this rifle. Time to rotate the inventory.

It was built from M16 parts when it was still legal to do that, it has an M16 barrel, bolt, fire control group, pistol grip and uses standard M16/AR15 magazines(1 included). it was built using full auto parts, the sear is now removed of course, and still has the 3 way switch that switches to full auto, though it does not engage anything. These are very hard to find, especially the one with the folding stock. the fore end is wood that was factory painted black a few scratches in the paint, no damage to the wood. this particular rifle has a strong, smooth action and fires great. the bore looks great as well as the bolt face, this has not been fired much. the grooves and lands of the rifling are strong and shiny. The rifle breaks down much like the M16/AR series of rifles. there are not any videos, that i could find, of this rifle on the internet, or instructions on how to field strip it, it is pretty simple and i will be more than happy to show anyone interested how to do everything on it. i will include a few pictures and have many detailed pictures if you want more. email me with questions and/or offers, serious inquiries only please. keep in mind this is a very rare collectable firearm. im in no hurry to get rid of it as i really like it, just looking for a new toy. Face to face transaction with missouri resident only, valid ID, no criminials, you know the drill. thank you. 

the welds that hold the stock tube onto the hinge block broke. I came up with an easy fix and it is very strong, much stronger than it ever was welded, i garuntee that. for that reason i have lowered the price, but it is still a reasonable price for a very rare collectable firearm. Ive seen these in less than decent condition go for more than what im asking. I also have a video of it being fired(link beloew) and i have never had a failure when firing this gun, it performs flawlessly and is very accurate. I will be more than happy to send any detailed pictures to serious inquiries, just tell me what you want to see.

A serial # check with Ruger revealed the following information:

Model BKH-34
Shipped September, 1972
Blued finish
Walnut grips
4 5/8"" barrel

I purchased this gun in the early 1970's from a friend who was the original owner.  He said that he had not
fired many rounds through the gun, and I fired less than 2 boxes upon purchase of the gun.  It has not been 
fired in well over 35 years. 

The appearance of the gun is close to perfect.  The only flaw I can detect is a tiny spot on one side of the tip of the barrel where the blued finish is thin.

Factory supplied 'instructions and parts list""
Black leather padded carrying case

GREAT for CCW, 9mm not only makes very cheap to go shoot at the range, but it also keeps it light. And with a 3 inch barrel, 9mm is much more manageable than 45. Deadly accurate gun.

It has a concealed internal hammer like a J-frame, but built on the larger L-frame to accomodate the 7-shot cylinder. It is amazingly light and was designed specifically for concealed carry. The 242 was only made for 2 years in the 90's and is relatively rare. This is a nice example that has been shot, but not much and has not been carried. I installed a 24/7 tritium front sight, but the original blade is still in the jewelry style case with the lock and paperwork that it came with. It will also come with 5 HKS speedloaders.
