(Yes, I know I could probably find a local shop and buy one for few hundred dollars, but about the only thing I use my iPhone is for music now.)

iPhone is in great condition. No scratches or blemishes. 

I will certainly consider other possibilities if anyone responds but I would much prefer, in decent condition, a Mosin or SKS. I don't really care if numbers match or not. Just looking for a fully functioning weapon. 

A handful of ammo would be nice as well but I'll not press my luck."

There is a bit of holster wear at the muzzle and trigger guard, not bad. Comes with three sets of grips, original S&W wood grips, hogue rubber monogrips, and hogue exotic wood monogrips.

This rifle was originally chambered in .222 but rechambered in .223. The barrel date code is CO which dates it to 1977. It was not shot very much (I don’t know the round count), but it was my Dad’s and he hardly ever shot it for the past 20 years. The bluing, chamber and bore are in great shape; there are a couple of thin scratches on the barrel that are barely noticeable. It comes with two magazines and the old Weaver V9 scope in good shape – glass is good and only has slight mounting marks and there was a small rust spot that I took a picture of. The rear mount hex screws is stripped (I was cleaning the gun a few weeks ago and when I was trying to undo it (probably for the first time in 30 years) with my hex wrench, it was in there so tight that it stripped the screw). If you really wanted to get the mount off, it wouldn’t be hard to drill out that screw, but since it is in there so tight and everything looked well oiled when I took it down to clean it, I’m not going to mess with it. Let me know if you have any questions. I am asking $475 obo. My cell is 217 eight nine eight zero one five five.

http://www.keltecweapons.com/our-guns/pistols/plr-16/

Purchased brand new a few months ago. 
Only 300 or so rounds of high quality (Federal, Hornady, Fiocchi) ammo have been fired through this gun. It has been cleaned after every firing and exhibits no issues. It has never had a FtF or FtE.

Reliable, lightweight, chambered for an inexpensive and effective cartridge, compatible with AR accessories, concealable (no buffer tube jutting out!). Provides 5.56 punch in a practical package that can be tossed in your ""bug-out bag"". Has the added bonus of being an impressive ""range toy"".  

The only bad thing I can say about this weapon is that it is loud! It is made even louder by the muzzle brake. Depending on your needs, though, this may be a pro and not a con. ;) This is a weapon that will turn heads - either toward you at the range, or away from you when the bad guy hears the first thunderclap roar out of the barrel. 

This gun is ""fully loaded"" with add-ons and accessories, including:
1x official Kel-Tec foregrip with lower rail
1x Vortex Sparc red dot sight
1x full-size AR15 birdcage flash suppressor / muzzle brake
1x Surefire 60-round mag ($130 value, fits in normal mag pouches, much better than a Beta C drum)
2x Magpul windowed 30-rd mags
1x Cammenga 30-rd mag
1x 10rd factory mag
1x assault case with mag pouches

Also including all original accessories (thread protector, lock, etc.).

Throwing in over 400 rounds of XM855 5.56 steel penetrator and ammo can! 

$1000 or best offer for the whole package. 

$550 firm for the firearm, foregrip, flash suppressor, and original accessories.

(Please no lowball offers! The PLR 16 is typically $600 new for the bare gun; are sold out locally and online; and Kel Tec is backed up so you will be waiting months on a new one. You will not find this kind of deal anywhere else.)

Will consider an AK family, FN FAL, or other quality 7.62 caliber in trade.
Will consider an AK family in any caliber in trade.
Will consider a high-end 22lr in trade (e.g., AR or SIG platform in 22lr). 
I like odd but practical firearms in inexpensive, plentiful calibers.
I will consider breaking up the package for a lower price if you already have mags, optics, etc.

Increased target recognition and identification at greater distances
Achieves extremely rapid transition from Close Quarters Battle to medium range targeting - and back again
Retro-fits to all current HWS models - providing an instant upgrade path
The unique Holographic technology allows the center dot to remain 1 moa in size, while the angular size of the target is magnified 
Zero is maintained in the HWS and not in the magnifier - you never lose zero, no matter if you are targeting through the magnifier or only through the HWS
The magnifier mount provides elevation and azimuth adjustment to allow the reticle to be centered in the FOV of the magnifier

Not a clone. I have original packaging. In very good condition. Also included is a arms quick release mount for the 512.

At this time I will not sell separate.

I will trade for a 223 or 22-250 rifle and cash."

Was attempting to get ahold of one of these .40 cals and in  my swapping I ended up with two, I’d really just like to trade it off for something else however I’ve got a cash price on the gun and 50 rounds of quality ammo of $350.00 firm.   Let me know what you have to trade, not up for  bird guns or hunting rifles, not a hunter,  only wish to trade for firearms.  It’s had 50rds through it and has everything from the factory.

I have Black, Woodland camo, Coyote brown, OD Green, Tan, Desert camo in stock.

The Universal nylon ends will fit almost any rifle. They even work good on tactical rifles like the AK, SKS or AR. The nylon will also not scratch your gun like the steel clips will. The ends are made of 1"" wide 4200lb tensile strength nylon. You could pull a truck with this stuff. I use the nylon instead of leather for the added strength and will not get brittle like leather over time. The nylon is held together with a black 1/4"" chicago screw. The black finish on the screws are highly scratch resistant, seems to be a black chrome finish. Made of new USA made Mil spec government approved 550 7 strand Paracord. There is a total of about 90 feet of paracord in this sling. In an emergency you can unravel the outer 45 feet of cord and still have a useful black sling. 

The USA made paracord is manufactured to Mil-C-5040H Type III standards. This paracord has seven removable inner strands. Each of the 7 strands of 100% nylon strands are made from two-ply yarns. This is certainly not the lower quality paracord that is made from bulk fibers. Each of these 7 strands are capable of holding 50 pounds. The outer cord is made from 32 strands which are braided together and can hold 200 pounds. Add it up (50x7 + 200) and the cord can hold 550 lbs, therefore it is truly 550 paracord. 

Paracord is like duck tape and has unlimited uses only limited by your imagination. The 7 inner strands can also be removed and used for things like fishing line, or sewing thread.

I usually sell them for $50, but they are now just $25.00. Shipping is only $3.00 per order. I also take Pay-pal or can meet in Louisville or Shelbyville.

This pistol is beautiful and has just been sitting in my safe. It features a deep blue finish, double checkered rosewood grips, 3-dot sights, lowered and flared ejection port, and a flat mainspring housing. It is a series 80 firing system for those of you who worry about such things. It has the nice rollmarks that say COLT Government model on one side and NO rollmarks on the other(which is nice, just like the originals without a lot of writing). This pistol is one that you can hand down to the grandkiddies. As they say if it ain't a Colt it ain't.......

It comes with the box, manual, warranty, and 2 7 round Colt magazines.
I recently purchased a arched mainspring housing from Colt that would give it a little more of a 1911A1 look. I will add that for an additional $20($35 dollar part from Midway USA).

FTF in Colorado Springs preferred but will drive a reasonable distance. Must be legal to own a handgun in CO. Not interested in trades at this time, need the greenbacks. Contact me with any questions. I can send additional pics via email to serious buyers. Thanks for looking!"

""Covert frames are coated in Desert Tan KimPro II™ a premium finish that is durable, self-lubricating and extremely resistant to the elements. Black matte slide and small parts give each pistol a dynamic appearance. 
Covert pistols are made in the Kimber Custom Shop, where they are fit and finished by hand. Crimson Trace Lasergrips in digital camouflage pattern with Kimber logo offer critical tactical and training advantages."" 


During cleaning, the Hoppes solution ""cleaned off"" the digital camo paint on the top of the right side grip   --  who'd a thought it?  It doesn't look like this gun was ever carried in a holster.

This is a used gun; It's not in perfect 'like new' condition, but it's close.  The night sights glow and the laser is bright.  The trigger pull is clean and crisp.  It is the best shooter in my collection.

the bottom box is a 14 long gun safe / cabniet.  it has one keyed lock that activates 3 locking points.  the interior of the safe is padded with foam.  and yes this means the floor and the walls.  the foam shows no discoloration from oiled barrels as all the long guns have been kept in gun socks.  on the interior of the door is a storage / orginazation pouch.  it has upto 4 pockets and straps that wil hold anything with a belt clip on it.  the bottom box measures 16 inches deep by 21 inches wide by 55 inches tall.  on the interior of this box there is a top shelf that can be removed.  it is n ot a full shelf so if you have very long guns you can slip the barrel behind it.  this unit is factory drilled to be mounted to eithr the floor or a wall.  mounting hardware will come with the box.  

together both boxes measure 70 inches in hight.  they show no scratches, dents or marks of any kind.  i have 2 keys for each box and the long gun boxes original paperwork.  about 9 months ago i bought the bottom box for $279 and the top box for another $70 and the interior pocket pouch for $20.  total of $369.  again i am asking just $200!

there are a lot of extras that can be bougght for these types of safe / cabniets from stack on.  so you can customize them to fit your situtation best.

Unless it's a .45 Ill take $350 cash or if you have a better offer.

I would much rather have someone own one of these and appreciate it for what it's worth than have it sit in a gun case. These are collection guns, the value on them goes nothing but up every year. I don't want to get rid of it but I need something for a concealed carry and another for my wife. Any questions please ask, don't be afraid to make an offer, I won't be mean, but please don't low ball, if you don't get a response it means you've low balled me. The worst I can say is no. Thanks!"
