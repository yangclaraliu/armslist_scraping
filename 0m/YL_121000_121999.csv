Here is a good review by Combat Handguns: http://www.para-usa.com/new/downloads/reviews/CH09-07.pdf
Depending on the deal, I will include a London Bridge Trading Load Bearing Chest Rig & Drop Leg Holster which combined retail for over $400. One pouch has slots cut for a radio antenna, but it is all in excellent condition. My main interest is an AR, preferably 20""+ barrel and flat top as it will be used for hunting. Also open to other handguns and rifles.

Ohio transactions only, I will not ship out of state. I am in Canton Ohio, and will drive a bit for a FTF transaction. Thanks!"

These have not been shot in many years. In general, they could all use a cleaning and some oil. Some of the actions are not as smooth as they could be, but I think a cleaning would solve that.

12ga pump
2 ¾” chamber
Unknown choke
Stock in great shape.  See the shot of the wood behind the trigger guard.  I don’t think it’s cracked, but you can be the judge.  Bluing is mostly gone.  Some minor pitting.  Same as the Stevens 520 I think.
Contact me for more pictures.

This is the first semi auto 22 Winchester had produced, followed by the Remington model 16. This rifle Shoots as good as it looks. It has been refinished. All parts are original. The bore is like new also, which is very hard to find in this model rifle, due to the use of black powder and corrosive primers. This rifle must have been very well taken care of, or had little use. Made in 1908, It is all very snug and action is crisp. Shoots only Win 22 Auto ammo. WILL NOT shoot conventional 22 ammunition. Blue Book value for this rifle in this condition is $1325.00 I am asking only $375.00 for quicker sale. Due to having an obsolete caliber, this rifle is considered an antique, requiring NO FFL.

ADDED STOCK PHOTO W/ SIMILAR GRIPS.  I have original crossed cannon grips as well as better quality VX G-10 grips with blackened screws.

This is the nicest pistol I've ever owned. Trigger breaks like glass and it is a tackdriver. Hate to put it up for sale, but it is too big for me to CCW comfortably and it isn't getting shot at the range. Since I bought this nearly 2 years ago I fired it at the range once, cleaned it, and put it in the safe. Every now and then I took it out to fondle but that's about it. Was carrying a Star BM instead but decided that was too heavy for me as well. I've decided to move away from this caliber altogether.

I have a lightly used Springfield Armory Stainless Loaded 9mm with adjustable sights & ambi safety in the original blue plastic case with papers and all the stuff that came with it, including a Kydex holster and dual mag carrier. Info on this piece is at their website here: http://www.springfield-armory.com/armory.php?version=22

Pistol's prior owner had a great gunsmith lighten the trigger to 2.5#. It is the best trigger job I've ever seen, although it is may be too light for the average shooter.  Breaks like a glass rod.  Perfect trigger.  He stated he only put a few hundred rounds through it before deciding he wanted a .45 instead. I put less than 50 rds through it myself. There are a few minor scuffs on the stainless finish that were there when I bought it -- looks like from the original owner drawing it from the Kydex. I have the original grips but replaced them with VZ Double Diamond in black G-10 which looks nicer and feels great. http://vzgrips.com/gun-grips/1911-pistol-grips-1/double-diamonds-1/double-diamond-black-g10 Aside from that, the only change I made to this piece was to touch up the sights with a bit of nail polish (white on the back, red on the front) which I think is an improvement, but if you don't like it or want to redo it, it is very easily removed with a bit of acetone on a swab.

In addition to the aforementioned Kydex holster (RH), I have several other holsters that I could include, first two I'll throw in for free, willing to work out a deal on the other two. One is a cheapo ambi belt slide that I got for free and never used, the others are really nice. First one is a Galco IWB tuckable w/J-hook (LH). Next is an impossible to find Israeli Front Line IWB with teflon lining (LH). Last is a Galco Miami Classic shoulder rig in like new condition. This is set up for LH, but you can make it RH simply by switching it around, but if you want to get a proper RH holster for a clean draw Optics Planet has one you can add on for about $40 (this is a modular system).  The Front Line And Miami Classic cost me over $200 total and both are LH, and if you want either I will give you a good deal but I will not give them away for free.

I have a total of 7 top quality magazines for this pistol. This takes 9rd mags but one is a Wilson 10rd.

I have well over a grand in this package.

I have reduced my cash price for the gun, 7 mags, 3 holsters, and assorted extras to $775.  It is worth considerably more.  Extra mags go for about $30 each.

Would do an even exchange for an EMP (I can always hope).

For partial trades, I like .25 automatics, and especially like the Beretta Jetfire. Might consider .380 but I'm picky. I like the SIG P230 and the chrome slide LCP.  I would consider a long barreled .38 or a short barreled lightweight 1911 with ambi safety.  No more long guns -- I haven't got any room for them.

I am in no hurry to sell. I will likely regret selling this. But it is impractical for me because my eyes aren't good enough to target shoot and it is too big for me to carry. Someone wants this. Open to reasonable offers but please do not insult me with ridiculous lowballs.

WILL NOT SHIP

NO, YOU CANNOT DISASSEMBLE PISTOL TO ""LOOK AT"" IT.

NO BAD GUYS

They are really cool! Detachable magazine, high powered military round, well designed muzzle brake to eliminate recoil, and a blow forward brass deflector that doubles as the charging handle. The only thing I don't like about this rifle is it is big and heavy.

Well, I swapped my spare for a Mauser + cash a couple months back and am considering letting my primary go as well. Still haven't had a chance to fire it. Bore is nice. This was very well taken care of.

In addition to the standard 10 rd mag, I also have a couple of hi-caps: a 20 rd Federal and a 25 rd ribbed MG-13 mag that was adapted to fit by a Hakim expert (cost nearly a hundred bucks on gunbroker, but it is a good one). Comes with a sling, gas tool, manual, tech sheet, and I can add some ammo as well. Does NOT come with bayonet in pic.

Pics of this fine rifle can be seen in the original sale thread below. Extra hi-cap mag (better quality than the Federal) not in pic.

http://www.armslist.com/posts/84364/denver-colorado-rifles-for-sale-spf-hakim-8mm-bayonet-high-cap-mag-ammo--more

I have mixed feelings about parting with this rifle. I love this thing, even if it is a bit heavy and awkward. This is far more badassed than an AR or an AK. Surplus ammo is cheap and you can get various fire hazard colored tip ammo for it at Tanner. Only thing you don't want to shoot through it is Turkish as it is loaded too hot. Yugo, FN, German all run fine. Gas can be adjusted depending on ammo used.

I'm listing this at $600 CASH right now.

Trades? I want an alloy framed SIG P230. I like long barreled .38 special revolvers and nickle plated .25 automatics. I'd really like an INOX Jetfire. Would consider a chrome slide LCP. Can always use quality .380 and .25 ACP ammo.

I don't need or want custom & can buy them all day long for under $450.

I also have a CCU conversion bug & would like to buy an old 1st gen G17 complete or frame only.  Max I'd pay for this is $300 for working complete gun, or $100 or so for a frame with striker fire & trigger assembly.  I'd prefer to buy just the frame, as the rest of the gun would just get stored in a box.

The reason NONE of the extras are in the picture is currently  “WE” are in the process of moving to ""Montana"" and everything is packed.  If purchased ""ALL"" accessories WILL be unpacked and placed with the Rifle.

This rare low mile 1997 model motorcycle has approx 30,800 miles and a clean title (can provide title report). Bike is ridden on a regular basis, runs perfectly and has been meticulously maintained. The paint is nearly flawless, with the exception of some very minor riding related scratches (shoes, zippers, etc.). Once upon a time it had a low speed low-side that resulted in scratches on the lower fairing and engine case cover which have been replaced with genuine Honda parts. It's currently in immaculate condition and ready to ride anywhere.

The 'Suomi KP/-31' (Suomi-konepistooli or ""Submachine-gun Finland"") was a submachine gun (SMG) of Finnish design that was in service during World War II. It was a descendant of the M-22 prototype and the KP/-26 production model, which was revealed to the public in 1925. The Suomi-konepistooli KP/-31 is often abbreviated to Suomi KP.

The Suomi KP/-31 is regarded by many as one of the most successful submachine guns of World War II and it was so successful that many of its features (including the soon developed 71-round drum magazine) were later copied and adopted by the Soviets for their PPD-40 and PPSh-41 submachine guns.[3] The accuracy compared to the mass-produced PPSh-41 was superior however, thanks in part to a noticeably longer barrel, with the same rate of fire and the equally large magazine capacity. The major disadvantage of the Suomi-KP was its high production costs.

The Suomi KP/-31 also incorporated a few new design features, including an arrangement whereby the spring was mounted inside the bolt in order to make the gun shorter. Its 50-round quad-column ""Casket"" box magazine was more reliable than the early 50-round ""bullets loaded nose down"" drum magazine, and similar applications were used on the Argentine C-4 submachine gun and present-day 60-round 5.45x39mm AK-74 compatible magazines.

The M-22 and KP/-26 were made by Konepistooli Oy, founded by Master Armorer Aimo Lahti, Captain V. Korpela, Lieutenant Y. Koskinen and Lieutenant L. Boyer-Spoof. The Suomi KP/-31 was designed by Koskinen and Lahti.

The Suomi KP/-31 went into serial production in 1931 by Tikkakoski Oy and most of these weapons were bought by the Finnish Defence Forces. The Finnish Defence Forces were equipped with about 4000 Suomi KP/-31 submachine guns when the Winter War started. During the course of the war, the design was altered with the addition of a muzzle brake, which increased the submachine gun's overall length by 55 mm. The revised version was designated KP/-31 SJR (suujarru, or ""muzzle brake""). Aimo Lahti was displeased with this revision, believing that it reduced the weapon's reliability. Ultimately, roughly half of the KP/-31s in Finnish service were of the SJR version. Initially the KP/-31 was issued as a substitute for a light machine gun, and proved inadequate in this role. Instead, soldiers learned by trial and error how to use submachine guns to the best effect. By the time of the Continuation War, Finnish doctrine had been altered to include both a KP/-31 and a light machine gun (usually a captured Degtyaryov DP) in every infantry squad, and by 1943 this had been expanded to two KP/-31s per squad. KP/-31 production continued with the intention of adding a third submachine gun to each squad, but this plan was shelved in 1944 when the Continuation War ended.

A specialized bunker version was also produced in very small numbers (a total of 500 built) in 1941, with a thinner barrel shroud to allow firing through the narrow ports of defensive bunkers. This version lacked a shoulder stock and was equipped with a pistol grip. An even rarer version was produced for use as a secondary gun in the firing ports of Vickers Alt B Type E 6-Ton tanks, but only a few dozen were built before production was canceled due to the outbreak of the Winter War. Production never resumed, as captured Degtyaryov DP machine guns proved far superior in this role. Like the bunker version, the tank version had a pistol grip and no buttstock, and it could be quickly removed from the tank and fitted with a standard barrel shroud for infantry use if needed. The tank version remained in the Finnish Army's inventory through the 1980s, despite the tank it was designed for being retired in 1959, possibly because the Army forgot that they existed.

The Suomi KP was also manufactured under license in Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland, where it was known as the Hispano-Suiza MP43/44. Tank and pillbox variants were also developed and produced in Finland.

In 2009, a semi-automatic version of the Suomi KP was produced for civilian sale in the United States[citation needed], replacing the receiver and lengthening barrel to meet the standards of the National Firearms Act.

The Suomi KP was also manufactured under license in Sweden, Denmark, and Switzerland, where it was known as the Hispano-Suiza MP43/44. Tank and pillbox variants were also developed and produced in Finland.

In 2009, a semi-automatic version of the Suomi KP was produced for civilian sale in the United States[citation needed], replacing the receiver and lengthening barrel to meet the standards of the National Firearms Act. I HAVE ONE OF THESE... VERY RARE.. INCLUDES 4 EA 71 ROUND DRUM MAGAZINES... AND STRAP.. 9 MM AMMO AVAILABLE AT A PRICE. THX."

It has had custom work done on it. The feed ramp was polished and the ""lip"" from the feed ramp to the barrel was lowered and smoothed. This is all to help feeding and prevent malfunctions.

Very few were imported and many of the ones available are not in good shape.  This is one of the nicer ones I've seen.  Bore is clean, overall condition is Excellent.  This rifle was very well taken care of by the prior owner.  Functions flawlessly according to prior owner, and it feeds and extracts snap caps well.

Detachable magazine, high powered military round, well designed muzzle brake to eliminate recoil, and a blow forward brass deflector that doubles as the charging handle.  Very unique design.

In addition to the standard 10 rd mag, I also have a couple of hi-caps: a 20 rd Federal and a 25 rd ribbed MG-13 mag that was adapted to fit by a Hakim expert (cost nearly a hundred bucks on gunbroker, but it is a good one). Comes with a sling, gas tool, tech sheet, a good book about this rifle, and I can add a few hundred rounds of good quality ammo as well (most of it is non-corrosive, no bulk garbage here). Does NOT come with bayonet in pic.

Pic from original sale thread below. Extra hi-cap mag (of much better quality) not in pic.

I have mixed feelings about parting with this rifle. I love this thing, even if it is a bit heavy and awkward. This is far more badassed than an AR or an AK. Surplus ammo is cheap and you can get various fire hazard colored tip ammo for it at Tanner. Only thing you don't want to shoot through it is Turkish as it is loaded too hot. Yugo, FN, German all run fine. Gas can be adjusted depending on ammo used.

I'm listing this at $575 CASH right now.

Prefer cash to trades at this time.  I am including a LOT of top quality ammo with this in hope of a quick sale.  I still need to count it, but it is at least 300 rds of the good stuff (no cheap crap).  With the hi-caps, book, and ammo it is worth several hundred more than my asking price, but I know I'm not going to get top dollar for MilSurp in this economy.

This is CASH price.  If you want to make an offer, please be reasonable and willing to negotiate.  If you want to offer a trade, please be fair.  No, you cannot disassemble the rifle before lowballing me.  No lookie-loos.  This is a nice, solid, reliable autoloading rifle in 8mm Mauser.  It is worth significantly more than my asking price.

No bad guys or loonies.  Thanks."

Description from Benelli:

Back when everyone thought that the pump action shotgun couldn't be improved, the Benelli Nova Pump proved otherwise. Completely original and innovative, the 20-gauge or 12-gauge pump incorporates a polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics make the gun not only pleasing to look at, but a delight to hold and handle. Distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and forend in place of conventional checkering provides a positive gripping surface and complements the innovative engineering of the Nova Pump. With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova 12-gauge shotgun and 20-gauge shotgun handle anything from target loads to 3-1/2"" magnums. Available in Black Synthetic, Realtree MAX-4® and new Realtree APG® finishes, and as a youth model, the Benelli Nova Pump is the most versatile pump action shotgun ever made."

It comes with three 12 round mags and an IWB adjustable depth kydex and leather holster. Have the box as well. I have, as the guy who made the holster for me, a ""goofy"" draw. It's made for being at the 6 o'clock so it's backwards I suppose. The gun itself has some holster wear, but I'd rate it at 90%. Round count is around 450. It's been completely reliable for me. No stove pipes, jams or double feeds. Bought it new last December and just want something else. I'd take 300 cash or something in a .357 or .38 special revolver or maybe a rifle, cash up is also an option.

I have decided to get rid of all my 8mm Mauser stuff.

THIS IS BEING SOLD AS A LOT, DEEPLY DISCOUNTED AT HALF PRICE, DO NOT ASK ME TO PART THIS LOT OUT AT THE DISCOUNTED PRICE.

I originally had my Hakim rifle posted.  Just looked it over and needed to make a correction.  Hi-caps are 25 rd and 30 rd.  10 rd also included.  Compatible with stripper clips.  Hi-cap mags go for between $75 and $100 each when you can find them.

I am adding a beautiful Turkish Mauser to the lot.  This is the nicest one I've ever seen and is valued at about 200.  I have a bullet band for the stock and a shell loop sling, both brand new and in original packaging.  Have a new Garand sling for the Hakim as well.  I have a broken shell extractor tool, also brand new in package.

I am including ALL my 8mm Mauser ammo, including some incredibly rare and expensive collectable ammo.  I have a full box of Italian green tip AP, a full box of German WP that was pulled and reloaded by Yugo military, 20 rds of blue tip from Denver Bullets, and a full box of (new) Hi-Shok soft point hunting ammo as well as approximately 400 additional rounds of FMJ, most of which is non-corrosive.  Only a single small box of crap 50s Yugo.  The AP and WP rounds alone are valued at over $100.  This is the real stuff, not repainted tips.  I'm guessing about $350 worth of ammo here, maybe more.

I already told you about the Hakim.  Rifle alone, without the extra mags, is worth about $500.  I'm going to cut and paste the data from the original ad below:

This is a Hakim battle rifle chambered for 8mm Mauser. Very few were imported and many of the ones available are not in good shape. This is one of the nicer ones I've seen. Bore is clean, overall condition is Excellent. This rifle was very well taken care of by the prior owner. Functions flawlessly according to prior owner, and it feeds and extracts snap caps well.

Detachable magazine, high powered military round, well designed muzzle brake to eliminate recoil, and a blow forward brass deflector that doubles as the charging handle. Very unique design.

In addition to the standard 10 rd mag, I also have a couple of hi-caps: a 20 rd Federal and a 25 rd ribbed MG-13 mag that was adapted to fit by a Hakim expert (cost nearly a hundred bucks on gunbroker, but it is a good one). Comes with a sling, gas tool, tech sheet, a good book about this rifle, and I can add a few hundred rounds of good quality ammo as well (most of it is non-corrosive, no bulk garbage here). Does NOT come with bayonet in pic.

Pic from original sale thread below. Extra hi-cap mag (of much better quality) not in pic.

Surplus ammo is cheap.  Only thing you don't want to shoot through it is Turkish as it is loaded too hot. Yugo, FN, German all run fine. Gas can be adjusted depending on ammo used.

Let's see . . . $500 Hakim, $200 Mauser, $200 worth of hi-cap mags, $350 worth of ammo, easily another $50+ in assorted extras.  Holy crap, I invested well over $1200 in this caliber.

FOR EVERYTHING IN THE LOT

I am asking $725 obo.

That is a really good deal.  Selectively open to trades, but that is a CASH price, not a trade value price.  Make your offer a fair one.  Thanks."

Got two of em, and really only need one. $750.00 cash or trade for a full sized QUALITY 1911( no Taurus 1911's... already have one), or maybe an M-4 type AR-15.

P-3AT (Custom Billfold Brown Color)
The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety."

There is no surface rust or pitting, just some slight file marks on the charging port. Looks clean inside and out, little to no wear!

Very clean & as close to new as you can get Sig Sauer p226e2.  It's now called the ""Enhanced Elite"".  This pistol was made in Sept. of 2010.  It's had about 200 rounds fired through it.  It is a beautiful pistol, & deadly accurate.  It has a factory short trigger, a factory short reset trigger, factory Sig tritium night sights, & the newest ergonomic grip design with a smaller circumference & a reduced trigger reach for DA mode.  It includes all the books, the box, lock, take down/cleaning tool, both 15 round factory mags, an aftermarket MecGar 18 round mag (MecGar makes all the factory mags for Sig, Browning, Beretta, etc. They are a much higher quality than promags), a Gould & Goodrich leather paddle holster w/ a covered trigger guard & a leather belt slide holster.  I really like this gun, but I don't want to ding it up dragging it back & forth to the range & would prefer to own a couple of Glocks as one Sig. 

That being said, $1000 cash.  The only trade that would interest me would be a Glock 17 or 26 PLUS substantial cash, or I would trade even for BOTH a 17 & 26 model Glock that was a gen3 & in as good a condition as my Sig.

It's like new in the box and looks outstanding!!!  It has the color case hardened receiver with blue Finished 4 5/8"" Barrel.  The colors on the frame are very cool looking and I don't think Ruger does that anymore. Ruger sent this gun out in 4/97.  

The cool thing about this gun is that it is the old style Vaquero. That means if you reload 45 colt you can make this as powerful as a 44 mag. Hogdon has online reloading data for the old Vaquero. You cannot use the hot loads in the new Vaquero. 

The Ruger Vaquero has become one of the most popular, reliable, and accurate single action revolvers ever built: Originally designed with Cowboy Action Shooters (CAS) in mind, the Vaquero has developed a large following with hunters, shooters, and outdoorsmen who want a rugged, reliable six-gun to keep on the hip.
MUST SEE!

EXTRAS:
This gun comes with a brand new custom fit holster made by Gaunt Leatherworks here in Springfield.  I also have a new 2” heavy leather belt also made by Gaunt Leather to add to the deal (Size 38-40).  Up to size 44"" 
Paid $65 for Holster and $60 for Belt.

Now for the rest of you listen up. 


The Saiga 12 is a magazine loaded 12 gauge shotgun that is capable of inflicting severe damage, so much so that the BATF has banned their import temporarily and will release their permanent ban on May 1 st . I believe that these will be found by the BATF as “destructive devices” and if so will require a $200 tax stamp to purchase one IF (huge if) one can be found. These are similar to the USAs-12 which were available to the public briefly then banned by the ATF. There are no more of these coming into the country, give Arsenal a call and find out for yourself. You can’t find these at gun shows because they are gone. This is your only warning: Buy now and save $$$ or pay through the nose later IF you can find one. 


Note on converting these to accept AK-47 furniture. This is a simple process a trained monkey or child could do in less than 2 hours, don’t waste your time paying someone an outrageous amount of money. Watch the videos on www.youtube.com   and it’s a snap. All you need is a dremil tool and/or die grinder, drill, drill bits, flat head screw driver and a pair of needle nose pliers. 



FOR SALE: Saiga 12. Unmodified, brand new in the box straight from Arsenal. These are the 109 version which have the bolt-hold open function, these come with (1) 5 round mag, cleaning kit and paper work. As a bonus I am going to include a $30 Tapco G2 trigger group, you will need this if you want to convert your Saiga. 


I am considering reasonable cash offers and trades, these sell on gunbroker all day long for $900 so dreamers will be ignored.

I prefer face to face with Florida ID, will ship to FFL for additional fee.

Hard chromed and ready to go, factory box and papers included, (1) .50 & (1) .44 mag.

I believe the caliber this rifle to .25 rimfire. The rifle is marked with the number 22 under the forearm. It appears to have a case hardened frame with what would have originally been a blued barrel… oil finished walnut straight grip stock and forearm. The wood exhibits no visible splits or cracks, but does have a very small piece missing from the right side of the butt stock above the lever action. Fixed front sight, buckhorn rear sight and vernier tang sight. This is a numbers matching rifle of which the serial number is 2788. Overall, this firearm appears to be complete and in very good condition with a tight action and good bore. This firearm is being sold as a collector piece only. Ammunition for this caliber is extremely rare and probably costly.

The Z2 LED is a compact high-output flashlight featuring a CombatGrip body. It uses a virtually indestructible power-regulated LED and a precision micro-textured reflector to produce a smooth 120-lumen beam—six times the light of a big two-D-cell flashlight, and more than enough to temporarily blind and disorient an aggressor by impairing his night-adapted vision. The tactically-correct pushbutton tailcap switch provides secure, ergonomic activation control: press for momentary-on, twist for constant-on. The Z2 LED's patented CombatGrip body improves performance with various flashlight/handgun techniques, such as the Rogers/SureFire technique, and provides a secure hold in wet or cold conditions or while wearing gloves.

Not much into knives. Looking for AR parts, Semi auto pistols. No 22's or 25's. What do you have?"
