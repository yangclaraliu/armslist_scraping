First is an Hakim rifle in 8mm. This is basically a Swedish Ljungman rifle made for egypt. It is magazine fed, semi-auto, uses a direct impingement system similar to AR's, and has an excellent muzzle break to help with recoil. Very accurate with irons.

Second is an FR-8 in .308:
These are Spanish made bolt action carbines constructed from 8mm Mauser actions for .308. They were a stop gap measure before the CETME could be introduced. They are very short, and make excellent brush guns. Has a NATO flash hider and a fake gas tube up front to store a cleaning kit.
I've put 20 rounds through it since I've had it and it seems to be very accurate with open sights for within 100 yards. I haven't tried the adjustable peep sights which range out farther.

I have a little over 100 rounds of 8mm to go with the Hakim and a 3 boxes of ammo to go with the FR-8.

I's like to see these gone; they're taking up too much room in my cabinet, and I have no use for either one. I'm going for a trade value of $700. The Hakim's generally go for about 500 and the FR-8's for about 350 or more.
Would take cash for both or partial or whole trades. Ammo as well.

I think the smallest 9mm on the market.  About the size of many compact 380's, but with 9mm power.   This gun has been to the range twice. With maybe 100 rounds downrange.  It's not working out very well for me, with my small arthritic hands, but I watched 2 Range Officers put four magazines down range without a hickup.
I think this gun needs a large hand with a stong firm grip for it to be reliable.
I'm not able to get it to function reliably with my small arthritic hands so I'd like to sell it to someone younger with stronger hands.   It's small size makes it  a perfect pocket pistol, I would recommend a holster to cover the trigger, since it's DAO with no safety.   I have a Galco front pocket holster that fits it perfectly, I'll thow in for another 15 dollars.    You can read all about the DB9 at Diamondbackfirearms.com.  It really is a cool little gun and I wish it worked out for me better.   Don't be fooled by less expensive prices on the Internet, they are without the comensated barrel, (a $119 addition) and you have shipping and FFl charges in addition to the price."

The just-released Mossberg Model 500 50th Anniversary Edition is an upscale version of the popular Model 500 slide-action shotgun. The basic specifications are as follows:

Mossberg 500-50th Anniversary
MSRP: $440.00
Mossberg Part #50123
6 Shot Capacity
12 Gauge, 3"" chamber
28"" VR Ported Twin Bead Barrel
Accu-Set Choke Set (3)
47-1/2"" OAL, 13-7/8"" LOP
Checkered Stock High Gloss Walnut
Laser Cut Anniversary Logo
7-1/2 lbs. (7-1/4 lbs. as tested)

Over 9.5 million units later (and closing in on 10 million), this 12 gauge pump offering is collectable. A nod is given to the 1961 Mossberg 500 with the Red Recoil Pad; the Jeweled Bolt and Carrier is nice upscale touch. The Walnut has a Glossy Finish and Nice Figure. It is a functional, utilitarian slide action weighing seven and a quarter pounds with an approximately six and a quarter trigger out of the box.

It is also an exceedingly good value, with a full boat retail of only $440, it is a do-anything type of gun that is still easier on the eye than many similarly priced offerings. You have a Polished Blue Receiver & Barrel on this Model 500 as opposed to the essentially unfinished, matte fodder populating so many shotguns today, a Gold Trigger, a Center Bead, and a Ported Barrel. Also, Mossberg provides Three Screw in Choke Tubes as opposed to some others that shaft you by including only one. Mossberg 500 receivers are drilled and tapped for optical sight mounting, and this model is no exception to that. Mossberg also provides a Ten Year Limited Warranty which is far more generous than most.

For just a few dollars more, the Model 500 50th Anniversary nets you a better-looking example of what has long been the best value in a quite functional, eminently usable, American-made repeating shotgun. It is hard not to appreciate all of this.

A Great Christmas Present to Your Self, Your Son or Daughter.

The Omega's unique action operates by using the forward motion of the
trigger guard lever to pivot the breech block downward, allowing access to
the primer pocket. It's closed breech protects the primer from adverse
weather. Additionally, the breech design prevents crushing Pyrodex pellets.
The guard lever swings the breech block downward, allowing easy access to
the 209 primer pocket. Once primed, the lever is pulled rearward, raising
the breech block and sealing the breech. This closed breech design protects
the 209 primer from rain, snow or sleet.

Up for sale are a few firearms that I never use or use very seldom. The majority of these guns were purchased new by me and the majority of them have never been fired. I simply bought them and put them in the safe. I posted these before and had a sudden change of heart and decided not to sell them. However, my wife and I have found some property that we would like to purchase. So I am listing these for sale again. I Multiple guns trades are ok. Below is a list of all of the guns that I am offering for sale or trade.  I also have a very extensive and valuable collection of autographs for sale. This is my personal collection and I have put this collection together over the years. This is an amazing collection for any baseball fan. The total autograph collection is valued at over $20,000. I also have these items listed below. All of the autographs have proper documentation and certificates of authenticity. I prefer cash but I will consider trades on these items as well. My asking price for the entire collection is $4,000. This would make an excellent investment opportunity for someone. This autograph collection is worth much more. You could easily triple your money if you had the time to sell the items individually. I just don't have the time. These must go as soon as possible. No reasonable offers will be refused on the autograph collection. These must go as soon as possible. Send me your best offer. I must sell these items rather quickly because I do not want the property that we are planning on purchasing to be sold. We really need the money for a larger down payment. I will consider trades and cash offers, but please be reasonable. The autograph collection must go as soon as possible. I would prefer to sell the firearms quickly as well, but it isn't a neccessity. Thanks for looking.


GUNS: 

Custom Saiga 12 Guage Shotgun
Price: $1250 cash or $1400 trade value
This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri mail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling mount, finger groove pistol grip, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga.

Winchester 94 AE Lever Action 30/30
Price: $400 cash or $450 trade value
This is a nearly prefect example of Winchester's famous lever action rifle. This 94 AE is chambered in 30/30 and has seen very little usage. I have fired this rifle very little and used it as a brush gun during hunting season only a few select times. This gun is in excellent condition and is the closest thing that you will find to new. 

Remington 770 30/06 bolt action rifle
Price: $300 cash or $350 trade value
I purchased this rifle a few years ago and never actually fired the rifle. I took it out one time with me hunting but never had the opportunity to fire it. This rifle is chambered in 30/06 and comes with a 3-9x40 scope mounted. The scope has never even been sighted in. It also has a camo sling mounted. This would make a perfect deer rifle for someone. 

DPMS AR-15 20"" A2 target rifle with stainless bull barrel
Price: $950 cash or $1050 trade value
This rifle is the most accurate AR that I have ever shot. This is a DPMS AR-15 with an A2 stock and a 20 inch long, 1 inch diameter stainless bull barrel. This rifle has a free floating barrel and a free floating DPMS handguard, forward assist, and dust covers. The rifle also has a 6-24x44 scope that has not been sighted in. The scope has been mounted on a top rail scope mount. The rifle also has a bipod mounted. This rifle has a railed gas block and will come with two magazines as well. The stock has a few knicks and dings but nothing major. This came from shooting on a bench. The gun has been fired very little and hasn't been fired since I mounted the scope. 

Glock 22 40 S&W in OD Green
Price:$500 cash or $550 trade value
This is a brand new Glock and has never been fired. This is a Gen 3 glock and will come with two factory hi-capacity glock mags. I purchased this gun when I learned that Glock would no longer release any OD green glocks. I can include a blackhawk carbon fiber holster and two KCI extreme capacity glock mags for an additional $75. I believe they are 31 rounders but I am not positive. The last OD green gen 3 glock that was new in the box sold for over $500 with $25 shipping plus ffl fees on Gunbroker. This is going to be a collector's item very soon. Especially in unfired condition. 

Sig Sauer Platinum Elite 1911
Price:$1050 cash or $1150 trade value
This is the most beautiful 1911 that you have ever seen. This pistol has never been fired. I purchased it about a year ago and placed it in my safe. This gun has night sites installed. Checkered grip, beavertail grip safety, and many other custom features. This is a beautiful pistol and would make an excellent carry weapon or one to put up as an heirloom. This is the highest end of Sig Sauer 1911's and they are getting harder and harder to find. Comes with 2 sig sauer factory mags.

I will follow the law when selling any of my pistols or rifles. Please do not try to buy a gun from me if you are a felon or cannot possess a firearm. 


Autograph Collection
Price: $5500 or best offer

This collection is valued at over $20,000. I have much much more than my asking price invested in this collection. I am simply trying to move this collection quickly in order to put a down payment on a piece of property. I may consider trades on a few items but I really prefer cash on these autographs. I would like to sell the entire collection all at once because time is limited on my end. This would be perfect for someone to resale on ebay or for an avid collector. I simply don't have the time to sell these items individually so the first person with a reasonable cash offer will take the entire collection. I am only asking $4000 for the entire collection. You won't find a collection like this everyday, especially at this price. Below is a list of every item in my collection. I have also listed prices for what each item typically sells for. Keep in mind, I am only asking a fraction of these prices. $4000 is an absolute steal for a collection like this. I may consider shipping this collection at the buyer's expense. All of my autographs have been authenticated and all come with certificates of authenticity. Thanks for looking.

This is the best price that you will ever find. As I said, I need to sell this collection as soon as possible so please feel free to make reasonable offers. This would make an excellent investment opportunity for anyone that had the time to sell the items individually. You could really make a good bit of profit if you know how to use Ebay.

I bought a 16"" barrel for it because the 12"" one that came with it sucked. you'll get both barrels (I tried to sand down the original one so it has some scratches on it from the paper).
Also I have a big Co2 canister and a coil-hose attachment so you can attach the Co2 directly to the gun or put the canister in a back-pack making the gun a ton easier to manipulate while in the field. 
I'll also throw in 2 100rd tubes and their holster. 
Obviously the original case, barrel plugs and snake.
The only thing I don't have is the hopper connecter.
Gun has some wear and is dirty but worked awesome last time I used it, which was about 2 years ago.

The Smith & Wesson Victory Model was born from a war time request by the U.S. Military to supplement their issued sidearms with quickly tooled up civilian handguns. During World War 2, the U.S. Military sent over 570,000 of these pistols to both British and British Commonwealth forces.  The V serial number range did not begin until 24 April 1942. All previous guns, both 38 S&W (or British .38/200) and .38 Spl, were serial numbered in the K frame range up to 999,999 and do NOT have the V prefix serial number and are, therefore, NOT considered Victory models. As production neared one million, S&W considered adding an A prefix, as their SN numbering machine was only capable of stamping six digits.  Someone suggested instead to make the prefix “V” for Victory, and thus this model was named the ""Victory Model.”  (Later, the hammer block safety was introduced at V769,000 when the prefix became SV. The end of war Victory model was SV811119, after which the prefix became S and the serial numbers continued, but these were no longer Victory models.)  

… Most Lend-Lease Victory Model revolvers were originally chambered for the .38 S&W (or British .38/200) and many of these were later rechambered to fire the more popular .38 Special ammunition.  A lot of these were refurbished by Parker Hale, Ltd., or Cogswell & Harrison, - but not all of them, - which leads to various grades of quality in the rechamberings.  One issue to be aware of is that rechambering of 38 S&W (or British .38/200) cylinders to .38 Special results in oversized chambers which allow cases to possibly bulge or split. This does not affect accuracy or performance, but it does prevent the brass from being reloaded for use again.  (NOTE: This gun is NOT rated for +P ammo.)  In addition, almost all conversions retained the original .361""-caliber .38 S&W barrel rather than replacement with a .357""-caliber .38 Spl barrel, so there are claims that accuracy for some Victory's can allegedly be subpar when shooting .38 special ammo.  I took THIS revolver to the Range the other day, and shot a group of surplus M41 FMJ Ball ammo at 7 yards, and the group was low at 6 o'clock, but five shots made a single jagged hole that was smaller than a Quarter, and I dropped one shot.  I also shot a group of reloaded SWC, and I stung that into a 3” vertical spread from the bulls eye to 6 o'clock.   I am under the impression that this gun will still shoot it's original .38 S&W ammo without any of the above issues, - but I have not shot any of .38 S&W rounds through this revolver to confirm this idea.  … Based upon it's accuracy, and since this gun is professionally stamped on the frame “CAL. .38 SPECIAL” it is my assumption that the rechambering of this pistol was done by a competent armory."

It is fully compliant, has a Bushnell red dot and is easily worth more than a lower end AR. The only things the AK needs are a duracoat (due to pitting from previous owner) and barrel threads (which will both happen early next year). I may also sell the AK for the right price."

I've used these for the last five years and they have made two trips to Alaska as well as other states to hunt.  I've decided to upgrade to higher powered binoculars this year and that is why I've decided to sell them.  

They have been a good pair of bino's although the range finder doesn't range animals as good as I'd like.  I can only range deer sized targets to about 400 yards.  Pronghorn was a little tougher to range about 250 yards max unless they were in a group.  Elk sized targets would get me out to the 500 yard range.  

These binos range in meters or yard and does have the scan mode.  It takes one CR-123 battery operate.  The case has broken zippers, I don't know if you could get a new one or not.  I'd like to get $200.  One week trial period If you don't like them just bring them back to me and I'll refund your $200."

All work was done by RWS Gunsmithing. It started out as a T/C Venture rifle, and has been completely customized. Here is a list of the work done and features:

-T/C Venture Action was Trued

-XLR Aluminum Chassis System

-Bolt was spiral fluted

-Krieger 26"" barrel 1:8 Twist - Also Spiral Fluted

-Everything was nitride treated

-Custom pinned recoil lug

-EGW 20 MOA HD Mount (Steel, not aluminum)

-Surefire Brake

-The buttstock was changed to allow for ambidextrous shooting

-A Picatinny rail from XLR was added to accommodate bipods

-I have an SPR grip and an Ergo grip (the Ergo is ambidextrous) One grip will go with the rifle.

-1 10 Round Alpha Mag

-Snap Caps

This rifle has had exactly 57 rounds fired through it. It shoots like a dream. It performs perfectly, and the bolt cycles extremely smoothly. I have been shooting approximately 1/2"" groups with it, but I am not a very good rifle shooter. I know that in the right hands this rifle would be capable of even better. It is in absolutely perfect shape, and is even more impressive in person than in the pictures.

I bought it about 6 months ago, and I now realize that I have too much money tied up in this rifle. My shooting skills are not good enough to warrant such an amazing rifle until I've had more time to improve! 

The USO Scope, Atlas Bipod, and Nightforce rings are not included. However I am listing them separately if interested.

The price is $2100. Partial trades may be considered."

Second is a Ruger Old Model Single Six .22 Magnum version. This is a 1959/1960 model before they came as convertables, so this one is a .22 Magnum ( I have gotten my .22 LR cylinder to fit ). Overall good shape with signs of holster wear, but very clean and extremely slick. Original grips have a chip on the right panel, and its missing the base pin latch and spring ( I have one on the way that will be installed asap).

I know just as well as anyone else that knows Glocks. They have quit production  on these color guns and they are tough to find especially the OD 19 and 23. I'd say mine is one of the few hundred that has remained unfired when i got the gun it came factory sealed and has never been on a gun showroom floor or case so it has never been handled or wrenched back by anyone it has never even had a round in the chamber i know alot of people on guntrader are selling these ""PIECED"" together and what i mean is none of the serial numbers are matched so just to be clear this one has all matching serial numbers the barrel, slide, and receiver match. I also will throw in my Blackhawk Holster a $45.00 value if the deal is right. Please no silly offers such as High Point, Ruger P90 series or anything like that. XDM, SIG, HK, AR-15, SCAR, ACR, is along the lines of what im looking for trade to this Rare Unfired OD Glock 19. I will send pics to those interested to a cell phone number.
