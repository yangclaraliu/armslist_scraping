Trijicon HD Night Sights, green front orange rear (1 year old). With installation I paid $150
Viridian C5l Tactical GREEN laser/light combo for sub compact weapons. New I paid $325

    Glock 19 is in perfect condition, I am the original owner. Has never been carried or holstered, and not one failure in the 200 rounds I fired for break it in.
    Trijicon HD Night sights with the orange rear and green front are BRIGHT. Having contrasting orange/green gives you the ability to differentiate between front and rear in COMPLETE darkness. Trijicon is the best in the game.
    Viridian C5L green laser/light combo is the only laser/light compact and light enough to make carrying practical. The Green laser does not wash out in sunlight and is visible in lighted conditions unlike red lasers. This thing gives you a distinct advantage in any given situation, ability to fire without raising weapon to eye level, while driving or running. The high output tactical light is disorienting and features a strobe setting.

$1,125 invested in this simple, reliable package that includes some of the highest quality brands that I hand picked for their clear advantage.
   Do some research and you will see how great each part is on it's own, but put them all together and you have the ultimate 9mm set up in an unbelievably compact package.

I'd like to get what I have invested out of it and given the current market I feel that is fair.

I'm including several hundred rounds of ammo. Possibly a red dot scope, and rear sight available with it also.
The pictures don't show it, but its a very good looking gun! No noticeable scratches anywhere on the gun.  
If you have any questions, email me, I'll check it as often as I can. Once I get an email from you, I'll give you my cell and that will be easier communication.

I have added parts to the original rifle and set the bolt gap to proper specs; it has a PTR sear instead of the original G3 sear to give the trigger a smoother break, it has an improved buffer plunger and spring installed that reduced the felt recoil (the kick from the rifle is now similar to a AR-15, http://www.triggerwork.net/hksbuffer.html), the original stock has been replaced with a proper HK style stock and has a butt plate with adjustable length of pull, the muzzle brake was upgraded to a flash hider, it has a 1913 picatinny rail on top of the receiver, it has a clip on brass deflector, the hand guard has been replaced with a PTR Aluminum hand guard which will take PTR rails yet I have added a Magpul rail to the bottom and a sling swivel at the front for a Harris style bi-pod, the mag release has a taclatch installed on it.(more info at http://www.taclatch.com/default.asp) Many say that the HK91 style of rifles are the most accurate .308 semi-auto rifles available.

From the tag and the hand scribed ""HDSP"" on the receiver my guess is that this shotgun is from the High Dessert Security Prison. You don’t see a lot of LE trade ins that have an actual tag. It does not appear by the condition that this shotgun was not used much. From the serial number on the barrel it appears that this gun was manufactured March of 1977. Remington does cycles through their alphabet code approximately every 26 years, therefore March of 1994 could be another possible date but with the low serial number on the receiver I think 1977 is the date, but please verify for yourself. There are some marking on the forend probably from being stored. This gun is all original and has not been modified in any way.  

Here are some differences between the Police and Express model:
• 870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.
• All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.
• All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.
• Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer
magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.
• A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.
• A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.
• Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
• The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks.
• The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.
• The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.
• The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization.
• The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.
• The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.
• The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.
• Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

Nicest one I have seen in thirty years. The bore is NEW. Picture does not do it justice. Very little wear on nickel. Mother of pearl grips are great. This little gem appears to have been fired only a few times needing a magnifying glass to see signs of it on the gun. Nickel is 98% + with some repair marks around the lower pin just above trigger. Case color on hammer is great. The case color on trigger gaurd is good. Engraving is nice quality and a pleasant pattern. Gun operates perfectly like a new gun. Chambered in .38 S&W. I have a nice original full box of clean ammo to go with it. Screws show signs of ""turn out"", but can be replaced without harming value or originality. I like the real history of it so I have left them alone. 


 The Hopkins and Allen is a great collector peice with potential for value increase due to rarity level. They were only made from 1908 to 1915. The engraved models are by far the most rare, with this one possibly being the finest example to come up for sale in many years. Seven years of production ( 1908 - 1915) with engraved models being reported to be less than 0.10 of a percent of total production. This gun was considered to be the best of the break top small frame guns of the time due to its superior hammer function and quality latch mechanism. If it does not sell, I will be happy to hang it in the case. I am selling in hopes it wil go to a serious collector who will appreciate it for what it is. 


Will consider trades. Equal or not."

It has upgraded Tech Sights (2-position rear sight and new front sight), though I left the rear sight intact if you wanted it back to factory sights (just have to replace the front one, which I don't have anymore). 

I am including 4 factory 10rd. mags (both sets of 2 are connected back to back with a mag connector) and 2 25rd. banana style mags. All mags are steel lipped mags. I also have the manual for the gun and the guide for the Tech Sights.

I would like $275 for the entire set (will not separate pieces either). Would also prefer local pickup. Please contact me with any questions."

Serial number shows it was made in 1978, but like all Ruger revolvers, a few decades one way or the other doesn't make much of a difference to this thing. Built like a tank, adjustable rear sight, beautiful condition, locks up tight with a smooth double action pull and a nice, crisp single action trigger. Makes a great nightstand gun or CCW. Looking to trade for a full-size 1911, Ruger p345, or other .45 pistol- da/sa or single action only, I'm not a fan of striker-fired guns., will add up to 200 dollars to even out the trade depending on what you're offering. If you have something else to trade, go ahead and make an offer; worst I can say is ""no thanks"". Serious offers only, FTF with MO residents, trades only, will not sell outright."

In the 3000+ rounds I've put through this firearm, I have 1 round fail to eject (FTE).  I'm pretty positive it was the round and not the rifle.

WARNING:
I'm the type of guy who uses their firearms, not throw them in a safe and treat them as though they're God.  Most if not all of my rifles get sprayed painted camo, if you've ever experienced a black rifle in 115+ degree heat, you understand why.  If you're the type of guy/gal who likes to show how much crap you can strap to rifle, likes to look dress up in front of the mirror in your finest 5.11 get up, or be that guy who keeps a rifle in a safe like it's been banned to solitary, this is not the firearm for you.  If you want a reliable hot-lead flinger, then continue on down the page.

WASR 10 (Romanian)
11ea. steel 30rd mags (pretty sure they're ComBloc)
Romak (?) wire folding stock aka coat hanger stock(?)
3000+ rounds of various ammunition (don't worry it's that good Ruskie stuff):

-122gr.  WPA  (HP)  31 bx of 20rd. (600) (this is the older Wolf that was put out before they started laquering all their ammo producing shitty feed problems).
-122gr.  WPA  (HP)  1/3 - 1/2 (easily 200+) a .50 cal full of loose ammo (it's the above stuff).

Seriously?  I used to go to other sites for my comedy but now I find myself frequenting backpage and armslist, etc because of posts I see exactly like this.  First of all, you have a plastic gun.  Yeah, and I know it has never been fired because your Mom bought it at Wal-Mart in November and you just got it for Christmas.  Also, AR does not stand for Assault Rifle.  It is the first two letters of the company ARmalite.  A DPMS rifle really is bottom of the barrel.  And why do you have 3 flashlights on your gun?  I’ve got worse news for you, that price is not the market value.  The dems don't have the votes in the senate.  Plus, Arizona is passing a very strict anti-fed law for the state.  ""But, But federal law always trumps state law.""  Wow! You’re a real constitutional lawyer aren't you!  Fed only trumps state when there is a conflict between two laws.  The 2nd amendment is the 2nd federal law EVER WRITTEN.  Arizona's law goes hand in hand with Federal law.  Same for Wyoming, Montana, Etc.  YOU are hyping the market, preying on people who don't know a clip from a mag.  And don’t give me that,"" Well I'm a Capitalist and that's Capitalism for ya"" crock.  If you were truly a Capitalist, you'd take off that $1700 reserve for the DPMS you are selling for $1800 on Gunbroker.  ""Oh, no! I can't do that, what if I get less? THAT'S FAIR MARKET CAPITALISM FOR YA!

So, if you are reading this and are serious about a firearm of any kind, do some research.  Ask friends and family for help.  Don’t be shy.  Because just like in any business (I.E. used cars, phony insurance, etc)
You’re going to find people who are TRYING to take advantage of you.
