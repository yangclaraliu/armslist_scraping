For $130 you get delivery of the gun without the hassle of an FFL.  Must provide a copy of driver license, and sign a bill of sale. Will also consider possible trades.  Pictures to come.  Thanks for looking!

Up for sale is a 32 caliber black powder rifle that has been restored for shooting in 1958. This piece of history was found at the Pea Ridge Battlefield in Arkansas in the late 1800's. The restoration was done by Jackson Arms in Dallas. The outside metal pieces were plated to strengthen. The hammer was welded and also plated for strength. The stock was cleaned to reveal a beautiful piece of burled wood and an epoxy finish was added to seal the wood. It could be restored to the original condition if it was so desired. This would include removing the epoxy and giving the wood an oil finish and having the metal refinished to a brown or rusty appearance. The rifle was shot successfully in 1958 and hasn't been shot since. Any further shooting should be done after a complete look over by a gun smith since the metal is over 150 years old. After doing some research into the battle it appears that a Cherokee Chief and 400 warriors fought tenaciously for the Confederate cause. Its theorized that this rifle was used by a wealthy Indian in the battle. The two regular armies facing each other had larger caliber weapons with bayonet attachments. This rifle, although likely made in a small gunsmith shop, was obviously well crafted and expensive far above a federal issue army rifle. It would seem reasonable that this deer caliber rifle was used in the battle by an Indian and not a Confederate or Yankee soldier. The Indians were fighting to preserve their acquired wealth and property in farming using slaves, a fact not known by many Americans. Some of the personal effects of the Indian Chief at the Pea Ridge Battle can be seen at the museum in Jefferson, TX.
I am listing this for my father and can field most questions of the rifle. There is documentation for the rifle and a photo copy of a map where the rifle was found. Not sure what the value of the rifle actually is we will be taking offers for the rifle. Please no low balls and only serious offers. If you have taken the time to read this then you know as well as I that anything with documentation to the Civil War there is an added value placed on the item. Call or text REDACTED"

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, RugerÂ® Mini-14Â® rifles and Mini ThirtyÂ® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14Â® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles."

Don't ask me how many rnds has been through it because I really can't give an accurate answer. I have put enough rnds through it to know that I can trust it with my life no matter what brand or load I freed it (Never a hint of a malfunction) It is one of my full time carry weapon so It has its usual wear but nothing bad as its still a very good looking firearm. The trijicon sights are really bright in low light. Pic below is with the wood grips, It currently has the beretta plastic grips installed, which seems more comfortable to me. If the ad is still up then I still have it. No silly cash offers, I'm only willing to trade."

2010 NRA Handgun of the year as this is one of the lowest recoil and thinnest grips on a double stack 9mm striker fire. Comes with case, 12rd and 17rd clips, lock, magazine loader, and a new in the bag Fobus 360 belt  holster. Never carried. Asking $512 obo (or best offer) REDACTED text or call. 

The MSRP on these is $512 but this is technically used so feel free to make an offer. Trades are welcome if you have something of value.

These are ideal for people who don't like the bulk of a glock, but love the functionality and want a thinner grip. These are also very thin for a double stack so if you're carrying inside the waistband you get the feel and fit of a slim or single stack without sacrificing your round count. You also get the versatility of a small grip no ""printing"" when you conceal carry, but when open carrying during hiking/camping, or just for home protection, you can still pop in the 17 rnd magazine which is included.

The unique LWRCIâ¢ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 12â barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20â barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-Râ¢ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model (12â, 16.1â), Designated Marksman Rifle (18â), and Sniper Model (20â). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each R.E.P.R. rifle comes with one barreled upper, but extra uppers are available in light contour 12â and 16.1â, medium contour 18â and heavy contour 20â configurations. Custom packages including one lower and two or more barreled uppers are available. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. Contact our customer service department for specifications.

New for 2012, we are offering the 16â R.E.P.R. with a spiral fluted barrel. The spiral fluting shaves weight while relieving longitudinal stresses that can cause âstringingâ in barrels with conventional linear fluting. 

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with."

A Rossi SxS with hammers, in .410. These are just like their nice 12 and 20 gauge SxS but with a smaller frame for the .410. It has a 26"" barrel, is nice and tight, and has a really nice feel and balance to it. A couple of light marks on the wood but apparently has not been used much. The butt plate, the original Rossi of course, shows no wear and is still nice with sharp points.

I am the second owner of this gun and I got it from the son of the fellow who bought it new.

This would be a perfect gun for that young Cowboy Shooter, and like all of the older Rossi SxS shotguns, this has no extra safeties, making it just like the shotguns of the old days.

I have a lot more photos.  If you would like to see them just ask.

These 7.62x39 barrels were specifically built for use in the MGI Modular weapon system. However, they are standard barrels and can be mated with any standard upper as well as MGI's QCB upper receiver. Top quality, 1:10 twist, 16 inch, with front sight tower, these barrels have the new and improved mil spec black phosphate, Z class. 

MGI's new Enhanced Reliability Firing Pin and Bolt for use in the 7.62x39 AK-47 configuration of the Hydra Modular Weapon system. The Firing pin and bolt more closely mimicks a true AK-47 firing system giving much greater reliability while firing the 7.62x39 ammo. Wolf ammunition themselves recomends this enhancement while firing 7.62 ammo!!"

Even under low light conditions and during more complex operations, fast, sure target identification and acquisition is a necessity for survival in Special Operations. With the GTL 21 Tactical Light, GLOCK offers the solution for those users who cannot afford compromise. Youâll find the same, proven GLOCK Xenon illumination technology, integrated, ergonomic design, and easy operation as the light-only GTL 10. But it offers the additional tactical advantage of a powerful red class 3R Laser inserted into the shockproof and waterproof polymer housing. Simple and accurate adjustability in both axes guarantees precise targeting. Software-controlled temperature monitoring of the laser diodes permits operation in various temperature ranges.

The smoothly integrated light-Laser module mounts rigidly onto the pistolâs accessory rail in seconds. Operation is simple and ambidextrous, even with tactical gloves. It all works together with your GLOCK pistol to provide a flexible solution for practically any target illumination situationâcreating a superior tactical weapon/light system no police or military special unit should be without.

This is a Rare and Almost Impossible to Locate A1 receiver with the addition of the Period Classic Tear Drop Forward Assist and Brass Deflector behind the Ejection Port aka A1E1. It can be distinguished from the A2 receiver by its simpler rear sight. This Upper was also chosen by Diemaco (now Colt Canada) for the C7 Rifle and C8 Carbine. It was also commonly used on the Model 723 and 733 carbines. This Receiver has the Latest and Greatest Improvements before Morphing into the A2 as we know it. 
This was  also the receiver used on Colt's 9mm SMG. For this purpose it was factory modified with several holes drilled in the side, which are used to pin spacers in place to hold the smaller 9mm magazine in the standard 5.56mm magazine well. The A1E1 can be used to restore both 9mm and or 223 (5.56 Nato) models. Let me know if you are Building a 9mm and I will throw in the Pin, Spring and Spacer to convert it to 9mm use.
Selling this Unique and Rare Upper for $90.00 or Trade for a Stripped AR Lower Receiver or other parts listed. Remember that I will throw in the Springs and Pin to convert it to 9mm if you plan on building that configuration."

Comes with everything that came from the factory, along with the Galloway Precision ""Smooth-it"" kit.  I purchased this last year on an impulse buy, and it has now been replaced by another impulse buy gun ;)

I removed the factory magazine disconnect safety (very easy to re-install if needed).  I replaced both the striker blocker spring and trigger bar spring from the Galloway kit.  Included is the Galloway aluminum striker indicator and striker block as well, although they were not machined very well and seemed to make the trigger even grittier.

I lightly polished some internal trigger surfaces.  To be honest, the trigger just didn't smooth out the way I wanted it to.  With a little more work I'm sure it will smooth right out, but I went to a hammer fired SA/DA 9mm now that has a much better trigger.

This handgun has the grips and trigger switched out.  The trigger has pre travel adjustment.  The trigger is not compatable with the grip safety, and with that installed the grip safety doesn't work.  The manual safety still works fine.  The trigger I put in has a slender trigger bar in the back so it doesn't contact the grip safety, if you switched out the grip safety or trigger it would work.

The handgun comes with one 8 round magazine that came with the gun.  I have put around 200 rounds through the gun, and it has run without any malfunctions.  I've only run brass cased Winchester rounds through this gun.  This has been strictly a range gun, and has spent all of its time in a climate controlled safe.

Internal parts of the frame that contact trigger bar have been lightly polished.  The trigger bar has been polished, the trigger is very smooth and light with the least amount of travel allowable for proper function and reset.  Comes with original case, and manual with test fired round.
