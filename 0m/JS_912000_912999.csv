Listed here is a beautiful condition .30 cal M1 Carbine by ""Saginaw SG"".  From the limited research I have done, this rifle dates to around Late 1943 to early 1944.  The barrel is also marked ""saginaw"" and other markings are shown on bolt, Bayonet Lug etc..

This rifle is shown in the M1A1 Paratrooper stock however i understand that this would not have been original to the rifle as SAGINAW did not make M1A1's.  This said, it is not priced as such.

The bore on this rifle is excellent and overall fit and finish on this carbine is just as nice, especially for its age.

Feel free to ask any questions and contact me below if you need any additional pictures.

I am not really looking to trade however if you have a trade + $650 Cash I may consider.  Carbines this nice are getting harder and harder to find.  Don't forget that this does take THE DREDDED 30RND MAGAZINES!!!  So get them while you can.  Thanks!

Listed here is a beautiful condition .30 cal M1 Carbine by ""Saginaw SG"".  From the limited research I have done, this rifle dates to around Late 1943 to early 1944.  The barrel is also marked ""Saginaw"" and other markings are shown on bolt, Bayonet Lug etc that I do not know.  This rifle is shown in the M1A1 Paratrooper stock however I understand that this would not have been original to the rifle as SAGINAW did not make M1A1's.

The bore on this rifle is in excellent condition and overall fit and finish on this carbine is just as nice, especially for its age.

Feel free to ask any questions and contact me below if you need any additional pictures.

I am not really looking to trade however if you have a trade + $650 Cash I may consider.  Carbines this nice are getting harder and harder to find.  Don't forget that this does take THE DREADED 30RND MAGAZINES!!!  So get them while you can.  Thanks!

Listed here is a beautiful condition .30 cal M1 Carbine by ""Saginaw SG"".  From the limited research I have done, this rifle dates to around Late 1943 to early 1944.  The barrel is also marked ""Saginaw"" and other markings are shown on bolt, Bayonet Lug etc that I do not know.  This rifle is shown in the M1A1 Paratrooper stock however I understand that this would not have been original to the rifle as SAGINAW did not make M1A1's.

The bore on this rifle is in excellent condition and overall fit and finish on this carbine is just as nice, especially for its age.

Feel free to ask any questions and contact me below if you need any additional pictures.

I am not really looking to trade however if you have a trade + $650 Cash I may consider.  Carbines this nice are getting harder and harder to find.  Don't forget that this does take THE DREDDED 30RND MAGAZINES!!!  So get them while you can.  Thanks!

Holds 13 if you keep one in the chamber, this semi-automatic weapon locks back when the last round is fired. I think that this hand gun is firm and easy to grip, not too big, not too small.  This 9mm is very easy to take apart and clean this makes for a good first time weapon for owners new to hand guns. There is not any sign of rust on this 9mm and only very minimal wear on the exterior of the weapon.  This actual photo was taken on Wednesday 1/23/2013 I fired just short of 300 rounds through this 9mm on Monday 1/21/2013 the last I used it.   Honestly from my take on this 9mm after firing the 300 rounds, use hollow points, hollow points feed best in this gun, cheap FMJ's might start to jam if you don’t keep your railings clean, it's only a $200 gun.  I wouldn't take it to war, but it perfect for a low cost effective 9mm for practice.  9mm’s are cheaper for ammo than 380’s 40’s or 45’s, making them perfect for you if all you want to do is target practice and get used to firing. I will throw in for free a ten pack of 50ft competition targets to get you started, but I have not any more ammo. This model 9mm has a indicator that shows you from the outside of the gun if there is a round in the chamber and another indicator that shows you if the hammer is cocked and ready to fire, good for beginners, if you see both little orange indicators then you are hot for sure, so be careful, and blast it away, BANG! BANG! BANG! just don’t shoot anything breathing! $200.00 Gets you 1 Jennings 9mm, 1 12 Round Magazine, & 10 Competition Targets.  Delivery & Bill of Sale with witness will be provided upon cash/weapon handoff.  Serial number ownership transfer must be completed after private sale of firearms. Call REDACTED and leave a detailed message if you are interested in purchasing this weapon for only $200 before prices continue to sky rocket. That is a fair price for a 9mm Lugar... Anything better will cost $600.00+"

The MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit includes a complete upper receiver/ barrel assembly, bolt carrier assembly, buffer, and buffer spring allowing Mil-Spec 5.56 mm AR-style rifles to be retrofitted to HK’s pusher rod system. The Upper Receiver Kit is the core of the HK 5.56 mm proprietary gas piston operating system. It employs a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.

The same operating system is used in the combat-proven 5.56 mm HK416 as well as the G36, HK417, and a variety of other Heckler & Koch arms. The MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit is designed to be fully interchangeable with all high quality AR-style firearms, simply by attaching it to an AR lower receiver using the standard takedown pins. Due to the shortened length of the HK buffer and HK (action) buffer spring, these parts do not work in fixed stock AR-type rifles. Installation of MIL-SPEC hammers in non-HK lower receivers are required for reliable function. Additionally, the MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit does not work in lower receivers with fully automatic or selective fire mechanisms. However, the HK416 Upper Receiver Kit (available to military and law enforcement customers) is designed to function with fully automatic and selective fire lower receivers. The HK piston driven operating system virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).

The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The Upper Receiver Kit uses a German-made barrel manufactured by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging technology. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process creating a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life.

The unchromed 16.5-inch barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. A thick, heavy contour also contributes to its excellent accuracy. The Upper Receiver Kit also includes the HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard with its four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails. This premium machined alloy handguard allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The Upper Receiver Kit also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights.

HK MR556 Upper kit includes:
Complete MR556 Upper Receiver/Barrel Assembly HK 16.5 inch cold-hammer forged barrel, upper receiver with forward assist, extended convertible charging handle, HK Free Floating Rail System handguard 
Complete MR556 Bolt Group Assembly 
HK Proprietary Buffer

What I'd like:
A nice simple Ruger 10/22. Wood stock, synthetic, Takedown, whatever... just looking for a nice plinker. I am NOT looking for a ""package deal"" of a bunch of accessories, nor am I looking for one with any aftermarket modifications at all. No folding stocks, aftermarket stocks, extended mag releases, scopes, etc. I'm happy with a stock rifle, and whatever Ruger magazines you have. No rust or beat up rifles please.

What I have:
.308/7.62 NATO FMJ factory brass cased reloadable ammunition in original retail boxes, sealed battle packs and/or factory cardboard cases. I have Winchester Q3130, Federal M80C, Hirtenberger, and Prvi Partizan M80 in weights from 145gr to 149gr. Your choice. It's all boxed, nothing is loose or rattling around in a rusty ammo can.

i have a pre-cuomo ban stripped Areo Precision lower receiver i wantto sell.

if you did not get one befor etehban then this could be your last chance.  Us private citizens can do ftf private sales until March 15th.  after that no more.  you can not get complete rifles from your ffl now....so if you want to build a pre-cuomo ban ar this is your chance.  you can put any evil feature you want on it as long as you register it by next year.

so you can get a folding stock, flash hider and a bayonet lug and build it nice....as long as it is registered you can keep all the evil features.....OR you can make it a non evil rifle and you will not have to register it.  your choice.

so i have ONE stripped pre-cuomo lower reciever i will sell ftf.  you must show NY ID and sign a paper saying you can legally own a firearm and i will sell it.  asking $599.  NO trades sorry.  i am selling items to facilitate my MOVE OUT OF COMMIE NY....cause i am not registering my rifles!

On the top half of the case is a Stag Arms 6.8 upper and lower. The lower has an ambidextrous single point sling adapter and a single point sling. The upper has the free float forend, and a nickel boron bolt carrier group. I pulled it out in the pic so you can see how clean they keep. They dont get any carbon build up on them at all. The optics is a 3-9x50 basic scope zeroed in at 200yds. Its not a super high end scope, but ARs dont kick like mules either. It has been holding up to the 6.8 recoil for around 200 rounds that Ive put down it. It comes with 2 magazines stamped 6.8 and 1 box of Hornady 6.8 ammo.
The lower half of the gun case is a DPMS 5.56/.223 upper with 1:9 twist. It has quad rail forend with all the rail adapters to put over the rails if you want to use them. Also comes with a fold down foregrip attached to it. Standard bolt carrier in it also. The light is a surefire millenium universal ($350) with the M93 mounting base $175(quick release) and the KM3 light head $250 on it (switches between white light and infrared). It comes with a NcStar 4x32 scope that has a red laser on it as well and has the quick detach/attach lever. I have 2 new in the box GI style mags, 2 used mags, 3x20rd boxes of ammo, and a bag of loose reloaded ammo leftover from a box I got at a gun show last year.
The 5.56 upper will mount to the 6.8 lower perfectly and will take the 5.56 mags as well. Basically 2 uppers and 1 lower to make 2 different caliber rifles. I target shoot here and there with the 5.56 and used the 6.8 to hunt hogs in TX, although I did drop a doe with it a few weeks ago.
The entire set up was almost $2500 BEFORE the stupid rise in value of these 'assault' rifles. The surefire alone was over $500. So that being said, NO, $2000 will not come close. $3500 obo

For the right price, I'll also throw in my Smith and Wesson M&P 15-22. Excellent shape, no mods. Comes with the box and manuals and fold down grip."

In Ron Peterson's they were only selling 1 box (100 round to a box), to a customer.  In other shops today, there was hardly any to be found.

I then thought to myself, ""I have a bunch of .22 long rifle tucked away safe and sound in an ammo box.  I wonder what I could get for it all?""  

And so with that thought in mind, I am here advertising.  

This is a regular ammo box, as you can see, and it is almost full!  How many?  I don't know, but I venture to anywhere between 3000 to 4000 rounds.  Of course there is all different brands of ammo that I would buy in bulk and just throw int eh ammo box after doing some shooting.  After awahile, this stuff just added up."

I would much rather have something new... or old. 

What I have up to trade is the following:

Winchester shotgun. 28"" barrel, choke, and about 250 rounds of shotshells. this gun is in superb condition for the age of it. I would rate it at about 96 percent, minus one very small blemish on stock, and the fact that it has been fired. You couldnt't tell though. Gun has been cleaned after every time it has been out. (which is only once.) 

The next rifle is a Winchester x-150 muzzleloader. I picked this rifle up figuring that I would go hunting. But being a college student, and working full time proved different. The gun has the Winchester camo stock, the .50 cal barrel, and and an extra .45 cal barrel. both barrels are fluted. 

I am just looking for something different. I don't have a preference, so just text me some pictures with some offers!

996,http://www.armslist.com/posts/912996,For Sale:  WWII M1 Garand Rifle February 1942 Serial MINT wood Springfield Armory 30.06,"Southwest Little Rock, Little Rock, Arkansas",$ 850,"Listed On: Sunday, March 24, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is a very early WWII M1 Garand made in February 1942. This is one of the rare M1 Garands referred to as a ""six digit"" because its serial number only has six digits compared to the 7 digits for all the other millions made. The stock is excellent with no scratches, dings, cracks or even dents. The bore is mirror bright with strong rifling. Muzzle gauages under 2 which means this rifle has a lot of shooting life left in her. It is a great M1 Garand, especially if you want a very early WWII rifle. I prefer a face to face sale in Arkansas but I will ship to all 50 states to an FFL or C&R. I require a bill of sale to be done on this rifle which means I will ask you for your name, phone number, and DLN in order to prove you are an Arkansas resident. If you are unwilling to give any of these up, please don't offer to purchase the rifle. Thank you!"
