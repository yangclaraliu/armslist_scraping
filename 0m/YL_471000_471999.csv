I have no need for this set-up as I sold the rifle this gear was on. If your looking for a bullet proof scope for any rifle, the SS scope is hands down the best scope for the money period. I've got another mounted on my rather expensive 308 and have yet to find another scope I like better. I've used more expensive scopes and still come back to the SS line everytime. Asking 250.00 OBO, please dont waste my time with low-ball offers, scope alone goes for 300.00, and the Harris pod is close to 100.00. Cash only, no trades please, if you have any questions please feel free to ask! Thanks for looking.

Night sights are bright (I can see them across the room in the dark). MSRP on this gun new was almost $800 (yes I know they sell for less than that, but that is the MSRP).

Gun has 300 rounds through it and shows very little wear.  Warranty is still good. Bore is mirror bright and looks brand new. Shoots great. This thing is light (18.5 oz) so recoil is a little snappy, but it is very controllable due to good stippling and great design. You can carry it all day and not hardly feel it. This really is the ultimate CCW gun if you like carrying a 45 but don't want to put something the size and weight of an engine block in your pants. Comes with 2 mags and case.  

Must be local - cash only, face to face.  No low-ball offers will be responded to.  Just lowered price.  I have never seen one sell this low, but I could use the money."

I have only seen or was only able to find one other that was ever listed online like this. It is a Ruger MK II(mark II)stainless .22 pistol . This is a limited NRA edition that was only sold at NRA dinners and banquets back in the late 90s . It has really nice engraving on it and this is #282 out of 750. I am firm on the price as it is in wonderful shape and only has 200 rounds through it . Some people prefer the bull barrel but I think the tapered barrel looks better since it stays true to the german luger design and also it isn't as front heavy and easier for woman/children to learn on. Comes with original box, paperwork, two mags . 



Va residents ONLY  ,FTF sale $650 FIRM, no lowballers please 
NOTE- If my guns price bothers you , move on because I do not need to know about it. I have seen one just like it sell on gunbroker for more than I am asking and I even had a guy from florida who was willing to buy mine and pay shipping but I didnt want to go through the trouble of shipping it. I have sold every gun I have listed for what I am asking and had this one sold a while ago and backed out because I decided to keep at the time. 

Stainless models Mark II's on gunbroker are going for alot (around $550)and its very hard to find the standard barrel in stainless much less an NRA engraved edition. If I can't get $650 I will keep it to pass down to my stepson."

Old renickel/rechrome. Factory markings are intact, but softened.

 It comes with some extra parts, as shown in the pics. It has the original hand and a new replacement. The new replacement is in the gun and the old one is shown in the pics. It comes with a replacement hand spring, shown in the pics. The original is in the gun and may not need to be replaced. It comes with a replacement trigger spring, which is in the gun. The original (what is left of it) is shown in the pics. Has a set of repro stocks that need to be fitted to it, and an original stock screw, but the escutcheon got lost. It has a replacement hammer spring, which needs to be fitted. It is is shown in the gun, but it is not connected to the hammer strut - needs to be fitted to do that. The replacement hammer screw won't thread into the sideplate, as shown in the pics. I don't know if the threads are incompatible or there is a bur in the sideplate. It still needs a rear triggerguard screw and the aforementioned stock escutcheon.

The bore and chambers are actually suprisingly good. The chambers have some very light pitting. The bore has patches of moderate pitting, but still has nice rifling and pretty decent shine. Once the mechanics of the gun are fixed, it should be plenty shootable.""
 I have no time for this project. So,my loss is your gain. There are $208.00 worth of new parts that come with it(see pics). I am asking $400.00 plus shipping for it. Has to go to an FFL or C&R.

This is a decent gun chambered in 22 short. The barrel is 24” long and the bore is decent. There are traces of blue here and there on the octagonal barrel but basically this is a 0 finish gun. The patina is beautiful.  The wood is good with no cracks and shows no evidence of being sanded or refinished. There is a bolt that was put through the grip a long long time ago. Mechanically the gun is fine. There is no rust or rust pits on the gun. Shipping is $28.00 if required; I am working for an FFL dealer, paperwork required or local pick-ups.

The All American 2000 pistol was designed by the Reed Knight, Jr. and Eugene Stoner (of M16 fame), at the time both working at Knight's Armament Co. The design of the Knight's Model 2000 pistol has been purchased by Colt in attempt to bring to the market a more or less up-to-date 9mm design, suitable for police use.
All American 2000 is short recoil operated, locked breech design that uses rotating barrel locking. Barrel have five radial locking lugs that securely engage the slide; upon recoil, a separate lug on the underside of the barrel follows the cam-shaped cut in the frame insert, and thus rotates barrel to unlock from the slide. Trigger is of double action only type, striker-fired, with automatic trigger safety. Magazines were of double stack design, magazine release button located at the base of triggerguard. Sights were fixed, rear sight blade dovetailed to the slide.

Also, you must be a Kentucky resident and have a valid KY driver's license (KY CCDW okay) to purchase/trade my gun. Just email me for any questions. The pictures does not do the gun justice. It is really absolutely one of the best Smith & Wesson revolvers that I ever own. And believe me, I had plenty. Thanks for the boards Armslist. Thanks for looking."

UPDATE:::: Due to the number of requests wanting to know the model, it is a M885. this model goes for more than the other rossi models in 38 on gunbroker, this includes the model 68 that sells for around 150 on gunbroker and the r351 which seems to sell for somewhere between the 150-200 range. here is a link to an 885 in the completed listings on gunbroker which shows what it actually sold for with 14 bids so well sought after, not just what people are asking: http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=282701763. As you can see these are rossi's better models, well built little 38s. in addition, on gunbroker firearms go for substantially less than real market value, as one has to pay ffl transfer fees, in some cases both ways + shipping. if you think i am just saying that to raise the value of my firearm, pick anyone of your current firearms and see what they go for in the completed listings, it will be less than what you are willing to take, i assure you.

Introducing the latest high quality AK part manufactured by Arsenal, Inc. 

The AK-47 type Compensator for 7.62x39 caliber rifles carries the Arsenal Inc logo and the “US” marking as a testament to its uncompromising quality. The new compensator combines a slick design with detailed attention to perfect functionality and workmanship. 

This compensator is made in one piece and incorporates the ever popular cresset design. The one-piece design creates a perfectly symmetric compensator, resulting in an equal amount of excess gas escape and uniform recoil reduction with no negative effect on accuracy. 

Utilizing precision cutting machines, Arsenal Inc. ensured that the unit is coaxial, with the threads and the two concentric circular openings being centered and perpendicular to the cylindrical body of the compensator. 

The combination of high grade tool steel and sophisticated heat treating process in vacuum furnaces result in a compensator that maintains its perfectly cylindrical shape, free of any warping, deformation, collapse, or surface contaminants. 

The consistent and precision cut 24x1.5mm right-hand threads eliminate the wobbly effect common with other units. The compensator remains rock solid even if the incorrectly cut threads on your front sight block do not allow it to screw on flush with the wall of the block. 

Summary: 
Compensator, US made for AK-47 (7.62x39 caliber) in AK-74 style. Fits directly to front sight block 24x1.5mm right-hand threads (DOES NOT FIT DIRECTLY ONTO BARREL). One piece “half moon” design."

I had the trans rebuilt last year then a few months later the speedo started jumping.between 0-20mph. I took it back to the shop and they went out of business (just my luck). Took it to another shop and was told it was the TCM (trans control module) they put a new one in and worked fine for a few days and started doing it again. I am sick of dealing with it after $2k in trans work so I want to trade it for some new toys. Trans shifts fine just speedo jumps around when stopped works normal when driving.  Tires are good and radiator new last year. Could use brakes but pads and shoes have liftime from auto zone and the rotors are one brake job old.

Thank you!

For sale: Hi-Point .40, only owner, original cardboard box and all paperwork, two magazines, original sights on it, with the ghost ring sight with associated allen wrench for installation in the box.

Very accurate, rugged and has been reliable.  My wife has shot it (recently, more than I have) and likes it compared to other .40's for the lower perceived recoil.  We feed it Federal .40 FMJ and some Winchester WB, no problems, though the magazines are a real bear to get that 10th round in, so we mostly stay with 9 rounds.  Shot lightly in the four or so years we've had it, cleaned about 200 rounds ago.  Have run around 2000 rounds through it, probably less.

Last major time I shot it was for concealed carry qualification, where it performed well when I did my part.  Please stop laughing, no I don't concealed carry a Hi-point .40, as it's just too large!  Even so, she's built like a tank and goes bang when I pull the trigger with minimal issues.

Would consider trade for a well-worn but still serviceable pistol, as long as we can reach an equitable compromise.  Thank you for reading and I hope you got at least a smile when you read this."

Item Description: Great for conceal carry, and its much more slim than the regular 1911 around the grip! Outstanding firearm, accurate even at 30 yards. 1 owner, i purchased the weapon from Adventure Outdoors on 12/21/2011 for $820 (new). Wanting $675 cash for the pistol, PARA ORDNANCE case, 2 magazines, PARA safety lock cable, owners manual, and original receipt from purchase. The gun itself without a mag weighs in at 32oz, semi-automatic, holds 7+1 .45 ACP rounds, 3.5'' barrel Integral match grade barrel, Griptor grasping grooves, spurred hammer, red fiber optic front sight with 2-dot rear night sights. The gun has only been fired with approximately 150 rounds (3 boxes of 50rds.) I feel $700 is a more than fair price considering thats 15% off the gun value new in store and i am sure you wont find one like this as clean as i keep my gun. All of my guns get cleaned once after each day of shooting and then from there on once each month- im a bit of a perfectionist. The gun is in like new condition, i cherish this weapon as its my second 1911 but i must sale since i have been out from work the last 3 weeks with a recovering sprained ankle. I am only interested in serious inquiries, no trades and cash only. I will only meet in a public place and there will be (2) bill of sales that will need to be signed for each party i will provide. Willing to drive to surrounding areas of acworth, kennesaw, cartersville, woodstock, and even calhoun. I need this money for bill purposes and have other things that i must sell, so no low balling please. REDACTED call or text

This is a cool looking rifle that is supprisingly lightweight.  Only reason i havent shot it is that i dont have a good place to shoot long distance.  I would sell it for the right price, but im most interested in trades. Most of the trades i would want would also need to involve cash (either your way or mine).  So here are someof the things i can think of, but send me any offers, worst I can say is ""no thanks""!

This .38 Special version of the Smith 640 was made for only a few years.

version is sought out due to it's shorter barrel and lighter weight when
compared to the longer and heavier .357/640 model.
