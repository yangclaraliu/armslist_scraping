There will be a meeting January 10th from 5:30P to 7:30P at the Madison county Library in Berea to investigate the possibility of creating a, Friends of the National Rifle Association (FNRA) Regional Chapter. It is not necessary to be a National Rifle Association member to participate. We had an initial meeting in November and enough people attended that gave us reason to hold another meeting and depending on interest move forward. 
This is not a shooting club, gun club or hobby club. The intention is to create a Chapter that involves friends both new and old and is family oriented.

It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

I'm selling my Colt 1911 in great condition and with upgrades.
It has a nice blue finish, with minimal wear; it's only been about 150 rounds since I've owned it with no malfunctions.
I'm not the original owner, however I bought it when it had 250 rounds through the tube. 

- After a total of 400 rounds, I've replaced the whole spring system with upgraded Wilson Combat springs; break-in period (or rather, I'd like to call the my gun is sucky period) is done. Figured I'd start with a new spring set.
- This Series 1991 comes with the half moon feeding ramp barrel not the surplus duckbill feeding ramps that are prone to higher chances of malfunction

What it comes with
- It will come with original packaging
- 2 Colt factory magazines
- Factory Colt black rubber grips
- Laser Grips
- Changed out the original polymer mainspring housing with a metal factory one. (not a big fan of plastic on my 1911)

Pick up in Lafayette and we do an FFL transfer at applied ballistics. 

$1100 and I will  pay for transfer

The reason a transfer is important to you is that you KNOW this rifle is NOT STOLEN and that you are buying from someone legally able to own a firearm in the state of Indiana.

We are seeing this now with private sales up due to the threat of a ban (regulation). Subsidies affect the prices in both retail and private sales. Subsides cause subsidised brands to be cheaper that they would be for competition that is not subsidized (at the tax payers expence).  It affects prices that people pay for them at all levels because the products enter the market at an artifcially low price.
I'll give the definition of ""free market"" one more time and if anyone still thinks private gun sales are not ""restrained by government interferance, regulation or subsidy""...then so be it.
This is not a blog so I'll quit posting....just can't stand the free market getting blamed for high prices. If the market were actually free gun owners would be enjoying more guns at much cheaper prices.
Have a great day and happy shooting! Check out Milton Friedman for more info about how free markets work!

Even the dealers are jacking up the price.  No Bushmaster is worth $1950.  I will never do business with your shop again.  I now regret buying the Glock mags the other month from you.

Do all you idiots, who are paying these 2x-3x higher prices, realize that:

If they are banned -you'll have to pay another $200 to register em only to have them taken away in another year or two....

or

If they are not banned.... you just paid $1950 for a $700-$800 Bushmaster.


P.S. 
Does anyone want to but my Ruger 10/22?    I'm only asking $2500.  Better hurry.  Its hard to find now and they are on the list to be banned as well......"

Once the ban goes into place, you will not be able tobuy a high capacity magazine unless it has proof of manufacture date on it., since very few have that, you will not be legally able to buy or sell these anymore.

Runs and 4x4 works great, but shows age.  Plenty of small problems, but no major problems.  The biggest problem is probably exhaust leak.

I don't want to waste anyone's time, so here is a FULL list of problems:
- crack in front windshield
- stolen radio w/ broken trim (still have trim for repair)
- front tires have very little tread and need replaced
- exhaust leaks
- dent in back bumper (cosmetic) from tree
- Probably needs new brake pads
- Driver's seat is worn with pad showing.
- Hood clear coat is faded off

GOOD THINGS:
- 4x4 is a beast
- AC works (needs charging)
- Power windows work
- Huge sunroof works and does NOT leak.
- Full size (oversize) spare tire with good tread
- Plus reg spare tire on back of truck
- Strong roof rack
- No rust
- New battery

From Damascus Gun shop in damascus, Syria, i mean VA. 
Anyway, I bought this some months ago as I am a huge CZ fan and their rimfire bolt rifles have saved me time and money in finding the perfect 22 rifles that I will keep forever. 
I am offering this to anyone who might have been looking for one and wants to get one minus taxes/shipping before i send it in to my smith for some work. If it doesn't sell here for what I have in it I will continue with the original plan of making it the ultimate semi auto small game 22. It is handy, and with a target crown and a 2lb trigger (I heard lots about the factory trigger being stiff), this rifle will be on par or better than a sporterized 10/22 - and 10/22s can cost over $600 once you're through with them.

For those that aren't familiar with CZ 22's, they are notorious for grouping up right out of the box with iron sights at 50 yards like a dream. For those unfamiliar with the 512, the feature that really stands out is the side-by-side springs in the action, which makes the whole thing not only over built but recoils almost zero.

Included for $450 is the rifle, 5 rounder, in box with papers, and a 10 round CZ mag (purchased new, $35)
$430 for rifle with its 5 round mag
rifle is ready for quik release swivels

again, I do not need to sell this now, only offering it up before it gets altered permanently."
