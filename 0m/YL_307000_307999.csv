Barrel is a standard chamber not bentz so you can shoot any ammo throghu it. .17 barrel is same way but matches the paint on the receiver. Bipod is harris low profile and is included in the price. Stock is bell and carlson tactical varmint stock. All these items are researchable online to see pricing. Trigger has been upgraded to timney as well as all internals. only stock part on the rifle is the receiver. Also included in the price are all of the original stock parts for the rifle to turn it back to how it was originally bought from walmart. The entire project took over a year and a half to assemble and has yet to be truly tested. On an indoor range I have fired 50 rounds a piece thru both new barrels. With the .17 I was getting 5 shot groups at about a half inch. This is expected however this rifle was built with the 200 to 300 foot mark in mind. I dont have easy access to the ranges so thats why im selling it. Asking price is set at $1200 cash or trades equal to that. The parts indiviually will total over 1500. Im looking for a 500 SW magnum, a original skorpion .32 acp kit complete with receiver or most any big bore firearm. All offers are currently being accepted though. Josh"

Bought it two months ago. I have shot 250 rounds through it( 115/124  grn ball and JHP./+P) with no stoppages of any kind. This is smaller, heavier, thinner than a glock 19. Better conceal-ability, all steel construction, top of the line KAHR-not the cheaper polymer with inferior internals. It is dead accurate. I really like the gun, but I am wanting to go back to .45acp.

A Grip Pod System genuine, grip pod not a cheep knock off. And an EOTech 552 NV compatible revision F holographic weapon sight, powered by 2 AA batteries, with extras in the stock. This is a serious assault/battle rifle, sling mounts are built in and ready for any sling of your choosing. Couple extra magazines, maybe one or two of the new Surefire 60 or 100 rounders, drop bipod, set up shop, and become a one man road block. This gun takes standard AR-15 magazines and has become the new standard of reliability solving many of the issues that plagued the AR designs. Folds up small enough to throw in the trunk or back seat, and has been a well proven design for years now. I am in most need of cash but might consider a trade, particularly a good 1911 or AK but I am up to other offers, let me know the worst I can say is no. Thanks for the look."

Buyer must be over 18 and show Washington or military ID

This is a very good example of what a WASR can be when it's built right. 
No canted gas block or front sights. A little bit of mag wobble with empty steel mags, but that goes away once the mag is loaded. Less than 400 rounds through it. I have had 0 malfunctions with it, and have cleaned/lubed it after every shooting session. I have only used new-manufactured steel-cased ammo and haven't put anything corrosive through it. It's been well taken care of.

Romanian-made receiver. New Romanian-made chrome-lined barrel in very very excellent shape. Front trunnion shows that the parts kit was from 1982. Front trunnion also has the triangle/arrow stamping; means that the parts are from a de-milled military rifle (better quality than early WASRs, not leftover junk).  Has a Tapco G2 trigger group. Definitely one of the better WASRs around.

Comes with:
-6 steel mags
-Romanian mag pouch
-Butt-stock cleaning kit, cleaning rod, and oiler
-Bayonet
-Ghetto-rigged canvas/carabiner/paracord sling (in true third-world fashion!)

Here's a little more information about Manurhin Walther PP's for those of you who may be interested. Walther licensed production of the PP series pistols to Manurhin in 1952. The Manurhin continued to manufacture the PP series until 1986. In fact, all postwar European-made PP series pistols manufactured until 1986 were manufactured by Manurhin, even though the pistol slide may bear the markings of the Walther factory in Ulm."

    * Brand new Smith factory fancy walnut grips- 65

    * 4 boxes of ammo, Blazer is missing 10 rounds, Hornady XTP is missing two rounds, rest is complete.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol.

It's a fantastic rifle, but I want to trade it for an M14. I would prefer an M14 Socom. It needs to be Springfield and it's ok if it has a lot of rounds through it as long as it works. May also trade for a pair of pistols that catch my eye (sub compact Glocks, 1911's, military pistols, etc.) or one Colt 1911 or a brand new (or like new) HK USP .45 Compact or HK P2000. If you have any cool assault rifles or battle rifles let me know. But if it's an M1 Carbine it needs to be WWII because I hate the after markets. My M4 comes with 4 30 round mags (2 metal, 2 polymer), a one point sling, and 200+ rounds of .223 and 5.56. The rifle is multi caliber which means it's rated for .223 and the higher pressures of 5.56. Has a biohazard symbol ingraved on the magazine well along with the spike's tactical logo on the other side. It has an H&K style selector switch. Cash price is $1100 firm, but I'm not in a hurry to sell it. Just want an M14 mostly."

Here is the description of the Gun off of Sigs website:

BECAUSE BEAUTY AND FUNCTIONALITY AREN’T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
 SIG SAUER® pistols have long provided their owners with peace of mind. Now the SIG Sauer Custom
 Shop Equinox series adds pride of ownership to that feeling. The distinctive polished slide flats and
 nickel controls contrast with the dark-coated surfaces for a visually arresting two-tone appearance. When
 combined with its practical features, the Equinox series is pretty to look at and beautiful to shoot.

The P238 Equinox®, it’s just a fraction of the size of our ful-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® rear Night Sight and Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Front Sight. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine."

The slide is further accented by polished cocking serrations and a Flat Top which enhances the two-tone aspect of this pistol.

I am looking to trade or sell my Kahr cm9 with 6, 7 and 8 round magazines. Duo-tone with polished ramp. I have multiple holsters for it as well. I bought it new last year and have put about 350 - 400 rounds through it. Pretty much perfect condition. I take good care of my investments. Cleaned within 1 day after shooting EVERY TIME. Now want to move into something else so looking to trade for an AR - 15. If you have one and would like to trade please let me know what you have (Brand, magazines, accessories, length of barrel, etc) and how much cash and the CM9 you would like. Lets see if we can make a deal.

Here is the info on what I have for this pistol and what comes with it:

purchased in May of 2011 for $499.99 (before tax) - yes I have the receipt

Original case  and everything that came with it.

2 magazines (7 and 8 round) from Kahr @ $40 a piece from Kahr - total of $80 + shipping
2 grip extension from Kahr @ $15 total + shipping

2 holster - both inside the waist - total of $100 paid for both - one is a single clip cheaper model ($35) and the other is a double clip more expensive one ($65)

so that is a total of $685 that I have put into it since May of 2011 - I still have the receipt in hand

I know they sell them new on here for $379 but after taxes that is $408 and then if you wanted to get 2 extra mags @$40 a piece plus shipping it would be about $90. Then you have to get the grip extender for the 6 round mag at $15 plus shipping. Then get a holster for $60.. you are looking at $575... then you have to put at least 200 rounds through it to make sure it is broken in at $10 a box of 50 for a total of $40 just on ammo. so you can spend over $600 like I did, or get this one for around $500.

You must have your Permit to purchase or PTC in order to make this trade or purchase so please don't email if you don't have it."

With the overmold grips, this thing is not that bad to shoot either and actually fun to shoot with .44 Specials. This pistol comes in the original box with all original paperwork. The revolver is roughly ten years old and does not have the internal lock that all new ones do. The pistol appears to have not been shot much at all. No stains on the cylinder face, or lead build up around the forcing cone. The only sign it has been used is a light turn mark on the cylinder. New these pistols are approaching $1000. If you have been holding out for a big honking stainless steel .44 wheel gun, now is your chance to own this 6 shooter at a great price.

I got it recently and I've never really used it except to check that it is working. It will come with a battery, charger, cleaning rod and a metal magazine.

Chronos consistently at 370 fps with a .2 bb.
As far as airsoft rifles go you can't beat an m4. Best  ergonomics and the
most customizability. Sling bbs at your buddies at faster than 10 bps.

Remember this is the electric blowback model so as far as aegs go it doesn't get much more realistic than this. Perfect rifle for airsofting or anyone interested in firearms in general. Cheap way to train your kids or
grand-kids in the basics of shooting and firearms safety. Practice weapon manipulation, trigger control and sight picture acquisition all from the comfort of your own home.

This is brand new all the extras are still in their plastic packaging so I'm asking 160 obo.
I'm also interested in trades particularly other airsoft items or FOID stuff.
I'm willing to add cash to make deals fairer and you should be to.

Believe it has 5-6 settings to extend back. It is awesome, but I just want a simple fold under or to the left side bar, nothing fancy, just functional.
Also have the Forend and Upper Handguard also black synthetic with the rails on top and both sides (1 side is sling hookup) and a forend grip on bottom, put on light, sight.....
Everything works fine and is in great condition, 
I'm up for a simple even trade if your interested. 

I want bare bones stock,(left folding, or fold under)  forend, and upper handguard

While a .44 caliber frame, the frame can be built as a .36 caliber Navy; so long as you don't mind the tiny cylinder/frame gap in the front. A .36 caliber cylinder and barrel will fit perfectly, as will the Navy grip. Or go for the big bore and make it a .44 - being a Pietta made frame the possibilites are many.

There are a few dents and scratches on the wooden stock but the barrel and receiver are clean and no rust. Average velocity of the .177 pellet when new was 750 fps and 10.74 ft/lbs of energy.  The break action barrel  requires a strong arm to compress the spring and cock.  This is not a kid’s toy rifle.  Parts and supplies are available thru Beeman.  Weight 7 lbs.  Length 41 inches.

Comes in the factory bag and box with the gun lock and all paperwork.
Comes with 2 mags. 1 factory mag and 1 Tripp Research mag I purchased seperately.

Bought this a week ago (impulse buy) and decided I wanted to start an AR project so I'm selling it for less than I just paid. Its a great balanced gun and slim enough for a great ccw pistol. If I dont sell it then I'm not real upset.
This is not a used pistol and is not priced as a used pistol. A 1911 pistol in 9mm is not a common pistol. 
If you do not like the price then share one that you found was better after you add sales tax in state or ffl transfer fees from out of state and I'd be happy to deal with you."

If you want 15 rounds of 12 guage mayhem in your hands right now, then e-mail me. Otherwise, please keep your ""overpriced"" comments to yourself. By just not contacting me and rambling on about how your brother's cousin's uncle's dog-walker's friend's sister has 5 of 'em for $300 each lets me know you don't want to buy it."

I have a Springfield Loaded Target, that has been a jewel to me. I am the original owner and have only shot about 350-400 rounds through it. It has many upgrades, all which will come with the gun along with the lifetime warranty from springfield.
The upgrades include:
- S&A 1-piece Magwell
- Wilson FLGR & plug
- Wilson bulletproof spring set
- Polished feed ramp
- 10-8 Flat trigger
- VZ grips (blasted canvas)

Now, for those if you who feel that you need justification for pricing, here's a breakdown by part.

- !911 Springfield Loaded Target ($900)
- VZ grips ($75)
- S&A 1-piece Magwell ($90)
- Wilson Full length Guide rod and plug ($30)
- Wilson spring set ($35)
- 1 Wilson ETM Mag ($35)
- 1 Wilson 47D mag ($30)

-All of this comes to a total of $1200. The gun is in pristine firing condition. It has been carried,(tucker leather holster) so it has a few signs of wear. These small signs are why I can't sell it for top value. If you'd like the gun without the mags, and grips, I'll do $1050. Let me know if you have any questions, I am available at all times of the day.

I'm selling my Browning Silver Stalker with 28"" and a 3 1/2"" Chamber.   I purchased this gun not quite a year ago and then bought a Citori this summer.  Have been contemplating whether or not selling this gun for several months now and have finally decided to sell it since I need the money for competitions.  Like I said, I purchased this gun not even a year ago at JAX for $1,294 and then had a gun smith drill and install a HiViz sight ($65) total.  So for a gun that has hardly been used and not even a year old you are getting almost $500 off!  I am however open to offers but they must be within reason.  I am also willing to throw in the hard case I bought for it for an additional $50.

I have 4 original Sig Sauer P238 Magazines, 3 are 6 rounders and 1 is a 7 rounder with the butt plate.

I will not split them up or take less than $100. 

This is a package deal for the right person.  The 6 rounders are $30-$35 and the 7 rounder is about $40-$45 so $100 is more than fair.  

I didn't even fire my 238 with a couple of these so they arfe as good as new.  No dirt or anything, sold my 238 so the magazines are not needed anymore.

Howa Escort MarineGuard™ Home Defense shotguns are the long-standing workhorses of the Escort Home Defense line. These shotguns feature a rifle-style front sight on an 18 inch, cylinder bore barrel. The AimGuard comes with a black synthetic stock and matte black metal finish, while the MarineGuard is offered in water resistant nickel finish and black synthetic stock. These pumps both have short stroke actions for quick repeat shots over a 5 round tube magazine, and have large, easy to find slide releases ahead of their trigger guard. Their short barrels make them ideal for tight spots and easy handling. 
The MarineGuard is built like a swiss watch! You can feel the premium Hatsan quality in the Escort MarineGuard. 6 rounds capacity and weighs 6.25 pounds. Escort MarineGuard is designed specifically for defense use. The MarineGuard has an 18-inch cylinder-bore barrel, five-shot magazine, and nickle finish. The Escort has the fastest pump action of any shotgun I have ever fired. Faster than many semi-autos!

Selling because I sold my P226 .40, so I really do not need this.  This barrel is all you need to shoot .357sig from any model P226 chambered in .40s&w, just drop it right in and your shooting .357, uses the same mags and recoil spring as your 40.  If you're looking at this listing I'm sure you know that these sell for $180 - $225 new or used when you can find one! This is priced for a quick sell @ $100, actually it's a steal at that price... so if you want it, don't dilly-dally around because I doubt it will last long at this price.   $10 shipping to just about anywhere outside of FTF meeting range for me.

This weapon is in 95% condition.

2. Wilson Combat stainless steel full length guide rod.
3. Ed Brown stainless steel beavertail.
4. Ed Brown stainless steel Commander hammer.

All work was done by Gunsmoke Guns outside Denver Colo. when I was stationed in the Army close to there several years ago. If you are ever by there you should stop in and check it out. It is quite the gun store. And now I guess they have a TV show.

Parts and labor to fit and install cost 550.00. Base pistol price was 700.00. Total 1250.00. Selling for 875.00

If you can buy the basic pistol and parts for alot cheaper, and put the parts on yourself, THEN DO IT. Dont whine and cry about the price of this pistol, because you really want this gun, but dont want to give what I want for it, or even come close. 
Pistols like this dont turn into turds, and become worthless after 500 rds and 7 years of flawless maintenance.

This pistol is more for the person who appreciates a fine weapon, and is NOT a wannabe gunsmith, or hobbyist, who does not care that labor costs money. Sure, you can look up parts prices on Ebay, etc. all day and do figuring and come up with a lower price, but, that does not reflect what you pay when you have it all dealt with at the same reputable place. When you buy the pistol at a gun store and have them order, then fit and install the parts, it costs money. I have found several real gunsmiths right now that charge 75.00 just to install a beavertail, not to mention the 8 other upgrade parts on this pistol, so it adds up. In the end, buying a pistol like this with what it has for the price is a great deal, looks and operates top notch, and it is ready to go and shoot, with no waiting or spending more money. Most people, like myself, are not gong to disassemble a gun beyond cleaning and try to do this themselves, as one small mistake can possibly cost someones well-being or life, or render the gun useless and worthless. 

I made the mistake of buying one of these Armlist Wichita wannabe gunsmith's firearms, (and they know who they are) who stated that it had been Duracoated, and had a trigger job, when in fact it had been spray painted, and filed a bit, which after shooting a few hundred rounds, the paint that made it inside the receiver of the weapon started to come off causing the internals to gum and seize up and the weapon catastrophically failed. A costly lesson learned. If the listing says Duracoated and you go to look at it, have a quick smell, if it smells like spray paint, it is. True Duracoat is an epoxy type coating and does not in any way smell like spray paint. Also, your fingernail will not affect a Duracoat finish in the slightest.

Pretty firm on the price, this is a nice 45, ready to go. Might have a little leeway, if I dont have to drive anywhere.

This is a private sale with no paperwork or FFL, unless you have it shipped. Will ship to FFL. Buyer pays shipping.

I am not really looking for any trades, but might entertain 1911 9mm, 10mm/.40, .45 trades. Rock Island brand or better. + cash.

Email if interested. I'm not in a hurry to sell and am not hard up for cash."
