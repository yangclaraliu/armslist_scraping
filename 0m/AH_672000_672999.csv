I am not sure if these will sell here but since I would trade for quality firearms I thought I would try here first. If you are a collector or pro musician you will probably know what these are. Carvers are one of the best pro amps and this one like the Furman xover has only been used in my home stereo. They work perfectly! The Carver was sent to the factory for updates several years ago and stored. I have moved to a condo and havent used these in several years now. I had them on a rack so they do have marks but they were used to drive vintage Altecs VOTs so you know thet have never been pushed. I know what these are going for on Ebay so this is a reasonble price. These were made in America not like most of the junk they are selling today. If you don't know what they are then Google to get the full specs.NO low ball offers please. I'm not desparate for money

I am looking to sell my CZ-82, it's been a great gun for me, but I'd like to get something along the lines of a full sized handgun.

This is an excellent shooter, DA/SA, amidextrous mag release and safety.12+1 capacity, fires the 9x18 Makarov round. I have fired maybe 300 rounds since I got this gun, and the polygynal rifling, coupled with the fixed barrel makes this gun very accurate, I was easily able to put 12 rounds into a 3 1/2 inch group at 15 yards the first time I shot it. Some wear on the slide, the finish has chipped off, this is very common with these guns as the finish wasn't very good, but gun functions flawlessly, have never had a FTF or FTE.



Whole package includes

-(3) 12 rounds magazines with milled floorplates

-Black leather military surplus holster

-Desantis 106-v5 IWB leather gun holster, for ruger lc9 (also fits CZ-82 as shown nicely, the lip is a bit chewed up, dog got to it, but isn't uncomfortable or noticable when wearing and wears nicely.)

-Military/Police surplus leather shoulder holster, this is very nice and comfortable, it has never ben used, as the leather had yet to be molded to the shape of the gun when I got it, but has some light wear from handling/storage.

-(2) 50 round boxes of Brown bear 94 grain FMJ's

-(1) 50 round box of Prvi Partisan brass cased, reloadable 93 gr FMJ's

- 28 rounds of steel cased russian 9m mak ammo, 92 gr FMJ

-6 Glaser safety slugs

-13 rounds of Hornday XTP hollowpoints

The CZ-82 has an upgraded 16lb wolff recoil spring, over the factory 14 pound, helps reduce the already tame recoil.

Comes with upgraded recoil spring, the original recoil spring, and a new firing pin spring as well.

Those serial # were 534000/599000.
 After the 8 September 1943 armistice between Italy and the Allies, the Germans saddled Beretta with three engineers from Germany. Moreover the factory was garrisoned by the waffen ss!!! 'armed security service' Weapons of that time, even the ones produced for the Germans, bore the punch mark 4UT, (Quarto Ufficio tecnico di Controllo Armi e Munizioni--4th Technnical Control Unit...
-an C. Still, in Axis Pistols, page 107, states,
""It is likely that almost all of the 4/UT, ...were used by the German Army"". He also includes two other variations in this statement, ""1944 dated and blank slide Model 1935"".
Ugo Menchini, in Pietro Beretta Le Automatiche, regarding an M1934, page 255, states,
""In late 1940 there appears an oval including the punch mark IVU. It refers to the 4th technical Control Unit of the FAG, where inspection was carried out.""
 Note that, while they seem to represent the same inspectors, the ""IVU"" is not the same mark as the ""4UT"". The IVU would be found on the pre RSI model M1934, and the 4UT would be found on the RSI model M1935.
 These are the reasons why I believe that it is likely that all of the 4UT Berettas WERE RSI pistols!! the IVU and the 4UT were the same office, but under Italian management -the IVU, before the surrender of Italy, and German the 4UT, so after september, 8 1943.........
 Mussolini was rescued by German paratroopers led by Otto Skorzeny. He was then installed by the Germans as the President of the Italian Social Republic (RSI). The RSI was to be an Italian regime which was to nominally administer the German-occupied northern Italy. As the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale (MVSN, also known as ""Black Shirts"") was disbanded by the terms of the armistice, the Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana was formed on 24 November 1943. The ""Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana"" was formed out of local police, ex-army, and others still loyal to the fascist cause.
pistol is in near unissued condition and a prime example of strain on axis weapons fabrication late in the war, with tooling and machinery marks throughout, it comes with one extra original period magazine!!!!!!!!

566,http://www.armslist.com/posts/672566,For Sale:  M-11 9mm Semi/Full Auto Double Threaded Barrel,"Middle TN, Tennessee, United States",$ 75,"Listed On: Saturday, September 7, 2013",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"If you want the versatility of a standard 3/4x10 9mm thread and also want a 1/2x28 thread, then this is the barrel for you!!!!

The barrel is super easy toninstal. My first one I put on took m about 12-15 mins' but on my last MAC it took 4 mins to change the barrel. Its just a super well built easy to work with and has all the treads you'd ever need to have. Ihave them on all my MACs and M-11's. I just order one too many this last order, my fault will end up your win!

This barrel is very cool because it allows you to have multiple threads on just 1 high quality made barrel. I have them on all my SMG MAC and the first one i installed is still on and probably close to 24-28k rounds through it and still as accurate and has not faded any since the day it was installed. That's why I have them on all 6 of my SMG's .

For the barrel being sold, I opened the package to make sure it was perfect in aesthetics and to check the thread quality. At this time i felt the threads and they are very smooth with no rough marks. I tested the 1/2x28 threads with my AAC Ti-Rant 9 and it fit perfectly and snug on the 1/2x28 threads. I then checked my Bowers Group CAC Suppressor on the barrels other threads, the 3/4x10 threads and they fit tight and smooth as well. It truly is one of the best threaded barrels I own. I can honestly its just as good if not better that some of my several hundred dollar Jarvis Barrels I use on my high end pistols. If I'd had known about these sooner, I have no doubt I'd have them on more pistols.

It truly is a GREAT GREAT DEAL !

The 1/2x28 threads are standard on .22 as well as on astandard 9mm barrel so you can thread on suppressors and muzzle brakes. The other thread ¾ X 10 is the standard thread for the M10/9 and M11/9 which will also fit any sub gunsilencer like Gemtechs Viper or Bowers CAC, just to name a few. This Barrel Fits any MAC, M/10, M-11 SMG, Semi Auto and MPA mid sized 9mm."

At right, bevel-cut floral engraving and cinquefoils frame a bounding hare. On the right hand face, the gold details include a rising ring-necked pheasant and a landing mallard duck.
Benelli artisans have chosen AAA-Grade European walnut for the Curator’s stock and fore-end.

A sterling silver medallion is provided with each Curator that can be custom engraved and set into the grip cap. Matched walnut butt plates are standard on each gun. For field use, a fitted rubber recoil pad is included for the 20-gauge as an accessory in each set’s hard case.

Please, please, please read this entire post before deciding to give me a call. This will save both of us some valuable and precious time. 

Well, my wife is pregnant and she is demanding that I minimize my weapons collection. She made an ultimatum and is forcing me to downsize to just 10 weapons :(

I’ve sold my best guns to friends and relatives and in the next few weeks I’ll be selling some of my other guns here on armslist. First one for sale is my bellowed AR15. I’ll give you short back-story to this gun. After I left Army I went overseas to work as private contractor. I purchased this gun from another contractor who came back from Iraq after less than 30 days in country (guess he couldn’t handle the stress). Unfortunately he thought it would be cool to spray-paint his upper receiver.  My best guess is that he was all about looking cool. Personally, I respect my weapons better than that. I believe that lower is built by Superior Arms and upper I believe is built by Rock Rock River Arms (though I am not 100% sure). He put on some special barrel and cheap $200 red-dot scope. Weapon has custom grip, forward handle, rail system and backup site; all manufactured by MagPool. In addition to before mentioned items this rifle will be sold with additional run-of-a-mill handle, new set of grips, original handle, one three point-sling and one single-point tactical sling (my favorite) and 6 different magazines. This rifle will also be sold with soft carrying case and top of the line Pelican Hard case with wheels. 

If you purchased this rifle and put together all this stuff it would cost you around $2000.00 
Majority of items listed above are used but in very-good condition. I am a firm believer that if you take care of your equipment it will take care of you. Person I purchased this rifle from had put less than 50 rounds through this rifle (probably to zero in his red-dot sight) and I estimate that between target practice and actual use I have less than 500 rounds through this rifle. Again, this rifle is in very good shape. If I didn’t love my wife as much as I do I would keep it. 

Item is listed at $1300 and the price is not negotiable. I would love nothing more than to say to my wife “sorry babe, I just couldn’t sell it for what it’s worth”.

Except for the DD Lower Parts Kit, parts were taken off of a BNIB, never-fired S&W M&P 15 MOE Magpul 811053.

Basically I kept the lower receiver and parts kit and replaced the upper receiver and furniture.

- ""MP"" Stamped Bolt carrier group + charging handle (unfired) $150

- $500 S&W Upper Receiver (minus bolt carrier group) from Magpul S&W (includes rear MBUIS, MOE grip, Fixed Front site and compensator/flash hider.)

I also have a brand new in bag Daniel Defense Lower Parts Kit purchased from MidWay for $102 (shipped w/ receipt) that I planned on using to upgrade my lower with, but will also let it go for $80

Take all of the above ($150 + $500 + $80) and I will take off $50 and throw in the stock, pistol grip, forward grip, buffer assembly and action spring and you basically have a complete (never fired) AR15 minus a stripped lower receiver for $660 (would also need a new castle nut and receiver end plate for a total of about $10.)

This combination would allow the most effective use of the iron sights for a carbine with such a short barrel, and may be preferred if the carbine is going to be used primarily with iron sights. Similar modifications have been accomplished in the past by other manufacturers and by depot-level modification, but these earlier conversions sometimes suffered from reliability problems due to the close proximity of the gas port to the muzzle, which throws the timing of the weapon's gas system off and makes it especially sensitive to gas port diameter and port pressure variables introduced by the ammunition. Bushmaster's solution was to use the front sight tower/gas block in its regular, long sight radius position as for the M16, and then fit a second, ""shaved"" gas block at the normal position for the carbine-length barrels such as the M4 or CAR-15. This second gas block is completely covered by the standard full-length M16A2 handguards, which may be used without further modification."

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M2features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches

Info about the rifles:
The Steyr-Mannlicher M1895 rifle is a bolt-action rifle, designed by Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher that used a refined version of his revolutionary straight-pull action. It was nicknamed the ""Ruck-Zuck"" (""right now"" or ""very quick"") by Landsers (German slang for ""troops""). It was initially adopted and employed by the Austro-Hungarian army throughout World War I, and retained post-war by both the Austrian and Hungarian armies. The main foreign user was Bulgaria, which, starting in 1903, acquired large numbers and continued using them throughout both world wars. Numbers of these rifles also saw use in World War II, particularly by second line, reservist, and partisan units in Romania, Yugoslavia, Italy and to lesser degree, Germany. Post war many were sold as cheap surplus, with some finding their way to the hands of African guerrillas in the 1970s, and many more being exported to the US as sporting and collectible arms.
The M1895 is unusual in employing a straight-pull bolt action, as opposed to the more common rotating bolt-handle of other rifles. It consequently renowned for combining a high rate of fire (around 35 rounds per minute) with reliability and sturdiness, although this requires decent care and maintenance with an extractor that is vulnerable to breakage due to a lack of primary extraction. The weapon was issued with a ten-inch blade knife bayonet that was unusual in that the edge faced upwards when mounted on the rifle.
The M1895 was originally chambered in the 8×50mmR Mannlicher cartridge. Between the World Wars, both Austria and Hungary converted the majority of their rifles to fire the more powerful 8×56mmR round. Greece[2] and Yugoslavia[3] converted at least some of their captured M1895s to 7.92×57mm Mauser, fed by stripper clips instead of the original model's en bloc clip system. This conversion was designated M95/24 in Greece and M95M in Yugoslavia. The M95/24 is often mistakenly attributed to Bulgaria, but 8x57mm IS was never a standard caliber of the Bulgarian military.[4] These conversions are prized by collectors for their relative scarcity and chambering in a commonly available round, but suffer from a fragile extractor and a lack of replacement parts.
The M1895 bolt also served as an almost exact template for the ill-fated Canadian M1905 Ross rifle, though the later M1910 used a complicated interrupted-thread instead of two solid lugs.

This rifle does not have the bayonet but does come with 2 clips and 42 rounds of ammo. the clips are like the garand and stay in the rifle while loaded and eject as they empty making a ""ping"" sound. Its an awesome collection piece and is numbers matching. Its in almost new shape should with a great looking darkish red color wood. Should be a great shot! Would be great for hunting or rec use. Its a 8mmx56r which is equivalent to around a .338 caliber.  The ammo can be found online easily and is about 1.00 a round like most hunting ammo. These rifles were cheap until recent years when they became hard to find online for sale and have started sky rocketing in value. I am selling this for christmas money but I am not in a hurry to part with it. Price is pretty firm, can have more pictures via text at REDACTED. Text with any questions if interested."
