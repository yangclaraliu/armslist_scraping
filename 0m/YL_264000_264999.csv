We're not a regular business. We don't have a storefront. We're just two old guys that sell shotgun parts on the weekends at gun shows. We both hold regular full-time jobs too. To atempt to keep up with demand we also BUY shotgun parts, pieces, stocks & foreends. We'll buy junker pump &* auto shotguns just to get the parts. Why, we've bought four gunsmith's estates for its parts. BTW-we're in our 70s and don't do text.

Have for sale a Colt 1911 made in 1970.  Highly collectable as 1970 was a split year of production because the redesigned Series 70 Mark IV 1911 came out mid year.  There were only around 5000 guns made this year and this is one of them, with Nickel plating being a small portion of the production run.  

This is a very clean gun.  There is some wear to the high points, slide edge on one side shows a little.  However, it is not very eye distracting.  You will have to look at it yourself as everyone is different.  Take a look at the pictures and if you have interest, email me.  The red on the picture, I deleted out the serial number but assure you it is 1st year and you can see upon inspection."

In order to determine value the condition of the firearm has to be known. My guess, though, is that unless it is in very good condition the value is such that it would best be used as a decoration in the den.

170,http://www.armslist.com/posts/264170,For Sale:  Model 1816 Eli Whitney 1834  (Musket Has Been Cut Down),"Southport, Wilmington, North Carolina",$ 400,"Listed On: Saturday, December 31, 2011",Muzzle,no type,no type,no type,Muzzle Loader,"This musket started its life as a US model 1816, 69 caliber smoothbore flintlock  musket. The Whitneyville Armory was awarded two contracts to produce these muskets between 1822 and 1841. Some collectors call it the Whitney model 1822, as it had some slight improvements over the standard 1816 model. Other then some early muskets having a ""browned"" barrel, I could never figure out just what else was different. The 1834 date on the lock plate is the year it was made. It is the second of the three types of lock plates used.

This musket  has been converted to percussion, probably in the 1840s or 50s, by what is called the ""Belgian Alteration"". The brass part you see on the lock, is what remains of the flash pan. The NG and 50 on the butt plate  May be a unit marking, as many of the model 1816s were given to the states as militia allotments. The initials JM on the barrel are credited to Justin Murphy, an inspector at the armory. Many of these muskets saw service in the early days of the civil war.

 At sometime, someone cut about a foot off the end of your barrel. It should be 42 inches long and have three bands holding it to the stock. After the civil war, all muzzle loaded firearms became obsolete, and there was thousands of them to be had. Many, were sold as cheap shotguns, and to make them easier to handle in the field, were shortened. Some were shortened by gunsmiths, and are nicely done, some were just sawed off. I actually saw one that was cut using a pipe cutter. It would be nice if it was not cut, it would be great if it was still an original flintlock. But all this is part of your muskets history, and our country's history as well. I'll bet there are not to many things you can buy today that will still be here in 175 years.

It has a 5” octagon barrel and a spur trigger. It is referred to as a model Number 2 old model revolver and also the model number 2 Army. This is because earlier issues of this gun were used extensively as a personal side arm by officers and enlisted men during the Civil War. This gun has a blue finished and shows wear. However, the overall condition is very good and it functions very well. The grips are varnish rosewood with a square butt profile. The grips have an ""x"" notched into it on one side, possibly a marking from a kill in the war? A total of 77,155 of these were manufactured from 1861 to 1874. As a history note, General George Armstrong Custer was known to own a pair of these and ‘Wild Bill” Hitchcock, while Marshall of deadwood was carrying a model Army number 2 the night he was shot holding aces and eights in August of 1874

Banner 6-18X50 Black Matte Description 

The Banner riflescope is designed from maximizing Dusk & Dawn brightness so that you can get the most out of your hunting day.
With the super-high-power, the Bushnell banner 716185 gives you high-performance and great reliability. The multi-coated lenses of this Bushnell rifle scope give you superior clarity and brightness. The field of view of 17/5.7 to 6/2 at 1000 yards in this Bushnell scope allows you to view and target your object accurately. You can conveniently position to see your target with the eye relief of 3.5-inch in this Bushnell rifle scope. The Bushnell banner 716185 has a 1/4 M.O.A. fingertip that lets you adjust the exposure of wind and elevation. The Bushnell banner 716185 is completely shock-resistant, fog-resistant and water-resistant. The magnification of 6X to 18X in this Bushnell scope gives you a detailed and clear view of your target.
Bushnell Banner Rifle Scopes feature Dusk and Dawn Brightness lenses for clarity in low light so you can get the most out of your hunting day.

 I see more dear in the low-light hours than any other time. That said, it's wise to have a scope designed to excel in early-morning and late-evening light. Featuring Dusk & Dawn Brightness (DDB) multi-coated lenses for clarity and brightness in low light, you'll add precious minutes to every hunting day with the Banner Dusk & Dawn series. With one-piece tube design, the Banner Dusk & Dawn line includes a full assortment of specialty scopes for big-game, varmint, .22 rim fire, slug, black powder and turkey hunting. Also great on air guns

I've had it on my rifle for about two years now and love it but it's time to move on.  Comes with mount and removeable flash hider (no box or paperwork).  I traded a 1911 and some cash at a gun show a while back when I lived in Texas thats why I have no packaging or anything.  Like I said it does show signs of wear and is priced accordingly but it still shoots amazing!  Open to POSSIBLE trades. Maybe a glock 26 and some cash, or if you're crazy enough I'll trade you straight up for an M1A since thats what the money is probably going to anyway.  It's a real military grade A.C.O.G. and not some cheap knockoff.  If you can find one anywhere cheaper than this BUY IT!!! You will love shooting through this glass!

The MEC 650 gives maximum performance with a minimum of effort. It works on six shells at once. With every stroke, a reloaded shell is completed.  The MEC 650 has three crimping stations.

The Automatic Primer feed is standard. Fill with a full box of primers and the MEC 650 does the rest.

This is a great scope and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  I have used it for (1) season for long shots across open fields.  The mil-dots have been a great advantage for hold-over indicators.  Put it this way, on my .308 Winchester scoped in at 100yd, I felt comfortable with 300yd shots.  With a simple ballistic calculator (I use Hornaday), I calculated 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 yard MOA hold-overs for the specific bullet weight and ballistic coefficient.  I can help with this if you want me to.  The glass is super clear, turrets with 1/4"" increments at 100yd, and with 12x magnification, I could count whiskers on the whitetails.


Typically the Nikon ProStaff has the standard duplex or BDC reticle.  I thought of getting the BDC reticle which has a generic hold-over indicator for multiple rifles but I wanted a more precise calculation and therefore, better tool to use in the field.  I purchased this scope for $175 plus $10 shipping.  Willing to sacrifice for $150 firm.

Based on the specialized pistols built for a
detachment of United States Marines assigned
to Central Command, the Desert Warrior™ .45
ACP serves equally well for duty and defense.
It is tough, absolutely dependable and very
accurate. Both slide and frame are machined
from solid steel and wear Desert Tan KimPro II®,
a non-reflective finish that is self-lubricating
and extremely resistant to wear, salt and the
elements. The Desert Warrior also has an extended
ambidextrous thumb safety, plus a short (military
length) guide rod for fast takedown. Kimber G-10
grip panels ensure a positive grip regardless of
conditions, and a lanyard ring offers additional
retention options. Standard Kimber features like
match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel
bushing ensure unequaled accuracy. Warrior
pistols include a 7-round magazine with extended
bumper for fast, positive loading, as well as an
extended ambidextrous thumb safety that allows
fast operation with either hand. The best pistol to
carry is a 1911, and the best 1911 is a Kimber.

Features:

• Integral Kimber Tactical Rail™ for accessory
mounting.

• Premium KimPro II® finish is self-lubricating
and protects against the elements.

• Service Melt™ treatment rounds edges to
prevent snags on clothing or holsters.

• Bumped and grooved beavertail grip safety
encourages proper grip position.

This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. I have much more invested in this weapon than my asking price. 

Drum is an extra $50 which is a steal because its new and cost me $100."

Read the reviews on this pistol, it's compared to Sigs but at a lower price point. It's very accurate, reliable and completely rebuildable making for indefinite service life, and has front accessory rail. There's a small amount of wear on left side of rear sight from carrying and a small shallow scratch at the ejection port. Both are shown in the photos. I'd accept reasonable offers, but I'm not in a hurry to sell so I'll hold out for this price for a while."

This is a clone of an M16 but in .22 long rifle. Just like a .223 but far cheaper ammo.
I tried to take the best pictures I could to show the details. It is used but in good condition, there are a couple rub marks here and there. I cannot attest to the round count, my brother owned it. I replaced the main spring so cocks like new again. Kit includes 2 magazines and case. Made in Germany. I am looking to trade.

I’ve been using this for carry, but recently inherited another j-frame. I dislike maintaining lots of firearms, so one of them has to go, and I always base these decisions on sentimental value. Revolver shoots fine and is accurate with effort and practice. As it has been carried a lot it does have some minor cosmetic blemishes (i.e. scratches), but it is otherwise like-new.

at a cool price of 320.00 per barrel I passed. The Browning IMHO is 98+% as

deep blue. Both Barrels Bores are bright and shiny. Barrels are both Vent Rib

Invector Choke System and 3 chokes: IMP CYL, MOD, FULL. This weapon would
make an awesome trap gun, not to mention an all around field gun. The
Barrel with the Invector Choke System is NEW, and I ask that you be realistic
in your offers. The Browning BPS alone with 1 Barrel in this condition are
going for 500.00-600.00, barrels alone with all 3 original chokes are 250.00+.

I will share some humorous observations 
1. You gotta love how certain guns are always and I mean always on the first or second page . This means they are playing with multiple emails. Which means they buy guns from you and me , part them out and sell for profit 
2 . I dont know about you I always feel good about somebody that wants to trade an AR for another one - which screams mine is a pile of crap but I want a decent AR ---or I bought this one with lots of extras which I will keep and just sell the rifle after I have taken every extra that I can sell off of it ____o
3 Be aware of ""custom"" built rifles many people just buying stripped lowers and slapping together the cheapest components (cerro forge, ??) and a cheap scope to sell for $$$
You don't know if they have put it together correctly , and  mixing components can work out ok but it can also be bad ...VERY BAD--- 

///////buyer beware you may end with a good deal , but it may be ....\\\\\
I am sure this wil get flagged but really I'm being helpful for the normal guy and avid shooter 

Oh and you gotta love guys that were buying saiga 12 when they were in short supply and throwing some mods on them then selling for $1000 plus - well hope you like it now that you can google saiga and find them new in the box all day long for $549 and up

PLEASE READ BEFORE CONTACTING ME:

Any pistol offered for consideration MUST be in excellent to new in appearance. Low round count preferred, but not a deal breaker, if it has been well maintained/cared for. I'm very anal retentive regarding cosmetic appearance. If your offered firearm has imperfections, or light scratches, just be honest about them. I may still be interested if it can be repaired/restored. Of course, your asking price will reflect these imperfections, also. Additionally, all offerings MUST be in original manufactures specifications, I am not interested in modified guns unless they have been UPGRADED by a qualified gunsmith and you have verifiable documentation as proof. 

Offerings MUST include original factory case serialized to the gun, paper work & ALL accessories, ALL OF IT. No consideration will be given to any firearm that is not accompanied by these items unless you are selling at a bargain basement price. Asking $25.00 less than new value is NOT bargain basement pricing.

I am located in Illi-Nazi, 3 miles east of the Gateway Arch. I prefer a FTF deal with someone within a 75 mile radius, in my state, but I do have an FFL that is licensed in both MO & IL that will assist in transfers if needed. If you are close to my location and in MO, we can meet at the FFL, for a FTF transaction. I will, of course, pay all transfer fees to my FFL. If we come to terms on a purchase and you are not in a reasonable proximity to my location, and the transaction requires shipping, I will only pay you the agreed upon price of the pistol, and actual shipping costs.  

I will not buy any firearm from anyone who is not legally able to sell said firearm. All required documentation will be drawn and gun laws regarding firearm sales will be strictly adhered to. I am 21 years of age, or older. I have a valid FOID, and a valid a CCW permit from the state of Utah, please don't ask me to jeopardize my right to own a firearm by breaking the law for you.

This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. I have much more invested in this weapon than my asking price. 

Drum is an extra $50 which is a steal because its new and cost me $100.

Don't need a scope, have a few that aren't being used if I go that way..

On the other hand, I have several boxes of .17 HMR ammo that I'd be willing to sell/trade, if I can't find a rifle.. so if you're thinking ""Nah, I'm not selling my rifle, but I sure could use some ammo!"" shoot me an email - I'd sell it or trade for ammo that fits something I still have..

SPS Varmint 223. I bought this 8 months ago and only fired 50 target rounds through it. Like new condition. It was designed for varmint hunting and has the low glare bluing .
It has the heavy target/bull barrel and is very accurate. Adjustable trigger also. I am only selling it so I can get a  deer rifle.

Details below:
Manufacturer: Remington 

The Model 700 SPS Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it is built on the Model 700 action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence is available in left hand models. Its heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity calibers. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation. And sharp predator eyes won't spot the tough, non-reflective matte blued finish on the barrel and receiver. Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver.

I have one fired one Pmag full of 55gr through this weapon since new. The rifle alone is over $1400.00. This is not your typical M4, but a superior Colt match target which means better quality parts straight from assembly like heavier barrel, Factory Muzzle Brake, better fore grips. 

Now for the best part. This rife has several hundred dollars in MAGPUL items like CTR buttstock, Trigger guard, Single point Sling, 3 Brand new P-Mags with Ranger tabs.

On top of the flat picatinny rail is a brand new BSA sweet 223 6-18x tactical rifle scope. This scope is pre-caibrated for the 3 most common grain bullets used in M4's (50, 55, 62) It is set up right now and dialed in with 55 grain turret on the scope. 

Everything goes into a used but excellent condition Pelican full size case. The case alone would cost you over 200 dollars at any outdoors store. it is water proof and airplane legal. 

I hope this description makes it a littel easier to understand why Colt tactical rifles are not the most expensive but easily not dime a dozen either.

Model # is E2022-40-BSS

 It comes with 3 mags that all accept 40 and 357 sig ammo, an extra backstrap, siglite night sights, case, lock, user manual etc. I put less than 150 rounds down the pipe on this gun and cleaned it immediately after firing it. The gun is extremely clean and it's accuracy will surprise you.

 I have $800 invested with the extra mags and barrel, sig only gives 1 mag with the 2022.

Gun was $489

357 Barrel was $180

Extra mags were $80

 This gun shoots very well in either single action or double action. I would bet a box of ammo that it is just as accurate as a p226 or p229. This gun is a tack driver and it also has a decocker.

977,http://www.armslist.com/posts/264977,For Sale:  Smith & Wesson  .270  rifle,"High Ridge, St. Louis, Missouri",$ 300,"Listed On: Sunday, January 1, 2012",Rifles,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,270 Winchester                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Up for sale is my S&W I-BOLT in a .270 Win  for $300.00  without scope or ammo. or $340.00 with almost 2 full boxes (39 rounds) of Winchester .270 ammo. It has a blued barrel with black synthetic stock
This gun is in great condition. The only cosmetic flaw I can find is a small scratch on the buttstock where it looks like It was scratched from a tree limb from walking through the woods. It has been my main deer rifle the last 3 seasons and I put one full box + 1 round through it between sighting in and deer hunting the past 3 seasons and I have 
meticulously cleaned it after each shooting session or a day of hunting. The bore on it is still perfect and I had the bolt polished so the action is super smooth. This gun doesn't come with scope, as I am using it on my 22-250 now.
   These S&W I-BOLTS's are described as being ""a properly dressed 8 point"" because they have many featues such as a 60 degree bolt lift which won't hit low mounted scopes, 3 position safety, recoil reduction chamber in buttstock, uni directional checkering, e-z turn bolt release, x-bed stock design in the forend, flush sling mounts, a 23 inch Thompson/Center match grade precision Barrel that is 90* target crowned, a Timney style adjustable ""Tru-Set"" Trigger thats adjustable from 3-6 Lbs. Externally , and it has a built in one piece Weaver scope mount.

Now, I dont want to run off potential buyers but I will say low ball offers or flea market negoiating tactics will not go over  with me. PLease don't not insult me by  ""swinging by to take a look"" and If you even show up with sudden disregard to the price by saying "" I only brought ""X"" amount of money  or something similiar, then it will be no deal and goodbye. This gun is reasonalbly priced and you can goto GunBroker or Guns America and do some research.  One would be hard pressed to find a rifle this nice and with this many features for only 300 bucks.
I hate to be this way but Armslist is turning in Craigslist and thats not good.

Also, I am willing to ship this rifle  to your chosen FFL only with pre-payment in a United Stated Postal money order only plus $25.00 for shipping and insurance with tracking. If your chosen FFL dealer requires shipment from an FFL to a FFL (which is not a law by the way) then  it will be an additional $25.00 on top of that which is what my FFL dealer charges.
I plan on leaving this ad up for about a week more and if it hasnt sold by then Im going to auction it off on Gunbroker.com

The pistol, scope, and bipod together weigh about 6 ½ pounds.

This firearm is capable of routinely shooting sub-moa 5-shot groups with the proper handloads.  The muzzle velocity is around 3000 fps with 50-grain loads and around 3200 fps with 40grain loads (chronographed).
