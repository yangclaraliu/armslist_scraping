with a raised Trillion Cut( http://www.diamondsonweb.com/information/trillion-cut-diamonds.mhtml ) Center stone .4 Carats. Can you say big?
All stones are eye clean and I was unable to see inclusions with a 10X jewelers loop. Not a professional so I won't try and tell you the actual clarity measurements. Center stone is complimented by 7 .085 carat (approx) diamonds in channel setting positioned with the corners up and down so they all touch corners in a a line. There is even a diamond under the main stone that increases the incredible fire the main stone already has. Ring comes with a Lifetime Rhodium plating and diamond warranty from Kay Jewelers. This is very useful being that a rhodium dip is around $30 right now and the average ring needs dipped every 6 months of wear to keep the luster. That alone saves you $60 a year that is $600 in ten years!!! This ring was a limited production ""showcase ring"" very few of these were made by Kay Jewelers, very hard to find another like it. Would hold onto it but my wife wants to take up shooting as a hobby so we are looking to get some start up cash to do so. If you want to see the ring we can meet at Kays in the mall or another similar neutral place. More pics available.

USP .40 Compact. Bought in 2009, less than 1000 rounds put through it. Case, manual, 2 magazines, and 100 rounds to go with it.

I want to sell this by the weekend. I will take absolutely no less than $400 and I absolutely will not trade for anything. I'm going to dump the money I make off of this into my hobbies. Protip: motorcycle racing is expensive.

If you are one of the people who emailed me way back when I had this listed before, I'm sorry, some jerk strung me along and then bailed and it kind of soured the whole experience for me.

This is a really nice handgun and it's a lot of fun, its small size and stopping power means it would make a great CCW (which is why I bought it in the first place.) Don't really want to see it go but I gotta sell something!

My first trip to the range and the gun has hammer follow and double fires.  I believe the problem lies in the sear and hammer engagement (it's not as simple as a sear spring).  All internal parts appear to be original, the slide to frame fit is tight, the barrel is in good shape, the plunger tube is tight as well.  The gun is in really good shape except for a slight mar near the slide release (newbie field strip mistake) and the mag release is a little scratched on the ejection port side.  The gun comes with 2 Kimber 7 rd. mags, bushing wrench, and a brand new Kimber steel mainspring housing that I bought and never installed.

side rail on receiver which can accept mounts for red-dot or other sights. it has one 5 round clip.

The Saiga-20 autoloading shotgun is designed for professional and sport hunting small and medium-sized game under different climatic conditions. The shotgun is equpped with a 20-ga barrel with chamber, providing for shooting shot or slugs, including Magnum, with a shotshell length of 2 3/4"" and 3"". The shotgun demonstrates high reliability and withstands the harshest hunting conditions. The shotgun is capable of delivering single-shot fire and is reloaded automatically due to the energy of the powder gasses, escaping from the barrel bore to the gas cylinder and the energy of the return spring as well.
This Izhmash/Russian American Armory SAIGA 20 is a semi auto shotgun that fires the .20 gauge shell. It has a 19” barrel with a matte black finish. The shotgun comes with a 5 round magazine, side receiver scope rail and the adjustable sight leaf. 
Saiga 20 shotguns are developed along with similar 12 gauge and 410 gauge shotguns, all based on the time-proven Kalashnikov AK assaultrifle design. 
Saiga20 shotguns are gas-operated, semi-automatic weapons that uselong-stroke gas piston located above the barrel. Gas system is fitted with two-position manual gas regulator, to provide reliable functioning with standard (70mm) or magnum (76mm) ammunition. Barrel is locked by rotary bolt. Barrel bore and action are chromed to provide better corrosion resistance. Barrels can be fitted with optional interchangeable chokes. Feed is from detachable box magazines, holding 2, 5 or 8 rounds."

This is a used Kimber .45ACP, 5"" barrel, with the traditional internal extractor, meprolight nite sights (a call to Kimber indicated that this gun was made in July 2008).  I am the second owner of this pistol-I purchased it from another guy here on Armslist.

My first trip to the range and the gun has hammer follow and double fires.  I believe the problem lies in the sear and hammer engagement (it's not as simple as a sear spring).  All internal parts appear to be original, the slide to frame fit is tight, the barrel is in good shape, the plunger tube is tight as well.  The gun is in really good shape except for a slight mar near the slide release (newbie field strip mistake) and the mag release is a little scratched on the ejection port side.  The gun comes with 2 Kimber 7 rd. mags, bushing wrench, and a brand new Kimber steel mainspring housing that I bought and never installed.

Just to eliminate any liability on my end (do to the double firing-""full auto"" effect), I am selling this gun without the firing pin-making it 100% inoperable.

This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. 
Features: 
** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish. 
** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. 
** Hogue® Tamer grip helps reduce perceived recoil.

FFP Brief Introduction: Most scopes have the reticle fitted in the second focal plane (near the eyepiece). While, presently it has always been the practice to fit the reticle in the first focal plane (the reticle increases its size when change the magnification from low to high). Each system has its advantages.

The advantage with telemetric reticles (like rangefinder & Mil-dot etc) is that the target image and distance between dots remains constant even when changing magnification. It is the system that is widely used by the TOP military suppliers now.

The pistols come with one magazine a peice and one cleaning rod a peice(I do not have the holsters)
The ammo for these pistols is EXTREMELY cheap... But I do have some ammo I paid a premium price for- it is 238 rds of Polish ammo on stipper clips ... I will also include about another 140 rounds of some unknown manufacture ammo that is not on stripper clips.
I have tried to find polish ammo on stipper clips- I can't find any.

I will divide the package but it will be more expensive, 350 apeice for the CZ 52 and I will sell the ammo separately for $45

The whole package is available for $650. PRICES ARE FIRM

Just FYI- I am a law enforcement officer that is VERY Pro-Second Amendment, however I also have bit of a built in scumbag detector in my head- If I even suspect that you are a Drug Dealer, Gang Member, or some other type of individual that law abiding people should be arming themselves against, then the deal is off and I walk away with my weapons.

I am only selling because eye surgery has left my eyes unable to focus well on the Aimpoint dot. The same deal sells for $645 shipped from Larue. I am asking $600 firm. I still have the invoice dated in FEB. This optic has only been used a handful of times. No marks whatsoever. The glass and coatings are clean and crisp with no scratches. The switch has been kept on the 0 setting, so you should get about 5 years of battery life. Comes complete with the manual, Larue wrench, bag from Larue, and Aimpoint lens cover. The mount is the quick detachable variety and sets the optic at proper SOCOM lower 1/3rd witness. The T1 is Night Vision compatible.

T1 Specs:
Micro - T-1, 4 MOA, Night Vision CompatibleManufacture ID: 11830In response to the need for smaller and lighter tactical sights, Aimpoint is proud to introduce the new Micro T-1 electronic red-dot sight. Built to offer the same battleproven ruggedness as larger Aimpoint sights, the Micro T-1 is able to perform under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon. This new compact sight is suitable for use on rifles, carbines, shotguns, submachineguns and handguns. The Aimpoint Micro T-1 is ideal as a stand-alone sight, and can also be piggybacked on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics. The Micro T-1 weighs in at only 3.6 ounces, and comes complete with a patent-pending integral Picatinny mount that is keyed into the sight body to absorb recoil. The Micro T-1 is a 1X (non magnifying) parallax-free optic that features a 4 minute of angle (MOA) red dot for fast target acquisition. No tools are required to zero the sight, as the top of the caps covering the windage and elevation screws fit directly into holes on the adjustment screws to make the adjustment. The Micro T-1 is waterproof to 25 meters (80 feet) and tough enough to stand up to the worst field conditions. Optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices, the Micro T-1 features a manual adjustment switch with 6 night vision compatible settings and 7 daylight settings (including one extra bright setting for use in desert sunlight or with laser protection filters). Aimpoint s state-of-the-art ACET diode technology allows the Micro T-1 to operate continuously for over 5 years on a single CR-2032 battery."

The firearm is chambered to fire 9 mm Luger Parabellum ammunition. While a true double-action pistol, the firearm shares the magazine disconnect feature with Browning Hi-Power pistols: it cannot be fired without the magazine in place.

Other features include ambidextrous safety levers, a one-piece rear wraparound grip, and  fixed sights"

I know $1300 is expensive, but check out the gas piston AR's online they average about $1600, if they have them in stock, and many of them are even higher than that. Many are going for over $2000. This is NOT a conversion gas piston. It is a true gas piston AR15.

TRADES- I am looking for handguns in trade. Trades in the range of about $1200 to $1300. I will take one handgun plus cash to make up the difference in value, or two handguns also if they are in the dollar range shown above. If you have something that you think I might be interested in, but doesn't reach the dollar amount, just let me know. Maybe we can work something out. Special interest in compact 1911's, compact or subcompact Glocks, compact M&P 9 or 40, Sig P238, Kahr CM9, Diamondback 380.

I use the Blue Book Value of Guns to determine your guns worth. I will usually give 100% value unless something major is wrong with the gun. I am not going to be critical over a little scratch or light holster wear. I can go above book value too. If I am really interested in the gun (like the guns listed above). 

This is the last run for this AR, if no deal is made it will return to the safe. Don't miss the chance to own a gas piston AR for cheap."

Have this scope sitting around. Have not used it but it is mounted in an AIMPOINT QRP for easy removal and install. 

I have not fired a rifle with this scope on it but I do have several IOR scopes and I have found them all to be excellent. IORs are considered a high end scope and this one is no exception.

Price = $199.00. Heck of a bargain the AIMPOINT mount is about $100 dollars by itself."

AAC - Ti-Rant

The Ti-RANT is the next chapter in ultra-high-performance 9mm handgun sound and flash suppression. Careful material selection has made it possible to design a 9mm silencer that delivers class defining performance in a light-weight package that does not have an adverse effect on the balance and handling traits of the host pistol. The Ti-RANT is designed around a new generation of A.S.A.P. System (Assured Semi Automatic Performance). The fully integrated A.S.A.P. System facilitates flawless semi-automatic operation on all popular 9mm sidearms and can be quickly and easily disassembled for service by the end-user without the use of tools.
Constructed of Grade 9 Titanium, heat treated 17-4 PH stainless steel, and high strength hard coat anodized 7075-T6 aluminum alloy, the Ti-RANT re-writes the book on 9mm silencer efficiency and long-term durability.

The model 311 started as the Springfield ""5000"" around 1920 with the model designation changing to ""5100"" in 1931.Around 1941 it became the Stevens model 311.It was discontinued in 1989  Double barrels were ""modified"" on the right barrel, and ""full choke"" on the left side. Up untill 1968 they did not have serial numbers as it wasnt required.Post march 1949 models had date codes stamped between the trigger and barrel hinge pin.In1931 they were marked ""5100"", around 1941 they were marked as ""model 311"" .This one has both markings suggesting very early 40's mfg. maybe.This one has an ""A"" inside a circle,under the barrels on the receiver which would seem to be a ""1949"" model, but from what i've read on these the ""5100"" marking wasnt used affter the early 40's.

This has been carried far more than shot. I would estimate about 200 - 250 rounds through it. Show signs of wear on slide, frame, and sights from carry but nothing major just finish wearing a little. This is a hoss of a little compact.  S&W used the .45 frame for this model so its made to withstand extreme duty. The barrel, action, rails, are perfect. The DO makes this a little more safe as it requires a full trigger pull ( very good for home safety ) but the trigger pull is very very smoth and never affected my accuracy. Has the Hogue rubber wrap around grip w/ finger grooves. Novak trijicon night sights have green tritium front and rear. 500.00 cash OBO. Email me for more pics of the internals if needed. Might consider trade so just let me know"
