A2 Flash hider

Rifle is a 1900 dollars, very fair for a Bushmaster with all options and ammo.
Custom AR pistol is 1600 dollars, once again if you can find one cheaper...good luck.
If you buy both price is 3300 dollars, and that includes 720 tracer rounds.

This shotgun, developed in the late 1980s or early 1990s by the famous Italian arms manufacturing company Pietro Beretta, is, basically, an upgrade over the preceding model, Beretta 1200. The 1201 was manufactured in two versions, 1201F,intended for hunting and sporting, and the 1201FP, intended for police and other such duties. Interestingly enough, the 1201 is extremely similar to the BenelliM1 Super 90 shotgun, and had the same recoil-operated semiautomatic action,developed and patented by Benelli. The production of the Beretta 1201 shotguns had been completed.

Since the basic action of the 1201 is similar to such of the Benelli M1 shotgun,for the technical description please refer to the appropriate article at this site. The 1201FP was available with polymer furniture and stock, either with classic or pistol grip. Since the recoil spring is located in the buttstock,this shotgun cannot be fitted with the folding buttstock. The 1201FP can be found with either ghost-ring (large aperture diopter) or open rifle-type rearsights, and with the blade front sight."

I am not interested in selling, only trading for a 9mm AR. I'd prefer a non dedicated lower, but would consider a dedicated lower if the gun is right. I can add cash or other items on my end for the right deal. I am not interested in JRC or High Point rifles.

Thanks for looking."

This is a brand new in box Bushmaster AR 15 M4-A3 Patrolman with the factory installed Yankee Hill quad rail. Rifle has never been fired and comes to you as it would from the factory with all paperwork, sling, and Bushmaster 30 round magazine. MSRP on this rifle is $1390 as you will see on Bushmaster's website. I paid nearly this much well before the demand started last month.  This is not a cheap DPMS or no-name brand that cost $700 from Wal-Mart... I am firm on my price but will consider trades. I am interested in nicer 1911's or 308 (7.62x51) rifles which I can add cash if needed. Must be an Ohio resident with no felonies and you must be able to legally possess. I prefer to meet FTF to complete sale or I will ship out of state to a FFL holder only. If you have any questions, please ask, but do not email me if you are not interested in purchasing or trading for this weapon at my asking price. 
From Bushmaster:
MSRP - $1,391.48

Comes with 1 -35 rd mag, metal folding stock, remove able muzzle break, threaded barrel and has a matte black finish.  These guns are far better quality than almost ALL AKs on the market. Thy have tighter tolerances and fitted better.  The Galil is kinda like an Israel AK. 

The Galil is hammer-fired and has a trigger mechanism patterned after the trigger used in the American M1 Garand.[2] 
The Galil prototypes used a stamped and riveted sheet metal steel receiver, but due to the higher operating pressures of the 5.56x45mm cartridge, this solution was discarded and the designers turned to a heavy milled forging. As a testament to its heritage, early prototypes were fabricated using Valmet Rk 62 receivers manufactured in Helsinki.[2] All exterior metal surfaces are phosphated for corrosion resistance and then coated with a black enamel (except for the barrel, gas block and front sight tower).
The weapon is fitted with a high-impact plastic handguard and pistol grip and a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular steel skeleton stock. The rifle can be used with a sound suppressor. The weapon features a bottle opener in the front handguard and wire cutter built into the bipod. The bottle opener feature was included to prevent damage to magazines being used to open bottles, due to the large civilian reservist components of the IDF. Use of magazines to open bottles was a common source of magazine lip damage with Uzi submachine guns. Wire cutters were included to reduce the time necessary for IDF troops to cut down wire fences common to rural areas in Israel.

This buggy will top out at 68 MPH! IT IS FAST! I built the motor mounts, the shifter, welded an amo box in the back (for the battery and the wiring so it can't get wet), and lengthen and reinforced the fame. Key ignition start, 3 point harness, with good brakes, needs new shocks in rear, good clutch, oil recently changed, brand new after market air filters, and good chain. It is OVER built. Very strong chassis. The motor runs great, I took it out of a Honda street bike. The exhaust is loud and sounds amazing! Will turn a lot of heads. Funnest thing I have ever drove! It's not too good in mud but great handling on county roads and pavement, and conquers the trails like a champ and would be great at the sand dunes! I get compliments on it all the time. Im in college and I really just never get the time to ride it but I can go out to the barn right now and it will right up and is ready to go. I have tried to break this thing and could not do it. I am willing to take an offer on it but I would also be willing to trade for guns. (AR-15, pistols, other guns, whatever??). I love to talk about this go-kart because im proud of it so if u want to know any details or anything about this rig let me know and I'll fill u in!

This buggy will top out at 68 MPH! IT IS FAST! I built the motor mounts, the shifter, welded an amo box in the back (for the battery and the wiring so it can't get wet), and lengthen and reinforced the fame. Key ignition start, 3 point harness, with good brakes, needs new shocks in rear, good clutch, oil recently changed, brand new after market air filters, and good chain. It is OVER built. Very strong chassis. The motor runs great, I took it out of a Honda street bike. The exhaust is loud and sounds amazing! Will turn a lot of heads. Funnest thing I have ever drove! It's not too good in mud but great handling on county roads and pavement, and conquers the trails like a champ and would be great at the sand dunes! I get compliments on it all the time. Im in college and I really just never get the time to ride it but I can go out to the barn right now and it will right up and is ready to go. I have tried to break this thing and could not do it. I am willing to take an offer on it but I would also be willing to trade for guns. (AR-15, pistols, other guns, whatever??). I love to talk about this go-kart because im proud of it so if u want to know any details or anything about this rig let me know and I'll fill u in! Let me know what you are willing to offer for it and maybe we can make a deal. Thanks for your time!

Thanks!

I have 31 (thirty one) boxes of Norinco steel core 7.62 x 39 in the yellow boxes.
This was imported during the late 80's and described as armor piercing ammunition. (the yellow box stuff was also packaged in silver boxes, same ammo).
It has copper washed steel casings and the bullets aren't just thin steel jacketed as much of the other Chinese and Russian stuff, but these have STEEL CORES with a copper jacket. 

Oh, it's also NON CORROSIVE, unlike most of the surplus you find nowadays, so you can spend more time shooting and less time cleaning!

I can't vouch for the armor piercing capabilities of this stuff, but it was banned from import back in the 1990's as armor piercing bullets and this was grandfathered in as I already owned it....I can also legally resell it, so there you are!
You won't find new stuff like this and I'll guarantee that. If you want Steel core you will have to buy this type, and if not from me, you WILL Pay more!.

This is going for up to 20 bucks a box on some Aucton sights but I need some money fast so will sell these at $10 per box cash. THAT PRICE IS FIRM AND I WILL NOT TAKE A DIME LESS so don't offer.
HOWEVER, if you take all 31 boxes you get the last one free, as it'll just cost you $300.00 cash. Buy it and resell it....save it for when the SHTF.....

$300.00 cash takes all 31 boxes, and THAT is a heckuva bargain....just look at what this stuff is costing elsewhere! This is the best price on Armslist!!
Sorry but I will NOT ship this anywhere...FTF in Minnesota only.

But buy it quick as it will not last long....and if you ever need some, where else are you gonna find it?

Thanks for looking!"

Everything about this rifle is high quality; even the exquisite blonde forearm furniture, which is very modernistic. I am in the St Petersburg area of Florida and am selling my large collection of firearms including rare semi's from the 50's through Draco and Draco mini's.

Another term that could be used is terrisum. Terrisum is used to put fear into a population to disrupt they natural order of ways we as Americans have become carful. No more different than when a group of hijackers boarded a plain and did the unthinkable and killed thousands, it scared Americans from flying, cost airlines billions and affected or enconomy in a negative way. Now another tragady has accrued and sent Americans into a panic, buying up firearms, people tryin to ban certian types of rifles, and a whole lot of finger pointing. The people who are selling these weapons at rediculious prices you are benifiting from America's fears and are the worst kind of citizen. Instead of profiting from your fellow American ban together as gun owning citizens and make sure we keep the rights we have and so we don't pay 80 bucks for a mag that cost 5 bucks to make.

My rifle:

Ive had this rifle for 2 years, bought it new from Dunhams.  Ive put about 1000 rnds downrange with it and it will shoot 3"" groups at 100 METERS all day if i do my part.  I built this up myself over the last couple years while educating myself on the akm and quality, pro gear for it.  Polished the trigger group and smoothed out the action.  I also have the original wood furniture and rear sight, additional tapco T-6 stock, ak74 muzzle break, buttstock cleaning kit, 10 steel 30 rnd European surplus mags in vg+ condition, 2 Tapco 30 rnd od green mags,  2 twenty round hungarian mags, and 1 five/ten rnd steel mag.  

Its current configuration is:  Texas Weapons System Gen 2 (first run) rail with leaf sight, Midwest Industries od green handguard for Aimpoint T1/H1 micro co-witness,  CNC Warrior Pantom flash hider, Bonesteel left side folding tube , Magpul CTR telescoping stock with 1/2"" riser, Hogue od green grip w/ storage, and Israeli sling with Blue Force Gear sling loop.

Bore is chrome-lined and shiny with deep rifling grooves.  This is a fine rifle and about as far as we have come in terms of updating this to a 21st century combat weapon.  IT WILL NOT FAIL YOU.

===RIFLE DOES NOT COME WITH ANY OPTICS OR LIGHTS===

DESCRIPTION-
Navy Work Uniform (NWU) Gore-Tex® Parka
Genuine US Navy digital Gore-Tex® parka.
Parka is a soft and quiet outerwear garment constructed of strong, durable and water-resistant Gore-Tex® membrane.
Each garment is made in the USA and is windproof, breathable, and has a moisture-wicking barrier for maximum comfort and durability in even the harshest conditions.

NOTE TO MILITARY PERSONNEL: THIS GARMENT HAS NIR TECHNOLOGY AND IS APPROVED FOR MILITARY OPERATIONS

Near Infrared (NIR) Signature Management Technology is used by the U.S. Department of Defense to prevent detection by NIR Image Converters.
These photocathode devices do not detect temperatures, but rather infrared radiation variances.
NIR-compliant uniforms use a special fabric that allows servicemembers to appear at the same radiation level as the surrounding terrain, thus making them more difficult to detect. 

MORE DETAILS-

A composite layer of fabric popular for outdoor clothing and/or accessories. It is often waterproof so perfect for outwears like jackets, shoes, specialty pants (ski pants, hiking pants, etc.), and hats. It is breathable, meaning that the wearer's sweat can evaporate for comfort.

Thus, construction workers, firefighters, and other professionals who are constantly outdoors wear jackets, pants, and protective wear made from Gortex. Not to mention that Gore-Tex jackets are commonly worn by the US Navy during operation because they are constantly facing rain, heavy wind, and the harsh climate of the open seas. Cotton, linen, polyester, and sometimes, leather materials just wouldn't do.

Why wear a Gore Tex jacket?

Since World War II (and even way before that), the United States Navy had become a prevalent military force in multinational combat and had the task of protecting United States shorelines in the Pacific and Atlantic. Bases were definitely set up in other nations and regions which include Wake Islands and the Philippines. The modern Navy carried out assignments around the Atlantic Ocean, at the same time, as Navy vessels and airplanes chased Nazi submarines who were preying on Allied commercial ships. Navy bases had been strategically established in allied North Atlantic regions like Iceland for these assignments.

The Concealable holster is one of Galco's most recognizable and innovative belt holsters. Its unique two piece construction is contoured on the body side to the natural curve of the hip, keeping all the molding on the front of the holster, allowing for significantly more comfortable carry and a narrower profile than an ordinary pancake type holster. Hand molded to fit specific handguns, the Concealable features a deeply hand molded exterior for excellent retention properties and superior appearance, combat grip accessibility for speed, double stitched seams for durability, and covered trigger guard for safety. The Concealable is constructed of premium saddle leather and made to fit belts up to 1 1/2"".
