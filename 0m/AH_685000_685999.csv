It is just collecting dust.  I'm looking to trade.  Ammo .223, 5.56, 7.62x39, .40, 45 acp.  Guns hit me with any offer.

This is a relatively rare rifle made in Soviet arsenals after WW2 by shortening a standard M 1891 long rifle. Very few of these are on the market today.

The rifling also extends all the way to the end of the barrel and IS NOT counter bored like the M44 carbine.

Numbers match. Made from a 1942 dated M91.

I see this sight as a useful tool for a private gun owner to sell his firearm without the need to consign to an ffl dealer, but now all i see are ffl dealers taking advantage of this sight. Your a business so create your own website and sell your product that way. You post these lower prices then when you get a bite you charge taxes and a background check fee. It's BS. At the very least purchase some advertisement from arms list and advertise on this website, instead of expecting everything free. Most FFL dealers get direct shipment from the manufacturer at wholesale prices then take the hot or hard to find firearms and instead of selling in store at msrp prices post them on gunbroker for auction and get double if not triple what they pay for a firearm we can not find. Is that honest business?? At least on here a private seller is free to ask whatever but shouldn't a business be held to a standard. That's my thought. I see a pawn shop on here who gives less than half for a gun and then ask retail. Live Free or DIE ....Don't Tread On ME"

This handsome rimfire rifle sports an AR-style look and is modeled after the legendary original Colt M4. A ""Tactical Rimfire"" rifle, the M4 Ops is an upgraded version of the .22 M4 Carbine. Instead of the standard forearm found on the carbine, the Ops has an RIS, or Rail Interface System, that provides tactical railing on four sides allowing for you to mount a variety of available accessories.

Additionally, the carry handle that's on the carbine is also replaced by a detachable rear sight making the M4 Ops an ideal optic-ready rimfire rifle."

I am selling my AR-15. I am not trying to buy one. Please resist the urge to bombard me with emails telling me where you can find one cheaper. If you can in fact find such good deals, then you should stock up on them. Nothing personal but I have done my homework and know this is a very fair and very reasonable price for this particular gun if you compare apples to apples. If you disagree please shop elsewhere.

Yes there are brand new ARs for less. They are not marked the same.

I do not need a history lesson on AR-15s or what makes one item a collectible over another. A 1965 Mustang is worth more than a new one. It is supply and demand. The bottom line is, Colt stopped manufacturing AR-15s with the ""Restricted"" rollmarks thus those that are marked with such are collectors items. Like it or leave it. If you are looking for a new AR for zombie slaying I recommend Buds Guns or Buds Police Supply if you qualify. (Great prices and service,)

If you are still with me here are a few details. It comes with on 20-round Colt magazine, a Magpul ASAP sling adapter, and a new with tags Colt rifle case.

I will subtract $50 if you do not want the case and sling adapter; and yes my price is firm.

Not looking for any trades unless you want to bring a LWRC to the table (I didn't think so).

Finally, buyer must have NC ID and be able to legally purchase/posses a firearm. (i.e. show Concealed Carry Permit or Pistol Permit or background check) No convicted felons need apply. If this listing is up, I still have the firearm. I will remove the listing as soon as it sells."

It was built on an NDS 1.6mm receiver and has the bulged trunnion. It is not a Century built rifle and it is not a pap converted rifle. Those two versions are being sold today for $629 and up. They are also giving a lot of problems due to poor workmanship and conversions. This is an original military weapon that was rebuilt semi auto with the original barrel. The barrel is not shot out and is in good shape. The date on the barrel trunnion is 1987 and it is finished in battlefield pickup look. Considering what the others mentioned are selling for, this one is priced fair and it's firm. I won't consider taking less. If you don't think the price is fair, then find the same kit online and price it and a new receiver. Then add $200 minimum to have it built. No disrespect intended. I'm just tired of the ones who think they can still buy a real AK for $400. FTF in the Knoxville area only. I'll drive further on your dime. Please bring photo ID and be willing to prove you can legally own a weapon.

I took a Norinco government frame and slide (made from recycled railroad rails, some of the hardest steel in the world), gutted most everything, replaced with Ed Brown internals, and a EGW Trigger group. Had all the work done by Vanguard Custom and then had a hard chrome finish put on it. This thing will group like my Wilson, and could out last any military Colt. I wanted something that would go bang if it was under water, filled with sand, packed with mud, and then just wipe down without chemicals (That wasn't a Glock)...and this is IT.

Trying to buy another firearm.


For those of you that don't know, it's identical to the AR 5.56 version of the M&P, but it's a .22LR caliber.
I've shot probably about 2,000 rounds through the gun and to be honest, I've had one jam. (Double feed)

It is a flat top model AR style gun, made out of complete polymer. Both the upper and lower. If you haven't seen one of these, check it out!
It comes apart just like a regular AR style rifle. The bolt comes out in one motion, just like a regular AR. It's the only .22LR I know that does it.
I've purchased a new stock for the gun. The Magpul MOE milspec stock. Purchased from Cabela's here in Lacey. I have the original stock as well.
I've also purchased an extra magazine for the gun, and a fore-grip for the gun. I also have a bushnell 3x9 magnification scope on it right now.
Cleaned and kept in a soft case after each use. Will sell gun with the soft case. (has 4 magazine pouches)
Also, I've purchased a ambidextrous single point sling attachment. (It wasn't cheap..)

Paid just over $500.00 for the gun, but selling for $600.00 due to all the purchases and upgrades I've made. Willing to sell stock for $500.00.

I have all original parts for the gun.

Everything from Para to Wilson, but this 1911 has got to be the greatest one I've owned. I took a Norinco government frame and slide (made from recycled railroad rails, some of the hardest steel in the world), gutted most everything, replaced with Ed Brown internals, and a EGW Trigger group. Had all the work done by Vanguard Custom and then had a hard chrome finish put on it. This thing will group like my Wilson, and could out last any military Colt. I wanted something that would go bang if it was under water, filled with sand, packed with mud, and then just wipe down without chemicals (That wasn't a Glock)...and this is IT. I've only put about 300rds through it in the time I've had it. It has mainly stayed in the safe. I'm open to trades for other firearms or firearm/optic combos.

Scheels Outfitters Deluxe Tactical Gun Case 

The versatile MSR needs a case as rough and ready as itself.

It's simple ecology. When the number of predators is reduced, there's more deer reaching adulthood, and thus more deer hunting. So I'm doing my part by getting into the coyote hunting action. But in order to transport and store my MSR safely, I've picked up the Scheels Outfitters deluxe tactical gun case. It's not a remake of other cases, but was designed specifically for the needs of the predator hunter.
 Features: •41"" x 12.5"" fully padded case holds scoped guns up to XX"" barrel length plus most customized MSRs with pistol grips, lights and other accessories
 •Zip-open side pocket has four magazine pockets plus a handgun holster
 •Interior has soft liner and adjustable strap system to hold your gun secure
 •Rustproof 2-way heavy-duty zipper
 •Sturdy web handles
 •Padded shoulder straps converts case to backpack style

Gun is new, has less then 200 rounds down the tube and is in perfect condition. Comes with case and all the paperwork it came with when I purchased it. While this is not my duty weapon, it is the same gun I carry and would trust nothing other then it, you want reliability? this is the same gun the Navy Seals  carry. If you have cash I am asking $850 obo, if you want to trade then the value will be a little more as this gun retails around $1200. 
Also, I have one fine AR listed as well, and for the right one I would be willing to trade the Sig and the AR for an M1A.

NO junk, low ball offers, and please only serious inquiries, I don't have time to waste, if the ad is up then it is still available so there is no reason to ask me. Thanks for looking."

Up for sale is a ""Cold Steel"" Artist's Proof co-signed By Col Millett and by Don Stivers.  I'm offering this great Signed and Numbered Limited Edition Print at a very reasonable price. You will not find another one like this ever anywhere. I personally had Colonel Millett sign and date this print in Korea 51 years to the day of the famous action where he earned the Medal of Honor. This print is signed twice by Colonel Millett (once where he co-signed with Stivers in the left margin, and a very bold signature and date on the top-left of the print).

This is an Artists Proof #68 of 95.  I framed and matted this print, and have included two of Colonel Millett's commemorative Medal of Honor coins which he gave me in Korea while I was escorting him at the Hill 180 ceremony, Osan AFB Korea in February 2002. 

Capt. Millett, Company E, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action. While personally leading his company in an attack against a strongly held position he noted that the 1st Platoon was pinned down by small-arms, automatic, and antitank fire. Capt. Millett ordered the 3d Platoon forward, placed himself at the head of the 2 platoons, and, with fixed bayonet, led the assault up the fire-swept hill. In the fierce charge Capt. Millett bayoneted 2 enemy soldiers and boldly continued on, throwing grenades, clubbing and bayoneting the enemy, while urging his men forward by shouting encouragement. Despite vicious opposing fire, the whirlwind hand-to-hand assault carried to the crest of the hill. His dauntless leadership and personal courage so inspired his men that they stormed into the hostile position and used their bayonets with such lethal effect that the enemy fled in wild disorder. During this fierce onslaught Capt. Millett was wounded by grenade fragments but refused evacuation until the objective was taken and firmly secured. The superb leadership, conspicuous courage, and consummate devotion to duty demonstrated by Capt. Millett were directly responsible for the successful accomplishment of a hazardous mission and reflect the highest credit on himself and the heroic traditions of the military service."

photos upon request, wood is good condition with 2 hairline cracks on either side of magazine well (as is common with the thinner wood after magazine conversion in 1878) i have fired around 200 rounds through this rifle and the cracks have not furthered in any way. the most noteworthy stock flaw is a pinky finger sized depression (grain appears not broken, it could be raised) near one of the cracks.

it comes with a repro cleaning rod (crafted by a gentleman named Hank from canada), an original beaumont bayonet in exceptional condition. the repro cleaning rod is about 1/4 inch too long to mount bayonet when the rod is in, so i was planning on just cutting it to length, it does not need to thread into the gun to stay put.

The metal was cleaned at some point by someone, appears to have been quite  awhile ago. not patina brown but not fresh white steel by any means. all parts on this gun are there. includes a swedish mauser sling always treated with mink oil (i like the swedish slings because they are simple, leather slings that are usually well worn and supple, seems like they belong on these antique rifles more than they do the swedish amusers!)

i will include some brass (both 43 beaumont brass, and converted 50-90 sharps i have crafted) and the 8mm lebel lee and 45-70 Lee die sets used to craft ammo from 50-90 cases. this rifle fires standard .457 45-70 bullets, and when filled case capacity with black powder it has a tremendous thump and puff of white smoke, i love shooting this rifle. bore is shiny and rifling, if anything slightly thin, is very sharp.

I have to sell to pay for school, just goes to show you need to wait till you can truly afford a gun before buying!

Made in the same factory that produced top quality rifles for former Yugoslavia like the M70B1 and M70AB2, our newly manufactured PAP rifles are the semi-auto version of the famous military series  M70 rifles. These beauties are the latest imports from the world famous Zastava factory.

This one is the HI-CAP PAP Classic and features a full teak wood stock matching fore end wood and an ergonomic pistol grip. It also features a hammer forged barrel, specialized safety lever, and factory buttpad.

Unlike the first batch of imports this new second generation rifle also has a built in side rail mount for true hold accuracy when mounting a scope.
Rifle features a Beautiful Teakwood Stockand forearm and ergonomically shaped molded and textured pistol grip.  

Comes complete with One Original Yugo 30 round steel mag.....

Barrel: 16.25"" with a 1:10 twist, Overall: 36.25"", Weight: 7.7 lbs. Condition: New.

Yugo AK rifles are unique in the industry in that they have a bolt hold open capability and when used with original Yugo mags will lock the bolt 
back after the last shot is fired. Rifle will of course function properly with any AK mag but only the Yugo mag facilitates the bolt hold open. 

Rifle also features an exclusive safety lever design that also acts as a bolt lock / hold open for ultimate safety and lightning fast chambering.

Rifle comes complete with 1-30 round mag and cleaning rod. Mag included is the original Yugo mfg 30 round AK mag with the Bolt Hold Open follower. 
Mags are surplus and cosmetic condition on the mags included with the rifle may vary.

Legally accepts all high cap mags and drums regardless of country of origin.  

Receivers are stamped but slightly heavier than typical stamped receivers.  These are built like tanks.... 

 If you can only have one AK in your Arsenal let me suggest the PAP.

The Yugo AK's are regarded as some of the finest quality AK rifles in the world and these are no exception. 
Extremely well made with very tight tolerances - These rifles will feed, function and fire flawlessly for thousands and thousands of rounds.   

Shipping $25 to FFL ONLY.  MS residents 7% sales tax.  3% for cc.  
May be purchased directly from my website http://www.mcssl.com/store/f0abce2ec0a346dfbcac3621e92708/rifles/ak-47-yugo-m70 which includes the 3% for cc's.  Buy before it's too late.  This is the gun that the powers that be do not want you to have.

Fun gun to shoot, no recoil, and you don't have to worry about feeding issues if you like to buy the cheap stuff which is the reason I decided to go with a revolver for a 22 instead of Semi-auto.

This gun also has a safety key so that if you have kids you can lock the trigger so that it can be loaded and still not be able to fire but can quickly be disabled if needed. 

Cleaned and oiled after every shoot. No issues what so ever with this gun."
