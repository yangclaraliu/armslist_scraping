Specifically designed for military and self-defense applications, the Klarus XT11 outshines the competition with its extremely durable build, brilliant 600-lumen output, and stainless steel strike bezel that can be used to ward off attackers. Like its smaller cousin, the XT10, the XT11 uses Klarus's dual button tail switch that allows for one-handed control and easy access to its blinding strobe function. The strike bezel can also be unscrewed to attach other accessories like colored filters. If you want to weapon mount the XT11, it is fully compatible with the ED10 Remote Pressure Switch.

I purchased this light on a whim and have not used it except to play around with it. It has never been mounted on a gun. The batteries were charged only one time. This is an amazing light, super bright and lightweight. The specifications are below. Or you can check it out at the Kalrus website.

Asking $125 (If you purchased everything new it would be about $175). Cash, FTF in the Littleton Area preferred. Not looking for any trades.

Specifically designed for military and self-defense applications, the Klarus XT11 outshines the competition with its extremely durable build, brilliant 600-lumen output, and stainless steel strike bezel that can be used to ward off attackers. Like its smaller cousin, the XT10, the XT11 uses Klarus's dual button tail switch that allows for one-handed control and easy access to its blinding strobe function. The strike bezel can also be unscrewed to attach other accessories like colored filters. If you want to weapon mount the XT11, it is fully compatible with the ED10 Remote Pressure Switch.

DESCRIPTIONFEATURESTECHNICAL SPECSSPEC SHEETExpanding on the popularity of the pump action rifle, Taurus introduces the Model 72 chambered for .22 Magnum. The Model 72 holds 10 or 11 rounds in its tubular magazine. This gun looks, feels and shoots like the original, but with the addition of modern safety features and manufacturing methods. The Model 72 features a manual safety, button rifled barrels for accuracy and stocks of fine hardwoods. The fully adjustable sights allow for accurate shooting.

  Taurus Security System (TSS)3
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. 
  Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

But I am up for any offers. I have silver coins and/or cash to add (or vice versa).  Feel free to email or text (please no calls) 314-3to3-seven384

Also, I would prefer no paperwork (worried about this Obama character) but I'm not going to sell to someone who isn't legal to own, would prefer a CCW (like myself) but not a deal breaker.Thanks!"

continuous rail with no gapping along flat top. Rubber ladders intact.
16 inch barrel Mil L/E,CMV,HPT,MPI,1/7 twist barrel, Upgraded quadrail
Milled Spike's L/E upper reciver
Mid length gas system- most dependable over carbine and rifle length gas system.
These rifles just don't jam. I have an older model with over 3000 rounds and maybe 10 jams from dud ammo. Even with cheaper ammo, it will eat most whatever you feed it.
Chrome lined barrel very sharp, shiny, bore,1/7 twist rate

Extra spring kit-39.99
Extra trigger group-40.00
New hell fire trigger reset external spring kit installed-79.99. Allows for bumpfire from regular grip configuration. Comes off with a hex key(really works)!!! Lateral folding grip makes this easy. Just stiffen your middle finger and pull forward on lateral foregrip like a bump stick built in and looks alot cleaner, and less movement than bump stock. Legal full auto. Easy control. Look up bump fire and it is that simplified.
Single stage mil-spec duty trigger with lightning cut lightweight hammer. 30 round brownell's magazine
Spike's Q/D locking swivel sling mount, 12 possible mounts on rail.
A few boxes of nicer L C Tracer and Hornady Zombie max ammo.
New thick soft case.
All mil spec components.
The quadrail is  the nicer rail system offered from Spike's. A specter,( 10 inch) length. I didn't cut corners and use a cheap rail, all Spike's.
There is a minimum of 8-12 months wait on all spike's rifles and most parts. Bolts are over 200.00 on e-bay.That was last month when I called Spike's but This one is ready for cash and carry. 
This upper as is goes for over 1100.00. Rail alone is almost 400.00.
Stripped lower was 220.
Rifle is high quality and value is only increasing. Not one round down tube, Completely new rifle ready for optics. I am moving and just need the money and home defense weapon that wont be overkill. This gun is designed to stabilize even heavier .223 and 5.56 rounds properly.

  I have an excam , made in Italy , Replica of the Colt 1851 Navy . 44 caliber ""Ball and Cap "" percussion 6 shot revolver with a sea battle on the cylinder. 
  I received it in used condition but it is in great shape . I have not test fired it . It is intact except for a  screw missing from the barrel wedge that tightens the barrel action to the frame , of which I do not recommend shooting until this screw is in place, tightening up the barrel and frame. And a small chip of wood missing from the toe corner bottom of the left grip.
 I do not know to much about Black powder revolvers but this one is in great shape . All that is needed is the screw . I just got off the internet searching the value of the excam 1851 Navy .44 revolver and the value ranges from ; $275.00 to around $475.00 with just the one screw missing , I have reasonably priced this revolver for anyone to own ! 
  As you can see in the pics , I took apart the colt 1851 excam to show the condition of the cylinder pin where the barrel wedge is installed . I have a feeling that the revolver was fired without the wedge screw , which is missing and slightly egged out the wedge cut out . I say , ""when in doubt , change it out to be safe ""! Remember that this revolver is used but like new except for the wedge screw missing and the cylinder pin wedge cut bruised. I have included a cross draw holster made of what looks like a soft leather with leaf designs on it, dark brown in color. You do not need to register this with an F.F.L. dealer but I do require a photo of yourself and a signature of proof that you are over 18 years of age.
  I could only post three pics , I do have more detailed pics that I can send you if needed.

Great condition and used very little.  Has fiberglass ramrod, because the wooden one is such a small diameter that it was too easy to break.  I have about qty. 75-100 hornady .31"" round balls I am including with this gun.  I hate tell sell it, but I was paralyzed in an accident and I no longer use it.  I have had it since 1988 when I bought it at a gun store while in college.  I removed the sights years ago with the intent to put a scope on it and I misplaced them and cannot find.  I did some checking and found you can get replacement sights from Thompson Center or after market neon sights that are really easier to see for under $75. The stock has no marks, the barrel has one dent/nick near the Thomp/Center gun maker stamp that I show in one photo. This was in there when I bought it, and a small scratch in the brass on the butt plate.  No rust at all.  I also have a homemade speed loader with 5 shots that I am including.   I am pretty sure that that Thompson Center made this Cherokee model so that you can also put a .45 barrel on this frame.

This weapon is tack driving accurate. I am asking $600- or best offer.Trades considered as well. I am putting the full description of the weapon from the CZ website below.

 The Phantom is all about combining full-sized shootability and firepower (18+1 rounds of 9mm Luger) with all-day carry comfort. The polymer construction and radically scalloped forged steel slide make the SP-01 Phantom one of the lightest full-size autos out there. In fact, it is a full 33% lighter than the steel-framed models, making it ideal for all-day carry.

Retaining the superior grip geometry of the SP-01, the Phantom has less perceived recoil than models of similar weight and power, and is unmatched in its natural point of aim.

The Phantom features a decocking lever, accessory rail and two interchangable grip inserts to accommodate users with different sized hands. It has an 18+1 round capacity in 9mm and will also accept all previous CZ 75 model magazines (both full and restricted capacities)."

The wood grips are more challenging as they usually require refinishing to get the cut wood to match up with non cut wood. I charge $15 for the modification and $3 for shipping.

Here is a review with specs on the gun:

http://hunting.about.com/od/guns/l/aastrugerp97a.htm

I have installed a heavy duty recoil reducing rod and spring, a custom trigger, & a heavy barrel for increased accuracy. The gun comes with 3-10 rd Pro Mag high capacity mags, 1-7 rd Ruger factory mag, & 1-8 rd Ruger factory mag, Fobus Elite paddle holster, & hard case. 

I also have a ruger 10 22 (black & stainless) with less than 50 rounds fired, that I can throw in for the right offer.

I am looking for a higher quality semi auto pistol (preferably in .45acp). 

I might be open to other offers as well, worst I can say is no.

Let me know what you have and maybe we can make a trade.

This model is no longer available and its US-made replacement - the P220 Compact - is slightly heavier, making it less desirable for concealed carry.

The pistol is slightly used, probably about 500 rounds. It has a few very minor cosmetic marks and a little holster wear on the slide. Everything works perfectly and it is capable of shooting nice, tight groups all day with any ammo.

The price is $675 OBO and sale is FTF for cash only in the Twin Cities area. Buyer must have valid and current MN Driver's License and MN Permit to Carry."

This is the top of the line model from Magnum Energy. This unit was removed from a 2006 Prevost bus and was purchased by my partner to power his houseboat which he has now sold. It is very high end and made completely in the USA. If you need an inverter and charger just google this brand and model and you will see that it is about the best you can get. Will turn 12V DV power from solar cells, an alternator, or batteries into regular 110V house current for use in a boat, home, RV, or whatever to power lights, appliances, or anything else you may need. We never installed it but we did test it to make sure it worked correctly and it is packed with features. It is high tech and one of the best on the market, with all kinds of built in protection circuitry. I believe it has 2 separate 30 amp output circuits to power a standard breaker box. Can also automatically sense when AC current is present from a land line or generator and allow it to pass through, as well as use it to monitor and charge up your battery or battery bank as needed. This is what is used in the high end motor homes and even some off the grid type houses. For a picture and a full list of specs and features just google the brand and model number and you will see that it doesn't get any better than this. This is a $1850 retail price unit, but you can actually buy them new for about $1500 so I am asking only 1/2 of that. Will sell for $750 cash OBO, or make me any trade offers for a firearm or firearms that are actually worth this kind of money, you never know what I might be interested in.

As for trades I'm most interested in a commander size 1911 from a quality maker (Colt, Kimber, Sig, S&W, Les Baer, Dan Wesson....etc) Id prefer it be a more modern 1911...beavertail, good sights, extended thumb safety. All offers will be considered, but i'm probably gonna hold out for a nice 1911.....Not interested in a full size 1911 at this time, i have too many of those. 

I have cash to add for the right trade"
