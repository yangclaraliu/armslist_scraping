This gun is less than a week old and has never been fired. I still have the original box and all the accessories that came with it. If you're interested it's probably better to txt or call me(Jon) at REDACTED because I can't always check my emails and wouldn't want anyone to miss an opportunity to have a basically brand new gun at a nice discount.
85,http://www.armslist.com/posts/151085,For Sale/Trade:  Peltor Comtac II Comms Earpro Headset,"Bremerton, will travel or ship, Seattle, Washington",$ 500,"Listed On: Sunday, June 19, 2011",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I got this headset in a trade and while it is an absolutely fantastic headset, I don't need the comms potential and only want earpro. so, I'm trying to turn this into something else.

This is a Peltor Comtac II headset, with dual hardwired PTT downleads for connecting two radios (one per earcup). It has a boom mic that can be switched from one side to the other, and a behind-the-neck wire instead of the headstrap. It is incredibly comfortable and has massive comms potential with the ability to accept a variety of radios - and TWO AT A TIME.

Also, it runs on a pair of AA batteries and has excellent noise reduction, both active and passive. The active sound blocking is so precise, that if you snap your fingers near the microphone it will shut it out and then instantly continue letting you listen to everything around you. I was completely blown away by the quality of the sound in these.

I'm selling for $500 or best offer, but I would prefer to trade for or towards a gun or body armor...Email me with your offer, and I'll consider it."

 Up for your consideration today is this Sig Sauer P250 2SUM in the popular .40S&W caliber. New from SIG SAUER. 
You can now get complete out-of-the-box versatility with the SIG SAUER P250 2SUM. This offer provides you with a full-size P250, ideal for duty, home defense or sport, and all the components to rapidly convert it to the P250 Subcompact, a perfect conceal carry gun. Two Glocks $1,200, Two M&P's $1,160, Two XD's $1,090, 2SUM from SIG, HUNDREDS LESS! Fitted to the Task-And The Shooter The two overriding questions that must be asked when purchasing a pistol are: How is it going to be used? and By whom? The P250 makes those questions much less critical by being adaptable to a variety of tasks and a variety of shooters. It has the ability to be configured in everything from full sized range pistol to a deep concealment weapon, in any of four calibers. And, the selection of grip modules, coupled with a standard or short trigger, means it can be fitted to a wide range of hand sizes.

   I've got a number of these Sig 250's and they are great. These that are 2Sum are like getting two guns for the price of one. One full frame and one sub compact. Depending on which size you want at the time it only takes seconds to switch the trigger control group to the desired frame size. Bottom line you get the best of both worlds and down the road you have the ability to change calibers, 9mm,357 Sig or 45acp.

Both mags will be fully loaded with ammo.

It is in a like new condition. 

The AS trigger system of the Walther P99 has three possible carry modes: 

AS Mode The first is the AS mode which will automatically engage after a round is chambered. The trigger is fully forward, as if in double action, but the striker indicator is to the rear and visible. This mode offers the safety of carrying the P99 AS in single action with a light yet long trigger pull. 

DA Mode The second mode is Double Action. After a round is chambered, the decocking button can be depressed, releasing the striker into a double action trigger pull. In this mode the trigger is fully forward and the striker is at rest and no longer visible to the rear of the slide. After the trigger is first pulled, all subsequent shots will be in single action. This mode is considered, among fellow P99 AS owners, to be the safest mode to carry the AS in. 

SA Mode The third mode of carry for the P99 AS is Single Action. This mode can be achieved by chambering a round into the AS mode, then slowly pulling the trigger to the rear until you hear the SA portion of the sear engage. There will be an audio able click and the trigger will remain in the rear position. This mode will also automatically engage after the first trigger pull in double action mode. 


The barrel and slide have been hardness treated in the same manner that Glock has been, but Walther calls it by another trade name than Tennifer. 

I would like to trade for Walther P99C. Roind count at 200. No low ball offers please.

Shoots 9mm Largo cartridge or the .38 ACP (not Super) cartridge.  Comes with one (1) magazine.  The Serial number on the barrel and slide match.I found a little history about the pistol from Wikipedia and its as follows.


The Astra modelo 400 adopted by the Spanish military as the Astra Modelo 1921, was a semi-automatic pistol produced by Spanish weapons manufacturer Astra-Unceta y Cia SA.[1]
The Spanish War Ministry of King Alfonso XIII began tests in 1919 to replace the Campo Giro pistol as the standard military sidearm. The 9mm Largo Astra modelo 400, patented by Pedro Careaga, was selected for the Spanish Army in August, 1921, for the border patrol in October, 1922, for the prison armed guard in November, 1922, and for the Spanish Navy in September, 1923. Army pistols were marked with the military acceptance stamp on the left trigger guard web. Border patrol pistols were stamped with a large crown within a sunburst atop the slide, where Navy pistols were stamped with a large fouled anchor. Early pistols for commercial sale were generally stamped HOPE on the visible barrel hood. Serial numbers 36359 to 37200 were stamped MARINA DE CHILE for the Chilean Navy in 1930 and issued to coast guard personnel guarding lighthouses.[1]
Astra pistols were supplied to Republican Spain and to the Basque government which controlled the plant until the Bombing of Guernica in April, 1937. Astra pistols were subsequently produced for Nationalist troops, while Republican forces made approximately 22,000 copies of the pistol in Terrassa (marked F. Ascaso) and Valencia (marked RE for Republica Espanola). Astra production after the civil war was for Nationalist troops except serial numbers 92851 to 98850 for Nazi Germany. Astra ceased production in 1946 after the Spanish military adopted the Star Model A as the standard sidearm in 1945. Additional pistols were assembled from parts inventories until 1951. Spanish military inventories were sold to civilian wholesalers between 1956 and 1965. A total of 106,175 pistols were produced at the Astra factory in Guernica, although the highest serial number is 105,275; because serial numbers 28901 to 29800 were duplicated in production for the Spanish Army and Navy.[1]
The Astra 400 is designed for the 9 mm Largo round, with some experimental models chambered in 7.63mm Mannlicher, .32 ACP and .30 Luger. 9mm Largo rounds were often in short supply outside of Spain and though several other 9mm cartridges like the 9mm Luger could be fired in an emergency, this caused excessive wear and stress on the weapon and is not recommended. The Astra 600, a slightly shorter version of the Astra 400 that is chambered in 9mm Luger, was later developed for export sales, primarily to Germany and Portugal. A smaller variant for both domestic and export sales, the Astra 300, was offered in .32 ACP and .380 ACP.

This Gun has only bee shot approximatly 50 rounds.  I have a beautiful jewel job on the barrel.  Any one with a Sig knows that due to the barrel lock up most sigs get a considerable wear pattern on the finish of the barrel.  that includes this p290, so I have jeweled the barrel and it looks great.

Rossi (Taurus) Model 462 .357 Stub Revolver. (Polished Stainless Steel with Black rubber grips)

I bought this gun and have never fired it because my local gun club has been under water since the spring thaw. My friend has the same revolver and I know that shooting the same one that it is very accurate. It handles both the .357 and .38 special rounds. Very compact design with 2” barrel. 

Reason for wanting to trade: I am looking for a semi-auto compact pistol for my g/f to use and feel .357 might be too much calibre for her to use.

I also have a Black leather pancake holster that I will include. If need be, I will also add some reloaded ammo in .357 and .38 spcl (about 50 rounds of each calibre). This gun is difficult to find. I had to special order it from Cabelas. This gun carries the lifetime warranty from Rossi and Taurus.

I would like to trade for a Springfield XD compact or XDM compact in .40s&w or 9mm. No duo tone guns. Just blued versions please. Or trade this gun & accessories/ammo plus cash for a M1 Garand.

1. Mossberg silver reserve 12 ga. (Over under.) $425. I just bought this gun in good condition. It has some light marks on the stock. The barrels and receiver are in perfect condition. Over all rating would be 90-95%. Locks up very tight, and the action works well.

2. Stoeger Condor field 12ga/20ga combo.$475 This means it has one set of 12 ga. barrels and another set of 20ga barrels!! I also just bought this gun in good condition. The 12ga barrels have one blemish on the side, nothing serious. The 20ga is in great condition. The stock has light marks on it. The previous owner said he bought it new, shot about 100 out of the 20ga for rabbit hunting. Claimed the 12ga he only shot 4 rounds from, I put another ~20 through it. Rate at 90-95% as well.

I will do a deal on both, I will trade up or down on one or both. Just let me know your offer and I will let you know what I think.

I have nothing particular in mind for a trade. Although I will say I have very little interest in revolvers. Other than that just send me an offer. Best trade offers would include mid-higher end 12ga.(semi or pump.) 9mm carry pistol.

No pictures at the moment. Although I can take pictures if it turns into that big of a problem.

In 1941, after a decade of planning, Argentines established a large and diversified military-industrial complex under the overall supervision of the Direccion General de Fabricaciones Militares (D.G.F.M.)

Taurus PT845 .45ACP
Posted by Chris Christian. Author Archive » 

Based on a pistol for the US Armed Forces but with a “strike two” capability!



When the United States Special Operations Command announced that it was considering adopting a new service handgun, and laid down the performance requirements for the pistol, a number of handgun makers responded. The result was several new handgun designs that, in light of the postponement of the SOCOM tests, have now been made available to the civilian market.

One was the Taurus 24/7 OSS. As a full-sized service handgun it’s proven to be rugged and reliable. But it’s a bit much to pack concealed on a daily basis. Taurus responded by taking some of the ergonomic features of the 24/7 OSS, adding a few innovations, trimming the size and weight, and introduced a new line of mid-sized semi-auto handguns. The result was the Taurus 800 Series that was introduced in 2008. It is available in 9mm (PT809, 17+1) .40 (PT840, 15+1) and .45ACP (PT845, 12+1). For our test we had the big bore .45ACP model.

The PT845 .45ACP is built on a polymer frame with either a forged steel slide with a black Tennifer finish, or a stainless steel slide. My test model wore the Tennifer finish. A captive recoil spring with a full-length stainless steel guide rod mated with a bushingless barrel to complete the upper unit.

The empty weight is a relatively light 28.2 ounces. The ramped barrel measures 4 inches, providing an overall length of 8.25 inches, a height of 6-inches, and a width of 1.14 inches. An integral rail allows for easy mounting of light or laser. Capacity is 12+1. 

Ergonomics
Noted pistolsmith Wayne Novak, who made a career out of customizing concealed carry handguns, once observed that a good carry pistol “should feel like a well used bar of soap.” It has become an overused cliché, but I can’t find a better way to describe the way the PT845 comes into my hand. 

The backstrap features Taurus’ aggressive ribbed checkering, while the rear portion of the side panels are smooth. The ribbed pattern continues on the front portion of the side panels and wraps around the front strap, where two slight projections create a subtle finger groove effect. Right and left side memory grooves channel the trigger finger to the proper position. When my hand contacts the gun in the holster a proper shooting grip is automatically achieved. 

Complementing that is a nicely undercut triggerguard that has the sharp lower edge relieved. I own several makes of polymer framed pistols and shoot them regularly. All required some attention with a Dremel tool to smooth the triggerguard edge. That wasn’t necessary with the PT845. It’s a very comfortable pistol.

Three interchangeable backstraps of different sizes are supplied. They are changed by drifting out a solid retaining pin at the lower portion of the backstrap, which also serves as a lanyard loop, and sliding a different size insert into place. I have average-sized hands and the backstrap that arrived on the gun was an excellent fit for me, so I felt no need to try the other two sizes. 

Firing Mechanism
Taurus notes that the PT845 was derived from the Taurus 24/7 OSS series, but the firing mechanism is quite a bit different. This is not a striker-fired, internal hammer pistol. A slide mounted inertia-type firing pin provides the primer blow. This is a traditional DA/SA design with an external hammer and has repeat strike capability. In the same manner as the CZ-75 or the Beretta Tomcat, the gun can be carried with the hammer in three different positions. When the hammer is fully lowered it provides a lengthy DA pull with a slight, but noticeable, stacking at the rear of the stroke. My Lyman Digital Trigger Pull Gauge says the pull is 10.5 pounds. Ease the hammer back slightly, to what amounts to a quarter-cock position, and about half of the trigger pull length is turned into take-up slack. The pull weight remains the same but the pull length is significantly reduced.

With the hammer in the SA mode the pull weight is a relatively crisp 6.5 pounds with only a suggestion of creep. The trigger is smooth faced and nicely rounded.

A frame-mounted ambidextrous safety allows the gun to be carried DA or SA (cocked and locked) and the safety can be engaged to block the trigger in each hammer position. The frame-mounted safety has a third position that also serves as a decocking mechanism. With the safety engaged in the up position, depressing it to the middle position disengages it. Push it further down to the third position and it decocks the pistol. The PT845 also includes an internal firing pin block that prevents the firing pin from moving forward until the trigger has been moved to its final rearward position.

Completing the operating controls are ambidextrous slide and magazine releases. A loaded chamber indicator peeks out from the upper side of the extractor when a round is chambered.

The PT845 does not have a magazine disconnect safety, and will fire with the magazine removed. The double stack magazines are solidly made with right side witness holes at 6 and 12 rounds and are a drop-free design. A finger extension base plate provides a comfortable rest for the support hand and also makes magazine insertion very positive. A magazine loading tool is provided, but I didn’t need it. Finger power alone was enough to easily get all 12 rounds into each of the two supplied magazines.

Sights are a three white dot pattern and are drift adjustable for windage. Both front and rear are dovetailed into the slide and securely retained via an Allen screw. They are cut a bit taller than many other sights and allow a generous amount of light around the front sight. I found them very quick to acquire.

The PT845 arrived in a foam-lined pad lockable case with two magazines, a bristle bore brush, magazine loading tool, two additional interchangeable backstraps, and two keys to activate the Taurus Security System lock, which is located on the rear portion of the lower right rear grip panel.

Range Time
Prior to heading out to my backyard range I did a quick field strip and added oil to the appropriate points. A Bianchi Model 7 Shadow II three-slot pancake holster for the Glock 29/30 was an excellent fit for the Taurus. So, I headed out to the range with the PT845 and holster.

Test ammunition included 230-grain Winchester Target/Range FMJ, Federal’s 230-grain Hydra-Shok and 165-grain EFMJ, Hornady’s 185-grain Custom XTP JHP, Remington’s 230-grain Golden Saber, and my 230-grain LRN match reload. I also had a hundred 185-grain lead semi-wadcutter reloads of dubious heritage that I figured would be a good test for feeding, so they were included.

Working from the holster, my initial shooting was no more complex than ringing some hanging plates and bouncing empty beverage cans from the 10- to 15-yard mark. The gun proved to be a natural pointer that came quickly to hand. And, even with full power 230-grain loads, it was very controllable and soft shooting.

The gun fed everything that went into the magazine (even the 185-grain LSWC reloads) and case ejection was smooth and consistent. 

Once I had about 200 rounds through the gun I settled down on a 15-yard sandbag rest, shooting SA, for accuracy tests. The PT845 was not a fan of swaged lead reloads, but did have an affinity for jacketed fodder. The 230-grain loads showed the best accuracy, as is often the case with the .45ACP, but lighter bullet weights proved more than accurate enough for self-defense tasks. 

Timed Drills
Plinking, bench rest accuracy tests, and a few basic handling drills can tell you a lot about how a pistol will perform, but they don’t give me as clear a picture as does running the gun under some degree of stress or at the least, running timed drills against the clock. An IDPA or USPSA match would have been a nice test, but with only two magazines in hand it wasn’t in the cards. Instead, I ran some of my basic practice drills with my PACT III Club Timer. I have been running these drills for years and know what my normal PAR time/score is with whichever of my match guns I’m running.

The first test was three IDPA targets set up 6 feet apart at 7 yards. The drill is simple: at the buzzer, draw and double tap each target. I ran this ten times with 230-grain Winchester Target/Range full power ball ammo. The first two runs were 4.46 and 4.27 seconds respectively. The next eight runs were between 3.93 and 3.67 seconds. The second drill is a single IDPA target at 7 yards, two to the chest and one to the head. Ten runs produced times of 2.41 to 2.33 seconds.

The times on the first drill were within a half-second of my normal time with my match-tuned .45ACP, while the times on the second drill were almost identical. The scores were not quite as good. I had a tendency to drop the first round a bit low and out of the 0-zone with the DA pull, but follow-up shots were on the mark with the gun in the SA mode. That, however, is comparing a stock, out-of-the-box, DA/SA semi-auto in a high ride concealed carry holster against a match tuned semi-auto with a crisp 3.5-pound trigger, fiber optic sights, handloads softer than full power ball, and from a straight drop Blade-Tech competition holster. 

Final Notes
Well over 300 rounds went downrange in this test. They included bullet weights from 230 to 165 grains, as well as some dubious semi-wadcutter reloads. The only malfunctions were my operator errors with the thumb safety. Once the basic tests were done, I cleaned the gun, stuffed it with Federal Hydra-Shoks, and carried it for two weeks in place of the compact 9mm that’s my normal carry gun. I found it to be every bit as comfortable to carry. That’s a lot to ask from a pistol that packs 12+1 rounds of .45ACP, but the PT845 delivered.

This gun has less than 200 rounds fired through it, and it is in fantastic shape.  It was cleaned each time it was fired, has never seen any kind of bad weather, and was safe stored when not in use.  In the 200 rounds that were ran through it, there was not one FTF, FTE, or problem of any kind.

The pistol comes with all the factory accessories (case, speed loader, paperwork, lock, brush), plus I have an extra 13 round magazine for a total of three.  I will also include all of the .40 caliber ammo I have left, which is about 2/3 of a box of Winchester 180 gr. JHP and one magazine full of Winchester White Box.

I'm only looking for FTF, and I am willing to drive a little to complete the sale.  Just for my peace of mind, I would prefer to see a driver's license and carry license at the time of sale.  Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

The records do not indicate when the corporation ended, however, state corporation fees were no longer paid after the 1974 tax year. The company utilized a post office box in Dunellen, NJ for their corporate records and carbine related business. Plainfield Machine was a machine shop. They manufactured and contracted to manufacture for other businesses. Carbines bearing the Plainfield Machine name did not begin appearing until 1965. 

War Baby Comes Home by Larry Ruth, pages 748-752 discusses Plainfield Ordnance and their carbines. Ruth indicates the company history is somewhat fuzzy, but Plainfield was the successor to Millville Ordnance. The ""Millville Ordnance"" name was trademarked in New Jersey in October 1960, at an address in Union, NJ. For further on Millville Ordnance, refer to the web page devoted to their carbines. 

Exactly who manufactured what, when, and where, versus contracting with Plainfield Machine Co., has not been determined. What is clear is carbines bearing the logo of Millville Ordnance (MOCO within a banner) were the predecessors of carbines bearing the name Plainfield Machine. Ruth's work on Plainfield Machine and their inner workings is interesting, and includes an employee's insight into the day to day operations and changes over time. 

The earliest advertisement for a Plainfield Machine M1 carbine, found so far, appears in Shotgun News May 1, 1962.

I would prefer a Keltec, but would also consider a Ruger LCP. I don't want to dump a lot of money into a gun that most likely will never be shot after the initial range trip. For some reason I see a lot of LCP sellers with them priced $25 to $50 more than what they can be bought for new, which is under $300. 

Would expect a slightly used Keltec to be at or just over $200. I can find them for that constantly. Only not within driving distance which is what I'm after because the cost of the gun does not justify the cost of shipment and transfer. I can meet in the Knoxville area, Tri-cities, about anywhere in East TN. Just ask. 
Would expect to pay more for a Ruger, they are a little nicer, but for this guns purpose, the Keltec would do.

Let me know what you have and what you want for it, as well as where you are located.

Thank you."

Gun comes with (2) 14 round magazines. One that seems to be factory and one I picked up that I think was made by KBI (Charles Daly).
Not gonna lie, this gun needs some work. It's no safe queen. Shooting Wolf 9mm I can get it through two magazines after a cleaning before it will jam. After that it does so about twice a mag. A competent gunsmith or an experienced amateur might be able to fix it, but I""m not that person, and I have no interest in putting money into it with the finish not 100%.
As a result, I don't expect much in a way of trade.

 Both mags will be fully loaded with ammo.

 It is in a like new condition. 

The AS trigger system of the Walther P99 has three possible carry modes: 

AS Mode The first is the AS mode which will automatically engage after a round is chambered. The trigger is fully forward, as if in double action, but the striker indicator is to the rear and visible. This mode offers the safety of carrying the P99 AS in single action with a light yet long trigger pull. 

DA Mode The second mode is Double Action. After a round is chambered, the decocking button can be depressed, releasing the striker into a double action trigger pull. In this mode the trigger is fully forward and the striker is at rest and no longer visible to the rear of the slide. After the trigger is first pulled, all subsequent shots will be in single action. This mode is considered, among fellow P99 AS owners, to be the safest mode to carry the AS in. 

SA Mode The third mode of carry for the P99 AS is Single Action. This mode can be achieved by chambering a round into the AS mode, then slowly pulling the trigger to the rear until you hear the SA portion of the sear engage. There will be an audio able click and the trigger will remain in the rear position. This mode will also automatically engage after the first trigger pull in double action mode. 


The barrel and slide have been hardness treated in the same manner that Glock has been, but Walther calls it by another trade name than Tennifer. 

I would like to trade for Walther P99C. Roind count at 200. No low ball offers please. 

Will trade for: Walther P99C, PPS, XDM, Kimber, Sig, HK, Beretta Inox, Judge  (+/- cash as needed)

Seriously one of my favorites up to this point but alas I need more review subjects for the site and cash is low thanks to the birth of our second bundle of joy a couple months ago. 

The Full Review with high def pics and video are here: http://www.hausofguns.com/2011/04/02/cz-rami-2075-9mm-review/

The CZ comes with 3 magazines, a CCW type 10 rounder and two 14 rounders with the extended grip sleeve. They're technically full length CZ 75 mags with the grip fitting for the RAMI and they are VERY comfortable. It's the steel frame model and has been reliable 100% for me as I'm the original shooter with the round count at just over 200. 

I need the cash more than anything, but am not opposed to trades. 9mm and 45 acp are welcome, no 40 S&W though. Not even worth trying. This gun is in LNIB condition, not a scratch on it and is already broke in for you. If you have trade considerations I prefer that they are in the same condition is mine. Price is $500.

The Public Defender Polymer uses a steel sub-frame, with the grip, trigger guard, barrel shroud, and top strap made of reinforced polymer. Polymer is lightweight, self-lubricating, and does not rust. Nobody is going to accuse the new Polymer Judge of being just a pretty face. Like the rest of the Judge series of revolvers, Poly can shoot 45 Colt ammunition, and it does it well. However, its forte is its ability to throw a charge of buckshot, birdshot, or a combination of both for a formidable weapon for close-range personal defense. Since the Judge was first introduced, folks have been walking into gun stores and asking for “the carjacker gun”, as it was recognized early on as being an ideal carjacker repellant. If someone jerks your car door open and immediately gets a face-full of birdshot, he will suddenly have a change of priorities, I promise you. At across-the-room distances, a load of buckshot, or even better, the new Winchester PDX1 load that contains three flattened disks and twelve pellets of plated BB-sized shot, makes for a very good defensive load from a handgun. It is not equivalent to a heavy payload of shot from a twelve gauge shotgun, but it is a whole lot lighter weight of a weapon to carry. Poly is small enough and light enough to conceal well under a jacket or un-tucked shirt, and rides very well in a cross draw holster while seated in a vehicle, for immediate access.
