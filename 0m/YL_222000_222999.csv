I have an H&R Pardner 12ga Tactical Shotgun for sale as well, in a different listing.

I have had alot of offers for this gun, so many that it was hard to keep up.
I removed the original listing because I thought it was sold, but the buyer had to back out. 

Cash plus 9mm FMJ ammo is good too. I can always use a little 9mm ammo.  

I reply to emails generally within 10 minutes, especially in the morning and late afternoon until I go to bed around midnight, so check your email soon after you message me.

The Llama is a very nice gun with almost perfect blued finish, and VERY low round count. It is date coded 1993. It is a 9mm. it comes with one 9 rd magazine. Extra 9rd 9mm mags are easily available from Cheaper than Dirt for 17.50. The frame is compatible with colt parts, you could make this a project gun and turn it in to a .45. Numrich Gun Parts at www.gunpartscorp.com has a wide selection of parts, barrels, slides in different calibers for this pistol at very reasonable prices. I had some aftermarket upgrade 1911 parts (ext. beavertail, slide release, hammer, ambi. safety and trigger to name some), on this at one time but ended up putting them on another 1911, and they worked fine. The only thing that I found not to fit right was grips, the holes dont match up. I have seen some pretty nice grips in different styles on Ebay for reasonable.

What it is: 1942 Izhevsk Ex-sniper PEM Sidemount 91/30 Refurb
Details: Non-matching, Bore and Crown are Excellent and has not been recrowed or counter-bored

A little history on the PEM type side mounts, they were the least produced of all Sniper 91/30s and are counted as the most rare of all Mosin Nagant sniper variants. There's also a very high likely-hood that this particular rifle was used in the battle of Stalingrad (Rifle made in '42, battle ended in '43) because of the production date and the Soviet's use of snipers in the battle.


Restoration: It would cost about $600-$700 to get it restored to it's original form if you were to do so, I toyed with the idea but it's too rich for my blood at this point.


Range report: I took it out shooting once, I ran 4 rounds of Bulgarian 182gr through it on a windy day and had all four 1"" from each other in a row just in the black (was 100 yards, didn't account for the sights being for meters).


More pictures are to come (maybe tomorrow), I'm away from home right now so you'll have to bare with me here. There are also two more plugged holes above the chamber area for the mount."

The AR-15A3 model AR6721is an exceptional patrol rifle with tactical accuracy chosen by federal, state and local agencies. The 16.1"" (40.9 cm) heavy barrel with 1 in 9"" (229 mm) rifling twist allows flexibility in ammunition selection. The telescopic buttstock adjusts to four positions to enhance mobility and fit to a wider range of operators. In position, the removable carrying handle provides an M16A4 target style sight adjustable for windage and elevation to 600 meters. Easily removable, the flat top upper receiver allows for easy mounting of optical, night vision and other tactical sighting systems. The tactical carbine is the answer to all the requirements of modern law enforcement.

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. Two finishes are available; Two-tone and corrosion resistant Nitron. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

It has been kept in a humidity controlled gun cabinet for 22 years. Only had about 9-10 rounds go through it (it also killed a buck in 1981). The scope was $450 when bought, $35 for the scope mounts, $50 for the scope bases, and $550 for the rifle brand new. I am trying to get $800 out of her, but send me y'alls offers and we will see what we can come up with. She has Excellent wood on her. I just cleaned and lubed her down today. It has the classic style safety that is easier to work with (unline the new ruger's), i'll even throw in 2 boxes of ammo if we can strike up a deal ($30 a box i paid for them)."

about the gun: its a remington 700 synthetic 30-06 with only 40 rounds through the barrel comes with 80 rounds of 30-06 and is tapped for weaver scope rings. length of pull is short about 11.5 inches great for smaller people or kids who like to shoot. Normal rifles are normally 14 inches length of pull which is normally to long for many people even 6 feet tall.  The gun has just sat in my tiny gun locker for 5 years and just gets looked at. 

Why am I selling? My wife needs a small .38 special pink from smith and Wesson."

I do not know enough about the 1911 to know what all the gunsmiths did. My father had the work done and I know it was very extensive. Lost the paperwork in a divorce so you will have to know what you are looking for if you care to know. The gun has been in my family for >20 years. Been kept clean and oiled. Shoots better than me. Perfect for someone looking for a CF.

The M&P is a striker fired semi-automatic pistol. This trigger system prevents the firearm from discharging unless the trigger is fully depressed, even if the pistol is dropped. 

The pistol frame is made out of Zytel polymer reinforced with a stainless steel chassis. The slide and barrel are made out of stainless steel that after through hardening is treated with a proprietary nitriding process called Melonite. The Melonite process produces a matte gray-colored, non-glare surface with a 68 Rockwell C surface hardness rating. The pistol has a very low slide profile which holds the barrel axis close to the shooter's hand and makes the M&P more comfortable to shoot by reducing muzzle rise and allowing for faster aim recovery in rapid shooting sequence. The slide has four contact points with the frame. This was done to make the rail system self cleaning, by leaving room for any dirt or small foreign objects to fall out of the weapon.

I have a unique offering. Here is a beautiful condition Gen 2 Glock 19 compact 9mm. In my opinion, these are the best shooting, best looking Glocks ever produced.

In case you aren't familiar with Glocks, these Gen 2 models without finger grooves are highly desirable. Personally, they fit my hand much better than the newer models with the finger grooves. Guys spend hundreds of dollars sending their newer model 19s off to have grip reductions in order to mimic the look and feel of Gen 2 Glocks.

This gun in particular was produced on June 28, 1994, and I believe it to have 500 or fewer rounds down the pipe. I have NEVER experienced any type of malfunction in the 300+/- rounds I have sent down range.

I do not have to sell this gun, I am just looking to shuffle up the safe a bit. With that being said, don't bother with low-ball offers or silly trades such as Jennings, Lorcin, or Hi-Point. 

A bill of sale will be required, and I am happy to complete one for you on a trade. Proof of OH residency and age in the form of a drivers license or CHL will also be required. CHL holders will be given preference on this gun.

Included in sale is original Glock Tupperware, pistol, and original 10 rd Magazine. I have a 15 rounder available also if the price/trade is right."

Do make offers, worse I’ll say is no. Those are just a few things I would like to have. Multiple weapons will also be considered. I am not interested in western/antique/muzzle loading/hunting weapons. I like tactical/ useful weapons. As for other than weapons, you can make offers. Not interested in sound systems or golf carts or sports cards. And I will consider values for your extras with trades and will be reasonable and hear out reasonable offers. I will respond as quickly as possible.

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.
The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.
This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.
The MR556A1 is manufactured in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system.
The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled.
The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems.
Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life.
But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore.
Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy.
The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy.
A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR5556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance.
Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition.
The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product.

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.
USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.
To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.
Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.
