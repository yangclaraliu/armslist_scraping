Before snubbing this as not being an ""Italian"" Beretta, do some research online and your find the only thing really superior in the Italian made 92's is the blueing.  The Italian made 92's did not meet US standards for Military use so the American made ones were.  Not saying one is better than the other.  BOTH are excellent.

Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt-action deer rifle. In fact, it’s not a descendant of anything. This first-born brainchild was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precision long-range shooting. Every inch of the never-before seen Model 98B is carved from years of hard-earned insight.
Thanks to its modular layout, this rifle can be adapted to fit each user’s exact needs. Its straight-line design, running from the muzzle to the shooter’s shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine.
The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip. This allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can then be easily manipulated, feeding a fresh round into the chamber as the bolt silently glides through a polymer guide.

As for optics and accessories, the 98B’s aluminum upper receiver boasts an 18-inch M1913 rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night sight or laser designator. An optional receiver extension can add six more inches to the already generous rail space. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions.
This revolutionary long-range weapon isn’t all work. Equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod, it’s also a pleasure to shoot. From its highly efficient muzzle brake to its shooter adaptable design and never-before seen performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action.

The working parts are all matching. The only exceptions are the nose cap and the stock, which are original replacements. This is NOT a drill rifle- the original stock split, which is why I had to put it in a new stock. Can be cleaned up with a little Jasco and steam, the paint will come right off. The original stock is included, along with a period-correct bayonet. The bayonet is English, stamped ""1907"" and then re-stamped ""1917"" over it. Bayonet has the crown stamp. The dark spots on the blade are just grease, not rust. Can take more pictures to prove it, or you could see it in person if you're seriously interested. As for the rifle, it's great. The crown, I'd rate an 8/10. The bore is dark, but with strong rifling. Great shooter. The magazine appears to be original. The gun still has about (in my non-professional opinion) 80% of the original bluing remaining. It's very rare to find a rifle like this in such good condition, especially with the parts all matching. I had this rifle appraised by a collector, and he valued it at around 450 without the bayonet. I'm including the bayonet, worth around 100 dollars, for free. All trades entertained, but I'd prefer anything military surplus, plus cash if necessary. Cash is king, etc. Thanks for looking! Any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. If you'd rather call, shoot me an email with your phone number and I'll drop you a line as soon as possible.
EDIT: Also included with this rifle is a box of 32 .303 cartridges from South Africa, headstamped 1943. These are cordite cartridges that do fire, but are being included for collector value. I'll have to dig them out of my storage, but I can show you a very similar picture. Worth about 50 dollars."

It is in very good condition with great bluing all around, except for a wear point on each side of the very front of the slide. This was made in the USA by Colt in the earlier 1970's, and not made in Spain (by Astra)  as some earlier types were prior to the Gun Control Act  of 1968.  Those made in Spain are so stamped on the right hand side behind the trigger.  Pistol has one magazine, and fires in single action only. The wood grips or panels are in  great condition with no damage or defects, with the Colt medallion.  This is about the smallest auto pistol out there, smaller even the the KelTec P32, although it is heavier than that model, with it's all steel construction versus polymer commonly seen today. This weighs 12.6 ounces with an empty magazine inserted. A rarely seen firearm, and a Colt as well."

I will say this is one of my favorite guns and most reliable I have ever owned. Ruger built these like tanks with superb craftsmanship and an American made product. It has the power and accuracy of a 1911, with a third of the take down and maintenance. I have never had any type of problem with it at all with all kinds of different ammunition.

Here is a review with specs on the gun:

http://hunting.about.com/od/guns/l/aastrugerp97a.htm

I have installed a heavy duty recoil reducing rod and spring, & a custom trigger. The gun comes with 3-10 rd Pro Mag high capacity mags, 1-7 rd Ruger factory mag, & 1-8 rd Ruger factory mag, Fobus Elite paddle holster, & hard case.

I also have a ruger 10 22 (black & stainless) with less than 50 rounds fired, that I can throw in for the right offer.

I am looking to trade for a Full Size 1911. Must be .45 acp, Must have extended beavertail, skeletonized hammer and trigger, preferably Ruger, Remington, or Sig. No Low quality please.

I might be open to other offers as well, worst I can say is no.

Let me know what you have and maybe we can make a trade.

Thanks.

It is the very rifle featured on their front page at redhawkrifles.com (although now it has the non-adjustable Bell and Carlson 700LA A2 stock as opposed to the A5 adjustable to save weight, and will be sold with the A2 stock as shown in the pictures with it inside the case). Their custom rifles are renowned for their accuracy, and this weapons system is capable of reliably hitting targets up to 1200 meters, making it a top choice for any precision hunting/tactical engagement. 

*Please note you can see more pictures via this downloadable zip file: http://cameronmacpherson.com/rifle-pics.zip

It was custom built upon a Remington 700 action, it has a heavy fluted tactical barrel threaded with a muzzle brake, a spiral fluted bolt, and a tactical bolt handle with a teardrop knob. The actual bolt and internal working mechanisms have been custom calibrated for maximum accuracy by the RHR gunsmiths. I have only fired the rifle 20 times in total when sighting in an old optic I have since replaced. The currently included optic is a mounted Nightforce NXS 5.5-20x56mm Mil Dot Optic with Zero Stop, brand new, I haven't even had a chance to sight it in.

In addition to the rifle, it comes with the following:

* New Nightforce NXS 5.5-20x56mm Mil Dot Optic with Zero Stop (mounted, unsighted)
* Pelican hardbody wheeled case pre cut out
* 2 5rd magazines
* 2 10rd magazines
* Harris tactical bipod
* Bell and Carlson 700 LA A2 tactical stock
* 38 rd rocky mountain custom match grade rounds with nosler bullets ($3-4 per rd)
* 20 rd box Fiocchi high grade ammunition
* 20 rd box standard grade Remington ammunition.  
* 1 .300 win mag laser boresighter. 

I'm terribly sorry to see this go, it is a work of beauty and one of my favorite rifles, but the realities of this economy are coming face to face with the fact that I never have a chance to actually use it. I'm hoping will go to a good home with someone who will be able to enjoy it more frequently. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to make a reasonable offer. I would greatly prefer to deal within Colorado, but I will ship to an FFL of your choice if need be.

Thanks for looking."

it's only seen 70 rounds,you can use these in a m&p 40 full size or can use it as a conversion barrel in a m&p 357 sig full size which makes you able to shoot both calibers.
i was told you can use these in the full size m&p 9 mm too but you might have to buy mags to make the conversion complete for a 9mm im not sure ,you might wanna look it up to see before buying this,i do know this works great if on a m&p 357 sig i used it not one failure  or jam whatsoever!

i paid 90.00 for it and there's a 3 month wait on these,this barrel is made by smith n wesson it's not a barrel made by another company so all you do is change the barrel out and it's ready to shoot,the m&p 357 sig and m&p 40 use the same magazines so this is all you need to make your handgun 2 guns in one!

Opened the box to test them around the house. Never seen the field, nor do they show ANY signs of ware, not a single scratch or scuff. Comes in original box will all documentation.

Would be interested in trading binoculars for a pistol + cash, or sell outright.  Some cash has to be included though or my fiancee will be VERY upset with me.

Let me know what you've got. Price is 1700obo (I am willing to move VERY little considering these have less than five minutes of use and I just paid $1900 for them)

I just bought this and received it today but something came up and need to sell it. :(It has never been mounted, only taken out of the pouch to be inspected, optic is still in factory packaging and price includes, cleaning brush, screwdriver, cleaning pads and CR123 batt.   

Here is the description of the optic from the seller that I purchased from:

It is finally here. A so called ""Venezuelan order"" production over-run scope. Reticule is optimized for 124gr bullet of 7.62x39mm. I have been selling this model tailored for AK-74 round for over a year now. But although popular, 5.45 is not nearly as popular as 7.62x39. I finally got a hold of these scopes made especially for that caliber. Main features of this scope are: Nitrogen filled to prevent fogging Extremely wide, practically unique field of view. 7.62x39 BDC Reticule illumination Nice and very clear glass Sturdy design This scope will help you make surprisingly accurate shots at distances of up to 600m or even more. Many people are not even aware that traditional AK can hit things that far. Well, it can and this scope will enable you to do that. The scope is brand new, never mounted. Comes with a military green cammo pouch with a sling, air brush, a screwdriver tool, user manual (in Russian), lens cleaning cotton cloth. CR123 battery is optional for an additional $3 Paypal will cost an additional 3.5% Shipping is $12 USPS Priority, insurance extra.  

He sells his for $550 + shipping. Mine is going for $530 shipped. You save $30 and get the same thing and you help a fellow calgunner out. This is the best comblock optic for a 7.62x39 AK and it's priced to move. 

I can meet locally in Riverside or North San Diego, take discreet paypal or payment +3%

This is for gas and maintenance on the car that would be needed to travel to bring it to you.
