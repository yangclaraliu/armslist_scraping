The rifle was an early import to the US (it has no importer marks). As per the markings on the gun and the serial, I am pretty sure it is a Maltby arsenal rifle. This rifle shows its age/character but functions like it should. The battle peep on the ladder sight is slightly bent as shown in the included pictures.

As for the ammo:

There are 30 rounds of Greek HXP ammo on stripper clips. The primers are not corrosive and the brass is reloadable. The ammo comes with the original bandolier and the 4 empty stripper clips. 

There remaining 750 rounds are Iraqi head stamped rounds on stripper clips, in 15 bandoliers. The Arabic head stamps show manufacture date of 1956. This ammo is cordite and corrosively primed so the brass is NOT reloadable. This ammo has some corrosion on it because of storage conditions. Most of it should fine to fire but there are small amount of casings that look like they may have some pitting and should not be fired. The stripper clips show more problems than the ammo itself because of metal types. Some of the strippers are serviceable, some are probably not.  Iraqi surplus ammo is collectible and bullets could be pulled from casings so there is still value even in the questionable ammo.

I am asking $650obo for the rifle plus ammo.
I am willing to consider cash plus partial trades.

I will need to see your IN Driver’s License and preferably your carry permit. I am located in Kosciusko County. If you can’t meet me within a reasonable distance (hour drive of Warsaw), let me know so can figure out shipping costs to your local FFL."

If you don't know what a Vepr is, it's the best Russian-made AK you can get your hands on (the photo is stock obviously). You need to install a bullet guide if you want to use hicap mags, but it's literally an hour of work and I have the thing in the mail.

PPS-43 is a Polish copy of the best SMG of WWII. Considered a handgun (stock welded closed), so with a CCW you can take it camping into national parks and such. The 7.62x25 round makes it a lot more manageable than similar AK pistols. 4x35 round mags with it.

The ammo is good combloc surplus in 1000+ round amounts, also low-recoil hollow core Czech 7.62x54 and a 640 tin of commercial 7.62x39 Brown Bear. I also have a few various Mosins, Rossi .22 revolver, CZ52, SKS stocks, kevlar helmet, Glock 33 round mag etc.etc., basically a lot of trade fodder, with more cool firearms available for good trades.

-----------

I'm looking mostly for old military rifles and handguns. Must be either common caliber (e.g. 7.62x54), or at least an obtainable caliber (e.g. 7.5 Swiss, not 8mm Steyr stuff). Specifically, I'm interested in: 
- SVT40, Vepr/AK54R, PSL. Basically a battle rifle in 7.62x54. In that order of preference. 
- Lahti pistol, especially Finn Lahti. 
- Broomhandle mauser. 
- 7.62x25 ammo. 
- Vepr 12. 12ga shotguns in general. 
- .22 rifle. 
- Russian SKSes. 
- Slidefire/bumpski AK stocks. 
- SKS bullpup stocks. 

Also interested in other battle rifles (not terribly interested in stuff like .308 - the current crisis moved it into $1/round area, might as well use .50), military handguns, bolt-actions, and other cool stuff. Shoot me an offer, worst I can say is no.

--------

I will take cash offers. But - look at what other people are asking on Gunbroker/here for the same item, on average, then offer me ten-fifteen percent less and we can haggle. Lowballs will be politely declined.

Best wishes,

Just to be clear, it is stripped.  It needs a ejection port cover (very easy install), and forward assist (simple roll pin install), both parts are pretty cheap and easy to install.  However, They do not need to be installed to function.

More on the rare side!!! Only 167,000 produced in 1944. Compared to over 400k in '41, over 680k in '42, and over 970K in '43; according to author Terence W. Lapin.

Model 1938 Carbine: A carbine based on the M1891/30 design that was produced from 1939 to 1945 at the Izhevsk arsenal and in 1940 and 1944 at Tula. They were intended for use by second-echelon and noncombatant troops. Essentially a M1891/30 with a shortened barrel and shortened stock (the M38 is 40 inches (1,000 mm) in overall length versus 48 inches overall length for the Model 91/30), this carbine did not accept a bayonet; was in fact designed so the standard Model 91/30 bayonet would not fit it. However many M38 carbines were fitted into M44 stocks by the Soviets as a wartime expedient. M38s in the correct M38 stock command a premium over M38s in M44 pattern stocks. The M38 was replaced by the M44 carbine in 1944"

The Bad: Polymer frame has a bulge on the right hand side, next to the steel frame rail. I have been assured by CZ Inc. that it is purely cosmetic and will not affect function or reliability, since the slide and all mechanical parts ride on the steel frame embedded within the polymer. 

I originally bought this pistol for $400, planning to resell at a profit, but given the cosmetic flaw, in good conscience I'm simply wanting to recover my initial cost of $400. I've personally put about 60 rounds of various ammo through it, using both mags, and did not experience a single FTF or FTE. This is a bargain defensive/hobby pistol, shoots like a dream and I regret selling it, but like I said, it was originally supposed to be an investment.

It come as a complete package:  A two gun Ballistic carry bag, and Eotech 512 Holographic Sight, a single/double point sling, a Magpul adjustable stock with recoil pad, Back up iron sights collinear with the Eotech.  The rear iron sight is the hard to find Sig Sauer 4 position Diopter, it has a bipod mount on the lower forearm rail, (7) mags – five 30’s and two 10’s. The 10’s are great for shooting with a bipod.  There is also approximately 500 rounds of nice shiny Lake City ammo.  This gun has not been shot much.  It’s as close to new as you can get and still be used.

The Sig 556 is a gas piston action rather than the direct impingement type typically found on AR’s.  That means it doesn't get nearly as dirty, doesn't foul as easily, and can be shot much longer between cleanings.

This is a great package and it won’t last long, ………….. because you can actually shoot this one .............. it comes with ammo!

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, Melonite® coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

I just pulled it out and put it together. Model number 11707. Super hard to find in stock anywhere and soon to be banned.

NOTE:  Although this has not been specifically mentioned in any current assault weapons ban legislation, it will still be banned due to the fact that it is a currently used item by the US Marine Corps.  Current wording in pending assault weapon ban legislation states that any rifle and or shotgun that is currently used by the military shall be banned from future civilian ownership. This means that if you get one now, it will be grandfathered in. 

Now the same Benelli M4 used by the U.S. Marine Corps can be your home defense shotgun of choice. When the U.S. Marine Corps went shopping for a shotgun, they bought the M4 — the 12-gauge shotgun that functions the first time, every time. Its unique Auto Regulating Gas Operated (A.R.G.O.) system developed by Benelli engineers has dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber that operate directly against the bolt assembly.

The M4 Tactical comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a fully adjustable ghost-ring rear sight and fixed-blade front sight and a black synthetic pistol-grip style stock. With features and reliability that do it for the U.S. military, the Benelli M4 is an excellent choice for your own home defense plan.

Glock 17,  2nd Gen.  Don’t be deterred by a Generation 2.  This Glock 17 has been well taken care of and still puts the popular 9mm rounds where you want them in a hurry. Comes with Hienie SlantPro QWIK “Straight Eight” (tritium) Night Sights. Two 17 round magazines and a lockable case.  Also has an extended slide lock/release lever installed.  I've also polished the feed ramp to a mirror finish.

I bought this firearm used from a gunstore last winter.  So I cannot attest to how many rounds have been fired through it.  I've put exactly 100 rounds through the barrel. The inside of the barrel looks just as good as my New Glock 26.  The weapon functions without any problems.

I understand how difficult it is to buy a firearm without being able to see it and physically check it.
I've worked as a security contractor in Iraq and would have no problem betting my life on this firearm.

This was handed down to me and I don't need it.  Overall it looks like it was carried in the field quite a bit but shot very little.  The exterior shows a handful of small dings and scratches.  The inside is very clean.  The action opens smoothly and closes tightly.  The safety locks and unlocks the triggers fine.  I haven't fired it so I can't comment on the accuracy."

Designated with the “AM” (Anderson Manufacturing) moniker to set them apart from traditional “AR” (Armalite Rifle) models, Anderson Manufacturing rifles offer design and build quality that exceeds that of other firearms manufacturers around the world along with RF-85, a proprietary metal treatment.

Anderson Manufacturing employs a proprietary metal treatment for all its rifles that reduces friction on all the steel surfaces by 85%, resulting in a more efficient and reliable weapon. Known as RF-85 (reduce friction 85%), the treatment offers significant benefits such as faster cycle rates and cooler operating temperatures. This results in significantly less wear on the weapon, thereby increasing its life. In addition, an RF-85 treated weapon does not need any lubricants. As such, the weapon experiences fewer failures due to excess dirt and carbon fouling in the action, thereby increasing its reliability.

The rifles have a lifetime limited warranty
