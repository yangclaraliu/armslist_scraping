Its light weight (Single stack 45 ACP), easy to carry, very resistant to adverse conditions, easy to disassembly as well as maintain and it’s a “GLOCK!!”  The name speaks for its self.  Below are the specifications for the 36:  As previously stated I just bought the Glock two weeks ago so included is the original case, paper work, spent casings (date April 2012), two magazines, gun lock, pipe brush and speed loader.  I also purchased and installed two new pearce plus zero grips on the base of the magazine.  There is literally nothing you have to do to this pistol buy grab and go (very easy to carry and conceal).  I am also including a leather/kydex/Super tuckable IWB hybrid holster I purchased for it but never got to use.  This would be a great addition to anyone’s arsenal and it needs a new home….  Cash only---REDACTED)
The GLOCK 36 packs 6 rounds of .45 Auto stopping power in a package that fits the hands of most any user. In the SLIMLINE™ design, GLOCK has incorporated the use of a single stack magazine. The G36 measures only 1.13 in. in width which makes controlling recoil very simple. The G36 is easy-to-use, hard to see, and tough to face.

Bought by me 11 years ago. Rifle has approximately 2000 rounds down the pipe. Barrel is A+ as all rifling is strong,sharp and lands are still sharp. This rifle has the chromed bore option. The rifle was bought in 2001 when i was in the military and had the pinned muzzle break. Ive never wanted to ""Bubba"" this rifle so i left the break alone. It can be removed and threaded should some one want to go that route. Rifle has usual safety lever line marks, gas tube lever line marks, and knicks around the magazine well from steel mags. Rifle has NO rust OR corrosion. Has been my baby as i paid top dollar for it 11 years ago when run of the mill AK's were 300-400 a piece. 
Rifle also has the scope side rail. Rail is absolutely straight as an arrow.
 With rifle also comes
1.) a PSO scope from Russia..not the new cheap ass imports in english. All controls are in russian. Has illuminated reticle for low light shooting. i also have the bag it came from Russia in - should oyu like it as a wall hanger as i have used it as. 
2.) 2 tapco magazines that functioned flawlessly and a 75 round spring loaded drum magazine. Drum has always worked flawless. 
For 100 bucks more ill throw in the Winchester metal double rifle case this gun has lived in since 2001.

Walther PPS is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses modified Browning type locking with tilting barrel. Frame of the gun is made from impact resistant polymer. Trigger is of double action only type, striker fired, with pre-cocked striker system, similar to QA system used in Walther P99 pistols. This system requires a manual recocking (by partial slide retraction) in the case of misfire. Gun is fitted with automated trigger safety and firing pin block; additional ""storage type"" safety is provided by removable backstrap of the grip; once backstrap is removed, the firing pin is automatically decocked and gun is blocked until the backstrap is reinstalled. This patented system is called QuickSafe by Walther. Sights are low profile, with rear sight adjustable for windage."

this company. I called him up and got a quote, I will not disclose the price just  in case he was feeling nice that day he spoke to me, but I assure you that the cerakote that is much better than duracoat, I have seen duracoat prices much higher than this. So I take my 1911 frame to him in Norman where his shop is yesterday after noon july 2nd, and I got it back painted, baked and cured today july 3rd. I have never in all my years dealing with firearms or anything 
gotten that quick of a turn around time. He was very nice and had very good customer service. I have attached the pic of my MC Operator on here, I had the frame changed to dark earth. The work is solid and the paint job is amazing. When I saw my frame when I walked into his shop I wanted to jump up and down like a school girl, but being the second time meeting the dude I didnt want to get banned from future business. Anyway, give this guy a call, and again, I am writing this ONLY to share a good story and a great experience I had with harsh firearms. I am in no way connected with him at all. Just browsing the internet for a tan paint job and stumbled upon him. By the way, if he doesnt answer his phone, leave a message, he will call you back. Thanks again harsh firearms, great job."

It cost me over $1,000, I can show the bill of sale from Circlewood Gun Shop. 

Since then I have added Magpul back up sights, a red/green dot sight with magnifier that is detachable, Magpul stock, grip, and handguard, and added red letters(as you see in the pictures). 

I really want to trade for multiple firearms(ex. Pistol + Rifle With Scope + Shotgun), or something of equal value. 

*The PERFECT trade would be: An AK-47, A synthetic stock .308 w/ scope, and .45/.40(glock, taurus, s&w, Uberti .45) OR a pk380 

Remember, it is brand new. You will not find another one like it because this particular gun is hard to find. I'm fair...so you can be fair in return. Don't hesitate to offer ANYTHING!

NOTE THIS IS NOT 223/556 

AR-15 with 300 AAC Blackout barrel.  For those unfamiliar with 300 AAC Blackout, it is basically a cut down 556 case with the neck resized for a 308 bullet. It is a newer SAAMI standard. All I did was change out the barrel (CMMG), gas block and flash hider. Uses the standard AR-15 bolt and carrier and uses standard AR mags. This barrel has less than 200 rounds through it.  if you want to someday change it back to a 556, it is a piece of cake.

The rifle was originally a Busmaster Carbon 15, I added a Magpul MOE buttstock, mag grip and the new barrel. It is light as ARs go. It comes with one standard AR mag, bipod/foregrip (not shown).  I don't have the original 556 barrel.

I WILL INCLUDE THE SCOPE ( BSA 6-16X ) FOR $50 EXTRA. 

I load 110 grain Hornady VMax and get about 2200 fps. You can shoot subsonic rounds over 200 grains with a supressor (that I don't have). You can buy ammo locally at Larry's. 

 If you are a reloader, I will sell the 300 AAC Hornady die set for $35 extra.

Asking price is reduced to $475.00. but it will take $450.00 to buy a 1951 39A Marlin.  I am the second owner and need this exact amount to pay my bills and a penny less will not do it, therefore I must refuse any offer less than this.


Text in late afternoon or email me.  REDACTED in Afternoon, I will reply.

VERY Nice Used Rifle especially for the age with only 4 serial numbers.   Beautiful Black Walnut, Great bluing.

Thanks."

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many beginning shooters learn the basics of target shooting with this handy little carbine. 

This Red Dot scope is especially suitable for youngsters as they only have to place the red dot on the target and squeeze the trigger.  It can be used with both eyes open and the unlimited eye relief feature allows it to be mounted any distance from the shooter’s eyes as the shooter likes. 

We also include our popular, reversible Ruger 10/22 Picatinny rail mount with this scope kit. In the forward position it accommodates longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view. 

The smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

Full sized duty pistol. Spur Hammer, Parkerized, low profile fixed sights, improved ambidextrous safety levers, with two original parkerized 13 rd magazines and several aftermarket hi cap mags.
Checkered walnut grips and a pair of wraparound Pacmeyers.
two Leather belt holsters.
Excellent condition mechanically, some nicks and holster wear on original finish. This is a used duty pistol, if you are looking for a brand new pistol with no finish wear, this is not it.
This is the current military and law enforcement configuration, and has a black barrel. This particular gun was made in Belgium in 1985.
Buyer must have a state issued photo ID and sign a sales receipt.
The Browning Hi Power was designed by John M. Browning and he considered it an improvement over his 1911 design. It has been issued to more military forces than any other pistol in history and is still in service today. Many have argued the HP should have been the pistol we replaced the 1911 with, if we insisted on going to 9mm in the US armed forces. Controls and operation will be very familiar to the owner of a 1911 model pistol, although takedown is much simpler.
The gun in the picture is similar, but not the gun for sale.
$600 or best offer. Will consider trade. This gun is too large and heavy for my wife to carry. A smaller single stack 9mm might work better for her."

I’ve never fired either one of these and they’re still covered in cosmoline. The rifling in both appears to be very good and neither has been counter bored. Both rifles have all matching numbers except for the bayonets. The bolt has been force matched on the Izhevsk but is one of the smoothest I’ve ever felt on a Mosin.

These rifles come with the standard tool kit, 2 bayonets, 2 oil cans, 2 ammo pouches, 2 slings, and 2 stripper clips. Also included are two 440 round sealed spam cans of 7.62X54R silver tip ammunition and a can opener.

Springfield Armory 8 + 1 40 S&W/3"" Barrel/Wood Grips/Stainless Slide/Black Frame 

Springfield Armory has created the smallest, most concealable 1911 available: 
The Enhanced Micro Pistol - EMP. 
Importantly, you can't reduce the outer dimensions of a pistol without going after the inner workings, too. All together we had to re-engineer 15 different parts. What we got in the end was not just a new gun, but a new class of gun - the short-action 1911. Now that the hard part is out of the way, other gunmakers will surely copy it. But when you see their copies that look almost like a Springfield EMP, you'll say to yourself, ""Hey, that looks almost like a Springfield EMP."" It's great to be first .

Remember, it is brand new. You will not find another one like it because this particular gun is hard to find. I'm fair...so you can be fair in return. Don't hesitate to offer ANYTHING!

Mauser is a:
Mauser Modelo Argentino 1891
Deutsche Waffen - Und MunitionsFabriken
Berlin
Has the factory bent bolt handle
Shoots 7.65X53 or also called 7.65 Argentine. Rifle has been sporterized with stock refinished and bayonet lug removed. This is the much smaller Engineer Carbine that is much easier to handle and harder to find. The size reminds me of a BB gun or youth rifle, not the normal fishing pole size rifles of this era. It is factory length. It has not been drilled or tapped and retains the factory flip up rear sight. Factory sling mounts still attached.

Rare Nickel S&W model 10-5 4"" barrel .38 revolver from 1963-64. Serial #C6328xx on bottom of butt frame. It is a square butt with a N on the bottom left of the side of the frame meaning it is factory nickel. The barrel tapers toward the end with a ramped front sight. Comes with a nice set of Combat grips (shown) and some regular grips. Any weirdness in pic is reflections and shadows, revolver is uniform in appearance and nice overall condition for its age. Tight lock up on a cylinders."

Mauser is a:

Deutsche Waffen - Und MunitionsFabriken

Shoots 7.65X53 or also called 7.65 Argentine. Rifle has been sporterized with stock refinished and bayonet lug removed. This is the much smaller Engineer Carbine that is much easier to handle and harder to find. The size reminds me of a BB gun or youth rifle, not the normal fishing pole size rifles of this era. It is factory length. It has not been drilled or tapped and retains the factory flip up rear sight. Factory sling mounts still attached.

Rare Nickel S&W model 10-5 4"" barrel .38 revolver from 1963-64. Serial #C6328xx on bottom of butt frame. It is a square butt with a N on the bottom left of the side of the frame meaning it is factory nickel. The barrel tapers toward the end with a ramped front sight. Comes with a nice set of Combat grips (shown) and some regular grips. Any weirdness in pic is reflections and shadows, revolver is uniform in appearance and nice overall condition for its age. Tight lock up on a cylinders."

The Sig Sauer P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military and law enforcement professionals around the world. The innovative design of the removable steel frame housed in a polymer grip module allows agencies and units to change caliber, pistol size (subcompact, compact and full), trigger length and grip size without changing the issued serial number. The steel frame controls the rearward motion of the slide- not the polymer grip, as in other pistols. The result is both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality even with laser/light accessories mounted to the polymer grip's accessory rail.

The Rapid Response® holster is designed for maximum drawing speed without sacrificing the features required for a quality carry holster. In fact, this holster has all of the safety features of our other carry holsters including the snug custom contoured fit for positive retention and a full length thumb safety guard. The additional drawing speed is accomplished by dropping the gun just a little lower on the hip and positioning it slightly further away from the body. This allows you to very quickly acquire a full firing grip with less interference from clothing and your body.

Once you have your grip, the wide sight track eliminates friction of the sight coming out of the holster. The low-cut front lets you clear leather just above the belt line. While this holster is not quite as concealable as the Lo-Profile® or Covert Companion® it does bring the butt of the gun inward for concealability and works well for most applications. If speed is your primary concern, you need a Rapid Response®. Meets I.D.P.A. criteria.

Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability of the GLOCK pistol known throughout the world, which was demonstrated through tests and widespread use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive arguments for the F.B.I. and countless police authorities for introducing the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.

 Awesome STI Eagle 5.0 .40 S&W with BULL barrel.

Built on the patented modular steel frame with polymer grip, the Eagle delivers the traditional features of a 1911 and allows the added benefit of high capacity magazines. The innovative frame design preserves the 17"" angle of the grip in relation to the slide, original to the 1911. The essential design element for high capacity, the polymer grip, allows for double stack magazines without over-sizing the circumference of the grip, which remains comparatively the same as the circumference of a 1911.

True to 1911 tradition, This Eagle has a classic scalloped slide with front and rear cocking serrations, RED FIBER OPTIC FRONT SIGHT and STI adjustable rear sight. The Eagle comes standard with features such as a stainless steel STI hi-ride grip safety and stainless steel STI ambi-thumb safety. It has an STI stainless steel fully supported, ramped bull barrel.

I bought this for IPSC.  A turn of events and a new passion allow for the sale of this awesome pistol. I really love this pistol and I will return to IPSC as time permits...but for now I don't have the time and need to fund other equipment for my business. I feel this needs to be out runnin and gunnin instead of collecting dust in my safe. I used it for 2 matches (with Federal ammo) and it is outstanding! ( I usually shoot open class anyway, lol). I added black grip tape to the lower instead of butchering it by stippling it. So the lower is the factory STI black standard lower. The grip tape really helps on hot days! I am the second owner of this fine weapon and documentation from the gunsmiths are included in the hard case along with the factory STI manual. Brazos Custom Trigger kit is installed. Item is sold as is, all items pictured are included.

I have for sale 4 original magazines for the PSL and FPK Romanian ""Dragunovs"". These are the 10 round 7.62x54R mags and they are still in their original plastic packs that they came in.

These mags are very hard to find, as they are no longer being imported or manufactured. (Rumor has it that the arsenal in Romanian that produced these mags and rifles, was converted into an automobile manufacturing plant).

The mags are right out of my personal collection and have never been used since I bought them. They are in very good condition, however each will have a very small rust spot somewhere on the mag (see pics for condition, there is no rust on any of the feedlips).
These are not quite ""collector condition"", but more than good enough for shooting with.
