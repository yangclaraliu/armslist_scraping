I still have up for sale for just $450 a Kahr PM9 fired about 250 rounds through it and I've carried this gun inside the waistband and it works great. It shows some wear but it still in good shape. This Kahr PM9 3"" micro pistol is a pocket powerhouse with a lot going for it. Small and light, this is definitely one of the most concealable 9mm's on the market! The PM is one of the few true ""pocket pistols"" and one of the most practical carry guns available. Black polymer frame with stainless steel slide. The pistol is striker fired, and the striker is placed partially under tension when the slide is released. Low-profile NIGHT SIGHTS. This gun comes complete with TWO magazines (one 6-rd and one 7-rd w/extension), plastic case. All trades welcome all I can say is no....please no lowballs.

1. Taurus 24/7 Duo-tone in .45 acp with 2 magazines (12 rounds each) ($320) – I bought this gun new almost 2 years ago on a whim, it looked sexy and a .45.. Ive probably put less than 200 rounds through it; it has a little holster wear mostly in the form on a few light scratchers. The first hundred or so rounds fired flawlessly, the second 100 were giving me some problems with the extractor (common with Taurus) but it looks like it’s been resolved with a thorough cleaning of the extractor and not using Blazer aluminum cased ammo.

2. S&W SW9F in 9mm with 2 magazines (one 17 round and one 10 round) ($200) – I picked this one up a while ago because it was a 9mm to save some money on ammo (I’ve always been a 40 cal glock guy), but it doesn’t shoot like anything else I have, even though this is the model that Glock sued S&W over some years ago. It’s got a bit if a heavy trigger pull, but other than that, it’s a great gun. Simple and functional. 

3. Norinco/Hawk 982 ($200) – This a Chinese clone of the Remington 870 and will accept 870 parts, other than the barrel and I believe the forend may be welded on, not sure if that can be changed out. I have too many shotguns as it is and this guy gets the least use. 5+1 rounds with ghost ring sights. It has a little wear, but functions perfectly.

The gun also comes with a Marlin 10 round magazine. The gun takes any S&W model 59 or 5900 series magazines. So if you own a Smith & Wesson or other gun that takes these magazines then this would be a plus for you. 

For those buyers for whom more than a 10-round mag is legal, see my other posting of new in bag 17 round magazines that fit this gun.  

If I'm not selling this to you face to face then this firearm will only be shipped to a licensed dealer (FFL Holder) so have one picked out and squared away BEFORE you offer to buy. GunsAmerica and other websites have info of where to find FFL holders near you. 

Now for all the details for any out of state buyers ... 

I am not a gun dealer, just a private citizen so I don't know all the gun laws around the USA and a bullpup configuration may be one thing that affects the legality of this gun in your state, it is my understanding that with just a 10 round mag we are ok there but I'm not an expert on the topic ... so know the laws in your state and don't offer to buy it if you can't legally own this gun in your state. After the auction, I will be calling an FFL holder in your state prior to shipping just to make sure this gun is legal in your state, I suggest you do that before you bid. 

I accept payment via USPS money order only. Payment must be received before I ship the gun and mag. If payment is not received within 3 business days of a ""buy offer"" I will assume the buy offer was not serious and will take appropriate steps to sell my firearm to a serious buyer. 

$30 will ship it via USPS anywhere in the lower 48, Alaska and Hawaii will cost more. No sales outside the 50 United States of America.

This is generally considered the best bolt-action rifle ever mass-produced , throughout the first half of the 20th Century. The Mauser bolt action, starting in 1891 if not earlier, influenced rifle designs worldwide with its two big locking lugs up front, its spring-clip speed loading, its generally beefy construction, and numerous other features. Most modern civilian hunting rifles - Winchester's M70, Remington's M700, Ruger's M77, Savage's 110 - copy the Mauser in at least some way.
The Czech Republic, formerly Czechoslovakia, has at least a century-old tradition of making very high-quality weapons, particularly small arms (the CZ75 pistol, for example; also, the British BREN light machinegun of World War Two was little changed from an otherwise-obscure Czech design, smuggled to the Allies past Nazi occupiers)."

Brand new, sealed, still has the manufacturer's grease on it, the Taurus PT 99 AF has an adjustable sight

Refined and enhanced by Taurus to be better than the originals. The action on this gun is silky SMOOOOOTH. Bought 1 for myself, too.

Most notable is the Taurus innovation of a three position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety which allows these guns to be carried in classic DA cocked and locked mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. I'm a female leftie - the ambidextrous control is exactly where it needs to be to make it easy for me to use.

Other features include accessory rail, three dot micrometer adjustable low profile sights, and the Taurus Security System.

""Hodgdon® Powder Company and Hornady® Manufacturing have teamed together to answer the frequently asked reloading question; ""Can I buy the powder used in Hornady LEVERevolution factory ammunition?"" Yes, this is the same spherical propellant used in Hornady's innovative and award winning high performance factory ammunition. This fabulous propellant meters flawlessly and makes lever action cartridges like the 30-30 Winchester yield velocities in excess of 100 fps over any published handloads, with even greater gains over factory ammunition. Other cartridges include the 35 Remington, 308 Marlin Express, 338 Marlin Express and the 25-35 Winchester. The list of cartridges and bullets is limited with this highly specialized powder, but where it works, it really works!"""

The 84f introduced the ""combat"" trigger guard with a squared-off front that allows for a finger hold, plastic grips, a proprietary ""Bruniton"" finish, a chrome-plated barrel and chamber, and replaced the safety with a ambidextrous decocker, which lowers the hammer when operated. As a result, these pistols cannot be ""cocked and locked"" and a reversable magazine release for left handers.
This model is chambered for the .380 ACP (9 mm Short) cartridge. 
The 84f has a double stacked magazine with 13 round capacity and has a 3.8"" barrel.
Cheetah pistols feature an open slide design that increases the reliability of the firearm. 
The frame is made from an aluminum alloy that delivers the strength and durability of steel, but with 65% less weight. 
Features such as these, and the built in reliability and quality, make the Cheetah a natural for personal defense and an ideal back up pistol for law enforcement professionals."

The M91/30 is a Tula arsenal numbers-matching rifle which looks almost new.  Very little sign of having been issued.  I've only shot 10 rounds of Prvi Partizan (non-corrosive) through it.  It is one of the seldom seen Mosins with orange rear sight numbers. Very nice rifle.

The M44 is an uncommon variant built in Romania and it has a very smooth action.  Passes the bullet test with flying colors.  I've only shot 10 rounds of Prvi Partizan (non-corrosive) through it.  The numbers do not match but it is a sweet little carbine.

They come with a little more than 720 rounds of 7.62x54r ammunition.  I also have a 20 round box of non-corrosive Prvi Partizan ammo that will go with the rifles.  There are 6 stripper clips, clip pouches, a tool kit, oil bottles and slings.

You can get an M31/90 at the gun show or online for $100.  You can get an M44 online for no less than $190 nowadays (when you can still find them).  The cheapest 7.62x54r ammo you can buy is @$80 for 440 rounds.  I'm offering all for $290.  What a deal."

Description,
New for 2011 from SIG SAUER (www.sigsauer.com) is the P238 Special Edition Rainbow Titanium finish pistol with Rosewood Grips. The P238 is a sub-compact (5.5"" long) .380 that weighs only 15.2 ounces with a six round magazine. It is one of the smallest .380's available and the Rainbow's mirror polished titanium slide finish makes it unique. It looks like titanium jewelry and shoots like, well, a SIG. It may well be the ultimate in an all-metal frame, concealed carry pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy, beavertail style frame with rosewood grips for comfort and a secure hold. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Rainbow Titanium finish and SigLite Night Sights.

This SIG SAUER P238 Rainbow is supplied in a very nice, padded hard case with instructions, gunlock, a polymer holster and a single six round magazine. Spare magazines carry a 2010 MSRP of $44. At present, there is not a ""plus one"" or ""plus two"" magazine option with a pinky finger rest, which is a pity. Such a magazine would make holding and shooting the P238 more comfortable, as it has a ""two finger"" length grip.

Included with the pistol is a simple, but functional, molded polymer holster. This right hand holster clips over the belt to the waistband of trousers and is worn externally. It holds the P238 by means of screw tension, which can be adjusted by means of an Allan-head bolt. This simple holster holds the pistol securely at the wearer's side, yet allows for a speedy draw. Worn behind the right hip and covered by a light jacket, such as a poplin windbreaker, it is quite inconspicuous. It can also be worn cross-draw in the spleen position. Unfortunately for left-handed shooters, it is not ambidextrous, but it is great for everyone else.

The Owner's Manual is so larded with safety warnings that it is difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. Apparently, you should not buy a gun and, if you do, you should not handle it. Actually shooting a firearm is so dangerous that it should not be attempted. Keep your pistol locked away where no one can reach it. Ho, hum.

SIG currently offers eleven variations of the P238, differing mostly in finish and minor features. The basic, all flat-black Nitron model starts at $629 and other models sell for as much as $749 (the Tactical Laser model, which comes with a laser sight). The Rainbow Titanium, along with most other P238's sporting wood grips, carries a 2010 MSRP of $699. Other P238 models have been readily available, but the Special Edition Rainbow Titanium has been in short supply since it was announced. It was not until August 2010 that we finally received a sample for review. Fortunately, it was worth the wait. From a practical point of view, this pistol should be largely impervious to its environment due to its titanium-plated, stainless steel slide and hard-anodized aluminum alloy frame. One might think that a pistol this pretty would not be so durable, but it is. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the Special Edition Rainbow Titanium looks like jewelry. Not just the slide, but all of the visible steel parts are mirror polished and titanium plated. These include the Allan head grip screws, safety lever, take down/slide stop lever and magazine release button.

Unlike the previous fixed barrel, blowback action, DA/SA P230 and P232 .380 pistols, the P238 is a single action (SA), short recoil operated (tip barrel), autoloading pistol with an exposed hammer. In grip angle, silhouette and most other respects, it is a miniature 1911 Government Model pistol. Unlike most .380 pistols of any brand, it is a locked-breech design, not blowback operated. The locked breech design of the P238 makes it easier to rack the slide than with blowback pistols, which require a very heavy slide return spring to augment the inertia of the slide and keep it closed long enough for the bullet to leave the chamber. There is a Colt Series 80 type firing pin block that prevents movement of the firing pin (and thus discharging the pistol) unless the trigger is pulled rearward. The rear of the chamber is wedged against the face of the slide to lock the pistol closed, much as with a Glock pistol and unlike the barrel lugs used in 1911 pistols.

This is a conventional SA pistol, despite its exotic and colorful Titanium finish. The P238 reminds us of the discontinued Colt .380 Mustang Pocketlite that it closely resembles, which was also a short recoil operated, locked breech, SA sub-compact. The word is that SIG SAUER purchased the rights and the machinery to produce the Mustang (as the P238) from Colt. The P238's external slide contours are SIG, but its frame is shaped almost identically to the Mustang and most of the internal parts appear to be interchangeable. The operation of the P238 should also seem familiar to any fan of the Colt Mustang. It works the same way and the control layout is the same. It also takes down like a Colt Mustang. The P238's ejector is a pivoting type pinned to the left inside of the frame; when reassembling the pistol after takedown, depress the ejector as you run the slide assembly back on its rails.

There are three safety features. The first is a manual thumb safety. This disconnects the trigger and, if the hammer is down, prevents the hammer from being cocked or the slide opened. Apply the thumb safety with the hammer at full cock and the hammer cannot be lowered, but the slide can be operated; very handy for unloading a pistol carried ""cocked and locked"" (condition one).

The second safety device is an automatic firing pin block. This prevents the firing pin from moving forward unless the trigger is pulled rearward. (Pulling the trigger disengages the firing pin block.) It serves as a drop safety and might prevent an accidental discharge (AD) should the manual safety malfunction on a pistol carried ""cocked and locked.""

The third safety feature is a half-cock hammer notch. This is intended to catch the hammer should it slip when being manually cocked or lowered, as long as the trigger is not simultaneously pulled rearward. Using the half-cock hammer notch is NOT a safe carry method, as pulling the trigger will drop the hammer from its half-cock notch.

There is no grip safety or magazine disconnect safety on the P238. It will fire with the magazine removed or if gripped improperly, as long as there is a cartridge in the chamber and the trigger is pulled. Most shooters dislike these types of safeties and feel they are redundant. Real gun safety, of course, is between the shooter's ears.

The aluminum trigger of our test pistol released at a very heavy 8.5 pounds after a long, two-stage take-up. This is totally unacceptable for a SA pistol, whose primary reason for existence is supposed to be a short, light, clean trigger pull. The P238's trigger is clearly inferior to several staff owned Baikal IJ-70 (Makarov) .380 pistols that cost a fraction of the price of the P238. It is way inferior to the 4.4 pound SA trigger pull of contemporary SIG P232 .380 pistols. The P238 trigger is a disgrace and should be rectified immediately. Before we would consider using this pistol for serious self-defense/concealed carry, it will require a trigger job.

The P238's sights, on the other hand, are excellent. They are high visibility, Patridge type, three dot, tritium night sights. These sights are the best we have ever encountered on a sub-compact pistol, as good as the sights on SIG full size service pistols. For once, a manufacturer did not scrimp on a .380 pocket pistol's sights.

The .380 ACP (9x17mm) cartridge is considered a powerful stopper in Europe, where it has a long history as a police service cartridge, but a mouse gun cartridge in the U.S. The reality is somewhere between, but in this case the Europeans are closer to reality. Certainly, the 9mm Luger (9x19mm) cartridge can launch a heavier bullet of the same diameter somewhat faster and the .38 Super or .357 SIG are faster yet. All of these exceed the maximum stopping power of the .380 ACP, given JHP bullets of similar terminal performance. On the other hand, modern .380 loads using JHP bullets like the Federal Hydra-Shok deliver serious stopping power, similar to a .38 Special snub-nose revolver with similar JHP bullets. Thus, .380 pistols are certainly not mouse guns. Nobody in their right mind would want to be shot by a .38 Special revolver or a .380 ACP pistol, no matter how much they might belittle their stopping power! In their extensive stopping power study, Marshal and Sanow found that the Federal 95 grain JHP .380 factory load delivered about 65% one shot stops, compared to 64% one shot stops for the Federal 125 grain JHP .38 Spec. factory load fired from a 2"" barrel revolver. To illustrate how important it is to choose a bullet that expands reliably, the (non-expanding) Federal 230 grain FMJ .45 ACP load delivered 64% one shot stops (mostly from a 5"" barrel), virtually identical to the short barreled .38 snubby and .380 Auto with JHP ammunition!

Since the P238 is intended for concealed carry, how it is carried deserves comment. Like other traditional SA semi-automatics, there are three possible carry modes for the SIG P238:

    Condition One is ""cocked and locked."" This means both the magazine and chamber are loaded, the hammer is cocked and the thumb safety is ON. To shoot the pistol, just push the safety down to the ""FIRE"" position and pull the trigger. Fast and it takes only one hand to accomplish, but you are relying primarily on the manual safety to prevent an accidental discharge and we have seen manual safeties malfunction and shooters muff their operation under stress. The P238 does have a firing pin block, which helps to prevent AD's if you keep your finger off the trigger until the moment you intend to shoot.
    Condition Two is fully loaded (both magazine and chamber) with the hammer down on the loaded chamber. The thumb safety is always OFF, but the firing pin does not touch the primer and the firing pin safety prevents its doing so, even if the pistol is dropped. To shoot the pistol, manually cock the hammer and pull the trigger. Both actions can be performed by the shooting hand, but the hammer is small and the hand cannot assume a shooting grip until after the hammer is manually cocked. There is a half-cock hammer notch to catch the hammer if it slips, as long as the trigger is not pulled at the time.
    Condition Three is loaded magazine, but empty chamber. The thumb safety is always OFF. To shoot the pistol the slide must first be racked to chamber a cartridge, then the trigger pulled. This is the safest method of carry and the method specified by the U.S. Army for the 1911 pistol carried in the full-flap military holster, but it takes two hands and you may not have both hands free during a sudden, life and death emergency. Also racking the slide requires some hand strength and there is the possibility of short stroking the slide, failing to chamber a cartridge. In that event, you get a click instead of a bang when you pull the trigger and, in all likelihood, you are dead a second later. (Tip: carrying a Condition Three pistol with the hammer in the full cock position is completely safe, since the chamber is empty, and makes cycling the slide easier.)

None of these alternatives is ideal and all have advantages and disadvantages, so the intended condition of carry should be carefully considered by any potential P238 purchaser. SIG's other current .380 pistol, the DA/SA SIG P232, can be carried hammer down in complete safety yet fired simply by pulling the trigger. (There is no manual safety on the P232 to manipulate--and possibly flub--in an emergency). The P238 is smaller, lighter and easier to carry than the P232, but all three SA auto carry modes compromise either safety, simplicity, or speed. There is no ""correct"" carry mode for a single action autoloader. Choose the mode that suits you best.

For our test shooting with the P238, we journeyed to the Izaak Walton gun range south of Eugene, Oregon. This outdoor facility has covered shooting positions with bench rests and target stands at 25, 50, 100 and 200 yards. With the sub-compact SIG P238, we conducted our test shooting at 25 yards, our standard range for pistol testing. The western Oregon summer weather was partly cloudy, with a high of about 75-degrees F. and 10-15 MPH winds. Nice pistol shooting weather!

For test ammunition we used Remington/UMC 95 grain FMJ (955 fps), Winchester/USA 95 grain FMJ (955 fps), Blazer 88 grain JHP (1000 fps) and Federal Premium Personal Protection 90 grain Hydra-Shok JHP (1000 fps) factory loads. We shot five-shot groups for record at 25 yards using a Pistol Perch rest. Guns and Shooting Online staff members Jim Fleck, Robert Fleck, Gordon Landers and Chuck Hawks did the test shooting.

Shooting Results

    Federal 90 grain Hydra-Shok JHP - smallest group 1-3/4"", largest group 3"", mean average group size = 2.5""
    Blazer 88 grain JHP - smallest group 4-3/8"", largest group 7-5/8"", mean average group size = 5.5""
    Remington/UMC 95 grain FMJ - smallest group 3"", largest group 7-1/8"", mean average group size = 5.7""
    Winchester/USA 95 grain FMJ - smallest group 5-1/4"", largest group 7-1/4"", mean average group size = 6.6""

This time out, Jim shot the smallest group. We were pleased that the P238 did its best work with the Federal Premium Personal Protection 90 grain Hydra-Shok load, as this is the load we would choose for concealed carry.

The primers of the fired cases that we inspected evidenced a light firing pin blow, but there were no malfunctions from this. The P238 fired first time, every time the hammer dropped.

Unfortunately, the super heavy trigger made a mockery of our attempt to shoot the little P238 for accuracy. It is impossible to consistently shoot decent groups or explore a pistol's accuracy potential when the trigger pull is nine times the weight of the gun itself! The lighter the gun, the lighter the trigger pull should be. All shooters felt that with a decent trigger pull, the P238 would deliver much better groups and the occasional good group we fired tended to confirm that thinking. Unfortunately, because of the terrible trigger, the practical accuracy of the P238 is unacceptable and all three shooters had tender trigger fingers from the super heavy pull by the end of the test shooting. The wear on trigger fingers was accellerated by the sharp longitudinal grooves cut into the face of the trigger. We'd like to see a smooth trigger in this pistol.

Our staff gunsmith, Rocky Hays, is going to see what he can do to lighten the P238's trigger pull. We have ordered a reduced force mainspring from Wolff springs (the P238 uses the same springs as the Colt Mustang). The sear engagement notch on our test pistol seems smooth and clean, so it is unlikely that much would be gained by honing these engagement surfaces.

While we are on the subject of springs, the necessarily small recoil spring in the P238 (after all, the effective length of the recoil spring guide rod is only 1-7/8""), takes an unavoidable beating during operation and SIG recommends it be replaced every 1500 rounds. Some owners have reported recoil spring life as short as about 500 rounds. Either way, that is a considerable amount of shooting with a .380 pocket pistol, so recoil springs are unlikely to become a serious financial drain. SIG offers P238 replacement spring packs and Wolff sells both standard rate and heavy duty recoil springs for the Colt Mustang/SIG P238.

We had two malfunctions in the course of our test shooting. Both were failures to feed that resulted from the slide locking open. In both cases, the fired case was ejected cleanly. This happened once with the Federal Premium Hydra-Shok load with Chuck shooting and once with the Winchester FMJ load with Gordon shooting. We were unable to determine the cause of these malfunctions. We suspected that, as the pistol recoiled, the shooter had accidentally bumped the slide stop upward with his thumb. We did our test shooting with a two-handed grip and the shooter's thumbs wound-up positioned directly under the slide stop. It is, after all, a very small gun.

For comparison, we had an all stainless steel Walther PPK at the range. (There is a review of the PPK on the ""Handgun Articles and Reviews"" index page of the Handgun Information Page.) It was interesting that, although the P238 is smaller and lighter than the PPK, it also (subjectively) kicked less. We attribute that to its locked-breech action; the Walther is a blowback action. On the other hand, the Walther had a much better SA trigger pull and a fixed barrel and it easily out shot the P238 in the accuracy department. In terms of recoil, though, the little SIG is a comparatively pleasant gun to shoot.

Everyone on the Guns and Shooting Online staff was favorably impressed by the little P238 Rainbow Titanium. It is not perfect, but with a trigger job, it will be very nice and there was an immediate rush to claim first dibs for personal purchase of the pistol after completion of this review. We cannot think of a better recommendation than that. For certain, it isn't going back to our friends at SIG SAUER!"

This Llama is a 1911/Government style pistol, with ribbed top slide with fixed front sight & rear sights. Serrated front strap and matching serrations on main spring housing (straight line, not checkering), It has a grip safety and a thumb safety.

It's stainless steel slide (marked as ""chrome"" on the box) and frame show some wear, due to normal use. Comes with the Llama factory black grips, which have cracks and probably need to be replaced. It accepts standard 1911 grips, available almost anywhere. There are 2 Mags (9rd capacity) included with this pistol. One is junk, the other is a Springfield mag, which mates up perfectly. This pistol accepts all 9mm 1911 magazines. I have the original box as well. 

This pistol was purchased new in the early to mid 90s by my father, and has spent the vast majority of it's life in a gun cabinet. If I had to make a guess, I'd say it has 500-700 rounds put through it over it's lifetime.  I stripped it down after taking the attached pictures, and gave it a good cleaning. The bore is bright and shiny, and the weapon function checked flawlessly.  I put two mags of FMJ through it, and it went bang every time.

Similar and Identical pistols are on gunbroker for anywhere from 300-400 dollars, plus you have to pay shipping and FFL Fee. I'm asking 250 bucks for it. I will require a NC Pistol Purchase Permit, or a NC Concealed Carry License from the purchaser in order to abide by state law. 

Nine One Zero Five Four Five Four Six Four Eight for questions or pictures.

Am not interested in trades. The asking price of $250 bucks is firm. I am in no rush to sell, and am not hurting for cash, so please, no low-ballers.  If it doesn't sell on here, then I'll go through the hassle of listing it on Gunbroker and ask a lot more for it come January.  

Due to the high volume of folks calling and asking me to break the law, please note once again, NO CCP/PISTOL PURCHASE PERMIT MEANS I WON'T SELL TO YOU!!!  I will however, hold the pistol for a serious buyer for a small deposit while the permit is obtained.  

Thanks, hope to hear from you."

This design incorporates many features, which have been desired and specified by users who prefer this highly effective tool, over any other. The MAKORA's spring remains in an ""at rest"" position at all times except when deployed. With no fatigue on the compressed spring when the knife is not in use, this gives the users the reliability and confidence that when the release is pushed, the knife will operate. Other features include: quick and efficient one handed open and close action, S30V premium steel double edge blade, a pocket clip, and tamper resistant screws.

I bought this gem less than a year ago, I didn't shoot it much, less than 100 rounds. It's in great condition. For those not familiar with the P238, due to it's small size and larger caliber, it's a favorite for concealed carry.
The set also includes night sights, case, Israeli made clip holster, lock and paperwork. 
The aftermarket grips are a high quality synthetic ivory. The pictures indicate white grips but they are more of a light ivory. Also included are the factory grips that came with it. I will take $450 or best offer.

It has never been fired and has been modified by Jim Milks of innovative custom guns (EGW's ex-gunsmith).
Unlike other springfield 1911's the RO has a match one piece barrel and the gun is hand fitted from the factory. The only flaws on the gun is a little bit of holster wear and some slight discoloring on the dust cover from ICG's welding the dawson rail (barely noticeable unless you look hard). Also, there are some marks from the x300 adapter on the dust cover. It has been properly lubed and maintained. No rust anywhere.

Comes with:
-The gun of course
-two factory mags (with kimber bumper pads)
-original packaging with warranty card and paperwork
-factory holster and mag pouch
-blackhawk serpa holster (like new)
-galco yaqui holster (like new)
-comp tac dual adjustable mag pouches (like new)
Modifications:
-Grip tape on the front strap
-Harrison fixed lpa sights with tritium inserts (installed)
-dawson .160 height tritium front sight (installed)
-wolffe extra power firing pin spring
-Ed brown hardcore firing pin
-dawson rail (discontinued by dawson and its super hard to find, it was drilled and welded by innovative custom guns)
*surefire x300 rail adapter included (modified by ICG for a snug fit on the x300)

If you're wondering why its never been fired its because I was injured not long after I bought the range officer. I don't like to fire my guns until I'm done modifying them to the way I like it. My injury is preventing me from getting the funding to finish the project. I've had the gun since late may and it has only been carried. Plus, the gun is already parkerized so its ready to be cerakoted, duracoated or whatever you want to coat it with. I paid $1440 total including gunsmithing so the price is fair.

Email me for more pictures (armslist has a picture size limit) or you can meet me for a look at the gun. You can see proof that it has never been fondled, dropped or fired. Please provide ID an CPL to prove that you CAN own a gun."

These were only built from 1981-1987. This is a semi-automatic rifle, and is the deluxe model of the 742's/7400's. Gun is the BDL model, solid walnut stock and forearm, cheekpiece, iron sights, high rise see-thru scope mounts, and topped with a brand new Bushnell Trophy 4 X 12 X 40 scope, just sighted in. Gun is in (my estimate) 90-95% condition, and my estimates are usually conservative. This rifle functiond flawlessly. I have put approximately two boxes thru it since I got it with no jamming whatsoever. I really like this rifle, probably as nice a gun as I have ever owned, but I am having shoulder/neck problems and need something with less recoil. Would consider trades of equal value, trades plus cash, or multiple guns on trade. I will e-mail pics if you are interested, or you have something I am interested in. I would consider driving to meet for the right deal."

I bought this for mule deer hunting out west. I used it twice and was completely happy with it. I'm just not using it anymore. It has a very powerful 1200 yard range and is extremely accurate. Has Leica superb optical quality with a 7x magnification and can be used as a monocular. This rangefinder was built for a lifetime of serious hunting. Whatever is in the little red box will be ranged and the distance will be given on the screen along side the object. It also has a scan feature so you can have it constantly checking the distance of objects as you switch from one to another just by holding down the button. Please see the pics below. I took all 4 of them with my phone. Just to show you how it looks, I took one through the rangefinder at a tree in the back yard. I paid $529 plus tx for this brand new at Scheels Sporting Goods in the Fox River Mall a couple years ago. I am asking $295.

For those of you familiar with Mosin Nagant's, the hexagonal receiver was only in production for the first few years and there are fewer of them and therefore more sought after than the common round receiver type.  Also this rifle is from the Tula arsenal in Russia not the Izhevsk arsenal where most of the M91/30's around seem to be from.  Gun comes with sling, tool kit and bayonet.
