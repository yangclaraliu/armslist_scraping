This pistol is buttery smooth and everything is tight.  There is absolutely ZERO endshake so you know that there hasn't been a lot of rounds down the pipe.

I give this pistol a 98%+ condition.  This is definitely a hunter....get ready for this season!  This is also a ""pre-lock"" pistol which means there is no integral locking mechanism.

I'm looking for a 1911 type pistol or concealed carry with cash for trade, I might consider others as well...let me know what you have!

Made in 1947, this blue semi auto .22 has a 4 1/2"" bull barrel, adj. sights, full sized checkered walnut grips and an exposed hammer (so you don't drop the firing pin against steel when you clean it and put it away). The bore is perfect but the blue shows some wear on the front & back straps and at the muzzle from a holster. The pistol has been used but well cared for, AND IT IS 65 YEARS OLD! Yes, you can buy a new plinker for less, but this goes back to the days when high quality workmanship and materials meant something. This classic pistol will hold it's value while that new plinker depreciates to it's true value and MAYBE the new one will work as it goes down. Do you ever wonder why there are SO MANY ""LIKE NEW"" SEMI AUTOS FOR SALE??? Sorry, I can't do pictures. NO TRADES, SHIPPING, OR OFFERS. LOCAL CASH SALE ONLY TO OHIO RESIDENT.

It is for sale for $500 obo, but I'm mainly/also looking to trade for a Quality AR-15 ( Bushmaster, Rock River, Etc ), looking for them just Stock so I can put my own modifications/accessories on them, or ill look at certain ones that have accessories/modifications already done! 

I DO have some money to add with the SR9 and everything for the right, quality, AR-15.


If you have a Trade Offer, or Cash Offer or would like to see some pictures of the SR9, or want to talk about a deal, etc, please text me at REDACTED. If you cant text for whatever reason, you can email me at REDACTED, (It will just be a little longer process to workout a deal. Text messaging is always a quicker, better way of working out a deal and receiving offers, that and I dont check my email too much).


Must be 21 to trade for the SR9 or buy the SR9, and show a Valid Ohio Driver's License.


Thanks for reading,

See trading section below;

I would like to sell my .40 cal. Sig Sauer 2022 PRO. It has 45 rounds shot through it in an indoor range ONLY. The gun is immaculate, the sole reason for the sale is due to my wifes discomfort at the muzzle flip the .40 cal produces - that was a deal breaker for her, fair enough.

Besides impeccable cleaning and lubrication and cleaning, there have been no FTF, FTE and the firearm has only been used by seasoned adults at its one range outing.

EXTRAS: Factory Sig Nite Sights (Extremely bright!), A custom CrossBreed SuperTuck holster for the right hand, a FOBUS tension holster for the right hand, ONE factory Sig Sauer Magazine, a speed loader, and a FOBUS two-slot belt affixed magazine carrier, and the factory Sig Sauer hard carrying case. And, last but not least, a Hoppes #9 .40 cal. cleaning kit.All extras are included in the price.

The trades I spoke of can come in either 9mm or .45ACP ONLY in the form of a Glock 17 or 19, and of the CZ 75 line, any reasonable (RIA, Springfield, low end Kimber, etc.) 1911. S&W M&P. If you're offering more gun than I'm trading, I can gladly meet in the middle with cash.





I'd like to sell to someone near to Capitol Hill - as I do not drive, unless you come out to meet me. I also require valid WA state identification and strongly prefer a CCW.

That’s when Samuel Colt began production of a revolving-cylinder pistol at his Paterson, New Jersey, factory. The firearm was enthusiastically received by the Rangers of the newly independent Republic of Texas. And in 1844, the single actions made history when sixteen Rangers held off eighty Comanche warriors with their new Colt revolvers.
One of those Rangers was Sam Walker. So in 1846, when war with Mexico was looming and Walker’s Mounted Rifles needed powerful handguns for action on horseback, Walker ordered 1,000 improved Colt revolvers. The Walker model held 60 grains of black powder and chambered six, .44-caliber balls. The massive fire-power needed a much stronger frame and a larger design than earlier models. The Walkers were 15-3/4"" long and weighed nearly four and a half pounds. The reputation of the formidable Walker black powder firearms ensured Colt’s success.

The Walker I am offering (not pictured) has the catch installed on the lever so it doesn’t  flop down.  It is unused, but no box or paperwork.  I’ll include a powder flask and a box o .451 ball, and an Uncle Mikes holster.  You can get it new from Cabela’s for $399.00, I’m asking $299.00.  Will consider trades."

I'm selling it for 1000.00 today only bc ill be taking it to the store to sell about 1 o'clock and they said thed give me 850 for it and sell it for 1600.00 so if you've been looking for this gun or a competition ready from the factory weapon then this would be the day to act.. you can save 600. + + on this today! I'm going up there about 1 I can't hold it or anything I have to do this today.  Its loaded from the factory with wilson combat main spring and mag well, 

The Operator is an all forged steel pistol. They come standard with Novak 3 dot night sights, Pachmayr grips, ambidextrous thumb safeties as well as a match barrel, match bushing and match grade aluminum trigger. Slide serrations are front and rear. The Armory Kote finish with olive drab frame and black slide looks really sharp.

There is one feature or rather lack of one I like. The Operator uses a GI recoil plug and spring guide rather than a full length guiderod. At least in my opinion the full length guiderod adds nothing useful to a 1911 but they have become popular. Kudos to Springfield for leaving it off. I believe this might have been a request from the military during the design phase.

They come packed in a hard shell blue case with two 7 round magazines included.

Specifications Caliber .45 ACP Capacity 7 rounds Finish Olive Drab/Black Armory Kote Frame / Slide Forged Steel Grip Pachmayr Wraparound Barrel 5” Stainless Steel Match Grade and Bushing Overall Length 8.5"" Weight 42 oz. (empty magazine) Sights Fixed Low Profile Combat Rear, Dovetail Trigger Long Aluminum Match Grade, 5 - 6 lbs. Recoil System GI Style Guide Rod MSRP $1,487

Handling the Operator is straightforward and differs little from any other 1911. I noticed when I fired my first magazine the recoil was lighter than a non-railed 1911. Since the rail system is mounted under the front of the frame most of that extra weight is where it will do the most good in reducing recoil.

While the trigger pull is listed at between 5 and 6 pounds I found it to be 5.5 pounds and crisp. The trigger can also be adjusted for takeup. This one needed no adjustment and was fine as it came from the factory. The thumb safeties operate easily with a firm engagement in both positions.

This gun is in good condition as you can see in the pictures.  This was purchased in an estate sale and I would prefer to let some one with interest in these style of guns to enjoy it as opposed to myself, where it would continue to be a safe-queen.  With that said, I researched GunBroker and Gunsamerica.com to see what 1887 were going for and see a range of 900-1800.  Many of the high-end auctions are in similar and/or worse condition.  Being that I have no need for this, I am willing to part with it on the lower end of that scale.  The serial number dates its production in 1888, as seen in the several pictured examples.

The Pro Hunter rifle features a swing hammer safety that allows for easy access to the hammer spur, the speed breech quick release breech plug that can be easily removed by rotating it only 90 degrees, the Pro Hunter extractor that can be rotated left or right for easy access to the speed breech, the quick load accurizor which allows the hunter to quickly load their rifle by incorporating a false muzzle design, and the TC power rod to allow for a more uniform load by applying the same seating pressure shot after shot.

It appears to have never been fired, but I purchased it from a previous owner so I can't verify that.

I would rate this gun at 97%.  There are two small imperfections in the finish.  One is on the frame right above the trigger guard, and the other is on the end of the slide.  They apperar to have been bumped around in storage.  See pictures, contact me if you would like additional pics.

The price is negotiable, but I am not looking for trades at this time.  I would prefer a ftf, but will ship (legally) if the buyer pays shipping."
