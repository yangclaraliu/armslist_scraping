55,http://www.armslist.com/posts/202055,For Trade:  Springfield Armory M1 Garand,"Savannh Area, Savannah, Georgia",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, September 29, 2011",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Putting this out as a feeler... 

Up for trade only is a SA M1 Garand. It shoots great (tears up a 2 liter Coke bottle at 100 yards with Greek surplus), but I can't bring myself to do anything other than stair at it due to the historical importance. This gun, judging by serial numbers and parts, definitely saw action in World War II and Korea.  Gun is in great shape with a conservative 85% finish.

Though it's a service gun, it is ALL Springfield Armory from what I can tell. Stock was refinished or replaced at some point (no cartouches), but appears to have the original wood on top of the barrel. The lack of cartouches is common on replacement stocks sent abroad. Rifling is still good, but the barrel was counterbored at some point due to what was probably a dinged up muzzle crown (thus improving accuracy). This was commonly done to these rifles by civilians when they were as cheap and readily available as Mosin Nagants. 

Bullet still sits in the muzzle with the proper 1/16""+ gap between bullet and brass. Again, this is a tack driver for a 67 year old gun with a 59 year old barrel!

Receiver: SA (January 1944)
Bolt: SA (Revision 19 [Post November 1944])
Barrel: SA (December 1952)
Trigger Guard: SA (Type 1 [Pre 1944])
Op Rod: SA (Post WWII production [Older ones cracked after repeated use. Probably put in when rebarreled])

WHAT YOU GET: Gun will come with period correct sling, rifle case, and 192 rounds of Greek HPX on enbloc clips in bandoleers WITH THE CARDBOARD in an ammo can.

TRADE VALUE: $900
This gun is gorgeous and would be worth far more if the economy was better. They don't make these anymore folks, and finding a surplus gun in this shape with all SA parts is uncommon!"

I am trying to trade out some an air compressor with some finish nailers for a decent pistol.  May also consider paying cash but really would prefer to do a trade, stuff is like new.

Porter Cable C3151-1 Job Boss 4.5 Gallon 1.6HP 150 PSI Portable Air Compressor that has seen very little use, the air compressor was bought in 2009 and used 3 times on 2 different occasions to install some trim and for a small framing project. It is missing the padding around the main handle area but that is the ONLY thing wrong with it (dog chewed it off the second day I owned it, he was a puppy). It has large wheels to allow it to be rolled and an extendable handle for easy rolling (locks into place kind of like a rolling suit case). Regulator and connector panel can be removed and ""extended"" using an air hose to allow control of the compressor remotely (awesome for framing and roofing jobs).  I paid $360 for it, it is a factory refurbished model that I bought directly from porter cable, and I have had no problems with it. 

Also have 2 Rigid finish nailers, one 16 ga and one 18 ga.  18 ga uses up to 2-1/8"" brads, 16 ga uses up to 2-1/2"" brads, cost $100 each new.

I will trade all of the listed items above for a decent .22lr pistol.

It comes with the factory box, a left hand holster(if you are left hand), .44 mag/.44 special Lee carbide dies(if you reload), 50 rounds of light loads, and about 150 rounds of ""full house"" loads. This is a lot of extras to go along with a perfect condition Ruger. Add it up, holster($20), 4 piece carbide dies($40), and over $100 in ammo!

I have here an UNFIRED, first production run, pre-ban TEC-9. This includes ALL of the original manufacturer accessories that were offered AND THREE 30 round mags and 1 20 ROUND MAG

Let me reiterate - this gun is UNFIRED. It is beautiful and immaculate. It includes all of the accessories included ONLY with the pre-ban model.

This is a one of a kind deal - I challenge anyone to find an unfired pre-ban TEC-9 of this quality for as low a price as this, let alone one with the original accessories eliminated after the ban.

It was imported to the US by PW Arms.  I purchased it on January 27, 2004, and have cared for it meticulously since then, cleaning it thoroughly and lubricating it lightly after every shooting session.  I estimate I have put 450 rounds through it.  The pictures tell the story of the condition.  Note the discreet importer's mark above the grip on the right side, instead of the billboard placard on the slide so common with most Bulgarian Makarovs.  The bore is mirror bright and rifling is sharp.  Slide and frame serial numbers match.  High resolution pictures are available on request.

This pistol comes with everything with which it was imported -- the original cardboard box and wrapping paper (serial number on box matches pistol), standard issue red military grips, black thumbrest grips, and two Bulgarian 8 round magazines.

These military pistols did not come with an owners manual, but Century Arms created and published a simple one.  To see an electronic copy of the CAI manual, go here:  http://stevespages.com/pdf/makarov.pdf.

I have a target Kimber conversion in silver. It has the target sights as well as the front and rear cocking serrations. These are very nice conversions that shoot very well. It has had a barrel extension professionally added and then threaded 1/2-28 concentric to the bore for use with a suppressor. The smith that did the work fired several magazines and it was 100% reliable with no baffle strikes. It is very straight thread job because my can has .234"" baffles and bullets pass through those baffles without issue. Most commercial suppressors use a .25"" or large baffle so this conversion will work without any worry of baffle strikes.

Round count is in the 300 round range total. It is by far the most accurate 22 pistol I have ever shot, with or without the suppressor. This conversion is 100% reliable with all bulk and supersonic ammo as well as with certain subsonics. The barrel is short enough that most bulk remains subsonic as well. 

I am asking $375 shipped to teh lower 48. The conversion itself costs over $300.

Why some scopes lose their zeros and some don't?
 Rule #1 is: In order for a scope to lose its zero, something between the reticle and the target must move.
 Rule #2 is: In order to see what moved you need two reticles, each one to track the other.


The old type German scopes put the cross hair in the front focal plane. They hardly ever lost their zeros because the only thing between the reticle and the cross hair was the objective lens. The drawback was that the reticle magnified when zoomed and blocked out long-range targets. Americans put the reticle in the rear focal plane where it would not magnify. The main drawback with this was that it put about three more lenses between the reticle and the target. The American system was then three times more likely to lose its zero. The American was more convenient but the German system was more reliable.

Shepherd Rifle Scope gives you the best of both worlds with the drawbacks of neither. Sheperd uses the front focal plane location for rangefinding and bullet drop compensating circles. This gives Shepperd Scope the German dependability and, when zoomed, the circles do not block the targets but instead frame them and give you instant target engagement on any power. Then put the cross hair in the rearfocal plane (where the Americans do) in order to get the benefits of a nonmagnifying reticle. This patented Dual Reticle System lets each reticle monitor the other and thus allows for: one shot zeroing in, ""at a glance"" verification of the original zero, and visual confirmation of windage and elevation adjustments before you shoot. The Shepherd is truly the most reliable of all and the only one to tell you if something is out of zero before you shoot."

Brand new with one magazine is around $200.  Don't miss out on a great deal.  Thank you for looking

The handle is cracked and chipped, but otherwise it is in firing condition. I was only able to find one other of these for sale online and it was in similar condition. This is a great item for the Vintage / Antique gun collector or WWII / Military collector. Here is some more info: Webley & Scott produced a number of single-shot, break open signal flare gun devices used by Commonwealth Military Forces during the First and Second World Wars. Perhaps the most prolific of these was the No.1 MkIII, produced in 1918 at the company's Birmingham facility. A variant, differing only in its use of black plastic grip panels instead of the earlier wood, was produced by Colonial Sugar Refinery in Sydney, Australia in 1942. The pistols can often be seen in films, notably Lawrence of Arabia, where the title character discharges one to signal the beginning of an attack on a disabled enemy train, and The Empire Strikes Back where bounty hunter Boba Fett is seen carrying one as a rifle.

The DPMS LR-308 Semi Auto Sniper System (SASS) was born of military necessity. US Military Snipers and marksmen overseas found themselves rapidly switching from scenarios involving precision long range shooting one moment, to close, violent encounters where they were at a disadvantage due to the low ammunition capacity and slow rate of fire of their bolt action rifles. The Government sought a solution to this problem...The DPMS SASS is the answer.

With an 18” fluted bull barrel, free floating 4 rail hand-guards, and JP adjustable Trigger, it is capable of sub-MOA accuracy at long range, fulfilling its role as a precision rifle. The 19 + 1 ammunition capacity and semi auto fire control group ensure the shooter is never outgunned, and allows for faster follow up shots. The Magpul PRS stock (new for 2008, previous models feature a VLTOR modstock), Panther Flash hider, DPMS Mangonel back up iron sights, and A3 receiver, complete the package.

The very best. Kimber CDP - Custom Defense Package - pistols combine the most popular carry features into a package that gives them their name. Adding these features while the pistols are being built in the Custom Shop reduces their price by over $500 and gives them their incredible value.

CDP pistols are made entirely in the Kimber Custom Shop. Standard features include low-profile three dot (green) night sights and a Carry Bevel treatment that rounds and blends edges so they cannot snag on clothing or holsters.

CDP pistols are chambered in the powerful .45 ACP, what many consider the finest cartridge ever developed for law enforcement and personal defense. The Ultra CDP II is also available in 9mm.

CDP pistols have it all. Night sights, ambidextrous thumb safety and 30 lines-per-inch checkering on the front strap and under the trigger guard. Match grade barrel, stainless steel slide and double diamond rosewood grips.

The Ultra CDP II with a 3-inch barrel is available in 9mm as well.

Not to mention it was my first gun reviewed for the site. It was literally broke in, sighted in then cleaned and put away where it's been since.

Here's the cost breakdown of everything new before tax:

Rifle - $300
3 Die Set - $30
2 boxes Hornady 58 grain moly custom varmint - $45
1 box Federal 100 grain soft point - $20
100 new unprimed brass - $20
1 box 100 ct Hornady 58 grain Vmax - $25
1 box 100 ct Nosler 70 grain Ballistic - $25
Savage rail bases - $10
Medium Height Rings - $15
Total - $490

There's a total of 10 rounds of the Federal left and 18 rounds of the Hornady left and all used brass is included. 30 rounds were loaded early on as a load test and never fired so there are 90 Nosler bullets left and 80 Hornady bullets left, and in turn the 70 new unprimed brass. The only thing not included in this setup that you see pictured is the Nikon Prostaff scope. 

Total cost AFTER tax was over $525, blah blah blah. Bottom line, I'm asking $400 for everything pictured (minus the Nikon) and for an extra $25 have a decent Simmons 8 Point 3-9x40 scope (bottom half of second picture) for a total of $425. Rifle comes with original box too. The rifle is PERFECT. If I had told you I hadn't shot it you would believe me, but there are approximately 22 rounds through it.
