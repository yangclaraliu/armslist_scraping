I want this gun off  because my older son is kind of crazy,i dont want him to toy with it anymore and that's why i am selling it cheap       This Winchester Model 61 hosts the 24"" round blued barrel, magazine tube, walnut stock and forearm, open sights, slide action and all in the famous .22 S, L, LR caliber. The serial number of 60223 indicates a production date of 1944. This transition period Winchester has the rare and valuable tang sight. This is an excellent Pre-64 Winchester with the original picture box and paperwork. This Winchester is in near mint condition. The bluing is excellent with deep bluing remaining and very little handling marks. There is some very slight bluing loss at the slide but otherwise the bluing is near perfect. The wood is in excellent condition with no cracks, no chips, no breaks, no splits and no major gouges. The wood only shows a few very minor handling marks. There are no extra holes drilled in this Winchester anywhere. The bore is clean and bright with crisp rifling grooves and well defined lands. The proof marks and barrel stampings are crisp. This Winchester is clean, original and complete. This is one of the nicest Model 61 rifles I have seen. It is in pristine condition. The rare picture box is also in excellent condition. The box shows some minor storage wear and stains but is solid and intact. The box is complete with a very good readable label, inner packaging and all the paperwork. The paperwork includes the brochure, the hang tag, the Model 61 booklet and the original targets that came in the box. All the paperwork is in excellent condition. This is a very rare opportunity to own a complete pre-64 Winchester package complete with the matching picture box and paperwork. This Model 61 is as nice as they come. This Winchester is in fantastic condition and will be an excellent investment. This Winchester will only increase in value if well cared for as it has been. I have provided many photos to let the photos do the talking.   Peace."

With 50% more HEAVY DUTY receiver that also has double reinforcement and crowned with extra heavy duty Target like barrel ! A true comparison is with the Russian tiger Draganov.Having made a reputation for accuracy,This heavy duty Barrel not found on most other rifles has Chrome lined chamber and Bore. This Vepr system along with excellent quality of all parts, to many to list here, has earned a legendary reputation for total dependability from the jungles to Siberia ! Vepr Comes with 1 US 30 round magazine, cleaning rod , cleaning . This barrel length is 16.5'' inches. Has scope rail on left side of receiver for mounting telescopic scopes or holographic sights on a picatiney rails. The rifle will take most in spec hi cap AK mags & drums.

Veprs are built for extreme demands above and beyond all others with extra heavy duty receiver, extra heavy duty reinforcment each side and an extra heavy hammer forged chrome lined target like barrel. The combination of years of proven design with attention to detail has produced legendary dependability and legendary accuracy from the jungles to Siberia!

Bolt of the Vepr models in 7.62x39 caliber are fitted with two locking lugs.

Enhanced against weather and mechanical wear the cartridge chamber, barrel bore, gas cylinder, and bolt- support rod are chrome lined.

A vepr goes through a thorough inspection process at every part, every step of building and must pass the final thorough examination by a quality control committee before any vepr ever leaves the arsenal.

Why the Vepr is better than the average AK

Hammer-Forged, Chrome-Lined, Heavy Barrel. Most durable AK Barrels Made.

Hammer Forging is a process whereby the lands and grooves of the barrel are formed by hammering the barrel material against a mandrel. This process not only creates sharp and well defined lands and grooves but also leaves an excellent surface finish on said surfaces. An additional benefit is that the barrel material becomes work hardened. The chrome plating helps prevent against wear and corrosion. We don't believe you can buy a better barrel on any rifle.

Rifles based on Kalashnikov's operating system have not been known for their exceptional accuracy. The renowned AK47 rifle was designed to function flawlessly in all environments and temperatures. In other words, functionability was more important than accuracy. However, because the VEPR has a stiffer receiver than the AK47, better accuracy can be expected.

Most Accurate. Consistently better groups than other AKs.

True RPK Receiver. Stiffer and longer wearing than any other AK receiver. Made for Soviet Squad Automatic Weapon.

The VEPR costs more for a reason - It is simply the finest Kalashnikov based rifle available in the U.S. market

Will work with most In Spec Hi Capacity AK 47 Mags & drums ."

It is manufactured with the same pride of workmanship than the Polytech Legend and the excellent shotguns the Chinese make.

Not looking to sell unless I'm blown away by an offer. Looking to trade for multiple firearms +/- cash. Trade value on this is probably around $1500. Im not forced to move this rifle quickly, I just have several AR's and this is the one picked to go. Will ignore all ignorant and lowball offers. I will delete this ad when sold/traded. Don't get your feelings hurt if I'm not interested in your trade. I don't sell to minors or felons either so don't bother. Thanks for looking."

This hefty pistol is often mistaken for a Desert Eagle. It is sturdy, heavy and will take anything you feed it. It was brought over in 90-91 in two calibers; .45 and 10mm. 10mm is my ver favorite cartridge. It is the granddaddy of the 40 S&W. It has an interesting history. After the disastrous 1986 Miami FBI/bank robber shootout 2 criminals were involved in a car chase after an FBI stake out team spotted the criminals at the same time the crooks made them. Two FBI cars eventually managed to stop the duo in a residential neighborhood and a furious gun battle ensued. I believe there were 4 to 5 agents armed with .38 Specials and shotguns and were immediately engaged. The gunman ay the wheel took a 12 gauge blast to the chest making the odds 5 to 1. The lone bank robber, however also wounded opened a withering fire with a mini-14. One agent immediately went down, dead. Two other agents were badly wounded. At this point the shooter received a fatal wound to the chest cavity, but kept shooting and maneuvering. Keeping up a volley of fire another agent went down. A wounded agent, slumped agaist a tree, fired a round of buckshot, dropping the motally wounded. All five agents were dead abd grievously wounded by a man who was mortally wounded.
This event, actually tragedy, caused the FBI to commission a study of what went so horribly wrong. They surmised that even a mortally wounded man, in fact an Army Special Forces veteran, had the motivation and the firepoweer to take down an entire FBI team. The .36 Special revolver was woefully underpowered, in fact boucing off car windshields. The shotguns were unwieldy in the confines of a car. 
A new cartridge was necessary and Smith and Wesson decided to use a cartridge already already available in what was to be the failure called the 10mm   for the ill fated Bren Ten. After Smith & Wesson came out with some large handguns chambered with for the new 10mm cartridge. Soon, however, complaints inundated field offices that the 10mm was unmanageable due to its recoil. It actually was not the recoil but female and slighly built male agents could not handle the .41 magnum like recoil. Smith and Wesson, not wanting to lose the contract, necked the 10mm brass down a few millimeters, called it the .49 S&W and a Phoenix rose from the ashes: the 40 S&W, which is used nationwide by LEO's and recereational users alike. Today the 10mm is still chambered by guns made by Glock, Kimber, Colt, and EAA's the Witness. This round can be used for hunting and is a one shot, one kill round. The Megastar is, according to my experience, near indestructible. I have loaded rounds that would cause a Glock or Colt to explode but the Megastar digests it easily. Mo trades, price firm!"

It's in excellent condition. Very light wear. Metal is in great shape with one very small blemish on one of the barrels (hidden under forearm) and the standard wear marks from the underside of the removable forearm. The wood is also in very nice shape with some minor nicks from use you would find on any 30 year old used shotgun. No cracks and has the original buttplate.

This is the model with the straight (English) stock and the single selective trigger. It has 26"" barrels. Barrels are modified and IC. Based on the serial number and some information I found on Browning's website I think this gun was made in 1977. I am the second owner and have had it since 1995.

For those not familiar with these guns...Browning made the BSS from the late 70s until they discontinued them in 1988. They're boxlocks with blued, engraved receivers and solid raised ribs. They're excellent guns and a real value in my opinion.

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future."

Yesterday, New York State introduced the most restrictive gun ban in US history. Even if you already own any semi-automatic gun -- ""assault"" rifle, handgun, ANYTHING -- you are required to register each and every weapon, and TURN IN ALL MAGAZINES with a capacity of more than seven (7) rounds! ALL sales, personal or otherwise, of ALL ""assault"" weapons have been banned -- outright. You can NOT sell your AR, AK, SKS, Mini 14/30, to anyone else. Period. Handguns will not be allowed to have more than seven rounds.

Now, that's ""only"" New York -- but no longer. Today, at about noon time, our Dear Leader is going to announce an executive order that will be effective immediately ""regulating"" our Second Amendment rights into the pages of history. Much of what will be contained in this order will be similar to the New York bill.

In NY, many ""Conservatives"" were on board with this legislation because they thought it was political suicide to vote against it. 

In short, unless / until this goes to the Supreme Court **and** is roundly defeated you and I are looking at a total ban, and the real possibility that Federal Law will prohibit even the ownership of any hi-cap mags and possibly even the weapons themselves. At least with the 1994 ban, you could buy and sell personally. The 2013 ban may eliminate that entirely.

Moral of this story:  Get what you can now, hide it and keep it to yourselves. Join a group that supports your rights, donate liberally, and GET OFF YOUR DAMN ASS AND DO SOMETHING!!!"

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future."

Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us.

This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.

The AK-47 is a selective-fire, gas-operated 7.62×39mm assault rifle, first developed in the USSR by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is officially known as Avtomat Kalashnikova (Russian: Автомат Калашникова). It is also known as a Kalashnikov, an ""AK"", or in Russian slang, Kalash.

Design work on the AK-47 began in the last year of World War II (1945). After the war in 1946, the AK-46 was presented for official military trials. In 1947 the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the Soviet Army. An early development of the design was the AKS (S—Skladnoy or ""folding""), which was equipped with an underfolding metal shoulder stock. In 1949, the AK-47 was officially accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces and used by the majority of the member states of the Warsaw Pact.

The original AK-47 was one of the first true ""assault rifles"" to be manufactured, after the original Sturmgewehr 44.[8][9] Even after six decades the model and its variants remain the most widely used and popular assault rifles in the world because of their durability, low production cost, and ease of use. It has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as irregular forces worldwide. The AK-47 was the basis for developing many other types of individual and crew-served firearms. More AK-type rifles have been produced than all other assault rifles combined.[3]

History
Design

The Germans were the first to pioneer the assault rifle concept, during World War II, based upon research that showed that most firefights happen within 400 meters and that contemporary rifles were overpowered for most small-arms combat.[10][11][12][13] The Germans sought to develop a select-fire intermediate powered rifle combining the firepower of a submachine gun with the accuracy and range of a rifle.[10][11][12][13] This was done by shortening the standard 7.92×57mm cartridge to 7.92×33mm and giving it a lighter 125 grain bullet, that limited range but allowed for more controllable automatic fire.[10][11][12][13] The result was the Sturmgewehr 44.[10][11][12][13]

Like the Germans, the Soviets were influenced by experience showing most combat happens within 400 meters and that their soldiers were consistently outgunned by heavily armed German troops, especially those armed with the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifles.[14][15] The Soviets were so impressed with the Sturmgewehr 44, that after World War II, they held a design competition to develop an assault rifle of their own.[16][17] The winner was the AK-47.[12]

Mikhail Kalashnikov began his career as a weapon designer while in a hospital after he was shot in the shoulder during the Battle of Bryansk.[18] After tinkering with a submachine gun design, he entered a competition for a new weapon that would chamber the 7.62x41mm cartridge developed by Elisarov and Semin in 1943 (the 7.62x41mm cartridge predated the current 7.62×39mm M1943). A particular requirement of the competition was the reliability of the firearm in the muddy, wet, and frozen conditions of the Soviet front line. Kalashnikov designed a carbine, strongly influenced by the American M1 Garand, that lost out to the Simonov design (scaled down PTRS-41), that later became the SKS semi-automatic carbine. At the same time, the Soviet Army was interested in developing a true assault rifle employing a shortened M1943 round. The first such weapon was presented by Sudayev in 1944, but trials found it to be too heavy.[19] A new design competition was held two years later where Kalashnikov and his design team submitted an entry. It was a gas-operated rifle which had a breech-block mechanism similar to his 1944 carbine, and a curved 30-round magazine.

Kalashnikov's rifles (codenamed AK-1 and −2) proved to be reliable and the weapon was accepted to second round of competition along with designs by A.A Demetev and F. Bulkin. In late 1946, as the rifles were being tested, one of Kalashnikov's assistants, Aleksandr Zaytsev, suggested a major redesign of AK-1, particularly to improve reliability. At first, Kalashnikov was reluctant, given that their rifle had already fared better than its competitors. Eventually, however, Zaytsev managed to persuade Kalashnikov. The new rifle was produced for a second round of firing tests and field trials. There, Kalashnikov assault rifle model 1947 proved to be simple and reliable under a wide range of conditions with convenient handling characteristics. Production began on 6 July 1947,[20] and in 1949 it was adopted by the Soviet Army as ""7.62mm Kalashnikov assault rifle (AK)"".[21]

The AK-47 is best described as a hybrid of previous rifle technology innovations: the trigger, double locking lugs and unlocking raceway of the M1 Garand/M1 carbine,[22] the safety mechanism of the John Browning designed Remington Model 8 rifle,[23] and the gas system and layout of the Sturmgewehr 44. Kalashnikov's team had access to all of these weapons and had no need to ""reinvent the wheel"",[24][25] though he denied that his design was based on the German Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle.[26] Kalashnikov himself observed: ""A lot of Russian Army soldiers ask me how one can become a constructor, and how new weaponry is designed. These are very difficult questions. Each designer seems to have his own paths, his own successes and failures. But one thing is clear: before attempting to create something new, it is vital to have a good appreciation of everything that already exists in this field. I myself have had many experiences confirming this to be so.""[27]

There are claims about Kalashnikov copying other designs, like Bulgina's Tkb-415[28] or Simonov's AVS-31[29] In a History Channel special about the AK-47, an interviewer asked Mikhail Kalashnikov if he had been influenced by the Sturmgewehr 44 design at all. Kalashnikov became very irate and angrily refuted the idea that the Sturmgewehr 44 design had been an influence on him in any way whatsoever; however, it is known that Kalashnikov's team had direct access to examples of the Sturmgewehr 44.

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future."

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future."

 I bought this Crossbow thinking it would be a nice pastime activity for me in the back yard.  I took it out of the box and put it together … actually cocked it once and pulled the trigger accidentally without a bolt on it.  There was no damage except some fraying of the string.  Some time later it was in the way so I took it apart, put it back in the Styrofoam package, boxed it up and put it away.  In the 3 or 4 moves in the years since then it ended up staying packed away till I came across it the other day.  It is just as I bought it except the paperwork that came with it wasn’t there, I don’t know where it got off to but it is gone. (The bow is shown of the front of the box with “optional scope” that did not come with it.)
  I know I’m not going to use it so thought I’d see if anyone else would like it.  I purchased it on Oct 8, 1990 … I still have the receipt and the price tag is on the box.  Total purchase price w/ tax was $143.37 … I’m asking about half that for it.

See below for guns I'm willing to take as partial trade or make an offer for multiple guns on my list and maybe we can work something out for the full package.

I recently found out that due to a miscommunication with the store, they did not reduce my asking price to $800 as I instructed at that time, even though that was what I listed in my previous posting.  I have since spoken with them and made it clear that my asking price is now $800 cash.  If you'd like to see the gun or handle it in person you can find it at Todd's Guns.

The winchester model BD trap is in 96% with ALL original finish on both the bluing and wood. Back checking on winchester's serial database the gun apparently was produced in Mid-1928. Making this gun 85 years old making the condition of this gun fairly remarkable and i don't honestly believe you will find another EVER. But as far as the gun itself goes it is spotless the only ""flaw"" we could really find is the lack of the box. Even the magazine tube area which contacts your slide has barely exhibited signs of wear. Now with this being said the gun did belong to a serious collector so the condition doesn't come to much of a surprise. Now i will be more than happy to provide more pictures as I am sure there will be a demand for them. So if you want to add this Winchester to your collection i suggest NOW is the time because once it is gone you are almost guaranteed to never find another in this shape. We are a Licensed FFL and CAN ship on a buyers dime if need be. Contact at 1-REDACTED (my name is darryn) or email as prompted. Thanks alot for your interest again folks.

Most civilians cannot buy it, and if you do find someone selling it, chances are it's all nasty with sweat stains, or very old and dilapidated. I hand select all of my vests, and being a foreign and domestic law enforcement instructor and combat veteran I know what I'm doing.

I stock LEVEL II concealable armor in sizes for just about everyone, even kids. THIS IS LEVEL II ARMOR, NOT IIA, NOT III. I tell all customers how to care for the vests, options for use (vehicle armoring, backpack, and where to get carrier options for cheap if I can't get them. I've sold several dozen sets with no complaints and a few return customers.

I am easy to work a deal with, and accept trades of all kinds (ammo, decent firearms, gear, etc). I like to think I'm paying it forward by helping keep people and their families safe, and preparing for the worst, especially in this day in age.

I normally do NOT ship or deal outside of Indiana or the surrounding counties of Marion, but if you want to ship on your dime, that's fine. Don't waste both our time asking a bunch of questions and then tell me you live in Texas, I'm not selling to people I can't meet face to face. I am available via cell phone anytime, just email me your number. Thanks for your time, and God bless America."

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF THE CONVERSION KIT: 

1. ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK OEM sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.
