ROMAINIAN CIVIL GUARD MILITARY AK RIFLES ARE THE MOST ORIGINAL ROMAINIAN
AK RIFLE VARIATION AVAILABLE TODAY. UNLIKE THE WASR-10 AK VARIATIONS
WHICH ARE BASICALLY BUILT FOR CIVILIAN EXPORT, THESE WERE RIFLES
ORIGINALLY DISIGNATED FOR THE MILITARY BUT DISASSEMBLED AND SOLD AS
PARTS TO THE U.S. WHEN THE ROMAINIANS ADOPTED THE 5.45 CALIBER. THE KITS
USED FOR THESE BUILDS HAVE VIRTUALLY NO WEAR AND REALLY NICE BORES.
THESE G CODE RIFLES ARE ASSEMBLED ON ORIGINAL HI-CAP U.S. MADE SEMI-AUTO
RECEIVERS MANUFACTURED BY NODAK. THESE RECEIVERS ARE ORIGINAL FACTORY
HI-CAPS AND HAVE THE DIMPLES FOR ADDED STRENGTH AND MAG SUPPORT ABOVE
THE MAG WELLS. THEY ARE MUCH LIKE THE SAR-1 VARIATIONS WHICH ARE NO
LONGER IMPORTABLE. EACH RIFLE FEATURES A TAPCO U.S. MADE G-2 TRIGGER
SET, THESE TRIGGER SETS HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
NODAKS RECOMMENDATIONS TO INSURE SURE FIRE, NO FAULT PERFORMANCE. ALSO
FEATURES A U.S MADE TAPCO GAS PISTON, AND U.S. MADE 45% COMPENSATOR.
THESE COMPENSATORS ARE ALSO MADE BY TAPCO AND ARE DESIGNED SO THAT THEY
CAN BE LOCKED INTO THE EFFECTIVE POSITION FOR EITHER THE RIGHT HANDED OR
LEFT HANDED SHOOTER. TO ME THESE ARE THE NICEST AND CLOSEST TO A TRUE
ORIGINAL ROMAINIAN AK-47 RIFLE AVAILABLE. EACH RIFLE IS EXPERTLY
ASSEMBLED AND QUALITY CHECKED TO INSURE PROPER MAG FIT, PERFECT SIGHT
RADIUS, ETC. THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN FEED AND FUNCTION TESTED. AS WITH
EVERYTHING WE SELL YOUR SATISFACTION IS GUARANTEED.
BY POPULAR DEMAND, THIS RIFLES INCORPORATES THE ORIGINAL VERTICAL
FOREGRIP. THESE RIFLES ARE WELL MATCHED, HISTORICALLY CORRECT, AND LOOK
GREAT. LEGALLY ACCEPTS ALL HI-CAP MAGS AND DRUMS REGARDLESS OF COUNTRY
OF ORIGIN."

I can tell you from personal experience that they are comparable to Eotechs at about half to a third of the price. Constructed around an aluminum frame, they are durable and sport a nice crisp sight picture. All in one unit, no need for an additional mounting bracket. They take one AAA battery and will last for a stated 1000 hours.

""Why compromise? With the HD7 you don't have to. At LUCID we recognize that no two shooting situations are the same. Your red dot should be able to provide functional feature benefits to assist in most situations. The HD7 has been designed from the ground up to be a strong, reliable optic that offers the shooter features and benefits that exceed the market standards at a price that is friendly to the wallet.

Since it's introduction, the HD7 has been very well received by many recreational, competition shooters as well as many law enforcement and military personnel. The HD7 is a solid alternative to other much higher priced optics on the market today.""

This is a great item for the Vintage / Antique gun collector or WWII / Military collector. Here is some more info: Webley & Scott produced a number of single-shot, break open signal flare gun devices used by Commonwealth Military Forces during the First and Second World Wars. Perhaps the most prolific of these was the No.1 MkIII, produced in 1918 at the company's Birmingham facility. A variant, differing only in its use of black plastic grip panels instead of the earlier wood, was produced by Colonial Sugar Refinery in Sydney, Australia in 1942.

Stock is possibly an Overton replacement stock, but I am not 100% sure. Rear (lower) handguard is birch and front (upper) looks to possibly be beech, but matches very well. Stock and handguards have been refinished using an aged oil technique (boiled linseed oil and alcohol based dye). The rear handguard had a small hairline crack that was properly repaired with epoxy (not wood glue), and has a U shaped notch in the front portion that fits under the barrel band. I am assuming the notch was either made for accurracy purposes or as a quick repair. The notch is not visible when the handguard is installed. All metal is included and is in good condition with the exception of the stock ferrule. It has been removed and installed on another stock. Lock up was average on my rifle and I purchased a magnetic shim kit to get the tight lock up that I was looking for. The magnetic shims are included with the stock. 

Only selling due to the fact that I recently picked up two complete HRA and SA stock sets and replaced the refinished birch stock on my rifle with an original GI stock.

Up for sale is a really nice Mosin Nagant M44 carbine.  This is a more rare peice as it is from the Hungarian arsenal, made in 1953.  This is not the 're-aresenaled' or rebuilt Mosin M44's you see today.

The metal on a Hungarian Mosin is fantastic as the milling is superb.  The barrel is excellent with a lot of rifling left.  I have refinished the stock in a red oak finish.  All numbers are matching.

The wood on these Hungarian Mosins is Elm.  Elm is harder than the typical Birch you find on a Mosin, and the edges are smooth, not sharp.

I'm asking $225.  Let me know if you have any questions!

Internals/metal are in good shape. Bolt functions like it should, and there has been no cutting or bubba type shenanigans anywhere. This gun is stock.
The wood has some dings in it, but they're minor and could be cleaned up if someone was so inclined. I didn't want to alter this rifle in any way, so I haven't tried.

These were made in the 50's and 60's by Egypt using machines that originally made the Swedish AG-42, which is similar in action but a different caliber.
These rifles were some of the first direct impingement battle rifles. Only 70,000 or so were ever made, and of that only a couple thousand were imported into the US. They have an adjustable gas system, excellent muzzle break, and are fed by 10 round detachable box magazines.

The bore is PRISTINE and it shoots straight as an arrow. Took it out recently and put about 60 rounds of Yugo FMJ through it and it ran flawlessly.
Have a couple boxes of ammo still on clips to go with it.

This is a US military training rifle in 22LR with production dates between 1984-1986.

The general characteristics of the 541X include a medium weight 27” barrel (bolt face to muzzle), that features a recessed (.020”) target-style crown.  The barrel is .810” in diameter at the muzzle.  The 541X is a clip fed bolt action rifle.  The plastic clip holds 6 rounds.  Although it looks fairly conventional, the action of this rifle is somewhat unusual for American rifles in that it is a rear lockup bolt action rifle.  The bolt also has dual extractors.  Distinctive markings on the barrel include 541X Target stamped at the top center of barrel and some proof marks on the barrel just forward of the receiver.  Markings on the receiver include the serial number and “US” stamped just above the serial number.

For high volume, dirt cheap practice or plinking with a centerfire pistol, few accessories are as useful or cost effective as a 22 rimfire conversion kit. This Tactical Solutions kit is a finely crafted, drop-in slide replacement for America's favorite sidearm, the Model 1911. Engineered to fit Government or Commander sized frames, these machined steel units come complete with a 4.5"" barrel, firing pin overtravel stop, adjustable sights, integral full-length optic rail and 10-round aluminum magazine. Installed on the pistol's frame, this conversion kit maintains the feel and profile of its centerfire counterpart, providing the user with a familiar grip angle and operating controls for economical, yet useful and realistic practice. The kit is compatible with single-stack or STI wide-body frame designs with the appropriate magazine inserted. The 10-round magazines lock the slide to the rear when depleted, a unique attribute that is often overlooked on rimfire conversions."

The pistol comes with a 30-round and 15-round magazine, and has had a trigger tuneup including a lighter spring from a member on the ar15.com forum.  The factory trigger was quite stiff, but now it's MUCH better.  The difference is like that between a S&W Sigma and a stock 1911.

DTI 16"" upper - WILL SELL UPPER ALONE FOR $400
M4 feed ramps and M203 cuts on the barrel. It has an ""F"" marked front sight base. The barrel has been magnetically particle inspected. The extractor spring has been upgraded and has the black center insert.  Barrel is 1:9 Chrome moly. It will shoot both 5.56 and .223. I have added a carbine length Magpul MOE hand guard and rear flip-up sight. 

PlumCrazy composite lower - I didn't really know what to think about these until I tried one out, now I really believe they're the best deal going for a lower. Saves about 8oz over a traditional (half a pound!) and comes with a nice 4lb trigger that is creep free and a clean break and reset. Makes for a great lightweight AR that has exceptionally nice handling.

I have a Taurus PT145 Mil Pro with the picatinny rail on it. Great pistol, just too small for my hands.

I can throw in a Black & Decker industrial heavy duty sander/angle grinder for the right deal.  Its a great tool and extremely strong, I just have no use for it. I mean it is heavy duty with a 7"" disc.  I'd say it's worth about $150 or so. That's what I see it sell for in dirtier condition than mine.

If I value the pistol at $350 (kind of an average value), and the value of the angle grinder, that's $500 to $550 worth.  Any takers?  I will also throw in any other discs I have to fit it. Email me for pics.

So altogether, and not counting the shipping charges I paid, I’ve got just over $1900.00 in this rifle. I honestly can’t tell you how many hours I spent putting this together, finding & ordering stuff (plus S&H charges), but it was well worth effort because of how it came out. I don’t even want to guess what you’d pay to have one built even close to this, although I showed it to an employee at a local gun shop and they thought I must have $3000 to $3500 in it. I originally intended to put in a 20” heavy 6.8 SPC barrel and try some 500 to 600 yard stuff with it, but even with a crappy 3x9 40mm scope I have put mil-surp 5.56 on paper at just over 400 meters as it is. It’s definitely been used, but way less than 500 rounds, and except for a few scuffs and dinks, it’s in great shape. I wouldn’t hesitate to carry this rifle into any situation and stake my life and family on it. It comes just as you see it, with a black nylon Bulldog case, two Magpul 20 round PMAGs (with pull assists & covers), and a set of UTG rubber rail covers too (never got around to getting green ones since I was gonna use a YHM smooth forearm on the 6.8 and wouldn’t need any), a sling, plus a bag of original parts & spares, the manual & paperwork, etc. Show me an ID, hand me the cash, pick up some ammo on the way and you’ll be good for the range.

Please feel free to ask questions, and I do have more pictures, but make me an offer. It’s gotta go, so seriously it’s “Or Best Offer”, I’d rather do it here and not fool with shipping on some other site. Email is OK, but I prefer you call or text REDACTED. You really gotta see this one. Thanks, Tommy"

The flagship feature of the Jimenez Arms LC380 is its easy to use massive screw adjustable rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation. Other, higher priced, pistols do not offer this kind of flexibility. The high visibility front sight is another great feature which adds to a highly effective sight pattern. These features coupled with a last round slide hold open makes this pistol uncommonly accurate and a delight at the range.

The XD is Single Action. The trigger, once all safeties have been disengaged, drops the sear.. which allows the fully cocked firing pin to release, striking the primer and making the ""BANG"" sound that puts a hole in something down range.

Unlike the Glock, which when the trigger is pulled, the last 1/3 of the trigger pull actually cocks the pistol.."

It is CNC machined from 6061 & 7071 Aircraft grade aluminum and Mil-spec Type III hard-coated. It has a built-in full length picatinney rail mount with a side-swivel breach loading design, a push-button breach lock, and a one-piece tube & grip. It can fire all 5 3/4"" USCG munitions and can be mounted on most 7"" or longer rails.

http://www.spikestactical.com/new/z/st-9-side-loading-havoc-launcher-p-397.html

Included in the sale is a military issue M203 grenade flip-up leaf sight and picatinney friction-lock rail mount. The sight itself can also be removed from the mount and attached directly to most standard hand guards. It is used by looking through the erected leaf and indexing it with the rifle’s front sight post or flip-up type sight.

Although I haven’t used this one, I have fired M203’s and other 37mm’s and they are a real blast. This one’s just a much more modern and functional design. There are adapters available to fire 26.5mm “marine” flares as well as 12 gauge stuff as well. The sight is almost impossible to find at any price, but will come in handy if you actually want to know where the rounds going, something the 37mm guys never mention for some reason???
