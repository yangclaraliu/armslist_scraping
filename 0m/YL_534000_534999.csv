This is a K-frame(midsize) revolver based on the Model 19 Combat Magnum but produced in stainless steel. When the Model 19 came out it was called the ""the answer to a peace officer's dream"" by Bill Jordan, a well-known border patrol officer and exhibition shooter. The reason for this was its powerful cartridge combined with easier handling over the larger N-frames and excellent accuracy and reliability.  It comes with the stock small grips as well as large right-handed shooter target grips. The gun features the classic white-outline adjustable rear sight with the orange-insert front. It is wonderfully accurate and will shoot less expensive(and less powerful) .38 Specials in addition to the .357. The price is somewhat negotiable and I'm also interested in partial trades for an 870 shotgun or '67-72 Chevy pickup parts. Buyer must have a permit to purchase and will get a bill of sale."

It is $4599 on the Leupold website and thats without the Leupold IMS Integral Mounting System or the Leupold Alumina flip up lens covers(The mount and caps are worth 450 alone).

The price for the scope with the Leupold IMS mount, the Leupold Alumina flip up caps and the boxes is $3350. If you want to trade just send me an offer. 

This scope is truly revolutionary and versatile. It has locking turrets, first focal plane, the best magnification range, the best quality glass and illumination system (can be used in broad daylight!!), excellent construction, Quick Change bullet drop turret rings.  It came setup for a military .308 round and is precisely dialed in for it's drop. I then purchased 2 more Quick Change rings for 55 grain 5.56 and 77 grain 5.56 rounds. The rings will be included with this scope. So, you could buy this one Super quality piece of glass and use it on any .308 and 5.56 gun. It's an awesome setup. Very easy to take on and off with the IMS mount and it will hold zero like a champ


I am looking to trade for a LaRue PredatAR or OBR in 5.56 or 7.62. I would also consider LWRC rifles and a few others. They will need to have optics or cash on top

BPS. A solid steel reputation for durability and dependability. Few firearms ever earn the level of respect the Browning BPS boasts. The BPS has a solid reputation for long-lasting durability and an uncanny ability to keep on working in spite of what Mother Nature does to stop it. This shouldn't come as a surprise because the BPS has what most other pump shotguns don't - features like rigid dual machined steel action bars, a forged and machined steel receiver, a convenient top-tang safety and bottom ejection for ambidextrous operation, and legendary Browning balance and handling. That's why the BPS continues to be the pump shotgun serious shotgunners like you can always rely on.

Bottom ejection throws empty shells straight down, out of the line of sight, and makes the BPS the ultimate pump for right- or left-handed shooters. Bottom loading provides operating convenience.

The proven pump-action design of the BPS is sound and reliable. All components are durably constructed of solid steel and are housed inside a receiver machined from a solid block of forged steel. Rigid double slide bars are made from heat-treated steel and eliminate twisting and binding for faster, more efficient operation. The result is smooth operation in all conditions and the ability to stay on target while delivering rapid follow-up shots. A convenient serrated slide release is located at the rear of the trigger guard.

The thumb-operated, top-tang safety on the BPS can be easily operated by right- and left-handed shooters alike, even with gloved fingers.

.410 bore BPS shotguns include the Standard Invector™ system."

Magazine holds six 2 3/4"" twelve gauge shells and barrel is threaded to accept a variety of screw on chokes for various applications.  There are no screw on chokes included with this gun.


Gun shows very little wear, just a few minor marks here and there, and doesn't appear to have been fired very often.  I have never fired it.  The folding  stock has never been installed.


As you know only 180 or so of  these ""evil looking"" shotguns were imported in the 1980s before being banned.  Enough said !


Please be sure this gun is legal to own where you live.  If you buy it and I ship it to your receiving FFL dealer and it is not legal for you to own, your receiving FFL dealer just got a free gun.


I think I've covered it all but feel free to ask questions................"

For sale: This is a CZ 75 SP-01 Shadow custom built and tuned by Angus Hobdell from the CZ Custom shop in AZ. I had this built up for dual purpose carry and competition shooting in USPSA. It's similar in weight to a railed 1911 and is a real pussycat shooting 9mm. 

This is a DA/SA with a safety instead of a decocker, so you can carry it cocked and locked SAO, or manually decock it and carry it DA/SA. 

It features:

- Fit frame and slide
- Trigger and Action job
- Competition Hammer
- Trijicon Night Sights w/ serrated rear
- Ambi Safety
- Extended Mag Release
- Full Length Steel Guide Rod
- Extended Firing Pin for increased reliability
- CZ 85 Combat Original Trigger to eliminate trigger pinch (Has overtravel adjustment screw, currently loc-tighted) 

The single action pull is 3 lb. 4 oz.
Double action is 8 lb. 7 oz. and incredibly smooth.

I've got 4 mags to send with it. 2 16 rounders for concealed carry and 2 19 rounders for competition, duty, or your favorite apocalypse scenario. The 16 rounders fit flush to the frame, while the 19 rounders add about half an inch.

Also to go with it is a comp-tac CTAC IWB holster for comfortable concealed carry.

Comes with the original box and all paperwork, including a factory shot target and warranty.

Like new with only 150 rounds of Federal Champion through it (I would not consider it broken in) and is more accurate than my M&P could ever hope to be.

I've got just over $1400 in it excluding the cost of the holster. I would like $1150 for the whole works."

Available in a carbon steel or stainless steel frame and with the option of a Titanium cylinder, the new Public Defender also features a reduced profile hammer that won't catch when it needs to come out quickly.
Extended Ejector Rod
For positive extraction of fired cases.
rubber Grip
Exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.
Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

Light gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer the shooter the highly visible dot created by the end of the fiber optic

Hello All,
I have for sale a really nice .22 target pistol that is considered by some to be the most accurate .22 rim-fire pistol ever produced.  This one shoots very nice, and has the following features:
Adjustable Trigger
Adjustable Target Sights
Thick Checkered Walnut Target Grips
Vent Rib with accommodation for optics
Barrel Weight for perfect Balance
Textured Front and Back Strap
Two magazines (both factory I believe)
Original Box and all Paperwork
2 boxes of subsonic Remington LR ammo

These guns were used as target pistols by the military because they are designed with the same weight, feel, and grip angle as a standard 1911 (with a little less recoil!).  I would consider this pistol to be in 90-95%, with the only flaw being a blemish in the bluing on the left side of the barrel.  The blemished is only bluing deep. 

The pistol shoots great, and is VERY accurate.

I might be interested in trades for old S&W or Colt Revolvers.

Also, I might be going down I-5 to Federal Way tomorrow (Tuesday 8/28) and can bring this with me if someone is interested."

It’s in excellent condition.  According to the serial number of 18XXX, I’m told it was made in 1958 or ‘59.  On one side of the barrel it says “Made in Belgium”, and on the other side it states “Special Steel – 12 Gauge – 3” Magnum”.   The shotgun retains all most all of it’s original bluing and has very nice checkered furniture.  The stock and blued steel have very minimal wear, not cracks or large scratches, and overall looks wonderful.  It looks more like a couple year old gun that’s sat in the safe most of its life, not the 54 year old firearm that it is!  It also has the desirable magazine cutoff, so you can keep the magazine loaded, and load one shell at a time.  I don’t see a marking for the choke... my assumption it that it’s full choke because it shoots a nice tight group.  It is equipped with a long 31” barrel.  The action reduces felt recoil tremendously, so that it’s really a pleasure to shoot.  Sorry about the pics; because the bluing is so good, it seems to suck up the light.  In a couple of pictures it looks like a gun that retains less bluing, but rest assured that it is just my lack of skill with the camera, not the gun.  Please shoot me an e-mail (no pun intended!) if you want to come take a look.   Thanks for looking!

You don't want to be embarrassed with a sub-par rifle on any hunt. And perhaps this is the year you need to upgrade your hunting rifle. The X-Bolt Medallion bolt action rifle is presented with a fine gloss-finished, checkered walnut stock. The steel receiver is engraved and has a blued finish for beauty and durability. Insuring long-range accuracy is the totally free-floated barrel and Feather Trigger System, two of the most critical components of any high-powered hunting rifle. Action of the bolt is sure, smooth and secure. Rounds fed from the detachable box magazine align the bullet straight with the chamber providing reliable smooth feeding. This way, cartridges push directly in-line with the bore, sure, simple and secure. Many other high-powered, bolt-action rifles may catch your eye. But feature-to-feature, the X-Bolt Medallion has more critical features to help you shoot straight and bag that deer every time, confidently, accurately.

You get so much gun for your money with this company, and a top of the line warranty. I Built this for competition shooting. Tasco 6x24 mill dot scope, Warne competition scope rings, and Kodiak Limbsaver strap. This gun is new and has had less than 25 rounds shot through it (built it, then got into a car accident). Most accurate .22 LR you will find for silhouette shooting or hunting. Free float, bull barrel which means no rattle when firing unlike it's more expensive counterparts (ahem ruger 10-22). I have modified the trigger to make it a 2lbs pull. This gun is a steal from the casual hunter to the competition shooter. Thumb safety and .22 caliber make it a GREAT first rifle for the young'ins too. It is super clean and so new it comes with a Savage Arms warranty. I have no use for it this season as I just got major left hand/arm surgery that will keep me out of the game for a good amount of time. Costed me well over $450.00 to assemble, not to mention taxes and fees. Which we all know are a killer on any firearm or accessories. With ammo as expensive as it is, now is the time to get a .22 that's accurate, fun, and cheap to shoot. The money you save from shooting this caliber alone will save you.

The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun.  The MKA 1919                                                      not only resembles the M16 rifle
but the control and function are similar.  The MKA 1919 is unlike any other
12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine
fed.  The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated
action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel.
 The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is
concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard.  The MKA 1919 barrel can be
very easily removed from the upper receiver.   The upper receiver is
manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip,
and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer.  The
MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal
chokes.  The magazine release button mimics the M16 rifle location.  The
manual safety also duplicates the M16 style being located on the left side
of the receiver above the pistol grip.  The top of the receiver has a
carrying handle and  integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or
any optical accessories.  The MKA 1919 12 gauge shotgun is appropriate for
all levels of hunting and sporting enthusiasts.

For more than five decades the 870 has set the standard for pump-action performance. Receivers are milled from a solid billet of steel for strength and durability. Twin action bars ensure smooth, reliable nonbinding action.   Weatherproof black synthetic stocks and forends. 18"" fixed-cylinder-choke barrel with a single-bead front sight. Magazine holds six 2-3/4"" or 3"" shells and one in the chamber for seven-shot capacity.

This Shotgun is lightly used, and what I mean by that it's been cleaned before and after a shoot and i've only shot maybe 200-250 shells. Then back in the gun safe she went. Considering it's an 870 that's just warming her up. This deal comes with many extras worth in excess of $300!

The Package
(1) Remington 870 Express 
(1) Tactical Shotgun Scabbard multi camo with retention strap, shoulder sling and/or straps for molle gear.    
(1) Choate Mark 5 Synthetic Stock with pistol grip- ""the one on the firearm in the picture"". It has adjustable length of pull to better fit you preference.
(1) Original Remington Synthetic Stock
(1) Mako 3-picatinny Rail Forend 
(1) Original Remington Synthetic forend 
(1) 6-Shot Ace Soft Side Saddle for butt stock 
(1) Knights Armament Vertical Grip
(1) Remington 2-Shell Magazine Extension 
(25) Shells 10 Hornady Critical Defense 00Buck Shells / 15 Estate #8 Shot Shells 
(1) Remington Trigger Lock & Key

So what we have here is the perfect home defense shotgun / zombie slaying machine. Or maybe you have a hunters delight, just swap the barrel for something longer and watch the feathers fly. Either way this shotgun has barley been used and well taken care of.  It's ready to put some rounds down range.  Avoid paying all the taxes,FFL fees, and shipping cost, save yourself a few more bucks and buy some more ammo. 
I almost forgot, last but not least it has sling mounts on both butt stocks and one swivel mount on the front as well as another sling mounting point on the Mako forend if desired.

Happy hunting, what ever that may be!  

If you would like more pictures just let me know. I couldn't post them because the were too big."

The Model 700 Varmint-Tactical Rifle (VTR) is a revolutionary system
optimized for extended range precision and mobility. Its triangular barrel
contour is a product of years of rigorous research and development focused
on reducing weight, enhancing rigidity and promoting rapid heat
dissipation. To decrease recoil and muzzle jump, this uniquely contoured
22"" barrel has an integral muzzle brake that's machined in during
production. Along with the barrel design, Remington brought together a host of other
cutting edge features on this super accurate Model 700 platform. The
results are nothing short of astounding. Chambered for the inherently tight
grouping 223 and 308 calibers, each model engineered with a rate of twist
optimized for tactical style bullets, the Model 700 VTR is compact and
swift handling thanks to its sleek lines and short action. The legendary
three-rings-of-steel and the many other superior design elements of this
rifle deliver the highest degree of out-of-the-box accuracy available
today. Plus, it's matched with the X-Mark Pro Trigger system for the
ultimate in crispness and shot control. For improved consistency, the green
synthetic stock has a vented beavertail forend that promotes rapid cooling.
Its overmold accents provide a firm gripping surface, and the dual sling
swivel studs permit convenient attachment of a bipod and a sling.

They are really built strong, and they have easily held up well with full power ammo compared to others that have had problems. It comes complete with 2 original factory magazines, original box, original cleaning kit, and all paperwork. I bought it new many years ago, and only shot one box of ammo through it.

I bought this gun for deer hunting in southern wisconsin but bought a shotgun a few years ago and dont have much need for this laying around. It is a fun gun for target practice as you can shoot 38 specials through it which keeps ammo costs down. I am including 100 rounds of ammo. Two boxes of 50.

Its a great gun and I do not mind having it around but with my other guns I just dont have much use for it anymore.

The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize in standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, v5-300 AAC Blackout Complete Upper Receiver Group comes in two different configurations no sights or fixed front/rear sights.

The 300 BlackOut is designed to be shot suppressed and un-surpressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions.  The testing of the Daniel Defense 300 BlackOut firearms indicates that un-surpressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend.  Although, though our extensive testing we did ascertain that the utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-surpressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.

The Daniel Defense v7 Upper Receiver Group is built off the extremely popular v5 platform. We incorporated the new Modular Float Rail 12.0 to provide each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability. Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube. In addition, the installation of Modular Picatinny Rail sections is accomplished with little effort. This allows the shooter to customize the rail set up.

The v7 URG is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

The Daniel Defense v7 URG comes in 2 different configurations no sights or fixed front/rear sights.  THIS ONE HAS NO SIGHTS.

The Daniel Defense, v7-6.8SPC Upper Receiver Group is set up as a Special Purpose complete upper with the Daniel Defense 18” Cold Hammer Forged barrel, along with the new Modular Float Rail 12.0 to provide each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability. Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube. In addition, the installation of Modular Picatinny Rails is accomplished with little effort. This allows the shooter to customize the rail set up. The 18” barrel allows the shooter to accurately reach out a little further than the standard 16” version.

it is a yugo milled sks with grenade launcher sight and bayonet lug with a tactical dragunov buttstock on it. it is  not stamped like some of the cheaper sks' ak's 
this one is made from a solid blocks of steel that are milled out to shape and size used to build it and not from a flat sheet of steel heat treated and bent into shape this thing is heavy duty and is a non used military surplus gun.


it has 2 30 round detachable clips. is highly similar to the one in the photo.

1 is a tapco and one is steel surplus.

looking to trade for a saiga unconverted rifle/shotgun. prefer those in 7.62x39

this gun has no problems and has been tooken care of and cleaned after every gun range visit. have only shot 500 rounds through it. has strong rifleing and bore and is a accurate gun. hit paper out to about 200 yards with iron sights i have no doubt it would have shot further but that was the furtherst that the gun range had.

 it has the bayonet lug but there is no bayonet. there are 75 round drums for this gun and also many different stock sets similar to the ak. the sks is the cheaper alternative and is almost the same.

 has adjustable sight aperture for elevation distance and has a bolt hold open feature within the magazine. im not for sure but i also belive that this rifle has a last round bolt hold open feature as well. 


if i get the time or chance to do it for my friend i was going to do some light fileing to the bolt carrier and this would allow it to accept magazines with the bolt face closed like the ak 

there is a scope mount that utg tactical makes that holds zero that is under 35-40$ or cheaper i belive. there is also numerous alternatives all over ebay.

there is also a special bipod made specifically for this gun for under 25$ on gunbroker last time i looked that clamps down on the bayonet lug.

you could in theory go and get the scope mount , a decent scope and the bipod and have a sks/dragunov looking type gun. but my friend wants a saiga rifle like i do because i have converted them and have the tools and told him i would help him to do it.

he also will sell it for 450 or best offer now low ball offers not worth time you can look up the value of this gun, with the aftermarket stock and the simple possible modification i mentiond thats all over youtube it is well worth the price.

just respond to the add and reach me via email, if we reach a good sale/trade agreement we can then contact eachother via phone ect....and discuss it. thanks for looking"
