I am always shopping around for ammo. I always seem to go everywhere and always find what I don't need. I have recently noticed all the ammo price gouging going on here. So because of that reason I have decided to begin posting the location of any bulk ammo that I find in retail stores. As of now I am located in the mint Hill area and have been shopping at local retail locations. The Walmart on Albemarle Road seems to have handgun ammunition but they are always out of Winchester and Remington 9 mm and 380. They always seem to have the most handgun ammunition available. Through talking to sales associates at Walmart I have come to find out that they get trucks every other night. Freight comes out on the floor at 9 o'clock but you should check with gun sales department to see what time associates leave at night. Sometimes you only have an hour window to get ammunition because no one is left in the department with keys. Also Dick's sporting goods in Matthews has been getting trucks on Friday morning. According to Lodge associate they have been getting more ammunition than normal. But they have been setting a limit on ammunition purchases. He also said that they have been getting in .223. Don't bother going to the Walmart in Indian Trail. As of yesterday they only had a few boxes of miscellaneous ammunition nothing for handguns. Also Walmart in locust has been out all handgun ammunition. I have occasionally seen 22 WinMag there. Information pertaining to when freight comes out on the floor at Walmart was acquired at Locust Walmart not sure if that pertains to the other store locations. Also Dick's sporting goods used to offer 10% off with case purchase you may be able to sneak that deal in with some sales associates. Look for cases of shotgun ammo with an orange sticker. I will continue to post any information about ammunition as I come across that. I hope this helps others out and saves them money. Good luck.

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine is slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length and fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.  Sealed in plastic $150 each."

The Huldra 5.56 mid-length upper is a standard mil-spec upper that will work on any mil-spec AR lower. The mid-length piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. Huldra's Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome. 

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber."

Chainsaw:

NOVESKE CHAINSAW grade rifles and components are perfect for the guy (or bad ass chick) who plans on using his rifle as a tool. We strive for perfection in every way, including setting the industry standard for cosmetic perfection. Inevitably, there are parts that do not make it past our incredibly stringent quality control for minor cosmetic blemishes. These culled parts will still deliver the same performance you can expect from a NOVESKE product. Rather than stare at boxes of parts perfectly capable of pumping more lead into Mother Earth, we have marked them with a little chainsaw, are offering these at a discounted rated. Leave your microscope at school and your camera on landscape setting; Chainsaws are not for stamp collectors."

The gun comes with two 15 round magazines and a set of factory sig night sights (non-adjustable). 

Heres a link to look at factory specs: http://sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/p229-elite-dark.aspx 

As for condition of the pistol it is in Nice Used shape. The pistol has been used only at the range and has seen about 600 rounds of quality ammo. I did holster the pistol when in use so there is some holster wear on the slide and a little on the frame. It is harder to notice when the pistol is oiled but is slightly visible. Overall I have never had any issues with the pistol; cycled and fired every time with absolutely no issues. I cleaned the pistol after EVERY use! If I had to rate its overall condition I would say its a 8 out of 10. 

Please look at all the pictures and provided link. The gun is being sold in AS IS condition and like mentioned, it is USED. Will do FTF cash or if shipping USPS Money Order and FFL information must be provided for shipment! Shipping for this item will be $25 and will be shipped through a FFL dealer. Any questions, please ask! Item also listed on Gunbroker."

The same used by the U.S. Military, and it is NOT a cheap knock-off!  100% Authentic.  GUARANTEED! If you're looking at this auction I'm probably not going to tell you anything that you don't already know about how great this weapon optic is, how much they cost, or how much just a mount itself costs.  Night vision compatable, 4 MOA dot. 
Comes with everything shown; sight, M68 mount, killflash, rubber lens caps, extra battery, and military manual.   Genuine & Authentic U.S. Military Issue Riser SET for Aimpoint M68 CCO / CompM2.  Steel insert raises height of a mounted M68 approx. 1/4"" in order to place red dot above fixed front sights. 
  SET also Includes steel riser insert, 4 extended-length screws and allen wrench.

I am also selling a Knock-off Aimpoint 3X Magnifier with a Knock-off La-rue Flip to side mount.  This  lines a perfectly with the the Red-Dot on your AR. See My Pix.  I paid $600 for an Aimpoint 3X Magnifier from Amazon and honestly there is hardly any difference between the real vs the clone..  I mean a magnifier is a magnifier after all.  What really matters is the Red-Dot and it doesn't get any better then Aimpoint.

I will sell everything together for $475! :)  This is a great deal.  All optics and mounts you see pictured is what you get.    The LaRue picture I posted is the real deal but I wanted to show that is how the clone Larue mount and 3x Magnifier will function.

Also also also you get a stock wrench AND a nice hard plastic Daniel Defense case WITH a padlock and key. So basically I'm selling you your dream gun with all the extras. I am sad to see this go as I bought it in California (hence the bullet button and 10/30 mag) and have only put 150 rounds through it. It's in excellent condition and I'm looking to sell it soon as I have bills to pay. I'm in Portland but would be willing to drive a little bit if you are serious about buying it. I have more pictures and would be happy to answer any questions. I also have the original DROS paperwork with my name on it if you're paranoid. If you reinstall the bullet button and use the 10/30 mag it is legal in California (at least as of last November) as well. Asking $1800 OBO, seems fair for what I paid, what you get, and what the non-gouge price is currently. And yes I know, my garage is a bit of a mess.
