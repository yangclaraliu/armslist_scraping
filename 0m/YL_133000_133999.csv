I've only put about two magazines or so through it, and kept it well cleaned and oiled any time I took it out to the range. I purchased it from a gun show about a year ago and just haven't used it much and realized I like rifles and other long-guns more.

I also have available for it two magazines, a small carrying case, and about 1,000 rounds of 7.62x25 ammo (surplus ammo, but all good and clean).

The serial numbers match all over the gun, it is originally a 1954 model (indicated by the year stamped on top of the slide) and was brought to the US by Intrac in Knoxville, TN. I believe it is a Polish Tokarev, as the laser engraving from Intrac indicates ""POLAND"" next to the caliber.

I will let the ammo go with it if I get my asking price of $350.00 - I will consider other offers, I will also consider trading for a ""Dragunov"" rifle (plus cash on my part, if need-be), the AK-47 styled long gun, also called a PSL I believe?

This is the new SSAR15 Sliding Bump Stock.  It is the most incredible accessory to ever come out for the AR-15.  It is a fully controlable bump fire stock that replaces your current 6 position stock and allows you to litterally fire your AR-15 5.56/223 or 9mm at near full auto and short burst that are controlable.  It is 50% more controlable than a true full auto becuase of the sliding stock that absorbs recoil.  

I currently have one on my Rock River and it is awesome.  They sell on line if you can get them for $350 to $400.  They are selling these things as fast as they can make them.  

Popular belief is that this will be a very short lived product even though the BATF has already approved the device as an accessory. When the national left wing media see this thing operate it will be hard to keep it from being regulated in some way.  

I bought 3 of them and have 2 of them on my rock river and stag.  I am willing to sell one for $400 or take a trade if you dont have the cash."

Very compact & light weight.  Overall length is 36 3/4"" & weight is a little less than 6 pounds.  18"" free floated barrel.  This rifle has seen little field use.  The bore, chamber & crown are in perfect condition.  The original wood stock is 99% with only a couple tiny marks.  The metal is completely rust, gouge, mar, & mark free.  Very accurate, but not a ""kids"" or beginner's rifle.  Because of it's light weight & short barrel, it has above average recoil.  Not horrid, but you feel it.   The scope is an earlier Leupold with a tapered cross hair Vari-X II 2-7x33 in excellent condition.  Crystal clear & mounted with Leupold QRW rings on a Weaver rail.  This makes it easily removable & returns it to zero every time.  I am asking $825 for it & I don't need to sell it, but where I am going to be hunting for the next several years, a $300 30-30 would be just as good.

The gun is like new in the box, and includes everything that came with it originally.
I am the first and only owner, and never registered the gun, so you can register it with Phoenix and get the lifetime warranty.

The Deluxe Rangemaster kit includes:
- HP22A pistol with 3"" vent rib barrel and 10-shot mag
- 5"" extended vent rib target barrel
- Extra 10-shot mag with finger extension (more comfortable for folks with larger hands)
- Steel mag well gun lock
- Cleaning rod, bushes, patches (never used, I have my own cleaning kit)
- Tiny bottle of Break Free CLP cleaner/lube
- Manual, warranty card, misc paperwork, and iron-on ""Phoenix Arms"" patch
- All housed in a hard plastic, lockable kit that holds everything snugly for storage or transport.
Here's the Phoenix Amrs site with the full description of the kit and better photos: http://www.phoenix-arms.com/Products/HP22A_Deluxe.html

Please note that this is the DELUXE Rangemaster kit, not the regular Rangemaster. The difference is this deluxe includes both barrels and a second magazine.

Also included is a truly unique set of hand made not-quite-finished Black Walnut grips.
I made these in my shop, but never got around to final sanding and applying a finish. They're a little thicker than the stock plastic grips and feel a lot nicer in the hand for folks like me with larger hands.
They are functional as-is, but would probably take less than an hour to make them truly beautiful.

When I say this gun is like new, I mean you won't be able to tell it didn't just come out of the box unless you take it apart and see the little internal wear marks from firing.
I have put less than 1 50-round box of ammo through it in the year or so I've owned it.

This is a legally registered firearm, so you'll need to either come to my local gun dealer's shop to do the paperwork (permit required) or have it shipped to the FFL dealer of your choice, who will process the transfer for you.
I am willing to ship, but once you transfer it, it's yours. For this reason, I encourage local sales.

I am willing to do a full or partial trade for Ruger 10/22 parts/upgrades.
This is really why I'm getting rid of it. I'm moving to a rifle and don't need both."

This is an original A1, so if you are a new genner looking for a tactical rifle this is not it, if you are looking for a collecter piece or a battle proven can fire 12,000 rds easily and is light weight ,than this is it.
The barrel is marked C MP Chrome Lined, it is colt. The upper is marked C M, which is colt. The front sight is marked C, for colt. The rear buttstock, triangle handguards, and pistol grip are original colt.
There is only one part not original, BUT it is still marked C for colt and that is the Bolt Carrier, it is Colt but from a later model because it has forward assist serrations, should be smooth......everything however is Colt. Bore is chrome lined and smooth!

The Walther® P22 is a user-friendly adaptation of the larger P99. The same look. The same feel. Only three quarters of the size of its big brother. But this little guy loads rimfire .22 LR rounds in double action for the first round, and single action for remaining rounds until the magazine is empty. Unleashing the first round is easy with only about 12 pounds of pressure required to activate the double action and emptying the magazine is even easier with single action requiring just under 5 pounds of pressure.   

Of course, firing the Walther® P22 to begin with is impossible without a magazine locked firmly in place. This is because of the P22’s magazine disconnect safety feature. Without a magazine firmly in, the trigger bar passes beneath the P22’s lockwork due to pressure from the disconnect spring. The force of the disconnect spring also functions in the rapid ejection of a cleared magazine when released. Magazine ejection is triggered by an ambidextrous lever located behind and below the trigger of the Walther® P22.

For comfort and customization, the P22 has an additional backstrap to adjust grip
2 Barrels are included, 3.4” & 5”, 5"" barrel also has a compensator (shown installed with 5” barrel). Barrels can be interchanged within minutes at the operators will. Both barrels are threaded with thread protectors for both.

The original buttplate is intact (no aftermarket recoil pad). It has a 27"" barrel and is a modified choke, (**) on the barrel signifies the modified choke. At least I'm pretty sure it does. The receiver has A10 268 stamped on it. I think this would indicate the date of manufacture as 1968 with the alloy receiver. There is some wear on the barrel bluing near the receiver (no rust) and some hunting wear on the stock. Overall I would rate this shotgun 80%-85%. The grain in the stock is very nice. Price is $425.00. I have additional photo's if anyone is interested. Feel free to contact me with any questions. REDACTED"

This pistol featured a beautiful polished slide and jeweled barrel.  The TALO models are limited editions and really stand out from other Glocks.  If you are looking for a great looking and great shooting gun, you've found it!

  I purchased this gun in 2008 and have only shot it a few times.  I've probably 50-100 rounds through it.  The gun is lovingly maintained and looks factory new.  It has been stored in a climate controled safe and been regularly inspected and maintained.

  Originally intended for this one to be a CC gun, but it's just too pretty to get scratched and abused, so I'm trying to sell it to fund a new Glock 23 RTF.

  Gun will be delivered with all factory documentation and accessories (including 2 factory mags, brush, mag loading tool, and lock).

  I will only accept cash or money orders for payment.  Price is negotiable to some extent, but within reason.  It's a used gun, but just barely.

  I require a signed bill of sale (I keep the original and you get a copy) and photo ID.  I'll meet with the buyer at a safe, mutually agreeable location for us both to complete the transaction."

Right off the bat, I'll tell you that you can go on to Wicked Laser's website right now and order this very laser for $299.99. However, I won't take anything close to that. The FDA (yes FDA) has put an import ban on any handheld laser above 5mw. This particular laser is 200x more powerful then what current import allows. Actually getting your hands on one of these is VERY diffcult. I'm a GM for UPS and even with my connections in customs, it still took me 6 1/2 months to get a hold of mine.

However, once you DO have one, they are pretty incredible. It will burn or melt most things dark colored. You can cut through plastics, light cigs, pop ballons, start fires, etc. The beam is so powerful that if you pointed it straight up in the air, no only can you see the beam the entire way up, but the only reason it doesn't hit outter space is because our inner atmosphere diffuses the beam. If you were at sea, and pointed the beam straight out infront of you, the only reason you aren't able to see it past a certain point is because of the curvature of the Earth.

Two disclaimers, 1) If you arent familiar with Romanians, this is in average condition for them. Meaning yes there are light surface scratches on the gun here and there. They basically arent deep enough to show up on pics, but if you want close pics I have some on the cell phone. 2) The front site peg as is does not stick up as high above the tapco stock as I'd want, and could used raised. NOT AN ISSUE WITH WOOD STOCK

Very compact & light weight.  Overall length is 36 3/4"" & weight is a little less than 6 pounds.  18"" free floated barrel.  This rifle has seen little field use.  The bore, chamber & crown are in perfect condition.  The original wood stock is 99% with only a couple tiny marks.  The metal is completely rust, gouge, mar, & mark free.  Very accurate, but not a ""kids"" or beginner's rifle.  Because of it's light weight & short barrel, it has above average recoil.  Not horrid, but you feel it.   The scope is an earlier Leupold with a tapered cross hair Vari-X II 2-7x33 in excellent condition.  Crystal clear & mounted with Leupold QRW rings on a Weaver rail.  This makes it easily removable & returns it to zero every time.  I am asking $775 for it, or $575 without the scope & rings.  Where I am going to be hunting for the next several years, a $300 30-30 would be just as good. 

That being said, I am open to trades, especially a Marlin 336 plus cash.  I would also take a Glock 17 plus cash, Ruger mini-30 or a SKS SPORTER that uses AK mags plus cash.  Feel free to make an offer if you don't like my price, or offer something interesting as a trade.   I have no desire to trade for old military relics, AR-15s, AK-47s, shotguns, .22s etc.  Your trade must be in the same condition as my rifle.  I will not add money to any trade & I will expect detailed pictures of any trade.  Call or text REDACTED.  This is a very beautiful rifle, I just don't need it."

My main goal is to get a 357 in the Ruger or Smith Wesson line only .  #1 Choice  I will trade for a Ruger GP100 with a 3 inch barrel (full lug) only.  A Ruger SP101 Or a S&W Model 60 with a 3 inch barrel, or S&W 686 with a 3-4 inch barrel would be good as well.

I am ok with another CZ pistol as well such as  a CZ 75 compact 9MM or CZ duty 07 in 40 SW since I want a little bigger pistol and like CZ pistols.  Will trade ammo for ammo as well if neccessary if the other party needs some ammo.  I also have interest in a Glock 20 or Glock 29 if one is out there.

Pistol has 2 extended mags black polycoat finish in 96% plus condition. This is a a great conceal carry pistol.  Luma Glow night sights. 

 If trading I expect your item to be in like condition, 1 nice pistol for the others nice pistol.  Thanks for looking

The Night Shadow comes standard with our cutting edge ""Smart"" technology. This technology consists of a computerized proximity sensor, digital controls and a long-range infra-red illuminator. The proximity sensor will automatically turn the unit on and off when it is brought to the viewing position. This helps save your battery life and the life of the unit itself. The digital controls allow you to activate all of the features of the Night Shadow with an easy push of a button. We also built a powerful infra-red illuminator into the scope. This allows you to see even in total darkness with outstanding clarity. It is dark. You can barely see your hand in front of your face. You bring your Night Shadow night vision device up to your eyes and turn it on. Suddenly, in green-hued clarity, the entire scene is like day. For camping, boating, nature study, or Law Enforcement, there is simply no better binocular night vision device on the market

I have very rarely used this unit. It has a carrying case, cleaning cloth, manual, and new batteries used only to make sure this still works.

Burns/Cuts/Melts,"South OK, Oklahoma, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Sunday, May 8, 2011",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This is a brand new Wicked Lasers Spyder III Arctic 1 watt blue laser. Right off the bat, I'll tell you that you can go on to Wicked Laser's website right now and order this very laser for $299.99. However, I won't take anything close to that. The FDA (yes FDA) has put an import ban on any handheld laser above 5mw. This particular laser is 200x more powerful then what current import allows. Actually getting your hands on one of these is VERY diffcult. I'm a GM for UPS and even with my connections in customs, it still took me 6 1/2 months to get a hold of mine. From what I'm told 85% of these are seized.

However, once you DO have one, they are pretty incredible. It will burn or melt most things dark colored. You can cut through plastics, light cigs, pop ballons, start fires, etc. The beam is so powerful that if you pointed it straight up in the air, no only can you see the beam the entire way up, but the only reason it doesn't hit outter space is because our inner atmosphere diffuses the beam. If you were at sea, and pointed the beam straight out infront of you, the only reason you aren't able to see it past a certain point is because of the curvature of the Earth.



I understand this isn't what you typically see, so if you have any questions feel free to ask.

789,http://www.armslist.com/posts/133789,For Trade:  Wicked Lasers Spyder Arctic III 1 Watt blue laser. Burns/Cuts/Melts,"South OK, Dallas, Texas",Offer,"Listed On: Sunday, May 8, 2011",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This is a brand new Wicked Lasers Spyder III Arctic 1 watt blue laser. Right off the bat, I'll tell you that you can go on to Wicked Laser's website right now and order this very laser for $299.99. However, I won't take anything close to that. The FDA (yes FDA) has put an import ban on any handheld laser above 5mw. This particular laser is 200x more powerful then what current import allows. Actually getting your hands on one of these is VERY diffcult. I'm a GM for UPS and even with my connections in customs, it still took me 6 1/2 months to get a hold of mine. From what I'm told 85% of these are seized.

However, once you DO have one, they are pretty incredible. It will burn or melt most things dark colored. You can cut through plastics, light cigs, pop ballons, start fires, etc. The beam is so powerful that if you pointed it straight up in the air, no only can you see the beam the entire way up, but the only reason it doesn't hit outter space is because our inner atmosphere diffuses the beam. If you were at sea, and pointed the beam straight out infront of you, the only reason you aren't able to see it past a certain point is because of the curvature of the Earth.



I understand this isn't what you typically see, so if you have any questions feel free to ask."

I am the original owner of this pistol, it has only had maybe 100-200 rounds through it in its lifetime. It was very accurate the last time I shot it, plinking off 12ga shells from 7-10 yards. There is a hairline .5 inch crack in the plastic grips on the left side (not pictured).

$100 obo


Upon sale, I will require a simple visual inspection of your drivers license to make sure that you are a WA resident, it is current (not expired) and you are 18+ years of age. I will also have a simple bill of sale (name & date) for a record of the purchase."
