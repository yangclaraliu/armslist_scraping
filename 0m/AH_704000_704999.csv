The APECS is constructed with a proprietary GORE-TEX® fabric that's 40 percent quieter than previous ECWCS fabrics - to help you operate more effectively in the field. It's engineered to remain durably waterproof even after exposure to contaminants, such as jet fuel, gasoline, hydraulic fluid, DEET, and other petroleums, oils, and lubricants. And that means your gear will last longer.

This was a police issued revolver that is finished in the rare Matte finish. This finish was special ordered for a very few select Law Enforcement Agencies. The finish is at 85-90%. The grips need restoring but the wood and badge's is great shape. There is 0 play anywhere on this gun. It is tight and the riffling is fantastic shape. There is a good bit of information floating around the net about these guns. It was acquired many years ago from my family in Texas around the DFW area. This is a very nice collector piece if your in to wheel guns. Thanks!

This is pretty much everything you need to get out on the field and play. Automags are purely mechanical magazines and won't fail because of a bad battery; they're incredibly tough and many are still in service after the better part of two decades worth of use. This is a lifetime marker and I am only parting with it because I just don't have time to play anymore.

To use these flats you will need to have a 5mm and 7mm reamer.  The physics of bending sheet metal make it next to impossible to have a bend close to a hole without distorting slightly.  To solve this the holes on the flat are undersized and need to be reamed to size. 
The rails that come with the flats are pictured below. They have mag stabilizers on both rails to keep the mag from tilting and causing feed problems.  Before installing the rails you will need to trim the mag stabilizers to match the thickness of the Mag you are using. (7.62 or 5.56)"

It is a Norinco NHM-91. If you know these models you know that the norinco ak's are some of the best. This one has a 20 inch barrell, all tapco furniture, tapco trigger, UTG bipod, good padded carry case, removeable scope mount, and a decent scope. Comes with one 5 round mag and one 20 round mag. This rifle shoots great and never malfunctions. I have shot all kinds of different ammo and she eats it all. Most ak's are really only good to about 75-100 yards out. With the long barrell, scope and decent ammo I have had good groups at 200, and thats pretty good with a AK. Anyway looking for $750 obo cash or would trade for comparable AR-15, no junk and I know my rifles. I do not have to sell this rifle so stupid $300 offers will be joyfully ignored. Any trade could include a few more 30 round mags depending on what comes with the AR, also could trade some ammo. I would prefer a 5.56 barrelled ar but would consider a .223. I know some think its the same but in my travels I have found that to be untrue, anyway email, text or call 515-418-6zero6zero"

VLTOR Mil-Spec Receiver Extension:
Receiver extension tube has the correct, 1.146"" outside diameter for mounting collapsible buttstocks designed for the smaller, mil-spec tube. Allows fast, easy repeatability of buttstock position with five notches on underside to accept the stock’s locking pin and corresponding white position numbers on top visible through the witness hole on many stocks. Precision machined from aluminum bar stock for consistent dimensions that ensure smooth, snag-free sliding of buttstock.

Redesigned hammer pin and anti-rotation links provide the strongest possible system to eliminate pin rotation. Helps prevent wear to receiver holes, which is especially important for increasingly-valuable M16 and pre-ban receivers. Notched hammer pin locks into slots in the anti-rotation links; trigger is secured with locking screws, and includes lube ports so adequate lubrication reaches the trigger. Anti-rotation links fit on the outside of the receiver to prevent all movement.

Battle Comp 2.0:
Multi-purpose compensator reduces muzzle climb, so you stay on target between shots during rapid fire engagements. Reduces flash signature and produces less concussion than the standard A2 flash hider for a smaller dust signature when shooting prone.

*****************************************************
Romanian PSL-54C / FPK Dragunov - TG Knox receiver 'Made In Romania'. The scope and all accessories are included with this set: Complete bayonet / scabbard / frog, leather sling, complete cleaning kit w/3-piece cleaning rod, a 4 mag capacity field pouch, three 10 round capacity magazines (1 is unnumbered - 2 non-matching), a Romanian TIP2 6x24 (dated 1975) side rail mounted scope, canvas scope cover, scope cleaning cloth and a yellow scope lens filter. The tritium illumination on the scope has expired. Also includes a new adjustable bipod (8-12""), a TGI FPK / Dragunov manual and a manual for zeroing the Russian SVD style reticle scope. The cleaning kit has: 7.62x54R broken cartridge extractor, gas port reamer, cleaning jag, brush, pin tool, grease bottle, tube / cap and a black pouch to keep all of it in, PLUS a spare sight post, bolt extractor retaining pin, bolt extractor spring and a firing pin retainer. Everything is either new, unissued or unused and will be shipped in a hard case (Plano plastic/foam lined).

All serial numbered components on the rifle match, with the exception of the bolt itself, and the 'Made in Romania' TG Knox receiver serial number. Original Romanian hammer forged chrome lined barrel with sharp rifling and it's mirror bright. It has a matching numbered threaded muzzle brake (14x1mm LH thread with a spring pin lock) and an INTACT bayonet lug. The receiver has the original bolt hold open center support piece, but does NOT include the little parts (spring, pin and lifter foot). The Romanian parkerized finish was also completely blued over externally. The outside of the barrel where it was originally pressed into the front trunnion exhibits a minimal gall, but it does not affect fit, finish or function. The barrel trunnion is attached with grade 8 screws. All other receiver attachments are riveted. There are a few very minor small dents in the wood handguards (~ 1/8"" long). The stock furniture is in exceptional condition otherwise, with no cracks or repairs and matches relatively well, with the butt stock about a slight shade darker. I fired 10 rounds to check fit and function, as this rifle was completely new and unfired. I will include the cartridges for inspection, so the ejection can be 'fine tuned' to adjust the direction and distance of the ejected cartridges. All in all, a very NICE PSL / FPK in outstanding condition that shoots / runs perfectly. It has been listed as used, since it was test fired to ensure safe operation, but it is essentially new. Buy it and break it in! PSL's are like AK's. It takes at least a couple hundred rounds to get it loosened up and running free, then you just never worry about it again, since it's a Kalashnikov action built on the same receivers as the Romanian RPK.

Payment to be Cash / USPS Money Order / Cashier's Check, or I can accept credit cards or bank transfer cash through PayPal (Invoiced with DISCREET payment only, with NO mention of GB, firearms or anything else related, since I need my PayPal account for FeeBay and don't want it locked down or closed). For any type of PayPal transaction, the buyer will have to add an additional 4% to cover their transaction 'fee'. I will invoice the buyer directly, which will include all required fees. All applicable firearms FFL transfer and shipping regulations apply, and the buyer is responsible for determining if the firearm is legal to own in their area, plus complying with whatever your various local regulations are. No sales to California residents or any other place where semi-auto rifles are prohibited or magazine restrictions say you can't exercise your 2nd Amendment rights. The entire package will be shipped for free, but note the requirement below for an additional FFL transfer fee on my end if required, which will be extra.

For all of you new gun owners, virgin bidders and out of state interested parties, I am an individual seller, so check with your receiving FFL to see if they'll accept the rifle shipment FROM an individual. BATF regulations allow shipments from any individual to any FFL, but some FFL licensees just won't do it. If yours won't, an additional $25 fee WILL be added for having to transport to and ship through an FFL on my end. After the purchase, you will have to inform me of how it has to be shipped, then have your FFL send me (or the FLL on my end) their signed license form and address information (hardcopy or email). I will invoice you for the total amount due AFTER you get the FFL / shipping figured out, so if you're serious, check with your FFL PRIOR TO BIDDING! I'm shipping it for free in a hard case already, so don't push it and don't drag it out. I'll give the winning bidder THREE DAYS to confirm the shipping method and payment form. That part can usually be handled with a quick phone call to verify if your FFL will or won't receive shipment. For you guys who have an FFL (not just a C&R), you know the drill, and thanks for reading through my rant to the newbies. If you're in Missouri, we can do this face to face and not mess with the shipping restrictions. That would be nice... THANKS for looking!"

This rifle has been cleaned of all cosmoline, and functions perfectly. It shoots the venerable 7.62x39 loaded either one at a time, or with the assistance of 10 round stripper clips (Included). It features an under folding bayonet, a grenade launcher muzzle device, flip up sights for said launcher, flip up night sights, and a cleaning kit in the butt stock. As I said, this rifle looks fresh from the factory, and I've personally put less than 50 rounds through it. Its a very accurate rifle. Also included is a special rubber stop that is inserted into the rear of the rifle (email me if you want pictures) that helps soften the striking of metal when firing.  This is a fine rifle, and these have been going up in price steadily for the past few years. There's also a huge number of aftermarket stocks, scope mounts, and accessories, to suit the shooters preferences. This is a great collectable rifle, ready to hit the range! Brice is OBO, more pictures available upon request. Any questions, feel free to email me, or text me at REDACTED.

I can either put it in storage indefinitely until I get another pistol of that size, or I can give someone a great deal.

This is a Skyball Mountain shoulder rig. As some of you know, they probably make the BEST nylon shoulder rigs out there. Very well designed, adjustable, custom fit, padded shoulders, dual mag pouch, vertical holster, and no velcro like on the imported crap. This is the rig you want if you're carrying a heavy, stainless steel, full-sized automatic pistol with 2 extra mags. I was using this for a S&W 1006, but it will fit any large automatic pistol from a full-sized 1911 to maybe even a smaller Desert Eagle. Other components are available to purchase online if you want to get another size holster or take off the mag pouch and add a RH holster for a NY reload.

This is a size S/M (chest size 34""-40""): ""The construction of this holster is high quality outer wall of black nylon fabric, inner wall of water resistant nylon vapor barrier, soft foam padded liner and inner lined with soft black nylon fabric and black webbing. There are pads on the shoulder area for a comfortable fit as well as straps on each side that attach to your belt to help hold the holster secure. The straps on the shoulder holster are adjustable for a comfortable fit. A double mag pouch is included in the design. This holster sets in the vertical position although we have them mounted in the horizontal position as well.""

I'm asking only $30 CASH for this brand new holster.

I would prefer not to ship this holster. I would like to meet close to the greater Denver area."

This AK has the highly sought after milled receiver. New in the box this rifle has never been fired. It comes with all of the factory accessories and they are still wraped in plastic.

Now is your chance to get a NEW example without the taxes and transfer fees, etc.
I don't need to sell this AK so there is very little wiggle room in the price. I take CASH only, no trades. I will not ship. We must meet FTF and you need to have a valid CO drivers license. No bad guys. Lowballers will be respectfully ignored. Please leave a valid email or phone# if interested.
