I'm selling my CZ vz 58 with all the above mentioned accessories/incidentals. I'm a hobby shooter, I bought this rifle for cheap, it's a fine rifle that shoots around a three group inch at 100 yards (for me, anyway). The PA red dot is quite nice, and I'll be sad to see it go, but I'm throwing it in to sweeten the deal and because I'll have no use for it without the rifle. This is a perfect range toy, home defense weapon, or hog annihilator.

I live in Austin, but I'm open to the option of driving and meet you halfway to wherever you are. Within a certain distance, it's on me, but if you live out in Amarillo or El Paso, I'm going to need to charge a delivery fee for fuel, my time is on me. Just let me know where you are and we can work it out. If you are out of state, contact me and we will figure out shipping.

As previously mentioned, I'm a hobby shooter, so I'm really just selling the vz for seed money for another gun to take down to the range, so if you have something to trade and are interested, let me know! We can value adjust with cash up or down as is appropriate.

THE MOST ADVANCED RIFLE OF ITS KIND!!! 

Overview:

Easily the most advanced rimfire rifle ever built, the Model 597™ represents the first technological breakthrough in the category in 35 years. Our new rifle has all the standard features that have made the originals an American favorite, but with some notable upgrades. Because our Model 597™ action is the ultimate in feeding reliability and out-of-the-box accuracy, it was only natural we develop the Model 597™ TVP™ (Target-Varmint Plinker) to take full advantage of the superior design.

Truly the ultimate 22 target-rifle platform, this tack-driver features a 20"" stainless heavy barrel and a rugged laminated thumbhole stock that’s contoured to accommodate right- and left-handed shooters with equal comfort. The impeccable balance of our new stock design will shine the first time you try an offhand shot. Trust us, one squeeze of the trigger and you’ll be a believer. Its receiver is equipped with a factory-mounted scope rail so you can add optics and be ready to shoot in a flash.
Key Features:

    Bolt-guidance system features twin, tool-steel guide rails
    Offered in laminated wood stock
    Non-glare matte finish
    Patented, 10-shot metal detachable magazine
    Last-shot hold-open bolt for added safety
    Scope rail"

This is a rock solid tack driver of a 1911 with two major additions, Meprolight Night Sights ($100 new), and Crimson Trace Laser Grips ($299 new).  In addition, the pistol is very well tuned with a light trigger, and I’ve had the ambi-safety replaced with a Wilson Combat Safety ($40).  I have the original sights and ambi-safety included along with 2 magazines.  I’m in no rush to sell this gun, but I have two 5” 1911’s and I’d like to fund another project.  This is simply a check to see if anybody is interested, if not, I’m not worried about selling, so no low ball offers and no trades please.  

The PT1911 is easily worth $650 new on its own.  Add in the Meprolight Night Sights, CTC Grips, and Wilson Combat Safety, and this is a great package worth (new) $1024.00.  I’m looking to sell the entire package for $875.00 (OBO) cash.

This AR15 is built with the GPU (gas piston upper), making this rifle far more reliable, cooler, and cleaner than the traditional AR15.  The gas piston upper lets your gun run much cooler.  The piston dramatically reduces FTE's (and in my personal opinion) so low some would consider in on par with AK reliability.  Again, my opinion only, but do some research if you aren't familiar with GPU AR-15's.   The gun has a replacement Hogue grip and the original grip will be included in the sale.  This gun also comes with 2 spare polymer PMAG magazines.  

The gun only has 1 cosmetic flaw on the right side of the barrel by the muzzle break.  The one an only time this gun has been shot, it was during the summer and the person I was shooting with did not lay it on the pad on the back of my truck completely and the end of the firearm touch the hot surface of the bed, and left a cosmetic blemish.  As stated, this gun is not a 100% gun, although it's only fault is cosmetic on the edge of the barrel.  


I have a Trijicon ACOG TA33-8 sight system that I used on this rifle and will be posting a separate listing for it.  However, if you'd like the ACOG included, I will take $100 off the combined total.    I will include pictures of the ACOG as well.

The 2010-2011 Blue Book of Gun Values show the MSRP of the firearm at $1995.00.  The listed value of this gun at 98% is $1575.  I am only going to ask 1000.  The better deal you give someone, the faster you can sell it and honestly this is a fantastic price for this firearm.  I will also be asking 200 less than the listed value of the ACOG.  I will be asking 800 for it, so a 1800 total for each sold individually.  As stated I'll take 100 off for both bought together and will sell them as a unit for 1700.  I will also take an extra 100 off if you show proof of active or retired military service.  

Call me at anytime for any questions or to see the firearm.  I'm off work for the next few days and can meet you at any time if you'd like to see the firearm.

Thanks,

On a side note, if your'e looking for a good pistol, I am putting up 2 ads for a Springfield XDm9 and a XDm40.  Both guns are as close to 100% as you can get without being truly 100% .  Each has only had 1 box of 50 rounds fired through them before the were cleaned and stored.  I can show proof of ownership on every gun I sell.  I will be asking 600 for each and will take more off if you want to combo any of them with another gun I'm selling.   - again thanks for reading!!!

- I have lowered the price from it's original 1300 in order to make a quick sale.  I be surprised if this lasts very long.  First person with 1000 takes it.  Please call me because sometimes my email is slow to arrive."

My Sig comes with factory night sights and three 15 round mags if I can find the third one. Everything on the pistol is factory original. The Sig has seen about 1000 rounds through it, before it became a safe queen.

 I am selling this to fund a new project that I have. I hate seeing it sit in my safe every time I go to the range because it is no longer my carry pistol. The night sights on this Sig are dull except for the slight glow that still appears on the front post. They work well as regular combat sights though, as the last time I shot it I made a 4.5 inch grouping at 10 yards. I by all means am not a marksman per se with my pistols. One of my range partners shot a mag through it at 10 yards and hit a 2 inch grouping with it. 

 I already have an idea for what I see as a reasonable offer for this high quality Sig P226. More explicitly, I would also be willing to trade this for an FNP9 USG in FDE or a full size M&P 9 in FDE or either night sights or threaded barrel. I will entertain all offers but will most likely only except what I asked for in trades. I am trying to make my WROL/SHTF set-up more compatible for my family. I am cutting weight everywhere on my set-up as I would have to pack up a wife and 1.5 year old ASAP... 

 Anywho, if you are interested or have any questions I can be reached at REDACTED from 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM. Ask for Matt. I work third shift so later calls are accepted and I will not see them as rude. All potential buyers need a purchase permit and state ID or a CPL and purchaser's paperwork. Thank you for looking!"

Kimber Pro BP Ten II 1911.

It's a doublestack (high capacity), polymer framed (lightweight), 1911, chambered in .45 ACP.

It comes with two flush fitting 13 round magazines with Wolff extra power magazine springs installed. I have the original magazine springs, as well.

The trigger has been worked by Upstate Armory Group.
The sites that are installed are Truglo fiber optic sights.
It also has an extended slide release installed.

Comes with a Blackhawk Serpa holster that had to be modified to fit this gun, since the frame is a tad wider than a regular 1911.

The gun probably only has a few hundred rounds through it. I've only shot about a hundred rounds through it and I think the previous owner only shot a little bit more than that when he had it.

The reason I want to sell/trade it is to get a full size (5 inch barrel) 1911 or a Sig 229.

This gun is from the 60's and appears to be unfired.  I got it in an estate sale years ago and it has been in my climate controlled safe in storage and I have never fired it.  It has a small ding on the grip which can be seen in the picture where a few of the diamond patterns have been pushed down but it's not a nick.   That is the ONLY flaw on this firearm.  

This thing looks amazing like the day it left the factory. (note the frame is not oblong as the picture looks it is all 100% scaled down in proportion to a Colt 1911) Make a great beginner, collector, or lady's gun."

I have a Saiga 12, made famous by Sons of Guns, and I would like to trade it for something new. I have broken the gun in with 500+ slugs, fixed the gas ports, installed the v-plug (gas plug with 5 settings to let you shoot cheap low brass), polished the bolt to allow mag insertion with a closed bolt. The gun works flawlessly which if you know Saigas, takes a bit of work. 

I have a bunch of extras, a few 10 and 12 round mags and a 20 round drum, single point sling, quad rail, collapsible stock, fore grip - it gathers a crowd at the range every time. 

Unfortunately I don't have any photos here at work, but if you have been surfing armslist for a while you have seen it. I posted an ad for it a few months ago, it had coyote brown furniture on it. I will post pics when I get home. 

I love the gun and Im not desperate so don't bother with lowball offers, armslist is plagued by people who think they are going to pay pennies on the dollar - it baffles me. 

I am looking to trade for handguns and/or a complete upper for an AR. I am building  an AR and have a spikes tactical lower so if by some crazy chance you have a spikes upper, I would have a hard time saying no. 

All in all, not including the incredible amount of money spent on ammo, I have about $1600 invested in this gun. Im not one of those people who is trying to inflate the price with false rumors about stopping production or an ATF ban, but Im also not interested in taking a bath on my investment. 

Here is a fun video that shows the potential of a Saiga really gets the blood pumping http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzErujpv0sU

I found a picture of the gun in my email, its not great but you get the general idea

I might throw in a couple cases of 00buck shells as I wont be needing them. Im not sure how many I have but I will take a look.

One last thing. This gun is a monster and I am going to be very picky about who I sell it to. If I turn you down because I dont like the feel I get and you really want it then we can do the sale through the shooters sport center in Racine and you can pick up the charges."

She's built on a Spike's Tactical Lower (never been a rifle, purchased as an ""other""), DPMS Parts Kit, pistol tube/foam cover and buffer, and a 7"" 1:9 twist free float 4-rail upper (M4 Profile flat top). She's currently wearing rail covers on three sides with a Magpul AFG on the bottom. For the haters, the AFG is perfectly legal on pistol builds per recent ATF letter (provided with sale, or feel free to ""Google"" it). The red dot is a no-name sample (appears to be a BSA red dot clone) riding on a low-level riser to bring it up to good cheek weld height - it functions wonderfully and holds zero perfectly. There's a Blackhawk grip, winter trigger guard, Blackhawk single point storm sling, and 1 Brownells 30rd mag also included. Bolt and bolt carrier are no-names, but nicely smoothed in and extremely functional. She's had about 500-600 rounds through her for break-in, and she now functions flawlessly on Lake City 5.56 M855 and Federal .223.

This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. I have much more invested in this weapon than my asking price. 


I also have a custom dpms AR-15 that I will sell with the saiga for $1900. This does not include the md arms 20 round drum for the saiga. I will sell it with the package for an extra $50."

My son and I just finished replacing his.  Not much fun, but is sure looks good.  Now that we know how to do it, I thought I'd post this up here and see if anyone wants theirs done.

Brand new replacement dash top for the 98-02 (02 2500 and 3500 only) Dodge Ram. The one I'm selling is Agate Gray or dark gray. Just finished installing one on my son's 01 ram and it is perfect. This is the upper shell only, does not include the piece around the instrument cluster. The dash does have to be removed to replace this, as the vents are screwed in from the underside. The dash assembly was built on a line and then installed in the truck as a complete unit, so the genius's at Dodge really didn't care how much fun it would be to replace the top of the dash. 

I can install for a total of $550.00, provided the rest of your dash isn't destroyed as well. (that's parts and labor)

This is not one of those cheap cover pads that you glue down, it is exactly as the factory original, but a better plastic. The fit and look are amazing.

Pros : great pistol shoots accurate, larger clone of the 9mm version, recoil springs are great, integrated safeties are a trademark of the XDm line of pistols
Cons : too big for small hands.  I am a shorter guy and this would not be my choice or a CCW.

The backstory :  my wife wants a pistol and I am going to get her a we XDm 9mm, since she definitely won't Ike it since she has smaller hands than I do.   The only catch is that I do not want an extra pistol, I'd rather trade, especially with the cost of ammo.

The catch : nothing...this pistol has 100 rounds max through it.  Bought NEW, still has all XDm gear, holster, 2 mags, loader, a mag holder...

The actual magazine is removable from the sleeve with a simple pull and could then be used in any Ruger 10/22. With the sleeve installed it is designed to have the look of a larger caliber magazine when used with the Marauder Kit (which simulates the look and feel of the H&K G36).

The one magazine pictured in the package case is a brand new magazine that has never been used or loaded. It is still in its original unopened case. This is the newest version with double steel pins and which has been proven to be 100% reliable. The other is a used magazine that is an earlier version and did (for me) have some reliability issues. These magazines are easily taken apart including the feed lips which replacement feed lips are sold by Promag and can be easily installed.

These are available for local pick-up or will ship via UPS at cost.
Both Magazines are offered here for the total price of $42.
