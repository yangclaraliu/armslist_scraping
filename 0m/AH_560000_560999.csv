Basically in brand new condition - I tore it completely down, sandblasted the old finish, hand sanded some areas, resprayed it with matte black Duracoat and clear engine enamel, rebuilt it, and replaced the sear spring. I also sanded the stock grips and resprayed them with plastic-adhering paint. 

I haven't shot it since rebuilding it, but there is absolutely no doubt it will fire perfectly, since everything functions properly, i.e. the trigger engages properly in DA/SA, the hammer falls, the safey works, etc. We can meet at a range if you're unsure.

The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13” length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4” – 14.5” LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights.

I have a Remington Sparta 310 shotgun for sale.  It is made by Baikal and imported through EAA for Remington.  It is in like new condition, and looks and shoots great. The pictures do not do the gun justice. Comes with information manual and 4 chokes tubes. This gun is a real workhorse with several very nice features: selective barrel, single trigger, and you can turn 2 screws and either have the shells eject or extract so you can use them to reload.  The barrels are 28"" long and shoots like a dream.  It takes both 2 3/4 and 3"" shells.  If you have any questions or would like more information, please e-mail.  You are also most welcome to come look at it any time.  Reasonable offers will be considered.  I will be trading it off in about a week if it has not sold."

This is a collectors grade rifle. No re-arsenal markings or signs of refurbishment anywhere on this rifle. It has all matching numbers on the bolt, carrier, stock, receiver, receiver cover, magazine, trigger guard, rear sight, and gas tube. It has the original blade bayonet, original cleaning rod, original cleaning kit, 10 stripper clips, 200 rounds of Russian match grade 7.62x39 ammo, and case. The bore is bright and shiny with strong rifling. The bluing is original and none of the pats have been painted over later. The stock is its original dark hardwood finish and has the original serial number without being forced matched and having a bunch of XXXXX's over the old serial number. The stock has no cracks or deep gouges, just minor handling wear. The receiver cover is marked with the Tula star inside the star logo and has the date stamp of 1952r under the logo. I bought this gun over a year and a half ago and it has sat in the safe ever since. I have never fired it, and never planned to in order to keep it in the collectors condition it is currently in. I know what this gun is worth as would any serious SKS collector so please don't try to low ball me and compare this with the Yugo's and Norinco's out there. Take a look at gunbroker for similar condition rifles and you will see that there are few out there and are worth every bit of my asking price. 

Bottom dollar price is $550 FIRM.  I am located in Dublin and if you want to buy this, you must be willing to meet me in this area. My job doesn't typically allow me time to travel beyond the Dublin area. If interested, email me. Thanks for looking."

Gun is super accurate and the scope is very nice. Holds zero like no other. I would shoot a 3 shot group to make sure it was on, then 1 at a deer and be done with it for a year. Deer do not go very far after being hit with this gun, plenty of power for anything you are looking to hunt.

Custom built by STI. This is not a commercially available pistol.

I have an STI 1911 9mm that I had custom built by STI.

It cost $1645.00 to have built by STI. I have the STI receipt for this. It was built at the end of June this year, so is only a couple of months old. I have only had time to fire about 200 rds to date, so it is not even broken in yet.

Comes with box, 3 9rd mags with base pads, 1 12rd mag, manual, lock, STI bushing wrench.

Also comes with a .40S&W barrel and 2 8rd .40S&W mags. I have not used them yet.

It has Bo-Mar adjustable Tritium Night Sights.

It shoots like butter. I had STI set the trigger to 3.5lbs. It breaks crisp and clean. The slide to frame fit is perfect. 

I had this pistol built for competition shooting, but my job duties and family responsibilities have changed, and I no longer have time to do it, and other things have come up and I have decided to sell it.

A bill of sale will be needed for this transaction.

New slide, new polymer frame, all new springs, new trigger assembly, new mag release, new extractor, new barrel, and they polished the feed ramp.  This firearm is back to the condition I purchased it in thanks to Kel Tec.  Great for CCW and has the belt clip attached to the frame pins.  Comes with 3 mags total, 1 8rd, 2 7rd with pinky extensions. This is one of the easiest CCW guns around as it is slim and light but still 9mm.

Hard to let this one go... Low 5 digit serial number dates it to 1895 if I recall my research correctly, which was the first year 30 WCF was made. What separates this one from the enormous herd of the millions of 1894s out there is the combination of the date of manufacture, and the condition. It seems like you can find old ones, and you can find nice ones, but hard to find both in the same gun sometimes. Look at the pictures, and judge for yourself. There is a notch in the top of the stock. Nice, very smooth metal throughout. Bore has very strong rifling but does have some light roughness to it, although some of it might clean up a bit. I have owned this for years and I have fired it on one occasion. I probably put 20 rounds or so through it, and had a blast. Function was perfect. The action is nice and tight, especially for 117 year old gun. This isnt a perfect gun but I do think this surpasses a vast majority of ones you see come up for sale. Its just a very nice, honest 1894 that is in well above average condition.

The receivers are a MEGA ARMS MATEN ambidextrious set and the barrel is one of the hard to find 20"" Rainier arms ultramatch beaded stainless ones. It is held on by a DD barrel nut and has a DD Lite Rail (7.62) in rifle length on it. The gas block is a match grade one from rainier with a rifle length gas tube. I also installed a SJC titan comp in stainless...which is apparently the best recoil reducing comp out there. I spent about $300 on the match grade ar308 gold trigger. The lower parts are Rock river, and the safety selector is a Battle Arms development BAD-ASS ambi safety selector. The gun has a dpms  buffer tube with a Magpul 308 PRS stock  and miad grip. I bought about the best buffer I could find (a slash heavy 308 buffer) for the least recoil...this buffer works well with suppressors if you have a permit and own one. I also have 4 pmags and a hard case. I will include a hard chrome DPMS bolt carrier for the said price.

If you look the parts up you will see that this gun would cost around $3k for all parts and installation.

It's easy to see why when you look at the sleek lines, as well as the practical features; they make this pistol a formidable fighting weapon.

One of the new features includes the introduction of a new one-piece fully machined mainspring / magwell combination cut from a 2.5"" block of tool steel. Rather than coming to a sharp point at the base of the grip, the integrated mainspring housing / magwell is rounded for comfort while not sacrificing any grip length. It assists in reducing print thru to clothing as you carry concealed.

Sights are the new Heinie Ledge which allows you to use the rear sight to cycle the slide with one hand. Three ball-radius cuts run the full length of the slide top to direct your eyes quickly to the front sight.

The rear cocking serrations are a series of eight ball-radius cuts per side instead of the normal serration pattern. The rear of the slide is hand-serrated at 40lpi which matches the rear of the Heinie Ledge Sight. The barrel bushing is an extra thick variety which is chamfered around the edges. The front of the slide has been recessed where the front cocking serrations would normally be, and the barrel is crowned to complete its custom look.

Grips are black G10s with a golf-ball dimple pattern and the Nighthawk logo.

Barrel is a NH proprietary gunsmith-fit Match-Grade stainless steel barrel.

The FCG has been moved forward and a US Made TAPCO G2 FCG has been installed.

US MADE TAPCO butt stock and SAW pistol grip have been installed. US made AK 74 style muzzle break installed. Paint has been touched up with a solvent resistant Ceramic based paint.

A bullet guide has been added that lets you use less expensive aftermarket hi cap magazines such as the 30 round magazine in the photo.

The gun handles flawlessly as all guns modified by our gunsmiths go to the range for testing and 30 rounds put through them before shipping.

Legion imported.

In 1974 The Russian Army replaced the 7.62x39 with this caliber. The round is lighter to carry and has less recoil than a 7.62x39 but it has a high velocity. There is an abundance of cheap surplus ammo in this caliber. You can find ammo for around 11 cents a round. Since there is less recoil it's easier to stay on target with a follow up shot as there is less muzzle jump. This Saiga rifle can fire in quick succession due to the energy that escapes from the barrel bore to the gas cylinder. The Saiga-5.45x39 auto loading hunting rifles are intended for hunting big and medium-sized game under various climatic conditions. The rifles are developed on the base of the venerable Kalashnikov assault rifle and are chambered for the following cartridge: Saiga-5.45x39 cartridge, this rifle won't let you down.

Glashaus Warranty  
Here at Glashaus Firearms we stand behind our work. However, a builder’s warranty is only good if the customer takes advantage of it...

To ensure that less scrupulous individuals do not use our commitment to Quality work to take advantage of us, some guidelines have been established

1. If you have a problem with a Glashaus Firearms built weapon. Notify us as soon as the problem manifests itself. We’ll probably ask the usual round of questions. The warranty period is 30 days. Waiting months or years to bring up a problem, or bringing it up on a public Internet forum as a smear will negate your warranty.

2. ANY home gunsmithing, modification, grinding, filing, drilling, hammering etc… negates your warranty.

3. Glashaus Firearms will not offer, nor reimburse customers; either initial or subsequent buyers of Glashaus Firearms built weapons, for their shipping TO Glashaus Firearms for work to be completed. Glashaus Firearms will, however, pay for return shipping once warranty work is done.

4. If Glashaus Firearms offers to repair a weapon that we’ve worked on, and advises customer to send it back, and customer does not, but rather sends weapon to ANOTHER smith/builder for his critique or evaluation. Please do not insult us by expecting us to pay for it.

5. Warranties are handled by the manufacturer. Warranty claims need to be directed to the manufacturer, as warranties are between the owner (that's you) and the warrantor. However if you need service or warranty work on a new piece of equipment and need our help in accessing them, we will be glad to answer any questions or help you get in contact with the right party. No refunds on firearms if transferred. Once transferred, it’s USED. Inspect the weapon at the dealer! Shipping and Handling is not refundable.

Glashaus Firearms does not assume any liability for typographical errors and incorrect pricing. We reserve the right to cancel any orders due to the errors listed above."

This is a Mauser Modelo Argentino 1909 in bolt action 25-06 cal. This particular rifle was my father's and he remounted and finished the stock himself.  I don't know much about the rifle itself except that he hardly ever shot it in the 38 years that I have been alive.  What I do know is that the Mauser Modelo 1909 replaced the 1891 and is a superbly made bolt action military and represents the crown jewel of the Model 98 variants.

It features an extremely beautiful auburn tiger wood stock contrasting wonderfully against the blued barrel and fixtures.  There are some very minor parts of the gun that need to be polished up but all the actions seem to be very smooth and the trigger pull is very light.  

Included with this rifle is a basic scope and a hard plastic travel/storage case.  If I have some ammunition and/or magazines for it, I will throw those in with the rifle."

Description

The Remington Model 700 BDL is a bolt-action hunting rifle chambered in 12 different cartridges. The Model 700 was introduced by Remington in 1962 and has since been expanded to include more than 30 sub-models. The BDL is considered a deluxe model like the Model 700 CDL, but what makes the BDL different is its Monte Carlo stock with a raised cheekpiece and the fact that it has sights.

Remington says the Model 700's action forms ""three rings of steel,"" meaning it uses a push-feed action where the bolt pushes the round towards the chamber and the extractor does not grab the rim of the cartridge until the bolt is completely forward and locked. It doesn't affect the smoothness of the action, but does cater to one's preference. Some prefer the push-feed action over a control-round feed action (which does the opposite). Also, according to Remington, the Model 700's receiver was milled from a single piece of steel, so it'll be more resistant to wear overtime than those not milled from a single piece of steel. A durable receiver is necessary especially when absorbing the force of the initial explosion that sets off heavier loads.

The Model 700 BDL features a carbon steel barrel with a high polish blue finish and the stock is American walnut with a glossy finish. It has a checkered fore-end and a padded butt. The BDL is equipped with Remington's patented X-Mark Pro adjustable trigger system, which has a pull weight of 3.5 pounds with two pounds of adjustment to suit the shooter's individual needs. What's unique about the X-Mark Pro trigger system is that it can be adjusted externally. The Model 700 BDL is also equipped with a hinged floorplate magazine, and an adjustable rear and hooded front sights."

Its a great gun, never had any problems with it very reliable I never had to clean it and it always worked.  This is the shotgun the US Army tested and was found to be the only one to fire over 750 thousand rounds without jamming or breaking.  They dropped it out of a C-130 at 15,000 feet and it still functioned, and found it can shoot underwater down to 350 feet as well.  This is fully loaded, it has the tactile barrel shroud to keep you from brning yourself when things gets hot and heavy ;) I have done some special mods myself including the tacticle side shell holder which lts you carry extra shells and load quick.  A little trick keep the shells in it ""upside down"" and they go in quicker. ;) Altogether it is a great gun for anything from hunting to protection to combat... its perfect for what we used to call ""wet work"". ;)  Lets just say Ive been some bad placesw and if I was to have a good shotgun by my side this would be the one. Wanting to sale for $300 or trade for some kind of asshat type rifle like an AK-47, M1A1, SOCOM, , Mac 10, Spaz-12, Calico, PP90, etc.  But NO F'N POODLE SHOOTERS. SOrry for the french but they got too many guys I know killed is all.  Anyway liek I said this one wont let you down, if you want a tacticle asshalt type gun but can still hunt with it this is the one you want.  As a bonus I will throw in 6 shells, these are the ones I always carry on the side holder.  2 armor peircing SABIT slugs, 2 BOLAS chain shells, and 2 ""special"" ones I will just ahve to show you in person.  Lets just say there wont be much left afterwords ;) Oh and I have a bag of hollow point slugs, a couple I drilled out extra for when you really want to give somebody a bad day LOL :)  To tell you the truth the shells are almost worth what Im asking, those are impossible to find since the ban.  Oh and FYI this is pre-ban, unregistered with no papers, no questions asked. I can throw in some extra cash if you have a good trade.  NO LOW BALLS if nobody wants it for the price I might just keep it and throw the new chainsaw grip on it and call it good.  But I promise you wont find a better shotgun.

Sorry for the picture its just a quick one from my cellphone.  Email me if your interested and I can send you some better ones.
