Here's your chance to put away a complete package to hedge against zombies, the great New Madrid earthquake or an Obama law that makes AKs illegal for import. This is a Saiga AK that has been legally converted to take military magazines. If you don't know what a Saiga is, it's the only way to get a new, Russian-made AK-47 made in the same factory as Russian military rifles. Other AKs you see in the US are made in Croatia, or Bulgaria - eastern-bloc guns that are converted cheaply and crudely.

This AK features an ACE folding stock for easy storage and a Krebs peep rear sight - the best you can buy. Over $650 invested in the gun alone, not counting the 4 magazines or the ammo. All in all this package is worth well over $800. If our incumbent president is re-elected, the value may very well go up dramatically. If you don't own a high-cap fighting rifle, get one today!

ALSO includes 4 30-round mags and 500 rounds of ammo in an ammo can.

This AK is completely legal to own and is fully 922r compliant. Must be 18 yrs old and not a felon. You will need to provide an ID and verify that you are not a felon nor are barred from owning a rifle for any reason."

This caliber has about 80% of the power of the 308 cartridge and has very little if any felt recoil. The bolt has been modified to be able to fire all military surplus ammo and anything else you decide to feed it. This rifle has the quad rail free float hand guards and a 6 position stock.

Here is the back story on the mower.

1. I'm getting rid of it because my neighbor and I went in on a Dixie Chopper mower and I don't need this one anymore

2. I bought it in 2006 and used it every year up until 2010 when I bought the new mower.  Since 2010 It's been stored inside on a concrete floor.  From 2006 to 2010 it was stored under a carport on gravel.  The guy I bought it from kept it in a barn.

3. I've hung on to this one because I've seen them repainted and they look sharp, I refinish guns for a hobby so I thought I'd eventually get around to repainting this.  In the last 2.5 years my wife and I have had two kids.  It is now very obvious it will be years before I get around to repainting this mower.

4. During the time I owned it I made one significant repair, in either 2009 or 2010 I had a local guy rebuild the carburetor.  Other than that one oil change per year and blades sharpened once in a while.

5. Up for trade are the:
The SS12 Tractor-Model #917.65370 Serial #1260
The Deck 54""-Model #917.253161
The Plow- Model #917.251382
Two extra rear wheels with AG tires (tires are no good)
Two sets of tire chains
Four wheel weights
One extra mule drive
6. The pulley cover for the engine is in my shed.  I took a picture of it and the extra mule drive but I don't remember why it isn't on the mower.
7. Known problems:
It has not been started for two years, I'm sure the battery is dead and the fuel will have to be drained.
The left front tire isn't holding air.
There is surface rust on most of it.  There are no soft spots and the only scaling rust is a little on the plow and it isn't very deep.  
I'm sure it will need anything any other mower would need that hasn't been started in that long"

This holster has always been kept in a warm dry place and very well taken care of. It would make a great usable field holster. (THIS LISTING HAS A PICTURE OF A BLACKHAWK PISTOL.

Product Features:

1.25"" Long Magazine Extension For The Ruger LCP .380

First Grip To Accomodate All Three Fingers OF A Man's Hand

Helps To Reduce Painful Kickback When Shooting.

Still Fits Nicely In An Average Pocket And Helps Prevent Shifting In Pocket.

This Product Does Not Increase Magazine Capacity.

A Little Background......

Every after market grip extension I ran across only fit 2 to 2 1/2 fingers. Seeing I couldn't find an extension that fit anywhere on the market, I designed my own. With 2 years in planning, design and development of injection molds for 8 different small caliber models, I'm now selling the best grip extension for the money on Ebay to recoup the cost and maybe receive some of the fruits for my labor! I didn't skimp on design, tolerances or quality of materials. They fit all my fingers perfectly now and they look and perform great! I think you will agree.

Now for the design features: Because of the 1.25"" long grip, I now have better control which helps me to be more accurate and feeling more secure that I am more efficient for me and those around me. Second, because of a longer more evenly distributed grip handle, the kick no longer hurts my hand in the cradle area between the thumb and forefinger.

What else is there? There's one more thing. When I carry in my pocket holster, the longer than average grip extension stabilizes the position of the handle so it won't shift to a position that makes it hard to pull out. It stays just where I put it instead of the handle migrating to the side or even bottom of my pocket. This wasn't something that I designed into the product. It just happened to be a benefit I discovered by accident when I started using the new grip. Results may vary for you. I am bigger than the average bear and I wear relaxed fit jeans. This makes it very easy to conceal ""For Me"". You need to figure out your own methods.

Combining the best of thumbhole and pistol grip designs, our new ShurShot stock affords right and left handed shooters equally astounding levels of shooting comfort and rock steady aim. It was developed to meet the demands of deer, turkey and predator hunts. Namely, increased maneuverability and extended-range precision.

 The natural, ergonomic pistol grip optimizes pointability and works in conjunction with the revolutionary new SuperCell recoil pad to cancel felt recoil for more accurate first shots and faster follow ups. Its an ultra lightweight design and the comb is specially contoured for rapid eye alignment with your sights or scope.

 Proving to be one of the most lethal developments in shotgun technology since the 3 1/2 12 gauge chambering, the new ShurShot stock is redefining lethal range and handling ease."

Illinois sales only, buyer MUST have valid Illinois Foid card and sign bill of sale. Will not sell to anyone in Chicago. Low Ballers, bother some one else. in response to the guy that wrote me as to why I wont sell to people in chicago heres your answer.... the reason i wont sell to chicago residents is because you guys HAVE TO REGISTER YOUR GUNS WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT and if i sell you a gun and you dont do your part in registering the gun i just sold you, the very gun that is still in my name, and lets say it got stolen from your house and some thug went out and committed a crime shot and killed some one with the gun that i sold you THATS STILL IN MY NAME, well guess what im fucked! according to chicago im just as responsible for the crime just as much as the low life thug that actually pulled the trigger and im off doing years in prison, thats why i dont sell to chicago residents, who in the hell needs that headache? im not gonna sit here and worrie and hope  that you resistor the gun i just sold you, so yea no chicago sales."""

Flli Pietra .36 Cal. Black Powder 
I came across this sweet looking gun, and really know nothing much at all about it. What we have here a beautiful Flli Pietta - Made in Italy .36 cal. Black Powder Gun. Has assorted markings on it? BZ in a box, PN with a star over it, 2 crossed 16 May 1643 on it, says also Engraved by W.L. Oresby New York & Patent No., but no number is there? Beautiful wood grips have some initials on on side, just can not figure out what they are. I read that this is their Colt type version of this gun. Also that they can be converted to a regular shell type gun. Serial number is # 525461, it is a beautiful gold frame and black barrel and cylinder. When cocked the trigger has notch to use as sight when lined up with little gold ball at end of barrel. She is in georgous condition. A little bar knocks out to remove the cylinder, I'm told this is a cap and ball type blackpowder gun, a 6 shooter. Personally I love this thing , but one I don't do Black Powder, two I don't have the money to convert it to a real bullet shooting cowboy gun, and third I would really rather have something I can actually use to carry or what-ever. Would like to trade for something.

Remington Model 1100 Auto 12 guage Shotgun

Remington Model 1100 Auto 12 guage Shotgun. 20'' modified barrel on it with one site bead. Shoots only 2 3/4 shells, has wood stock. She is old and shows her years of use, but is in excellent working condition. This was the days of changing barrels instead of chokes, so it also comes with a 29'' Skeet barrel with 2 site beads on it. Again shows years of use, but no rust. This lady has taken her share of clay birds and game, oh and loads of crow. Were I back in NY by the skeet ranges I would never part with her, but in the 12 years I'm down south I have not shot skeet once, so she is just taking up space in the safe. My loss is your gain.

you can’t get this gun anywhere around the valley for less than $149.00 to $169.00 +tax for this new in the box gun. Right now you can look on GA and see this same gun for $149.00 + $20 shipping + ffl fees, this same gun is selling right now on GB for $139.00+ $20 shipping+ ffl fees, so you cant get this gun anywhere with these extras and with all the work already done for you for a better price than my asking price. 
Im not desperate to sell to pay bills or anything, I just found a gun I like better and don’t need 2 of these, so Im asking a fair price but I wont give it away.

Taught by active, full time Police Officer
Teaching CCH since 2007

I have real-world experience and teach from that perspective. I add to the basic curriculum to help better prepare students for the challenges of concealed carry and the
potential use of deadly force.

We cover CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Armed Response / Self Defense, Interaction with Law Enforcement and much more.

This is an excellent class taught by a knowledgeable instructor with a bit more than the AG CCH Instructor certification.

Certified CCH Instructor
NRA Instructor
Self Defense / Armed Response Instructor
Taser Instructor
30 years of experience

Many instructors base there classes on things learned in books and pseudo tactical as seen on TV
My instruction is based on proven and experienced technique and instruction

If you are considering a CCH class just ask yourself: Do you want to learn from someone with true experience in armed conflict, or a used car salesman who decided to teach CCH?

I have the opportunity to interact with many CCH holders and have found that many times the information they received was inaccurate and sometimes dangerous.

I believe in CCH and that is why I teach. IF you are wanting to carry a firearm, just be sure you ask questions of your instructor; their philosophy and true credentials. It is easy to become a CCH instructor, but it takes experience in armed conflict to offer what is really required.

IOR Valdada 2.5x10x42 Tactical Scope with the MP8 Range finding Reticle (pictured). The reticle in this scope is in the FIRST FOCAL PLANE (reticle shrinks and grows as power settings are changed), which means the user can use the MP8 reticle (reticle is “etched” into the glass) to determine range at ANY POWER SETTING. This increased flexibility is very valuable in the tactical and competition environments. This scope features a 30mm main tube and internal lenses from SCHOTT GLASS (Same glass used in Zeiss and Schmidt and Bender scopes). Another nice feature of this scope is that the target turrets are set in ½ M.O.A adjustments, which is ideal for more rapid range adjustment in tactical shooting (1/2 the clicks of a ¼ moa turret). This scope features 88 M.O.A. of adjustment, plenty to reach 1000 yards with most calibers. This IOR scopes scope is covered by IOR’s lifetime warranty.

This sight has red dot sight and an IR laser that can be triggered by a remote switch. This sight is metal not plastic, and is used by Israeli and some US forces. This sight also uses easy to find AA batteries, and I am including a lithium AA battery and hard case. Some say that it is better than an Eotech, and I agree, but everyone has an opinion. I used one during my deployment and it performed great, that's why I bought one for my M4. This sight sells new for around 1,200.00 but I am asking 1000.00, but I will take serious offers. You may find one cheaper, but it will be the red laser not the IR laser. If you low-ball me with an offer I will not reply. Like most of us this is a toy I have to sell because I need the money. I will have links with more information about the sight below. For pictures see the craigslist post.  If you have any questions feel free to ask.

These were very popular & inexpensive, yet very well built guns favored by younger shooters, farmers, & guys with gun racks in their trucks...back in the day when you could do that stuff.
 These guns were made for many years since being introduced in 1937 & came in .410/16/20/& 12 ga.- & If you have one in 28 ga. please call me!
 I've had several of these over the years & still have a couple around. They were made in different styles, and can best be dated by these changes as this was before serial #'s were required & the Gubmint had real jobs (for the most part). 
 Many were made in 12 ga. & the 'Long Tom' or 'Goose Gun' 32"" barrels are kinda rare on the 12's but can be found. But try finding a 20 ga. with a 32"" Barrel! 
 The closest I've ever come to locating another one was some  annecdotal 'evidence' (from a guy that should know),  who once told me that he saw one once in @ Tulsa a gun show.
 A good friend that owns New Mexico's largest gun shop for over 40 yrs. ain't never seen one...& he gets EVERYTHING! The back room is a freaking Museum!
 Seems there are more Extraterrestrial Unicorn Jockies around than long barreled Winchester 20 gauge Model 37's....(Especially since they started a Union).
 So if any of you Old Codgers (or even 'Next Generation' Codgers), Winchester Collectors/Ex-Employees, Farmers with 'Widecab' GunRax, Skeet Shooters, Powder Monkeys, (Girl;) Strippers, or anyone else out there have any info or interest in this so far unfound in any catalog or reference ol' 20 ga. - Please drop me a line.
 If you think I need to sell it to you or you want to trade something else that's cool-....then that's cool too. 
 Warning: I can be pretty stubborn & sure don't need it gone but I really like old S&Dubyas. Or silver's good too. Oh, a 1911 might work too....Aah, just Email me. 
  I'm happy to send detailed photos/info to interested parties.
 Gun is original; not the early 'Pigtail' lever but the 2nd type lever/hammer (40's/50's style), has the old style WRA butt plate, regular M37 'Steelbuilt' barrel adress, great bore, brass bead front sight, nice walnut stock/forearm, is in typical used but not abused condition, nothing too remarkable....but that looong barrel!"

Rifle has all parts including 2@ 15 round magazines, the sling and oiler.
Also included is one 30 round USGI magazine.

Rifle shows age in bluing and on the stock, but is 100% functional.
It has only been 18 months since I did a full strip down, rebuilt the bolt (if you have ever worked on an M1 bolt you know what that entails!) and replaced most springs.

I'll also throw in a new box of Remington 110 gr SP ammo.
I am an avid reloader of over 30 calibers so I prefer to use low power ammo when plinking and save the full load ammo for hunting.
I'll probably never hunt with a 30 carbine, but the kicker is that being a southpaw the brass from my reduced power loads ding me in the forehead.
Factory ammo does as expected and flies over my shoulder no matter which hand I shoot with.
My safe is too full, so it is time for this one to move on to a new home.
The M1 Carbine is a lot of fun and I hope whoever purchases this enjoys it as much as I and everyone who handled her have had!

I will require proof of residency by Drivers License or State Identification card and will provide a bill of sale (copies for each)."

Standard finish, has Trijicon HD night sights on the gun but can have the gunsmith swap the OEM sights back if you so desire. 

I paid $649.00 + Tax at B&T late winter or early spring, added the night sights for about $125.00.


XDm w/ OEM sights $550.00

XDm w/ Trjicon HD's $675.00


Either way I'll include all the original XDm gear and case, the OEM 9rd & 13rd mags.

I also have an additional two mags, 1-10rd from an XD compact, 1-13 rd fullsize mag. I'll sell these for an additional $40.00

Gun runs great with all various JHP loads I tried, No scratches in the finish etc, one small holster wear mark which I can't even pick up in a photo. The compact 45 acp XDm's are pretty tough to come by hence the higher price than the 9mm's & 40's. 

Not really looking for trades right now except maybe a Remington 870 12 gauge with a 28"" barrel + cash."
