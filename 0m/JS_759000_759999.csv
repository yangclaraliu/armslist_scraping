Also included is an eotech 512 model that takes double A batteries. The diodes in the eotech are fading a bit. It's hard to see them in heavy light. I'm not particularly sure what the issue is but it could be a battery connection problem or it could need to be refurbished by eotech. From what I have been told, if the sight is in warranty, it will be replaced or repaired for free. If it's not, it will cost you $58 to have it completely refurbished. Nonetheless, it still works fine in lower levels of light. Also included is a Vector Optics green laser. This is a very high quality laser and is extremely bright. The laser alone cost me a pretty penny. Also included will be one, 50 round magazine. I will consider partial trades for steel AK magazines, 7.62x39, and perhaps a few other things that I need. Sell will occur in or around the Salisbury area. I will ship the rifle if you are from another state but it will be at your cost.

here is what i am looking for .. AR-10  with a 308/7.65 barrel to use both types of ammo for myself and a ruger 10.22 for the kid    
this would be the perfect deal .. but feel free to make offers of what ever it is you think might make my ears pop up and eyes light up 


 I value this at $2500-$3000     It is a 92Honda XR600R, It has a 200watt ricky stator in it and regulator ( $250), new only one tank of fuel through it acribus 5.8 gallon tank ($260), only 100 miles on the shinko 244 tires($150), pro-cycle dual sport kit and harness($350), tall soft foam seat with grippy cover($60). Still have the original seat, still has an original paper sticker on the frame ( i.e. low hours, this should not still be there ) the only issue it has is I blew the fork seals out when I was transporting it back from my last exploring ride, so it will need fork seals replaced ( $15 job if you do it yourself $  200 if you pay someone) has aftermarket Probend hand guards ($120 ).. it’s in real good shape. Starts second/third kick on a cold day...first / second kick on a warm day.. I have always run the fuel out of the carb before parking it after a ride so the carb is clean..  oil changed after every other ride. clean title,
I used this for putting around the dirt roads around my area no hard of road use no jumping..... 
I look forward to seeing if we can make a deal.

Still have the original seat, still has an original paper sticker on the frame ( i.e. low hours, this should not still be there ) the only issue it has is I blew the fork seals out when I was transporting it back from my last exploring ride, so it will need fork seals replaced ( $15 job if you do it yourself $  200 if you pay someone) has aftermarket Probend hand guards ($120 ).. it’s in real good shape. Starts second/third kick on a cold day...first / second kick on a warm day.. I have always run the fuel out of the carb before parking it after a ride so the carb is clean..  oil changed after every other ride. clean title,
I used this for putting around the dirt roads around my area no hard of road use no jumping..... 
I look forward to seeing if we can make a deal.

Message me number or email and lets meet San Antonio face to face. Ammo is scarce for AR15s right now. Can't find it anywhere online and this is good stuff.

Features and Benefits

5.56 NATO caliber
55 grains
150-round box


This is high quality brass ammo for your AR-15. Don't spend a ton of money on an AR then skimp and get crap on the ammo. This is also re-loadable unlike all the steel crap most are selling and if there really is a ban this brass will be very valuable for reloading.

The AK receivers made in Romania and is Brand New – not made of used parts.
The M10-762 has a brand-new,  Hammer Forged chrome-lined 16.25"" barrel, with a 1:10 twist rate, with four lands and grooves, with a right-hand twist.

The overall length of this gun is 26"" 

The rifle weighs-in at 7.3 pounds

The M10-762 takes all standard AK-47 magazines, and the rifle is supplied with one magazine. It has a TAPCO RAZR muzzle brake/flash suppressor on the end of the barrel. The RAZR can also be used as a ""compliance"" device because of the super-sharp cut to the brake. 

The pistol grip is outstanding. This rubber covered pistol grip is not only larger than the standard AK pistol grip, but it is perfectly configured to fit the hand if you ask me. If there is a better pistol grip out there for an AK, then I haven't found it. 

The stock is USA-made (by TAPCO) and is black synthetic of some sort. 

The fore end on the M10-762 is an aluminum quad-rail type, firmly attached, so you can mount lasers, lights and red dot optics on it if you choose - and this is a really nice quad-rail, to be sure.  

The front sight is mounted on the gas block, instead of on the end of the barrel. This gives you a slightly shorter sighting radius,  

The rear sight is an RPK graduated fully adjustable for windage and elevation sight that adjusts all the way up to 1,000 meters..

A TAPCO single-hook trigger is installed in the M10-762, and I think this is the best after-market AK trigger you can have in an AK. The let-off was right at 4 pounds on my sample and it was very smooth, too. 

A TAPCO AK retaining plate is used to keep the trigger pin and safety pin in place - a much better set-up than the simple bent spring that comes with most AKs these days. 

The lower receiver is stamped and heat-treated to military specs. 

There is also a quick-detachable scope mount base on the left side of the receiver if you want to mount a scope.

The rifle does have a couple of cosmetic issues on the finish to the suppressor from some idiot trying to wrench off the faux suppressor. Considering the blemishes, it would make a perfect sbr rifle because it has a true 9"" 3 lug barrel under the faux suppressor to bring to the legal 16"" length, or you could touch-up the finish or wrap the suppressor part of the barrel. Either way, the price shall reflect the blemishes. This rifle is fully compatible with all HK furniture and internal parts.

Maybe 15 rounds down barrel, enough to zero scope in at 150 yards dead accurate. 
Nice Burris scope
Its a jaw dropper when pulled out in range. 
New lower Pistol grip and trigger
Adjustable bipod (real nice)

I have 95 Hornady rounds with rifle. (About $150 worth)

The rifle recoil is more like a push (rifle know as the thumper) than the hit a user would expect from a regular rifle. Hornady and Remington both now manufacture ammunition for the rifle.

Ballistically the round is very flat out to 200 yards. If the firearm is zeroed at 150 yards, the user can expect to see a rise of 1.8 inches at 100 yards, zero at 150 yards and a drop of 2.4 inches at 200 yards. This rifle has a free floating barrel making it extremely accurate—it is capable of 1 MOA

For sale is a limited and rare VEPR II AK-47 in 7.62x39mm that was made in Russia, at Vyatskie Polyany Machine Building Plant ""Molot"".,

These were only imported into the United States for a a few years, in small quantities, by Robinson Arms. It is designed to accept authentic AK47 magazines as a factory built rifle. This is NOT the type later imported in much larger quantities that were modified with thumbhole stocks and restricted to accept only 10 round magazines. 

It has never been fired, and comes with all original accessories, including sling, manual, Russian rifle cleaning kit, and I am including 5 steel AK 30 round magazines with this rifle.

This VEPR II has a 20"" heavy barrel, black polymer furniture, and for those who do not know, is built upon a RPK receiver, which is incredibly rigid (as it is used for the Russian version of the squad automatic weapon).

This VEPR II is NOT the ones later imported with thumbhole stocks and restricted to accept only 10 round magazines. It is not modified in any way. It is designed to accept authentic AK47 magazines as a factory built rifle.

These were imported for a very short period of time, and are considered the H&K of AKs. Try to find one like this, let alone one that is new in box! 

This rifle will only be shipped to a FFL in a state where this rifle is legal to purchase and own, or it can be purchased within Michigan via a FFL who will perform the NICS to ensure that any prospective purchaser is legally authorized to purchase it; No exceptions whatsoever."

I wasnt planning to sell this but I have seen several of these sell online for well over $2k so I figured I would throw it up here to see if someone local was interested.  I am the third owner of this and I know the other two owners.  It is used but definitely not abused and is everything you would expect from a good quality rifle.

I may be interested in trades but I dont want your junk and the trade would have to benefit me.

Feel free to email me with your phone number and I will get back to you.  I do not want to respond to emails(I get enough spam) but I would be happy to call or text you just let me know what you would prefer.

The rifle has a total of 17 175gr smk's through it and thats it. The rifle has a Smith Enterprises ""Good Iron"" muzzle brake installed which greatly reduces the recoil,the rifle has a brand new never been shot with Bell and Carlson Medalist Tactical stock(Tan with black webbing), the stock has full aluminum bedding block free floats the barrel and is very comfortable. The rifle also has Talley rings with a Bushnell Elite 3200 10x40 fixed power scope installed as well, the scope is probably the best scope you can get for the money and is up to 50 cal rated(Scope model 32-1040M).Also included with the rifle is a Blackhawk 9""-12"" telescoping/swivel bipod that is also brand new. Rifle does come with the factory box,paperwork, and factory Hogue overmolded stock as well.

 The rifle has been painted a matte tan to match the stock and because the factory finish on the SPS series of rifles isnt that great and I wanted to protect it,I did miss a couple of spots near the rear of the receiver(see pics) if you dont like the paint it would easily come off or with the money you save on this rifle you could send it off and have it done professionally.
