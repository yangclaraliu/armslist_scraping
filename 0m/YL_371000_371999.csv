This is a good way to get into long range AR shooting.  If you have a more lightweight tactical upper, this is a good addition for those longer shots.

I'll make a list below of all the parts and their price from midwayusa.com so you can see that I'm not BS'ing you on the cost of parts. Some of the stuff isn't on Midway so I pulled the price from the manufacturers website. I encourage you to check yourself if you're skeptical. I figure if I don't get a good offer by the end of Wednesday, I'm just gonna keep it, put too much in it to get low balled. 

Parts:
Spike's Tactical stripped lower-$110 (Bought locally)  
Palmetto State Armory M4 profile upper w/BCG- $440
Palmetto State Armory lower parts kit- $50
Geissele SD-E two stage trigger- $235
BCM/Vltor Gunfighter charging handle Mod4 medium latch- $44
Troy Medieval flash hider- $45
Troy rear folding battlesight- $120
Primary Arms M3 red dot w/ cantilever mount- $80 (it's an AimPoint clone, but a solid scope nonetheless, definitely not airsoft grade)

Magpul items: 
UBR 6 position stock- $250
MOE+ pistol grip- $20
MOE handguards- $28
MOE trigger guard- $8
MOE foregrip- $23
MS2 2 point sling w/ troy quick detach swivel- $55
12x 30 round Pmags, 6 are black, and 6 are in FDE. 4 of the 12 are windowed- $168

Grand total of almost $1700. 6 of the magazines are fully loaded with brass cased ammo (not reloads), but it's not the best of the best, so I'm throwing it in for free. I realize that you can probably find a lot of the parts for a little bit less on different websites, but I consider that a fair estimate when you factor in shipping costs. 

As you can tell from the pics, all of the furniture is in FDE (so is the Troy back up sight). I'll also be including some of the original parts I took off/out of the rifle in case you want to switch them out, so there will be a stock A2 flash hider, GI trigger, A2 pistol grip, and m4 handguards. 

It's ridiculously fun to shoot, I just don't have anywhere to shoot it and ammo is getting too damn expensive. The trigger is amazing, and the second stage breaks like glass at about 1.5 lbs.

Asking $1200 firm for everything. Will not part it out. I will consider trades+cash. Mainly interested in handguns right now, especially full size 1911s and Smith & Wesson or Ruger revolvers. Not looking for shotguns or rifles at this time. 

Sorry about the wall of text, but if you read it all and are still interested, give me a call or text at 316-737-82 eight five. If you call you'll probably have to leave a message, but I'll get back to you asap. Thanks for looking."

The vz grips in the picture are not included but will come with the original grips.
The only mods done are two simple upgrades. Ed brown hardcore leaf spring and hard core extractor. The barrel bushing/cap has been polished silver. The barrel bushing is machined stainless so it will not rust easy. There is a very little bit of paint wear on the edge of the rail of the kimber. That is from me slipping the surefire x300 on. It was a really tight fit and the kimpro finish isnt as strong as other finishes.
The price is FIRM and I am taking no trades.
Anyways, if you are interested please text before you call REDACTED.
Please bring your CPL or ID. If you don't I will not sell the gun to you."

 The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

Now, you just found one for sale(because i'm not a serious collector.Ha,,Ha.LOL)
I rate the finish on the gun about 95% like new. Remember,this gun was make in 1999(13 years ago). Sitting around all time,didn't shoot much. Just put the Truglo night sight on recently ,which fiber optic and tritium inserted,this combination give you the same sight picture both daylight and night. This sight costs me $129(damn,sometimes i thought it made by gold,to expensive) I love this sight a lot,i have the original sights which came with the gun,too. Box,manual,2 recoil springs, 5 brand new grip washers (Sig's grips compatible) and 3 mags(Sig's mag isn't cheap,$45/each)

Just want to make it clear,nothing's wrong with this gun to force me selling it. All i want is pocket carry and the North American Arms NAA Guardian .32ACP is my "" Guardian "" right now. It will serve me as long as i'm still alive, until...i die or it's...stolen. Lol :-)

I posted the gun for sale once and i got a serious buyer, who wants to trade mine for his rare Ruger Mini14 stainless made a long time ago ( 1987 or ???) with $300 cash. He is one of nicest buyers who i've been contacted with, but...then, i decided not to trade because i love this gun so much, i can't live without it. And took the post off Armslist. Now, it's back. 

This is what i believe the best compact .45ACP ever made base on factors:  all metal made, fires .45ACP-firepower proven with little recoil (easy get back to target quickly after the 1st shot), compact grip for conceal carry but still feel comfortable in hand, accuracy, safe, reliability, durability, brand name, second strike option(DA/SA) if the primer is bad, easy to take down without tools to clean, ...I'm confident 100% to trust my life on this particular handgun. Don't believe me, bring the ammo, go to the range with me, i'll let you shoot it by all the positions you want. If the gun's malfunctioned by any kind, i'll give you $100.00 plus i'll pay you back the ammo. If it's eat anything and so accurate as tack-driver, no malfunctions occur, you lose your ammo and just give me $50.00 for my time.Ha...Ha Wanna gamble, guys...?????

This BB gun is a replica pistol based on the S&W Military and Police firearm. The M&P air pistol is a BB repeater powered by one 12g CO2 cylinder that hides in the grip of the BB pistol. An integrated accessory rail underneath the muzzle is a great place to add a tactical flashlight or an airgun laser. An element of realism is added with a 19-shot drop out BB magazine. The Smith & Wesson M&P CO2 pistol has a manual safety, double action trigger that's amazingly close to the actual handgun, and fixed front and rear fiber optic sights. This BB replica is not only a great BB gun for some fun plinking, but also makes a great target shooting and training pistol for S&W M&P firearm owners

Action/Receiver: All bolt components, receiver components, and trigger assembly MUST be in NEW or EXCELLENT condition. No rust, minimal abrasions, no damage.

Accessories: Optional, I don't really care. Prefer high magnification scope with wide objective lens. Also prefer a nice bipod. Offers with these accessories included will receive a higher payout.

-7 Mags
-Trijicon Night Sights (getting dim)
-Equinox Grips
-Custom professionally applied reverse two-tone Cerakote Finish.
(This entailed a complete break down of the pistol, and reassembly after finish applied. The controls were also Cerakoted to include the hammer, trigger, take down, barrel, and guide rod.) Pistol finished in a Flat Tan Dark Earth Frame with a Mil-Spec Black Cerakote slide.  Cerakote is currently the best firearms finish on the market today.  
-Frame stamped ""made in Germany"" slide stamed ""SigAmrs Inc. Exeter NH USA""
-This pistol just underwent an Ultrasonic cleaning.  Examined by a Sig Armor yearly where any and all worn parts were replaced.  
-SRT Trigger installed by Sigs Custom Shop in February of 2012.
-SigArms blue box

If you know your guns, this is one of the most reliable and sought after .45acp semi auto pistols.  Sig no longer makes the P220ST version.  The original P220ST is a stainless finish.  I did not like the flashy way it looked so it was sent off for the re-finish.  I am in absolutly no rush to sell this beauty, so any low ball offers will be ignored.  This pistol has seen little action the past few years.  It needs to find a new place to call home, not to mention that with its solid frame and slide, its getting heavy to wear daily.   No trades, cash only.

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

If you have another mini revolver (even if it is not in .22 magnum), I would consider it, but please don't be offended if I am not interested.  

I will also consider buying more than 1 if you have a few you would like to get rid of. 

I have cash in hand, concealed carry permit, and will sign a bill of sale.  

As far as price, I'm not looking for something for free, but please don't expect me to pay what I can walk into a store and buy these things for new.  It is not my intention to lowball anyone, I don't like it when it happens to me, so I won't do it to you.  

One final note: I travel to and from winston salem quite often, so if you are in route to winston, or in Winston, I would not mind stopping along the way.

The only reason I am selling this firearm to help pay for a trip to London, England this summer and i have other pistols in the .45 caliber. This is a Gen 3 Glock 21 with 2 month old night sights, arredondo extended factory magazines (17 rounds of .45 fun with these kits which also come with upgraded ""stiffer springs which equals to no FTF/FTE, Cost was 65$ for both kits) a third stock magazine, night sights that are only a few months old (100$, as well as a blind marked Lone Wolf stainless steel threaded barrel with black and stainless thread protectors (130$ for all). The gun has approximately 150 -200 rounds down the tube and functions flawlessly with both barrels, and yes the stock barrel, springs, case, etc are included. The gun is in like new condition with no slide wear. This is a solid piece of machinery that i really wish i didnt have to part with.

Once again CASH only, I am pretty firm on the price but i may budge a bit, and i am not interested in trades! If I cant sell i will just take out a personal loan for my trip.

I have too many guns in the safe.  I don't use this one.  It's time to go.

Franchi is Benelli.  It has Benelli's patented Inertia Driven system.  It runs like a find Swiss watch.  26"" barrel, 3"" chamber.

Comes with everything you see in the pics, extra chokes (never installed), manual, blank warranty card, mag plug.

The MSRP on these is over $900.  I'm selling this one LNIB with 100 rounds through it for under $600.
