Thank you very much."

It is a 12 Guage O/U shotgun with 28"" Barrels and Fixed Chokes (full and mod). Gun is in great condition, it has been shot very little but nonetheless used. It stays locked in my safe when its not being used.  ¾ down the barrels on the exterior, there are small light abrasions from fingerprints that were not wiped off years ago. There are a few small dings on the stock and fore grip that are consistent with normal handling. The lock lays slightly to the right as it should. With the Citori ""special steel"" barrels, this gun is safe to shoot steel shot even with the fixed chokes, however, none has been ran through it. The bores are bright and shiny.

This Citori model is stamped “J53” which should tell you what type it is but Browning failed to record this model during manufacturing. I’m not sure how many were stamped this way but there are a few blogs out there annotating the same misprint. This weapon opens, closes, ejects, and fires like a dream. I do not have the original box/papers but will include a case with it. Below of the specs:

And here we go... 

#10 - You can trade an old 44 for a new 22.

 #9 - You can keep one gun at home and have another for when you're on the road. 

#8 - If you admire a friend's gun and tell him so, he will probably let you try it out a few times.

 #7 - Your primary gun doesn't mind if you keep another gun for a backup.

 #6 - Your gun will stay with you even if you run out of ammo.

 #5 - A gun doesn't take up a lot of closet space. 

#4 - Guns function normally every day of the month.

 #3 - A gun doesn't ask , ""Do these new grips make me look fat?""

 #2 - A gun doesn't mind if you go to sleep after you use it.


And the Number One reason
 Why Men Prefer Guns over women.....


#1 - You can buy a silencer for a gun!"

They added the correct bushings and replace the piston when necessary so it will fire the lightest 2 ¾"" to the heaviest 3"" magnums.  Comes with 3 interchangeable chokes, choke tool, manual, original box, detachable carry handle, and detachable A post front sight including the below described custom shop parts and accessories.  These are extremely desirable for 3 gun, skeet shooting, home defense, and general shooting.  Functions flawlessly, NO FTF's. Awesome at shooting clays. I had a Burris Fast Fire III (not included) on my other MKA. I built 2 of these and decided to get rid of.  Love the gun but I want to build a new color combination version when these sell.  Everything DURABAKED received 2 coats, prepped, and baked correctly. Laser etched Tooth & Nail Armory Logos on the All Aluminum Forend.  Most of the aftermarket parts are either CNC machined, fabricated, and/or built in house by Tooth and Nail Armory and will qualify for 922 compliant parts since made in the USA. -TNA SIDE CHARGING Custom Forend with REMOVABLE rails –TNA replacement gas block drive system –TNA EXTENDED charging handle  -Magpul MBUS Front and rear sights will be included. -TNA Pistol grip adapter to accept and for changing M4 Grips -ERGO Grip -TNA All Aluminum Stock adapter to accept & interchange M4 stocks  -Ergo f93 9 position adjustable stock and buffer tube –Single point sling mount –Ergo black recoil pad –TNA Full trigger assembly with disconnector, hammer, and power spring  -I'll include either a Magpul AFG forend grip or a Magpul MOE vertical grip (your choice)   The magazines were striped of factory finish, tumbled in aggregates to remove remaining paint, durabaked and baked twice then reassembled.  The interior as well was painted for faster shooting and feeding.  The feed ramp, trigger, and few other parts were polished by a professional gunsmith for smoother operation and is just part of what goes into their builds as well as the Barrel Chamfered for better feeding and reliability. Lastly If you have other questions please just email and ask.   Must be 18 yrs of age to purchase.  Ships to FFL.  No shipping to CA or other states illegal to own.  Its buyer's responsibility to know local laws. Credit Card, Money order or certified cashier's check please.  No scams

Has been ""sporterized"" at some point in the last 90 years with a new stock.  Stock is missing butt plate, but I figured I would leave replacment up to the restorer.  All stampings look correct from what I know about these guys.  Chambered in .303 Brit.  Has all sight pieces on it. Magazine is aftermarket like most of these (10 round detatchable magazine).  25"" barrel approx.  Flip-up adjustable elevation sight with markings from 200 - 1400 yards.  

This is a very cool vintage Enfield.  Only about 20,000 of these were ever produced.  I have never fired this gun, but all actions work and rifling looks good.  I assume it could be fired as-is with no issues, but the buyer will take the responsibilty of verifying its safe function.  Bolt cycles, pin fires, safey works, mag goes in/out, rounds will feed through.  

Sold as-is with no ammo.  Many more pictures available (email me for a link).  Can be seen in person M-F 6am-5pm near US-131 & M-6 on the south side of Grand Rapids. 

Asking $250 obo (with case).  $225 obo without case."

This is a pre-ban model that was made in 1986.  This gun has threaded barrel tip which is hard to find.  It also has the Romanian Military bayonet and a side mount scope (which is not on the gun but installs in less than a minute) and a cheap tasco red dot that is on the mount. It also has the cleaning kit that came with the gun and a strap.

This gun has been used and tested for years, it is clean, oiled and ready to go. The action on this gun is not nearly as smooth as my Mak 90 or SLR AK variants but, like all AK's, this thing will fire without a problem no matter what you feed it.  It has been used to take down 2 deer as well so it is fairly accurate (as far as AK accuracy goes)

This gun will come with 2 - 30 round magazines loaded with ammo.

If you are looking for a cheap, reliable gun that is priced hundreds below what other people are selling on here. This is it. 

$875 or best reasonable offer. If I do not respond it means I was not interested in your offer.

I am also not interested in trades, I am trying to downsize my gun collection.  I also will not ship this gun.  Local cash sale only.

Two Ruger 10/22s. The green stock is not for sale. They are both unfired new in-box with all paperwork and miscellaneous items (lock and manual and scope rail). The first is a pink laminated and the second was a zombie green but that stock is spoken for so I have changed the stock to a standard carbine stock that I got from a friend(I bet most of you have your own stock anyway). The pictures have a dark area in the center because of the lighting I used. The Pink laminated is $430 and the standard carbine is $380. I will take $370 on the standard carbine if you do not want the stock at all. 

I repeat the green stock is not for sale but shown for reference only. This will be a bill of sale type sale ie you will supply your name and drivers license number and I will supply mine and we will both sign. Leave your phone number if you are serious. I will reply email also and if sold. If the ad is still up I still have a gun for sale.

This AR-Stoner AR-15 Bolt Carrier Group includes a complete 223 Remington / 5.56x45mm NATO bolt assembly, mil-spec (M16-type) bolt carrier, firing pin, cam pin, and properly staked gas key. The high quality bolt carrier is precision machined from ordnance-grade 4130 chrome moly steel, while the bolt is constructed of high strength 8620 steel. With the exception of the stainless steel firing pin, the entire bolt carrier assembly features a matte black manganese phosphate coating for superior corrosion resistance and durability. The supply of these AR-15 bolt carrier groups is very limited, so make sure to pick one up for your next rifle build or for use as a spare before it's too late!"

I have two Ruger 10/22s. The green stock is not for sale. They are both unfired new in-box with all paperwork and miscellaneous items (lock and manual and scope rail). The first is a pink laminated and the second was a zombie green but that stock is spoken for so I have changed the stock to a standard carbine stock that I got from a friend(I bet most of you have your own stock anyway). The pictures have a dark area in the center because of the lighting I used. The Pink laminated is $430 and the standard carbine is $380. I will take $370 on the standard carbine if you do not want the stock at all. 

I repeat the green stock is not for sale but shown for reference only.

I've never had any issues with it, fires real clean (although that may depend on the ammo you use). Takes me maybe 10 minutes tops to clean it out after a trip to the gun range. The barrel finish is a little worn in a strip along the top right side of the barrel towards the muzzle. I usually spread some oil over all the exposed metal parts and wipe it down, so no rust problems. Comes with a free sling and bag.

Also the scope is an older Leupold Vari-X IIc, but it has almost all the same specs as current VX-2 models, so I'm listing it as a VX-2. Great scope. I bought two more Leupolds for other rifles because I liked this one so much."

The .22lr just couldn't reach out far enough.  After A few months of getting shot at they got smart enough to not land there any more.  So, this beautiful rifle became a dust collector, and that's not to fair to it.  Figured I would see if anyone on here was interested.  Has a 3-9X40 scope (if I remember right they use Bushnell scopes for this package).  Great shooter, has killed more then 1 crow at 200 yards.  Cash only and we will meet at a dealer so you can get it transferred to your name.  Hope to find her a good home.
