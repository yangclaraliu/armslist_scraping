This was for my wife who I thought would like it for it's DA/SA, decocker, and safety. She now prefers a striker fired gun without safeties or SA (and I'm sure it'll take another gun or two before she decides). We've put about a box or two through it (less than 100 rounds) without issues. I've had other Berettas and their quality, customer service (if needed), fit and finish and reliability is outstanding...this PX4 SC is no exception. It's light weight, very easy to control and get off quick follow up shots. The DA trigger pull is a smooth and crisp 7lbs giving some peace of mind when carrying. The SA pull is probably about 4lbs, maybe a pinch less. The decocker is a nice bonus. Included is a never worn factory Beretta pancake holster made for and embossed with the PX4 Storm logo on it...still needs breaking in.

I paid $500 for the gun and another $50 for the holster. I'm asking $475 for it all and I'll throw in 50 hydrashok (180grain) rounds and ONE full mag of my good stuff (180 grain black talons). There's no real wear, scuffs, or marks (not even smileys on the barrel). This gun is ""as new"" as you can get shy of being NIB.

Stoeger Industries is a subsidiary of Beretta. The Stoeger Cougars are made in Turkey using the same machinery that Beretta used to make the original Cougars. It is every bit the quality of the Beretta. The Stoeger 8000 in 9mm is identical to the Beretta Cougar L Type P (Cougar L slide, lighter barrel and beveled slide, but with a full-length magazine).
It’s an ergonomically advanced pistol, compact but capable of handling high-power cartridges as the 9 mm Parabellum, with great fire capacity and extraordinary long life.  This has been possible also thanks to a brilliant adaptation of a proven locked breech system with a Unique Rotating Barrel.  By channeling part of the recoil energy into barrel rotation, and by partially absorbing the barrel and slide recoil shock through the central block before it is transferred to the frame, the cougar achieves unusually low felt recoil.

It is a gun I would trust my life with and enjoy shooting.  I have carried the 8045 version for years and it’s an excellent CCW, next to the 1911 I carry now.  You’ll not fine a better 9mm.  Comes with Case, Books, Locks and 4 Mags.

I never gave these rifles much attention until I got one and I was really impressed with it after I shot it. I thought the trigger was going to be bad but I was really impressed with the factory trigger on it. It shot very well and the accuracy with factory loads was impressive. Even with the cheaper .223 ammo it shot better than my Remington 700 did with factory loads. The scope has been sighted in and the barrel was broken in properly. This rifle is ready to blast groundhogs if we ever get any good weather. I am also including 50 rounds of Ultramax .223 ammo which is lake city brass loaded with 55gr Hornady v-max bullets. For $280 you can have a nice little ground hog gun that is ready to go. Even for the retail MSRP this is still a lot of rifle for the money.

Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few.

This rifle has been shot very little, and only shows wear on the finish directly behind the ejection port (ask any 556 owner and they will tell you this is unavoidable) see pics for details.

In addition to the rifle, I'm going to throw in a Sig-Sauer rifle case, a set of attachable Picatinny rails, and 4 PMAGs.  The Magazines alone are worth $80, so I feel the package to be a fair deal. FTF is viable for PA residents, would prefer to transfer through local FFL, and I'd even split the cost with you.
I would be willing to throw in a case(400 rounds) of Federal XM193CBP 5.56 55 gr. FMJ for another $150. This stuff is great ammo.

Right off the bat, I'll tell you that you can go on to Wicked Laser's website right now and order this very laser for $299.99. However, I won't take anything close to that. The FDA (yes FDA) has put an import ban on any handheld laser above 5mw. This particular laser is 200x more powerful then what current import allows. Actually getting your hands on one of these is VERY diffcult. I'm a GM for UPS and even with my connections in customs, it still took me 6 1/2 months to get a hold of mine. From what I'm told 85% of these are seized.

  However, once you DO have one, they are pretty incredible. It will burn or melt most things dark colored. You can cut through plastics, light cigs, pop ballons, start fires, etc. The beam is so powerful that if you pointed it straight up in the air, no only can you see the beam the entire way up, but the only reason it doesn't hit outter space is because our inner atmosphere diffuses the beam. If you were at sea, and pointed the beam straight out infront of you, the only reason you aren't able to see it past a certain point is because of the curvature of the Earth.

318,http://www.armslist.com/posts/132318,For Sale:  EcoQuest FreshAir Surrounds Purifier (NIB),"Spring, Houston, Texas",$ 550,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 4, 2011",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"First, to clarify my position.   I am an independent Sr.  Automation Engineer/Consultant ( Ball EcoSystems), which uses Vollara as one of my distributors for products.   Additionally, before I market or recommend any product from them, I have bought one to use, evaluate in my home, and validate any claims and buy using the product myself, to know if it is worth marketing or referring.   The products I’m listing for Sale or Trade --- I own, use, and believe in.

I am also a Gun Trader/Collector, so these are offered at a reduced cost or for trade towards certain guns.   Let me know what you have and I will consider and say ‘Yes’ or ‘Thank you, but Not at this time.’ I prefer 1911’s or AR’s in 6.5 Grendel, 6.8 or .308.   If trading, I will allow the sale value of the unit to go towards the Trade.

Here I am offering a EcoQuest Fresh Air Purifier, which actually purifies the air (Not just Filters it) with NASA Technology.   I have had a commercial Electric Electrostatic unit installed in my Central Unit (which has failed after 7 years) and this unit has equaled the results at about 1/5 th the cost (It would cost me $2500+ to replace the central filter). 

This is the major advantage of the EcoQuest -- since it doesn't rely on bringing air into the unit in order to clean and purify the air, you can position it to cover a large part (up to 3000 sqft) of a house.

Selling for $575 (Retail $750) will trade for $550 Value.

Enfield No. 1 Mk III
This GRI marked rifle is in excellent shape and is NOT import marked and is all matching.  It is an Ishapore made rifle that has not been molested or used extensively like most Ishapores on the market today.  This rifle has an excellent bore that is bright and shiny with strong lands and grooves.  Everything functions great. The action is tight and works perfectly. It even has the black plastic oiler in the buttstock.
This rifle comes with an original 1907 Pattern blade bayonet that is in excellent condition. It was made by Wilkinson and appears to be in very good condition.  The sheath is in excellent shape too with good tight stitching in the leather and NO separation. The original canvas frog is included as well and is in perfect condition.
I am asking $350.00 for this rifle and bayonet.


Enfield No. 4 Mk II
This rifle is in great shape.  The bore is excellent, bright and shiny with good rifling.  The action works perfect.  The wood is in great shape with no cracks gouges or damage of any kind.  This rifle would make an excellent shooter. It is very hard to find a No4 Mk II in this condition.  This rifle is in very good shape both inside and out. It even comes with the original canvas sling.
I am asking $275.00 for this rifle.

Spanish Oviedo carbine
This carbine is in great shape. However, it has been sportarized by someone cutting the stock down and removing the sights.  It has also been drilled and tapped for a scope. It has German WWII markings, but they don't look to be original.  I'll leave that up to the buyer.  There are NO import markings on the rifle.  The bore is dark, but has strong lands and grooves.
I am asking $100.00 for this rifle.

Yugo M24/47
This rifle is in excellent shape with a great bore.  It functions perfectly and shoots great.  It is all numbers matching and is import marked on the receiver.  The wood is in good condition with no cracks or damage.  It comes complete with front sight hood, cleaning rod and original sling.  It also comes with a very nice Yugo bayonet that is in great shape.
I am asking $250.00 for this rifle and bayo"

 This is the two tone Bersa Thunder 380 in the original box with the paperwork and both keys for the built in lock,trigger lock and a Fobus Holster and a soft carrying case.I actually like this gun much more than my ruger LCP but I decided to keep the LCP and sell this one only because the LCP is a little smaller and easier to hide when on a motorcycle.
 I'm looking to purchase a Taurus Judge or tactical type shotgun for home protection...but also interested in possably a larger caliber handgun not as a carry gun but more a nightstand gun. So if you have any of the above and are looking for a nice concealed carry gun let me know and lets see if we can work out a deal that makes us both happy.I have some cash to make up the difference if you have a Judge.

Here is what I know about the shotgun. Rabbit ear, tight. Barrel says Laminated Steel on top..J.B. Clement was a large sporting goods dealer, probably from the Cincinnati, Ohio region. From the 1880s to 1908 Clement operated in partnership with a Cincinnati gun maker, P. Powell and operated as Powell and Clement. Clement also imported several designs of guns from England and Belgium which varied greatly in quality and price. Charles Carder's ""Side by Sides of the World"" is the source of this information. Got this info off the net. Best I can tell this gun made late 1800's from Belgium. Can't guarantee but my best guess.

I really do not want to part my Eotech but depending on the right trade offer, I may trade it. 

I had this Eotech for only two months, bought it brand new so its still in mint condition. 

It is mounted on my AR-15 and had only shot 200 rounds with the Eotech mounted on my rifle.

I paid $489 + tax for the sight, which comes out to $535. The MSRP is $519 so I think my prices are fair. 

Sale prie is $500 cash.
Trade price is $525.

Trade I am interested in is a Remington Model 700 Bolt Action Rifle in 223 or 308 with black furniture or other bolt action rifles.

So total asking is 195.00 with sling and ammo. Thanks for looking.

And a new, repositioned string stop that opens up the sight window and halts vibration.

3 PMAGs... one foliage green, 2 FDE 30rounders.  Two of them have the ranger pull tabs on them ($14 each)
6 HK Ar 15 mags used but in decent shape. ($10 each at recent gun shows)
600rds of 62gr M855 green tip, steel core penetrators.($150)


All said and done it's worth about $1350.... I'll take $1000.  

Round count on the rifle is probably 500rds.  I bought this one a month before I bought my LMT... subsequently this one was a safe queen.  

FTF only... will be driving through Denver Saturday....

Up for sale is a Remington 700 ADL in .308 Winchester.  This gun is approximately 20 years old.  When I look inside the stock the year 1991 is stamped there.  This is probably a good indication of year of manf.  I have properly tuned the trigger down to b/w 3.0-3.5 lbs.  I am a Remington factory authorized armorer so I actually know how to do this without sacrificing the safety aspect of the firearm.  The blueing is in very good shape as well as the walnut stock.  The rifle has iron sights and at one time had a scope mounted on it.  All filler screws are present where the scope mount was so there are no unsightly holes present in the top of the receiver.
