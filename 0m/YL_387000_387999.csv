I am selling this due to a trip that I am going on and actually leaving tomorrow. I need the extra cash. I bought this brand new back in February and have not even had a chance to get it to the range yet...round count is zero. I had night sights installed and then stored it in the safe. It will come with everything that it came with new. Factory hardside carry case, 10 rd mag, 17 rd mag, paperwork, speedloader and the original factory sights that were taken off of it. The night sights are not the glow in the dark kind that need to exposed to light for them to glow. These actually emit there own light 24/7 for a period of 12-15 years. The night sights are currently 2 months old with a long life ahead of them.

I’ve put about 100 flawless rounds through this pistol, the barrel is bright and the weapon is clean.  Taurus has a lifetime warranty (not that you'd need it)."

The fully adjustable set trigger works by having a normal trigger pull in not set mode, and a very light trigger pull in the set mode. When you're ready to take a shot, push the trigger forward into set mode, any additional pressure on the trigger backwards will allow accurate firing. Roughly about 1lb pull in set mode and 4lb in normal / not set mode.

This gun is new and only factory fired. I bought it originally for a conversion to 300 Whisper / 300blk which only requires a barrel change and a magazine modification. However, I don't have the time right now to even outsource that project. I'll revisit that idea at another time.

I have replaced the wood stock that comes on the American. This stock is the more expensive kevlar/fiberglass that comes standard on the 527 Varmint. This gun as is has all the benefits of the nicer stock without the by noticeable extra weight the varmint version has because of the much heavier barrel. This stock is $240 alone. The standard barrel has plenty of room to float in the larger channel, doesn't look all that bad.

I also have CZ factory rings included. Includes original factory removable magazine (5 shot). CZ-527 is based on the 1898 Mauseqr action, fully controlled feed and eject (flawless every time). 

This would make an excellent gun for a youth, varmint shooter that still wanted to be able to move around (farmer?), practical shooter, anyone looking to make a 300 Whisper / 300blk rifle (use the varmint contour at 16""), etc.

Wife says:  It is a rifle. Not that big. Black and greenish. It is, unfortunately, a bolt action.  That is about it. Has a trigger. And a barrel. Pretty light. And other stuff. I think that is all.

I just don't use this shotgun and need space in the safe! I am asking $250, or $220 cash and some ammo to make up the difference. I need 40,45,7.62x39, and 7.62x54R.

This upper is less than one year old and I have used this upper only once and then only with a .22LR CMMG conversion bolt for about 200 rounds. I did fire 3 rounds of .223 Ammo to clean the gas tube out before field stripping the upper and properly cleaning and oiling it for storage. So the .556 BCG with the factory test firing probably has less than 10 rounds on it. The upper itself has everything as purchased except I have added the NC Star gas block mounted front Flip up site."

In 1932, the company, headed by Carl Gustav Swebilius, purchased the Hartford Arms and Equipment Company and began making .22 caliber pistols.
In 1952, Sgt. Joe Benner, U.S.  Army,  won the Gold Medal in the Olympic Rapid Fire competition using a High Standard pistol. Then again in 1960, Colonel William McMillan, U.S. Marines, won the Gold Medal in the Olympic Rapid Fire competition using a High Standard pistol.

Model 6280
Level II Retention Duty Holster, Mid-Ride

The Safariland Model 6280 holster is the base model of Self Locking System (SLS) series of holsters. It includes a unique rotating hood design. This holster also features a Universal Belt Loop that mounts on a 2"" or 2.25"" Duty Belt. With no snap, the Safariland 6280 holster's SLS design allows for a smoother single-motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways. The hood can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. It is also far less likely to release accidentally than conventional thumb break snaps. The 6280 holster features a tensioning device, which, when firmly adjusted becomes a Level III Retention holster.

I have the title in hand.
I have a new battery for it.
I have new turn signals for it because the guy that owned it before me damaged them and just taped them back.
It was dropped by the previous owner, I never got the chance to do it myself, so there is some paint damage on the left side on the tail.
It is a dark red color.
It has LESS THAN 7000 miles on it. I don't know the exact amount at the moment but I will update this when I get the chance. I will be able to send pictures by thursday this week.

It has a Valdada Pitbull 1-4x optic mounted to it with a 50-200 zero. This scope is a tank, and that is the only drawback. The glass is great, it has held its zero, its got a huge FOV and plenty of eye relief. I set it at 4 on the long range stages and turn it to 1 up close, I never really saw the need for anything in between. I have yet to hear anyone that has actually used this scope say anything bad about it and there's a few around here that have them.

There is approximatly 300 rounds through this gun, probably less.

Is a like new Custom hand built & assembled from the ground up, Rock River Heavy 16"" Barreled ( M.S.C.A.R ) Mini Sniper Carbine AR15 Rifle, It was all hand ( built, fitted, & assembled ) from the ground up, With all hand picked milspec. Rock River parts, Making for a more solid tighter tolerance built rifle, That is very solid feeling and very accurate, I has only had a couple magazine ever ran thru it since it was built new...


It has a milspec. airgaged Match grade machine gun rated chrome lined heavy bull barrel that is a full 1"" inch diameter under the hand guards with a 1-9 twist from dti, The barrel also has a Match grade front sight gas block post with an adjustable square Match grade front sight pin & working bayonet lug, Next it has a current military style second generation milspec. Birdcage flashider, That is closed in on the bottom to keep muzzle rise down while also keeping the rifle from kicking up a dust signature when shooting from a prone position, 


The barrel has also had a full Lapping & Flowing job done on the bore, For a more consitant bullet to rifling contact down the length of the bore, Also it had a chamber polishing and bolt locking lug mating jobe done on it as well, For better feeding and ejecting of ammo and spent cartridges with a solid quicker lockup into battery position, 


Then it has a milspec. Forged wt/numbered T-marked M4 ROCK RIVER picatini flattop upper receiver, That has the more reliable M4 feedramps cut in it for better more reliable feeding of ammo into the chamber, It was mated up to a hand picked milspec. Forged LAR marked ROCK RIVER lower receiver for a close tight tolerance fit and feel between them, Making for a very solid firm feeling shooting platform with very little movement between them, 


Next it had a hand fitted and diamond stone polished single stage trigger assembly job done, With vertually no felt backlash with only an eight of an inch travel to the trigger break, Built from all hand picked and polished milspec. Rock River parts, Making for a very smooth consistant trigger action,


Then it had a milspec. original shorter style 4 position collapsible buttstock and buffer tube assembly installed on it, Making for a more compactable collapsible rifle that is easier to handle, It also had a Match grade buffer and spring assembly installed in it for less felt recoil transfered to the shooters shoulder, 


This is one sweet solid and very accurate tack driving rifle that I really really hate to get rid of, Especially before I get a chance to really accessorise and deck it out with some quad rail hand guards a nice harness style tactical sling and some nice optics, ((( NOTE ))) the Harris Swivling Bi-pods in the pictures are ((( NOT ))) included, As they belong to my daughter and goes on her rifle, I just used them to hold up this rifle to take pictures of it, 


I have almost two grand in having this piece custom hand built for me from the ground up, With the cost of all of the ( Milspec. Parts, Barrel & custom barrel lapping job, The hand fitted Diamond stone polished trigger assembly job, and Gunsmithing labor cost ), But due to needed home repairs I am listing this baby up for sale for $1350 or best offer...

Emails from Lowballers will be ignored, So please serious buyers only, Be curtious and don't waste mine or your time with lowball offers, If you want a nice piece of hardware here is your chance to get something that is very well built..."

This has the original Hungarian chrome lined barrel and Hungarian receiver. It has a spot 
welded muzzle brake/barrel extension. This rifle is basically new. I am the 
original owner and shot less than 100 rounds through it. It comes with the 
box, cleaning kit still in package, and Tapco 20 round magazine. 

I changed out the grip to a Tapco SAW type grip and added a Midwest 
Industries AK rail for the purpose of 922r compliance, but I still have the 
original parts and it's an easy swap. 

This gun doesn't have any cant in the sight or gas block that and has never had a FTF or FTE. It shoots well with little muzzle rise (the brake works really well) and is surprisingly accurate. The folding stock is tight. There are a few scratches where the stock folds up on the back of the rear trunnion, but otherwise no scratches. Basically it's new. 

I would like to trade it all as a package for a high quality 9mm of the same value or 1911 in .45 acp (can give boot in the form of mags, ammo or cash,for a good 1911). Prefer Commander or Gov't size. As for rifles, I would trade even for Century vz. 58 will give boot for Czechpoint vz. 58.

I have a nice Ruger Mini 30 for sale or trade. It was manufactured between 1990 and 91. It is all original with the wood stock and a nice tiger stripe camo Simmons scope installed with Ruger scope mounts. It is a 3-9x40 variable power scope.  The Ruger scope mounts allow the scope to be attached and removed without losing your zero. The rifle itself has adjustable flip up rear iron sights as well. It also comes with 15 magazines, nine 30 round mags, five 15 rds and a stock Ruger 5 round mag and an adjustable three point tactical sling.
I will sell for $725 cash or trade for a little more.  If you have some other nice tactical type rifle, make me an offer.  I'm not really interested in hunting rifles.
Please follow the link below to photobucket for pics.
Thanks and please let me know what you have to trade or if you have any questions.

Rifle is a Smith and Wesson M&P 15 in 223 / 556, it has a forward assist   and detachable carry handle ( this is not the lower end M&P 15 ""Sport"" that dosnt  have a forward assist).  It comes with a railed section attatched to the handguard along with a authentic Grip-pod  ( spingloaded bi-pod colapses into the handle) shown in the picture.

Google search Guns and Ammo's M&P 15 review, all 4 test rifles went 4500 rounds without any malfunctions.

*Why pay more for a new AR that may have bugs that need to be worked out?* 

This rifle has had about 300 rounds of different weights and styles and has NEVER malfunctioned.  It has functioned perfectly with 15 year old USGI magazines (it will come with the original PMAG), only brass cased ammunition has been used.  This gun has never done anything I didn't expect it to do, it feeds/extracts/shoots with absolute perfection.

The rifle has been used but not abused.  This is my work gun so it has a few light scratches on the buffer tube from being put in and taken out of the patrol car. Its never been fired without lube and has been cleaned after each shooting session."

The finish started to wear the first time it was fired. You can check the gun forums as this is common.

Gun has about 500 rounds through it. Only one FTF, due to hard primer in ammo. Otherwise the gun has performed flawlessly. Selling because I don't need it and am not used to a SA gun. I have confidently carried in my front pocket with no concern of AD, but I am not confident in remembering to take the safety off in SD situation.

Gun sells for $525-550 new, with laser. The holsters are worth about $120 new. Extra mag is about $40 new. So this is about $100 less than retail for everything (not including some SD ammo I will throw in). Open to reasonable offers.

Brief History: Spain was in the process of implementing the CETME assault rifle, however there were not enough CETME's to issue for training. Using stockpiles of older Mauser bolt action rifles (1916 & 1943 models) they developed a rifle that would fill the gap for training purposes until more CETME rifles were produced. The Spanish Special Purpose FR7 & FR8 rifles were born.

This is a light fast handling rifle with minimal recoil. A scout rifle before the scout concept was even thought of.

It has a chrome lined barrel, magpul pistol grip, 6 point adj stock and 5 30 rd mags (4 pmags and 1 gi mag). It's marketed as a ""milspec"" rifle, whatever that means. I've had a few months and just haven't gotten around to shooting it. It's just lived in a case in the closet.

-9mm handguns, specifically a Ruger SR9c, Gen 3 Glock 17, Kahr PM9. I might be interested in other 9mms, but those 3 models are really what I'm looking for.

-Kel Tec Sub 2000 9mm in a Glock configuration
