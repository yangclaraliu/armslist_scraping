This was an optics ready version, so I've added the front and rear folding iron sights for a clear view with the new Eotech 512 GG&G package (comes with GG&G front/rear lens covers and their patented quick detach mounting system that guarantees 0.5 MOA return. I picked out the correct sights so the Eotech and iron sights will co-witness if wanted. Comes with Hogue Grip Kit that includes a sealed compartment to store extra batteries/coins for optics/attachments. Has Magpul aluminum trigger guard, MOE handguard w/ MOE picatinny rail mounted at bottom. Standard vertical foregrip and flashlight holder. Includes custom trigger kit from brand new components for an exact crisp 3lb. pull. Factory trigger kit is included. Will include 260 rounds of Federal XM193 5.56 NATO in boxes. Then I have the two original 30rd aluminum mags, and then 3 Magpul 30rd. PMAGS full with XM193 for a total of 5 mags and 350 rounds of XM193 ammo. 

Only around 400 rounds of XM193 through it since new. Barrel was broke in correctly and I'd bet it will shoot sub MOA. Not a scratch on the gun whatsoever. Never handled by anyone but me. Comes with case and every box from all aftermarket items including all manuals, etc.

You won't find a nicer AR-15 with the money in it I have even close to this price. You really must see it to appreciate how clean it is. I don't price gouge due to the current circumstances. What I want is fair and I expect many interested. You can offer higher and that will get you a priority response. I'd like to get this sold by the weekend. Serious buyers with cash only! Please reply with a number I can reach you at."

Up for sale is a Norinco SKS with functioning bayonet in excellent condition.  Uses the exact same ammo as the more popular AK-47. I have only put about 100-150 rounds through this at most, so it's very lightly used and it shoots great. I put the Tapco collapsible stock on it with a top rail because I intended to add optics but never got around to it.

So here are the particulars of what you are getting;

- excellent condition SKS 7.62 x 39 rifle
- factory spring loaded bayonet
- Tapco tactical stock with 4 position collapsible stock
- SAW style pistol grip
- top rail for mounting a scope or other optics
- 5 - 20 round magazine (3 black, 2 tan)

Asking $650 OBO Cash

Only possible trades considered;

- Springfield XDm in 9mm. Compact (3.8"") or competition (5.25"")
- Springfield XDm in .45 full size (4.5"") or competition (5.25"")
- something that would knock my socks off

I understand these ""assault"" rifles could be going away in the future and that prices are severely inflated right now. Regardless, I do know how much AR-10's and M1A's typically sell for either new or used. I do not plan on buying or selling either/or for outrageous prices, but I do base the selling price of the AR-10 on less than what I've invested because it is a used gun and not what they are selling for at gun stores these days.

FROM THE MANUFACTURER: The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle. The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots. 

Overall length of the barrel is 16"" (14.7"" barrel with pinned/welded muzzle device) so it is not a Class 3 NFA item.  LWRC or any competent armorer can switch out to a different muzzle device.

I bought a heavy barrel, stock and magazine package with an amazing camo print. Its not a camo sticker. Since the firearm started off as a pistol it is legal to convert and revert it to a rifle AS LONG AS YOU DONT PUT THE PISTOL BARREL ON THE RIFLE STOCK. Its got a red dot sight on it, a good bipod, a carrying case for the pistol parts, and a ton of ammo. Its around 3000 rounds. I know its expensive, but this stuff cost a lot at normal retail price.   900 for everything, and I will consider trades.

Altogether, they admitted to having over 25,000 (TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND) AR units by various manufacturers in stock, but they're only releasing a few a week to keep driving prices up. Ammo? Several have multiple tractor trailer loads of .223/5.56 and 7.62x39 in storage, but it's being dribbled into the market as prices and demand rise. They told me the distributors and manufacturers are also playing games. A prominent AR manufacturer I've known for over thirty years told me he has no room left in which to store finished products, but he refused to say how many units he's withholding from the market while he waits for prices to go up. His warehouse is massive, I've been inside it. He's undoubtedly holding back at least 50,000 finished and packaged units. Those ""scarce"" weapons are not scarce, they're plentiful. It's all about $$$$$. Even if a new law is passed, it probably won't take effect until next January. Wise people who wanted certain rifles bought them before 1994 or after 2004. Beware. The AR/AK market has obviously (once again) become a sucker's game and it will collapse.....Politicians on BOTH SIDES are playing on the emotions of the simple minded in order to attempt to disarm the public at large so they can safely finish implementing their long awaited dictatorship. They're fools, most of us will neither give up nor give in. ""Gun control"" ALWAYS precedes genocide. Search and read ""JPFO Genocide Chart."" From personal experience, I have NO faith in NRA, I belong to JPFO. NRA absolutely refused to try to stop the 1986 machine gun law saying ""We don't support the manufacture or civilian ownership of fully automatic weapons OR sound moderators"" - Strange how they've very recently radically altered their stance on the latter! According to BATF&E, not ONE legally owned fully automatic weapon has EVER been used to commit a crime! For 2011, FBI official homicide statistics show that rifles were used in 323 homicides, while 496 were committed with blunt objects (clubs, hammers, etc.), and 728 were committed with personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.). Overall, 323 homicides is an insignificant number, which proves that the true objective of all the current highly emotional and false propaganda about how ""dangerous"" certain rifles are is crystal clear. FBI overlooks how much the politicians in D.C. are stealing from us every year and how they're working night and day to destroy the U.S. Constitution. The oath of office has become meaningless! Corrupt, self-serving politicians and other governmental employees, not firearms, are the problem. Congress has an approval rating of 10% to 15%. You are not alone, EVERYONE (except the parasites) is fed up. The switchboard at the U.S. Capitol can be reached @ REDACTED, it's open 24/7/365. A very polite live operator will direct your call to the office of your representative. Representatives are NOT royalty, they are OUR EMPLOYEES and they need to be reminded of that fact. Write it down, keep it handy, call and let your employee know what you want him to do (they're not mind readers). REDACTED. GOD BLESS AMERICA! ........................................................................................................................“We can evade reality, but we cannot evade the consequences of evading reality”  - AYN RAND."

Its an honest shooter and in great condition, no rust on any metal that I can see! Took it to the range recently and ran ~ 48 rounds through it with 8 bangs and a ping each time! I had it at 50yds and had no trouble at all hitting a 4"" gong repeatedly firing off-hand. I didn't get a chance to run it over to the 100yd line...but I suspect it'd be pretty darn tight grouping.

Iron sight have been replaced with Meprolight Tru-Dot night sights. Hand guard replaced with UTG quad. NcSTAR tactical green laser, quick release tactical light, foregrip/popout bipod and rail covers included. Side plat installed for scope mount. Comes with UTG quick release scope mount and UTAC 2.5-10x40 red/green illuminated sniper scope. M-4 style adjustable buttstock with saddle (has battery storage), rubber recoil buttpad, Mako ergonomic pistol grip (also has battery storage) and three point sling. Magazine quick release, two Tapco 30 rd mags, pair of mag clamps and 60 Hornady Zombie Max rounds (great for personal defense). Trigger group replaced with Tapco G2 trigger group. Recoil buffer added to internals. Safety has notches cut into it to hold open bolt. One is for if a recoil buffer is installed and the other is for without. All parts added or replaced, with the exception of the bolt, were made in the USA. This firearm is 922r compliant. This is the ultimate tactical weapon. It can easily empty a 30 round mag in 15 seconds at 100 yards and get a 6 inch grouping. This is a very accurate AK. This is due to the multiple features that reduce recoil giving you better target reacquisition. This firearm has been well taken care of. I have put a few thousand rounds through it and it seems to get better with age. it has been thoroughly cleaned (not that an AK needs it) and has no rust in or out. The only downside to this gun is that it's a little heavy with all the extras attached (about 10lbs. empty) so it's not for sissies. Price is firm but I MAY be open to trading for a pistol caliber rifle (UMP, MP5, CX4 etc.) Cash preferred. Serious buyers only. More pics available upon request. Call or text REDACTED.

I have Slide Fire SSAK stock installed on a Romanian WASR 10/63. Great fun to shoot semi, full auto, and very controllable for burst fire. Guaranteed to make every head turn at the range. The rifle comes with a tactical bag, four 30 round mags, a bayonet, a Tapco G2 trigger installed, and bolt buffer installed. This rifle is completely legal to own and is really the only option that most of us will ever have for a rapid fire firearm. I am quite sure that the first thing Obama goes after will be the slidefire stocks so if you don't get this one now you might not ever be able to. This rifle is very lightweight for an AK and shoots great.

*** There has been some confusion with my listing so I will try to clear it up. This rifle is not an ""illegal"" full auto AK. It uses a slide fire stock to simulate automatic fire. You can turn the auto/burst fire on and off with a turn of a knob on the bottom of the stock. No special licenses are needed to own this weapon. When you buy this rifle I will give you a card with a copy of info from the ATF that states the rifle is legal. ***

SPECIAL ALERT UPDATE– YOUR ACTION REQUIRED SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES BILLS TO RUN RANGES OUT OF BUSINESS AND BAN 80% OF YOUR GUNS

MESSAGE FROM COMMITTEE DEMOCRATS: “Eliminating law-abiding gun owners is a good ‘first step’ towards a ‘civil society.’”

Votes on HB815 and HB1263 were split along party lines in the Senate Public Health Committee Wednesday night with the committee Democrats voting 6-4 and 6-3 to send the bills to the full senate. If these two bills become law, they will resulting most, if not all ranges in the state going out of business as well as the banning of ALL semiautomatic rifles, pistols and shotguns as well as banning all pump shotguns and rifles.

In comments made during testimony, committee Democrats stated plainly that HB815 and HB1263 were “first steps” and that these bills have as their objective the creation of a “more civil society.” In other words, elimination of lawful gun owners is a required first step for creating a more civil society. Of course, there was no mention of the impact of eliminating criminals.

HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO ON THURSDAY:

1. Call Senator Dave Syverson at REDACTED and tell him “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263.

2. Call Senator Shane Cultra at REDACTED and tell him “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263.

3. Call Senator Christine Johnson at REDACTED and tell her “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263.

4. Call Senator Carole Pankau at REDACTED and tell her “THANK YOU” for supporting lawful gun owners by voting “NO” on HB815 and HB1263.

It is very important that you praise these Senators for their support.

The ringleader of the effort to shut down shooting ranges and take your guns away from you is Senator Dan Kotowski. You may wish to call him at REDACTED and politely explain to him that, as a law-abiding gun owner, you do not appreciate being treated like a criminal and that you oppose any efforts to regulate shooting ranges, ban semiautomatic firearms, or ban standard capacity magazines.

2. Ban all semi-automatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns as well as pump action shotguns.

.455 Webley is a British handgun cartridge, most commonly used in the Webley top break revolvers.  The .455 cartridge was a service revolver cartridge, featuring a rimmed cartridge firing a .45 bullet at the relatively low velocity of 650 ft/s (190 m/s). The result was a cartridge and handgun combination with relatively mild recoil, but with good penetration and excellent stopping power. It was rated superior to the .45 Colt in stopping power in the disputed United States Thompson-LaGarde Tests of 1904.

This shotgun can hold 2 3/4 or 3"" shells and comes with a modified choke that is removable.  It is nearly a carbon copy of the popular Remington 870 models.  This gun has had roughly 20-30 rounds through it but has some wear and tear from joining me as a back up shot gun on a few hunting trips.  The gun works flawlessly and I have never had a problem shooting it.  In the pictures below you can see a slight bit of damage to the buttstock pad.  That is the only thing wrong with the firearm and it is very minor.  I am also open to trades so feel free to throw me an offer.  In order to purchase this firearm you must have a valid ID and be over the age of 18.  You must not have any criminal history or history of mental illness.

Like new as pictured, includes 3 13-round magazines (which won't be around much longer, from the sounds of it).

See a shooting video of the same model AR-15 here slamming steel at 100 yds: 
Bushmaster AR-15 in ACTION: Reliable, Tough...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2-LEQO0utQ

I have for sale a new, never fired, Bushmaster XM15-E2S AR-15. It comes with:

an integrated picatinny rail for mounting sights and various optics

a telescoping butt-stock

2-Point sling

an additional sling attachment for left or right hand quick release slings

A2 Birdcage flash suppressor

and two magazines (One in picture + One more).


This rifle is equipped with a low profile gas block so your line of sight through optics aren't obstructed by a fixed front sight post, and provides more options for accessorizing with other handguards (if you don't like the handguard it comes with).

Asking $1,600 for the rifle. I'll include a slightly (once) used rifle cleaning kit as well. I realized that my other kit had mostly everything I needed so I'd like to get rid of the second one and just buy a couple of the parts I need individually...so yeah, you can have the cleaning kit too.

NOTE: In addition to the rifle, FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED, I can also include a brand new Trijicon reflex sight (1X magnification) which never needs batteries, and adjusts instantly to your lighting conditions. To purchase the rifle with the Trijicon optic I'm asking $2,100. This sight alone is new and sells for $580 in stores, so this combo price is taking $80 off a brand new optic .

Again, I'm asking $1,600 for the rifle and $2,100 for the rifle/optic combo. 

Of course the boxes, manuals and everything else that comes with the rifle and optic are included."

Like what everyone else is saying, better get it while you can. I did take it out last weekend and ran 60 rounds through it without a single problem. 

Pretty much what the title says.. I also have a 5 round mag and the standard rail cover without the tri-mount. The stock has a crumby snow camo job that can easily be removed with paint thinner to get it back to its amazingly dull nylon green.
