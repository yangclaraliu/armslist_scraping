Probably a few things I'm forgetting. I have shot a few sub M.O.A. groups with this rifle. This rifle is done / complete, sighted in and ready to shoot!! See below for guns I'm willing to take as partial trade or make an offer for multiple guns on my list and maybe we can work something out for the full package. I'm not looking for a straight across trade for any one firearm. Cash is still the best. More pictures available upon request. I am looking for a 1 gun trade plus cash or a multiple gun trade.

Heres the skinny, Three of the five are fine. Two of them need repair. One of the black rims has a small crack in it and is bent, and the one that isn't painted has a nasty bend and the tire is blown. These two do not hold air. The other three hold air but need new tires, I would estimate the tread as less than 60%. I bought them because I needed some spare tires, Don't know how much it would be to fix thru tire barn but it doesn't look like to bad a fix if you have a welder and a grinder.

Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger Vaquero has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority. It is often referred to as ""the gun that won the New West"" because of its widespread popularity among single-action shooters and cowboy action competitors. 


MSRP:  $599.99


Since this pistol is NOT new (only @ 30 rounds put through it), I will let it go for less.  I am asking $500.00 OBO (on a cash deal), and if it goes to trade want around $550.00 in trade value.

It comes with the ORIGINAL CABELA'S plastic box, owner's manual, and RUGER padlock.  I will also include 50 rounds of REMINGTON UMC 125 grain ammo.  This is a GORGEOUS pistol and is very clean.  Even though I do not shoot it, I do take it fromt he safe and clean it out every now and then.  BEAUTIFUL!!!!  

This pistol has been locked away in the safe since bought.  It was taken to the range (a long time ago) and tried out.  It shot nice but was not used again since that one range try-out.  

Interested parties can call me at REDACTED.  i live inthe Los Lunas area but will be more than willing to meet you in Albuquerque if you wish.  LOCAL DEALS ONLY!  I will not ship to another state!"

This pistol is not new and so i will not ask for that price.  This pistol barely has about 25 rounds put through it and was going to be used for concealed carry, but I decided to go with another pistol.  This pistol was bought around 10 years ago and still looks BRAND NEW and locked away in my safe.  it was almost forgotten until I opted for a concealed carry, but I decided on a .45ACP instead.

This pistol is PERECT for a woman who cannot pull the slide back on a semi-auto pistol.  This pistol is perfect for home defense, concealed carry, or as a back-up weapon.  It is a POWERFUL little guy and ammo can be bought anywhere as it is so plentiful.

This package includes the original manual, original box, the original bore brush, 2 safety lock keys (this pistol comes equipped with a hammer that you can lock with a key), 30 rounds of 38 special (LAWMAN 158 grain), and a BRAND NEW box of HORNADY 38 SPECIAL 110 grain FTX (defense rounds).


I will let this pistol go for $350.00 (in a cash deal) or for around $400.00 in trade value.

Interested parties can call me at REDACTED.  I live in the Los Lunas area but will be more than happy to take it to Albuquerque if you are truly interested in seeing it.  LOCAL DEALS ONLY!  I will not ship it to another state."

Stag is the commercial division of Continental Machine & Tool, who have manufactured receivers and trigger components for Colt, Rock River, S&W, etc. Their rifles are hand-fit, with some of the tightest tolerances in the industry. Don't buy that DPMS or the parts-bin frankenstein build before considering a quality mil-spec factory rifle. 

Rifle is new and unfired, in perfect condition. Comes in the factory case with all original literature, warranty card and accessories. Includes one 30rd magazine full of new ammo.

At Ruger, our motto is ""Arms Makers for Responsible Citizens."" It is not just a slogan; it is genuine recognition that millions of law-abiding citizens use our firearms safely and responsibly every day. We are mechanics, doctors, teachers, police officers, firemen, nurses, factory workers, and every other occupation you can name. We are a vast and too-often silent majority ... and our rights are under attack.

Make Your Voice Heard Too!

Given the forces assembling against us, merely relying upon lobbying efforts is insufficient. Law-abiding firearms owners must stand up and be heard. This affects all of us, so we cannot stand idly by and rely upon others to fight on our behalf. Too much is at stake. Visit our Protect Your Rights web page to learn more about how you can take action and be heard today!

Step one: On that page, you can tell your legislators you care about gun rights, either with the Take Action Now! link, which allows you to send a prepared email letter quickly and easily. Or the Find Your Representatives link, which has detailed contact information for each of your legislators so, if you prefer, you can call them or write them a more personal letter.

Step two: Get all your friends to help support our rights; ask them to click on the link and send letters too. Forward this email to your friends and encourage them to take action too.

More: Many elected officials have been looking for an opportunity to curtail our gun rights and think they can win now if they move quickly while emotions are high. In Washington D.C. and in state legislatures across the country, anti-gun forces are gathering and conspiring in an effort to pass bad legislation that goes beyond anything we have ever seen. At least one legislature is discussing making public the identity of all pistol permit holders, treatment typically reserved for convicted sex offenders.

Reality seems to be lost on these folks. Cities like Washington D.C. and Chicago, with some of the strictest gun laws on the books, are hotbeds of violent crime. Nationally, violent crime involving firearms has declined since the expiration of the Federal ""assault weapons ban,"" while lawful ownership of firearms has increased. More lawful gun ownership, less crime.

To help your voice be heard, use this special service on our website now. 

Please act now, before it's too late."

This is an earlier production gun with satin nickel finish and factory walnut grips. Notably, it does not have the unsightly warning on the right side of the slide: ""Retract slide to see if loaded. Does not fire without magazine."" OK, good advice for inexperienced users. I'd rather not see it on my pistol.

These are highly regarded pistols, in production for decades now, but no longer available with the nickel finish. The 85 has 8 + 1 shot capacity, and should still be legal in all states. It's approved for sale in CA. The model 84 is the same gun with a wider grip frame to accept a 13-round magazine.

I'm selling this on consignment for the owner and have not fired it myself. Inspection of the gun suggests that it has been fired very little. It was carried as an off-duty gun and only the grips show some signs of use.

Comes with a Bianchi 6X suede holster and a Bianchi 20A leather holder for the second magazine. The holster is made specifically for the Beretta 84 and is not a generic item. It's in good condition. The clip holder is like new, with only a small mark on the front.

It's clean inside and out. It has been disassembled and cleaned and lubed. You're not buying a weekend cleaning project. The chrome plated bore is clean and shiny throughout, as new, with no traces of copper and no defects. The outside of the barrel shows no wear from functioning.

The outside remains about new, with the only noticeable marks being on the frame front and back straps (see photos 33 and 34) and a tiny mark on the front left edge of the slide, forward of the ""Pietro"" mark (photo 6).

The grips are solid with no signs of cracks or splitting. The right panel has a small spot on the forward edge where the finish is missing. See photo 32. A dab of varnish or polyurethane would work if you wanted to fix it. The left panel has a few marks near the bottom edge, near the screw, as shown in photo 31. Overall, though, the grips are good.

The gun has magazine disconnect safety, meaning that it cannot be fired once the magazine has been removed.

The slide-mounted lever serves as a safety and decocker.

Comes with the two original factory 8-round magazines. They have been disassembled and cleaned. Both magazines suffer from a tiny crack at the rear corner of the right lip, best seen with a magnifying glass. A not uncommon defect which does not affect functioniong and was not known to the owner of the pistol. See the photo.

The buyer pays only the actual shipping and insurance cost, no ""handling"" fees. Should be about $15, depending on your ZIP code.

I must collect sales tax or a resale certificate from California buyers.

A personal check is OK if you don't mind waiting ten banking days before shipment. If you're in a hurry, use a money order or bank check.

E-mail if you have any questions about the gun. Note that I can't access my e-mail every day, so don't despair if I don't answer right away.

Serious buyers only. This is sold as a set and will not be broken up. Many parts are truly custom made to match. Also I dont want to spend five years selling off piece by piece things that went to a match set. I may lose money this way... Oh well. Wont sell to amateurs (if you dont know what some of this equipment is then your an amateur). I'd like to see a military buyer to be honest. Dont ask to buy the magazines or ammo only. If you plan to pay out then plan on picking it all up... Way to much to ship and way to expensive! If your Army let me know!

SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY PLEASE. DON'T EMAIL ME IF YOU'RE JUST GOING TO ASK IF IT IS STILL FOR SALE AND THEN NOT REPLY BACK TO ME

I am selling my MSAR STG-556 in order to buy a motorcycle, I hate to part with it as it is a great rifle but alas I must make the sacrifice.

This is a fantastic little rifle, I have never had a single issue with it in the times I have used it. It is ambidextrous and balanced so perfectly you could even easily fire it with one hand. Feeds perfectly from both MSAR and Steyr magazines.

Comes with 1-10 round magazine and 1-30 round magazine, also comes with a Bushnell T-Dot optic sight mounted on the top rail of the rifle. The rail is a perfect height to mount any optic you may own. The optic itself is valued at $250 but despite it's price I've had a great experience with it, you wont find a better optic for that price. If you have no need for the T-Dot and wish to mount your own optic I am willing to knock $25 off the price as I am not really adding the value of it to the price of the rifle. This rifle also features a forward assist and an M-16 style bolt hold open device. It takes both MSAR mags and the original AUG mags. In my opinion these are far superior to STANAG.

Keep in mind MSAR no longer makes this rifle so you won't find very many floating around pretty soon. It will only go up in value as the new Assault Weapons Ban approaches.

Contact me if interested, and please take good care of it as I have, this truly is one of the best firearms I've ever owned and it kills me to part with it.

I have seen most of the used listings for this rifle priced at around $1,500 with no accessories but I need the money fast so I'm knocking $200 off the value. Due to that the price is firm, I am not willing to negotiate. I will however consider trades for a decent Sport-Bike (motorcycle).

I apologize but I do not have any pictures of the rifle itself, I lost them all when I reformatted my computer. I can assure you it is in perfect condition and I will post pictures of the exact model, keep in mind some of the pictures may have optics mounted on the rail that are not the same as the one on mine.

Remember, we have a probable Assault Weapons Ban coming up and this rifle is discontinued so it is going to be pretty hard to find very soon and the value will only go up.

Yes, you can try to get these at Sportsmans (they have not had any shipments of these since 1/4) and if you do, more power to you. Or you can backorder on a few sites that say they will be ready in February. However, in that case if the ban goes into effect this month, they can't finish the deal.

So, if you want them before they are banned - here are some. If you can find them less elsewhere, good job, buy them up.

Buy 4 or more, cut price to $57 each.

I can meet during the week in the evenings or on weekends, in NE Colorado Springs area or Monument.

If you want to pay via Paypal that is possible since I will pick a wifi hotspot, we can do the transaction inside and that way you can put these on plastic (Paypal will add 3% for ANY transaction, even personal gifts) which you would incur.

If you contact me about these I will hold however many you want until the evening (b/w 6-7) of the next day."

Sale is for:
New In Box Bushmaster Carbon 15 (see below for details)
NIB* 2 PMAG 30 round magazines
120 rounds factory 556

AR15 Bushmaster Carbon 15 W/16” chrome-moly steel w/chrome-lined bore/chamber, 5.56 NATO/223 Remington, weighs 5.5lbs unloaded.

This gun is new in the box, unfired, never even chambered. It has a 3 position collapsible stock (factory says 6, I count 3), Bushnell red dot 1X30 scope, and 1 (factory) – 30 round mag. (sight was removed from box and mounted for picture sake)

BONUS:  2 NIB* Magpul PMAGs.  One mag was pulled out of the package to help show the windows on these magazines.  Neither ever used or even loaded.

2X BONUS:  You can't find .223/5.56 ammo lately, but with this gun you'll get to run 120 rounds through once you take possession!

CATCH - I will NOT sell to just anyone, therefore you will encounter a $30 charge (in addition to the sale price) to go through an FFL.  You can pick one, or use mine (only avail Tues-Fri).  This means you will pay me (see payment methods below) at the FFL (you will walk away immediately with the ammo and pmags) fill out the background check, and pay the FFL $30 when your check comes back.  Be aware, there is a 6-7 day lag on checks right now, so the FFL will hold your gun during this time.   Sorry, that's just the way it is (similar procedure as to buying in an online auction, or even from a dealer locally).  If you want to bypass the background check you'll need to go elsewhere.

Payment - Cash, or Paypal instant payment (3% fee incurred by you if you pay via Credit Card, but if you want to use plastic you can; if you want help setting up a Paypal account, I'll help you).  
NO CERTIFIED CHECKS, NO MONEY ORDERS.

REDACTED b/w 6am and 8pm daily
If this ad is still up, chances are it's still available.
If you leave a message, leave a name and number as I don't have caller id.

Want it shipped?  Paypal instant payment or USPS money orders.  When the money order clears, I will ship to your FFL (must email me FFL info, or include with MO).  No cashiers checks or other money orders taken in case of shipping.

Model 700 Stainless R5 Mil-Spec
Black Stock w/ Green Webbing
This is a great rifle and personal favorite of the local long range 308 crowd.
Features a M700 stainless steel barreled action with a 24 inch R5 mil-spec barrel, the same barrel used in the M-24 sniper rifles. Varmint barrel with 11.25 inch twist rate with five lands and grooves and eleven degree target crown. Stock has aluminum bedding in block in standard VS configuration.

""Offering this Model 700 for ten years is a testimony to the popularity and acceptance by shooters wanting to own an exceptionally accurate rifle at a reasonable price,"" states Category Manager, Dave Regula. At the core of the 700 with 5-R Rifling is the machined stainless steel, cylindrical Model 700 receiver design ensuring uniformity, strength and solid bedding area. Unique to this precision rifle is the 24-inch stainless steel, heavy barrel featuring 5-R Tactical Rifling -- the same hammer-forged barrel used on the M-24 sniper rifles.

The 5-R Rifling barrel features five lands with a right hand twist which allows for less bearing surface on the bullet for slightly increased velocity.

As a result of less bullet drag, copper fouling in the bore is reduced ensuring long-term accuracy and consistency. The barrel is offered with a 110 target-style crown and a 1 in 11.25-inch twist.

The rock-solid barreled action is full-length, aluminum bedded into a well-designed H-S Precision stock for enhanced stability and shot-to-shot consistency. Add Remington's X-Mark Pro® externally adjustable trigger, designed to ""break-like-glass"" and set at 3.5 pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical-like accuracy."

This interesting weapon started its life in around 1982, when a small Australian company Armstech decided to develop a new assault rifle for Australian army trials. Prototype weapons were produced in a very short amount of time, but Australian army eventually selected for adoption an already established foreign weapon, the Austrian-made Steyr AUG. Nevertheless, Armstech kept developing and produced a series of interesting weapons, all in bullpup layout (and some firing caseless ammunition of indigenous design), but neither went past prototype stage. In around 1990 Armstech went belly up, and rights to the rifle that fired conventional ammunition was sold to another Australian company, known as Edenpine. Further development at Edenpine resulted in SAK 30 prototype, but company found that there's no market for such weapon in peaceful Australia. Therefore, in early 1990s Edenpine found an American company, Bushmaster Firearms Inc, which finalized the prototype and put it into production in 1994, just before the infamous ""Assault weapons ban"". Bushmaster designated new rifle as M17s and produced it in somewhat limited numbers up until 2005, when it was dropped from Bushmaster products line. It must be noted that demise of Bushmaster M17s was caused mostly by general preferences of American gun market, which is rather shy on bullpups; therefore, Bushmaster company decided to concentrate on much better selling rifles, patterned after Ar-15 / M16 or M4.
The M17s is a self-loading rifle, and thus cannot be classified as a true ""assault rifle"". Nevertheless it could make a very good paramilitary of home defense weapon; it is also good plinker and all-around compact rifle in .223 caliber, combining rifle-length barrel with carbine-style short overall length.
The M17s rifle is gas operated weapon that uses short-stroke gas piston, located above the barrel. Locking is achieved by rotary bolt with seven lugs; bolt is hosted in massive Ar-18-style bolt carrier, which rides on dual guide rods. The charging handle is somewhat unusual as it forms the rear part of the integral carrying handle, and therefore it is fully ambidextrous. The cocking handle slot on the top of receiver is covered by sliding dust cover. The receiver of weapon is a composite affair, consisting of extruded aluminum upper part and polymer lower part. Upper part houses barrel, gas system and bolt group. Lower receiver is made integral with pistol grip and houses trigger unit and magazine housing. Upper and lower receivers are connected by two push-out cross-pins. Ejection port is made on the right side of the weapon only, and there's no provisions for left-hand ejection. Nevertheless, weapon is more or less ambidextrous in regard to controls, as push-button safety (located at the front of triggerguard) and magazine release buttons are made ambidextrous too. M17s will accept all M16 / Ar-15 type magazines. The top of the carrying handle is fitted with Weaver-style accessory rail which will accept any compatible scope mounts, and also hosts a rudimentary backup open sight."
