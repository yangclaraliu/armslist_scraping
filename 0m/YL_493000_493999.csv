 This gun was made between 60-68. Colt commisioned Astra to make thier
 Colt Junior .25acp pistols before the 68 import ban.
 This is a copy between the 1908 style Colts and the then new Juniors. 
Its made of all steel, its in VERY good condition with somewhere between 200-300 rounds through it.
 The blueing is near perfect some lightening but no metal showing at all, and NO rust what so ever.
 I just had it serviced and everything is working to 100%. 
It is hammerless and has 3 safetys on it. 
1: regular safety above trigger
 2: backstrap safety like the early Colt hammerless 1908's
 3: with magazine out it wont fire

In the past few years I've only seen a handfull of these up for auction or being sold. They are just that good of pocket pistol and go BANG everytime.

You will get the gun, 1-6 round clip, Bianchi thick leather holster, and 30 rounds of FMJ ammo. ATTENTION I JUST PUT A SET OF NOS JAY SCOTT GRIPS ON! VERY HARD TO FIND AND IT GIVES IT A MUCH BETTER GRIP AND MAKES IT LOOK NICER. THEY WHERE $45 SHIPPED.

I'm asking $250 FIRM for it cause its well worth it when you see it. Pictures
 just dont do it justice.

You can contact me through this ad then I will give you my #. 
I will also trade for other firearms. If you have a trade please send pictures and tell me what it is.

This was a special run of 2,500 matte round butt 586's in the late 80's. It has a one small scratch on the cylinder that I couldn't get to show up in the picture. I'd rate it at 99.9%. It's really more of a satin finish than matte, especially if you hold it up next to something like a glock it almost looks semi-gloss.  Comes with soft case.  

From the s&w standard catalog:

Special production run from 1989. These were made with the matte blue finish, as well as round butt grip frames, which were not a standard feature on longer barrel guns back then. These were made in both 4"" and 6"" versions.
The 4"" was product code 103591, 2500 mfd.
The 6"" was product code 103592, 2500 mfd."

Just answer this question---how are you as an ordinary citizen going to check to see if a gun is stolen using a serial number?  The police are not not going to help you, because they can't---I had a gun stolen and asked the police for help---they told me that under current laws nobody except the dealer you bought from is required OR allowed to keep info regarding a firearm purchase past 2 weeks, and there is no state or local database maintained on stolen or missing firearms.  So you get a serial number---what are you going to do to make yourself feel all warm and fuzzy?  Google it?  I'm not trying to be funny or derisive, I'm just pointing out that there really is no mechanism for you to check, so you can waste the motion and energy but it won't prove anything.  Besides, laws have already proven that unless it can be proven that you KNOW that a firearm is stolen or that you're selling to someone who is prohibited from owning a firearm you can't be charged with a crime.  The worst that can happen is that someday, somewhere you could have to surrender a gun if through some weird circumstance an owner could prove it was stolen, ie insurance claim.  Other than that---knock yourself out, but it's not going to get you anywhere, and it might cost you a gun you want to buy or a buyer when you're looking to sell.  My $0.02 and my experience."

This is a really nice collector's/enthusiast's piece, good as a safe queen, to carry or for the range.  I am including the original Colt 6 round magazine as well as a brand new Kimber Pro-Tac 7 round mag with two sizes of bump pad.  The mag also sits flush with the grip if you don't use a pad.  FYI, the larger bump pad is pictured on it currently, but I have the smaller one as well.  Being nearly 25 years old, I have the original styrofoam inserts it came in with the books, but not the cardboard box.  I can include a basic hard case to keep it safe.

I recently added a set of brand new Pachmayr Colt Medallioned wrap around grips.  They really are slick, and run $75 alone.  I of course still have the Colt Medallioned black wood grips as well.  It has been fired, but very little and even has no idiot scratch on the frame.  This really is a great pistol, but I already have a few other Colts so I am letting this one go.

My shop here gave me a value of $1k in the condition it is in, but I think that's a little high.  I will take $700 for it, but am firm.  If your brother's, cousin's former room mate knows where you can get a late 80's stainless Colt Officer for half the price let me know where it is because i'll buy it, ha! asking for $700 for everything"

In law enforcement there’s no room for second guessing. You’ve got to have that same confidence in your equipment. That’s why more agencies choose PR-24®. Control batons, the most field-tested batons ever made. PR-24® side handle batons offer maximum protection and the professional advantage. This design is the most field-tested baton for blocking, controlling and striking. 

Engineered For Officer Safety 
•Comfortable to carry and easily opened with a flick of the wrist 
•Morse tapers, the tight locking joints, make the baton feel solid in your hand 
•The distinct sound of the baton expanding sends a signal to the suspect that you are armed and ready.
•Pull the shaft out by the patented Power Safety Tip™ to maintain element of surprise. It provides more weight-forward kinetic energy, allowing the baton to open faster in a combat situation. Fewer strikes also mean added safety for the officer. 
•The end cap utilizes a bore guide that centers the end shaft over the retention spring, reducing the retention-spring breakage that often occurs in non-Monadnock end-cap designs
•Choose from a variety of tips and grips
•Limited Lifetime guarantee
•Made in the USA

It also has aftermarket Tru-Dot Meprolight Green/Green tritium/fiber optic sights. These are the brightest sights I have seen from both bright sunlight to pitch darkeness. Must be seen to be believed.

This gun has been my carry gun, but wear is minimal. Round count is in excess of about 1500, but it is still solid and feeds and fires reliably.

With sights and additional accessories I am asking $475 o.b.o., or trades as listed below.

I also have a .357 Ruger GP100 4"" lnib listed if interested.

It comes with the blue case, both buttplates (it has the longer one on it now), and the Sig Magazine (not shown). Will sell it for the $1050 I have in it or would consider some partial trades. SIG 556's are piston operated of course.

Rifle with Scope/Rings/Sling/Extra Magazine - $600
Rifle No Scope/No Extra Mag/No Rings/No sling - $500

Simply this rifle is no longer in production and will NOT be imported into the U.S. any longer. There were far fewer CZ452fs chambered in .22 W.M.R than were produced in .22lr making this rifle a high demand item. This is a high quality Walnut and Blued steel rifle and will last for generations. Rifle is in great condition and will make a beautiful addition to any collection. This rifle has less than 300 rounds through it and shoot lights out! This rifle is both affordable and an absolute joy to shoot.

Cash is King and will take it, but I may be interested in trades, .223/5.56 ammunition - 55gr or heavier or 9mm etc. Tell me what you have to offer. 

Please do not low ball. If you want a cheap rimfire rifle then go buy a Marlin/Savage. But be assured this rifle will shoot circles around them and look damn good while doing it. Only legitimate buyers please.

In many cases the asking price is retail or higher! The ONLY thing I can think of is that you payed to much to start with.  I guess you can ask whatever you want and might find a dummy from time to time. Perhaps you should find a friend or someone with an FFL or go to a gun show to find out what the going rate is.
