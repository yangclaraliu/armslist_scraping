Hileman,"North of Portland, Portland, Oregon",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, January 17, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"They are beautiful T.J. Hileman original photographs from the 1920's and are portraits of Blackfoot Native Americans. Both photographs will be in identical frames. (I am in the process of picking up a 2nd frame for the unframed photograph) Both photographs have T.J. Hilemans, stamp imprinted down towards either the bottom right or left corner of the photo. It says ""Hileman"" and it's done in a way you can feel the imprint like it's raised on the photo side and indented on the underside. They also both have some writing on the back that describes the subject matter on the front and have the date of 1927. A couple of the other photographs from my collection, had similar writing on the back, but they also had a stamp by Glacier National Park, and wording to the effect of this photo is by T.J. Hileman, copyright. I had a total of 5 Hileman photographs all from the 1920's. I really only want to keep 1 or 2, and I just sold 2 of them this month. So I am willing to part with 1 or maybe 2 of my remaining 3 photographs.

I am looking for $300-$350 each in trade. If you do some research you will find Hileman photo's of Native American's only come up for auction every couple years, so they are hard to find. I found about 6-8 examples over the past decade that have sold in auctions and the auction prices varied from $250 on the low end up to $1,200 at the highest (to be honest that was quite a lot, more than double any of the other photographs except for one signed by the Chief that was pictured in the portrait) T.J. Hileman lived in Kalispell, Montana near Glacier National Park, and was know for his photographs of Glacier National Park and the Blackfoot Native American Indians.(quite a few Glacier National Park postcards from 1911-1940 would have been photographs taken by Hileman) He was also the official photographer for the Great Northern Railroad. 

I also have a half a dozen railroad calendars from the late 1920's and the 1930's with artwork depicting Blackfoot Native American's by Winold Reiss of New York. (I am in the process of taking photographs of these currently, but email me if interested)

Short Yugo Correct flash horn hider and original M92 trigger group (Tapco G2 installed) 2x 30 round Yugo mags, Yugo cleaning kit, Yugo Military Sling, and mag/ammo pouch.
 This is an original Yugoslavian Military factory Short Barreled AK47 with a 10.5 inch barrel with a 5.5inch spot welded hollow horn style flash hider to make it 16inch legal rifle without having to obtain an SBR stamp first. It can be removed and the original short horn flash hider re-enstalled once you obtain your tax stamp for an SBR weapon. This is truely a collectors AK47 and the absolute rarest of the Yugo factory made Short Barreled AK47 and it's NEW. Look around you will not be able to find one like this anywhere! This is not a cheapo Romainian WASR 10/63 AK or Chineese Norinco made AK crap that people here are asking tripple price for...this is the absolute best AK47 made next to an original Russian made AK!! I had two of them...this is my last one!

*Note* The last picture only shows what it would look like as it was originally made from the factory as an SBR (Short Barreled Rilfe) If you were to buy one already as an SBR you would have to wait 8 months for the stamp before you could even take possession of it! with mine you can buy it now, take possession of it, shoot it, enjoy it, and at your leasure get you tax stamp to make it an SBR if you choose to!

See, when items are in high demand people are willing to pay more for them. It's called the free market and it's called that because people are free to price thier goods at any price they deem fit. Folks who are looking for those products are free to purchase them or not. No one holds a gun to their heads.

 Just because you don't agree with current prices has no bearing on anything. You, like the rest of the self appointed jerk offs in this society who seem to know what's best for everyone else just need to worry about your own lives and leave the rest of us the hell alone.

This is a compact semi-automatic with single action trigger and tip-up barrel.  The gun also has an external safety lever.  The gun has inlaid gold with accented hammer, screws, trigger, and magazine plate.  I spoke with Beretta USA and was told that this firearm was manufactured in 1985.  Gun has no box—but does include an owner’s manual for the 950 series.  Included is one magazine.  Gun has approximately 30 rounds through it.  The bore is bright and clean, and the gun is in excellent, like new condition.

Buyer will be required to complete transfer at a FFL dealer or the Maryland State Police barracks.  For details on the requirements please see DPSCS website at: http://www.mdgunsafety.com/mspfaq.htm.  

The gun will need to be held seven days after transfer.

According to the DPSCS website:

“Can two residents of this state conduct a transfer between themselves? If so, what is required by law?   Yes, provided both parties conduct the transaction with the Maryland State police or a Regulated Firearms Dealer, (the Dealer may charge an additional $20.00 dollars for this transaction), and the buyer is not prohibited by law from receiving or possessing a firearm. This transaction classified as a Secondary Sale. Both parties must be present during the transaction, and there is a Seven Day Waiting Period before the firearm can be physically transferred. In addition, there is a $10.00 dollar background check fee (Check or Money Order, Absolutely No Cash Accepted), the check must be made out to the Maryland State Police.”"

Chambered in 357 magnum/38 special. When I talked to a S&W Rep. on the phone for a replacement key (for the internal lock) he had said that the serial number would date the production to December of 2008. As for the gun, the only thing that has been done to it was installing a Hogue monogrip. I have only put about 25 rounds of 357 and 30 rounds of 38 through it. Thoroughly cleaned after shooting. Fixed front sight (removable, but not adjustable) and notched rear sight. It is extremely accurate, and would easily hit a quarter size bulls-eye at 10+ yards. The trigger is smooth with a 2.5lb SA and 9lb DA trigger pull. Comes with the gun, a pistol sock, and the key.

For the right deal, I also have some accessories. I have two Quickstrips, two Safariland speedloaders, a Crossbreed Supertuck IWB holster, a smaller fabric IWB/Pocket holster, a kydex trigger guard used for waistband carry without a holster, and some defense ammo. 

I would much rather trade since some people are asking outrageous prices for their firearms up here on Armslist, and Gander Mtn./other stores are picked over, making it difficult to get a new firearm. Please do not contact me with lowball offers. Like I said before, I am more interested in trading for specific firearms and am not in a rush to get rid of it.

Specs and info:

One of our ALL TIME BEST Carbine models, the M4 Type features a distinctive Military Barrel Profile and Six Position Telestock – great for 3 Gun Match Shooting, Home Defense and Law Enforcement use.

The Bushmaster A2 & A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are modeled after our M4 Type Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individual officers (semi-automatic configuration with 16"" barrel).

The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon.

Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling.

The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters.

The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage).

Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs.

The Bushmaster A2/A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are shipped complete with 30 round magazine, safety and operational manual, and carry sling.

Product Description
Ultra High Precision (UHP):  The most finely machined lowers on the market.
 
FFL Required
 
The BRP Corp Ultra High Precision (UHP) 15 was specifically made to meet our need for a rugged and precise lower receiver for our XMG Belt-Fed rifles. We hold half of the mil-spec tolerance to ensure exact fits and smooth function.  These lower receivers are fully compatible with common AR parts and accessories.
 
These lower receivers are machined from forged 7075 aluminum blanks using only the best tooling available.  We take our time making these and it shows in the quality of the machining. Not only are the milled slots and reamed holes precise, they are also clean and smooth.  The internal machining is among the cleanest you will ever see in an AR-type rifle.  Once machined and checked, our receivers are hard-coat anodized.  
 
Call or email to reserve your lower now, taking preorders first come. Will be ready to ship by next Tues.

400,http://www.armslist.com/posts/764400,For Trade:  1.00  Keltec PMR 30 with Crimson Trace,"Youngstown, Ohio, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Saturday, December 29, 2012",Handguns,Kel-Tec                                                                                ,22 Magnum,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"YOU: This add is directed toward SERIOUS gun collectors who own multiple AK's and have one to spare.

Up for your trade consideration is a soon to be discontinued Kel-Tec PMR 30 with a Crimson Trace Laser and FIVE 30 ROUND factory magazines(Also, I have 900 rounds of ammo that I will include if needed to make a deal). 

The value of these .22 magnums literally doubled overnight and CONTINUES TO RISE. The cost of the magazines alone has already TRIPLED as they were hard to acquire BEFORE the craze. In fact, recently, on gunbroker.com, a used PMR with a no name laser and 2 magazines sold for $1,275. That is twice what that gun sold for the previous week. And that's no bs.

The reason for the sudden jump in value is because Kel-Tec, for some reason, has manufactured these guns in LIMITED quantities over a very short period of time. Subsequently, there are only so many PMR 30's in circulation. And, soon, due to their fixed high capacity, they will cease to be made. 

So, if you are a SERIOUS collector, you are aware of what this gun will be worth several years down the road. So am I. So, fellas, consider this opportunity before I change my mind.

ME: Let me start by saying that, currently, I own a mint MAK 90 AK. Because of this, I AM NOT DESPERATE to own another AK. I am aware that there are a GAZILLION AK's in circulation as it is the most prolific rifle ever manufactured. Therefore, I understand that, in the long run, they will only be worth so much. In fact, when this craze is over, their current overpriced value will absolutely level off and correct itself.  Nevertheless, I have always enjoyed AK's(I shoot mine)and would like to own another. 

WRAP UP: If you are a SERIOUS gun collector who understands the gun market and owns numerous AK's with one to spare, I would like to hear from you. Quite possibly, we can strike up some kind of deal. Just know that, I ALREADY OWN A QUALITY AK and AM NOT DESPERATE to own another. As I said, I simply like AK's."

Caliber:   .300 AAC Blackout

Barrel Length:  16""

Color:  Black

Capacity:  30rd

NO SIGHTS MODEL

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, v5-300 AAC Blackout comes in two different configurations no sights or fixed front/rear sights.

The 300 BlackOut is designed to be shot suppressed and un-surpressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions.  The testing of the Daniel Defense 300 BlackOut firearms indicates that un-surpressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend.  Although, though our extensive testing we did ascertain that the utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-surpressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.

I bought it used two years ago when I was buying broken down vehicles to part out on the side but now I really have no need for it. Although the car hauler is a little smaller than normal (13' Long x 6.5' Wide) it will actually accommodate large trucks and SUV's without a problem. As you can see in the pictures below, the car hauler has an extended neck so, unlike many other car hauler designs, you can pull a vehicle all the way to the front of this one and let the bumper extend over the neck. In addition, this car hauler has two other design features that I love: it gently slopes at the back (to allow you to load vehicles that sit lower to the ground) and it has wheel guides welded from front to back (which help you keep vehicles straight when loading them).  Overall, this car hauler is in excellent condition both cosmetically and mechanically. I probably put less than 500 miles on it over the two years I have owned it has never given me the first problem.

I am asking $1300 firm for the car hauler, but I am more interested in partial/full trades."

2. The offer is what the gun is worth to me, not you. If you believe the gun is worth more, then please seek another buyer after you receive my offer.

The pro series is factory machined to accept moon clips for speedier reloads, which is nice, and has NO INTERNAL LOCK. Comes with box/papers, 3 moon clips, 2 Bianchi speed strips, a Galco stow-n-go IWB holster, a DeSantis clip grip(new version of a Barami hip grip), and also a used Uncle Mikes combat style grip if you want it. I am looking to trade for a compact or subcompact semi-auto in good to excellent condition since this one is unfired, in a decent defensive caliber. I'd also consider a Ruger LCR, (I know it's still a revolver, but I'm always willing to try something new before i write it off.) Asking cash price of $450/obo for everything, that's less than I paid for the gun itself, and may sell gun by itself for a little less. Thanks for looking."

If you want boiler plate for an email message here's a suggestion:

Dear,

I am writing you regarding the numerous gun control schemes currently being proposed. Guns are not the problem. If guns or access to guns were the problem, then Vermont, with some of the most lenient gun laws in the country, which doesn't even require a permit to carry concealed, would not consistently have some of the lowest homicide rates in the nation. Just 1.1 homicides / per 100,000 population in 2010, which was about 1/4 of the national average. So much for argument that availability of guns increases homicide rates. 

With regard to ""assault weapons"", which are really just semi-automatic rifles; these guns are rarely used in homicides. For example in 2011, according to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, rifles, including ""assault"" rifles were used in 2.55% of homicides. The UCR does not track how many of these specifically involved an ""assault"" rifle, however, it is obviously less than 2.55% for 2011 since that is the total for ALL rifles combined. By contrast personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.) were used as the murder weapon in 5.75% of homicides in 2011 and knives and cutting instruments were used in 13.38% of homicides. Other years are similar. 

The UCR 2007 - 2011 homicide by weapon tables are here: 

www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8 

There is simply too little criminal use of these so called ""assault"" weapons which are really just semi-automatic rifles used lawfully by millions of Americans, for regulation of them to make any difference in our crime rates even if criminals obeyed laws, and, they don't. Connecticut had a 'gun free' schools law and an 'assault weapons' ban. Neither had any effect on the school shooter there, other than perhaps to guarantee his success by insuring that he was the only one armed. Compare the Sandy Hook tragedy, where nobody but the killer was armed, to the 1997 Pearl Mississippi school shooting where Vice Principal Joel Myrick was able to retrieve his handgun from his truck (it was illegal for him to possess or carry it in the school) and apprehend the shooter, Luke Woodham without Myrick firing a single shot. Luke Woodham's admitted plan after attacking his high school, was to go  to the local Jr. High and continue his rampage there. Myrick stopped that plan cold. Unfortunately, there was no ARMED Joel Myrick at Sandy Hook. 

We don't need more gun control, which has failed over and over every time it's been tried. We need real security, not useless 'feel good' measures that strip us of our constitutional rights for the mere illusion of safety. We need ARMED police officers in schools. These officers can provide security from all levels of threats as well as serve as badly needed role models for the children they protect. Giving the Joel Myricks of our country the ability to legally possess the guns they need to responsibly protect themselves and the children in their care wouldn't hurt either."

Certainly one of the most unusual-looking guns to come out is the Mossberg 500 Chainsaw. Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories

    - Quad rail
    - 200 rounds of .223/5.56 ammo (Remington & PMC)
