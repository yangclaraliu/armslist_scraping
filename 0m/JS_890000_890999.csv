I might even have the bracket I used for it as well. The best price you'll find these on eBay is for $325 or more.

This one was on my bike since August, my birthday present to myself!

There's not a blemish on it anywhere and I'll include the antenna and mount I used. I didn't use any of the wiring that came with so it's all in the box, still wrapped up, and can pass for a brand new unit.

It's still under warranty and it's all yours for $350. 


-------------------
Also, Last and far from least is an awesome Baehr UltimaXL intercom that is amazing! This is the Cat-Daddy of them all. read any intercom comparison review you want to and you'll see they all compare themselves to Baehr. they admit they aren't as good, but the also tell you that they aren't as high priced. I had this hooked to my GPS, MP3, Stereo, the JMCB, and a Bluetooth device. Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention, it was hooked to both our helmets too! It's fully automatic so you never have to adjust anything once you have it set the way you want it. It turns on when the driver's helmet is plugged up and everything is set in priority. The volume adjusts itself as you go faster and you can carry on a normal conversation just like you are setting beside the person in a car. It does not use the hateful VOX that most intercoms do. The mic is always on so when you talk, the music automatically drops to a very low level and the other person hears every word you say as clear as a bell. Anyone that has ever slipped my spare helmet on and listened has been amazed. New, this goes for $1700 and you can buy it from me for $600 and that includes the headsets and mics, as well as some of the cables I made for it. It's a real steal and you wont be sorry. I'll include plenty of paperwork for it and it even has about 1 year of warranty left. I bought it brand new so it's only been on my bike. this will fit any bike, no matter what brand, Honda, Victory, Suzuki, Kawasaki, you name it! It take a few hours to install, and you'll love it. This made the ride for me and my bride a lot better. We could talk about where to eat, what we saw while we are riding, and she could warn me of deer close to the road if I didn't see them!"

The sear and a few other internals have received a light polish to produce a great SA and DA trigger. The gun will come with three 17 round magazines. I'm asking $425 for the PT92 and 3 mags. For an extra $25, I'll throw in a set of genuine Taurus rosewood grips. They are used, but in above average condition. For an extra $5, I'll include a Beretta ""D"" spring, which lightens up both the DA and SA trigger pulls. It takes less than 5 minutes to remove both grips and change out the main spring. 

I also have a Taurus brand .22 conversion kit. This kit has had less than 50 rounds fired through it. These kits come from the factory pretty tight, so I had to cycle it on the PT92 a few times with some lapping compound in the rail groove to get it to loosen up enough to cycle properly. I fired enough rounds through it to make certain it cycled properly, which it did. It was very accurate. This kit is a great way to rack up practice time on your PT92 at a much lower cost than shooting 9mm rounds. I'm asking $275 for the conversion kit. I will not sell the conversion separately until the pistol sells. 

I would much prefer to do a FTF transaction with another Kentucky resident. I'm in Hopkinsville, but would drive up to 60 miles to do the transaction. I will require to see a Kentucky drivers license."

INFO FROM TAURUS:
This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

The walnut stock, heavy bull barrel and bolt are in as new condition. This rifle was removed from the protective wrapping and thoroughly cleaned and checked for any rusting, pitting, etc. There was none. The bolt was also disassembled and all internal parts looked pristine.  It has never been fired other than at the Kimber factory to certify its accuracy. The rifle does have an adjustable trigger that I believe can be set to under 1 pound. There is one flaw on the rifle. It has a light cut mark on the stock from when a government inventory was conducted to verify serial numbers. 

The rifle will include a set of Kimber olympic style sights, which includes a fully adjustable rear sight, and a front globe sight with a variety of inserts. All documentation, as well as the original factory packaging will be included. This rifle would be an excellent collectible, or could be set up for .22 benchrest shooting.

A few scratches on the barrel and receiver and minor wear on the trigger guard and loading gate from the mount in the squad car.

Sure, it has some light scratches in the bluing and tiny dings in the wood (and a rough-looking spot in the finish on the bottom of the stock), but they are minor considering the age of this gun. It was made BEFORE MARLIN ADDED THE UGLY CROSS-BOLT SAFETY! I added a Pachmayr decelerator pad to make it more pleasant to shoot. I can ship this rifle insured to your FFL anywhere in the continental U.S. for $525 total, and if you live in Texas I can ship it to your door!

u.s. revolver co. automatic small frame 32 S&W caliber serial number 3688 (no letter code) was manufactured in 1910, approx. 14,000 manufactured that year. these were made without a rebounding hammer and the only safety was the half cock (safety notch) do not carry with a round under the hammer. the free wheeling cylinder is the way they were made and is normal for this revolver. if timing is good (alignment of cylinder and barrel) and lock up tight (when hammer is down and trigger is to the rear) when in firing position, it should be safe with factory standard velocity 32 S&W ammo. just do not carry with a live cartridge under the hammer.

I am looking to buy either a S&W 640-1 in .357 mag. I would prefer no internal lock. Same thing goes for a model 60 (newer models) in .357. Otherwise a Ruger SP101 with the 2.5 inch barrel in .357 would be nice as well. Let me know if you have either of these and are looking to sell. In general a 640 will sell used for around $500 in a store, so they would probably only give you around $300. Same deal the Ruger. I would be willing to pay somewhere in between, maybe a little more if you have more accessories. Email me if you have anything to sell. I would also consider a Ruger LCR in .357, but those sell for 500 on sale new, so price is lower on those."
