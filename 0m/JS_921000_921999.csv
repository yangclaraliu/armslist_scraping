It is in great shape but the Allen bolt that you use to mount it to any picatinny rail is a little stripped can still be tightened but could easily be replaced since it completely detaches from the sight. Aside from that the sight is in great shape. The red dot is crisp without any of the flair you see in cheap knock offs. The windage adjustments work just fine and the protective plastic cover that slides over the sight turns the red dot off. It originally cost a little over 400 after tax.

General Features
-The Picatinny rail located on the barrel runs from the chamber area to right behind the front sight allowing the use of scope rings (optional) and aftermarket optics.
-The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up.
-The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy.
-The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate.
-Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting.
-The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition.
-The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired.

Safety
-The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters.
-When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged.

Construction
-Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel.

This Laser Sight will work with virtually any railed pistol. The Viridian C5L Handgun Laser Sight lets you carry optimum visibility, maximum deterrence and total effectiveness into any situation. It may be the smallest laser sight / tactical light combo ever built. The sub-compact laser scope fits handguns by Glock, Springfield XD, Walther, Beretta, Colt, FNH, SIG Sauer, and anything with a rail!

I thought I might use it but it’s ended up just gathering dust. It is a very secure safe which requires a combination and key for it to be opened, after you do the combination you then have to turn the key before it will unlock; cannot be unlocked with just the key. The safe is probably around 20 years old, safes were made way better back then so don’t say this safe is worth less than new ones; do a youtube search of people breaking into new safes they just take a saw and cut through it in half. The label on the inside of the safe says “certified one hour test, this safe is guaranteed to withstand a fire of 1700 deg F within a period of one hour without damage to contents.  The safe’s dimensions are 16.5inches wide, 22.5 inches deep and 19 inches tall when measured from the outside and it probably a inch smaller measured from inside. It is a great safe and opens every time you put in the combo correctly and only takes a few attempts to get used to using a dial. If you would like to contact me please CALL or TEXT me at REDACTED, I won’t pick up if I’m busy but I always return calls. Thanks for looking and have a good day. For more pics search Iowa City craigslist for a fireproof safe."

Surplus ammo has all but dried up and due to recent import embargos signed in Sept 2012 and may never be imported again i.e. Chinese ammo.
This stuff is the best fodder for you AK74 type rifles or your AR with a 5.45 upper.  It is mildly corrosive but who cares because you cant find non-corosive anymore anywhere for under .60 a round.

Stainless steel construction offers the benefits of easier cleaning and greater corrosion resistance. For Semi-auto AR-15's only, will not work for M-16's.  Note: Rimfire conversion kits are NOT compatible with gas piston equipped AR-15's. The piston will not allow conversion to fit in the receiver.

Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is available in 9 mm Luger or .40 S&W calibers."

He sells them for $225 apiece, but I am only looking for $150 for mine.

The bump fire stock allows the shooter to safely and effectively bump fire his AK pattern rifle while it's shouldered, allowing him or her to actually aim and not have to hold it in an awkward position. The stock is affixed to the tang but cut so that it moves back and forth with a tab for the trigger finger so the recoil of the gun works the trigger. These are 100% legal and their AR-15 (branded Slide Fire) counterparts come with a letter from the ATF saying as much, since each shot is still an individual pull of the trigger!

An AR-15, or the so-called ""Assault Weapon"", was not used in the school shooting. The shooter even tried weeks earlier to buy a ri...fle but was turned down in the background check. So he had to kill his Mother to steal her rifle. There were initial reports, right after the shooting, that police found the AR-15 in his car, NOT IN THE SCHOOL. The rifle was not used. The shooter went into the school with 4 handguns, NOT an Assault Rifle as the media has charged. I remember in the initial hours of this shooting, the Police said they found the rifle in the car. But the Administration-controlled MSM had a pre-planned attack already waiting, to ban so-called assault weapons and jumped on that line of reporting, knowing it was a lie, which included people like Piers Morgan who said the shooter used an AR-15 that shoots hundreds of rounds per minute, as if it were a machine gun. Could it be that the Democrat Liberals and THEIR MEDIA were pushing for the new law, hoping they could do it, before the Coroner released the info? Absolutely.

It was made between 1884 and 1888. It is in very nice shape for being 120+ years old. it has 30.75 inch damascus steel barrels. All components are original matching numbers. These guns are rare and very collectable. Baker was one of the high end gun makers back in the day when LC Smith bought them out in 1888. LC Smith was then bought out by Marlin in the 1940s. This gun comes with a note from Ahlman's gunsmith varifying that it is still in fine working order and safe to shoot with light blackpowder loads (comes with the note from ahlmans themselves for proof).

These are US Military surplus rounds manufactured at the Lake City Munitions Plant in 1980 (Headstamp LC-80) and stored in sealed ammo cans. The M196 tracer cartridge (55-grain bullet) is a training round for 5.56mm NATO weapons. It has a red tip and is designed to trace out to 500 yards. This ammo is not reloaded and has never been used, but tracer elements do expire over time, and I cannot guarantee the tracing effects of these rounds. However, the ballistics are not affected and these are great 5.56 rounds for your AR 15.

The package comes with two (2) shoulder strap bandoliers loaded with 7 boxes in pouches. Each box contains two (2) stripper clips with 10 rounds each for a total of 280 rounds.

These are a great alternative to high priced AR 15 ammo."
