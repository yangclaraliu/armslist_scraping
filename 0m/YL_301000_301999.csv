PLEASE do not hesitate to throw out an offer, just tell me what you've got, its approximate condition, and throw out a rough number and we can go from there.  My mother is insisting on living alone out in the country, a bad part of the country with tons of thieves and meth-heads.  Naturally this worries me as I cannot be there for her, so being as I have a (humble) military background I am teaching her firearms safety and proficiency, and plan on buying her one (your Kel-Tec).  She is surprisingly all for this.  I enjoy handguns, but do not feel it to be the best choice for this application, and would give her one of my AR's but they are too heavy for her to hold in a proper fighting stance.

SOOO, long story short, shoot me an offer!  Have a wonderful day!"

I do not have a magazine though, it was lost in a move.  

This AK was made as a preban but was caught in customs when the ban went into effect in 1989.  So the markings had to be removed.

I would consider trades for USGI stuff, or WWII German and Japanese items as well.

It is a shoulder-fired, gas-operated,piston driven, semi automatic assault rifle that feeds from a 20 or 30 round AR magazine and is chambered for .223. The K2 replaced the M16A1 rifle in South Korean military use[3] in 1984.[4] The K2 formally entered South Korean military service in 1987.  The operating system utilizes a piston driven upper that has a rotating locking bolt like the AR-15.  I.E. it has an AK-47 like gas system and an AR type bolt giving it the best of both worlds.

It is an older pistol, I believe it may be a predecessor to the Rossi Model 68.  The Rossi Model 68's were made in Brazil and imported by Interarms, where as this is branded by the Garcia Corporation.  I'm not a historian so I don't really know any more about this model.  One interesting thing is the serial number is on the bottom of the grip, instead of on the side like the 1980's era Rossis.  

There is a moderate amount of wear but that is to be expected on an older revolver such as this one.  In my opinion the worn steel gives this gun added ""character"".  The internals are great.  Action is tight, and timing is like clockwork.  Patterns nicely for a small revolver like this one.

This gun is really fun to shoot.

  This would make a great truck gun or something to toss in the tackle box, or for home defense on a budget.  Price is somewhat negotiable, send me an offer and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

The P220 features a stainless steel slide machined from barstock and coated with a durable, wear-resistant Nitron finish, light-weight alloy frame with integral accessory rail, and the SIG SAUER four-point safety system of decocking lever, patented automatic firing pin safety block, safety intercept notch, and trigger bar disconnector.

I do not have a magazine though, it was lost in a move.  

This AK was made as a preban but was caught in customs when the ban went into effect in 1989.  So the markings had to be removed so it could be legally sold.  Only one batch of rifles were done this way.  So if you collect AK's, this is a rare one.

I would consider trades for USGI stuff, or WWII German and Japanese items as well.

These were developed for government security professionals. Here are the specs:

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

Model: 809B	 	Finish: Black Tennifer	 	Status: Available	 
Caliber: 9 mm	 	Grips: Checkered Polymer	 	UPC: 7-25327-60454-4	 
Capacity: 17 +1	 	Weight: 30.2 oz	 	Barrel Length: 4""	 
Frame: Medium	 	Action: SA/DA	 	Length: 8.25""	 
Trigger Type: Smooth	 	Order #: 1-809041	

I love this gun. Put 50 rounds through it an never a misfire and cycled flawlessly right out of the box. I have ms and can't pull the trigger very well with my right hand (dominant). I would be interested in trading for a single action 9mm ie. hk, glock, ruger of equal value. Could add a bit of cash for the right gun. Otherwise I want $385 for it (no background check or sales tax). 

Please don't offer me $300 cash or whatever. I know how much this gun is worth and i don't have to sell it. Just looking for other options. If i don't get $385 or trade for another pistol I will keep it. Mike"
