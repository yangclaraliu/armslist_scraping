I have a less than 2 yr old Ruger Mini 30 7.62X39mm Semi Auto rifle up for sale or trade for a nice handgun at least 10mm or .40 cal or bigger PLUS $200 to $400 in cash will get you this beautiful rifle that has had less than 100 rounds put through her, a hard plastic case for the Ruger, a 10 rnd magazine, a 5 rnd magazine, and a case of almost 1000 rounds of ammo for it.   The rifle is a no frills wooden stocked beauty.  No scratches, dings, skuffs or anything.  No sling comes with this rifle. You will need to get your own along with a scope and mounts for it.  This is more accurate than the AK47 out to 400 then 600 yards.  At 400 has about the same kinetic energy as the AK47.  And the ruger only has aboutan 8 pound recoil making it a lot easier to fire repeatedly than the AK.

I am looking to downsize my home protectin and the rifle is just too big for the wife to safely defend herself so I would like to get a 10mm, a .40 cal or bigger handgun for us to use.  I also need the cash so will take no less than $700 cash firm with no handgun.  Do not waste my time trying to offer less.  If you have a nice .40, .45, or even a 10mm and some high capacity magazines, I will trade you the ruger for it plus between $200 and $400 depending on the handgun you offer.

Heck, the ammo alone is worth over $200."

I bought the gun new this past October and used it for 2 range sessions with less than 250 rounds total run through the gun and it was cleaned and oiled after each session. Gun has great accuracy, nice trigger pull and no failure to fires or ejection issues during the two range sessions I have shot it back in October. I just decided I want the 9 mm version instead because of the cheaper ammo.

It is in excellent condition with less than 500 rounds thru it. It has Eliason windage and elevation adjustable rear sights, 5"" barrel, and a adjustable trigger stop. 
The only modification that has been done to it is the addition of a LaserMax Guide Rod Laser. The original guide rod and spring is included to make it 100% original from the factory if you want. It comes with 5 magazines, 3 Colts and 2 Wilson Combats. As stated earlier it comes with a LaserMax guide rod laser that I added in 2009. It also comes with a Bianchi Model 82 CarryLok tan leather hip holster. The gun has no holster wear, when I took my CCW class the instructor required a holster to take the class, it was the only day it was ever holstered. The original paperwork and boxes are included for the pistol, Laser Max, and holster, (reference the picture). Asking $1,200 for everything. The only partial trades I am interested in is a new LRB M25 receiver, good condition USGI M14 parts, or a .44 mag snub nose revolver. Also must be a FTF sale, I'm located in East Central Ohio but will travel a reasonable distance to meet.

RARE in .30-30 this gun is almost ALWAYS in .357, .44, or .45 colt, this one is NOT it is .30-30 and a wonderful pack gun. Here is the history of the gun, my son wanted to be like Dad, and so I bought him this because my Dad bought me my first .30-30. and when it came time to ""kill Bambi""  well... he just couldn't so I did, and he cried like hell. It broke my heart, but he grew up, moved on and here I still have the rifle, photos are included. It is NOT FACTORY NEW, hell I am not factory new, but this is darn near it! I looked up the value of these. no no no, not the internet lookups, I have 3 dealers in town that I use exclusively, and the books they use, the ONLY ones that dealers will approve of. This gun in this condition goes for $775+ average is about $650.00 so I am not out of line here, mine is in wonderful shape! better than average WAY WAY better. I AM OPEN TO OFFERS, not desperate, but guys no low balls here please. I wish you all the very best, may God bless you! I am looking to sell this not have you just look at it.

It is an incredible deal at $450 (FIRM)!

I would also consider trading for a single stack Sig Sauer 9mm.


I am the original owner and the gun is only about 6 months old. It is great condition and has never had any problems.  The only thing I have added are the stick on traction grips on the handle and they are easily removed if need be. I am going to all 9mm's for cost efficiency reasons.

I am the original owner and shot less than 100 rounds through it. It comes with the box, cleaning kit still in package, and Tapco 20 round magazine. I changed out the grip to a Tapco SAW type grip and added a Midwest Industries AK rail for the purpose of 922r compliance, but I still have the original parts and it's an easy swap. 

This gun doesn't have any cant in the sight or gas block that and has never had a FTF or FTE. It shoots well with little muzzle rise (the brake works really well) and is surprisingly accurate. The folding stock is tight. There are a few scratches where the stock folds up on the back of the rear trunnion, but otherwise no scratches. Basically it's new.

Check out the videos on YouTube of the power of the Taurus Judge..For home protection..or Truck protection if you work over the road.. its in a class of its own.Heres a example..  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttFslPwNEuc

This is a early production double/single action revolver that has matching numbers featuring a german silver half moon fixed front sight, a v-notched fixed rear sight and early checkered rosewood wooden grips having a serial number of 23XXX that makes it manufactured in 1880 according to proofhouse.com. Has the markings of ""COLT'S PT FA MFG CO"" ""HARTFORD CT USA"" in two seperate lines on the top of the barrel, the markings ""COLT DA 41"" with a etched panel denoting the caliber instead of the later type roll die on the left side of the barrel, the markings ""P3"" on the underside of the barrel near the frame, the markings ""PAT SEPT 18, 1871"" ""PAT SEPT 15 1874"" ""PAT JAN 19 1876"" in three seperate lines on the left side of the frame below the cylinder, the markings ""41 CAL"" on the left side trigger guard bow indicating a early type black powder trigger guard assembly, the matching serial number ""23XXX"" are on the bottom side of the frame in front of the trigger guard, on the front of the trigger guard frame and the bottom front of the butt and the assembly number ""401"" on the inside of the loading gate and bottom inside of the trigger guard. This revolver mechanics works fine in both single and double action locking up tight being in good cosmetic condition with the finish being thin in areas that has turned to a good honest aged patina color (as I am no expert in the grading of these just going on my opinion that defers from person to person) with the metal surface having normal handling marks and finish loss, the bore and cylinder chambers are in good condition having minor scattered darkening areas with good lands, grooves and good rifling the entire length of the bore. The checkered rosewood grips are in good condition with normal handling marks with no visual breaks, cracks or repairs, but please see pics and ask questions if there is something we have not covered as we are not experts in these type of firearms. This would make a great addition to your colt revolver collection to keep in your gun safe as the .41 cal thunderer's are becoming rare in the short barrel configuration, sometimes called the storekeeper or sheriff’s model. Will drive to meet a reasonable distance to sale or trade this item to Missouri Residents FTF on a bill of sale or will ship upon receiving a clear payment and being this revolver is manufactured before 1899 this makes it a antique firearm with no ffl paperwork being required just a ink signed statement stating that you are twenty-one years of age and/or a copy of your drivers license for legal firearms transfer. Will trade towards Glock Pistols or Colt & S&W Revolvers. For more information please respond to this ad.

I do not have the original case or manual, I have always
had it in the soft pistol case that it was in when I bought it. 

FYI - I do see them both on ebay and elsewhere from time to time for
sale pretty darn cheap too when I get the wild hair to look (which
I have every now and then, lol), but it just has not ever been a
priority for me so I never did order them up.

That might be something to consider though as this is certainly a
collector quality example if you wanted to go that route.

The gun is in very good condition, it just hasn't been shot much at
all, and if you know these guns - it is really hard to find them in
this shape as they were a favorite of the law enforcement crowd in
the day, and so many were beat up in service.

Over the years I have collected my own lot of hardware, and now
days I have kids around the house and just don't have the room in
my safe for it anymore, I am torn over it, I really do hate to see
it go!

-------------------

The Px4 Inox brings a fresh look and unique style to the Px4 family. Starting from a solid bar of stainless steel, the slide is bead blasted to a smooth satin finish, ensuring a non-reflective surface that is highly resistant to the elements. Mated to the highly refined, techno-polymer reinforced fiberglass frame, the Px4 Inox is optimized for use in the most challenging environments.Together they create a two-tone finish that is not only practical and functional, but distinctly attractive.These features make the Px4 Inox perfectly suited to humid climates or harsh environments.The Inox continues to maintain the proven features of the Px4 line of pistols.The three interchangeable backstraps make fitting most shooters with different sized hands quick and easy.The magazine release is easily changed to accommodate both right- or left-handed shooters, and the unparalleled reliability of the in-line feeding system keeps the Inox running shot after shot.The Px4 Inox epitomizes functional elegance for the most demanding shooter.

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 

The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense."

It comes with orignal holster and 3 half-moon speed loaders, as seen in pictures. Both holseter and gun in 90-95% condition. With World War I looming and a subsequent shortage of M1911 pistols apparent, S&W and Springfield Armory began a joint project to develop a “half-moon” steel clip for the large-frame Second Model that would hold three of the rimless .45 ACP cartridges, thus enabling them to be engaged by the extractor. As a fail-safe, S&W “step” machined the cylinder chambers to maintain proper headspace on the case mouths, enabling .45 ACPs to be fired without the clips, although cases would have to be removed individually. The U.S. declared war against Germany on April 2, 1917, and S&W’s Second Model in .45 ACP became what the factory workers called “The Government Model.” This series began with serial number 1, and by the end of the war 163,476 Model 1917s had been produced. The first guns were shipped on Sept. 6, 1917. They sported 5 1/2-inch barrels, polished blued finish, casehardened hammers and triggers, fixed sights, and two-piece smooth walnut stocks with lanyard rings attached to the butts. After Sept. 13, 1918, S&W factory production came under the auspices of Springfield Armory, and most guns were shipped to Springfield Armory or army depots. Because of their association with World War I and their reissue during World War II, Model 1917s hold their value, especially when in above-average condition. This 90 percent gun would BE both a shooter and a military collectable. This gun was made between 1917 and 1919 and the serial number is 92017"

I would prefer to deal with a private-party buyer in Washington State but that is just a preference and not necessarily an absolute.


PLEASE NOTE: The pricing has been reduced drastically due to the fact that it was discovered that the barrel AND cylinder had been changed out from the original 45 Colt to the current 38-40 sometime between 1886 and 1890. I quite simply cannot claim that the revolver is all original now and based on that, I guess I would have to call my Colt a shooter now!

I bought this a few months ago.  I am not a hunter.  I fired exactly 30 rounds through it, just enough to zero a scope.  

Price includes Bushmaster complete upper with charging handle and bolt carrier group, all matched.  All you need is a complete lower and you're ready to go.  I may have a stripped lower available at additional cost if you're looking to build one.

Cut/pasted from Bushmaster:

This Assembly - from our very accurate Varminter - features a 24"" Fluted Extra Heavy Barrel in 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber with 11 degree competition crown; heavyweight 1"" diameter under the handguard; custom match hybrid chamber with a tighter SAAMI Spec headspace from the shoulder of the chamber to the bolt face, and longer chamber throat or ""Leade"". This accommodates 5.56mm ammunition without developing higher pressures encountered when firing 5.56mm ammo in a .223 chamber with shorter ""Leade"" (both calibers can be used safely). Rifling is 1 in 9"" twist for optimum performance with most lighter bullet weight varmint cartridges, and the barrel is fluted to increase cooling and reduce weight. The Varminter Upper's shell ejection path has been modified to drop all your brass in the same place as a convenience for the reloader. A vented forend with bipod/sling stud installed, free-floats the barrel from the barrel nut forward and B.M.A.S.

This is not a safe queen but it's not a piece of junk either.  Gun has a little holster wear on the end of the barrel which is common for an older blued gun but it still has a lot of luster everywhere else (notice my hand reflection below the cylinder). Very minor wear ring on the cylinder which indicates the gun was carried but not shot much.  Fine sturdy heavy framed 357 for personal protection."
