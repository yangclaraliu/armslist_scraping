0,http://www.armslist.com/posts/165000,For Sale:  Magtech .380 Auto ACP Ammo - I have over 3000 rounds to sell...,"NW Fort Wayne, Fort Wayne, Indiana",$ 225,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 20, 2011",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is 3000 rounds of .380 ammo! I have 2000 rounds of Magtech .380 ammo packaged in 30 cal plastic sealed ammo cans. 1000 rounds fit nicely in each plastic ammo can. The plastic ammo can with 1000 rounds of .380 in it weighs about 25 pounds.












This stuff was originally packaged in Magtech's ""Shootin Size"" bulk packages without the nice plastic dividers of typical ammo boxes, that's why I have them in these ammo cans. Originally came like this:









The cheapest I can find Magtech .380 online right now is for $249.99 for 1000 rounds from here:

Don't forget to add in the cost of shipping on top of that, I added the ammo to the shopping cart and started the checkout process and it said shipping was $30.94...




I am asking $225 per 1000 rounds


I also have 1000 rounds of Prvi Partizan .380 ammo that is for sale, so 3000 rounds total (2000 Magtech and 1000 Prvi Partizan). I want to sell the Magtech first, so this listing is for the Magtech. You will be getting the ammo can with the ammo of course, I think I paid $15 a piece for these sealed plastic ammo cans. I am in Fort Wayne, no trades wanted, just cash. I sold my P3AT and no longer have a .380 gun... 
I understand there is some ""trust"" involved in buying ammo like this, if you want, I would be happy to count the ammo out with you so you know what you are getting!

Just to be honest and up front, these are cheaper from the factory.  There is however about an 8 to 10 month wait (that is after tons of written and verbal correspondence), not the 4 to 6 weeks that they claim.

Round count is approx: Less than 1000

Looking to trade this for a handgun more suitable to my tastes ( I don't much care for .40's) A few ideas are listed below, but feel free to offer anything you think might appeal to me (even a .40cal if it is a GREAT deal)



Some ideas  on trades

Glock 30SF

Sigs - Metal frame preferred - 9mm,45, will consider other calibers

XD9sc w/similar setup or + cash (or gun for gun, can switch the package around as neeed)

H&K USP COMPACT 9mm or 45 - Stainless is preferred

1911's - 45acp only

Possibly a nice .308 rifle





I will add more trade interests as I think about it, and I am willing to switch the package around accordingly to make a deal work. I may consider selling JUST the ammo at some point but not at this time. (Although I may trade it for 9mm or 45acp rounds)

FTF W/ ID AND BILL OF SALE REQUIRED!!! NO EXCEPTIONS FOR ANY REASON FOR ANY ONE!!! (It doesn't matter if your a cop in uniform, no ID, no sale smile 


Not looking to travel a great distance but for the right deal I  will. I would be willing to meet half way (roughly) within reason for just about any deal (sorry life is hectic and it is hard to get away right now)

Price is firm, All laws apply, face to face only, must have id's, no haggling, I don't care who has it cheaper, no bullshit.  

Everything is as stated and the price is there. Thanks for looking.

Cash price is $475 for everything, No less, you pick it up in Waynesboro,VA. The ONLY way I will travel at this price is for a nice trade."

4X-12X - 42mm  
Burris #200112

No more guessing yardage or fumbling with a shaky handheld rangefinder. No more losing sight of your trophy. No more guessing holdover. The Eliminator knows the precise horizontal distance to your trophy and exactly what your cartridge will do.  

Eliminator shows a 1/3 MOA illuminated aiming dot showing exactly where your shot will hit.

IN A SPLIT SECOND, JUST RANGE, AIM, AND FIRE.

This 4X-12X laser rifle scope gets you the range and, in the same millisecond, figures out how much holdover you need and illuminates one of a series of vertical 1/3 MOA dots. You put the dot where you want the bullet to go and pull the trigger. No brain required.

The Eliminator is 13 inches long, weighs 26 ounces with battery installed, and mounts low on a Picatinny or Weaver rail. Other mounting options are available from Burris. It comes with a remote control switch pad that you can use if you want, but it works just great using the main button. It ranges to 800 yards on a reflective target and to 550 on something with fur. You can program it to work with more than 600 rifle cartridge/load combinations, and Burris is working on software for black powder and handguns. 

Includes: threaded sun shade, mounting hardware, installation tool,  instruction sheet, cartridge sheet, cleaning/storage cloth, factory lens cap set, remote trigger pad w/battery, new main battery installed + 5 extra.

I bought this scope brand new from OpticsPlanet 6 months ago. It's not a demo or refurb. It's in like new condition, very minor mounting marks on base, can’t be seen when mounted. Have several more photos, will email them if you want. In original packaging with all original items/papers. It was mounted on my AR-15 flat top and zeroed, then removed because the rifle was sold.

It's been handled with care, never dropped, wet, or otherwise abused. You won't be disappointed. Money back if not satisfied.

This one is a Remington model 81 semi-automatic.  It is the 300 savage caliber model made probably near 1947.  These guns were used by the police for a while and a lot of deer have been killed with them.  The 300 savage is a good mid-range caliber for most woods hunting.

It has a side mounted scope which is mounted properly so it doesn't interfere with the shell ejection.  You can easily drop down to the ""iron sights"".  Very handy when you bump the scope in the field and don't know if you knocked it out of sight.  That feature saved me from losing a deer one year on my Win Model 94 when my son bumped it off the tailgate of the truck.  When we sighted it in a few days later it was off by about 3 feet at 100 yards.  Good thing I used the iron sights to drop my buck that year!!!

I have put about 400 rounds through the gun so far and have only used the laser itself a handful of times. 

It has been barely used, no scratches on it, and battery life is full. 

My Observations:

The grip itself is comparable to the -Large- back strap that comes with the gun itself.  If you have small hands, and use the small back strap, then the crimson trace might not be for you. I have smaller hands, and personally, I feel the difference between the small and large back strap changes the dynamics of my grip enough that I would prefer to forgo the laser grip and just use the small back strap.

That is why I am selling it, so keep what I said about your hand size in mind before you decide to buy. I don't want anyone to be surprised with what they are buying.

As far as the C  Trace grip itself, it is for a M&P -COMPACT- models only. 9mm, .357 , or .40. It also does not fit the models with ambidextrous safety.

The MSRP on crimsontrace.com is 329. With a quick google search I found cheapest on Amazon  and some other online sites was about 285-295 without shipping.

I'm asking 225, because it has barely been used and I believe 225 is  more than fair price."

IMPROVED OUTER TACTICAL VEST 
COMPLETE WITH SOFT ARMOR & PLATES
DATED 12/2009, UNWORN, MEDIUM

This is the first of the Gen 2 Vests I have seen and these are few and far between. It shows No signs of ever being worn. 

Vest Includes:
•	Vest with all soft armor inserts and quick release system, 12/2009, Medium fits Chest 37-41
•	Front and Back Collars, 12/2009
•	Groin Protector and Lower Back Protector with inserts, 12/2009
•	Internal Waistband
•	Right and Left “Wing” assemblies, (MOLLE Waistband/Cumberbund)
•	Side Plate Carriers/Pouches
•	DAPS with inserts, Both dated 2007

If you held the Generation I & II vests side by side, it might be hard to tell the difference. For operators in the field, however, even a set of subtle changes can have far-reaching effects. 
The Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) incorporates new utility features and design enhancements which provide lightweight comfort and maximum protection. All of IOTV’s improvements result in a fully integrated vest that not only offers the most advanced protection available but greater maneuverability for mission effectiveness.

•	One change set involved expanding vertical adjustment of the side plate carriers, and allowing horizontal changes. This allows IOTV to properly fit a wider variety of soldier sizes, including women.
•	The Gen II design converted back to Cordura for mesh, because the previous material was so “aggressive” that it was damaging the uniform underneath. 
•	Streamlining the quick release cable handle to reduce pinch-points or friction, so it can weigh less and work better.
•	More than three pounds lighter than OTV
•	Lower back extender protects the lower spine region and increases the vest’s coverage by 52 square inches
•	Internal waistband enhances mobility by distributing the weight from the shoulders to the waist and helps stabilize the load
•	The other major Generation II change involves D-Ring attachments on the front, to make additional gear easier including a load-bearing system (Tactical Assault Panel, Not Included) that goes beyond MOLLE velcro’s holding capacity

PLATES INCLUDED
Ceradyne ESAPI, Type VI Level IV Plates
•	ESAPI Type VI Level IV Plates
•	Like New, Excellent Condition
•	Medium Size: Dimensions: 9.50""x12.5"" x.800” (241 x 318 x 20 mm) Weight: 6.27 lbs (2.41 kg)
•	Type IV
•	Certified 2009

 … The whole package needs to go …
I am asking $750 Cash for the complete set.
Trades Possible but has to be a really good trade
That includes the vest with all inserts and attachments. And the front and rear plates
First Person that emails me they want it …and It’s theirs. 
Look at others and check me. (dates, condition and if it’s a GenII)
$750 is a great price

any questions just ask.

These guns were reworked from M.1943 Mauser rifles, and this one is accordingly stamped on the receiver, ""Fabrica De Armas La Coruna 1955"". The receiver displays a slightly fading Spanish crest. FR-8 was used for practice by Spanish soldiers before they were issued CETME assault rifles. The rifle has a fake gas tube installed under the barrel, to make it look like the CETME rifle. This fake gas tube is actually a cleaning kit container (the cleaning kit is not included). This gun has stronger, 1898-type action than FR-7, which was build on 1893-type action. Straight bolt handle. Stock with pistol grip. The stock does not display any markings. All matching serial numbers (the matching serial numbers are stamped on the receiver, barrel and on the bolt only; all the remaining parts do not display any numbers, which is correct for this model). CONDITION: Excellent, as rebuilt by Spanish arsenal. Most of phosphate finish is still on metal. Very nice stock has been filled in one place. Excellent bore with strong and shiny rifling. Strong action. All the internal parts of the rifle are in excellent condition, with little visible wear. Mechanically, the rifle is in great condition."

This is an AK-47 type rifle. It's got a low round count, though it's been reliable and accurate in my time with it. It has the Tapco trigger, which takes care of the trigger slap problems.  It does have a bit of magazine wobble, but it's not enough to cause any concern, or endanger reliability.

I bought this gun in March of 2010.  I have put just under 1500 rounds through the gun without issue (500 steel cased FMJs, 500 brass cased JHPs, 500 brass cased FMJs).  The only modification currently on this gun is a Springer Precision Trigger Kit which reduces trigger travel by 50% and pull weight by 25%.  Excellent kit, makes for very fast followup shots.  Also included with this sale is the complete XDGear set including hard locking case, paddle holster, dual magazine holster, cleaning kit, chamber lock, and two 19 round magazines.  The gun is in 98% condition and has never required any repair or warranty work (Springfield Armory offers a lifetime warranty on ALL of their guns, even if transferred to another owner).  Only selling because I recently purchased a Springfield Armory Loaded 1911.

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380, a micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. 

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.
