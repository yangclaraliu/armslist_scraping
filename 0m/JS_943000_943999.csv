The 500AB is the 500A Mossberg shotgun with some upgrades...specifically a Walnut stock VS the various hardwood stocks found on the regular 500A model. This 500AB also has some metal etchings ,as seen in 1 photo, that the 500A doesnt have ...and it has a 30"" barrel. (Every part on this 500AB is interchangeable with the regular 500A)
This is a fixed full choke 30"" barreled shotgun. 30 inches is a long range shotgun. Perfect for Deer and Water Fowl...and predators of any nature. You get the 75-100 yard reach of a rifle, with the spread pattern of a shotgun.  Full choke means it keeps it's shot pattern tight over a long distance, so you get killing/stopping power at rifle like distances.  It shoots bird and buck shot...and rifled slugs. It is chambered for 2 and 3/4"" and 3.00"" shells.  It functions flawlessly and it looks good. The bore is beautiful inside...slick as a whistle.  It also has a metal safety switch, not a plastic one like the newer Mossbergs. It has a Tasco Red Dot scope, a good one, that enables quick sholdering and accurate firing of shotgun. For those folks who don't know what a Red Dot scope is: You turn the switch on and the red dot is displayed in the scope lens...when you look thru the scope, wherever the dot is - is where the bullet goes. If you move your head, the red dot stays on the target your pointing at and you can still see the dot as you move your head around. It makes for very quick and accurate shooting). I love this shotgun, and the new owner will too. I need money, I have to sell it. 300.00 is my negotiated price."

All of these rounds were shot either zeroing in a scope or developing loads. Cleaned and broken in right. I don't know how many pictures I can upload for the auction but if I can get them all on you will see two targets shot at 100 yards that are very impressive. This rifle will deliver superior accuracy with the  69 grain Sierras I was using. I bought the scope new also and it is perfect. The gun is in 99% condition. The trigger pull is one of the best factory triggers I have experienced on an AR and I have shot quite a few. My reason for selling is I wanted a piston driven gun and have one coming. I'm not interested in trades, just cash. I'm including three magazines. One 30 round metal, one 30 round SIG SAUER and a 20 round metal. the 20 round work well from the bench when you are sighting in a scope or developing loads. This scope is zeroed to print the groups you see in the picture so it is ready to go with those particular loads. IF you shoot something different then you will have to zero it for your ammo. I have the flip up rear sight for the gun. Feel free to ask questions. This is the Sport model that comes without forward assist and dust cover. I have additional pictures which can be emailed directly to you if you are interested."

Save big dollars while shooting for pennies!!! 

The Huldra Mark IV 5.45 Carbine’s patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder than hard chrome. 

The 5.45x39 caliber bullet matches high muzzle velocity with excellent sectional density, resulting in a flat trajectory and good penetration. The standard ball cartridge will penetrate 5mm of steel plate at a distance of 350 meters. The lowered recoil impulse of the 5.45mm cartridge (verses the 7.62x39mm) has a beneficial effect on accuracy. The 5.45x39mm cartridge is an excellent round that offers comparable penetration, accuracy and lethality to anything fielded by NATO. More importantly, 5.45x39 ammunition is less expensive to shoot! This rifle has been designed to handle dirty and corrosive surplus ammunition. The bolt and bolt carrier have been protected by an ion-bond finish. These processes make the parts corrosive resistant. Now you have the ability to shoot the inexpensive corrosive mil-surplus ammo without the fear of the parts being unduly worn. 

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical tooling dimensions held within ±.001"" and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control."

   These have 16.5"" chrome lined barrels. This rifle is original except the addition of a scope. It is a B Square mount that uses the rear pin, so no drilling or tapping was done. This rifle has a LOW round count through it. It was not a range hound. I've used it for hunting some. Shoots great and is accurate. Comes with a 30 round Magazine, one stripper clip and 20 to 30 rounds of ammo (whatever I have around here). It is not a rifle I shoot that much, so I never had much ammo on hand.

The 500AB is the 500A Mossberg shotgun with some upgrades...specifically a Walnut stock VS the various hardwood stocks found on the regular 500A model. This 500AB also has some metal etchings ,as seen in 1 photo, that the 500A doesnt have ...and it has a 30"" barrel. (Every part on this 500AB is interchangeable with the regular 500A)
This is a fixed full choke 30"" barreled shotgun. 30 inches is a long range shotgun. Perfect for Deer and Water Fowl...and predators of any nature. You get the 75-100 yard reach of a rifle, with the spread pattern of a shotgun. Full choke means it keeps it's shot pattern tight over a long distance, so you get killing/stopping power at rifle like distances. It functions flawlessly and it looks good. It isn't perfect in appearance, the blueing and the wood show some wear, but it looks good. The bore is beautiful inside...slick as a whistle. It also has a metal safety switch, not a plastic one like the newer Mossbergs. I love this shotgun, and the new owner will too. It has the weaver/picatinny scope mounts already on it. If you have a scope with weaver/picatinny rings, it will mount right up to the shotgun. I will trade this gun."

The bolt is highly polished steel not blued, another sign of a high quality firearm.  It is in great shape with only minor scuffs on the stock from hunting in the 80's...I am the second owner, my grandfather was the original purchaser in NY.  I can email pictures for a better look if desired.  This is a true collectors item.  Similar to Sako Forester of the same time period.  This not a ""salt"" cured stock, it is earlier.  No corrosion.

 TACTICAL PRECISION, For 2012, SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is the new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556 measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556 sets a new standard for dependable operation and function.

NOTE: Beware of fakes! The ‘Thunderer’ was designed in 1990 by Cimarron founder and president “Texas Jack” Harvey and is produced only by A. Uberti exclusively for Cimarron Firearms Co. To paraphrase the famed film director John Ford, ”If this isn’t the way the old west six guns were, it’s the way they should have been!’ Firearms buffs have often wondered why the single action was never produced in the 19th century with the grips of the double-action Thunderer ® revolvers. Now you can have the best of both worlds, in four handsome and practical barrel lengths. The compact 3 1/2-incher is a superb carry single-action. This mating of two popular frontier six-shooters has given birth to one of today’s most sought after single action wheel guns!” - Phil Spangenberger -

Specifications - Caliber: .357 Magnum / .38 Special; Barrel Length: 3 1/2 in.; Style: Thunderer ; Frame: Case Hardened; Finish: Standard Blue; Grip: 1 Piece Walnut Smooth; Weight 2.57 Lbs. 

Firearms Return Policy: VERY IMPORTANT - Please take your time to inspect all firearms thoroughly before proceeding with the firearms transfer process. Once a new firearm is transferred to you it is considered used, even if unfired. Consequently, we cannot provide a full refund for new firearms once they have been transferred into your possession. Also, we DO NOT reimburse FFL transfer fees on cancelled or refused firearms. We do understand that some manufacturer defects may not be identifiable upon initial inspection. However, upon discovering a defect after the transfer, the firearm must be returned directly to the manufacturer for replacement or repair (in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty policy). By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

NOTE: Beware of fakes! The ‘Thunderer’ was designed in 1990 by Cimarron founder and president “Texas Jack” Harvey and is produced only by A. Uberti exclusively for Cimarron Firearms Co. To paraphrase the famed film director John Ford, ”If this isn’t the way the old west six guns were, it’s the way they should have been!’ Firearms buffs have often wondered why the single action was never produced in the 19th century with the grips of the double-action Thunderer ® revolvers. Now you can have the best of both worlds, in four handsome and practical barrel lengths. The compact 3 1/2-incher is a superb carry single-action. This mating of two popular frontier six-shooters has given birth to one of today’s most sought after single action wheel guns!” - Phil Spangenberger -

Firearms Return Policy: VERY IMPORTANT - Please take your time to inspect all firearms thoroughly before proceeding with the firearms transfer process. Once a new firearm is transferred to you it is considered used, even if unfired. Consequently, we cannot provide a full refund for new firearms once they have been transferred into your possession. Also, we DO NOT reimburse FFL transfer fees on cancelled or refused firearms. We do understand that some manufacturer defects may not be identifiable upon initial inspection. However, upon discovering a defect after the transfer, the firearm must be returned directly to the manufacturer for replacement or repair (in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty policy). By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

Umarex H&K Heckler Koch MP5 A5 - 22lr
This is the first official Heckler & Koch MP5 chambered in .22 LR. Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5 is engineered as a dedicated .22 rim fire rifle. It's built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. They are proportionate in size to the center fire version's magazine to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine.

It's a DAO 19oz, 5-shot, all stainless, ""hammerless"" & +P rated Centennial J-frame. In excellent condition with a few handling marks here and there, nothing too major and absolutely no rust or pitting. The lockup and timing are perfect, as are the chambers and bore. 

This example was made in ~1992 during a time when S&W was known to really have their stuff together as far as materials and craftsmanship went. Guns made in the late 80's to the mid 90's, especially the Centennials (""hammerless"") are known by S&W guys for their smooth actions and precise fitting. This gun features a forged hammer and trigger and no MIM parts or Internal Lock.

The gun will come with the Spegel grips pictured - very popular in S&W circles. Sorry, no box or papers on this one. I'm only selling it to fund another gun and will pull this ad if the other one  becomes unavailable. It's a nice gun that I have no problem keeping. They're lightweight (for being all-stainless), durable, smooth handling and made back when S&W still cared about their guns.


I'm looking for a FTF deal in the Everett area and not looking for trades. Would like to see a CPL unless I've dealt with you before. I'm asking •$550• with the grips or •$500• without.Preference goes to whoever can meet closer/sooner. I apologize for the non-super-high-quality photos, but I don't have a card for my camera so my phone had to do :/ To reiterate, only really looking for a FTF deal as shipping costs are prohibitively high here. If you want the gun shipped, it can be, but it isn't cheap.

Thanks for looking.
-Rob

This is a fixed full choke 30"" barreled shotgun. 30 inches is a long range shotgun. Perfect for Deer and Water Fowl...and predators of any nature. You get the 75-100 yard reach of a rifle, with the spread pattern of a shotgun. Full choke means it keeps it's shot pattern tight over a long distance, so you get killing/stopping power at rifle like distances. It functions flawlessly and it looks good. It isn't perfect in appearance, the blueing and the wood show some wear, but it looks good. The bore is beautiful inside...slick as a whistle. It also has a metal safety switch, not a plastic one like the newer Mossbergs. I love this shotgun, and the new owner will too. It has the weaver/picatinny scope mounts already on it. If you have a scope with weaver/picatinny rings, it will mount right up to the shotgun. I will trade this gun."
