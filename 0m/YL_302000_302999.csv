2007 Hoyt Vectrix. Camo, with all the trimmings.

Comes with I think 7 or 8 carbon fiber arrows, 3 have broad heads. Has a wrist strap on the grip. This thing is truly bad! Also has a hard case. It is 60-70lb I think it has a 65-75% release on it. Very fast shooter. It's a 30 inch draw. I can send pics to anyone interested. 
So, I am looking for a hunting rifle. Prefer 300 win mag, 7mm, .308. Possibly a 30-06 if it is nice. Or a really nice .223. I'd possibly take a stainless mini 14, Possibly an AK. Not interested in any shotguns, or anything mossberg. Would consider pistol trades.. Throw me some offers. Just consider, just the bow alone is around $450. The release, the sights, the rest, case, all the work done for the peep... All adds up quick. This is a hunting machine! Not a cheapo! Please take that into consideration before you offer me a really cheap piece of junk....Put a link to a photo, but I have many more.

I do not have a magazine though, I did not receive any when I got it.

This AK was made as a preban but was caught in customs when the ban went into effect in 1989.  So the markings had to be removed so it could be legally sold.  Only one batch of rifles were done this way.  They removed the bayonet lug, and also the threads for the muzzle break and attached the muzzle break with an adaptor.   So if you collect AK's, this is a rare one.

My buddy was going to buy it, but he can't come up with the cash for a while.

Here is a link to AR15, where we were discussing what this AK is:

So these were made in violation fo the Tready and not dated, so they couldn't prove when they were made.

These would be for a wallhanger only.  They are not in very good shape, only useful if you just want to make something to hang up.  The barrel says on it belgium laminated steel, its rusty looking but could be cleaned up some for a conversation piece.  The stock has a couple small chips, might be able to be used.  These are for the 1890's early 1900's store brand shotguns that had the external hammers.  If you are interested let me know and I will send you some pics."

Is a Greek return, looks reparked, but not in Greek black.  Functions 100%.....only selling because I recently upgraded with an all HRA with a slightly better muzzle/throat.  This is as good or better than a lot of the recent Service Grades from the CMP.  I don't have a CMP cetificate on this one, but being a Greek return stock, almost has to be a CMP rifle.  I bought from a licensed FFL, they didn't have the certificate.  

Asking $700 (that is bottom line)  Please no more offers below $700......I can part it out for much more and still have a barrelled receiver when I'm done! .........  CMP SG's will run you close to that by the time you pay the taxes, shipping or gas up there!  Only trade options I currently will entertain would be a nice USGI M1 Carbine that isn't imported back.  It will have to be close to correct, USGI marked stock too.  I want one with a good muzzle too......not a shot out in need of rebarrel.  If you have any lopside trade options where you want to give me something worth way more just to have this really nice M1 Garand....then shoot it my way.  All I can do is say ""No Thanks""

The magazine tube holds 17, these are no longer available. it is the ""pre-ban"" model, not trying to make it sound like an AR, just letting you know what it is. i think the cap is now 13, but could be wrong on this; i do know that you can no longer get the 17 shot tube. Shoots straight and true. These are great little shooters, but I am way heavy on the long guns and I prefer 22 pistols for just plinking and fun.  it is the 60 with the checkered stock and the squirrel etched in the stock, not going to call it a collector’s item but you don’t see this model 60 very often; usually just a standard walnut stock. would make a great starter for a youngster wanting to get in to squirrel hunting or just getting involved in the sport of target shooting. Crown of barrel looks good and bluing is probably 85% +, but i am not a firearms appraiser. the riflings are impeccable and the bore is bright. the rifle does have some scuffs, but nothing major; i mention only because if you are looking for something brand new i want to let you know up front it has been used. let me know what you have for trade, all i can say is no, again though, I am looking to eliminate some long guns. pics will be up soon. email if interested, if you leave a number and do not want to be called after a certain time put that in the email, because i am up late. Willing to go 20, maybe 30 minutes from zip code 45102, for trade of interest possibly further. also willing to go  further for Military and law enforcement, wont go too far, as it is not an expensive item.

Here is the revolver of all revolvers (in my opinion!) for sale. This is a Colt Python in a blue finish in a .357 Magnum. Has a 6"" barrel with original wood grips. I DO NOT have manual or box. Gun does have holster wear on tip of barrel and cylinder. Left has side of gun does have minor rust spots. Also, the grips show signs of use as well. I would rate the gun to be between 80%-85% if I had to guess. I have taken the best pictures I can but with the gun being such a deep blue color, it’s kind of tough. $1,100.00.

Effortless, feather-light, everyday carry setup. The PF-9 is one of the smallest, most concealable 9mm handguns ever made. I've put about 1000 rounds through it, mostly 124gr Remmington UMC FMJ and 114gr Hornady Critical Defense. Well past the break-in point. The slide stop was replaced about a year ago. Excellent opperation with zero FTE over the last 500 rounds. Two options for spare mag carry.

Mossberg International’s new lightweight Tactical .22 combines the look and feel of today’s AR-style platforms with Mossberg International’s reliable and affordable .22 autoloader. Taking cues from the proven 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 18” barrel to a quad-rail forend, giving any shooter the opportunity to easily customize the Tactical .22 with lights, lasers or any number of AR accessories currently in the marketplace. The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13” length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4” – 14.5” LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights. Other features included with the Tactical .22 are sling mounts and a ten round magazine."

It is a much nicer offering than the ""plastic"" guns with the cheap woods found on the currently manufactured offerings by Ruger today.

Yes - I know you can go to Walmart and buy a brand new one for $217.00 plus tax but this is NOT the same gun! This is from the time when they were still made of domestic wood and metals. Not the cheap stuff they use today to cut manufacturing costs!

$250.00 firm on price. If you want one cheaper, buy one of the newer style made after 2007.
