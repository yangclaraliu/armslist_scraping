Seriously gang, this rifle is in excellent shape. You will be hard pressed to find a used AR in as good of shape as this one.

Glock 30 .45 ACP, Gen 3.

I bought this Glock new in 2006. It for certain has less than 500 rounds through it with 100% reliability as you'd expect. I have turned over a new leaf and the ""never sell a gun"" mentality has changed to ""sell/trade guns you don't shoot for something you will."" Great pistol, great carry gun.

I keep my guns in meticulous condition, you won't be disappointed with this one. You can tell from the pics this is a low round count gun. Gun is about as close to new as a fired gun can be, inside and out. Comes with (2) 10 round magazines and everything you get with a new Glock, box paperwork, etc.

This was not an easy decision, but while it is a fantastic rifle and an excellent SHTF weapon choice, I simply do not LIKE it enough.  I am not a soldier, and I want a gun I enjoy shooting, carrying, and looking at - and I've found that I am a huge fan of pistols and pistol-caliber carbines.  So, I'm selling this to have some extra funds to look at other options - I'll probably just get another Cx4, I absolutely loved that gun while I had it.  On the upside, this is not money that might be needed for my upcoming move - I am selling this gun for the sole purpose of BUYING guns.  Should be fun.

This rifle is in excellent condition, and works flawlessly.  It has a 20"" barrel unmodified from when it was imported (still has the silver-soldered false flash hider).  It has OEM handguards, a Stormwerkz super-low top rail for mounting optics, a side-folding stock and a Troy Battle-Ax CQB grip.  This grip is awesome, it looks short but with the receiver attachment it ends up being about the same length as an A2 grip but much more comfy.  One thing of note, the rifle loves green-follower mags.  It will work fine with any AR magazine, but I have found that the green-followers are easy to load on a closed bolt with a full 30-round load, whereas tan follower mags and PMags are a bit stiff on a closed bolt (when I had PMags I left them one round short).  All mags I've tested will load and function fine, I just went with these because they worked so well in that specific use case.

This will be sold ONLY as a package, including the weapon, an A2 grip so you have options, four GI green-follower mags loaded with 55gr. FMJ ammo (I also added a paracord loop on the floorplates of these ones), a Beta C-Mag loaded with 100 rounds of 55gr. FMJ ammo (complete with pouch and lube), and a ""fat-fiddy"" ammo can loaded up with 18 GI green-follower mags (all empty).

The rifle will not include the Izzy sling, I'm hanging onto that to stick on whatever I settle on for my personal rifle/carbine/PDW choice.  Go buy one though, they're really nice slings if you just want something functional without too many bells and whistles.

$1400 or best offer (seriously...send me offers), only trade I'll look at will involve a Beretta Cx4 carbine in 9x19mm OR a FN PS90 with the USG optic (preferably the OD stock), OR a Colt Anaconda with a 6"" barrel.  I am not looking at anything else right now while I think about my options.

For sale, a Charles Daly semi auto field hunter 12 gauge ultra mag, shoots 2 3/4"" - 3 1/2"". Gun is in Realtree Advantage Max 4 camo pattern, has a 28"" barrel. Gun is in great condition, haven't had any issues, just want to get a new gun. Bought it about one year ago. I've killed many ducks and geese with it, so I know it works, and holds up well in harsh weather conditions. The gun is priced at around $500 brand new, I'll take $425 since I've only had it for less than a year. I will consider other offers and trades as long as they aren't completely ridiculous and insulting. Contact me at REDACTED if you're interested or you have any questions."

She is topped off with Leupold bases and rings but I couldn't tell you what kind of scope I have on her right now.  I picked the scope up for cheap from a friend, all I know is that it really does get the job done (my plan was to eventually replace it with a Leupold MK4 when I had the cash).  Anyway, I pretty much just finished the barrel break in on this one and she is a real tack driver.  My break in procedure went as followes: 3 single shots with a cool down period and cleaning between each, then 4 - 3 shot groups with a cool and clean between each group, then I end with a 5 shot group for a total of 20 rounds.  That's all I've shot out of her yet.  I didn't measure any of the groups because I was starting to play around with loadings but I can tell you that this rifle does love 168gr Sierra Match boat tail bullets.  She shoots super tight with them.  The bi-pod isn't included in the rifle sale as it will be put on my next purchase (from the list above) when I get the cash.  Not to worry, there are bipods all over for cheap now.  Hopefully I'll hear from you soon, lets make a deal!"

The CompM4 is the finest sight that Aimpoint has ever produced. Improvements include improved energy efficiency that provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery! The CompM4 incorporates an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring, and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of weapon systems. The CompM4 can also be used by hunters and sport shooters that need night vision compatibility.





Compatible with every generation of Night Vision Devices (NVD) 
Super ACET technology allows up to 80,000 hours (over 8 years) of daytime operation on one AA battery 
Internal voltage regulator allows the CompM4 to be used with any AA size battery.
 Seven night vision compatible settings and 9 daylight settingsr

The specs are available on the net. I had a Badger Ordnance bolt knob professionally installed by a gunsmith. It has about 200 rounds through it and the bbl was broken in for the first 100 rds (5 rds, cleaned until 50, then every 10 rds). The fore end has a pic rail installed for the quick release bipod or sling attachment. Bipod is a Harris with tile and a pod-lock handle.

This is a very accurate rifle with Federal match 168 and shoots better than the 3/4"" group shown below (100 yds). With a little practice, I now have a 100yd card with three holes touching, so this gun will do it.

The optic is a Premier Reticicles Heritage 3-15 power, with the Gen II mil dot with a single turn elevation knob and variable power illuminated reticle. This is one of the top of the line scopes and is made for very long distance shooting. Here is the website for specs: http://www.premierreticles.com/products/

This scope is one of the scopes currently under contract to Marines, Army, and SOF for sniper and DMR weapons.

You can check out reviews at SWFA or any of the other sites that sell high-end optics. SCOPE lists for $2880 on most sites.

The scope is mounted with a Badger Ordnance 0 degree rail and Badger Ordnance low rings. Factory and aftermarket caps are included.

I'll include a mil-dot instruction book and ballistic cards for the Federal 168gr match round, and 500 rounds of match ammo.

The case is an Eagle Industries drag bag without the shroud on the end.

This is a very well set up gun and does 1/4""MOA without further mods if you do your part; it shoots better than I do.

Trades considered for Colt or SIG high-end 1911, SIG 229 or 220, or Rolex submariner, GMT or Explorer.  

Several of you have asked about the gun w/o optic. Gun, case, bone, and ammo are 1600. or I'll go 1400 without the ammo; I keep the scope and rings. You'll be wishing you bought the scope though!

These have been selling for 2.5k to 3.3 k on gunbroker as individual pieces. Very few matched sets still exist.

I have a nice stripped Camillus BK-9 with custom micarta handles, as well as the original grivory ones, that I would like to trade for another large fixed blade knife.  
It's a user with a few small dings on the spine from improper batoning with something hard (I think) that were there when I got it myself.  I have kept it sharpened with a Razor Sharp System and it will easily shave you.
I'm a big fan of Camillus brand Beckers and would be most interested in a BK4 Machax, BK6 patrol machete or BK77 Extreme but will consider other high end fixed blades.
Let me know what you have to trade and I will send pics and let you know if I am interested.

Its a 1938 Izhevsk M91/30 round receiver in over all good condition, all matching serials, good bore shiny lands with old hard cosmoline baked in grooves, wood is in excellent condition metal is probably 90 to 95%.
This gun shoots very well, no bolt cycling problems like on some, its as smooth as butter, and the trigger is crisp, probably one of the best triggers I have seen on these guns!
I got this from another gent that bought it in cosmoline, he took it straight to a shooting range without cleaning out the cosmoline first, so it will take some scrubbing to get that out of there.
