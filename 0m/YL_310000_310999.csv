The gun was manufactured in 1980 and has no scratches or wear on the finish, which is a perfect mirrored blue, even after 32 years! It appears to have seen very little firing in its lifetime, because the only wear I can find anywhere is on the breech face, and that is minimal. 

This also comes with its original box, original magazine, and original instruction manual. This gun will make somebody a great racing pistol!"

Colt Woodsman Match Target 3rd Issue, .22lr, 6 inch heavy slab sided  barrel,, Beautiful walnut grips w/thumb rest,  one correct mag, no box, gun is 95%  ((Serial Number 178xxx-s    produced in1957)) has appropriate roll marks including “match target” engraved in barrel. Very good condition , shoots amazing groups, cycles quick and smooth for fast follow up shots. Have some papers that show how to take this apart and service it and parts breakdown ( not original) this gun has not been shot much , but does function perfectly and is in great shape for being so old.   
Woodsman “Match Target” Pistols were designed for competition, bull’s-eye shooting…This Colt has features that make this pistol rare and more collectible than base models. For example, the full length lugged “slab sided” match grade barrel. This adds balance to the entire frame of the pistol and that translates into a less fatiguing grip. It does add weight to the overall gun, but the additional weight absorbs any recoil and keeps your sights on target.  The factory installed adjustable sights- standard front blade, rear notch configuration.
may accept a mostly cash and partial trade ( be realisitic ) I do not need to sell this , but I have some other firearms interests in more modern stuff"

Production Sample - Prototype
AW-CAM1A

Designed for the 21st Century by Bob Terzuola, the Camillus 1A1 Bayonet was designed as the Camillus Cutlery entry for the XM8/Army/Marine Corp Bayonet upgrade project.

This bayonet meets all of the US Government specifications & design requirements, and then some.

The handle is dual overmolded polymer with a soft texture and multiple gripping surfaces. It is comfortable in both forward and reverse grips. The color is Coyote Brown with Loam Green grip panels on each side. An index finger notch has been incorporated for additional grip security in wet or slippery situations.

The blade measures 7.375"" and is made from the super rugged Camillus 0170-6C carbon steel. lt features a near full length double edge, with 2"" of serrations for extra cutting power on the primary edge. The double edge allows the weilder to cut in both directions while in combat, unlike the current single edge of the M9 bayonet.

The sheath is just as remarkable; featuring the same duo molded technology and a noise reduction panel on the front. Reversable for right or left hand use, the sheath also features a built in sharpening hone for field maintenance of the knife's cutting edge. The polymer sheath also houses the removable wire cutters with two different types of cutters, one sheer type cuts razor ribbon, the other cuts chain-link or barbed wire, and it has a spade type screw driver on the end. A quick release Bianchi clip attaches the sheath to standard military web belts, and the entire system can quickly be detached using the integral side release buckle.

The 1A1 XM8 Bayonet will fit all current standard US Military bayonet mounting hardware.

General Specifications

This Item/set-up was taken out of my Chevy Suburban to make room for a 100lbs+ dog. In Full working order with exception of a 12vdc neon tube inside the enclosure (can be replaced with ease and minimal cost). Also including remote Bass Boost module for the amp (lighted knob kind), - you will need a double mono 1/8 end cable to plug it in . As you see, there was no expense spared on this stereo (everything was purchased BRAND NEW), Amp was $800 shipped, Enclosure was $750+$150 shipping due to size/weight and capacitor was $200. So, not including all the terminals and wires, spare fuse and Bass Boost module This set-up was $1900. As you see from the pics, there are over $120 in wires and high end voltage distribution hardware. I ran this set-up via 0ga DC cables, second dedicated Optima Yellow Top Battery with upgraded to 130AMP Bosch alternator and Battery Isolator (battery isolator is available for additional $100 (which is about 60%off new) as this is a power house and, obviously draws some juice. 1 farad Capacitor helps big time, thus was added into the initial installation mix from the beginning and proved to be a huge value/addition.

I bought it as a carry weapon for my wife but it is just too nice for that.  I am not a firearms collector so I son't want to ruin it by having it as a daily carry gun. I would keep it as a safe queen but I need to get a different pistol for my wife and can't afford to just go out and buy one without selling this one.  The price is FIRM as I have seen these go anywhere from $600 to $1200.  I would like to just get what I paid for it or trade for something that my wife would be comfortable with.
I will look at any trades but am most interested in a Ruger LCR.

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 24 inches long, and features an 11 degree target crown for muzzle protection. It sports a full length, aluminum alloy handguard. This hand guard is knurled for a positive grip, hardcoat anodized for long life and scratch resistance, and completely free floats the barrel, enhancing accuracy and dissipating heat.  The barrel is machined from 416 R, re-sulpherized, gun quality stainless steel, and hardened to a Rockwell C of 28 to 32 for extremely long life, heat dissipation, and complete corrosion resistance. The 24 inch barrel gives a higher velocity, smaller standard deviation in velocity between shots, and greater accuracy than shorter barrels. All external steel parts are manganese phosphate finished for long lasting good looks and corrosion protection. The barrel is a BULL contour ( .950 diameter under the handguard and .935 diameter under the front sight base) for optimum accuracy The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9 twist. The barrel is mounted on a FORGED A3 upper receiver with built in Mil-spec M1913 Picatinny accessory rail, with the correct rail numbers engraved.

This assembly is ready to be pinned to any AR-15 mil-spec lower receiver and fired.

Also included is a Barska variable high power scope. It ranges from 6.5x-20x with a 50mm objective and pictured bi-pod.

Bi-pod is a UTG.

Barrel was broke in by firing 1 shot and cleaning. Doing this 10 times....then did 10 round shots and cleaned after every tenth round for a total of 110 shots to complete break-in. everything gets cleaned after being shot. Assembly has approx. 600 rounds through it....so its basically new.....

If your a reloader, I can also provide any data for the most accurate loads that I have.

The only mod I have done to this is the mounting of the bi-pod. It was designed to mount picatinny style on the gas block, but that kinda defeats the purpose of a free floated barrel! Instead it is bolted to the underside of the forgrip as seen in pic.

Asking $500 shipped or I can meet locally depending on travel distance. Feel free to ask any questions!!!

The Nikon Buckmasters 6-18x40mm Riflescope is a big improvement on one of the best selling scope lines in America, and that's no simple feat. Tricked out with more features, a cooler look, and the same great low prices, the Nikon 6-18x40 Buckmasters Rifle Scope has a more rounded, sleeker look that allows the scope to become a part of your rifle, not just an addition. Nikon has integrated the same great optics and exceptional light transmission as the current Buckmasters scopes, now up to a full 92%, and wrapped them in a more ergonomic body with 1/8-MOA click, hand-turn reticle adjustments for precise site-ins. Quick-focus eyepieces are also now standard on the Nikon Buckmasters riflescopes, as is the non-reflective, matte black finish. The Nikon Buck Masters Riflescope long range models, which previously utilized adjustable objective lenses, are now fitted with a side-focus adjustment knob to compensate for parallax. This feature allows the shooter fast, inconspicuous adjustments-and reduces the overall length of these scopes, as well. The Nikon 6-18 x 40 Buckmaster riflescopes feature durable 1"" main body tubes constructed of aircraft grade aluminum. Nikon Buckmasters scopes are O-ring sealed and nitrogen-filled for true waterproof, fogproof and shockproof performance and are backed by Nikon's Lifetime Full Warranty.

The single action trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and over travel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. The full-length grip aids in controlling recoil, and also accepts standard magazines. The Pro TLE/RL II is a near-perfect compromise of size and weight. It fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting.

I'm selling my Hi-Point 40 S&W. I bought the gun new and have put 299 rounds through it (dropped one at the range, lol). The gun is in really good condition and functions well, but it is too bulky for my needs. You get the gun, two magazines (one more than you get new), stock gun lock, a stock ghost ring sight, 5 snap caps, a bore brush, and a recently purchased box of Whinchester White Box 100 rounds FMJ.

I took a lot of pictures so you can see exactly what you're getting. The gun functioned great when I shot it yesterday, but it is of course sold as is. Hi-Point offers a life-time no questions asked warranty, so you will still be covered by warranty after the sale. You are solely responsible for anything you do with this gun or anything that happens while shooting it. 

Because this is a ""cheap gun,"" I am restricting potential sales to local people only (Palm Beach County). You must be 21 or over. You must have a CCW or be willing to have a statement notarized prior to sale that you have a clean background and are eligble to possess a handgun. I reserve the right not to sell to you for any reason. Due to all the extras, my price of $170 is firm. Cash only please.

Lifetime Warranty info on the AR15

http://www.rijasservices.com/

Our guns are guaranteed to hold a 1/2 MOA at 300 yards forever. Eight rounds, 8000 rounds, or 8 million rounds. Forever. It doesn’t matter.

Our rifles are guarranteed to do this with steel ammo, lacquered ammo, surplussed ammo or reloaded ammo. In fact any ammo listed on our competitors webisite as voiding their warranty will not void ours. We want our customers to be able to afford to shoot their weapon and have fun doing it.

If you have a provable ammo related failure to the point that it blows the back off the shell or splits the casing and does damage to the rifle the repair is 100% parts and 100% labor warrantied. With our custom rifles and pistols you do not pay for repairs or gunsmithing.

If you drop the rifle out of a tree while dee hunting, it falls off the back of your ATV that would be considered customer abuse to some manufacturers, whoever with Rijas Services that falls under the road hazard warranty. Again the rifle will be repaired at 100% parts and 100% labor warranty. All covered.

Our best advertising is spent on a satisfied customer. Would it be better to spend the money advertising in a gun magazine or solving customer related problems at no cost to the customer. That is our advertising.

The Rijas Services warranty applies to scopes, optics, and other accessories that are packaged with our weapons. If you break the scope, bring back both halves and you will receive a new scope.

Basically, the way this works when you purchase a weapon from us, whatever happens, your fault, our fault, no bodies fault, you never pay a dime again to repair the weapon. Now which weapon would you like to invest in? Would you rather pay one time or every time something goes wrong?

And a Savage 116 300 Remington ultra mag.

Forget about plastic guide rods and polymer frames ... these old AMTs are built like tanks. All bead-blasted stainless steel, weighs 21 oz. loaded (5+1). Just enough weight to reduce the felt recoil found in some pocket pistols.

Shoots anything you put in it, not just the high-dollar ammo. I've shot PMC, Blazer, Federal, Fiocchi, brass case, steel case, FMJ, JHP with no issues. One time ... once ... I bought some Tula ammo at WalMart that had a couple of misfires so I tried it in one of my other guns and 11/50 had bad primers. Not the pistol's fault.

BONUS CD: Owner's manual and takedown guide, exploded parts diagram, spec sheets and a 1993 magazine article (that's about the age of this pistol, near as I can determine). Auction price also includes a new holster (bought last week) with rubberized strip that won't move around in your pocket.

Pictured is my SR9C, which came with a full-size 17 rd. mag (not pictured).  It is tricky to conceal in other holsters I've made, but by placing the loop behind the actual holster the pressure of the belt turns the grip toward the wearer's back.  This diminishes the bulge, and I have heard of people concealing full-size 1911's and Python-sized revolvers in similar rigs.  For larger weapons than my SR9C the price may go up depending on how much more leather and stitching is involved.

I also have a number of boxes of .357 sig ammo.

The best price I see online and in stock is $1050 + $160 for the barrel + grips + ammo + tax this setup will be well over $1500 even if bought at a discount store like Midwest Hunter's Outlet.

5 x boxes .357 ammo - $100

It rides fairly high, and is quite comfortable.  I left the leather high around the top to protect the weapon from weather, since it is my Grandfather's, which makes it priceless to me.  I also found this very easy to hide under a light jacket, so if you feel the need to carry a Vaquero or a Colt SAA in concealment, this may be your holster :-)  I believe I could do the same very easily for a Blackhawk or something of comparable size, but obviously the long-barreled models would not conceal so well :-(  Also, bigger guns may increase the price somewhat

From the Manufacturer
The Gerber 30-000030 eFect weapons tool was developed for the distinct purpose of cleaning and maintaining a soldiers primary weapon. It is compatible and interchangeable with the Otis cleaning components like brushes, scrapers, pick and rods. Savvy, Ingenuity, Craftsmanship. Attention to detail. These are just a few of the company traits that contributed to our emergence as a world leader in outdoor gear. But then there's the issue of toughness. And frankly, nothing could be tougher than living down the first career of founder Joseph Gerber as that's right, an advertising man. You could call it the ""Boy Named Sue"" syndrome. And live it down we have. Joseph Gerber started Portland, Oregon's Gerber Advertising back in 1910. One Christmas, he hired a local knife maker to craft 25 sets of kitchen cutlery as client gifts. The knives were so popular, Mr. Gerber ultimately left his agency to launch Gerber Legendary Blades in 1939. It makes sense, really. An idea man gets the idea of a lifetime and turns it into a major outdoor brand. One that commands respect among knife lovers and knife makers alike. And now that high regard is spreading in new directions, in the form of many outstanding products. Such as tools, personal L.E.D. lighting and backpack hydration. With a history like ours and products like these, its no wonder we are completely unafraid of the future"

For those of you familiar with ""Cheaper Than Dirt"", this was their item SCP-120, and that's where I obtained it several years back when I worked there.  You can go to thier website, enter that item # and see reviews from people who actually have bought and used this type scope.  I bought a couple of them just because of the volume of interest whenever we got this millitary surplus in...they sold out within minutes.  And the next supply was a long time in coming. They are currently out of stock and have been for a while.  While they do mention that it fits a side rail mount, they advertise it for the AK-47, and say it will fit any with the side rail mount.  I was told by someone else, that it fits the Dragonuv Russian Tiger SSG97 PSL FPK.  I have not actually mounted or used this scope.  I bought it as an investment only.  The lens are clear; the rubber is firm in shape, but soft and pliable.  Seems to be in great shape.  If you are local, you are welcome to exam, purchase and take with you.

This is a 1790 Brittish Aquatint that has three artist's combined works in one. The original piece was painted by George Morland English Painter (1763-1804) with permission it was Etched by Thomas Rowlandson English Painter and Caricaturist (1756-1827) and Aquatinted by Samuel Alken Sr. a Brittish Sporting Artist (1756-1815). 

This was issued as a Sporting Series in 1790 and published by J. Harris and T. Merle. This was acertained by Ralph Richardson's Chronological Catalogue of Etchings and Engravings showing their years of publication (all were published in London). Reference:

http://www.sterlingtimes.org/morland_catalogue2.htm

The above link could also help reflect its value as well.

The artwork is in excellent condition for its age, the colors are period and the paper type period to its age. The piece is framed and matted and ready for display. On the right side there is a slight water stain, this could be extracted or touched up with a professional restoration, however it is not in the main body of the artwork. At the bottom left is G. Morland and T. Rowlandson's credentials and on the lower right is S. Alken's credentials with the date of 1790.

This is a period piece that does not come up for sale often, it is an original and not any type of reproduction. I have no knowledge of art and only inherited this piece and only passing on the research that I have obtained. Please research online or at a local art museum for details. I am told in an auction setting (art type) this piece should sell between 1700 - 2500 USD
