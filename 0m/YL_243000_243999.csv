*I live in Havelock and you could shoot the rifle but you have to have the cash to prove you would be willing to buy it and not just trying to shoot the gun.

This package is worth over $1800.00 so you're getting a great deal. I have never seen a AR as nice looking as this one, its definitely a one of kind. I have put maybe 60 rounds through it and I cleaned it after time I have fired it. There are absolutely no flaws with this weapon system I'm only selling it because I came up with another AR project.

I've added the prices so that you know why the rifle costs more than a new, plain Jane Rossi. After googling all of the individual pieces, the cheapest I can find everything as a package is $600.
I don't need to get rid of this rifle. It's a super accurate little plinker/hunting rifle. Only selling if the price is right to go towards a new truck.
The break open is tight on this rifle, because the foregrip (that holds the rifle together at the hinge) is brand new. It will loosen up with time and use.
The price on this rifle will only go up, because I'm always adding new things to it. This will soon have a shortened/threaded/compensated barrel that will add $150+ to the cost.

Up for grabs is this beautiful and very rare Thompson A5 lightweight. 2000 of these were made and are very hard to come by, this one has a 3 digit serial number. This one was made by Auto Ordinance (no Kahr junk) in West Hurley New York in September of 1975. The pictures you see below is the gun I have for sale, note the forward hand grip: it is NOT an AOW as it has a total factory length of 27” and there is no way to affix a stock to this. It has perfect wood and nice bluing, although there are a few very minor safe rubs.  This one came with a 13” barrel, it also comes with (6) 32rd stick mags. I am looking for $1900 cash but will consider reasonable offers. 

I prefer face to face in the greater Tampa Bay area with valid FL ID however I will ship this to the lower 48 states (from my FFL to yours) for $40.00.

Really nice condition French MAS 36-51 complete with French Sling, Rubber Boot, Bayonet and Ammo
This rifle is all matching including the bayonet. Stock is very nice some small little normal dings here and there
and the bore is Sharp, Bright and Shinny. Rifle still has some cosmoline in places, 

I have taken it down for clean up but apparently missed a few places which still have cosmoline. 
Butt stock has MAS cartouche dating September 1958. 
There are little arsenal stamp marks in different areas of the stock and forends. 
Grenade launcher complete and works nicely.

Rubber Boot is included which can be used or not, it is correctly dated MAS 1951, 
Original French Leather sling barely used and bayonet included is marked on the end with the numbers 01 
which are the last 2 digits of the serial number. Matching bayonets that are marked to the rifle are uncommon.. 

Basically this rifle appears to have hardly been fired. Its been primarily a safe queen with me. 
I fired 25 rounds through it and its a sweet enjoyable shooter.

I can also include 110 rds of French 7.5 ammo. however ammo must ship separately from the rifle and postage for the ammo
will have to be covered by new owner. I would also consider ammo exchange for calibers in 
.303 British, 30 Cal Carbine or 30-06 if that would help.

This rifle is one that is a odd ball in my collection, 
since I primarily collect British Enfield's and US weapons.

I would like to trade for a British Enfield No 5 jungle carbine primarily, 
or would consider other Enfield's also. But primarily hoping for a Jungle Carbine.

I've taken best pictures I can with the camera I have and hope these 
will help also to see the condition of this rifle

Shipped only to FFL 01 or FFL 03 (C&R) holder

Converts a 45 or 38 Super Colt Government Model to 22 LR and back again by just changing out a few parts. The floating chamber (designed by the late Carbine Williams) actually increases felt recoil from the 22 to better simulate the larger caliber and, thus, affording the owner inexpensive practice time.

Ideal for a collector, this 1953 rifle never saw action but is as ready to today as the day she was made. All matching serial numbers and original parts - bayonette & shoulder strap still intact. I fired the rifle only once to ensure that it was working properly before selling it (of course I cleaned it immediately) but other than that, its been wrapped in the original oil paper in the box it came in for 60 years. There is *zero* pitting or corrosion on the metal of the gun and the stock is un-nicked or scratched. Interesting factoid: It's the smaller, and somewhat less common cousin of the Mosin Nagant m91/30. The m91/30 rifles were designed in the 1890's and were the first bolt action rifles to contain multiple rounds in a magazine. The m44 was a later adaptation for cavalry and officers.

    ""BOTTOM LINE: I'm thrilled I found the gun, and even more thrilled that I decided to buy it. It is a major shooter that is extremely accurate for a tactical pistol with the added benefit of GLOCK reliability. This is also one of the most popular pistols among IDPA competitors. If you're looking for a good, full size tactical pistol, you couldn't do much better than the GLOCK 34. I may or may not ever compete with it, but I expect that this is a gun that will be with me until I'm too feeble to pull the slide back by myself."""

The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.
 With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.
 Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.

That being said, I have the original boxes/packaging for the gun, scope, and aftermarket stock, AND I also have the original stock (black composite, vented front end, ""beavertail"", etc)....its a great factory stock, just not pistor gripped like I like em ((I am convinced that the pistol grip has dramatically increased my accuracy and wouldn't want to go back....but in the event that someone else would, I will send it along with the purchase!)"

This is an HK91 clone built by Federal Arms Corp.

THE SCOPE IS NOT FOR SALE.

For more info, here is a great review about the rifle - http://www.ar15armory.com/forums/Federal-Arms-FA91-t2421.html

It is functionally perfect - POA = POI, I have never had a single problem with it, and it has gladly eaten anything I have fed it. Internals are in great shape, bore is flawless. I am not 100% sure I accurately remember the exact headspace measurement from the last I checked it, but I believe it was .010, which is well within spec.

Cosmetically it is in overall very good shape, with some scratches on the compensator and cocking tube, and touched-up but formerly chipped paint around the ejection port. The linked photos are an accurate representation of the condition.

It currently wears a CETME styled wooden handguard and black synthetic stock and pistol grip furniture. The pistol grip I believe was originally green and painted over. The buttstock is a solid slab - it does not have the usual sling attachment point or pin holes.

Federal Arms was bought out by Century a few years back, but this was NOT built by the Century monkeys, it pre-dates Century. Nothing on this gun has been ground. It is built on a DC Industries receiver, which is the same milled receiver used by Springfield Armory for their SAR-8 clone of the HK 91. It is a flat-top with the full-length picatinny rail.

Accessories :

    10 pre-ban 20 round magazines (7 shown in picture)
    Black handguard
    Green pistol grip, handguard & buttstock with standard sling mount and pin holes
    CETME style wood buttstock. One hole for attaching the buttstock is split because it was not properly pre-drilled and a screw went in crooked, but it is an easy fix (re-drill) and will hold securely. I just haven't bothered because personally I dosn't care for the wood look on this gun.
     217 rounds of ATI Turkish 7.62x51 (which currently go for $12.99 box of 20). I do not have a spare travel ammo case so you would need to bring your own for transport.
     CTD plastic gun case    
3-ring binder full of printed manuals including HK G3 Armorer's Manual, HK G3 Manual, various schematics and parts lists, etc.

This is a complete Palmetto State Armory 10.5"" M4 chrome-lined 5.56 AR pistol! Like new (only 26 rounds fired to sight the gun in)!! Functions perfect! The reason I am selling this is because I own two of them. The upper, lower, buffer, and bolt carrier are all marked with the cool crossed cannon logo. Any discolorations you see in the pics are just oil (I like to keep my ARs well-oiled). The buffer tube has a rubber tip slipped over the end (which can be easily pulled off if desired), that is ATF approved and aids greatly in firing the weapon and standing the weapon upright for storage. 

Barrel specs:
10.5"", hammer-forged ""machine gun steel"", chrome-lined, 5.56 NATO chamber with a 6-groove, 1:7 right-hand twist , and M4 feedramps. The barrel (as well as the bolt) is high pressure tested, and mag particle inspected. Both are marked stating this.

Not a mark on this gun - perfect condition! Any questions, feel free to ask.

This is a complete Palmetto State Armory 10.5"" M4 chrome-lined 5.56 AR pistol! Like new (only 26 rounds fired to sight the gun in)!! Functions perfect! The reason I am selling this is because I own two of them. The upper, lower, buffer, and bolt carrier are all marked with the cool crossed cannon logo. Any discolorations you see in the pics are just oil (I like to keep my ARs well-oiled). The buffer tube has a rubber tip slipped over the end (which can be easily pulled off if desired), that is ATF approved and aids greatly in firing the weapon and standing the weapon upright for storage.

Barrel specs:
10.5"", hammer-forged ""machine gun steel"", chrome-lined, 5.56 NATO chamber with a 6-groove, 1:7 right-hand twist , and M4 feedramps. The barrel (as well as the bolt) is high pressure tested, and mag particle inspected. Both are marked stating this.

Not a mark on this gun - perfect condition! Any questions, feel free to ask.

$750 (without the magazine, rear sight, or angled foregrip - since I would like to move these to another of my ARs)

This is a LIKE NEW Arsenal SA RPK-7. These weapons are US made, chambered in 7.62 x 39mm, and feature a MILLED receiver, RPK heavy barrel (23.2""), 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle nut, folding bipod, cleaning rod inside bipod, no bayonet lug, beautiful blonde wood furniture, paddle style buttstock with hole for cleaning kit. These milled receivers are the best AK receivers on the planet. They are smoother, more accurate, and more reliable than their stamped cousins. 

The woman I purchased it from claimed it belonged to her husband, who passed away several years ago. He took it to the range once to ""test it out"" and put it in the safe. You can see in the pictures the side of the receiver is not scratched yet from moving the safety lever. There is a 75 round drum, a 30 round steel magazine, a 40 round steel magazine, and one that she claimed holds 61 rounds. I only had 41 rounds of ammo laying around, and that filled the middle mag. You can see in the pictures the extra length of that other monster magazine. I cannot confirm its capacity. 

I took as many photos as I could. One shows the ONLY blemish on this weapon and that is a small mark on the stock. One photo of the bipod leg shows the cleaning rod inside it, and a couple of other odd pics are showing the bipod feet and hinge are not scratched. The dust cover and button are not scratched from removal. This weapon is nearly flawless! 

From what I can gather, this weapon is a Limited Edition #46 of 300 Arsenal produced in 2003 and did not plan on doing another run of these and are not in stock on Arsenal's site.

This rifle must go to the FFL of your choice. Make sure you know the laws in your state and if it is legal for you to own this rifle and/or magazines. I WILL NOT ship to California!"

All of the serial numbers match. The gun was produced in 1863 according to the serial number. All of the brass is in great condition for being 150yrs old and the bluing isnt to bad with most of it turning to grey because of the age. There is no rust on it asfar as i can see there are a few very minor pitting places but again thats due to the age of the gun. The grips are origal as well and have James carved in one side of them. You can tell the carving was done may many years ago probably when the gun was new. Who knows could have something to do with Jesse James family. If you have any questions feel free to ask and ill get back with you as soon as possible.

Well if you have a kid that's into sports/cards, I have a great Christmas present you could give him...may be you could keep a few for yourself too...

First, a few hundred cards from the 1910's to today. Including 1964 Topps Giants Mickey Mantle graded a 5 . 1964 NM Topps Hank Aarron. Don Mattingly Rookie Graded with a signed baseball. Antique John C. Heenan 1910 boxing card PSA graded a 2.5. Antique Frank E. Smith 1912 baseball card Graded PSA 2. 1954 bowman Frank Gifford. Lots of Rookies: Barry Sanders, Deion Sanders, Boomer Esiason, Ken Griffy Jr., ShaqONiel, Barry Bonds Gem 10, Roger Craig, +more...many other non rookie cards...Joe Namath, Marcus Allen, Joe Montana, John Elway, 1952 Graded George Ratterman, Reggie White...on and on... some graded some not, PSA2-PSA10 condition.

200+ cards? I don't know, lots...I could count them if you like.

I would say the most valuable item is a signed Joe DiMaggio Baseball with a PSA certificate in a plexiglass display. Do a search for Joe DiMaggio autographed baseball... they're expensive.

I was going to sell this collection so I could buy a gun, but if anyone would like to trade, it would be easier.

I would probably expect to get at least $400-$600 trade value."

The only cosmetic issue is there is a ring around the cylinder from it being cycled. The finish behind the cylinder release button is more gray than blue. Because Titanium is such a hard metal, most finishes/polish are very superficial.

It is unbelievable how light it is. Titanium is lighter than aluminum. It's much lighter than steel.
The barrel is ported to reduce the recoil.
This revolver does come with the factory Taurus box, key, paperwork, a pair of HKS 587 speed loaders
