Sadly the time has come to sell. I recently took it to a couple local gun shops and multiple experts at a gun show. The gun has only had 8 rounds through it over the past 7 years and from the condition I would venture to say that round count goes back much further. The barrel is in pristine condition and is the matching 1944 barrel. My guess is that the rifle was used very little as a training rifle or something light like that. 

Most of them valued the gun between $2,000-$2,400 with out the ammo. I didn't think I was going to sell it but the time has come. I have 18 8rd clips (only 10 are pictured), 100 rds of M2 Ball and 92 Rounds of Federal. I will include the ammo for an extra 200.

Taken from Sig's website:

The legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic is a semi-automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic features the original Swiss folding stock, as well as a polymer ergonomic forend.

The Classic’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ button rifled barrel.
SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor. The SIG 556 Classic brings back the look and feel of one of the world’s most sought after military rifles but on a platform available for law enforcement and responsible citizens.

This rifle came with a 17"" barrel instead of the stated 16"".

Stock does not interfere with grip or trigger in the folded position making it an awesome and compact high capacity assault weapon (not to mention theres always the bayonet if needed). Unfolded it makes a great high powered hunting rifle, many deer are taken with a Norinco SKS. I figure value is $575-$600 and would trade for a brand new handgun in that price range, but for a cash sale I will take $475 FIRM. This is a lot of rifle for the money.

Take, for example, the listing just below for a ""SPRINGFIELD ARMORY M1A STANDARD 308 NO RESERVE 2 MAGAZINES INCLUDED - ONE 10 ROUND AND ONE 20""

Gee... what do we have here:
http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=326884725

It has all of the hallmarks of a SCAM listing -- notice it has ""NO RESERVE"" in the title, meaning this was posted by a LAZY scammer that just cut-and-pasted the listing from a site like Gunbroker, etc. The scammer doesn't bother to post an actual LOCATION for the gun anywhere, just ""Alabama"". I'll bet, if contacted, he'll claim the gun is actually in some far-off location just waiting to be shipped to the FFL of your choice -- after payment, of course. Also, he doesn't include any contact info or even a first name. He does say anything about anything. Also, check the ""Listings by this user"" feature to see if he's trolling with more scams and FLAG THEM ALL.

So... FLAG ANY LISTING that does not provide at least SOME of the following:

(1)  A real location where the item is located. 
(2)  Information other than Cut-and-Paste specs, etc.
(3)  A person's first name and/or contact info.

Or posts that have dead-giveaway text like ""NO RESERVE"", etc.

Yes, some legitimate posts will be flagged, but they can re-post afterward with more substantive, less questionable information afterward. This will help others and weed out on forum noise that is at a fevered pitch right now.

Anyway, take it FWIW. Just trying to help."

I’ve been an IT Consultant for many years, with a side project of making artwork out of old computer parts in my spare time.  This used to be a good accompaniment back in the day – a part or two would go out, I’d replace the bad, and then keep the bad piece to make a sculpture or wall hanging or something.  Anymore, though, computers hold up a lot better so I’m not getting nearly as much stuff as I used to.

I’m working with a company right now to replace some of their aging technology.  Most of the computers I will have are going to be Dell desktops of moderate performance – if you’re looking for a top-of-the-line gaming system or something, I’m not going to have anything for you.  If, though, you’re looking for something for the kids to tinker with so they stay off your computer, something for just web browsing, that sort of thing, keep reading!

The specific computer in this posting is a Dimension 2400.  It has a Pentium 4 Processor, rated at 3.06ghz, with 2gb of RAM and a 40gb Hard Drive.  The hard drive has been wiped and I installed linux on the computer – the case does have a sticker with a key for Windows XP, so if you would rather have that installed you can get a disk and do so.  

I’d value this computer at about $20, out the door, with a mouse, keyboard and power cable.  If you need a monitor, we can talk – I have a few that I can offer.

Other stuff to trade – I have a Canon PC420 Copier, a Photosmart A646 Photo Printer, a Laserjet 3015 All-In-One unit, several computer cases of different sizes and shapes, computer power supplies, keyboards, mice, etc – if you’re looking for something that came out of an office, shoot me a message and maybe I can help you out!"

Saiga 7.62x39 AK47(Russian AK for quality of course!)

Well used veteran paint job in ATACs.  If you don't like that veteran beat up look of a real battle rifle that gets used this gun isn't for you.  I use weapons as a tool of protection so I train with them not leave them in safes to collect dust and show off guns to be cool.  If you're looking for a gun to be ""cool"" once again this isn't for you.  The AK47 is made for reliability, ability to shoot steel ammo easily, and be thrown around covered in mud, dirt, snow, etc and still perform great!!!

My rifle and everything included today is virtually priceless!  Everyone want to get their hands on a rifle and look around people are jacking up prices for the wrong reasons!!!  Gun owners should help each other out which is what I'm doing!  I'm including absolutely everything needed to be sufficient!!!  I have taken the time to research and develop the perfect training/hunting/combat rifle.  I have taken time to test and record my findings which is exactly what high end companies do such as bravo company (BCM) to ensure out military/LEOs know they can trust their life on their weapon.

I don't want to part out.  As I don't plan on buying another AK so u don't want to try and sell and/or keep extra stuff around.  But of course I may be able to work something out.

Ok, in striker fire, so the firing pin is one piece. Big deal?

Why is a gun listed with an ""Action: Striker fire"" The firing pin is not an action, its a component of the gun. Action is how the gun operates. How does a striker fire gun operate? Striker fire is not an answer to that question.

A weapon is only as reliable as its magazine. Designed by HK to provide an uncompromising reliable feeding source for existing M16 type systems and SA80, the HK High Reliability Magazine has been combat proven by various U.S. Special Operations and foreign military units worldwide. Its superiority has been evidenced throughout extensive testing in arctic, desert, jungle, and maritime environments.

It features a well-executed design, select materials, special anti-friction surface finish, advanced spring material, attention to production tolerances, and a heat-treated steel magazine housing and follower. For use in extreme environments HK now offers a special Maritime coating which easily surpasses the US MIL-STD-810 E salt fog test. During this test, the HK High Reliability Magazines were exposed to a 100 hour salt fog and then stored three days at ambient temperature. After this test procedure each magazine was fully loaded with rounds and fired twice with no problems experienced.

In U.S. military testing, the HK magazine improved feeding reliability of the system by 30-50% overall."

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This listing will be deleted if the gun is sold.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."
