Do you go all out and participate in the growing sport of Cowboy Action Shooting? Are you one of the many thousands of avid big-game hunters?

Nod yes to any of the above, and you're ready to step up and grab hold of the new Henry Big Boy .44 rifle. It's big, brutal, and beautiful. Henry rifle owners were inquiring when they would look back to their historical roots and Henry's designers did just that. The result is the first American made .44 Henry lever action featuring a solid brass receiver since the original Henry rifle of 1860.

The adventure and romance of America's Old West are imbedded in its distinctive 20"" octagon barrel, straight-grip American walnut stock with brass buttplate and brass barrel band. The solid top brass receiver features side ejection. The overall length is 38½"" and this powerhouse weighs in at 8.68 lbs.

A nice 19th century touch is the use of a fully adjustable Marble semi-buckhorn rear sight with white diamond insert and brass beaded front sight. The .44 is the cartridge that was said to have ""killed more game, big and small, and more men, good and bad, than any other in existence."" Our tubular magazine can pack ten of these powerful bruisers. The .44 Mag is a serious hunting tool, and has proven itself time and time again on all of the world's game. We trust the Henry Big Boy .44 will soon become a favorite of big game hunters due to its handsome looks, rugged reliability and proven knockdown power.

LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many shooters learn the basics of target shooting with this handy little carbine. 

This illuminated four reticle scope is especially suitable for youngsters as they only have to place the reticle on the target and squeeze the trigger.  It can be used with both eyes open and the UNLIMITED eye relief feature allows it to be mounted any comfortable distance from the shooter’s eyes.  The small scope profile also makes it easy to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

Included in this kit is our popular 10/22 Picatinny rail mount which is easy to install with the included machine screws.

Ideal for carbine-length rifles in the 11.5 to 16"" range. The 10.0's length stops about an inch past of a carbine-length gas block, providing true free-float. Our two-pin proprietary barrel nut system with its locking anti-slip plate, sets LaRue handguards apart from the competition. Once properly installed, there is no chance of movement whatsoever. The side and bottom rails are tucked closer to the barrel, keeping the profile narrower and more streamlined. LaRue handguards also include integral QD sling-swivel sockets at the base of each side for convenient mounting 2-point slings. Additionally, our Free-float Rail system provides an excellent heat-sinking feature that pulls throat-damaging heat away from the chamber area. Another heat-sinking benefit is the elimination of pressure-spikes, which some feel is the cause of a large part of pre-mature bolt failures. 

Comes complete with Allen wrench, vial of blue Locktite and Instructions. 

Features:
· Weighs .92lb
· CNC-machined out of aluminum
· Integral QD sling-swivel sockets on both sides
· Hard coat anodized, with T-Numbers
· Low-profile bottom and side rails
· Special rail cuts allow both mil-issue and standard rail covers

Troy Folding Battle Sight- Front, HK Style

The Troy Folding Battle Sights have set a World Standard for design and quality by which all other Back Up Iron Sights are judged. They are easily installed and position the apertures at the exact same height as the factory sights, with no levers or springs to fumble with, deployment of the sight under stress is easy. The robust stainless steel cross locking system ensures your sights will remain up and zeroed in the most extreme combat conditions. To fold simply press the release button located on the left side of the sight. All Troy Sights feature a zero-canting attachment system for use on all military and aftermarket receivers. No tools are required for adjustment. Each click equals .50 MOA of adjustment.  

These sights are rugged, snag free, and have a positive lock for accuracy and reliability. They are designed for instant deployment without levers or springs and are engineered to fit a variety of weapons such as the M-4, M-16, AR-10, and SR-25.  Made in the USA.

Ruger designed the LCP specifically for concealed carry. It is very thin at 0.82″ thick, so it’ll be more comfortable for users to carry in a pocket or waist holster. It is made of hardened steel and has a glass-filled nylon grip frame. The glass filling makes the frame more resistant to wear. For example, against something like friction caused between the action and frame when a shooter not properly lubricating the weapon before shooting. The cartridge .380 ACP is slightly smaller than the 9mm and performs comparably to it. The major difference, besides size, is .380 ACP has less stopping power.

The difference between the LCP and the LCP-CT is the LCP-CT comes standard with a Crimson Trace laser. The laser’s moniker is LG-431 and was specifically fitted for the LCP. It works automatically when a shooter wraps a hand around the grip because a finger will naturally press the activation button, so the shooter doesn’t have to think about turning it on or off. It presses and depresses naturally.

In May 2009, Ruger issued a recall of certain LCPs because some users reported the weapon accidentally discharged when hitting a hard surface when it had a round in the chamber. The recall affects models with a serial number beginning with “370-“ However, models that have been fixed were stamped with a diamond in the hammer’s slot. For more information or to see if a particular LCP is affected contact Ruger."

Do your research, people. There is NO BAN. Obama can't pass a ban without Congress, the House won't let it pass, and the Senate won't even put it up for a vote, knowing it will be shot down. We are winning the battle. Obama's 23 point plan is all he can do, it will not affect any legal, law abiding citizens, and your AR's and 30 round mags are safe. The rifles are showing back up in the stores, and ammo is available again, if you look. Don't pay $1/round or $3000 for an AR from these ""get it before the ban"" guys. Wait a week or two and see what happens. 

Stop ripping each other off, and let's start working together to protect our freedoms. 

Again, THERE IS NO BAN coming!!!

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

**NOTE** We will send you an additional 30 round magazine for free from KVAR, our distrubtor for this rifle, once the magazines come in stock."

Each Gold Dot bullet is individually engineered to provide shot-to-shot uniformity and ensure optimum performance when fired through a variety of barriers. The result is a cartridge that provides officers the ultimate defense in lethal force confrontations.

Most bullets perform adequately in soft tissue, but fragment or expand prematurely when obstructed by bone, heavy clothing or any number of other potential real life shooting barriers. Gold Dot was the first handgun ammunition to be loaded with high-performance bonded core bullets. Gold Dot's superior process bonds the jacket to the core one molecule at a time, virtually eliminating core jacket separations. That's why Gold Dot is the #1 choice for law enforcement professionals."

Very Non-PC Single owner Intratec AB-10. The AB-10 was produced by Intratec after the 1994 weapons ban. It functions the same as a Tec-9 but does not have a shrouded or threaded barrel which were made illegal. Though dubbed the ""AB-10"" for ""After Ban- 10 round magazine"" it still came with a pre-ban 32 round magazine.  I have the 32 round magazine as well as a 20 and 50 round magazine.  

With the extra magazines and factoring in that this type of firearm will never be made again nor made available for sale in the near future, I am asking $580 OBO

I took all the internal parts out and polished everything relating to the trigger and installed Wolf Springs.  At the same time, I installed a Hogue Monogrip as well.  Now the trigger pull is smoother than you can imagine and breaks like glass in SA mode.  Most people who have shot it tell me that the DA trigger pull is so smooth that they wouldn't even bother cocking the hammer.  My sight picture always seemed a bit fuzzy so I filed into the front sight to create a ""partridge"" effect.  Now the sight picture is crisp no matter the glare or brightness outside.  
The round count is 300-400 rds of factory Federal and Fiocci ammo.  I haven't reloaded for this caliber yet so no hand loads have been run through it.  If the picture on here is not clear or show the details of the gun, I am including a flickr link for high resolution photos.  This little gun has killed six White Tail deer (legal here) and is scary accurate.  In my opinion it is far better than a brand new SP101 just like it.  If you want a gun that is easy to carry concealed but still easily capable of taking medium game out to at least 30 long paces....this one is tried and true.  The price is 600.00.  I will ship to an FFL anywhere in the lower 48 for 20.00 Thanks for looking.  

As for trades.....Only one gun or type....  A Kimber Compact Stainless 1911. (This is a 4"" barrel on an officer's size frame).  It is often referred to as a ""CCO"" I could ad cash to level the trade.
