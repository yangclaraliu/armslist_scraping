The USC
Derived from the HK UMP, the USC is a civilian utility carbine that uses the classic hard-hitting .45 ACP cartridge. Matched with the simple and ultra-reliable blowback operating system, the HK USC is a radical departure from traditional firearms designs. Extensive use of the same durable, reinforced polymers used on HK's line of military and police arms ensures lightweight and durability. And the highest grade of weapons steel is used where it matters-in the cold hammer forged target barrel and the solidly constructed bolt mechanism. User ergonomics are not sacrificed. The skeletonized buttstock is topped with a comfortable rubber cheek rest and recoil pad. The web of the pistol grip is open for a comfortable shooting handhold. Hard points located on the top and front of the receiver make attachment of optional Picatinny rails easy, allowing almost any kind of sighting system or accessory to be mounted.

Features:
.Tough, light weight, corrosion proof polymer construction
.Molded-in hard points for mounting accessories
.Accessory Picatinny rails for easy mounting of optical sights, lights, and aiming devices
.Rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation
.Easy disassembly for simple cleaning and maintenance
.Ambidextrous safety/selector lever
.Open, skeletonized buttstock for better grip
.Oversized trigger guard for easy operation while wearing gloves
.Sixteen inch cold-hammer forged target barrel
.Rubber cheek rest and buttstock recoil pad
.Polymer 10-round magazine
.Lifetime warranty"

The reason im looking to sell or trade this is because im wanting to get another 94 that i dont have to worry about sratching up in the woods and where i hunt, its pretty thick, so dont want to ruin this one. Ill guarantee it to be a great shooter. Im prefering a trade, but will accept cash offers. I have almost 600 dollars invested in the gun and accessories. I will get rid of the gun seperate from the accessories if desired. Accessories include new rcbs dies, 100 new unprimed brass, 100 new soft core bullets, 20 rounds of ammo, and soft leather case. thanks for looking....what trades do you have?"

It is my firm belief that rifles like this will some day be banned, not if, but when, especially ones that are imported.
The AK-103 style folding stock is only imported by Arsenal. You can interchange it with the polymer AK-103 folding stock ($200, not included).
Both are indistinguishable from a solid stock in terms of handling and very compact. It makes a loud bang when unfolding, just to give you an idea.

Unfired and comes with 3 Circle 10 magazines and 500 rounds of brown bear lacquer.
It comes with stainless steel heatshield and polymer handguard, 90 degrees gas block and double crescent muzzle brake.
It is an AK-103 in all aspect except not full auto.

I'm asking for $1050.
That's not a bargain but it's a damn good deal.

An identical rifle at Arsenal right now is $859. That is the polymer version, my version with the steel stock has been out-of-stock for months.
You add in FFL fees + 3 Circle10 magazines ($30 each)+ 500 rounds of brown bear, and it's a pretty good deal, considering that it is unfired. 
The barrel is also hammer-forged, chrome-lined.

I have never fired it so I do not know the accuracy, but the certification sheet of the 3 test shots at the factory indicate around 2 MOA."

this is in my opinion one of the ultimate woodsman guns. powerful, heavy duty. it's a ruger!!!

Ruger basically canned this model because they could make more money on the GP100 line - which is the single/security six design stripped down to be more profitable (slightly debatable, but it's true you know it). They don't make 'em like this anymore - and probably never will. One of the last of the affordable durable service revolvers. and hey, if 6 rounds of 357 doesn't get the job done, you can use the gun as one wicked freakin club to finish what you started.

I have several other pictures of both guns, just contact me with your email adress and i will send whatever pictures you need. I also have a brand new Harris bipod listed in the acessories section. Would like to trade for another firearm item.

Flobert: During the period from the 1890s through about 1920 ""Boy's rifles"" were very popular items for youngsters. Belgium was a major source of inexpensive guns, and many thousands were imported, often sold by big mail order companies like Sears, Montgomery Wards, etc.  The most common action used was a ""Flobert"" design; this is similar to what Americans often call a ""rolling block"" action. Most Flobert rifles were .22 rim fire (sometimes short, or long, or long rifle).  Sometimes other caliber's are seen, .25 or .32 rim fire, or even 9mm rim fire.  

Arisaka Type 38 School Training Rifle 6.5X50: At various times, rifles were removed from military service and sold to other countries or transferred to Japanese schools as training weapons. Normally, the chrysanthemum on these rifles was over stamped with the Koishikawa (Tokyo) / Kokura Arsenal symbol or a ring of small circles to indicate that the rifle no longer belonged to the Imperial Japanese Army. Rifles given to schools often have an additional character stamped on the top of the receiver between the chrysanthemum and the type designation characters. Most of these ""school-marked"" rifles also have two or three zeros preceding the serial number."

In good condition, shows some minor finish wear, nothing you wouldn't expect from a weapon of this age. 
Has the following upgrades installed:
- Tapco T6 full synthetic tactical stock (black) with lower rail and no bayonet cut. This stock is full (American) length when fully extended, so you won't be all crouched over the stock trying to get a good sight picture.
- Receiver cover-mounted scope base with Picatinny/Weaver rail. The original iron sights are in place and functional, since the base and rings are shoot-through. 
- 6x32 compact scope with P4 sniper reticle and high rings. This scope is great, since it's compact size avoids needing a shell deflector to keep the casings from hitting the underside of the scope. Plus, you can still use stripper clips if you want.
- (1) 30-round steel removable magazine. (honestly, it's not great, but looks cool)
- (1) Tapco 20-round polymer removable mag. This mag is pure awesome. Feeds like butter!
- Tapco Extended Mag Release. (makes a HUGE difference in reloading. I can swap mags now almost as quick as on my dad's AR.)
- Wolff Spring Kit. (to lighten up the trigger pull)
- Custom action spring buffer in the upper housing. (to quiet down the action noise and prolong the life of the weapon by reducing the shock from the bolt carrier slamming into the the receiver housing every time the gun is fired)
- Slotted (pin-on) flash suppressor.
- Custom made wood (Bubinga) vertical grip (I was bored and wanted to make something on my lathe) :)
- ~60 rounds of steel cased FMJ ammo (New Russian Mfg, not surplus junk)

 I do not have the cleaning rod or bayonet. The previous owner removed them to install the monte carlo synthetic stock that was on it when I bought it. 

I polished the bolt sled (lower bolt) and polished and refinished the upper bolt (the part you pull back) to improve the look of the weapon and to smooth out the action. This gun has one of the cleanest bores I've ever seen on an SKS. I was planning to make this my personal project rifle, but the realities of life force me to sell it and pay bills. :( Anyway, my loss is your gain. I'm open to partial trades if you have something I want. 
* Sorry for the less-than-stellar photos, I'm not such a wiz with the camera! :)
**These are getting really rare**
I talked to my gunsmith/dealer and he said that none of his suppliers have any SKS rifles for sale, period.
UPDATE: A few new SKS rifles have started showing up in my dealer's catalogs, for $325 stock, dealer cost. You'll probably start seeing these for around $400, if at all.

This is a Century imported Romanian made (Cugir factory) PSL 54c.  Also known as the ROMAK III...and also known as the Romanian Dragunov.  These rifles are actually based on the hard hitting and very accurate Romanian RPK machine gun and designed to be a designated marksman rifle.  Call it what you will, it's a hard hitting, dang good looking, and very cheap to shoot rifle that'll get you up to 1.5MOA if you do your part.

It shoots the 7.62x54r round which is easy to find in military surplus cirlces like AIM surplus, ammunition to go, and most of the popular gun/accessories sites online.  20 cents a round for mildly corrosive ammo (which is easy to clean, don't be fooled) and you have power that bests the .308 and rivals the 30-06.  

The POSP type optic has very good glass, an excellent combat reticle, fine adjustments, and it slides on and off the rifle base effortlessly but stays put under fire.

If you're reading this post you already know what this rifle is and you've long wanted one.  This has a total of 50 rounds through it and it's pretty much rid of it's cosmoline.  It comes with one 10 round mag and I have a full size aftermarket case to put it in for you.  The furniture is very attractive on this one and the fit is excellent.  Sometimes the raging monkeys at Century put these together poorly, but lately (and this is evidence of it), they've been doing a good job.

It's the MWR Lite 8 mag version. Has MOLLE up the sides, 4x4, with 4 mag pouches with adjustable lids, MOLLE along the front of them, with grommets for drainage, and a built in map/MRE pocket. MOLLE up the straps plus comm loops for a radio or water tube, and has the H-harness with it. It is a flawless rig, never used. If you are using an AR15, they will fit 2 mags per pouch, whether mil spec or Pmags absolutely fine. It really is a great rig, and if I were using an AR15 instead of an AK, I wouldn't be trying to get rid of it. 

These rigs are considered to be some of the best made, period. Beyond mil-spec toughness.

From the Kel-Tec site:
The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. From the very beginning of the design and development, computers have been used exclusively. All machined components are also made on modern high speed computerized equipment. Equally advanced quality control equipment and test procedures ensure a firearm with uncompromising quality in materials and workmanship."

723,http://www.armslist.com/posts/43723,For Sale:  KIMBER ULTRA CARRY TLE CRIMSON TRACE,"Brookside/Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma","$ 1,300","Listed On: Wednesday, July 21, 2010",Handguns,Kimber                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,no type,Pistol,"Size matters in a concealed carry pistol. Reduced dimensions and light weight are as important as magazine capacity and power. Kimber Ultra Carry pistols in .45 ACP and 9mm have it all, and put it together in a 1911 package that simply outperforms any other type of semi-auto.

Ultra Carry II pistols weigh just 25 ounces, 13 ounces less than a full-size 1911. Combining light weight with a 3-inch barrel and short grip makes them easy to carry and conceal. Attention to every detail is another reason Kimber quality is unsurpassed. Machined bevels at both the front and rear of the Ultra Carry ejection port ensure ejecting brass reliably clears, avoiding jams common to other brands.

All Kimber pistols feature a match grade barrel, chamber and trigger. Ultra Carry bull barrels are fitted directly to the slide, keeping maximum weight forward to reduce recoil and speed sight recovery time between shots. 

To ensure dependability, Ultra Carry light weight aluminum frames are machined on the same computer-driven machines and to the same unequaled tolerances as Kimber steel frames. Each model has standard Kimber features like rounded and blended edges, beveled magazine well, extended thumb safety and bumped beavertail grip safety. Magazine capacity is 7 rounds in .45 ACP. They fit almost any size hand and point naturally. Best of all, the crisp, clean single action trigger eliminates long travel, heavy pull and the guessing that goes with it. For concealed carry, nothing beats a 1911 - and no 1911 beats a Kimber.

741,http://www.armslist.com/posts/43741,For Sale:  500 Rounds of Speer Frangible ammo--40 S&W,"East, Wichita, Kansas",$ 180,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 21, 2010",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The ammo is good for steel plinking, up close training, and cleaner for indoor range usage. 
website description:
This is 40 S&W Speer Lawman Clean Fire 125gr. Reduced Hazard Taining (RHT) Frangible Ammo. For clean, close-up training, you need a lead-free bullet that crumbles into very small pieces when it hits a metal backstop. Lawman RHT ammunition features a precision-formed bullet made of sintered copper, which is powdered copper that's compressed under heat and pressure to form a bullet. Sintered technology means there's no separate jacket that can produce sharp fragments on impact with a steel backstop. The tip of each RHT bullet is distinctively marked so range officers can easily tell it from conventional ammunition. You also need a primer that's free of lead, barium and antimony. This ammo has that covered with the CCI Clean-Fire primer. Clean-Fire priming not only eliminates the heavy metals found in conventional primers but also leaves very little residue in the shellcase and firearm, which results in shooters and their equipment stay cleaner. Lawman RHT Ammunition is the right choice for improving air quality in indoor training ranges, or for ranges where bullet bounce-back has proved to be a problem. Use RHT for clean and close realistic training and practice."

853,http://www.armslist.com/posts/43853,For Sale:  Body Armor Vest,"Caldwell (south of Wichita), Wichita, Kansas",$ 150,"Listed On: Thursday, July 22, 2010",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is my woodland camo PASGT body armor protective vest. It is a medium (chest 37 to 41 inches), but seems to run larger (I am 6'3"" 208lbs.). It is in good condition an comes with a desert camo cover to accommodate different environments. I am looking for $150 obo. Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Here is some background information on the vest:

The Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops Vest, also known as the ""flak vest"", was the United States Military's standard upper torso body armor from the early 1980s until approximately 2004, when it was replaced by the Interceptor body armor. The PASGT Vest replaced the Vietnam War-era M-69 Fragmentation Protective Body Armor nylon vest, which in turn replaced the Korean War-era M-1952A Fragmentation Protective Body Armor. The PASGT Vest used Kevlar for the first time in the United States military's body armor, unlike the ballistic nylon used in the previous two models. While incapable of stopping rifle bullets, the PASGT Vest provided better protection against shrapnel and reduced the severity of injuries from small arms fire when compared to the M-69. Anecdotally, it provides roughly level IIIA ballistic protection, not accounting for blunt force injuries, stopping rounds as powerful as a .44 magnum from a handgun[2] in certain test methodologies.  The PASGT Vest weighed approximately 9 pounds, a small increase over the previous model.

In order to provide protection against high velocity bullets, the PASGT Vest was, in 1996, combined with the Interim Small Arms Protective Overvest (ISAPO) pending adoption of Interceptor body armor. The ISAPO weighed about 16.5 pounds and consisted of a carrier to hold two protective ceramic plate inserts. A PASGT armor system with overvest weighed more than 25 pounds and was criticized by many US troops as unacceptably cumbersome in combat. The ballistic fill consists of 13 plies of 14 oz. water repellent treated Aramid (Kevlar 29) fabric. The inner and outer cover, shoulder pads and front closure flap of the vest are water repellent treated 8 oz. ballistic nylon cloth. While phased out as frontline body armor by the time of the 2003 Iraq War, some Army units would use old PASGT Vests as makeshift armor for their vehicles in the absence of purpose-made up-armor kits."

I am asking $595 for the gun.  I would consider a trade deal for a Kahr PM9."

It has about 300 rounds through it. Finish is about 97% as it has some mild barrel smileys and the slide has a little holster wear. It took about 150 rounds to break in the magazines which weren't feeding some hollow points at first (common problem with many taurus semi-autos). The first four rounds didn't feed properly. The magazines now feed most hollow points. FMJ ammo has always fed perfectly. This gun has a polished feed ramp from the factory which is nice. Taurus also provides a life long guarantee on the gun. In fact, I already used it to get a free guide rod/spring because the initial one had some corrosion on it. I was going to get replacement magazines too but I got the 3 I had working good. They are pretty good to deal with.

I carried this hiking and around town both concealed and in a SERPA holster also for sale with it. I'm upgrading to a magnum gun for bears (yep, had a black bear encounter last weekend camping and learned my .45 would not have done much) and need to sell this. I've had several .45 polymer guns and oddly enough, this inexpensive little Taurus is much more comfortable and a better recoil manager. Yes, I know that doesn't sound likely, but it's got a smaller and much more ergonomic grip (it's like a .40 sized grip, not a .45), and it handles recoil easier than the glock 21sf and M&P45 I had. It is also a very good looking gun. I enjoyed carrying it concealed and OWB with 12+1 rounds and recommend it over the heavier, larger glock 21.  One other cool feature of this gun is that it's not just a SA/DA striker fired gun, it's SA option will go to DA if the striker falls on a bad primer or hard primer.  Pretty cool feature, and the SA pull is very light and crisp, the DA pull is long and safe.  Oh yeah, the manual safety also decocks the striker when pushed all the way up.  Find these features on ANY other .45 gun, if it exists, then find it for under $400!

For $325 you get the gun, 3 magazines that hold 12 rounds each, and the hard case with cleaning brush and mag loader. I paid $385 for it 6 months ago so I figure $325 is more than fair.

For $425 you'll also get 320 rounds (170+ are 230grain FMJs, 150+ are assorted 230grain JHPs) AND a blackhawk SERPA holster with both the paddle attachment and the belt attachment. The ammo and holster are at least $150 worth of stuff, I'm bundling them with the gun for only $100.

I'd prefer a face to face transaction. Contact me with any questions."

Has built in sling swivels on both sides for ambidextrous use. First $75 takes it, and I will consider other offers. Will consider shipping out of state with added shipping charge. Will consider trading for a Harris bipod with cash. These retail for over $200 new from the manufacturer. Get it while it's hot.
