On the first day back at the Capitol, lawmakers introduce new legislation in an effort to curb gun violence. 


The ammo control bill would require people buying ammunition to show identification, and sellers would have to report all ammo sales to the state Justice Department.

The 2013 Legislative Session officially began Monday. School safety is a top priority.

State and local leaders held a moment of silence to pay respects to the 26 victims of the Sandy Hook, Conn., school shooting. Then State Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) introduced AB 48 to regulate ammunition sales in California.

""It is easier in California to buy bullets than to buy alcohol, cigarettes or Sudafed cold medicine,"" said Skinner.

Skinner's proposal seeks to:

- Require ammunition dealers to be licensed
- Buyers must present identification
- All sales are to be reported to the California Department of Justice with local law enforcement notified when transactions involve large quantities
- Conversion kits that allow high-capacity magazines will be banned.

Assemblyman Tim Donnelly (R-Twin Peaks) says that won't work.

""None of these measures, had they been in place, would have done a single thing to prevent what happened,"" said Donnelly.

In fact, Donnelly is readying a different proposal to have at least one anonymous person at each school armed.

""We haven't had a single hijacking since 9/11, and I think it is in large part due to the presence of air marshals,"" said Donnelly. ""So why don't we have a school marshals program?""

As lawmakers hammer out how to improve school safety in California, Senator Leland Yee (D-San Francisco) has been getting taunting messages for his proposal to close a loophole that enables shooters to re-load faster.

""Rather than dealing with the heart of an issue, that they resort to racist innuendos, suggestions, and it's just really unfortunate,"" said Yee.

According to the campaign-finance watchdog group Common Cause, unlike in Washington, DC, the gun lobby in California has not been particularly strong, so gun control measures have a good chance of passage."

Hi the other day I happened to get lucky and grab 2 Promags for the Ruger 10/22 at the local Bass Pro Shop that hold 32 rounds of .22 ammo for the rifle. My intentions were to use these at the range so i didn't have to spend 60% of my time reloading my Ruger.

(Unfortunately it takes 30 seconds to shoot 10 rounds and 2 mins to reload it, can be annoying at times.)

Have a scope mount in the picture too. This is the best and most solid mount you can get. It mounts in the rear sight mount and bolts down on the rear trunnion. It is much better than side mount or top cover mount. To take top cover off to clean rifle all you do is loosen the trunnion stock bolt and tip it up. It is fitted to the recess in the trunnion so when screwed back down scope will be back on target.
WILL FIT ALL WASR, ROMANIAN, AND AK FIXED STOCK RIFLES

I typically use gunbroker to help price out ranges, I've seen this sold new a few places for anywhere from 250-330 so I put 300 here but depends on condition and all of course, so tell me!

As with all Ruger's, this rifle is built like a tank.

This is a piston driven rifle and as such does not run as dirty as the normal direct impingement system.  The gases are expelled externally (like an AK) rather than back into your reciever where they ""gunk"" up the bolt carrier.  The piston system also allows you to open up the gas port and allow more gas in if you have weak ammo.  This rifle was done right by Ruger.  Check out the reviews online.

Rifle had 10 rounds fired through it to function test it after purchase.  It functioned flawlessly and has been a ""safe queen"" ever since.  Rifle was bought in August 2012 and is in like new condition.

I am using the proceeds towards the purchase of a tractor and as such I am not able to take trades toward the rifle (sorry, but cash only).

OBO.
From their website:
The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*. Longer barrel lengths of 24"", 26"" and 32"" will be available in the future. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.."

If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

USP
Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

Features:
•Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
•Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life 
•Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes 
•Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
•Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves 
•One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
•Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories 
•Ambidextrous magazine release lever
•Extended slide release 
•Patented Lock-Out Safety device

Variant 3:  Double action/single action without ""SAFE” position. Control lever (decocking lever) on left side of frame."

Ive only fired 20 rounds out of it and it was recently cleaned.  She cycles great!  Is very accurate (yes it is sighted in) and while recoil is tough as ud expect from a .30-06 the rubber recoil pad is great at reducing pain (and im not the biggest guy either.)  The reason i have it priced the way i do is because it is in NIB condition, already sighted in (@100 yrds) and im including everything in the picture with it.  Unfortunately i have to stand by the price so i prefer only serious buyers only.

What it comes with:
   Unopened winchester 225 blk cotton patches useable in calibres .30- .50
   Hoppes rifle cleaning kit with different size copper brushes to cover most gun barrel sizes .22 and larger
   2 A-Zoom .30-06 Snap Caps 
   1 Allen Polyester Rifle Gun Sock
   1 Allen carrying case 
   3 boxes of 20 rounds .30-06 ammunition: winchester and remington 1 165 gr and 2 150 gr
   The original box the rifle came in.

Another note is i have to sell all of this together as im not buying another rifle anytime soon and the rest of the stuff would just take up more space.

Nothing contained in this advertisement constitutes legal advice and no attorney-client relationship is intended or implied.
_____________________________________________________________

The National Firearms Act (“NFA”) has special requirements for the ownership of Title II firearms, which include machine guns, sound suppressors, short-barreled shotguns, short-barreled rifles, destructive devices, and “any other weapon”.  There are different options available to those interested in purchasing a Title II firearm, including purchasing as an individual or through a trust or business entity such as a corporation or limited liability company.

The most beneficial of the foregoing options is an NFA Gun Trust.  An NFA Gun Trust is a legal instrument that provides Title II firearms collectors with certain estate planning benefits while also setting forth who will use, possess and maintain the firearms and for whose benefit they will be so maintained.  Gun Trusts have many benefits beyond those offered by other ownership options, including:

•	No fingerprint cards or photo identification required
•	Chief Law Enforcement Officer (CLEO) signature is not required
•	Continuity of ownership upon incapacitation or death
•	Several authorized users may be designated
•	Confidentiality and privacy in the ownership of the NFA assets

An NFA Gun Trust provides a means to protect owners of Title II weapons from inadvertent or constructive violation of the National Firearms Act, which regulates the transfer, possession, and ownership of Title II firearms.  The repercussions for violation of the NFA are quite serious, and can include: (i) a fine of up to $250,000, (ii) ten (10) years imprisonment, and (iii) the forfeiture of the weapon, as well as any vessel, vehicle, or aircraft used to conceal or convey the firearm. 

Protect your firearms, your family, and yourself from violations of the National Firearms Act with a professionally drafted NFA Gun Trust today.

Brand new in box with tags USGI unissued surplus. MENS 10” DESERT TAN WATERPROOF INSULATED LACE TO TOE FIELD BOOT, MATTERHORN CORCORAN MODEL 4949,  SERIOUS BOOTS FOR SERIOUS PROFESSIONALS. Proudly manufactured in the USA land of the free and the home of the brave by American workers. Corcoran® has earned the respect of military personnel over the years. 

From the “Original Jump Boot” that carried paratroopers behind enemy lines in Europe to the newest “Combat Boot” currently being worn in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Built using the best components available, the newest technology and comfort designs Corcoran® remains the brand of choice.



These Matterhorn/Corcoran Desert Tan Boots are solidly constructed with Fleshout Leather to provide a durable boot without sacrificing mobility. These boots have a reinforced steel eyelet lacing that will hold up in the most trying conditions. The outsole is an ultra-durable Vibram Sierra rubber that is attached to the boot with the patented Goodyear Flexwelt(tm). That means that the soles will hold up even after miles of road use and, in most circumstances, can be resoled to give an even greater level of usability. For a light but steady step, the Matterhorn Desert Tan Boots have a fiberglass shank. The outsole is non-marking, oil-resistant and slip-resistant, so they will carry you into any situation and safely back out again. 



The interior of the Matterhorn boot is a grunt's dream. Not only are they made with a guaranteed waterproof and breathable Gore-Tex bootie, but they are insulated with 200 gram Thinsulate insulation. These boots will keep your feet dry when you are quick-timing it through the mud and warm when you are standing guard in those cool desert nights. Thinsulate(tm) Insulation 200 grams is recommended for cool environments or where the wearer is producing a lot of body heat from activity. These Field Boots help to keep your feet dry from the perspiration that builds up from strenuous activity with a Cambrelle moisture wicking lining, which moves the sweat away from your feet. The Matterhorn has a removable DRYZ(r) Moisture/Odor-Control Shock Absorbing Cushioned Insert so your feet will feel relieved from the moment you try these great boots on. The comfort is enhanced by the patented PGD shock absorbing polyurethane midsole. 



Why spend $50.00 for a pair of boots made in China that will last a couple of years and can't be resoled, when you can spend a little extra and buy a pair of boots that will last you a lifetime and provide you the comfort and durability you deserve. You don't have to be in the military to enjoy these boots, they are excellent for camping, hiking, fishing and hunting.

Its greatest value comes from the features that have defined the M77 Mark II family of rifles for the last 20 years. 

With a one-piece bolt that has proven to be one of the strongest on the market, integral scope bases which can never shoot loose, and a diagonally angled forend screw that adds accuracy by securely pulling the barreled action down into the handsome, brown laminate stock for accurate shooting, the M77 Mark II Target rifle proves its value as a workhorse in the field and at the range.

No cash offers please.

 As title states, I have a LNIB Glock 19 Gen 3 for trade. I am looking for an M&P9, black,FDE,OD whatever you have. Prefer fullsize. I literally just bought this pistol a week ago from my LGS. I am not really liking it as much as I thought I would since I own a Glock 26 and 17. So I am wanting an M&P again. 

I have the receipt to prove it was just recently purchased for 515$+tax. It has only had 20 rounds of good defensive ammo through it. Not that round count really matters anyways. Obviously it is in perfect condition, could easily pass as brand NEW.

It has the box, paperwork/manual, lock, 2 15 round mags, loader etc. Everything a new one would come with. I would like your trade to be the same. REDACTED

I am able to meet in the evenings, or throughout the day if you come to me. This pistol is NOT FOR SALE. TRADE ONLY. If it is still listed I still have it.

I bought all of these parts brand new and had this rifle built with all the parts that matter. I put this rifle through a 60 round break in procedure the first time i had it out. It was primarily used as a hunting rifle and for some occasional target shooting. This rifle was thoroughly cleaned after each outing as every rifle should be, and has under 300 rounds through it total. I wrapped it in camo form self cling camouflage wrap (not sticky) to keep it scratch free and also to camouflage it for hunting. This is such an easy rifle to shoot accurately and  basically has no recoil at all. Very well taken care of one of a kind rifle. Buyer must sign a bill of sale, and the price is $3,000 cash only. Price reflects current market value and the parts used. Serious inquiries only please. Call me at an appropriate time please at (716) 725-two one six two"

I'm looking for an Ipad (at least 2nd gen) for my mom, the Galaxy Tab 10.1 was actually hers but she found it confusing. No one would trade an Ipad straight up for the tab so I would sweeten the deal with a GP WASR 10/63. I just need a rifle or shotgun in return, as the WASR is my only rifle. Rifle would just need to be in good condition and any caliber below 308. Shotgun also in good condition, 20 GA preferably.
Figure the value would be $200 for the Tab and $600 for the WASR for a total of $800
The Ipad 2 is about $400 and the rifle or shotty anywhere between $250-$400
Don't mind if I lose a little money, just want the Ipad for my mother's birthday coming up. 

The WASR is in excellent condition with only 60 rounds through it. Has a folding stock and G2 trigger. It has a sling and AR style flash hider. It comes with multiple extra wood stocks and fore-ends.
The Galaxy Tab is in great condition. It is 32GB and is running Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. Comes with everything from the factory, including the box and a black leather cover that turns into a stand.

http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/sig516-od-green.aspx

I've got an OD Green Sig Sauer 516 piston AR-15 w/ less that 125 round fired. This gun has been kept in a rifle case for the last few months and I've decided to sell it to fund another project. This gun comes with a AimPoint Micro T-1 (2MOA) installed on a LaRue tactical mount (tall) and comes with 5x 30 round magazines. (4 windowed P-Mags and 1 non-windowed P-Mag) This gun also comes with the Sig Sauer back up iron sights that came with the gun at purchase. This gun has an adjustable gas block for adverse conditions/suppressors etc.

This gun was shot one time at Colonial Shooting Academy and had 4x 30 rounds magazines fired through it for zero'ing (25 yard) purposes. Since then it's been wiped down with a silicone cloth and been stored in the bag.

This is my father's rifle so I'll be directing emails to him for response."
