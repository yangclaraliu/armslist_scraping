This gun is immaculate shape with one caveat (we’ll get to that in a minute). A couple minor safe dings in the stock, bluing is 100%. No rust or woods scrapes, I don’t think this thing has ever been hunted.  I replaced the sling studs so they’re fresh and rock solid. Has a Simmons expedition 3-9-40 scope mounted on see through rings. Comes with one blue and one stainless mag.

Here’s the caveat – the gun fires and is accurate. However, this thing has been a safe queen with a capital Q. from what I have read and what I understand talking to a lot of older rem guys is that the 742’s and a few other series were susceptible to chamber sticking if not cleaned properly before storage. As such, this one has trouble extracting brass. If you manually run the action, it will pull it out. When fired though, it sits in the chamber and the next round jams when it hits the back of the spent brass.

It is my belief that a good proper bore scrubbing and a swab of the gas tube would solve this issue and you’d have yourself a beautiful deer rifle. Or, buy a bunch of 10 round mags (under $20 I think…) and have yourself a poor man’s Garand. The little fella needs some TLC. I’ve had the full intention of taking it apart and cleaning it proper ever since I’ve owned it but guess what, I haven’t. I don’t see myself having the time even before THIS year’s deer season. So - I’m letting it go so someone else might get to enjoy it. If you have the elbow grease and the time, here’s your chance.

asking $375. Lower offers considered but don’t be surprised if I sit on it for a bit. i've seen plenty of these sitting on tables at gun shows with no glass for $450 in worse shape than this one

I don't have actual weights on them but I estimate the boy to be around 150 lbs and the girl at around 120 lbs, they are both LARGE dogs! I am rehoming them because I don't have enough time for them. I will not seperate, if you take one you must take both of them, they have never been split apart. They are very loyal, excellent guard dogs and dislike strangers.

Please before contacting me, research the breed, they are for experienced dog owners, you must have an alpha dog mentality. In Brazil these dogs were bred to be estate guardians, farm dogs and hunting dogs. You must be over 21 and provide a yard for them to run around in. Their shots expired, depending on the trade I could take them for their updated shots. Reply to this post if interested.

Swivel studs on each side of the forend if you want to mount a sling

I have the factory stock that will go with it as well. I am wanting to build another rifle, so this one must go. It is by far my favorite rifle, but one I must sell, cause it's worth the most, and i'd rather sell one gun at this time, vs 2, 3 or 4 guns. Not a scratch on it, it's my baby



I have about $1550 in this rifle, if I said she shot great, that would be a HUGE understatement..... I am looking for $975 cash FTF OBO!!!!

Used Once with NO signs of wear

Great for boating or any moving vehicle!!

Paid $ 1200 2yrs ago

Nikon's StabilEyes binocular provides the kind of stabilization needed for such high magnification. In benign conditions with 7 or 8x binoculars, it is relatively easy to get a large, steady image up close and personal. But as magnification increases, this becomes a more difficult task. Eventually the smaller field of view and more pronounced shake of a large optic can render big binoculars a very frustrating affair.

But no longer. The 16x32 StabilEyes provides 3° of stabilization in every direction, making them actually useful in such situations as tracking a moving subject while on a moving platform yourself. They're great for observing from airplanes, helicopters, boats, etc. And as a completely waterproofed unit, they can be used effectively anywhere.

56-72mm Interpupillary adjustment range
Rubber armored, waterproof & fogproof housing
±3° of all-direction motion compensation
Multicoatings on each air-to-glass surface for incredible brightness, resolution and color rendition
Automatic shut-off after one minute preserves battery life
No need to constantly push a button for stabilization effect

Six hours of battery life with just two 1.5-volt ""AA"" alkaline batteries

The GSG-5 is a semi-automatic rimfire rifle chambered for the .22 LR cartridge and is produced by German Sport Guns. In many ways, the GSG-5 is an exact replica of the Heckler & Koch MP-5 H&K MP5 sub-machinegun. 

Ergonomics and handling are identical to that of the MP 5 with an overall length of 33.5” and a weight of 6.6 pounds which makes it an ideal training tool for law enforcement, military personnel and civilians. 22 long rifles offer an immense savings over 9mm/40/45 caliber ammunition allowing extensive range time with the GSG-5 at a minimal cost to the user. 

Barrel length on the GSG-5 rifle is 16.25 inches including the faux suppressor which surpasses federal requirements, making it legal to own by anyone. The GSG-5 utilizes either a 22 or 10 rd detachable box magazine that releases with an H&K style paddle magazine release. The charging handle on the GSG-5 is located on the left side of the receiver and is non-reciprocating just like the H&K MP5 series. 

The GSG-5 comes standard with a conventional MP 5 style stock and forend but American Tactical Imports also offers several different style stocks and tactical forends including a side-folding stock like the H&K MP5k-PDW and a retractable stock as offered on the H&K MP5A3. The GSG-5 comes with a standard H&K style forend but is upgradeable to a tactical railed forend that accepts tactical grips, lights and lasers.

The GSG-5 utilizes the H&K style drum sight, which can be adjusted for both windage and elevation. Accessories available for the GSG-5 include a claw mount with Picatinny rail allowing just about any optic from a tactical or hunting scope to a close quarters battle optic like a red dot sight to be mounted on the receiver. In addition to extra magazines ATI also offers a tactical magazine coupler for joining two magazines together, making for a faster reload. American Tactical Imports also offers an MP 5 SD style barrel/faux suppressor, which looks exactly like the original. Whether you are looking for a low cost tactical trainer or a fun plinker the GSG-5 rifle is a winning choice. 

In 2009, H&K instituted a lawsuit against both German Sport Guns and American Tactical Imports, Inc., over trade dress infringements. The lawsuit was settled in October of 2009, and resulted in the production and importation of the original GSG-5 design to cease as of Oct. 8, 2009. The remaining stocks will continue to be sold until January 31, 2010, at which time all sales of the GSG-5 by American Tactical Imports must be concluded."

I don't have actual weights on them but I estimate the boy to be around 150 lbs and the girl at around 120 lbs, they are both LARGE dogs! I am rehoming them because I don't have enough time for them. I will not seperate, if you take one you must take both of them, they have never been split apart. They are very loyal, excellent guard dogs and dislike strangers.

Please before contacting me, research the breed, they are for experienced dog owners, you must have an alpha dog mentality. In Brazil these dogs were bred to be estate guardians, farm dogs and hunting dogs. You must be over 21 and provide a yard for them to run around in. Their shots expired, depending on the trade I could take them for their updated shots. Reply to this post if interested. Located in Melbourne, FL.

Trijicon ACOG/Green Chevron Illuminate Reticle/Flattop Mount/Matte Finish

The ACOGs are internally adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using fiber optics which collect ambient light. The ACOG combines traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close in aiming speed. Although the ACOG has many features which are very advantageous for military use, they were developed by Trijicon without government funding. Designed for use with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions -- without failure prone batteries.

The 4th Generation Glock brings revolutionary design changes to the world's most popular pistol. Externally, what is immediately apparent is the multiple backstrap design of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to small, medium, and large frame hands. The surface of the frame is the Generation 4 Rough Textured Frame. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed shooters. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment.

Haven't had a chance to fire it, but it feeds fine just running ammo through it by working the slide, and it dry fires fine.

It was made in West Germany, so that means it is much rarer than your average P226. 

Comes with 2 magazines, 2 sets of grips, and a hard case.

To make this pistol importable and to be sold in the U.S. the butt stock has been welded shut, therefore this firearm is categorized as a pistol by the BATF. It also has a chrome lined barrel and upgraded firing pin from the factory. This fires a 7.62x25 (powerful round for its size). There is nothing wrong with this gun, it's just not what I want, it works great as it is only a month and a half old and was ordered new and I do know it only sells for 360 to 425 only, for those who have emailed me."

The FS2000 carbine is gas-operated and uses a rotating bolt lockup for reliability and greater accuracy. Its 17.44"" cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel is fitted with a muzzle brake. Fired cases are ejected through a forward port away from the operator. The olive drab thumbhole design polymer stock is ambidextrous.

First I have a 300 Weatherby Mag.  This rifle is brand new not a round down the tube.  It has just been sitting in the safe and I have plenty of other large caliber rifles for moose, bear, caribou, deer, elk, bison and whatever else I hunt in AK and AZ.  It is blued with composite stock.  24"" barrel, Fully adjustable trigger, guaranteed to shoot 1.5"" (or less) group at 100 yards.  1 in 10 rifling and has a fluted bolt.  This one will come with a Zeiss 3-9X40mm Scope.  I have not had the scope mounted.  This set up is over $2,000 new.  I am asking 1300.00.  This is like getting a deal on the rifle and getting a high end scope for free.
I am also bringing a Savage 30.06.  This rifle is in good shape and has a scope as well.  I don't remember what scope it has on it.  This rifle has the accutrigger and it is adjustable too.  Wood stock and dropped a caribou at 275 yards.  I would like to get about $400 for it but will consider offers for this one.
I will be in town the 25th.  I will post more pics when I get home from work on the 20th.   I just bought a house and could use the extra $$ nfor some stuff for the house.  NO TRADES so don't ask.  Keep an eye out I will likely be putting some more weapons on the list.  I don't remember what I have in the safe that I might want to part with.  I will update this add and post more pics when I get home from work.  Feel free to call if you have any questions.
Hey how about this -- $1500.00 and you can have both -- Pay retail for the Weatherby and get a high end scope and the scoped 30.06 for free??  Waht a deal!!!

With this mosquito and some mini mags I group 2-2.5 inches at 25 yards and I am by no means a great shot!! I bought this gun to introduce my wife to shooting as the slide is very easy to manipulate even with small female hands. It has been a nice little weapon, but my wife has moved on and I just won't take a pink gun to the range myself. It comes with two mags, the case, all the origional paperwork  and the lock.

As always, make sure this knife is legal for your area and you can own an auto knife before buying. Basically anyone can legally own an automatic knife(In TN at least), but not everyone can carry one.  To the best of my knowledge, this is limited to LEO, military and EMS.  I just don't want anyone to get into trouble.

Included are two magazines (rounds for one) and a holster. 

Was purchased from a former DPD officer and shows minor holster wear but no major scratches or damage. Personally, I've only taken it to the range a couple of times and fired around 200 rounds through it. 

Shoots accurately and didn't have a single jam or difficulty with any type of round, these models are known as VERY RELIABLE pistols and are sought after because of this reason. 

I'm negotiable on the price, just need to get back as close to what I have invested as possible. Will also consider trades for other firearms or other items. FTF transaction in or around the East Dallas area. I travel all over DFW for work so arranging a meeting shouldn't be difficult.

This is a Winchester Ranger lever action rifle in 30-30.  This rifle has a seven shot capacity, 6+1.  The wood stock and forend are in excellent condition.  The finish on the metal is superb.  This rifle has a very low round count and the physical appearence reflects this.  The action is crisp and smooth.  Never a hesitation in cycling rounds.  The 30-30 cartridge is impressive and this rifle really handles it perfectly.

The rifle is being traded or sold with 10 boxes of new Remington and Winchester ammunition.  These are 20 round boxes and I have over $160 invested in this ammunition alone.

The rifle with ammunition would be a good buy for $550, but I will sell for $450.  I would prefer trade.

I also have my NEF/HR 12ga Pardner Pump protector.  This is a Remington 870 patteern.  All tactical accessories are the same as the 870.  This is a 18.5"" barrel, chambered 2 3/4 & 3"".  Smooth bore.  I am including a pistol grip which can be used instead of the shoulder stock if desired.  Sling swivels and sling, factory box and papers.  $200

I would like to trade all of the above listed items for a tactical type 12ga like a Rem 1100 tac 4, Rem 1187 sp, Mossberg 935 or 930, Benelli M1, HK, FN.  I will drive for a good trade.

I am willing to trade down per value.  I will trade either alone for a Rem 870 in the configuration I need.  

I would trade my shotgun + $200 for a good 870.  I can add up to $200 on any trade for level deal.

I need the shotgun trade, but am open to offers from interested parties.  I may like your AR, AK, 9mm, .45, good coyote rifle, etc..."

The SportDOG FieldTrainer SD-400S is specially designed for tougher, more stubborn dogs. The SD-400S is ideal for training in the yard, field, or for hunting with close-working dogs that require a slightly higher stimulation collar.

Both the transmitter and receiver are waterproof and submersible. The 400S can be expanded to control up to three dogs by adding SportDOG Brand Add-A-Dog collars. The comfortable ""soft coat"" transmitter finish makes this unit a pleasure to handle. This is dog training gear the way you would design it.

The SportDOG Field-Trainer SD-400S is an incredibly versatile training collar and is specially designed for tougher, more stubborn dogs.

You can customize your SportDOG SD-400S to match your training preference. It comes set up in MODE-1 (an 8-level continuous + 8-level momentary stimulation one dog collar), but it can easily be changed into 7 different modes with different button configurations.

This allows you to customize your transmitter to your training needs. You are also able to transform your one dog system into a two dog unit with the ""Add-A-Dog"" feature and using the toggle switch."
