This pistol shows very little holster wear, and very little wear on the internal parts. The bore is bright and clean. This is a great shooter, light and slim, easy for any size hands, great for teaching new shooters or keeping costs down with 9mm ammunition. This is a ""numbers matching"" P6, meaning the barrel, slide and frame are all factory original. This P6 will come with two factory Sig Sauer magazines (8 rounds). Sig Sauer pistols have that to hell and back reliability and this pistol is no different. Read the P6 and P225 reviews and see for yourself. I am trading because I'm just ready for a change.

The initial takeup is around 2lbs and it breaks nicely.
The total round count on this is around 500.  I bought this thinking that it would replace my Glock 34, but I just can’t get used to the “normal” grip angle of anything other than a Glock.  Sad story, because this gun fits better in my hands better than any other gun I’ve ever tried.   The grip is very customizable.
Included with the gun is everything that comes stock from the factory:
-P30LS V1 Light LEM
-S/M/L side panels and backstraps
-Carrying Case
-Factory test casing
-HK Lock
-2 Magazines
-Factory Night Sights

A favorite among Benelli shotguns, the Benelli Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.
The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech® system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that’s more than a pound less! The ComforTech® system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest shooting and most reliable shotgun ever."

Internals/metal are in excellent shape. Bolt functions like it should, and there has been no cutting or bubba type shenanigans anywhere. This gun is stock.
The wood has some dings in it, but they're minor and could be cleaned up if someone was so inclined. I didn't want to alter this rifle in any way, so I haven't tried.

These were made in the 50's and 60's by Egypt using machines that originally made the Swedish AG-42, which is similar in action but a different caliber.
These rifles were some of the first direct impingement battle rifles. Only 70,000 or so were ever made, and of that only a couple thousand were imported into the US. They have an adjustable gas system, excellent muzzle break system, and are fed by 10 round detachable box magazines.

Bore is probably good to very good, and crown is perfect. This rifle hasn't been shot in years, but it functioned flawlessly using yugo fmj ammo. It doesn't do so well with soft points.

Internals/metal are in excellent shape. Bolt functions like it should, and there has been no cutting or bubba type shenanigans anywhere. This gun is stock.
The wood has some dings in it, but they're minor and could be cleaned up if someone was so inclined. I didn't want to alter this rifle in any way, so I haven't tried.

These were made in the 50's and 60's by Egypt using machines that originally made the Swedish AG-42, which is similar in action but a different caliber.
These rifles were some of the first direct impingement battle rifles. Only 70,000 or so were ever made, and of that only a couple thousand were imported into the US. They have an adjustable gas system, excellent muzzle break system, and are fed by 10 round detachable box magazines.

Bore is probably good to very good, and crown is perfect. This rifle hasn't been shot in years, but it functioned flawlessly using yugo fmj ammo. It doesn't do so well with soft points.

I'd like to do a face to face transfer at a local gun shop in Ventura or Oxnard or another of your choosing. I originally wanted a long range (400ish yards) coyote rifle based off the AR platform to go coyote hunting and something cool to take to the rifle range. Since building it 9 months ago I've lost interest in that dream and would rather have other firearms and money in the pocket. Another important note since building it 9 months ago is that it has never been fired, never even a round chambered.

Honestly its a great rifle and the only thing I personally would change is the trigger guard to a Magpul enhanced guard instead of the standard straight metal one. I really like the 2-stage trigger and am going to order another for my other AR. I'd like to see $1550 for the whole set, buyer pays all applicable FFL/DROS/CA/taxes/fees. I'll drop the price $100 if you don't want the glass, but it has great clarity despite the low price tag. I'm also willing to sell just the upper (and hopefully buttstock) for the right price and use the remaining parts in my other AR builds.

first is a mossberg 500 special purpose 12 gauge. cost $450 at Big R it has flat black phosphate and parkerized finish which is in 99%
it has the 18.5"" thick walled heavy barrel. not the thin crap they put on the persuaders. it originally had the ati 6 position stock mossberg has been putting on their guns but i switched it to a comb stock and had it stippled for better grip(the stippled surface feels like 100 grit sandpaper) it has the mossberg hand strap forend which has been stippled as well. the only other modifications are heavier duty springs upgraded firing pin and extractors and a heavier duty 590a1 magazine spring and follower.

second is a DeWalt cordless 7.2 volt screwdriver. it has 2 batterys one has never had a charge on it. battery charger. hard case, and all the bits i have to go with it. i paid just a hair over $225 on sale at sears a couple months ago not including the price of bits , it has only been used maybe 40 minutes total.  heres the link below to the tool on sears.

It is a WASR-10, but an earlier import before they started sucking. Sights are aligned, almost no trigger slap, all mags seat and feed very well. Trigger feels great, so much better then the newer ones. It features a nickle boron finish all around, inside and out. This is more corrosion resistant then the standard finish, and also creates less friction making the gun run a little better. Great for shooting corrosive ammo, so much easier to clean with this finish. Wood has been died black. US Palm grip was also added. Muzzle brake is genuine Bulgarian AK74 brake, NOT fake American versions that don't work. Muzzle is threaded, brake not pressed or pinned on.

Also included (but not pictured) is a top rail that fits over the dust cover. It replaces the rear sight, and mounts over the dust cover to the rear of the receiver. It holds zero perfect, and includes a rear peep sight similar to AR15. Rail hinges on stock rear sight mount to flip up and out of the way of the dust cover when you want to remove it. Perfect for mounting any optics, it's not as high up as the side rail mounts, so you can still get a good cheekweld with it. If using a micro red dot (like Aimpoint Micro) you can cowitness with the irons.

I also have 6 steel surplus 30 round magazines, and 400 rounds of ammo, some loose, some loaded in mags, some still sealed in boxes. All Yugo surplus, brass cased. Good stuff.

This is a real slick shooter, would like to keep it but have another project to fund. Sling pictured is not included.

This comes with a ""ulti-full"" turkey choke. Each and every component of the 835® was designed and tested around the demanding requirements of high-power 3 1/2"" 12 gauge magnum ammo. Unlike other new-comers to this specialized market, who just modified their existing 2 3/4"" -3"" shotguns, the 835® was designed to stay the course. The robust bolt, receiver, and other components are specifically sized for the longer shells and the downrange punishment they dish out. In addition the 835 barrels are overbored to 10 gauge bore dimensions. This reduces recoil and produces exceptional uniform patterns with light and heavy loads. There is also 8 strategically placed ports in both sides of the barrel to reduce felt recoil and make a second quick shot recovery. This would make a great Turkey gun for the season."
