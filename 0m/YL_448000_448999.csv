We are truly a nation of idiots …","WA, Seattle, Washington",$ 30,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 26, 2012",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://hadafewbeers.com/2012/06/25/karen-klein-fails-to-do-job-gets-rich-sgt-1st-class-taylor-does-job-gets-screwed-we-are-truely-a-nation-of-idiots/

Karen Klein is rich and we’re idiots.

This is going to be a two-part update.  Not two part as in I post one now and the other whenever I feel like it but rather a two part in that the first portion will be about me wondering what the fuck is wrong with America and the second part will be about me wondering what the fuck is wrong with America.

Look it’s about two different people okay.

Karen Klein, chances are by now you’ve seen the video and read about America’s outpouring of support for the grandmother who was viciously verbally assaulted by, wait for it, 12-year-olds.   Some reports now put donations at over half a million dollars because ‘grandma’ didn’t do her fucking job.

That’s right, it was her job to control the 30 or so 12-year-olds.  She failed and you all collectively said, “OH MY GOD THAT’S SO SAD!” and then gave her $20 a piece.     You’re pathetic (assuming you gave her a dime that is) and she’s pathetic.

Look, I don’t have kids so if you want to close the browser and yell out “well he just doesn’t know’ now that’s fine.  That aside I can easily think of three VERY simple things that would’ve resolved the situation quickly.

1: Kids listen up, ONE more word and this bus goes back to the school where I’ll have the principal call each and every one of your parents.

2:  Hold up your own phone (don’t have one Grams?  That was kind of dumb) and announce “this is all being recorded, unless this behavior stops right now I’m turning it over to (insert authority figure here).

3: Sucker punch the next 12-year-old that opens his or her mouth.  Yeah, yeah that’s bad but I’d have contributed to her defense fund then because that would have been HYSTERICAL!

What fun and ham fisted that was but the point is 12-year-olds are idiots, they are.  Have you listened to Justin Bieber, resolved, 12-year-olds are fucking retarded.  If you can’t outsmart one of them (even after having raised your own hoard) then what the fuck are you doing on that bus?

You baby boomers make me sick.  Would your parents have put up with that shit?  Hell no they were the greatest generation, more concerned with killing Nazis and cranking the bombing making technology up to 11.

We collectively make me sick, instead of asking ourselves how a grown woman let that happen (they’re fucking 12 remember) we opened our hearts and wallets cause ‘those kids were mean.”  There are also reports of the kids and their parents being harassed, fight bullying with bullying I guess.

And what does Karen plan to do with her half a million (besides take ‘the vacation of a lifetime’ for fuck’s sake)?  She plans to keep doing the job she absolutely sucks at.

Sgt. 1st Class Taylor is poor, we’re still idiots.

Now I’d like to turn your attention to Sgt. 1st Class Walter Taylor, who had to make a life or death decision in literal seconds.   While on patrol in Afghanistan, after his unit (a unit that was designed to find IEDs) encountered the worst road-side bomb of their tour, came under small-arms fire.   During the ensuing fire fight a black sedan drove into the battle, something that is unheard of for a civilian vehicle.    Couple that with the fact that his unit has just been briefed about the possibilities of suicide vehicle borne bombs and what happen next barely registers on my radar above the level of “unfortunate but understandable”.

After the gunfight, while following a wire used to detonate the bomb (a wire which seemed to lead up to the black sedan) Taylor came within 10 meters of the vehicle when a figure leapt from the rear passenger door and moved toward the trunk of the vehicle.    Taylor did what you or I or anyone else would do in that situation, he fired his weapon but subsequently discovered he’d killed an innocent person.

So of course Taylor faces charges of negligent homicide and dereliction of duty under the uniform code of military justice because … well I don’t know the because here, I just know it’s the reality.

I’ve sat though a lot of court marshals probably 20 or so.  Ninety-nine percent of the time the accused on the stand is guilty as sin. This, in my opinion, wasn’t one of them.   His stellar career, really it is a stellar career, aside what did the Army want this platoon sergeant to do, die to prove a point?   Had he had the time to logically think it through, say space aliens paused everyone but him, the choice was kill the civilian or let myself and my platoon members (there were three others with him) die.

When a platoon deploys to a war zone, and I know this as fact, they become family.   More than family in some ways, the bond runs deeper than family, family isn’t facing death every day, every minute, every second.  His platoon was in, what few would argue, the worst stretch of road in Afghanistan with orders to find all the road-side bombs and Oh, by the way, we now believe there are now suicide vehicle bombs as well so umm, good luck out there.

I’ll take she’s dies for $1,000 Alex and I’ll need that money because a civilian attorney is expensive.

Here’s the point, he hired a civilian lawyer rather than run the risk of being assigned a military one that passed the bar last night and has argued two cases.  Not a dumb move by anyone’s standard.

So here’s where I ask you all to do, go to this site and donate $20, or $50 or even $100, whatever you can do.   I did it, you’ll notice they’re woefully short of their humble $35,000 goal (having raised a whopping $1,180 as of this blog post) yet Karen, dear Karen gets the vacation of her dreams and half a million.

Did I mention that just a few short weeks later Taylor was hit in the face by RPG shrapnel?  He’s, and I’ve met him, disfigured and blind in one eye.  Yeah he’s got that going for him too.

Finally, look I love it when you all share this blog on FB or retweet it … I absolutely love it.  It tickles my ‘narcissistic’ button like nothing else can.  But this time I’m asking, begging, cut the part about Karen if you feel the need but repost this.   Taylor deserves half a million but needs $35,000.

Donate however much you can. If you have no money to give then all I ask is that you PASS THIS ON IN ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM. Be it Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, etc. etc. We need to support our troops.

Second, to the guy who spoke with police:  you are wrong, the police who told you that were wrong.  It shouldn't be surprising to you or anyone that Chicago police are notoriously ignorant of firearm laws.  I still meet cops who think its still completely illegal to own firearms in Chicago.  If your theory was true it would be the responsibility of every gun store that ever sold a gun to a Chicago resident to make sure they follow local ordinances...  I promise you it's not.  It is the responsibility of the buyer to comply with local laws that affect them.  That is why a chicago resident can go into any gun shop and buy and legally buy an ar-15, because the law only applies in COOK county.  This is why many gun ranges allow you to rent a locker to store firearms they own that may not be legal to possess within cook county."

It is a metal framed gun. It has a left sided thumb safety. When you insert a loaded magazine and rack the slide to chamber a round, the hammer will be in the de-cocked position. The thumb safety's engagement blocks the firing pin and fully disconnects the trigger from the firing mechanism. Disengaging the thumb safety makes the gun ready to fire double action, and each shot after the hammer will be automatically cocked by virtue of the slide's rearward travel during the previous shot, or you can (after disengaging the thumb safety) cock the hammer and have a single action first shot. The gun also has a magazine disconnect, so if the magazine is out, it WILL NOT FIRE. I am currently using this gun at work as a duty weapon. I just had it cleaned by a gunsmith last week. It comes with the follwing:

1 FOBUS Paddle Holster

3 Factory 11 round magazines

1 Hogue rubber grip

I have ammo to trade with it if I trade for a different caliber handgun, I already have a 9mm so I am looking to stay with .40 or move up to .45, but will consider all trades of any caliber. The ammo I have to trade are these:

1 20 Round box of Hornady ZOMBIE MAX rounds ( EXACT same round as the CRITICAL DEFENSE WITH FTX BULLET) just the ZOMBIE name and green tip instead of red. 

1 50 Round box of FEDERAL Classic Jacketed Hollowpoint Rounds.

I also have some .22LR ammo i can throw in. Offer me something and we'll make a deal.

This is a customized Beretta 8040 Law Enforcement (LE) .40 Cal Dual Action Only (DAO)

This is before Stoeger bought Beretta. Have original cardboard box with matching serial number, manual, plastic case and lock.
I bought it from an older gentleman and i just never got around to shooting it. Was sent to Robar and had a complete roguard exterior finish w/NP3 finish and all internal parts done as well. Has had a competition trigger job done with the hammer smoothed. Trigger pull is as smooth and easy as a colt python. Also had Trijicon night sights put on and have originals in the case. I am selling for less than what i have in it.

Here is the website to Robar that did the work:
http://www.robarguns.com/


Also included is a nylon holster and box of 50 rounds that i bought and never used. 

I am not in a hurry to sell but it is just sitting in my safe and figured i would see if anyone is looking for a real nice gun. 
I can email more photos if requested. 

I am open to Reasonable trades for gold, silver. Thanks for looking.

This is a Century Arms GP1975 sporter bullpup that has had about 250 rounds through it. It functions well and the sights are aligned, not canted like some of century's WASRs. It hurts me to sell this as it is one fun gun to take to the range and draws everyones attention.
I will include 2 Tapco 20 round mags and a Bulldog case.
Sorry for the out of focus pics. I need a new camera. The only mark on it are really the one that the safety makes and maybe one or 2 very minor scratches from moving around my safe. You really need a bright light to see them.
You can heavily modify these by 1. taking the front handguard off and adding a trirail to the barrel (~$15) 2. adding a scope mount to the top.
I was intending to do this but ran into financial difficulties.
Will take $550 cash firm or roughly $600 trade value.
Spent about $700 on the whole set up.

I am mainly looking for cash but may consider trades for semi auto pistols such as glocks or a beretta. I may consider other trades too especially tactical styled firearms. Worst I can do is politely decline."

Very nice 1943 / 1944 Spanish Airforce Mauser rifle in caliber 8mm Mauser. Very nice collectable and shootable condition. Great Spanish Airforce crest on receiver, no importers markings, all matching except for bolt (these were frequently changed in the armory when rifles were serviced or refurbished). No splits or cracks in wood, just some minor handling and storage dings. About 80% to 90% original arsenal finish, bright bore, mechanically excellent. Includes bayonet that fits perfectly, but not original to this rifle. Still, looks great for display. Missing cleaning rod, but any Mauser cleaning rod will work as replacement for display. Shoots great and includes 74 rounds of surplus ammunition. Ammo is sure fire good ammo, but corrosive like most military ammo, so clean the rifle after you use it. A great addition to any collection, and ready to take to the range or you're next hunting trip! $250. or will consider trade for either quality .22 pistol or 9mm compact pistol or ?"

 Walther PPS is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses modified Browning type locking with tilting barrel. Frame of the gun is made from impact resistant polymer. Trigger is of double action only type, striker fired, with pre-cocked striker system, similar to QA system used in Walther P99 pistols. This system requires a manual recocking (by partial slide retraction) in the case of misfire. Gun is fitted with automated trigger safety and firing pin block; additional ""storage type"" safety is provided by removable backstrap of the grip; once backstrap is removed, the firing pin is automatically decocked and gun is blocked until the backstrap is reinstalled. This patented system is called QuickSafe by Walther. Sights are low profile, with rear sight adjustable for windage."

The P30 is one of the most advanced police pistols of all time. During it's development the most important requirements were flexibility, functionality and safety. Ergonomics of the grip have been improved by interchangeable backstraps and side panel inserts. In combination with the ambidextrous operating controls, this pistol can be individually adapted to almost any user. The P30L (for Long), has a slide and barrel that measure approximately a half-inch longer in length. Otherwise the P30L is essentially identical to the P30. No compromises have been made regarding safety. The P30L V3 has a traditional double action/single action trigger system with a decocking button at the rear of the slide and a firing pin block safety that eliminate the need for a manual safety. Its advanced loaded chamber indicator, which is easily seen and felt, positively indicates a loaded chamber. Another feature is the SuperLuminova 3-dot sights with non-tritium luminous dots, allowing an exact target acquisition even under poor lighting conditions."

This is an early model, low serial number S&W M&P 15-22 with MANY accessories and upgrades. I am not interested in selling this rifle, just trading. The only things I’m interested in trading this rifle for is an AR- style 9MM pistol that I can turn into an SBR (so no Kel Tec or Sig’s please), or a 16” 9MM rifle. I am also interested in an 5.56 or .223 AR style pistol or rifle.

The rifle is in good overall shape with minor wear. The rounds count is about 1200-1500 rounds and it fires FLAWLESSLY. All the springs were upgraded early in its life by S&W as per S&W’s instructions. It loves all types of .22 ammo so it will eat whatever you feed it. :)

•S&W M&P 15-22 rifle $450
oUpgraded trigger and bolt springs
oFive position collapsible stock
oOriginal box

This is a sweet gun. Original box and papers. All the extra weight from the unfluted cylinder and full lug make this a pussycat even with hot loads. Lock up on the gun is tight. Action is smooth. Single action is light and crisp. Finish is good. The gun would have been shipped with Hogue grips. The handgun currently wears custom wood stocks. 

Local transactions must be completed in my shop. This is a consignment gun. I will ship to your FFL if you are located a distance away. 

Asking $900 or best offer and will consider full or partial trades. Trades considered but not limited to firearms, reloading equipment, tools, recreational vehicles, jeep or tractor parts."

 These are....er; were made by the ""Legend""ary Polytech '386' Arsenal, and were Imported in the early 90's. 
 It is totally Original, with a Chrome Bolt/ Chrome Lined 20"" Barrel / & the flip-up Short Range/Long Range sights (which I find quicker & easier to use than the standard military AK sights)/ ALL Chinese AK Parts...Nothing replaced for 992r compliance (or needs to be in this configuration, unless you'd like to build a Galil Clone or something!)/ And of course a very solid Milled Receiver!

 I consider these to be a 'Sleeper' AK variant, as many people are looking for a 'Real AK' with 'Evil Features'....If you think a WASR-10 is a real AK- OK? But if you want Pure Polytech-Knowledgey; something  any real AK collector can appreciate, that's your choice too. 
As far as I can tell, ya can't get it wrong with any ALL FACTORY Imported AK.
Which means original older guns....Of course there are a lot of fine AK builders out there- and if you are one: Then ya know that. And also, that quality originals are getting scarce.

 The Norinco 'Hunter'- while primarily designed for hunting (Big Surprise!), still takes any regular Hi-Cap AK Mag/Drums and makes a good medium-range range gun,  & can still handle all of your Heavy Duty Plinking needs.
 So if you're a Hunter, and have been hunting for an AK, (with all the 'Evil', but none of it's features)- Perhaps you've been hunting for a Norinco 'Hunter'.

 I'd really prefer to deal locally (near OKC): And am interested in trading for an STI Spartan 1911, or better yet, a Kel-Tec PLR-16.....Or silver, or maybe an old S&W Revolver. Trades can be 'adjusted' accordingly.
 This rifle is in really great condition, & doesn't have any Bubbanizations. Comes with one 30 rnd. mag, at least."

The GI model is designed with slightly looser tolerances to accommodate all the crappy .308/762x51mm you get for cheap or steal from the range. The SN on this rifle is well outside the range of ""defects"" that PTR let out (those rifles are SNs 0001-0250), and when headspaced at the store it was at .333mm. After firing and cleaned it was at .25mm, well within acceptable boundaries. The rollers are those that all PTRs come with, and oversized rollers WILL NOT be necessary until your round count is at least in the 5000s, if that.

I've fired 120 rounds of Lake City M80 reloads (VERY clean-shooting), 40+ rounds of Silver Bear, and 40 rounds of Wolf. Never any FTF, FTE, malfunctions, etc. Shoots reasonably accurate--especially as advertised. I think my best was actually from the Silver Bear (2 inch group at a hundred yards from a bench)

I have 9 20rd magazines total for it, 1 PTR-91 Inc mag, and 8 West German surplus aluminum mags that have been cleaned of cosmoline and have no rust on the followers. 

The DMS-1/mount is optional, it's a damn good 1-4x scope and I could use it on any of my other guns. If you want it without the optic then I'll bring it down to 950.

I will accept cash or discrete PayPal. Obviously, must have proof of existence on this planet and be willing to sign a receipt. 

Will trade for: Imbel or DSA FAL build--not preferential to model. No Imbels on an Enterprise receiver though, thanks. Or, if you have an Arsenal-assembled AK, I'd look into it, as I'm sitting on WAY too much 5.45mm at the moment."

Here I have several Aimpoint CompM4 Scopes for sale.
All come in box with matching serial numbers.
Screws, Rail, Clamp and everything shown in pictures is included.

AIMPOINT COMPM4S WITH QRP2 MNT & ARD 

This design, designated as the CompM4s, features a low-mounted battery compartment giving the sight a lower overall profile, and placing the switch and battery compartment in a more protected position while preserving all of the outstanding features of the standard CompM4 sight. 

The electronic components in the CompM4 include Aimpoint’s Super ACET diode circuitry, allowing the sight to run constantly for up to 8 years on a single AA battery. All CompM4 sights feature an internal voltage regulator that allows the sights to operate on any AA size battery available worldwide. 

These sights also feature a 2 minute-of-angle (MOA) dot size, making them perfectly suited for use with Aimpoint’s 3XMagnifier and Concealed Engagement Unit (CEU). 

The CompM4 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices, and features an extremely rugged and easy to use 16-position manual switch with 7 night vision compatible settings and 9 daylight settings. The CompM4 sight body is designed to protect the optical and electronic components inside against hard use, and keeps the sight waterproof to 45 meters (150 feet). 

Features:
• Compatible with every generation of Night Vision Devices (NVD) 
• Super ACET technology allows up to 80,000 hours (over 8 years) of daytime operation on one AA battery 
• Internal voltage regulator allows the CompM4 to be used with any AA size battery. 
• Seven night vision compatible settings and 9 daylight settings
• QRP2 mount has twice the clamping force of the original QRP, and the mounting knob is wider and shorter to improve operation, and lessen the chance of becoming snagged on other gear. 
• Mount base is “keyed” into to the body of the sight to absorb recoil. 
• Mount base screws directly into the sight – no separate sight ring is required. 
• 500,000 hours of use on NVD setting 
• 2 MOA dot for close combat and long distance engagement
• Matches perfectly with Aimpoint 3XMag, (magnifier module). 
• Unequalled light transmission. 
• Front lens opening is threaded for addition of killFlash anti-reflective device. 
• Submersible to 150 feet (45 meters) 
• Vertical spacer included
• Standardized as the US Army’s new M68CCO 
• Improved adjustment caps are easier to remove, and are protected against impact. 
• Can be used with a carry handle adaptor

I bought it mainly because it was just a clone to the .50 Cal I was shooting, so easy to hold and honestly just a cool looking little muzzleloader.  I have put many .50 Cal kits together and this is not a kit.  I did break the wooden ram rod when hunting, so I bought a fiberglass ram rod that works so much better.
I have seen a few internet threads where collectors like this gun. It is in good condition. It has a small scratch on the butt plate. However, it's in fine shape other than that.

ATI stock #MRW4100, ATI shell holder, ATI heatshield, Solarforce tactical strobe flashlight, scabbard, boresnake, and 316 rounds of mixed 12 gauge ammo. Has about 80 rounds through it. In excellent condition, minus a bit of rusting on the heatshield (which can be seen in the one photo) from me being an idiot and forgetting to plug in the dehumidifier in the safe. No rust on the gun itself at all.

The ammo included is as follows:
Winchester Supreme Elite PDX1 2 3/4"" 1oz rifled slug with 3 00 buck pellets- 4 rounds
Copper-Matrix 2 3/4"" 7/8oz slugs- 9 rounds
Remington Slugger 2 3/4"" 1oz slugs- 59 rounds
Remington Buckshot 2 3/4"" 00 buck 9 pellets- 50 rounds
Remington Express Magnum Buckshot 3"" 00 buck 15 pellets- 55 rounds
Fiocchi Exacta Buckshot 2 3/4"" 00 buck 9 pellets- 30 rounds
Federal Power-Shok 2 3/4"" #4 buck 34 pellets- 70 rounds
Winchester Universal 2 3/4"" 7 1/2 pellets- 39 rounds

I'm looking at trading for a decent AK-47 chambered in 7.62x39. I have $200 cash that I could also throw in if needed for the right rifle. If I do need to throw in all my cash to make a deal happen, then the rifle needs to have at least 1 magazine and some ammo.

I live in SEPA and would be willing to drive a bit if necessary. FTF transaction with valid PA DL and Bill of Sale required. I don't have a LTCF, so if that's your personal requirement, then feel free to move on.

If you have any questions or are interested in making a trade happen, then message me. Thanks."
