This is a legitimate classified. Pictures are of actual firearm.

Up for sale or trade is perhaps the most incredible lead accelerating device ever conceived by the race of men. Capable of firing literally hundreds of lead balls at a target with just one squeeze of the trigger, this
 Mossberg 500 is unmatched in lethality. This particular shotgun is the weapon of choice for elite operatives such as the Navy SEALs, FBI, Optimus Prime, John Dillinger, Former president Abraham Lincoln, and Buzz Lightyear.

But don't believe me, see for yourselves! 

Legend states that this shotgun was created by Zeus in order to defeat the titans, but was hidden away on Earth becuase its power was too great even for Gods to weild. After centuries of lying dormant, the gun was recovered by archaeologist Indiana Jones' brother Larry. Larry then tried to have this historical artifact preserved forever in the Smithsonian Institution but his drinking problem got the better of him and he sold it for a quick buck to Batman. Batman initially wanted a leg up on the criminals of Gotham city but soon feared that it would be too effective at fighting crime and would put him out of a job. He then presumably abandoned it in an Academy Sports and Outdoors in Tulsa, Oklahoma where I would later purchase it in 2009.

The president once asked me to loan it to SEAL team 6, so naturally I agreed. Two weeks later it was returned to me and apparently was used to kill Osama Bin Laden, however the awesome-field created by the muzzle blast caused one of their insert helicopters to crash. Shortly afterwards SEAL team 6 went back in time with it and shot Hitler before he could commit suicide. I guess they just needed new material for all of the books written by former Navy SEALs.

The burden of its legacy has become too much for me, a mere mortal to bear. Even with its ability to grant its owner extreme handsomeness and eternal youth I feel that it is time for me to relinquish my hold over this precious artifact.

This divine tool of justice is equipped with the following features:

Barrel
Trigger
Metal
Plastic
3 stocks: Pistol grip stock (pictured), pistol grip only, and traditional stock. All black polymer.
Ventilated heatshield
Tac-star shell saddle
Did I say barrel?
Fiber optic front sight
More metal

This gun is in great shape for having lasted thousands of years in and undisturbed subterranian tomb. 

Price is $280 FTF in Stillwater."

It was manufactured in between 1890 and 1892. Double action spins the cylinder to the right location, but the hammer will not follow through with the drop, and single action does not stay cocked.

The right grip is in fair slightly worn with some checkering still visible. The left side grip is a rough, homemade looking, wooden replacement.

For sale is a custom Nighthawk GRP Recon 1911 in .45 ACP with a Surefire x300 light and DG Switch and a custom Raven Concealment holster and dual mag pouch.

I have the bag and original test target.

This gun also has a custom Serial #: NHCDARKSIDE1.

I am the original owner. I do not have a documented round count, but it is probably about 1,500 rounds. The gun functions flawlessly. Tritium is bright. I did carry this gun for a while, so there are some cosmetic holster wear marks. This gun has been in my safe for a couple of years, and I just don't need it.

As I do not have any other 1911s with a rail, I will not break this set. The light and holster are part of the deal. I also have additional belt loop sizes from Raven for the holster.

Price is $3000. I have magazines and ammo I can put in the deal, but it will come with two Nighthawk magazines.

This pistol has several upgrades.  I've installed Heinie SlantPro Straight Eight night sights.  The rear sight can be moved with hard finger pressure after the set screw is loosened.  This makes adjustments at the range very simple.  The grips have been replaced with a deluxe Kimber rosewood set.  This pistol comes with two Chip McCormick 8rd Power Mags and additional low profile carry basepads.  The original blued, 7rd mag was never used and discarded.  This pistol has been Cerakoted black.  The slide was parkerized then Cerakoted and the frame was only Cerakoted to match.  The coating looks very good with just a couple of small blemishes that are hardly noticable.  I've put about 500 rounds through this gun with no issues before I got it finished.  I had to remove some internal finish to get it running great again.  Now there are no issues.  All told, there's about $250 worth of extras in this pistol.  It's in great shape, shoots very accurately and has continued to be reliable.  Included is the original box, papers, lock, manual, and barrel bushing tool.  I'd prefer to do a face-to-face in the local area.  Feel free to contact me with questions."

 My father purchased this gun approximately 20 years ago, made in Belgium, assembled in Portugal. the gun was originally purchased  as a home defense firearm, it hasn't ever been fired a lot, has less than 1000 rounds through it. always well maintained. when my dad got his conceal carry license he got a keltec 9mm and then eventually fell in love with my glock 23c and started carrying that. needless to say the firearm hasn't been used much at all and we have no use for it so its time for it to go. the serial number is 245pp 52826 indicating it was manufactured from Belgium parts in Portugal in the year 1988. the slide has made in Belgium assembled in Portugal stamped on its right side. from my research and past sales here and on gunbroker the firearm is worth between 650 and 850 dollars. im asking 750 dollars for the firearm. if your interested in it please call/text/email me at REDACTED or REDACTED.

H&R Pardner Pump Protector 12 gauge pump action shotgun with 3"" chamber (can fire up to 3"" shells). 18.5"" smooth bore barrel. 6-shell magazine capacity (6+1 total capacity). 

Only 20 slugs have been shot through this gun! 

For those unfamiliar with the Pardner Pump, it is basically a Remington 870 clone. The only real difference is where the barrel lug lies. But almost any Remington 870 accessory/part will work on this shotgun. And the H&R is built every bit as tough and tougher in some areas as the Remington. Just google it, read the reviews and see for yourself. 

Here are the goodies/extras: 

- Blackhawk Knoxx pistol grip adjustable length buttstock
- Blackhawk Knoxx fore grip 
- Wilson Combat +1 magazine extension (original magazine tube capacity was 5 shells, but is now 6 shells with this extension)
- Tacstar 4-shell side saddle
- 25 shell bandolier (shown in ammo picture) 
- A total of 175 shells:
   - 100 Nobel Sport, 12 pellet 00 buckshot @ 1290 fps
   - 15 Federal Premium, 8 pellet 00 buckshot @ 1325 fps (not shown, loose)

- Shoulder sling (not shown)

I have about $575 into this package, including the ammo. I am asking $425. This thing shoots great and the action is smooth. This gun is nearly brand new. 

I will not ship, and I will not deliver it past 20 miles. If you want to drive to me, more power to you. Serious inquiries and offers only, please.

 I removed the synthetic stock and replaced it with wood furniture to give it that police riot shotgun look. Looks like a shotgun off of a movie set. Also removed the very poor finish on it from the factory, spray painted in black and put sealant on it to give it a semi gloss look.

OK, because of the emails I've made an adjustment.  I'm holding firm on a price of $500 for the gun because of the expensive night sights.  These guns sell for $540 online brand new with no night sights installed.  I've accounted for that and my price is still cheaper than new.  With that being said, I'm not going to haggle or defend my price anymore!

$600 and I will throw in a Lone Wolf ported and extended barrel.  I've fired 2 fifty round boxes through this barrel since buying it. These barrels sell for over $100 new.

The blueing is 100%. Only 1 small sratch at end of barrel on left side.

This is a model 1400 MKII but the barrel is marked 1200. It was special ordered with a NON-vented ribbed 30"" barrel with FULL-CHOKE. The stamp on barrel and reciever line up.

NOW FOR THE BAD PART BUT EASY FIX.
THIS NEEDS A NEW EXTRACTOR. IT DOESNT ALLWAYS EJECT THE SPENT ROUND.

I was told $35-45 labor and $10 for the part or parts. SO EASY CHEAP FIX.

I've seen 1's on gunbroker.com go for $380-450 working 100% and $275-$350 needing some work. 

I'm asking $250 which I think is a fair price for this shotgun. The worst I can say is No thanks.

It has the power and accuracy of a 1911, with a third of the take down and maintenance. I have never had any type of problem with it at all with all kinds of different ammunition. 

Here is a review with specs on the gun: 

http://hunting.about.com/od/guns/l/aastrugerp97a.htm

I have installed a heavy duty recoil reducing rod and spring, & a custom trigger. The gun comes with 3-10 rd Pro Mag high capacity mags, 1-7 rd Ruger factory mag, & 1-8 rd Ruger factory mag, Fobus Elite paddle holster, & hard case. 

I also have a ruger 10 22  (black & stainless) with less than 50 rounds fired, that I can throw in for the right offer. 

I am looking to trade for a Full Size 1911. Must be .45 acp, Must have extended beavertail, skeletonized hammer and trigger, preferably Ruger, Remington, or Sig. No Low quality please. 

I might be open to other offers as well, worst I can say is no.

Let me know what you have and maybe we can make a trade.

• 870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.

• All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.

• All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.

• Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.

• A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.

• A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.

• Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.

• The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks.

• The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.

• The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.

• The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization.

• The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.

• The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.

• The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing."

I would have to say its had less tha 100 rounds through it cause the barrel is nice and shiny inside and the rifling grooves are still nice and deep.

You can check gunbroker, gunsamerica, backpage, and here in all the states. Every 1 looks beat to crap and the frame is wore to bare metal and they are asking $200-250.

Problem is with my cane in one hand due to a bad knee other than the range I cannot carry this pull, fire one handed easily if need be. Gun is 95-98%, factory box, manual, 4 mags, 2 10 round 2 15
 The Guy who traded me this gave me an amazing deal and I am thankful for even getting to shoot one of these but still I need a 9mm I can carry as right now I just have the browning bda .380 that is for trade on here. If I get a good carry gun offer for that I will probably keep this as I have never owned a gun close to this value or quality. I will entertain multiple gun offers for this and my Browning BDA full size .380 made by beretta. Then you can own the little brother too. Although the 380 is not so much a little brother at 13 rounds and two mags. It is smaller though!

I would trade for something I can carry and that has double action for a one handed defense if needed. I want a hammer and SA/DA. Maybe a bit smaller than this would be ok as I do not need to be able to shoot out someones eye at 75 feet. A metal framed reliable high end concealed carry 9mm is the preference here. I would do two guns as well as long as one is a 9mm carry or even a 40 and maybe a revolver along with it if the guns are not of a high value such as this Browning or a good carry and a nice .22 pistol for plinking. Specs can be seen here Hi-Power Mark III, , Browning Firearms Product

If not a pistol or pistols then a AR/AK for plinking or a seiga 12 guage, a nice lever action and a /22 pistol or rifle tactical prefered in rifle, open to offers of equal value that I have not thought of here. If nothing to trade I will offer at 675 which is low for these guns. Try finding one for under 8 in this condition. Luckily the good man who traded me this had a good camera cause mine would not do this piece justice."

I traded for this gun just today and went straight to the range. By far the best shooting .380 I have ever had the pleasure to shoot. Good groups at 50 feet. Gun is in 95-98% condition and after shooting I put it in the nice in the pants leather holster it came with and found myself worried all day that I was going to scratch it as the cheapest I have found one of these for on the net is 550 and on up to 900. I wanted a heavy steel framed gun but this one belongs in a safe in someones collection not in a holster as an every day carry. These guns are Brownings but made in Italy by Berreta as are many Brownings. Holds 13 plus 1 and is around the size of a compact 9mm. 3.5 inch barrel makes shooting much more comfy. No box, just 2 mags and holster. Hard to tell in pics but grips are a nice dark brown glossy wood style.

I would prefer a 9mm in a solid metal frame in the same general price range and condition of this gun that I can carry without feeling like I might scratch up a collectible gun. I would consider 40s,45s as well. Just make me a fair offer for a nice reliable gun and we can work it out.


Trades, CZ 75 or other CZ but would love a 75 compact. Berretta 9mm, fun ar,ak mid range pricewise rifle, surprise me but please make a fair offer if you are making one. I am sorry to those of you who bought one but I do not want it! Fun rifles always considered, would love a lever action .357. A nice .357 wheel gun is always a welcome offer."
