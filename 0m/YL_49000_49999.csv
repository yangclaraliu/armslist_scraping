I am reluctantly selling the CMP 82g I bought last week at the CMP North-Store.  These rifles were built for the US Army marksmanship program under contract during the late 1980's.  Just north of 20,000 were built by Kimber for the contract.  During the time of delivery the .22lr marksmanship programs came under heavy fire from the EPA (lead in buildings) and most were shut down.  The AMU, kept their highly tuned 40x's for small-bore comp, and the Kimbers wre left to rot in a warehouse... till the CMP got their hands on them.  You can buy two versions from the CMP now, the ""Rusty"" and the ""non-Rusty"".  the rusty requires some hard cleaning work to get it to shoot well, the non-rusty are ready to go.

Every rifle was required by the Army contract to achieve no larger than a .700"" 10-shot group at 50yrds with the match ammo available in the 1980's.  These rifles are much better with modern match grade ammo as you can see by what my ""rusty"" does all day long at 50yrds, off sand bags, with iron sights, and Eley Match (pic below)

My spouse was a little perturbed that I bought a ""keeper"" when;

a: I already had one
b: Need books for fall semester
c: Didn't call to get the purchase approved by the Minister of Finance

I just spent the past week sanding and hand rubbing pure tung oil into the stock, and painstakingly cleaning every single spot on the rifle.  I bought a ""non-rusty"" as a safe queen last wee, and a ""rusty"" a few months ago as a shooter.  Because the non-rusty is unfired in the safe, and the stock is MUCH nicer, I figured it would be a better candidate for saving my marriage, and buying books.  I am prepared to take a loss on it (~$100), so please be gentle  :-[

Good Morning All,

I have a 12 ga. from Century International Arms. Its model is the Century International Arms Ultra 87. It will chamber both 2-3/4"" and 3"" 12 ga. shells. It has a 19"" cylinder bore barrel, sling swivels, 5-round magazine capacity, day-glo orange rifle sights, and synthetic stocks.

I purchased this shotgun from Century; they said it might need a tuneup from a gunsmith. When I tore it apart to clean it, everything seemed functional except for the ejector spring (missing). I can attest that the shotgun ejects rounds fine without it (will eject shells several feet). It appears the arms holding the shells in the magazine need to be adjusted as a new round isn't always released into the action when the slide is pushed rearward. Safety, trigger, etc. all functions fine. It just needs a going-over by someone with a little time and patience, hence the low price.

Let me know if you're interested and we'll get together. Price is negotiable, just shoot me an email."

----
I am selling a Glock model 30 compact 45cal pistol with standard sights and two 10rd magazines.  It is completely stock and comes with the original box and contents (magazine loader, cleaning brush, paperwork, test fire cases). A few comments:

PBM serial number prefix with 4256-1- trigger bar.
Mar 10 2010 test fire date.
Exactly 300 rounds of factory ammunition (Federal, WWB, Speer) has been fired for function testing. Very accurate, soft recoil for a 45cal. No malfunctions or other issues, flawless operation.
It is in excellent, ""like new"" condition. Thoroughly cleaned and inspected before firing. Lubricated per manufacturer recommendations. Doesn't even have the usual ""smilies"" on the barrel (although I can't take full credit for that, the new barrel finish is great).

This pistol can sometimes be difficult to find and goes for about $549 new around here, so you are looking at over $600 after taxes. This would be great for someone looking for 45cal in a compact, accurate package. I'm asking $500 FTF. No taxes (or shipping and transfer fees if buying online). Also, no 4473 to fill out if that is important to you.

The usual rules apply: cash only, meet in neutral location for exchange.

Item description from Barrett's website: Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Model 82A1. For more than two decades, this short-recoil, semi-automatic series rifle has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. The result is a feat of engineering so impossibly precise, it's hard to believe it's man-made. Unlike other semi-automatic .50 BMG rifles, the Model 82A1 is completely reliable. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The Model 82A1 fits into a regular sized carrying case. Although it's transported as a disassembled upper and lower receiver, it can be ready to fire in under a minute by simply inserting two assembly pins through both receivers. The scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, maintaining scope zero. The rifle's M1913 optics rail is tapered 27 MOA to take full advantage of the scope's elevation travel.

Comes with 1 10rd mag.Very light trigger pull.I would say it's in about 90% or so condition depending on the grader.My 90% condition estimate is a conservative one, you can see for yourself the condition it is in.Has a few small scratches on it.Would like to trade for other handguns up to a .40cal and rifles up to a .223,would be primarily interested in glocks,sigs,M&P's,Taurus etc or would like to trade for or towards an AR.Cash price right now I'm asking $600.FTF in South part of Fort Wayne preferred, but would travel up to 40miles for the right deal.PM me with offers/questions.Thanks for looking!"

There is a large outer ring and inner dot that is projected onto the front reflective glass simply by being outside in the existing ambient light. Even on a heavy overcast day, this sight works perfectly!! This is the Model 47 and it is stamped ""patent applied for"". It was made by the Swain Nelson Company of Glenview, Illinois. 

Developed from technology used in WWII bomb-sights, it is a fore-runner of the red-dot, hologram and reflex-type weapon sights popular today.  Allied aircraft had similar sights using the exact same principal, and shot down many axis war planes using their modified Nydar Sights. The inner dot represents 12"" inches at 50 yards, while the outer ring is positioned so that the ring itself is always 24"" inches from the inner dot. This makes the Nydar Gun Sight the PERFECT ""shotgun"" hunting sight. 

There are adjustments for windage and elevation, the sight is mounted on a base plate and that is able to be manipulated for front to rear and side to side movement, once it is zero'd you lock it down.
