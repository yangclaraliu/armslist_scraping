This rifle was won at a raffle and has never been fired and never had a scope mounted on it.  It is new in the box.  All manuals, etc. are included as is the original box.  Two boxes of Remington 100gr ammo is also included (50 dollar value).  

The rifle now retails for 320.  The ammo is 50. Plus tax in a store and you are looking at 395 in a store.

The trigger has no creep and is crisp and probably breaks at about 4.5 lbs (estimate).  Very nice and smooth bolt action.

I have a setup that doesnt come available too often. I have set this rifle up as an Ultimate AR.  I am looking to see if someone is interested. This is a very expensive setup. I may trade plus cash on your end, trade even or take all cash. Here is what I have:

Noveske Gen 2 Light Carbine. 14.5 inch barrel (they are the Premier barrel maker in the industry and this barrel is made to the specs of an M249 MG barrel which has 2X this chrome lining)  it is a super tight gun. The frame fit is second to none.  It has an SWS quad rail from the factory.  Has a Surefire Flash hider/ Suppressor mount pinned and welded from the factory as well.  It has a special VLTOR stock that only comes on this gun.  QD Noveske End plate, Noveske Troy flip up sights. Ambi mag release from TROY, Noveske Combat trigger, Noveske (VLTOR's new Gunfighter Gen 2) Charging handle.  Surefire Scout Light with Daniel Defense 1 O'clock mount and SR07 Surefire on/off and momemtary switch. Tango Down Stubby vert grip.  Magpul MIAD grip.   Magpul Sling attachment point. Troy rail Covers.
Brand new Leupold 1.1-8X  MARK 8 CQBSS  (Close Quarters Battle Sniper Scope)  Horus H27D Reticle, Front Focal Plane, Illuminated Holographic 5 MOA dot.  SWEET!!    If you have heard anything about this unit then you will know that it IS THE VERY TOP of the scope industry right now.  This scope is amazing.  It is a 4500 dollar unit and comes with the Leupold IMS mounting system and the Leupold Alumina lens caps.   This scope has it all. Locking turrets, Quick change Bullet drop rings, which I have 3 of. 1) .308 2) 55 grain 5.56  3) 62 grain 5.56.    This means that you can easily change the load or caliber and this scope will be set up to dial for that specific load.     But you dont have to dial anymore if you dont want to.  The Horus Reticle allows the shooter to view a miss and immediately adjust his hold with no re-dialing.  Its a very very nice system.  This is the only scope I have ever had that the Illumination works in broad daylight as well.  It is a Holographic system.  The scope is in perfect condition as well.

I will sell the whole setup for $6,500 dollars.  
If you want to shoot me a trade offer go ahead, cash offers are good to go as well."

It has a couple scuff on the magazine tube from use, but you are going to want to put an 8 shell adapter on it anyways aren't ya?
It has the mesa tactical haydraulic recoil stock so shooting anything out of it is very managable. I love this gun but I want to get a nice 1911, an hk45 or hk45C. It comes with 3 buttstocks, a scabbard, night sights, hogue grip, and a push button one point sling. I have included the prices of all the accessories and links to the majority of the accessories. It is 18 months old and has had about 350 rounds throught it.
All in all im in $1254 for the gun, so a good trade would be a great deal on your part.

I got a Bushmaster ARM, it dry fires and will cycle rounds by hand just fine. It's from about the 70's and is considered a Pistol. There were only a few thousand made and this is one of them. It takes AR15 magazines and P-mags fit inside of it and cycles by hand as well. No magazines are included though. This one has a very low serial number, in the 400's. It looks like it could use a paint job, but it looks like a cool gun and is VERY RARE. After a new paint-job it could be worth quite a bit more than I am listing it for. This is quite the collector's piece. I am looking for a sale or trade (even multiple guns on your end), but prefer partial trade. I'm not looking to trade up at all.

I WILL NOT TRADE THIS FOR A $250 GUN I AM NOT RETARDED. Please do not treat me like I am, I will not treat you like you are. This is probably your ONLY chance to own one of these guns and I am even selling this for a steal! I WILL TAKE MULTIPLE GUNS IN TRADE THAT ARE LISTED BELOW. IF YOUR GUN DOES NOT EQUAL THE VALUE OF THIS ONE, THEN YOU ARE TO ADD CASH TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE.

DON'T EMAIL ME RETARDED OFFERS. I am not stupid, but I may take reasonable offers of guns and cash or combinations of the two. I AM FIRM ON THE PRICE TAG AND VALUE OF THIS GUN.

**Range report for Monday Aug 6, 2012.  The 45 setup shot fantastic.  I could not be more pleased after 50 rounds.  I have owned 1911's that cost more than double and I have to say I am impressed.  The real surprise is from the .22 slide conversion.  I shot 12 full magazines (10 round capacity) and had a slide lock 10/12 mag loads.  This is definitely an improvement over some of the other 1911's I have shot with the conversion unit.  But that is not what impressed me, the ability to nail the bulls 10-ring bullet after bullet after bullet.  The RIA 1911 is a fantastic platform for the .22 slide straight out of the box.  I only meant to warm up with the .22 to learn the new trigger on the RIA platform but kept reloading and smiling after each grouping in the 10-ring.  It was addicting.

This is definitely a great setup.  Learn the trigger and make grip/aim corrections using $0.04 a round then change the slide and let the 45's rip a hole in the bulls.  You get 525 rounds for $19 (Federal 36 gr) vs 50 rounds for $21 (or $10 if you load your own and get free brass).  Either way, you can't beat the trigger and flinch training from the conversion slide.  The solid steel setup mimics the native 45 slide setup so weight and holster draw is the same.

Local pickup only.  Not accepting trades at the moment unless it is a Doublestar 1911 without rail.  I am not separating the package.  Low offers will be ignored."

It was patented by john M. Browning in 1915 and the patent was sold to Remington in 1915. Remington started producing the model 17 in 1921 after WWI. They produced 73,000 between 1921 and 1933. The model 17 was only produced in 20ga. After the Remington patent expired. This model was picked up by Ithaca and became the famous model 37 Ithaca. The model 17 also was used as a model for the model 31 Remington skeetgun and the model 870 Remington that has sold more than any other shotgun.

The REPR rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 12” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. 

The REPR rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers. 

The REPR rifle is available in three models: Standard Model (12”, 16.1”), Designated Marksman Rifle (18”), and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each REPR rifle comes with one barreled upper but extra uppers are available in light contour 12” and 16.1”, medium contour 18” and heavy contour 20” configurations. Custom packages including one lower and two or more barreled uppers are available. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. Contact our customer service department for specifications. 

The revolutionary LWRC International REPR rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with."

Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art. The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles."

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (REPR) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The REPR rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 12” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. 

The REPR rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers. 

The REPR rifle is available in three models: Standard Model (12”, 16.1”), Designated Marksman Rifle (18”), and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each REPR rifle comes with one barreled upper but extra uppers are available in light contour 12” and 16.1”, medium contour 18” and heavy contour 20” configurations. Custom packages including one lower and two or more barreled uppers are available. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. Contact our customer service department for specifications. 

The revolutionary LWRC International REPR rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with."

The American Historical Foundation is proud to honor our American Armed Forces by issuing a separate, firing commemorative Thompson in honor of the USMC. It is a beast of a weapon — a hefty twelve pounds unloaded; it takes two hands to hold it. Highly Collectible; First Ever Because these custom-gunsmithed Thompsons are the first ever issued to specifically honor our Armed Forces, they are highly desirable and sought after, especially by veterans, their families and patriotic collectors. Unlike most modern firearms, all the major components are actually machined from massive, solid blocks of steel. The fit and finish are presentation grade. The precision-milled receiver is highly polished to highlight the deeply etched and gold-gilt infilled commemorative inscriptions, including the famous Thompson “Bullet” trademark. 24-Karat Gold Plating Sight across the 24-Karat Gold plated rear sight, through the slot in the 24-Karat Gold plated actuator knob and over the 35 deep cooling fins of the mirror-polished-and-blued barrel. Yet more 24-Karat Gold plating gleams across the mirror-polished Cutts Compensator, front sight and trigger. All the plating is to Jewelers Grade-Heavy thickness, for lasting beauty and value. The deluxe walnut stocks—beautifully finished to high gloss—show off the three fired-enamel cloisonnés inlays (one on reverse) and the 24-Karat Gold plated sling swivels, swivel mounts and screws. A Firing Semi-Automatic This is a firing Thompson, chambered for the same famous, readily-available .45 ACP ammunition that American military men and shooters have admired and relied on since 1911. Each has special Registry Numbers between 001 and 750, with the prefix of the service branch honored (i.e., USMC 226).

DESCRIPTION:

This auction is for a new OEM (Original Equipment of the Manufacturer) Saiga 12 gauge shotgun that has been converted to a 29 inch ""Bullpup Beast Destroyer.""  Special attention was used when adding the Kushnapup Series V Bullpup kit and ""allen bolts"" were used instead of the factory supplied ""phillips screws.""  The gas system was also re-worked and the gun has been test fired to ensure safety and reliability.  A ULTIMAK Gas Tube Top Rail has been professionally installed by a licensed gunsmith for accomidating various optics like the included AIMPOINT T-1 MICRO.  The T-1 MICRO is rated for 12 gauge shotguns and tested in some of the world's harshest environments.  (It also has an estimated 5-year battery life.  Visit www.aimpoint.com for complete specs).  To sumarize, this build is ideal for various close quarter combat senarios, home defense applications and destroying just about anything.  If that weren't enough, the gun ships in a US Peacekeeper Tactical Soft Gun Case
