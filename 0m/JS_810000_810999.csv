Holds 16 rounds of potent 230 grain. Guns like this may not be around much longer. Get it while you can. I have an excellent condition FN 45 Tactical that I'm looking to sell. It is set up for suppressed usage and I have used it this way. It shoots great suppressed and Unsuppressed.   This gun has a threaded barrel, suppressor height sights that have Trijicon Tritium inserts. The front is green And the back 2 are yellow. They call these contrast night sights. The gun shoots great. Extremely accurate. I have had 2 of these before and this one is far more accurate than they were. My buddy had a regular FN 45 and he was blown away by how accurate this 45 Tactical was.  It only has about 350 rounds fired. Has been really treated well and properly maintained.  Comes just like from the factory. Eagle carrying case that is extremely nice. It has a place for 2 mags (one in the gun), the gun, a suppressor and a small accessory pouch. The FN logo is embroidered on the outside. This is the Lipseys Special Edition that is ALL BLACK.   Comes with 3 (15) round mags.  These are hard to come by and one this accurate is VERY hard to find. I think I just got lucky on this one really. I will sell it for $1200

I am not an FFL so here's how sales will happen:
1) face-to-face sales will happily be done IF the buyer has a MO CC endorsement, an LEO ID, or they're willing to let me run their name thru joint communications to ensure they can legally own such firearm.
2) Shipping is possible, but it's $50 through my local shop.  UPS requires handguns be done overrnight and long guns are heavy/large packages and my local shop requires a fee for processing, packaging, and shipping of firearms...I AM NOT MAKING ANY MONEY SHIPPING!  The shop needs a copy of the receiveing FFL's license to legally ship and won't do so until they have it.

I am selling all these firearms for my grandfather.  If you have specific questions, I may have to ask him, which could take some time.  I can haggle some, but will not be low balled.  When you email me, please list which firearm it is in regard to."

I am not an FFL so here's how sales will happen:
1) face-to-face sales will happily be done IF the buyer has a MO CC endorsement, an LEO ID, or they're willing to let me run their name thru joint communications to ensure they can legally own such firearm.
2) Shipping is possible, but it's $50 through my local shop.  UPS requires handguns be done overrnight and long guns are heavy/large packages and my local shop requires a fee for processing, packaging, and shipping of firearms...I AM NOT MAKING ANY MONEY SHIPPING!  The shop needs a copy of the receiveing FFL's license to legally ship and won't do so until they have it.

I am selling all these firearms for my grandfather.  If you have specific questions, I may have to ask him, which could take some time.  I can haggle some, but will not be low balled.  When you email me, please list which firearm it is in regard to."

I am not an FFL so here's how sales will happen:
1) face-to-face sales will happily be done IF the buyer has a MO CC endorsement, an LEO ID, or they're willing to let me run their name thru joint communications to ensure they can legally own such firearm.
2) Shipping is possible, but it's $50 through my local shop.  UPS requires handguns be done overrnight and long guns are heavy/large packages and my local shop requires a fee for processing, packaging, and shipping of firearms...I AM NOT MAKING ANY MONEY SHIPPING!  The shop needs a copy of the receiveing FFL's license to legally ship and won't do so until they have it.

I am selling all these firearms for my grandfather.  If you have specific questions, I may have to ask him, which could take some time.  I can haggle some, but will not be low balled.  When you email me, please list which firearm it is in regard to."

They produce fine replica firearms, mainly from the American Civil War period, such as this model 1861 Springfield rifle.

This rifle was purchased in the mid-90s for some light (read: weekend warrior, but not even that many weekends) Civil War reenacting.  It is in great condition, save for some light tarnishing on the ramrod and a few other spots.  It is in full working order and comes with a brand new case that is worth well over $100.  

I have had this in my collection for years, and it has been fired maybe 50 times.  The beautiful walnut stock is in great condition with no real gouges or scratches.  It was thoroughly cleaned and reconditioned, and is being sold as-is.

Has been used as porcupine buster for years in Canada, so there are some scratches on the stock.

I am not an FFL so here's how sales will happen:
1) face-to-face sales will happily be done IF the buyer has a MO CC endorsement, an LEO ID, or they're willing to let me run their name thru joint communications to ensure they can legally own such firearm.
2) Shipping is possible, but it's $50 through my local shop.  UPS requires handguns be done overrnight and long guns are heavy/large packages and my local shop requires a fee for processing, packaging, and shipping of firearms...I AM NOT MAKING ANY MONEY SHIPPING!  The shop needs a copy of the receiveing FFL's license to legally ship and won't do so until they have it.

I am selling all these firearms for my grandfather.  If you have specific questions, I may have to ask him, which could take some time.  I can haggle some, but will not be low balled.  When you email me, please list which firearm it is in regard to."

I am selling two of my very beautiful rifles from my collection. I need to make some things right in my life right now financially. I REALLY do not want to do this. I love both of these rifles, and with the coming storm both are more then likley to be targeted but highly valuable. The Marlin 30/30 is a pre-cross bolt saftey, which can be highly desirable. Manufacture date is somewhere around 1981. It is in absolutly stellar condition, with clean rich blueing and smooth, clean stock. It is all orginal condition, and from my estimates it was shot less then 100 rounds, including what I used. No scratches or BS here. It is almost off the shelf condition. The VEPR is also in new condition, except this one has never been shot and I bought it new from Atlantic arms about 2 months ago. This is the top of the line factory made russian AK's, and I will probably never own another again with the way things are panning out politcally. Once again, it has not been shot, and is in brand new condition. Both come with some ammo, about 450 rounds of wolf polyformance 7.62x39, about 60 rounds of 30/30 and the VEPR comes with 7 thirty round magazines as well.  3 are polymer, 4 are steel commie russian and bulgarian. I need to see $1600 for the VEPR, and $525 for the Marlin. I am open to REASONABLE OFFERS.

I am not an FFL so here's how sales will happen:
1) face-to-face sales will happily be done IF the buyer has a MO CC endorsement, an LEO ID, or they're willing to let me run their name thru joint communications to ensure they can legally own such firearm.
2) Shipping is possible, but it's $50 through my local shop.  UPS requires handguns be done overrnight and long guns are heavy/large packages and my local shop requires a fee for processing, packaging, and shipping of firearms...I AM NOT MAKING ANY MONEY SHIPPING!  The shop needs a copy of the receiveing FFL's license to legally ship and won't do so until they have it.

I am selling all these firearms for my grandfather.  If you have specific questions, I may have to ask him, which could take some time.  I can haggle some, but will not be low balled.  When you email me, please list which firearm it is in regard to."

Classic 1977 Jeep Wagoneer, 360 V-8 Automatic, Quadra Trac 4X4, P/S, P/B, Tilt Wheel,Cruise. This Jeep has 158,200 miles on it. Most of the driveline was rebuilt around 110,000 miles, the motor was rebuilt at about 86,000 miles. The tires have plenty of tread left. I have owned this vehicle for the last 20 years and am only the second owner. This Jeep is all original but hubcaps and radio it runs good does not smoke or use oil and is driven daily. 

If you want it for less than 2k (unless you have a partial rifle/pistol or ammo trade.No even swaps) please say us both some time if you don't have the means to get it or want to haggle.

Thing it needs is repair to the power tailgate wires in the pinchwell from body to tailgate (currently in down position).Cruise control needs repair also (never needed it so might be just a fuse)

Floors are solid,all glass in intact and not cracked,has optional roof rack to save you some interior room.Bucket seats with fold down armrest. Just a good solid running classic that will get you where you want to go and back.

Please note just about every panel has some rust or dent from the Doctor who ran into everything on his farm.Floors are solid and used parts are dirt cheap if you ever want to make it so nice that you won't want to go off road again (ha ha).

Seriously don't call if you just want to chit chat.I am a nice guy but do not like people who are cheapskates or waste my time. Anything less (trades excepted) than the 2k CASH (no exceptions) and it is worth more to me to keep as a second vehicle.

Good condition, honest wear from hunting

I am not an FFL so here's how sales will happen:
1) face-to-face sales will happily be done IF the buyer has a MO CC endorsement, an LEO ID, or they're willing to let me run their name thru joint communications to ensure they can legally own such firearm.
2) Shipping is possible, but it's $50 through my local shop.  UPS requires handguns be done overrnight and long guns are heavy/large packages and my local shop requires a fee for processing, packaging, and shipping of firearms...I AM NOT MAKING ANY MONEY SHIPPING!  The shop needs a copy of the receiveing FFL's license to legally ship and won't do so until they have it.

I am selling all these firearms for my grandfather. If you have specific questions, I may have to ask him, which could take some time. I can haggle some, but will not be low balled. When you email me, please list which firearm it is in regard to."

First listing was for 3 mags.  However, buyer said all 3 were junk and didn't work so we worked out a deal and I ended up wit these back.  I took a look and he's right about one.  it is junk.  the 2nd one was a little tight fitting into the mag well, but fed ok on my AR, and the 3rd fits fine, and feeds fine with no fail to feeds. (I'm currently loading a couple videos to You-Tube that shows the magazines feeding fine with no FTF or FTE or jams.) I did notice that they do not hold the BCG open on the last round though.  Because he had problems with them, I'm asking for less money and because I'm telling you that they may have issues for you, I will not offer refunds/exchange--all sales final.   I'm being as honest as I can with these and just looking to make a little spare cash for something that I don't use anymore.    

These have sat in my range bag for about 10 years now. (can't believe it's 2013 already!!)  I bought them in 2003 during the first AWB/Hi-cap mag ban, so they were made before 1994, but that's all I can tell you about them.

Sale is now for all 3 40-round magazines for $50.  I'm willing to ship if you cover shipping fees.

From Browning:
Short Action. Long Action. Ready for Any Action.
As a rule, lever-action aficionados have always had to trade away power and accuracy for quick handling and easy carrying. With the Browning BLR those compromises are a thing of the past. The design of the BLR is as modern as tomorrow with an aircraft-grade alloy receiver, glass-smooth rack and pinion system and multi-lug rotating bolt that handles many of the most popular magnum cartridges, including the fast new WSMs. The exceptional accuracy of the BLR comes from its precision machined, button-rifled barrel that puts those fast-stepping magnum bullets exactly where they're wanted. Add in the advantages of several great stock designs and finishes, a detachable box magazine, low profile adjustable sights and a wide, grooved trigger that travels with the lever to avoid pinching fingers and it's clear the Browning BLR is ready for any action."

This particular model has a 20"" barrel.  The 835 accepts 2 3/4, 3, and 3 1/2 inch shells, and has a removable choke.  The choke in the gun is a .695 H.S. Strut Undertaker.  Included with the gun is a matching sling.

From what I understand the shotgun is designed for Turkey Hunting.  I had traded for this gun with the intention of getting into duck hunting with some guys from work.  But after my wife found out the price to buy Decoys, Waders, Blinds, etc. she told me I was no longer interested in duck hunting.....

So long story short, I have no need for this shotgun.  I have fired ten shells through this gun and everything functions as it should.  I do not know a total round count as I got it second hand.  Before posting this gun I completely disassembled and cleaned it.

The gun is in good shape and shows only a few scratches in the camo.  I DO NOT have the magazine plug for this gun.

This shotgun seems like it would be ideal for Turkey, Duck, or even home defense due to the 20"" Barrel.  The Barrel reads ""Not for use with Slugs"".

If you have any questions, comments, concerns please ask. I would be willing to take any photographs of the gun you want, just let me know."

For sale is my 581-Series Ruger Mini 14 Tactical. I purchased this back in September (took receipt of it 9/11/12). It has functioned flawlessly and has been well-cared for. It has been kept in a locked cabinet when not in use and has always been transported in a padded rifle case. It has never been dropped or damaged in any way. There are some slight marks on the stock from normal use, but the metal is clean and rust-free, as it should be. I have fired about 350 rounds (.223 and 5.56, both brass and steel) through this rifle without a single failure of any kind.

This rifle is the 16.5"" Tactical model in a Hogue Overmolded Stock (I have the original synthetic stock as well and will include it). I have 3 20-round Ruger Magazines for this rifle as well as the standard 5-round Ruger Magazine. I have a Redfield 2-7x Scope mounted in Warne QD Rings on the rifle which are also included. I do not have the original Ruger rings that came with this rifle as I sold them to help fund the Warne Rings (which are far superior, in my opinion). I also have the Warne Torx tool for achieving optimal torque on the rings (25 in/lbs., I believe). All of this will be included in the original boxes (the box for the rifle is slightly worn and the box for the scope is missing the barcode because I redeemed a rebate on it). 

I am offering this up as a package deal and will not split it up. the included image is of the actual rifle for sale. I took it a couple of months ago. I will be happy to send photos of the other two 20-round magazines and the 5-round magazine if you would like to see them prior to purchase, but I can assure you they are there. 

This rifle is for sale in the Columbia area (I live in Sumter). I am willing to drive a short distance to meet you to make the transaction. I will fill out a bill of sale with the details about the rifle (serial number, model number, etc.) as well as my name, address, phone number and DL number and I expect the same information from you (I will accept a CWP in lieu of a DL). We will both get a copy of the paperwork for our records. I won't forego the paperwork on this rifle. If you are not willing to do the paperwork, I'm not willing to sell it to you. If you would prefer an FFL transfer, I can meet you at a gun shop (I have one in Sumter that I use a lot) and I will cover my transfer fees. 

Please message me if you have any questions or concerns. I am asking $1200 OBO on this. In partial trade, I would consider a good quality 22LR AR Upper with magazines or an EOTECH 512 (or similar EOTECH optic - nothing with NV as I don't need it). 

Thanks,

 The Minnesota Legislature will convene tomorrow, and given the media coverage of recent events, there is little doubt that gun control will be on the agenda of many metro legislators.

The threats we face
 With Mark Dayton in the Governor's mansion and DFL majorities in both the House and the Senate, that poses a real and significant threat.  The House Public Safety Finance and Policy Committee is chaired by Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL, 64B, St. Paul), who has been a leading voice in destroying your rights.

 In the Senate, the Transportation and Public Safety Committee will be led by Sen. Scott Dibble (DFL, 61, Minneapolis). We expect him to attempt a so-called ""assault weapon"" ban, and Sen. John Marty (DFL, 66, Roseville) is already pushing licensing and registration of your legally owned guns.

Our secret weapon
 Things look dire, but we have a secret weapon: you.

 The gun control ""movement"" isn't grass-roots: it's Astroturf. A tiny minority of misguided, zealots, funded by the deep pockets of limousine liberals and foundations, make a lot of noise, but have no real popular support.

 On the other hand, the gun rights community is real, large, and engaged. That will be vital in the coming days and weeks.

What you can do
 •Call your Minnesota senator and representative today! Their info at the bottom of this email. If it's missing, you haven't told us where you live. That's vital information when we need to make sure that certain representatives hear from their gun-owning constituents. Please click the link and give us your address, so we can get your help when needed most.

•Email your Minnesota senator and representative.  Your message should be short, polite, and in your own words: ◦ I'm a constituent
◦ I'm a law-abiding gun owner
◦ I oppose ANY new restrictions on my freedoms
◦ The legislature should deal with the criminals and the insane, but not blame or punish us for their actions
◦ I support the Gun Owners Civil Rights Alliance and their mission (and you should, too!)
◦ Forward this email to your friends and family! Encourage them to sign up for these emails. Together, we are powerful.


•Send a donation! For the last 23 years, we've run on a shoestring, and many activists have paid with their own wealth, careers and family time to support, defend and advance your rights. With the threats we face today, a pure volunteer effort may not be enough. Any amount you can spare -- $50, $25, even $10 will help. Think about this: If every carry permit holder sent us a dollar a year, we'd have a full-time attorney working for your rights. If every gun owner sent us a buck a year, we'd have a busy staff working full time for you.

Still have energy? Great! We need it!
 • Write a letter to the editor of your local paper. In 100 words or less, tell them that as a law-abiding gun owner, you should not be blamed or punished for the actions of criminals and crazies.

Stay tuned; we'll have more news in the coming days, and some exciting opportunities.


Reminder: We're training teachers and principals to protect schools!

I've got a Gen 2 Glock 22 that I wouldn't mind parting with.  I started to polish the slide and need another go around, however it kinda looks cool. Comes with two .40 magazines and hogue grip.  I want to entertain some trade offers, just one thing...I have no interest in Muzzleloaders.  I don't hunt with them and its not the 1800s.  With that said...everything else is a possibility.  Heck, I might even trade you for a crap ton of 9mm/.380 ACP.  Let me know.  You can reach me at 269-598-seven14seven."

  I have what's left of a Win. 52 that someone was using as a project.  The most important components - - barrel & fire control system -- look to be fine.  The trigger has been worked on, and breaks like an icecycle.  The barrel I haven't tackled, but under layers of lead, I would bet is a pristine Winny tube.  
  The stock is a decent amateur silhouette style attempt in a light wood, contrasting forearm tip.
  Gun came without any open sights but is not drilled or tapped, if it was someone's goal to restore the rifle.

However, I prefer the 7.62x39 round and have decided I'd rather get rid of this and buy a nice AK-47 instead.  Feel free to ask me questions.  I'm sure there are details I've forgotten.

There are only a few things I'm willing to take in trade or partial trade toward this.  
Long-range rifle in 308 or 243 / Nice AK's (no WASR's or junk) / Ruger 10/22 or Charger (prefer Stainless) / Remington 870 Police Magnum / Ruger SR22 Pistol or MK III / Inexpensive 9mm pistols (the kind of thing I could keep in a tool box or under the seat of the truck)"
