I have almost $3000 invested in this gun and it's hard to part with it, but I don't get out to the range to shoot it much anymore - my interests went in a different direction. I've put about 400-500 rounds through it and shot some really good groups (at least for me) with 168gr Amax handloads. Last time I had it at the range, it was grouping half-inch pretty easy at 100yds with the factory barrel. That being said, I want $2000 back from it, but I will let it go for $1800. There's a lot of value here for $1800 and I hope my rifle goes to a good home.  For the right person, I could make a trip somewhere to meet up - I don't think that I'd be willing to ship because of the weight. Let me know if there are any questions. Thanks.

On July 25th, Mitt Romney had this to say about ""assault rifles"" when he stated, ""These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense, they are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people.”

This is a very cool older AK (Type 56) with the pig sticker that was imported into California in the late 80's and often used in Hollywood productions.  This includes the Rifle, Pig Sticker, sling, 1 mag and the original cleaning kit that fits in the stock.  It is stamped GSAD on the receiver (Golden State Arms Distribution)   This one has a very low serial number; 3212. I talked with the original importer April 2012, he was super nice to talk with and very knowledgable about the rifles. He has been out of business since the early 90's so he told me he was going off of 20 year old memories and trying to recall each shipment. 
This was NOT the more common Jing-An that was also a G.S.A.D imported rifle.  This was also prior to the very sought after Clayco version, so this gem in a rare find.   He told me it would be nearly impossible to track where that exact serial number went, however this is a very early import as not many of them were stamped as ""Norinco"" and it likely did go to one of two prop houses.  He gave me the names of the two Hollywood Prop houses he sold these rifles to. I tried to contact Stenbridge Prop House, but I think they are out of business. I was able to talk to someone at the second prop house, called HandProp.  We went over details on this AK-47 and he gave me further insight.  He said if it was used by a principal actor, they don't keep track of what serial number is used by which actor.  The prop director just picks several up.  
This particular one has not been converted to accept blanks, so it is a standard AK-47.  Meaning it fires normal because it is a normal gun.  This also indicates it was not fired DURING any movie.  I hope all that helps, as confusing as it is.

Here is more information about GSAD from: http://www.chicom47.com/Importers/ImportCompanies.htm :


G.S.A.D: 
Golden State Arms Distribution located in California. They had many locations including Redondo Beach, Manhattan Beach, Pasadena, and Santa Fe, CA. These guns are the most mysterious as they arrived in America about the same time as the Clayco guns, except they had less manufacturing markings. They simply state 7.62x39mm “Made in China” GSAD, in a usually faint roll stamping, that’s it…no factory codes and no exporter markings. Many argue these got here before the Claycos, thus the reason for the additional markings on the Claycos. The majority of these rifles were bought up by companies in Hollywood to be used in the production of movies and have come to be referred to as “movie guns.” In the late 1980s, production of movies showcasing the Vietnam War had tapered off and the movie guns were sold by the hundreds by the movie houses to distributors nationwide.GSAD however, had been in the firearms importation business for many years prior. Their claim to fame was being an importer of Enfield type rifles. They also imported weapons under the name Globco as early as 1957. GSAD is also to have been rumored as the source of firearms for the Bay of Pigs invasion, as well a clandestine asset of the Central Intelligence Agency. GSAD is known to have imported rifles in the 053xx range, as well as atleast serial #'s 0787x through 09xxx, in both fixed stock and underfolding configurations. ""Double-underfold"" models with folding spike bayonets and underfolding stocks have also been reported. GSAD imports are usually marked over the trigger guard on the left side of the receiver.


I tried to link a closed Gunbroker auction but I cannot figure it out.  So I took a screen shot of one that looks like the same GSAD except it didn't have near as low of a serial number, nor a ""Hollywood"" AK-47.  It sold for $1855.

Very nice little pocket gun and comes with one mag.

When police officers or concealed carry permit holders look for the ultimate in concealability, they look to the Beretta Bobcat in .25 Auto and .22 Long Rifle. This double-action pistol may be tiny, but it’s a reliable defensive arm. The tip-up barrel of this pocket pistol allows rounds to be loaded directly into the chamber without slide retraction. Precisely rifled for accuracy, the barrel is forged out of special high strength stainless steel.

QUALITY POCKET PISTOLS. 
The same dedication to advanced design, uncompromising quality and strict quality control that make the 92F, Cougar and Cheetah such international standouts is found in all Beretta small caliber, pocket-size pistols. Simplicity, safety and practical use are their best qualities.

PRACTICAL AND SIMPLE. 
User-friendly design is common to all Beretta small frames. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore quickly checked. Jamming and stovepiping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas. 

AADVANCE MATERIALS. 
Keeping an eye on quality helps keep Beretta small caliber semi-automatics out front. Beretta pistols in the 21 Series utilize the toughest of forgings for their barrels, while slides are fashioned from solid steel bar stock. Frames are machined from solid aluminum forgings. The new Inox versions utilize the finest materials, difficult to machine but exceptionally corrosion resistant and durable. 

21 BOBCAT. TRUSTWORTHY AND PRECISE.
Chambered for .22LR or .25ACP (6.35 mm). This compact, rugged small frame measures just 4.9 inches (125 mm) overall and weighs only 11.5 ounces (325 grams). It features a lightweight, alloy frame, blued steel slide, tip-up barrel, and double/single action. The Bobcat comes with a 7-round magazine for .22LR ammunition, or an 8 round magazine for .25 (6.35 mm)caliber cartridges."

It comes with one Wilson Combat 7 round magazine, one Kimber 7 round magazine and an Uncle Mike's hip holster. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Colt 1991A1, I grabbed this short description from Colt's website:

""The Colt 1991 Series is a direct descendant of the original Colt M1911. A long trigger, flat mainspring housing and original style recoil spring system remain from the original M1911 design. Upgrades from the original include white dot sights and a lowered ejection port for extra reliability.""

Price is somewhat firm but trades, both part or full, will be considered! Looking for a Paul Conway leather firefighting helmet, color isn't super important but it has to be usable. I'm willing to travel a reasonable distance to make a deal, as long as buyer/trader agrees to a bill of sale with both of our info. Just to cover both of our butts!

The twist is 1:10"". He disassembled the bolt, cleaned it, and reassembled it and worked the trigger to a nice, creepless pull. It has a one piece Leupold base.

I received the gun last year as my first shotgun. Previous seller had only put 25 shots through it in the previous 30 years. Since I received it, I have put another 300 shells through it, mainly shooting clays. It has been cleaned after every outing and performs flawlessly with little recoil. Only reason I am selling is because I have since bought a Beretta for clays and duck hunting and this gun is on the backburner. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I would prefer to meet FTF.

It was re-arsenaled after the war where the muzzle was counter-bored to improve accuracy and it was put into its current M-44 stock.  It has a round, low wall receiver.  Numbers match on the barrel, bolt, magazine floorplate, and buttplate, with no forced matches.  It was imported to the US by Tennessee Guns in Knoxville and has a discreet import mark on the underside of the barrel.  I purchased it on October 7, 2002 from AIM, and have cared for it meticulously since then, cleaning it thoroughly and lubricating it lightly after the three times I shot it.  I estimate I have put 60 rounds through it.  The pictures tell the story of the condition.  Note that the varnish from the arsenal is still heavily present on the rear sling escutcheon, and lightly on the front.  Includes cleaning rod shown in pictures.  The bore is bright and rifling is strong.  High resolution pictures are available on request.

FTF transaction preferred.  Must present government picture ID showing you are a resident of Ohio of legal age to purchase this firearm.

If there is not a quick local sale, I will consider shipping to an FFL (including Type 03, C&R).  If interested, contact me for a shipping quote.

(If you are confused about all the $90 Mosin-Nagants flooding the market these days, those are M91/30 model rifles with 29"" barrels. That's a good deal on those older, longer rifles. You should get one of those too before the supply dries up, like it has on this model M38 carbine with 20"" barrel that I am selling.)"

If you have never fired an H&K pistol, you do not know what you are missing. The recoil system with this makes it feel like a 9mm. It is why they cost so much.

Bought this pistol new, thinking I had to have an H&K pistol. Have taken it to the range around 3 or 4 times and have fired around 10 boxes with it. Dont have much time to shoot now and 45 ammo is not cheap.

Comes with all original case and accessories (back-straps, mag loader, brush, mag holster, gun holster...) and 2 19rd mags. I have upgraded the cheap guide rod to a stainless steel guide rod. I have shot around 400rds through this and no issues at all, excellent accuracy at 10yds.

I am looking for $600 cash firm!!

For those that will say you can get a new XDM 9mm for $575, maybe you can in ALL BLACK! You will always pay extra for the stainless od.

Buds (that everyone uses to compare prices) sells this for $630 when they are in stock (which they are not) +FFL($20-$25) +guide rod($25) This is equal to $675-$680, so I am saving you a minimum of $75 if you can find it in stock for this price. If you don't like the price, don't bother! I am not trying to sound like a jerk, but there are way too many low ballers out there.

As far as trades go...


I am looking for a 10/22, nothing special, just a great condition 10/22.

Ruger LC9 or maybe another small framed 9mm.


Both trades are +cash on your end."

For those that will say you can get a new XDM 9mm for $575, maybe you can in ALL BLACK! You will always pay extra for the stainless od.

Buds (that everyone uses to compare prices) sells this for $630 when they are in stock (which they are not) +FFL($20-$25) +guide rod($25) This is equal to $675-$680, so I am saving you a minimum of $75 if you can find it in stock for this price.

The COP 357 is a 4 shot Derringer type pistol chambered for the powerful .357 Magnum round. It was designed by Robert Hillberg, based on his earlier work on the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon. It was manufactured by the now defunct COP Inc. of 3040 West Lomita Blvd., Torrance, California (COP stood for Compact Off-Duty Police). The double action weapon is only slightly larger than the typical .25 automatic pistol, which made it a good choice for a defensive weapon or a police backup gun.

Construction and operation of the COP 357

The COP 357 is quite robust in design and construction. It is made of solid stainless steel components. Cartridges are loaded into the four separate chambers by sliding a latch that ""pops-up"" the barrel for loading purposes, similar to top-break shotguns. Each of the four chambers has its own dedicated firing pin. It uses an internal hammer, which is activated by depressing the trigger to hit a ratcheting/rotating striker that in turn strikes one firing pin at a time. Older ""pepperboxes"" also used multiple barrels, but the barrels were the part that rotated. The COP 357 is unique in that it uses the ratcheting/rotating striker, which is completely internal, to fire each chamber in sequence.

Two frequent complaints about the COP 357 are that it is too heavy to be used as a backup gun, and that the trigger pull is too heavy for rapid fire—even heavier than most modern revolvers.

The weapon has appeared in numerous films, including Blade Runner, The Matrix Reloaded, and Bad Boys.

Here's the story.  I've been looking for a Armalite or DPMS AR 10 for several months- they are both out of stock- 3-8 months wait time.  Last week a fellow collector called and said he had order three of the DPMS back in December 2011- one for him and his two brothers.  Well, both brothers backed out- which left him holding the bad (and 2 AR10s).  So here I am.  I'm keeping one and selling one. 

I'm a little lite on the description because I've not picked up the rifles-the guy is out of town until 5/3/12.  I'll update w/ pics and relist once I have them both.  I thought I'd get a head start. 

If you've been wanting one of these- act quickly or wait 3-8 months.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

Due to money woes, I'm considering selling my baby.

I waited quite some time to find one of these, and it's killing me that it's prob gonna have to go, but it's an upper I can find again. The same cannot be said for the rest of my guns. Such is life/

I will find another when things stabilize, as I believe it to be the best SBR/pistol platform one can have.

It was traded for on these forums and I am the 3rd owner. rnd count is under 300.

It comes with a custom surefire brake, which was made by surefire for this short of an app. It is killer for follow ups, but as you can imagine it's doesn't make friends at the range so a KX3 will probably need to be purchased. It also has the newer LWRC flip sights, which are great.




I'm asking 1200 for the upper, 1300 for the upper with brake, and 1400 for the whole package shipped.

Hey Gents! 

Get it while you still can. up for sale is a Browning Buckmark URX. Why are these pistols so hard to find... because the are perfect.  No one ever sells the URX (and they are sold out everywhere)

This is my Stainless Angel (as I call her), a piece that is perfect for showing guys that you truly do have great taste in .22 pistols. This baby is gorgeous and fits in your hand just like that .45 you always wanted.  

I found this lady hiding out in my safe last night... laying back amongst the big boys... those are .50cal Eagles and V-Comp .44's!  

This little thing can hold her own... accurate as hell and prettier than your high school crush... she ranks up there as one of my favorite pistols that I have ever owned.  She’s got a 5 1/2"" flat slab barrel that is perfect for Target Shooting at the range or pinking.  She has a custom trigger job that rounds out at just under 3 lbs!  Nothing but the best for my personal firearms...Oh and guess what... $23.00 for 555 rounds,  that's what I call all day shooting, WOW!

Want more details? YOU GOT IT! This URX weighs just under 2.5 lbs and has amazing balance...   I have put half of a pack of .22 Federal ammo though her (just under 230 rounds to be exact).  She has literally only been taken out of her original box 4 times.  I can promise you this... every time she has ever been fired, she has been stripped down and cleaned with Zombie Blood!  

The last time I went out with my Angel I put 25 rounds though her and she shot beautifully... I field stripped and cleaned her to the max (see pics).  The internals were lightly coated in Zombie Blood and the mechanical parts that typically collect gunk with residue were also given a nice coat of ZB! 

I call it a “Z-Job”.

This little Angel is the perfect .22!  

By The Way Gents, ""THERE'S NOT EVEN A FRECKLE ON HER""! She’s as perfect as perfect gets… the ""CREAM OF THE CROP""! 

Like they say... ""Every dog has her day"" and today is the day I am deciding to let her call another man (or woman) daddy!

Price is 400.00

MUST HAVE FOID CARD 

Feel free to contact with questions or for additional pictures.

She is ready to be picked up or shipped From My Favorite FFL to Your Local Hometown Favorite Gun Shop! I ship via UPS (you pay next day shipping) No Hassel - Smooth as Silk - And Legal as Eagles! 

Gents, Thanks for Viewing!
