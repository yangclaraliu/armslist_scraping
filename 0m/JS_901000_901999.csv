When I got it was still covered in cosmline. I cleaned it up converted it, trick it out and shot about 200 rounds through it. It shoots every time works great no issues it is very accurate. The rocket launcher has been removed and a flash suppressor/muzzle break has been welded on in its place. The package includes the original stock, cleaning kit that was located in the stock, 3 mags (one metal 30 round, a ProMag plastic 40 round and a ProMag 30 round), tactical sling, a couple hundred rounds of ammo, scope, bayonet… everything in the pic except the bed.;)

BTW, the guy I got it from said it had been in his closet for 20 years and he had no idea if it was registered.

I will consider all trades. I need a 12 gauge that will shoot 3 ½ mags. I like older guns that are in good condition but I will consider anything. Cars, Bikes, other guns but I am in this for cash so make it worth my time.

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. This listing will be deleted if the gun is sold.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

I'm looking to sell my Burris AR-332 3X mag optic. Similar to the ACOG, only one less power. It has a standard black reticle, but also can be illuminated in either red or green, between 5 different brightness levels (I left the damn thing on so the batteries are now dead, but they can be changed).

As well, I upgraded the mount to an American Defense QD mount meant for the ACOG, bit it fits perfectly with this sight, and holds absolute zero if taken off to clean your rifle.

I spent just over $420 on everything, and am asking $325. I will include the original mount that the sight came with, a brand new lens-pen I bought from Cabelas, and, if you'd like, the paperwork I saved to register this product for the manufacturers warranty.

I shot a ~7inch group with this optic on my AR at 200 yards, without a bench-rest, and considering the low magnification, truly an impressive feat for the sight.

It barely even has the safety scratch yet.  This AK was built in the Russian Izhmash factory, which is the same factory that supplies the real Kalashnikovs to the Russian Army. It is not a cheap piece of worn-out junk. It has fired less than 100 rounds and looks brand new.  This model is no longer available, not that any of them are available these days. It is Russian made, includes the threaded barrel (Krinkov brake included) and front sight block with bayonet lug. It also includes the manual and original product catalog, and 1 matching 30 round polymer magazine. The Arsenal rifles are absolutely top-notch. Unlike so many others, these were quite expensive before everyone went gun crazy. Nobody has them in stock any more and it is looking more and more like they might be indefinitely unavailable if the ban gets enacted.

Bipod stud mounted in quad rail.  Folding forward pistol grip with storage compartment.  Bayonet lug.  Flip up night sights present, but no glow left in tritium tubes.  A new Israeli extractor and extractor spring were installed after purchase.  The serial number starts with GAL and the ejector lug and receiver looks great.  There have been between 350 and 500 rounds fired through the rifle since I purchased it new.  Bore is in fantastic shape.
This rifle is a combination of an AR-15 and an AK-47.  The receiver is milled and the folding stock is very solid and locks up tight, made from steel tubing and a cast aluminum butt section.  This rifle has a gas piston and a right side charging handle, that can be charged with the left hand also as it is vertically oriented.  The rifle is much more accurate than the typical AK-47 type design.  The front sight hood is a full circle, so it is easy to line up with the ar style flip 2 size peep rear sights.  There are flip up night sights but the tritium does not glow, the tritium tubes can be replaced if you search online.  
The magazines are all in very good shape and are metal, not plastic.  There are (12) 35 round magazines.  There are (5) 12 round magazines-purchased new (unused).

Please let me know what you have, what you want for it and after we establish an email connection, a couple pics would be nice too, showing any specific damage.

I'm open to AR pistols, Kel-tecs .223s, AR-15s, etc. I would also trade on a Kel-Tec Sub2000 in 9mm Glock. I would also consider full lowers, and even a stripped lower receiver.

I would be willing to put cash with the rifle if you have one of these available.

As you should be able to tell from the photos, this rifle is in excellent condition. I've only put 2-3 hundred rounds through it, and I am anal about keeping my weapons clean. 

The last picture, which is a close up on the stock, shows the only blemish on the rifle. There is a scratch in the stock, but it doesn't go through the finish, and it isn't very noticeable. 

The scope itself is only worth about $150, but it is a decent quality. The rubber armor on the the scope has gotten a bit gummy, but it is very accurate and holds zero. It is a 3-12 power, and I have been very pleased with it. 

All in all, I love this rifle, but I would rather have an AR. 

Oh, and since this is my only .17, I'll throw in a box of 50 polymer tipped Hornady V-Max cartridges. (About an 18-20 dollar box in my area.)"

It was purchased by my Great Grandfather when it was brand new and was used as a farm gun on a routine basis. So, this wasn't just a gun that sat around collecting dust. Serial Number is 524753. According to the Winchester website, the serial number shows it was manufactured in 1898. Straight up, this rifle is in rough shape but, it still fires true! In mint condition I know for a fact these are appraised at up to $15,000. However, I know this rifle is far from it and is truely in need of an owner who would apprciate its beauty.

The rifle has a full-octagon barrel and Third Style receiver with integral dust cover rail and dust cover with serrated edges. The barrel has a dovetail mounted sporting style front sight with silver bead and a sporting style rear sight. The barrel, magazine, forearm cap and receiver appear to have had the bluing stripped off and the hammer, lever and crescent buttplate are casehardened. The stock and forearm are straight grain black walnut with a varnish finish. "".22 CAL/SHORT"" is stamped in script letters on the bottom of the brass cartridge elevator. The upper receiver tang is roll-stamped ""MODEL 1873"". The serial number ""524753B"" is stamped on the lower tang between the lever latch and the tang screw. 
BBL: 22 inch octagon 
Stock: walnut 
Gauge: 22 short 
Finish: It appears that someone has attempted to strip and sand down the finish. IT WASN'T ME, thats for sure! My Grandfather did it!
Condition: Poor to Fair. This rifle was used routinly as a farm rifle for hunting, pest control, and self defense. It has character to say the least. It is missing some of the original parts such as the main springs and screws, and I think the mag tube is not original. It needs work for sure. Plenty to keep you busy. It would be great as a project or as a parts gun. I am firm on the price $750. Rifle sold AS-IN condition.

I will NOT ship this gun till I have cash in my hand thru PayPal or bank certified money order. I can only ship to a FFL address (thats the law). You must pay shipping costs through FedEx or UPS. I will NOT ship overseas. I can meet you here in Ohio within reason if you live here. I had this up for $1500 before and everyone said it was too much. Then I dropped it to $500, but everyone said it was too low. So, here is the price for good. I will take no lower."

Bought this revolver new many years ago, no idea where the box or instructions are.  I'm not sure if I ever shot it or not - looks like I haven't.

Factory wood stocks, no blemishes.

Blue Finish - Looks as close to 100% as possible.  No wear, never carried in a holster.

Rear sight is drift adjustable.

Having some trouble pricing it correctly as the closest thing I could find was on Gun Broker (NIB) with as asking price of $350.  Seems high to me.

Apparently H & R does not make revolvers anymore. Doubt it has much if any collector value. Still if this is the type of handgun you are looking for, this is a safe queen in excellent condition.  Would make a decent kit gun for fishing, hunting and general plinking.  

Willing to offer it at $250.  Requires FTF transaction to a person 21 years of age or older, as required for the purchase of a handgun."

My favorite enhanced parts are the quick detach sling points on the lower receiver itself, the ambidextrous mag release, the pressure fit upper/lower so there is zero slop, and the very beveled magwell including milled grips in the front of it. 

Includes 30rd magazine and I can give you a good deal on extra mags as well. I can sell a small amount of ammo if you need it.

In person: Cash only. I can meet you at your bank if you'd like and bring a bill of sale with the serial number of the rifle on it. If you have USAA we can meet there and you can do a direct transfer for free to my account. I will need to see your Texas Drivers License or CHL. If we are meeting face to face you do not need to email me anything.

For Texas residents: You must email me a picture of your TEXAS Driver's license as well as a signed and dated statement that you are legally allowed to buy a rifle"
