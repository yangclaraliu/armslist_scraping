The gun is in great condition. All bluing is intact and there are no scratches or wear marks that I can find. Although I bought it used, I don't think it saw very much use at all. I have put a few hundred rounds through it with no malfunctions. This style of gun sometimes has problems with light primer strikes. That doesn't seem to be an issue with this one, as I have had zero malfunctions in the time I've had it."

Steel case. 1380 rounds are in 20-round packs. The rest (approximately 1500 rounds) is loose. Loose ammo was counted by weight, and rounded down to the nearest 100 to make sure you're getting a fair deal. Loose ammo is 99% FMJ, but there are a few JHP mixed in from boxes that I opened accidentally. 20-round packs are mixed JHP and FMJ--I have not taken them all out to count how many of each there are. Polymer dry-boxes are included at no additional charge.

This ammo sells for between $0.23 and $0.25 per round, plus shipping, in bulk quantity online. My price works out to $0.17 per round, and zero shipping. This ammo is as fresh as the day it was made, but since it's a private party sale, I'm well aware nobody is going to pay new-in-box prices. This will be a real steal to somebody who shoots a lot of 7.62x39.

I would prefer to sell this locally, to avoid you having to pay shipping on it, but I am willing to ship it wherever you like, as long as you're willing to pay the shipping :-)"

I Bought this as unfired from a guy who never ended up getting his carry permit as originally planned. Comes with a nice safariland holster, 3 mags, Warren tactical sighs, and an extended slide release. This also has the Ghost 3.5 lb trigger installed. All extras were stated to have been performed by Scheels in Des Moines IA area, although I have no way to verify this. Perfect condition, it has not been fired. I will ship it with original sights and original slide release in case you prefer that. 530 includes the cost of shipping. The holster is a model 568-83 in perfect condition. Available for pickup or ships to your ffl. IA residents pay tax. Shipped usps priority, insured for 530. Will consider trades but looking to sell. Thanks. PS look me up on gunbroker (kdave21) or on ebay (luckyfromiowa) to check my ratings...all A+. As with all guns, have inspected by competent gunsmith prior to using.

In case you're wondering, here is what the extras cost

Warren Tactical Sights = $60
Ghost 3.5 Ultimate Trigger = $ 22.99
Holster = about $40
Slide stop release w/spring = $14.99

It is built to very tight tolerences, and is designed to shoot accurately out to 50 yards with nearly any type of ammo.
 As were most Unit match pistols, it was built from military parts, on an Essex frame.  The Essex frames were used because of their superior steel qualities ( over frames that were built in the 1940s ) , and the fact that the finished pistols could follow the Soldier to his next duty station, because the pistol belonged to him, rather than the US Government.
  The pistol has a WWII Remington Rand slide, GI National Match Barrel, National Match Bushing, Aluminum adjustable trigger, flattened and serrated mainspring housing, BO-MAR fully adjustable rear sight, National Match front sight, and a lightened GI Hammer and a Throated barrel . All of the pins are polished bright on the right side of the pistol ( this was about the only fancy cosmetic thing on these pistols ) .  It would cost over $1500 to have this work done on your pistol today....PLUS the pistol !  The bushing to  barrel, and slide to frame fit is very tight. Pistol is parkerized. These pistols were made to allow you to hit what you are aiming at !! Feel free to ask questions . No Calif sales. Face to face in OK. with OK drivers lisc. FFL required outside OK."

This fall, the shots will likely be in the 2-300yd range...so, rather than bubba up my Enfield to mount a scope, ask my 77/44 to do something its not comfortable with, or spend big bucks on a new rifle...I'm gonna beat the bushes here and see what arises. Doesn't have to be pretty, since I don't baby my hunting guns....but should be capable of holding its own accuracy-wise as long as I do my part, and be capable of having a scope mounted. 

I'm looking for something in .30-06 or .308 preferably, but would also take a sporterized 1917, 1903, Enfield or Mosin. I'm really not looking to spend a ton of dough, otherwise I'll just go new and put it on the card - which I would rather avoid.

ALL CHEAPER THAN THE STORE!!!
We are selling a huge amount of men's clothing at very reasonable prices. These clothes came from Iowa, the man, who is deceased now, was a compulsive buyer. If he needed one pair of jeans he purchased 6 and wore only one, stored the others. We are selling for his widow. He was a ""real"" man, his jeans run from 42x30 to 54x30, shirts, coats and jackets run from 2x through some 5 and 6x. Boots are all 10 1/2 and 11, mostly 11. These are brand new, most have tags on them, some, evidentely he took the tags off, but never wore. Anyone wearing these sizes need to check the prices on the clothes page in this website. Plan on attending and purchasing clothes for the year! If you have someone you purchase gifts for in these sizes, now is the time to buy them and store them till needed!

Make: Colt

Model: 1911

Serial Number: 93700

Year of Manufacture: 1914

Caliber: .45 ACP

Action Type: Semi Auto, Magazine Fed

Markings: The left side of the slide is marked “Patented Apr. 20. 1897.Sept.9.1902 / Dec.19.1905.Feb.14.1911.Aug.1913”, and “Colt’s PT.F.A. Mfgt. Co. / Hartford, CT. U.S.A.”. and a rampant Colt no circle. The right side of the slide is marked “Model of 1911 U.S.Army”. The back of the slide is marked “H”, for Frank Hosmer. The left side of the frame is marked “United States Property”. Behind the trigger is the stamp for Walter G. Penfield (Jan 21911-Sept. 30, 1914) . The top of the receiver is marked “H” for Frank Hosmer, and “b”, for Jas Malloy. The markings on the frame and slide are correct. The barrel has markings “Colt 45 Auto”, and “P” on the lug. These barrel markings are for pistols from serial number 710,000- 1945.

Barrel Length: 5”

Sights / Optics: This pistol is mounted with standard military sights. A blade front sight and a notch in a dovetail rear sight.

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are correct diamond pattern checkered wood. The checkering has become smooth. There are compression marks and wear on both panels and some smoothing/rounding at the bottoms but there are no chips cracks or losses. The grips rate in about Good overall condition.

Type of Finish: Blue

Finish Originality: The finish is likely an old re-blue. There is some pitting under the blue on the top of the slide.

Bore Condition: The bore is a little gray and the rifling is sharp and deep. There is mild erosion in the flats. The bore is very shootable.

Overall Condition: This pistol retains about 40% of its metal finish. The entire surface has become mottled with mixed patches of blue and wear down to the brown colored metal. There are a few patches of surface rust, on both sides of the frame above and around the trigger guard, and on the right side at the hammer. There is a small amount of surface rust on the left front of the slide and above the ejection port. The barrel shows wear and finish loss on the top surface at the lugs extending to the back of the barrel. The magazine shows its correct two tone finish with some pinprick erosion on the sides. There are some dings along the backstrap. The Screw heads are sharp and not disfigured. The markings are clear. Overall, this gun rates in about Good condition especially for its age.

Mechanics: The action functions correctly. We have had this pistol apart several times and it is functionally correct. We did not fire this pistol.

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: One correct two tone magazine with lanyard ring is provided.

Our Assessment: This is a correct 1914 U.S. marked Colt 1911 except for the barrel. The grips, frame, inspector marks, magazine, all correctly check out, only the barrel is not original manufacture. However, the barrel is correct Colt from serial number 710,000 all the way to 1945. So this is still be an all “U.S.” pistol."

Stainless 24” barrel with the 1 in 48” twist that does a great job of handling either the round ball or maxi style hunting bullet.  Did a Google search before pricing to find that this model could be the most popular sidelock traditional style hunting rifle they ever made.  It seems to have a semi-collector value that runs between $250-300+ that is evident looking at the GB closed auctions.  It’s in excellent little used condition with an excellent bore that looks like new.  You can drop a AAA mag lite down the barrel to get a good look at its condition.  With 120 grains of powder and the maxi bullet this is a romper stomper high energy hunting load that I have taken 5 Elk with in other rifles.  I do not have the box, paperwork (you can get it online in pdf form) or any accessories at the price of $240.  I do have everything it takes to shoot this or other blackpowder rifles that I will sell at whatever the going rate is used (usually 65% of new price).

I take an interest in AK's, m4's, m16's (ar's), stey aug's or similar, m1 garands, m1 carbines, FN FALs, etc. Pretty much assault style weapons. And I LOVE H&K's. I will pretty much take anything H&K. However I guess I'm kinda simple on those because I would much rather have the USP 45 over the HK45 but what I would like most is an HK USP .45c or compact. But I would pretty much take the compact in any caliber. When it comes to other pistols, I like military style or grade pistols such as Glocks, Beretta m9's 92fs 96, 1911's (bare bone 1911A1 style), etc. I also like snubbies sometimes but I lean more towards the ruger LCR style .357's or .38 spl. Just let me know what you've got and I'll let you know if I'm interested. Would also partially trade with cash if you don't have enough guns to reach this value. My bike runs great. It has cobra pipes, 12,000 miles, nice seats, some old saddle bags, two sets of handle bars. Any questions, let me know.  

What I want most of all is a Colt Single Action Army style pistol. Just about any Ruger Vaquero or Beretta Stampede or similar will do. Just let me know. By the way, I don't like ruger redhawks, or black hawks they are ugly sporterized versions of the SAA."

Im selling my ak47 rifle thats is a preban polytech imported from china and made USA compliant in arizona as marked on the rifle in the picture. The barrell is threaded which is nice you have alot of options of what you can do to it but i have kept the A2 birdcage muzzle on it unchanged since i bought it, i will also be throwing in for a deal the ak47 trident 3 tipped muzzle break ($40) with it that i later bought but didnt put on. The stock is a double steel underfolder which makes it all the more fun to shoot. In the front is the bayonette lug with bayonet which is also an underfolder. I personally liked the bipod attached to it when i shot it as seen in the pic but these semi auto rifles dont need a bipod i just thought it looked badass. I will throw in 3 steel ribbed 30 round preban magazines in mint condition ( and ammo for them) and if the buyer wants more i have 1 more 30 round mag and 1 40 round preban NYS complaint magazine thats black steel ribbed that i will sell seperately. I also have a stash of brown bear 143 grain ammo for it for the taking at a dirt cheap price, just ask if you want the extras. This is smooth, powerfull, accurate and most importantly has never jammed with the 400 rounds i have put threw it at the fish and game club. For a 1987 preban this true ak47 rifle is more reliable than these new guns stores are selling and i really really hate to sell it and i dont want to lose even a dollar on a rare gun like this but the house is more important right now. Serious buyers only please, I would consider trading for a newer springfield m14/m1a with black fiberglass stock, not preban wooden stock, i want newer. this wont last long. Make an offer. Thanks"

418,http://www.armslist.com/posts/468418,For Sale:  Arsenal Arms SA M7-SF,"Farragut / Hardin Valley, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 900,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 24, 2012",Rifles,no type,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is an Arsenal arms SA M7-SF. It is an AK pattern rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm. It has a milled receiver and a skeleton, side-folding stock. Arsenal is American importer and manufacturer of Bulgarian AKs. These are, hands-down, the best AKs you can buy in America.

Arsenal has stopped making milled receiver side-folders, so the value of these guns has increased in recent years. NIB examples regularly sell for around $1500. This gun has right around 1000 ounds through it, so it's certainly not NIB, but 1000 rounds in the life of an AK is nothing to speak of. If you're concerned, I'll give you $30 for a new recoil spring!

EDIT: The ad previously indicated the gun had ""no more than 2000"" rounds through it. I found the receipts in my email for the bulk purchases of ammo that I made when I first bought the gun, and was able to subtract out how many I had left to determine a more accurate round count. That is why the round count has gone down.

The gun has a receiver-mounted scope rail and a cheap Bushnell red dot sight (resale value: $0) that I'm including. I also have a five-round magazine that I will throw in for free, in case you want to take the gun deer hunting or something else where there is a magazine restriction.

EDIT: The 30-round magazines that I had previously described have sold separately and are no longer part of the sale.

The site will only let me put up three pictures, so I have one overall view, and then the remaining two, I have focused on the two areas where there is wear on the gun, so you can assess its condition accurately. The one area is the bolt carrier, where the paint is worn. This is just normal use, from firing the gun. The other area is some wear on the stock, again, from normal use.

This gun is difficult to price accurately, because it may have collector's value to some buyers, but not to others. I am entertaining all offers, so if you think it is priced incorrectly, please feel free to open negotiations with me.

EDIT TO ADD: Also included with the gun are a soft-sided carrying case, a 6-magazine over-shoulder carry bag, and a silicone-impregnated ""gun sock"" for storage.

EDIT TO ADD: I am not looking for any other guns in trade right now. I would consider trade on tractor implements such as: hay spear, yard rake, finish mower (for 3-point-hitch), pallet forks. I have a pin-on bucket, not quick-attach, so QA attachments won't work for me."

In good shape for an issue used scope, has some scratches and a small amount of overspray from when rifle was painted but nothing close to the turrets or lenses. Both front and rear glass are clear and in great shape.  This is a sought after and collectible item for anyone who shoots or collects the M24 Sniper Rifle stuff.  Scope is set up for M118 ammo but will work with most .308/7.62x51.  This is a unique opportunity to own a piece of military history or a nice Leupold scope to throw on your bolt gun.  SN: 89 1402  you can contact Leupold and ensure that it is the real deal.  Only reason I'm letting this go is to fund another variable power optic, otherwise I would keep this in my collection. It is hard to determine a price on this since they are not for sale anymore or were never as far as I know for sale to the public.  I did some research and found that they went for anywhere from 750-1000. So I priced it on the lower end to account for the shape and age, even though I feel it is in very good shape for the age and fact that it was a issue item.  I am open to offers, contact me for more info. I am having issues loading photos so just e-mail me and I can send them to your e-mail or cell phone. Thanks for looking!"

Had it mounted ... played with it a bit ... but not mounted on a fired rifle.
This is a Dual Laser System.
Both Red and Infrared Lasers.
For night vision and CQB applications.
Small enough for a Pistol and solid enough for an SBR or CQB application.
It cost me $1100 to have it custom made by someone who did work for special groups, agency and the military when special applications required.

The adjustments are on the laser itself via Allen wrench.
It is a bit novel ... Aluminum framed with Picatinny Weaver rail.

Uses Common A544 4LR44 Alkaline Battery

Built very tough.

Extra Battery Included.

This was a custom made item. If you are serious ... I will talk with you via phone.
Just ask Questions if you need more info. I also have a very good rep on a Local Oregon Gun Site.

I don't know the exact specs as I had it fabricated to be a 200 - 300 meter Ir laser.
Originally it was intended to have dual IR lasers with wide and narrow field ... however ""it was decided"" to have CQB Red and Night Vision IR.

So ... If it doesn't sell within reason ... back in the safe it goes or I will mate it with some new digital NV gear that is new spec.

Designed in close cooperation with Billie Joe, the signature guitar is modeled closely after ""Floyd,"" Billie Joe's original 1956 Les Paul Junior. With a mahogany body and neck and nickel hardware, the Billie Joe Armstrong Les Paul Junior combines the best features of a vintage Junior with some modern twists. With a special design double-coil P-90 and a vintage correct non-compensated wraparound bridge, the Billie Joe Armstrong is a ferocious, resonant rock 'n' roll guitar, truly worthy of Billie Joe's name.

Since emerging from the close-knit punk scene of California's East Bay in the early 1990s, Green Day have evolved into one of the most popular and creatively ambitious rock 'n' roll bands of all time. Frontman Billie Joe Armstrong - drawing on the buzz saw guitar of the Ramones and Husker Du and the raw poetics of the Replacements' Paul Westerberg - has evolved over the years into a fiercely distinctive guitarist and songwriter. Combining melodic chord voicing with a blistering, jackhammer rhythm, Armstrong's playing deftly underscores the mood and theme of his songs. Buoyed by one of rock's truly great rhythm sections-bassist Mike Dirnt and drummer Tre Cool-Armstrong has proven just how much can be accomplished with one guitar, bass, and drums. From the swinging dynamics of the band's 1994 breakthrough hit ""Longview"" to the staggering Who-like sprawl of 2004's amazing American Idiot, Green Day have honored the traditions of their influences while taking stripped-down rock 'n' roll to dizzying creative heights.

Price Drop: $500 for the entire package

Considering any offer, looking for AR parts...

I'm selling a Ruger LCR in 38 special +P.  I'm the second owner and I have never fired it.  The original owner put 30 rounds thru it.  Listed below are the items included.  At this time, I would like to to sell it all together in one package.

I have the original box, Ruger bag, lock, books, and factory fired round.  The box has gotten wet, so it looks bad, but it still works. The original owner had a gunsmith put on the XS Sight system (front sight).  This is way better than the original sight, but the original sight will come with the package as well. 

LCR 38 special +P: ~$400 plus
XS Sight: $60
70 Rounds of Winchester white box ammo: ~$20
40 Rounds of Federal low recoil home defense ammo: ~$50
Leather belt holster: ~$30
Fobus Ankle Holster: ~$35

Components:
400 X-Treme Plated Bullets 38/357, Flat Nose, 125 grain: $42/500, so ~$34
Approx 300 Once Fired Brass, cleaned, un-primed: ~$15
(3) 100 round ammo storage boxes: ~$8
Set of 38 special Lee Dies: ~$35

That totals around $690.  I will sell the entire package for $500 cash.  Please call or text me at 765 Five Two Four 1943.  I'm willing to travel within reason, since I travel around the state fairly regular for my work. Will need to see an Indiana DL and prefer to see a valid Indiana Carry permit."

This is from Glock's website: GLOCK introduced the G22 .40 in 1990 and effectively closed the gap between the heavy .45 Auto, and the internationally proven 9x19.

First we have the BRAND NEW in box M&P 15-sport .223/5.56. Original oil from the factory, never been disassembled. I am the original owner.

$700 come get it! 

everything that it came with in the box is still there..but you will receive a ORlite polymer mag NOT the Magpul P-mag. The Orlite is still very nice and light. + instruction manual, mag lock, bot flag, and other papers + original box. Buyer will get 30 rounds of brass ammo too.


Next we have a very very nice Norinco SKS 7.62x39 that has a Tactical Tapco stock with 6 position adjustable shoulder. Includes one steel 3 round mag + FOUR new Tapco 20 round mags.

The gun is in overall good condition. Not perfect. There are some minor scrapes and a few bruises because this gun has been my run-n-gun gun for almost 6 months now. A little on the heavy side with the rail but I'm not very small. Haha! But it has performed flawlessly! Even in the most adverse conditions it has brought it's A-game. Rain, sleet, snow, mud, sand; I've played in it all with this particular weapon. With almost 2000 rounds through it I have had zero (yes, zero) failures to eject, failures to fire or failures to feed. If you're in to the whole ""show gun"" type deal then move your mouse cursor to the ""back"" button and step away from the ad, because this gun isn't for you. But if you're like me and enjoy using your rifle.. this rifle will definitely be worthwhile!

Just know the components used to build this rifle are not cheap. Any AR-15 guy will see that only quality components went into this build. It is a purpose built weapon platform.

Product Description

So far as we can tell, this is the first manufactured Mossberg 500/590 quad rail produced and what a great piece! This Mossberg rail is the last word in quality accessorizing.


Prepare to be blown away, because this is the real deal. As you can see by the pics, the piece is beautiful and entirely functional. The piece now allows any accessory that can fit on a rifle to now be mounted on the Mossberg 500/590. Even the 590A1! The RB7M quad rail system features:


One piece T6 6061 construction
Small 14 ounce weight!!
Type 2 black anodizing
Full install kit with tools

Serial number remains visible! In many states it's a crime to obscure the serial number of any firearm, and our rails do not obscure the serial numbers whatsoever!

Normal retail is a whopping $269-$359 on rails that are far heavier and are of less quality!!

Mossberg 590A1 pictured is not for sale, but we can duplicat. Contact us for details.


____________________________________________________________


Here's the best part. These items are made in America! We support American companies and American workers!!!


No gunsmitthing required! This rail will fit both tapped and untapped receivers, both. Install time take under 10 minutes from the time the rail is removed from the box to the time the shotgun is ready to fire. We even supply the tools and instructions! Bayonet lugs on the 590A1 should be lightly narrowed for the best fit. Oem heat shields should be removed as our rail replaces it. 20"" barrel is shown. We recommend an 18"" minimum barrel length. Works with both shorter and extended mags!


*** A side note. The clamp system in this kit sees 100% of the shock associated with every round fired. It is of the utmost importance that the clamp be as tight as possible so as not to move backwards. Loctite and frequent checking of the clamps is recommended. If the clamp works loose, all of the energy is transferred to the pins and screws, which are not meant to see that level of shock. ***"

It's a .38 special with a 3 and 1/4 inch barrel. I've taken the time to look up the history on this handgun and have learned that it was a standard police issue INA revolver. Well it doesn't really specify on the gun the name however it has a tiger stamp on the frame. 

Here is a youtube video that explains this firearm in detail:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHFlJ3x1X_c 

Anyhow, it's a single/double action 5 shot .38 Special. It still fires excellent as I have fired it many times and shows great accuracy for a revolver. It does have a few rust patches here and there for it being 50+ years old, however, none that are in the barrel or the cylinder. All exterior.

I'm honestly not much of a revolver fan. It's good to have around the house but I would much rather have a semi-auto pistol. I'm looking for trade more than sell. I'm looking to trade for a pocket sized (ankle holster) .380. However, I may be open to other calibers. Please be reasonable about your trade. Willing to meet in person.

The revolver also comes with a box of lead point rounds AND a box of Hornady Critical Defense hollow points (non +P)

It is stainless with the black polymer body, and comes with the original case, lock, manual, and even the casing from the test round. The only difference in this and a new one is that I won't have to charge you sales tax.  I bought it a few months back but have decided to go with the SR9C so that my wife can shoot with me (she's not a fan of the 40 cal). 

 Buyer must have a valid pistol permit or CCW to purchase locally, and if you are in another state I must ship to an FFL dealer. No California or New York sales.   Thanks for looking"
