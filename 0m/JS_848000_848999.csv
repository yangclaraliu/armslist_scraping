Anyway here's a list of what I have first a mag latch for the 591m second is a trigger gaurd for the 591m I believe it also works on the 592m Third I have 2 take down screws for the 592m I believe they work on the 591m as well. Fourth I have over 10 extractors for the Remington 591m / 592m. 5mm only will not work on any other gun. Interestingly theese are original not the knock offs numrech is selling. I have both types of the extractors the earlier rifles came with a slightly different model while the later rifles came with the model numrech currently has for sale. Fifth I have 2 firing pins for the 591m / 592m. Sixth I have a Remington 591m latch spring. To my knowledge alot of the parts I have aren't available anywhere and the ones that are not from the 70's the parts I have were all purchased factory new in the 70's by a gunsmith and never used. If I can help anyone get there Remington 591m / 592m back up and running please let me know, as theese rifles are treasures and should be shared with future generations. Thanks"

I'm now living in an area with no public trap fields and really don't know any other trap enthusiasts.

A removable wire shell catcher is included with this shotgun.  So simple and works great for catching hulls for reloading and avoiding hitting the opponent to your right with the empty hull!

This one has very nice wood and is in excellent condition.  A crack in the stock where it meets the rear of the receiver occurred long ago and was repaired.  No trouble with it since I have owned the gun.  (Replacement stocks are available if you wanted to replace the stock.  Also, Rem 870 stocks fit too!).  

I am the second owner.  The original owner never hunted with it and really didn't shoot the gun much.  The gun is tight and shows little wear.  It is the rare TB model made for trap shooting and has a 2 3/4"" chamber and a 30"" barrel.

1st and only owner, store bought at Gander Mountain in Watertown NY in 2004. I purchased it during my time in the Army so the rifle was meticulously cared for and cleaned. There are very few signs that this rifle was ever used. 

It was always stored in my closet, never lent out, only ever fired under my supervision. Less than 500 rounds in it's life. 

The closest version made today sells at $909 before tax. Add ammo and magazine, tax etc, you are up to around $1300 pretty quick. I'm selling for $1000 non negotiable. Available for pickup in Austin at my home. If you'd like to meet at a range and take a test shot I can meet you on Saturday Monday or Tuesday at Lonestar Gun Range in Lockhart."

Low-profile, flattop-mounted, polymer sights deploy instantly at the touch of a finger to provide backup sighting if a primary optic fails. Streamlined contours mean there’s nothing to snag on brush, sling, or other gear when folded. Spring-loaded ambidextrous release mechanism lets you hit the grooved tab on either side of the sight to deploy, and lock it in place. Hitting the same tabs retract the sight when you’re done. Uses less than 1"" of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny receiver rail space and locks securely in place with the included steel crossbolt. Provides the same height over bore as standard A2 iron sights. Windage-adjustable rear sight has two apertures: a large, .185"" peep and a .070"" peep. Designed for AR-type rifles and carbines, fits any weapon with Picatinny rails. Front sight must be mounted on a railed forend on the same plane as the receiver rail to witness correctly with rear sight. Not compatible with railed gas blocks or the MOE handguard.

Probably a few things I'm forgetting. I have shot a few sub M.O.A. groups with this rifle. This rifle is done / complete, sighted in and ready to shoot!! See below for guns I'm willing to take as partial trade or make an offer for multiple guns on my list and maybe we can work something out for the full package. I'm not looking for a straight across trade for any one firearm. Cash is still the best. Please don't ask my bottom dollar. Send me your top dollar and I will consider it and politely reply.

It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction, a pop off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti tilt, self lubricating follower for increased reliability.

The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine.

The Gen 2 revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips, and the Impact/Dust Cover can now be snapped onto the floorplate when not in use to prevent possible loss. Along with larger windows and round count numbers on the body, the PMAG MagLevel's stainless steel magazine spring is now coated with mil spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color.

Not to mention the gun dealers that set up, talk about nothing but a bunch of traitor turn coats they are.

As i was looking over a guys table, some black lady was looking also, and she actually asked the guy if he was able to take credit cards, he said yes, she then went to ask if he could run her  ""OHIO DIRECTIONS CARD "" he was,  what is that, I was like WTH, it was her welfare card, she was trying to buy a rifle with her welfare card.

When he told no, that would be illegal also, she actually got pissed that he wouldn't.

This bushing, when installed in a MkIII or MkIII 22/45 will remove the 'magazine disconnect' and allow firing/dry firing of the gun when the magazine is NOT inserted. I, along with a slew of other people(other than ruger's lawyers....), believe this to be advantageous. Trigger pull will also be improved, and the magazine will drop free when the magazine release is pressed. 

Make an offer. I got two of these by mistake. I am not a gunsmith, but can install/guide you to install this in your gun. It took me about 7 minutes."
