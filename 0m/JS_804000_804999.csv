Senate sponsors could not find the votes for HB815 and HB1263 before recessing for the weekend. However, that has not stopped Gov. Quinn and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel from trying to pass a Chicago-style gun ban during the lame duck session.
The House will reconvene Sunday evening at 5 pm. and we expect a strong push to pass the gun ban and get it back to the Senate for vote before the deadline on Wed., Jan. 9.
The bills will include banning most semi-auto handguns, rifles, and shotguns, plus restrictions on public shooting ranges that will close most if not all ranges in Illinois.

Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability. Tthe Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense. 

Features:

■Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
■Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
■Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
■3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
■Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
■External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
■Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
■Magazine: High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. 
■Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.
■No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
■Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
■Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction).

Like new, test fired and sighted in, low round count.
Comes with original box, and all accessories in box at time of purchase. Also comes with Blackhawk 3pt sling, and carry handle scope mount. If I haven't sold my other AR accessories and scope by the time this sells I might just include them. That includes a free float quad rail and scope.
I came to my price by looking at gunshows and local retailers to see what they are wanting for similar guns. The last AR I saw on the shelf of a retailer in Iowa City was a similar gun, but in much worse condition. It had no box, no accessories, and looked beat up. They wanted only slightly less than what I am asking.
Get this before they ban 'em and ban private sales. I'm going to medical school and need money  more than a rifle right now.

Of particular interesting reading is this paragraph:
""For instance, this person suggested, Wal-Mart and other major gun retailers may have an incentive to support closing a loophole that allows people to bypass background checks if they purchase firearms at gun shows or through other types of private sales. That could result in more people buying guns in retail stores.""

Basically what they are saying is they are going to make using sites like this one illegal to use to sell guns privately, making it a crime to do so.  Thats how they will take our guns away--people caught selling or trading will instantly become criminals, and their guns seized. 
First off screw Walmart--an immediate boycott should start if they go along with this--and you know they will. Second now more than ever we need to overwhelm our senators and congressmen about how we feel and stop this before it gains any traction.  Not one little email, but several from each of us--spread this around to your friends too.  I know some of you live on this website looking to snatch up deals, so take a few minutes to help SAVE OUR COUNTRY from these liars, thieves, and liberal Nazis."

article about the cyberdome2 
The past few weeks of harsh winter weather already has students dreaming of the warmer temperatures, sunny beaches and brown bodies associated with spring break. If you're thinking of getting a jump start on that base tan, there is a new tanning unit available. The Cyber Dome 2, a new bed from the Wolff Tanning Industry, is said to tan faster than any other bed on the market. ""The neat thing about the Cyber Dome 2 is that it tans several layers deep,"" said Charlie Gwinn, manager of the new Co-Ed Tanning Salon. ""This allows the customer to make less visits and still get the optimal tanning effect."" Customers would only have to tan once every two weeks, Gwinn said. Triangular UV wavelength integration, the process the Cyber Dome 2 uses, is just an accelerated tanning process, Gwinn said. ""The beds use high output lamps with a higher content of UVA and UVB rays,"" Gwinn said. that a person visits daily."

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

The second?

A Hungarian AMD-65. This is a TGI built gun with a Hungarian receiver. These were the sub-gun, tanker guns. Folding stock that locks up rock-solid. I have the original polymer grips as well as the Ironwood, US-Made wood grips as pictured. These rifles are still in use with the Afgan-police. They are a favorite of contractors in Iraq, because they are so light and quick. The factory heat shield readily accepts bolt on rail pieces for add-ons. This will include (1) Tapco 20-round mag and (2) Hungarian 20-round mags (or can substitute two - thirties- your choice.) Price: $950.

I will also have two cases of ammo, many mags and a unused drum mag as pictured. I will be selling the ammo, extra mags and drum ONLY after the two rifles are sold. The purchaser of a rifle may buy up to half the mag & ammo stock, at their preference.

I'm in NE Indy. I can meet partway for the right deal. All pictures taken today. No phone calls, please. Email only. You must be an Indiana resident and not a ""prohibited person"" as defined by the laws of this State. I'm NOT a dealer or business. I have no FFL and this comes from my personal collection. I'm NOT desperate to sell - if I do sell, I'm going to be financing a N-I-C-E piece of glass for one of my ARs. Fortunately, there are no plans for scopes to be potentially banned or otherwise prohibited, so I've got plenty of time.

Oh, I actually HAVE these mags in hand. Please see the picture for this sale. This is what REAL Brownell mags look like. This is for local sale, no credit cards, or any other nonsense. Just an old school sale. Read the Brownells description:
A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Choose from a mil-spec stainless steel spring."

$1000 obo NO LOW BALLING

As for the person/people creating a post to mock mine... The 454 Casull is not comparable in price to that of the 44 magnum Super Redhawk. The 454 is more $ everywhere you go. Also, this is the target grey model which is no longer in production and is considered collectable. These are going for $850 (very few mind you) used on gunbroker without anything with them!!! Mine comes with 3 different grips ($100), Fire Sights ($45), Leather Holster ($100), Scope rings ($40), and a box of ammo ($40)... My listing is $1000 OBO!!! If you do not like the price, shut your mouth, move on, and do not buy it. Educate yourself in gun values and proper etiquette amongst fellow gun owners!
