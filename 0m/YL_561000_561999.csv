Barrels have been professionally broken in with 60 rounds of Federal 55 Grain ammo and rifles then cleaned. The sights are adjusted to hit on paper at 100 yards, but have not been zeroed. I have personally shot 20 extra rounds through each of these since I've had them, a total of 80 rounds through each of these rifles... they are practically brand new and let me tell you, they are nice! There is slight wear on the DuraCoat, seeing as they were assembled in Texas then shipped here to Arizona and I have no proper gun safe to store them in, but they are 100% mechanically sound!

I've babied this rifle for years, has clean sharp rifling, good wood, and is sub -MOA with even Russian ammo. It's taken my first deer, coyote, bobcat, and with Barnes ammo, it can take deer, hogs, coyotes etc. at decent range. It's been my go to rifle for hunting on foot, and doubles as a bet winner on the farm! It's no problem to hit consistently with this lil guy inside of 400 yds (never used it further). It's the first bolt gun I ever owned, and it would do well as a truck/varmint/predator/deer/hog gun for a small kid, or even a fun gun for an adult.

This is the flat top with adjustable front and rear sights, a ""Target"" model? The cylinder locks up REAL tight, the bore is shiny and the rifling is surpisingly sharp.

I bought this handgun in the late 1970's new as I have always been a Mauser fan and this was the last of the HSc models to be made.  It is offered as I received it with the presentation box, extra magazine, owner's manual, barrel brush, and Factory 3 shot test firing target.  I am also including my Bianchi belt holster.

The HSc is in excellent condition having been fired not that much, somewhere in the low hundreds rounds.  It has always been a reliable loader, able to handle both roundnose and hollow point ammunition.  I loaded most of what I shot myself and found, like a lot of semi autos, it likes a heavier load.  The only loading issues I had was in firing low power lead rounds.

The only flaw found is on the right side of the slide between the American Crest and the serial number are a few pinpoint impressions made when I got clumsy one time.  They are very hard to see, small and can be felt only by my fingernail, not finger pad.

Bluing is excellent, barrel is excellent, and it's all here.  A nice collectible that is also a great carry."

This pistol is also sometimes referred to as a Model 1906. This pistol was designed by John Browning and sold in Europe. Colt had the rights to manufacture this gun in the States. That gun was known as the Colt 1908 Vest Pocket. 

This gun shows 90% or better bluing remaining intact with wear on the usual high spots. No gouges or pitting on the metal. Perfect working order. Comes with two mags. The grips are in excellent condition and are original to the gun. 
Inside and out, this gun is a real beauty of old world machining and craftsmanship. 

The gun has ""GECO"" engraved on the front strap in block letters.  ""GECO"" stands for a German manufacturer and distributor of ammunition and small arms in Berlin. Here is some more info on them:

http://geco-munition.de/en/geco-world/brand.html

So, based on the serial number of this gun, 9956XX, it was made in the 30's, right before WWII started (German invasion of Poland) and was sold in Germany. How it got here to the US, I have no idea. But I am sure it has seen some things in its day. 

Will sell for $450 or perhaps trade for a nice revolver."

The action is late '50s and the stock is a 70s era silhouette stock. Metal and blueing are great; there are no mars, rusting, or scratches. The bolt looks a bit more used but is in excellent shape and was in no way abused. The trigger is awesome. 

A small piece of the stock chipped off when the rear swivel was installed, but it has since been repaired. I have only fired various match grade ammunition through it, about 400 rounds while it's been in my possession. I do not know the history of the rifle before me, but whoever owned it treated it like gold. 

I am selling because, as much as I love this rifle, I have no need for something of its caliber (pun unintended). It is an awesome rifle and will outshoot me all day, but is too heavy for my uses. Besides, I'd feel bad sending the barrel to Adco to get it threaded for my can. 

I will include the rear sling mount, the front bipod block, the scope mount, and the scope with the rifle. Scope mount is of unknown origin but has been extremely solid during its tenure with me. Scope is a Japanese Tasco 4-16 that I never got around to replacing. It's an all right scope but the rifle really deserves better. 

Please contact me via email with any questions or picture requests. Price HAS BEEN REDUCED and is negotiable within reason.  I will take trades in the form of lighter .22lr rifles, and I'm looking specifically for a Savage MkII TR or a TacSol-ed 10/22. Threaded is a plus. If you've got anything else, send it my way and we'll talk. It never hurts to ask."

I have too many guns and I never got around to shooting this one. When I sold this gun to my brother, he has only fired 15 rounds (2 mags) through it before selling it back to me.

The warrior will come with all of the original packaging/contents, vz and stock grips, ed brown maxi well and stock MSH, brand new CMC 10rd mag, wilson 47D 8rd mag, and a 100rd box of 45acp. SUREFIRE X300 NOT INCLUDED. I REPEAT, *NOT INCLUDED*.

The only mods done are two simple upgrades. Ed brown hardcore leaf spring and hard core extractor. The barrel bushing/cap has been polished silver. The barrel bushing is machined stainless so it will not rust easy. There is a very little bit of paint wear on the edge of the rail of the kimber. That is from me slipping the surefire x300 on. It was a really tight fit and the kimpro finish isnt as strong as other finishes.

I WILL LOWER THE PRICE TO $1000 without the wilson mag, cmc mag, vz grips, magwell. The gun will be basically all stock but will still come with the ed brown hardcore parts still installed and 100rds. If you want everything it will be $1200. The price is FIRM and I am taking no trades.

Anyways, if you are interested please text before you call REDACTED.
Please bring your CPL or ID. If you don't I will not sell the gun to you."

I have found it to be a pretty accurate gun for me but it can be hard on the hands shooting and of course you tend to want to blow through Ammo so it can end up being expensive to shoot.

When I first bought it new I did find it had problems with extraction with 147 grain 9mm but not 115 grain 9mm so I sent it back to Leinad under warranty and they replaced the extractor and put 2 full mags through it without issue and I have taken it to the range once since and ran a couple of mags without issue. So she is working well now.

Selling to pay for some car repairs so not interested in a trade at this time. Would prefer to meet in Raleigh and buyer must have a valid NC Pistol Permit or NC Concealed Carry Permit.

This is a Microtech Knives SCARAB Executive Single Edge Black TACTICAL (all black screws, button, and sterile blade) for sale. I do not have original box, sheath, instructions, etc.

                        Handle is completely smooth and flat aluminium.

This run was RARE. Sterile except for pocket clip which gives information about the knife. In GREAT shape- functioning properly- 10 out of 10 shape!
Originally purchased for $445.00 way back in '05. Never sharpened and blade has no scratches on it!

Buyer will pay shipping with insurance built in to cost. Will send USPS Priority and depending on location shipping should be anywhere between $9.00 to $15.00 extra incurred on the buyer.

Buyer will accept his/her states laws on automatic knives and possession of such. USA sales ONLY. NO APO addresses (cannot delivery conf. with APO's) 

Email me with any questions. 

I defy you to find this exact knife on the internet (youll find some with serrated edge, silver screws, blade markings- BUT not this- Unless you were a SEAL in that team). Store I purchased from stated the run was for a S.E.A.L. team with a quantity of less than 100 to be made. This knifes serial # is 00018. THAT SAYS IT ALL. Date of production 10/2005.

Take off pocket clip held on by carbide glassbreaker- it's STERILE. Nothing.

I have more pics, just email me and I'll send em.

MicroTech Scarab Details:

•Weight : 3.8 oz

The Scarab®, patterned after the original Ultratech knife, is built for action; a tough, tactical knife, the double action out-the-front, allows for easy one hand open/close. An ergonomic, contoured grip is designed for maximum stability, and also houses the glass break. The knife is fabricated to high quality standards to assure reliability."

The Body armor worn by our troops makes it difficult to properly shoulder a fixed stock (A2 style) weapon and quickly acquire the target, and the lighter buffers of the carbine proved too light to allow the proper kinetics for good weapons cycling.  The heavier, dead blow design of the H6 buffer solved the issue.  Also note that the 4 position collapsable stock is actually 1/4"" longer than the A2 stock when fully extended.  Which is good for you long armed skinny folks.  

Complete weapons system, all you need is the ammo.  Long list here, but better than no info at all :)  This rifle is built/designed to deliver a round out to 800m accurately and effectively.  I'm not including an optic with the kit, as an optic is a very personal item to a skilled shooter.  The BUIS is a good place to start.  I can swap the matech out for a G.I. A2 style carryhandle sight if you desire.  This is sold as a kit only.  I will not sell any item separate, though I do have some doubles of what is included, so you can ask about what you may be looking for.

The Rifle:  Configured in the M16A4 with 4 position stock, but of course is semi auto only.  
Spikes Tactical Lower Receiver with the bullet marks for safe/semi/full.  USMC Eagle Globe and Anchor emblem laser etched on the right side of the mag well.  FN made H6 Buffer (specificaly designed for the 20"" 1/7 twist rifle, so nothing is lost in the cycling of the weapon) FN tube, spring and stock, marked as such.  All mil spec parts in lower.  

The upper:  FNMI upper receiver, charging handle, barrel as well as the bolt and carrier. Barrel is of course 5.56mm, 20"" 1/7 twist, chrome lined bore and chamber, F marked front sight post (to match the flat top upper) A2 compensator.  Matech backup up rear iron sight, adjustable for both windage and elevation.  Knights Armament M5 Rail system with panels.  

Also included with the rifle are:

Custom cut Pelican 1700 weapons case

Grip Pod Systems foregrip that doubles as a bipod (excellent product)

6 Brand new G.I. 30 round mags with the beige ""No tilt"" follower

Insight Technology M3X LED Weapons light.  Model M3X-700-A15  rail grabber rifle light.  150 lumens.  extra batteries included with kit.

U.S.G.I. Weapons record log, helps keep track of round count, sight adjustments and other notes you want to keep about your weapon/shooting

M16A2 Operators manual (also covers the basics on this weapon) U.S.G.I.

One set of Bilsom ""Quietzone"" ear plugs.  The kind that are on a string and have soft cups for insertion to auditory canal.  reduce sound by 24db.   Bright orange so you don't loose them.

Otis cleaning kit in a zippered Molle II pouch.  This kit covers both 5.56 and 7.62 weapons, so you can use it on your other toys.   The pouch is labeled ""Sniper"" 7.62/5.56.  Very neat and compact kit with lots of goodies.  Even comes with an instructional DVD, which I find very funny.  

EVERYTHING listed with this kit is brand new.  I have laser boresighted the weapon, but have not fired it.  I may run a few mags through it over the weekend if I have time.  If I do, I will clean it properly and leave the sights set on their BZO.  And no, the price does not go down if I fire it.  Only iditots stress over ""Never fired"" weapons.  Get a life.  

No Trades, cash only.

Prefer to meet Face to Face in a public place or even at a gun store.  

I have a lot more pics on my phone, so call me and I'll text them to you.  I'm not around the computer much, so emailing is almost a waste of time.

843 224 919four  and ask for Todd.


This system is for a shooter that knows what he wants and what he/she is doing.  I will not answer retard questions or cater to picture collectors.  I hope you all understand where I'm coming from on this.  Hate to sound like a jerk, but tire kickers are a waste of my time.  

Ammo/Hunting comments:  This can be used to hunt Coyote or even deer.  I would use 62gr M855 or M855a1 ammo for coyote and 77gr Black hills or MK262 for deer.  Hornady makes a good hunting round as well, but I don't remember the weight.  Walmart 55gr ammo will work, but that crap is junk and I won't use it in my weapons.  If you must use 55gr, Use PMC.  Just note that you will have to zero the weapon to the round, so mixing ammo at the range or while hunting is going to give you drastically different results.  A 62gr round leaves the muzzle at 3,200fps.

I spent the better part of a year collecting the components to this system and spent over $2,800.00 doing so.  My price is firm, so if you think you are gonna meet up with me then whiddle me down, don't bother.  if you can't afford it or have to ask the wife's permission, don't bother me.
