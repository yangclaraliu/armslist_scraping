I also bought a stock, blued take-off barrel from someone that replaced theirs with a heavy match barrel. Target shows 10rds of CCI Mini Mag at 50yds with the blued barrel. I'm sure match grade ammo would do even better.

This gun has always been reliable and has fired any brand and type of ammo I've run through it.  Was my range gun and recently my EDC CCW but now I've upgraded to a 1911 and no longer need this neat little gun.

In very good to excellent condition.  There is some minor holster wear but not much.  The gun will come with two magazines and a Remora tuckable holster for CCW.

$400 is fair - sure you can order these guns for $400 online but then you have to factor in shipping, FFL fee and tax... also add the cost of a Bersa brand magazine (about $50) and the holster ($40) and the price is quite the deal.  Regardless feel free to make a reasonable offer.

Face to face deals only - no I will not travel.  I'll meet you in a mutually safe public place for the deal and I will only deal with people who have a valid government issued photo ID.  People with CCW permits will have preference.

I'm looking for the factory standard sights. I know many people remove these in order to install the night-sights, so I'm guessing there are probably plenty of these laying around in boxes somewhere.

I'm missing my rear iron-sight, so this is something I'm looking to buy soon.

E-mail or call me if you have a set of these you don't mind parting with, and what you are asking for them.

Thank you,

There is one individual on this site who keeps trying to sell me guns he does not have. He will tell you he is in a different state eveytime and he also claims he is in the military which makes it easy for him to ship a gun???  He refuses to give you a phone number and answers your email usually in the middle of the night. He will take pictures from other sites that have guns for sale and claim they are his. I am sure If you have inquired about a Remington 410 in the past couple months you have encountered this individual.

The Audi A4 is one of the better cars in a crowd of smaller sport-luxury sedans that, dollar-for-dollar, offers some of the best, most appealing vehicles in the world.

The A4 line is complex, with 21 variants. The key is thinking according to priorities: body style, engine size, front wheel drive, transmission type. All are nicely balanced, enjoyable automobiles.

The A4 2.0T turbocharged, 200-hp four-cylinder is one of the better small engines going, with satisfying response and spry acceleration, particularly with the standard six-speed automatic transmission. It corners like a sports sedan, and high-quality construction is evident inside and out.
Every A4 should appeal to techies. State-of-the-art engines feature direct fuel injection: the cleanest, most efficient means yet devised to blend gasoline and air in an engine's cylinders. The 6-speed automatic transmission delivers truly seamless shifting. Sophisticated suspension technology is augmented with electronic stability control, which can help the driver avoid a crash. The A4 is stuffed with safety features and offers rear side-impact airbags, while most cars in its class don't.

Unlike other tech-heavy cars, the gizmos blend nicely in the A4, enhancing comfort, convenience and safety, and improving the driving experience.

The Audi A4 is one of the better cars in a crowd of smaller sport-luxury sedans that, dollar-for-dollar, offers some of the best, most appealing vehicles in the world.

The A4 line is complex, with 21 variants. The key is thinking according to priorities: body style, engine size, front wheel drive, transmission type. All are nicely balanced, enjoyable automobiles.

The A4 2.0T turbocharged, 200-hp four-cylinder is one of the better small engines going, with satisfying response and spry acceleration, particularly with the standard six-speed automatic transmission. It corners like a sports sedan, and high-quality construction is evident inside and out.
Every A4 should appeal to techies. State-of-the-art engines feature direct fuel injection: the cleanest, most efficient means yet devised to blend gasoline and air in an engine's cylinders. The 6-speed automatic transmission delivers truly seamless shifting. Sophisticated suspension technology is augmented with electronic stability control, which can help the driver avoid a crash. The A4 is stuffed with safety features and offers rear side-impact airbags, while most cars in its class don't.

Unlike other tech-heavy cars, the gizmos blend nicely in the A4, enhancing comfort, convenience and safety, and improving the driving experience.

I bought this new in 1975 and it has maybe 500 rounds through it max as the light powder stains on front of cylinder denotes very little use.
Has rubber Hogue grips on it which make it real pleasure to shot compared to the stock small wood grips which come with it and I have to include as well as the original box & greese paper it came in.
Note; has some wear on cylinder from ratling around in a glove box - all cylinder would need is to be cleaned up with a 3m satin wheel as per factory and it would not be considered refurbished due to the minor clean up.
Therefore the asking price is set at $450 instead of $500+.
I am asking $450.00 or best ""REASONABLE"" offer - please - NO LOW BALLERS.....

The Audi A4 is one of the better cars in a crowd of smaller sport-luxury sedans that, dollar-for-dollar, offers some of the best, most appealing vehicles in the world.

The A4 line is complex, with 21 variants. The key is thinking according to priorities: body style, engine size, front wheel drive, transmission type. All are nicely balanced, enjoyable automobiles.

The A4 2.0T turbocharged, 200-hp four-cylinder is one of the better small engines going, with satisfying response and spry acceleration, particularly with the standard six-speed automatic transmission. It corners like a sports sedan, and high-quality construction is evident inside and out.
Every A4 should appeal to techies. State-of-the-art engines feature direct fuel injection: the cleanest, most efficient means yet devised to blend gasoline and air in an engine's cylinders. The 6-speed automatic transmission delivers truly seamless shifting. Sophisticated suspension technology is augmented with electronic stability control, which can help the driver avoid a crash. The A4 is stuffed with safety features and offers rear side-impact airbags, while most cars in its class don't.

Unlike other tech-heavy cars, the gizmos blend nicely in the A4, enhancing comfort, convenience and safety, and improving the driving experience.

The A4 can be pricey and it's relatively small. On the other hand, you'll have to look long and hard to find a car that blends driving satisfaction, safety, convenience, practicality, great finish and reasonable ownership cost as well as the A4.

Model: Model 95 - 1895

Serial Number: 417855 / B

Year of Manufacture: 1926

Caliber: .30-06 SPRG, Gov’t

Action Type: Lever Action Rifle – Internal Box Magazine

Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked “Nickel Steel Barrel / Especially For Smokeless Powder / .30 Gov’t’ 06”. There is a Winchester proof on top of the barrel and frame. The left side of the frame is marked “Manufactured By The Winchester Repeating Arms Company New Haven… / Patented Nov 5 95 Nov 12 95 Aug 17 97 Jan 25 98 Aug 23 98 …”. The lower tang is marked “417855 / B”. The upper tang is marked “Model 95 / Winchester / Trade Mark Reg U.S Pat Off & fgn”.

Barrel Length: 24”

Sights / Optics: The gun is mounted with a beaded blade front sight, on a ramp and in a dovetail slot. The rear barrel dovetail is filled with a blank. An interesting receiver mounted Lyman peep sight is installed on the left side of the frame. This is both windage and elevation adjustable.

Stock Configuration & Condition: The stocks are lightly refinished smooth wood, showing nice figure and very little wear. The wood is just a bit shallow of the metal. There are only light scattered marks and no splits or cracks. Overall, the grips rate in about Fine - Excellent condition, as properly refinished.

Type of Finish: Blue

Finish Originality: Professionally Refinished

Bore Condition: The bore is lightly gray and the rifling is strong and deep the entire length. There is very light frosting in the grooves, though this is more pore frosting than real erosion or pitting.

Overall Condition: This gun retains about 95% of its metal finish. The gun shows some finish loss from operation of the lever. There is only a mark or two on the barrel, apparently from storage. The frame and lever show very little wear, good edges and only a few marks under the blue; primarily on the lever. There is some nearly invisible erosion on the frame flats, under the blue. The Screw heads are reasonably good, though just a bit worn. The markings are still clear. Overall, this gun rates in about Very Good - Fine condition.

Mechanics: The action functions as designed though we have not test fired this rifle.

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: None

Our Assessment: The Model 1895 was the first Winchester rifle to feature a box magazine located underneath the action instead of the tubular magazine design, which had remained fundamentally unchanged from the Winchester 1866. This allowed the rifle to safely chamber military and hunting cartridges with spitzer (pointed) bullets. The M1895 was also the last of the lever action rifles to be designed by John Browning, and featured a rear locking bolt as in his previous designs dating back to the Winchester 1886. The M1895 is the strongest lever action rifle Winchester has produced, designed to handle the increased pressures generated by the more powerful smokeless powder cartridges entering common use at the time of its introduction. As a takedown rifle – the gun is even more functional AND collectible"

The Audi A4 is one of the better cars in a crowd of smaller sport-luxury sedans that, dollar-for-dollar, offers some of the best, most appealing vehicles in the world.

The A4 line is complex, with 21 variants. The key is thinking according to priorities: body style, engine size, front wheel drive, transmission type. All are nicely balanced, enjoyable automobiles.

The A4 2.0T turbocharged, 200-hp four-cylinder is one of the better small engines going, with satisfying response and spry acceleration, particularly with the standard six-speed automatic transmission. It corners like a sports sedan, and high-quality construction is evident inside and out.
Every A4 should appeal to techies. State-of-the-art engines feature direct fuel injection: the cleanest, most efficient means yet devised to blend gasoline and air in an engine's cylinders. The 6-speed automatic transmission delivers truly seamless shifting. Sophisticated suspension technology is augmented with electronic stability control, which can help the driver avoid a crash. The A4 is stuffed with safety features and offers rear side-impact airbags, while most cars in its class don't.

Unlike other tech-heavy cars, the gizmos blend nicely in the A4, enhancing comfort, convenience and safety, and improving the driving experience.

The A4 can be pricey and it's relatively small. On the other hand, you'll have to look long and hard to find a car that blends driving satisfaction, safety, convenience, practicality, great finish and reasonable ownership cost as well as the A4.

The Audi A4 is one of the better cars in a crowd of smaller sport-luxury sedans that, dollar-for-dollar, offers some of the best, most appealing vehicles in the world.

The A4 line is complex, with 21 variants. The key is thinking according to priorities: body style, engine size, front wheel drive, transmission type. All are nicely balanced, enjoyable automobiles.

The A4 2.0T turbocharged, 200-hp four-cylinder is one of the better small engines going, with satisfying response and spry acceleration, particularly with the standard six-speed automatic transmission. It corners like a sports sedan, and high-quality construction is evident inside and out.
Every A4 should appeal to techies. State-of-the-art engines feature direct fuel injection: the cleanest, most efficient means yet devised to blend gasoline and air in an engine's cylinders. The 6-speed automatic transmission delivers truly seamless shifting. Sophisticated suspension technology is augmented with electronic stability control, which can help the driver avoid a crash.

The A4 2.0T turbocharged, 200-hp four-cylinder is one of the better small engines going, with satisfying response and spry acceleration, particularly with the standard six-speed automatic transmission. It corners like a sports sedan, and high-quality construction is evident inside and out.
Every A4 should appeal to techies. State-of-the-art engines feature direct fuel injection: the cleanest, most efficient means yet devised to blend gasoline and air in an engine's cylinders. The 6-speed automatic transmission delivers truly seamless shifting. Sophisticated suspension technology is augmented with electronic stability control, which can help the driver avoid a crash. The A4 is stuffed with safety features and offers rear side-impact airbags, while most cars in its class don't.

Unlike other tech-heavy cars, the gizmos blend nicely in the A4, enhancing comfort, convenience and safety, and improving the driving experience.

The A4 can be pricey and it's relatively small. On the other hand, you'll have to look long and hard to find a car that blends driving satisfaction, safety, convenience, practicality, great finish and reasonable ownership cost as well as the A4.

The Audi A4 is one of the better cars in a crowd of smaller sport-luxury sedans that, dollar-for-dollar, offers some of the best, most appealing vehicles in the world.

The A4 line is complex, with 21 variants. The key is thinking according to priorities: body style, engine size, front wheel drive, transmission type. All are nicely balanced, enjoyable automobiles.

The A4 2.0T turbocharged, 200-hp four-cylinder is one of the better small engines going, with satisfying response and spry acceleration, particularly with the standard six-speed automatic transmission. It corners like a sports sedan, and high-quality construction is evident inside and out.
Every A4 should appeal to techies. State-of-the-art engines feature direct fuel injection: the cleanest, most efficient means yet devised to blend gasoline and air in an engine's cylinders. The 6-speed automatic transmission delivers truly seamless shifting. Sophisticated suspension technology is augmented with electronic stability control, which can help the driver avoid a crash. The A4 is stuffed with safety features and offers rear side-impact airbags, while most cars in its class don't.

Unlike other tech-heavy cars, the gizmos blend nicely in the A4, enhancing comfort, convenience and safety, and improving the driving experience.

The A4 can be pricey and it's relatively small. On the other hand, you'll have to look long and hard to find a car that blends driving satisfaction, safety, convenience, practicality, great finish and reasonable ownership cost as well as the A4.

Also included is a TNVC RSP Mod 1 in OD Green, also included is a OD Green sling for your M1A. The Global War on Terror has seen the reemergence of the M14 as a frontline battle rifle. It is seeing service in the hands of the squads’ Designated Marksmen and is proving quite effective at facilitating martyrdom with its potent 7.62mm NATO round. The M14/M1A is fielded by domestic law enforcement professionals, who protect our borders and keep us safe. And, in a less-glorified, but still all-American way, the M1A has been serving target shooters and hunters for decades. But, scoping an M14/M1A has been challenge facing every shooter who picks one up. No matter how you mount your scope, the standard M14/M1A stock sits too low for a proper cheek weld. Everything from taping foam padding to the butt stock to dropping the action into an expensive new stock system has been tried. We looked at the improvised comb height adapters on the market and thought: “There has to be a better way.” Enter the RSP (Riser Stock Pouch) Mod.1 designed to mount directly to a standard M14/M1A butt stock, the RSP Mod.1 raises the shooter’s cheek weld to the proper height for a scoped rifle (about 1.5”). The RSP Mod.1 is compatible with all M14/M1A scope mount systems including Sadlak, Smith, A.R.M.S., KAC, Springfield, etc. It is user-adjustable to fit stocks with trap doors or recoil pads. The RSP Mod.1 also features DMR-specific attributes such as a hidden range/DOPE card pocket that is quickly and easily referenced by the shooter. The Mod.1 differs from the Mod.0 in that a zippered utility pouch replaces the magazine pouch. This allows the Mod.1 to be better suited for other rifles with raised optic platforms such as bolt action rifles with raised rails. The utility pouch can hold various small mission essential items like batteries, strobes, cleaning supplies, etc. Please make sure this firearm can be owned in your state.make me a nice offer."

Crimson Trace Lasergrips in an exclusive rosewood finish with the classic 1911 double diamond pattern and the Kimber logo. As seen on Kimber Crimson Carry II pistols. Activated by a pressure pad just below the trigger guard, Crimson Trace Lasergrips project a bright red dot downrange, an important aid in training. Reading the dot immediately shows the advantage of proper grip and trigger control, which can dramatically improve accuracy and reduce time between shots for any level of shooter. Installation is simple and the laser is adjustable for windage and elevation."

We all know that Outfitter's place has ridiculous prices and poor customer service, Pawn Shops have poor selections and don't inspect any firearms before they sell them (which could blow up in your face, pun intended,) and the Lodge is a battle to get past the Paintballers just to see an overpriced poor selection. 

The New Gun Shop is located in Jacksonville, right next door to Fast Freddy's, has the best prices I've seen (even compared to online!) and has everything from .22 pistols to fully built AR-15's and everything in between. Tannerite targets and all the supplies you could ever need, including bulk ammo. They thoroughly inspect all used guns before selling them, and it's VERY clear that their #1 concern is a happy customer. Want a gun they don't have? They'll get it.

The Audi A4 is one of the better cars in a crowd of smaller sport-luxury sedans that, dollar-for-dollar, offers some of the best, most appealing vehicles in the world.

The A4 line is complex, with 21 variants. The key is thinking according to priorities: body style, engine size, front wheel drive, transmission type. All are nicely balanced, enjoyable automobiles.

The A4 2.0T turbocharged, 200-hp four-cylinder is one of the better small engines going, with satisfying response and spry acceleration, particularly with the standard six-speed automatic transmission. It corners like a sports sedan, and high-quality construction is evident inside and out.
Every A4 should appeal to techies. State-of-the-art engines feature direct fuel injection: the cleanest, most efficient means yet devised to blend gasoline and air in an engine's cylinders. The 6-speed automatic transmission delivers truly seamless shifting. Sophisticated suspension technology is augmented with electronic stability control, which can help the driver avoid a crash. The A4 is stuffed with safety features and offers rear side-impact airbags, while most cars in its class don't.

Unlike other tech-heavy cars, the gizmos blend nicely in the A4, enhancing comfort, convenience and safety, and improving the driving experience.

The A4 can be pricey and it's relatively small. On the other hand, you'll have to look long and hard to find a car that blends driving satisfaction, safety, convenience, practicality, great finish and reasonable ownership cost as well as the A4.
