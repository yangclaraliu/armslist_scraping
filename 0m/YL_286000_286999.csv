I got these guys in on trade and Im focusing more on geckos so theyre up for sale. I wasnt given a ton of info on them but I'll do my best to be as detailed as I can. The photos I have arent the best but if your seriously interested I can take as many as you'd like.

1.0 Ladder-tail Suri. About 5'. Feeding on f/t rats. Super clean and connecting saddles all the way down. Brick red ladder-tail. Decent temperament. $500

0.1 Ladder-tail Suri. A big girl at about 9'. Fat and happy with a great temperament. Feeding on f/t. Also super clean w/ connecting saddles and brick red ladder-tail. If you like super clean ladder-tails you wont find a better pairing than her and the male above. $800

Pair the above 2 together for $1200.

1.0 big male Suri. About 8'. If you like more of the classic look with peaks, etc then he's for you. Also a good temperament. Feeding on f/t. Nice red tail. $400

0.1 Huge girl - About 10'. A big heavy beast of a snake. Same as above with a more classic look but with less peaking. Feeding on F/t. A little hissy in the cage but shes fine once shes out. $700

Pair the above 2 together for $1k even.

Either of these pairs can breed this year. Get a 5 year jumpstart on your suri project. 

Also a 0.1 Suri. About 6'. Shes a bastard of a snake but she's really pretty and clean with connecting saddles, etc. Feeding on f/t. She'll make a great breeder in a year or 2. $250

Their caging is for sale also. All are 4'x2'x13""tall. All with sliding glass doors. All have locks w/ keys. One of them is divided into 2 2x2 enclosures. I believe they are wood but Im not 100% sure about that. Pretty well made. And stackable. 4 in total. Looking for $100 ea.

If you were interested in everything I can do a total package for $2000, thats all 5 snakes and all of the caging. 

I should add, all of these guys are OBO. Feel free to make an offer on any/all of them. Thanks

 552D1 HoloSight employs a true Heads-Up Display that eliminates blind spots,constricted vision,or the tunnel vision associated with tubed sights. All user controls are flush to the HoloSight's streamline housing with no protruding knobs,battery compartments or mounting rings blocking vision at the target area. Thirty brightness settings of EOTech 552D1 HoloSight ensure proper brightness control in either low light or very bright sunlight. An on-board microprocessor provides automatic battery check indicator,up or down brightness scrolling and programmable auto shutdown features. All optical surfaces of the EOTech 552D1 HoloSights are flat and treated with anti-reflective coatings eliminating additional muzzle side signature due to reflective glare,so there's no need for costly glare elimination filters ."

I just need cash and this stuff hasn't even seen a range so it just sits.

 This is Not a bargain priced factory lower. I selected the pieces part by part, took a few months to finish Even the strpped lower was custom, all milspec. all U.S.A. made parts down to the detents and springs. by far a superior lower than most Iv'e seen or held.

Basically this is less than my new lower cost after all is built and 12 free G.I. mags plus over 700 rds federal 62 and 64 grain higher end ammo. That's just the tip...

I am looking to trade my Pardner Pump Shotgun plus some cash for a decent 22 or 38 hand gun.  Looking to get one for my fiance for valentines day and I dont really need the Pardner Pump as I already have a few 870's.  The Pardner is a cheaper knockoff of the 870 and has only been used a couple times as a back up field shot gun.  I have probably put 20-30 rounds thru it and have only had it for about 6 months.  If you would be interested in taking this shotgun plus some cash for your pistol please let me know.  I am open to all types of pistols but am looking something in the 22 or 38 caliber (maybe 9m) and I also have a strong preference towards firearms made in the USA.  The Pardner is all black synthetic and would make an excellent home protection/back up field shotgun.  It has a 28 inch barrell and is a 12 gauge.  Thanks for looking.  Here is the link to Gander Mountain which has pictures and descriptions.

The Respironics BiPAP Auto M Series combines auto adjusting pressure delivery with the breath-by-breath pressure relief of Bi-Flex. Machine has Encore Pro SmartCard technology. Bi-Flex softens airflow at inhalation and exhalation, making breathing more natural and comfortable for patients. In Bi-Flex mode, patient-adjustable pressure relief is provided at the critical stages. BiPAP Auto M Series Bi-Flex Humidifer uses Bi-Flex pressure relief technology to provide CPAP humidifier therapy. This technology offers pressure relief at inhalation and exhalation to make BiPAP therapy more like natural breathing. By tracking each breath, Bi-Flex delivers pressure relief at three critical points in the breathing cycle: the transition from exhalation to inhalation, the transition from inhalation to exhalation and during exhalation.[br][br]

I do not have a communicable disease.
Machine did not work for MY sleep apnea (I was not a good candidate for it to begin with, but stupid insurance companies demand you fork out for one along with a sleep study before they do pillar or any other procedure) thus I gave it a shot for two 40min or so evenings and gave up.
It is in a full working order.
Why is it so cheap? Because I am just trying to cover my deductible.[br][br]"

Included with the pistol is a military-style holster complete with cleaning rod, an extra clip and a box of ammo to get you started.

The Makarov is a semi-automatic pistol designed in the 1950s as a simple and reliable  sidearm for the Soviet Forces, and has been the standard sidearm ever since.  The gun may be fired single or double-action.  Makarov 9x18 ammo is adequate for close-range protection, and the gun holds 8+1 rounds.  Ammo is cheap and plentiful.  

This all-steel pistol is small enough to be easily concealed, yet would be a perfect car or bedside gun.

666,http://www.armslist.com/posts/286666,For Sale:  German .22 snub revolver Fully polished!,"Highlands Ranch, Denver, Colorado",$ 130,"Listed On: Wednesday, January 25, 2012",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,Revolver,"First off I recieved this revolver in a trade and then stripped it all down . I then polished the exterior of the gun. The pics do not do justice.
This is a very unusual .22 short revolver that I believe was made in limited numbers in Germany to the importer EIG's specifications. I've never seen another like it. Description follows:

This is a lightweight snubnose revolver with a detachable hammer shroud (1 screw) which fully encloses the DAO hammer. Front of trigger guard was removed at the factory (not an aftermarket modification). Cylinder is not removable, utilizing a swing-out gate for loading and a detachable ramrod that screws into place under the barrel to push out individual brass cases. This is a 6-shot revolver stamped "".22 short"". Grips are very narrow checkered black plastic with EIG logo. Mainspring is a coil, as with a Charter Arms or Ruger, rather than the typical leaf spring found on RG/Rohm revolvers. For what it is, I was surprised at how much care went into the design and manufacture of this rare variant of a Saturday Night Special ""junk"" gun. I have fired 12 rounds through this piece and it is fully functional and surprisingly accurate.

It is very good condition as it has only sat in the safe other than some trips to the range.  I have right around 1200 rounds through it.  The only reason I am selling it is because I want something that I can carry too and this one is a little bit to big for EDC.  It has 3 dot adjustable sights rear adjust elevation and windage.  It comes with 3 backstraps, 3 mags, a speed loader, bore brush, and 2 Taurus keys.  I have also colored the lettering on both sides as can be seen in the pics.  I used Dupli-color automotive touch up paint.  So it will last and stay nice looking.  If thats not your style it can removed easily with nail polish remover.  Would prefer to do a FTF locally.  Buyer will also be responsible for transfer fee of $20 bucks at the FFL I go to.  I am lowering the price from 350 to 325 and I am very firm at 325 the gun is worth every penny of that!!!"

This piece is in perfect condition.  It was recently refinished and the action tuned by Wayne Markiewicz in Chouteau.  There is no holster wear, and the trigger is superb in both single and double-action shooting.

The revolver presently has the large Pachmayr Presentation rubber grips, but the original factory wooden grips are included.

The Combat Masterpiece was produced at the request of law enforcement officers who wanted the K-38 fitted with a 4"" barrel.  The model went into production in 1950 and was discontinued in 1987.  My gun was produced in 1970.

This is a perfect revolver for target shooting, hunting, or home defense.  Recoil with normal 38 Special loads is very mild.  This would be a perfect Valentine's gift for someone special.

Contact me to set up a face-to-face appointment. You won't be disappointed. Cash only, please."

The list is too big to put on armslist at one time. See the other list: Remington thru Winchester. We have the largest inventory of shotgun barrels you'll ever see at most gun shows! Most barrels are refurbished to like new condition. Some are brand new! *All Subject to prior sale. Your barrel will ship immediately if you pay by PayPal. Sorry, we don't do credit/debt cards.
We will TRADE for your old beat-up barrel in most any condition. Rusty, Nasty, Bent, Bulged or Dented.

We're not a regular business. We don't have a storefront. We're just two old guys that sell shotgun parts on the weekends at gun shows. We both hold regular full-time jobs too. To atempt to keep up with demand we also BUY shotgun parts, pieces, stocks & foreends. We'll buy junker pump &* auto shotguns just to get the parts. Why, we've bought four gunsmith's estates for its parts. 
BTW-we're in our 70s and don't do text.

The list is too big to put on armslist at one time. See the other list: Benelli thru Mossberg. We have the largest inventory of shotgun barrels you'll ever see at most gun shows! Most barrels are refurbished to like new condition. Some are brand new! *All Subject to prior sale. Your barrel will ship immediately if you pay by PayPal. Sorry, we don't do credit/debt cards.
We will TRADE for your old beat-up barrel in most any condition. Rusty, Nasty, Bent, Bulged or Dented.

We're not a regular business. We don't have a storefront. We're just two old guys that sell shotgun parts on the weekends at gun shows. We both hold regular full-time jobs too. To atempt to keep up with demand we also BUY shotgun parts, pieces, stocks & foreends. We'll buy junker pump & auto shotguns just to get the parts. Why, we've bought four gunsmith's estates for its parts. 

M-F call Roy @ REDACTED (warehouse)
Nights/weekends, Jim @ REDACTED
We are old guys, we don't text.

See our huge display of Shotgun Barrels at mid-south gun shows! 
We will be back on the road in September.

Griffon's were imported from Sough Africa and use all standard 1911 parts. I replaced the crappy plastic grips that came on them with Colt wooden grips. It has a round count of approx 50, has never been carried, and has been a safe queen for years. It comes with 2 mags and a hard case. It has night sights (dead) that are encircled with a white edge so they are still very usable. It's a great weapon but I have become a Glockman and don't have much use for it anymore.
