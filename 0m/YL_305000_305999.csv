Yeah, you heard right.)

I have put a crazy amount of time and money into this gun. It wanted the ultimate zombie weapon, and lo and behold, this is it. It is accurate, reliable, and in great condition. 

I bought a new Saiga 12 in early Fall of 2011. It's only a few months old. I have since upgraded it with several accessories and modifications:
- Tromix trigger group
- Hogue Monogrip
- Quad rail system
- Six-position AR-style stock with shock absorber
- MD Arms improved gas plug
- Trigger restored to the proper position as God intended
- 20 round drum magazine

The trigger modifications and ergonomic grip make this weapon a real AK again. Fire from the shoulder or hip with ease and control. Access the safety without having to use your off hand or take your trigger hand off the, well, trigger. The quad rail allows tons of options for adding lights, lasers, scopes, vertical grips, bipods, you name it. The quad rail still allows access to the iron sights, and they are quite accurate. In addition to the 5-round factory magazine (great for hunting), you get a 20-round drum (great for zombie hordes) with a translucent back that lets you know exactly how many rounds you have left. This is a weapon for a survivor who leaves nothing to chance! The old gas plug only had two settings, and you had to use a tool to adjust it; the new one has five settings (optimized for varying pressures, so you can fire both 00 magnum and reduced-recoil rounds with ease) and can be adjusted by hand. The stock is adjustable for users of any shape and size, and contains a show absorption system so that you don't get fatigued emptying all 20 rounds.   

The amount of firepower contained in this weapon is staggering. You could run into several moose who combined to form Moosetron, and this gun would see you through. 20 rounds of 00 buck fly out the barrel as fast as you can pull the trigger, with the ergo grip, gas plug, and buffered stock giving you tight control. If creating a metal storm is your goal, look no further. 

The trigger and grip modifications were performed by a top-notch professional gunsmith.

This gun is in great condition. It has been cleaned after every use, and exhibits zero issues.   

Including all the original factory parts as well: stock, foregrip, gas plug, 5rd magazine, field cleaning kit, etc. 
Also included is the spare shorter top rail for the quad-rail system. 
Also throwing in a padded soft case!

Asking $1300 or best offer. 
I am selling this grade A lead dispenser in part so that I can get an automatic for concealed carry. I will consider a CZ75B, Springfield Armory 1911, or other high-quality automatic in trade."

A lot of work and top of the line parts have went into this awesome shotgun.  It will shoot anything you feed it.  The gas system was modified by boring and polishing the gas ports in the barrel to 3/32” each and enlarging the port in the gas block so that all gas ports are completely unrestricted.  That, in combination with the upgraded performance spring and puc, this gun will fire any cartridge, including the low brass Walmart “100 round value pack” Remington and Federal birdshot to full power buckshot and slugs.  The bolt hold open lever was also modified to easily allow the safety to be installed or removed without taking the entire fire control group apart.

Brand new; never used outside of my house.

I purchased the EL SWAROVISION 10x42 from a local Swarovski store in September 2011.
I used them once and realized that as nice as they were I would likely not use them much more in the future.
I attempted to sell the bino in December 2011 and then learned that despite paying for an EL I actually received an SLC.
Fortunately, the Swarovski store manager exchanged my bino for what I paid for - the EL SWAROVISION 10x42 with no questions asked!
I'm glad that got straightened out, but I still doubt much usage.  So it's back on sale.

It comes with factory iron sights and a Leupold 2 x 7 ""rimfire"" scope with duplex crosshairs. Scope and mounts are brand new (I originally had another scope on it).

Also comes with 2 spare 5-shot clips (total of 3 5-shot clips) and a clip that only allows for single shots).  Has Uncle Mike's sling swivels.

This rifle was originally a Youth model and came with the smaller size berch stock (included) and the 16.5-inch long barrel.  I changed the stock to an Adult size factory laminate one.

It is a very compact rifle with the 16.5-inch barrel and very accurate (the target shown is 5-shots at 50-yards with the factory heavy pull trigger). I have read that the trigger is fully adjustable and can be adjusted down to a 2-3/4 pound let off with a very smooth pull. I never did it, but the info is on the web.

My longest shot was 98-yards at a gopher (Columbian ground squirrel) - which isn't all that big of a varmit.

It's been shot about 200 times. Finish is still in very good condition (very deep blue finish), bore is perfect.

NOTE to buyers: Please provide a phone number and email address along with inquiries/offers, so I may contact you if need be. I tried to reply to an offer from Winston Salem, but your email account blocked my reply.

fs/ft:
Springfield, full-size lightweight model Lew Horton Ltd. edition Night .45. (one of only 300 full-size made by the Springfield Custom Shop for Lew Horton in 1996/7).

Aside from dim night sights (which should be grandfathered in to the lifetime warranty on this model) this gun is in fantastic shape for its age, with only minor holster wear from open carry. 

Videki Speed Trigger, Hogue wraparounds (original to this gun and NOT the newer model), Lightweight hammer, and alloy frame which is a joy to carry compared to std. weight 1911. 

Will include original magazine and an extra, as well as a well-used holster.

Shoots 1.5"" groups (easily more accurate than I am...lol) at 25 yds. I was going to send her off to have Sprigfield replace night sights, but I recently found this EXCACT model in the compact version (4"" vs 5"" barrel). 

I cannot afford to keep both, or I would! 

Make a decent offer in the $750 range, and this beauty is yours. I prefer FTF sales, but will ship from my FFL to any FFL in the CONUS for $750, and I will eat shipping.

Extras don't cost people $0. This rifle has alot of extra stuff that cost REAL money. I am not by any means asking more than all of it is worth. No one could build this rifle with these extras for 800. This is just an opportunity for someone to own a bad ass tactical .22 for a HELL of alot less than it would cost to do it themselves. 400 off of the original cost is more than fair depreciation for the condition it is in.

Custom Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22 for sale or trade + cash.

This is a very nice .22 AR, and impresses everyone who sees it and handles it.

It is in EXCELLENT condition, and has had several HUNDRED rounds put through it, as most all .22's do. If guns were made to wear out after 5000+ rounds they would be worthless. So this has more than enough life in it to justify the cost.

It comes with:

1. NC Star 2.5x10x50 Red/Green Illuminated Reticle scope with quick detach mount and flip up covers. - $100.00
2. Rock River AR Carry Handle with removable weaver rail. - $50.00

9. US Army Foliage Green Duracoat finish on upper and lower. $150.00
10. Hogue AR grip. - $30.00
11. Mako Fab T-Pod foregrip with spring loaded bipod legs. - $100.00
12. NC Star Flashlight/Laser combo with cord and pressure switch. - $65.00
13. YHM Phantom Flash Hider with threads for suppressor- $65.00 SUPPRESSOR NOT INCLUDED.
14. CAA Magwell Grip. - $30.00

All of the accessories cost $775 not including shipping and gunsmith labor.

$800.00 is very fair for what would cost you over $1200 to do on your own.

Also comes with 3 25rd mags, 1 10rd mag, Manual, and padded tactical rifle case.

If you want a basic M&P 15-22 for 450-500, then go buy one. If you want a decked out M&P 15-22 that already has tactical upgrades, so you dont have to mess with it, then this is the rifle for you.

This rifle is very accurate, the scope is zeroed in, (it can be removed and replaced and still maintain zero), and does not have failures to feed, fire or eject.
99% of the time that is caused by the large amount of powder residue left from .22 ammo.
You must clean the chamber and the bolt face very thoroughly, in order for the rifle to function properly. This may require cleaning during shooting after a few hundred rounds. Failure to fires are generally caused by residue build-up on the bolt face where the rim of the round seats in the bolt, which keeps the round from seating completely in the bolt, causing the firing pin to not be able to fully strike the rim of the round. 22's are bad for this, as it is a dirty round.

I might be negotiable on the 800 price, depending on what you have to trade or the amount you offer..

i bought this for my son who didnt like it.  i didnt know that mossberg made the same gun in a tatical version with the same name and looks just like an ar-15.

at the time i bought the gun i got a model that had two mossberg  factory stocks.  both are synthetic one being black and the other being ""dura wood""  which looks like a tiger maple print.  i then ordered another magazine from mossberg.  this gun shoots from external 10 rd magazines and other sizes by other manu's can be bought as well.  so there are also 2 ten rd magazines in total.  the silicone gun sock comes with the gun and i am also adding a bushnell 3-9x32  rimfire scope complete with rings, and covers (rings mounted at factory) that is new in its factory package.  originally we had a small rimfire scope on the gun that became damaged while using it on a different gun and this scope was to replace that one.  how ever my son does not like this gun because it is not tatical enough so it just sits in the safe unused.  

this gunn has had a total of 150 rounds shot through it in total.  no more and no less.  it is virtually brand new and it is clean.  

with all of that being said, i know i am not going to get $300 oout of it so i am really looking to trade.  i am pretty openminded about what i trade for, but am not really interested in pistols or revolvers unless it is something special.  also i am not thinking that i am going to get some great gun like an ak or ar out of this either.  if someone wants to trade me one of those for it, we'll cross that road if we ever get there.  i was thinking of a tatical .22 of any kind, a .22 magnum or a .17 hmr.  i am not looking to make a mint just to make an honest and fair trade.

let me know if you are interested in trading or $225 takes it all. thank you

It was manufactured between 1934 and 1940 by Marlin for Sears Roebuck.
It is also known as a Marlin Model 65.

It is a single shot bolt action, meaning you have to manually load each round into it. There is no magazine, or tube.

It shoots .22 Short, Long, or Long Rifle.

It is in excellent condition for being 75+ yrs old, no rust, no scratches on the walnut stock. The bluing is great. It is very accurate, and has adjustable rear, and front blade sights.

Before I bought it a few years ago, it had sling swivels and a flash hider installed, and stock looks to have been refinished. I bought it from my best friend, and it was his fathers childhood rifle.

My son learned to shoot with it, and now I don't need it anymore.

It is a very nice, very old .22, and you just dont find them like this anymore.

Has  period Leupold 3x9 VERI-X II scope, scope has a slight reddish tone to it, optics are perfect. This looks to have been one of the salt wood stock rifles that had been returned to Browning for repair. There is some pitting below the wood line that barely shows with the stock in place. I called Browning and talked to one of the repair techs and was told if it had not been fixed it would be completely rusted away by now, his feeling is that it was re-stocked by Browning and any corrosion was halted. The recoil bolt and sling swivel studs show no damage, if this was a salt-wood stock they would have been eaten away.  The trigger guard and floor-plate may have been replaced as there is no engraving on it, and there is no rust or pitting on it.  I took pictures of the damage as can be seen. It is a good looking rifle as is ( with the stock on ) and should be a great rifle for a long time to come and in a great caliber! I am pricing it well below what non-salt rifles go for because of the damage.  $975 shipped to a FFL OBO

On the right side there is a slight water stain, this could be extracted or touched up with a professional restoration, however it is not in the main body of the artwork. At the bottom left is G. Morland and T. Rowlandson's credentials and on the lower right is S. Alken's credentials with the date of 1790.

This is a period piece that does not come up for sale often, it is an original and not any type of reproduction. I have no knowledge of art and only inherited this piece and only passing on the research that I have obtained. Please research online or at a local art museum for details. I am told in an auction setting this piece should sell between 1700 - 2500 USD. 
I would like to trade this piece for a shotgun or rifle as I am not a big art fan, I am sure there are some art enthusiest out there that would love to have it.

Very sturdy mount. Blue loctite and all. 

4x32 Simmons handgun scope with weaver rings & mount, handles the recoil nicely and has perfect eye relief. Regular rifle scopes will not work with this rifle because of the eye relief being to short on the rifle scopes.

Sighted in at 150 yards with decent groups. Kicks like a mule (on angel dust) so I added a limbsaver slip-on recoil pad. 

Only had this gun to the range once, maybe 100 rounds thru it? Comes with the oil can, bayonet, tool kit, sling , etc..... as well as the remainder of the ammo from the 440 round tuna can of surplus ammo. 

So, i've got $350 into it, out of pocket.......not counting several hours of time invested........What have you to trade ? I am looking for a nice stainless revolver, derringer , a nice .380 semi auto? Double barrel shotgun ? other gun trades?

Browning A500, not 500 blah whatever, old school A500. Belgian made. 2 3/4 and 3"" chamber.

full rib barrel with a fiber optic front bead (original gold ball is still there too - fiber sight can be removed without mod to the gun). removable chokes - using Invectors. also has a selector switch so you can empty the semi auto chamber without dumping your magazine tube of shells (NEAT!). roll scrolled designs in the reciever, left side has the John Mosis Browning portrait in the scroll work which i always thought was pretty bad ass.

the wood on this gun is beautiful, the barrel is in good shape, more safe marks than woods marks. to be upfront, the receiver is rashed. if it wasn't this would be too pretty of a gun to hunt with. so it goes. there is no rust present. the pics are fairly representative.

since this ain't pristine, i'm asking $300. only trade option right now would be a lower end AR upper, no bull barrels. i'm not desperate so save the low balls. FTF local metro area."

I'm looking for a .22, or .38/.357 revolver, no cowboy-style single actions though, or possibly a semi-auto in 9mm or .45.  Would also be interesting in a decent extended-capacity shotgun, pump or semi-auto. Any trades will be considered however. If the trade's good I've got a Russian 1895 revolver I'd be willing to add, or possibly cash.

I have been reading alot about the 16 gauge ever since I decided to sell this beautiful piece of history it was know as a gun that feels like a 20 gauge but 
shots birds like a 12 gauge and I am seeing more and more 16 gauge shells 
on the shelves now too. I saw this same gun in a 20 gauage sell for 895 on 
Gunsamerica. After doing some more research I found out that this gun was made In the 20's and 30's. Again beautiful shape no rust barrels are great. 
Even the Wood looks great. I would also consider trading for nice handgun large caliber or a nice dear hunting gun. Lever action 30-30, I just lowered the price to 325.00 this is any easy 500 dollar gun in the condition its in. Now its a steal."
