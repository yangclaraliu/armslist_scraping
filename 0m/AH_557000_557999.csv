In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

great gun, very little wear, ready to go!!!

The Glock 22 RTF (Rough Texture Frame) offers shooters a platform based on the ever so popular Glock 22 frame. However, Glock has stepped it up to the next level with this one. They have implemented several nice touches which are more than beneficial for the average shooter or collector.

The main upgrades of this combat pistol include a texturized combat grip which provides a more comfortable and secure grip throughout any shooting situations. In addition, they have also implemented front strap serrations on the weapon slide which is ideal checking and clearing weapons, but all provides great style to the firearm.

Glock pistols are the perfect combination of reliability and accuracy. Their high-tech engineering and construction create a handgun that can stand up to more punishment than even the most unforgiving conditions can generate. When you investigate the individual advantages of a Glock, you'll see that it will outperform whatever you're shooting now. Glock pistols are some of the most widely used the world over for law enforcement and civilian use both, for it's reliability, high capacity, and light weight. Glocks are safe, simple, and intuitive, designed for carry, range use, or duty.

tactical 3.5 lb trigger and bar,

2 factory Glock 10 Rnd Mag with custom Mag sleeve, 
and Glock embroidered 2 Gun range bag. 

Most receipts and all factory parts included. Tactical sand grip tape. Some minimal holster wear.

Ported barrel extends 1” past end of slide and will not accept reloaded ammunition due to the expansion of the brass case once it has been fired, and the tighter tolerances of the CNC machined barrel. Factory Glock barrel will accept anything. Purchased in November 2008 and has about 200 Rnds thru the weapon.

This Glock 27 has lightening fast cycling and extremely quick lock up with minimized trigger travel for unbelievably fast controlled double taps.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Dan Wesson combined the best features from two of their most popular models, the Bobtail Commander and the CCO. The new Guardian has the bobtail frame to help reduce printing when carrying concealed, and the alloy frame, makes it light enough for comfortable full time carry. The commander length slide and alloy frame give it just the right feel and balance. The Guardian wears the handsome and durable black “Duty” finish from Dan Wesson. If you are looking for a lightweight, commander-sized 1911 in .45 ACP, don't pass up the Guardian.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"
164,http://www.armslist.com/posts/557164,For Sale:  M92 Yugo AK Krink (sidefolder) 1.6 mm Receiver w/ fake can,"Madison, Jackson, Mississippi","$ 1,495","Listed On: Tuesday, September 11, 2012",Rifles,Zastava                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"If you want a really cool/unique Krink, this is perfect for you.  You can get the punch of the 7.62x39 cartridge but have the comfort and better cheek weld that a sidefolding stock offers.  The sidefolder is what drew me to this build originally, but I have too may other irons in the fire so this one needs to go.  As much as I've tried to like the Yugo underfolder stocks, they were just never comfortable.  I thought I was going to loose a tooth every time I've shot one. I have personally build some Khyber pass style rifles and always preferred the sidefolder stock.

Test fired only,Yugo M92,762X39, Sidefolder,semi auto rifle, krink.Built from virgin kit,on Arsenal Global Trades rec. 1.6mm,922r ready.Fake can.
Beautiful gun, fit and finish 125%.  I've owned/built a bunch of AK's and you won't find a better quality build or finish than this rifle.
This is an older virgin kit and not one of those that came in about a year or so ago.  This build was done at least 4 years ago.
The can is blind pinned to ATF specs, small weld on pin, and ground down. No welds on sides of can. Easy removal and you probably resell can if you go the SBR route.
I'm the second owner, not counting the builder.  I've never fired it and neither did the original owner.
Here are the notes from the original builder that were passed along to me when I bought it.
The side folder is Russian, or Bulgy. It has the rolled edges.
""I was heavily into building about 5-6 yrs ago.  When the kits started coming in with cut barrels is when I sold all my ak tools. When I was building I also sold and bought lots of ak stuff.  Back then my username was AK carpenter, I was on gunco and AK.net as well as the AK files. My build tools were, the ""plinker jig"" for setting rivets,worked Perfect, I also had my own lathe so I could make special tools for pressing etc, I also bought a new set of cylinder headspace gauges because I built several virgin kits, not demilled kits. I built about 40 ak's and all but the last five were built on the heavy 1.6mm global trades receivers for some rock solid builds.  Then Global went out of business. I would sand blast, parkerize, and use duracoat matte black for all my builds.
Now details .This was a virgin kit, it was never assembled, original none chrome lined barrel, I don't have the underfolder stock, I sold it to help support the hobby.  The fake can I bought from Arrty and is very nice. It runs perfect. I put about 50 rds through it.  At the time I was more into building ,not shooting. Everything about this build is as good as it gets, perfect rivets, proper headspace, and a good duracoat job.  I used a badger 350 airbrush, The only thing I noticed the other day when I was cleaning it is the serial numbers on the right side of the receiver are a little light, but you can see them in good lighting.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability. Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense. 

FEATURES:

Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.

Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.

External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.

Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.

Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.

Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.

Barrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

This is a rare gun. Chambered in .308 Winchester/7.62mm caliber. I’m told H&K only imported about 48,000 of these from ’74 to ’89. This is NOT an aftermarket 91 or a CETME. Most of the parts are not original to the receiver, but most are still H&K made parts I believe (with a few exceptions). The gun shoots beautifully. It will feed anything you want to put through it. As you can tell, this gun is certainly not in “like new” condition. Instead, it has obviously been used in the past. The pictures should tell you fairly well what kind of shape this gun is in. This gun comes with both the wood furniture and the plastic furniture, for whatever mood you are in. As you can tell, it has a “wide” OD Green hand guard with bipod. Also, it comes with four (4) magazines and a Tapco scope mount.  Know your local laws before you commit. I can E-mail you more pictures if you are interested. These can fetch around $2000 in this condition. Get this rifle while you still can! $1799 or best offer. Don't low-ball me, because I like this gun."

The GLOCK 19 is ideal for versatile use through reduced dimensions compared with the standard pistol size. With the proven caliber of 9x19, it has found worldwide distribution in security services. In addition to being used as a conventional service weapon, it is suitable for concealed carry or as a backup weapon. For instance, many of the elite pilots of the USAF for instance trust the GLOCK 19 for their efficient defense in emergency situations. 

Externally, what is immediately apparent is the multiple backstrap design of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to small, medium and large frame hands. The surface of the frame is the Generation 4 Rough Textured Frame. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed shooters. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

It uses a 12”, lightweight, sculpted rail derived from the REPR platform. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with in the NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well-balanced rifle.

The SPR features LWRC's enhanced fire control group. Those models coat the bolt and the bolt carrier in proprietary nickel finish, which promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry. Its piston is of a mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

An upgraded Geissele Trigger is already installed. The Geissele Automatics National Match will lighten the trigger pull relative to a standard trigger. This lightened trigger pull will make the weapon easier to discharge.

The Action-4 can be used with any type of firearm including handguns, whose shooters have won many accolades and competitions. With its 4 different reticles, users can be more versatile with the ability to adjust to different conditions and ranges without a second thought and on the move as proven in the 2009 Bianchi Cup. Rugged and versatile, the Action-4 comes with a set of sunshade extension, protective lens covers, and 33mm aluminum rings. Its stainless steel threaded drop drum turrets are strong and will never move from zero making it the best red-dot option on the market."

$450.00 with everything pictured, if you do not need the iron sights will knock $20.00 off

Bore is mirror sharp and basically perfect except for what looks like some debris or very, very minor pitting 1/4 the way up the pipe, looks more like debris tho cuz it starts going away when I scrub it with a nylon bore brush. The safety has also been modified to accommodate a scope (see pics). Very accurate rifle and has cleaning rod and hood. Comes with Truglo 1.5 6x32 scope/mount/sling.

2.) The other one is an M48A, no modifications/all original, all matching, UNFIRED, awesome bluing just like the other one, comes with sling as well. Has cleaning rod and hood. Also some nice tiger striping on the butt.

No other auto-loaders have even come close. Here are a few reasons why:

Stock and Forearm: The fluted stock design incorporates a full pistol grip with an undercut and silver spacer, and is ready-contoured for use with open sights or a scope (not included). The forearm is full and hand-filling.

Finish: Gloss finish; Grade II/III Walnut; Rosewood forend.

Safety: Cross-bolt design with enlarged head.

Trigger: Short, smooth, single-stage pull. The trigger assembly can be easily removed for maintenance and cleaning. Enlarged trigger guard.

Magazine: Detachable box magazine with a unique hinged floor-plate.

Action: The BAR is a gas-operated auto-loader with an extra strong, multiple-lug rotating bolt that locks directly into the barrel. Every cartridge that is loaded into the chamber of the BAR is surrounded by a recessed bolt face, which is encircled by the barrel and then surrounded by the receiver. Three complete rings of steel surround the cartridge. A seven-lug bolt and precise breech-to-chamber relationship give the BAR exceptional accuracy and the strength to handle magnum loads. The strong and very rigid action bar/inertia block link-up improves accuracy by reducing barrel vibration. The buffering system reduces wear and stress on the rifle's mechanism.

Barrel: Individually machined from hammer-forged, heat-treated billets of steel. Gloss nickel finish.

Safety Lock: A padlock is included for safe storage.

Comfort: Recoil pad; Sling swivel studs installed

Nearly new (taken to the range twice) XDm 9mm for sale with all XD gear accessories.  I bought this recently but unfortunately need to sell it now.  It's a great gun, XDm is by far my favorite handgun I have personally shot.

I had the TFO sites installed right after I bought it, most of you know the cost to get night sites installed is over $100.00.

If you have any questions on this one let me know.  I can drive within about a 10 mile radius of Woodstock to meet up.  If you'd like to shoot it I can meet you at the range if you cover range time and ammo.

I did colorfill on this, I know it's not everyone's thing but I like the look of it.

Sorry, not trades at this time.

I won't require a BoS but will require ID showing you are a GA resident.  However if you would like a BoS I have no issue with providing one.  I also have a few more pics available if anyone would like to see them.

This is a collectors grade rifle. No re-arsenal markings or signs of refurbishment anywhere on this rifle. It has all matching numbers on the bolt, carrier, stock, receiver, receiver cover, magazine, trigger guard, rear sight, and gas tube. It has the original blade bayonet, original cleaning rod, original cleaning kit, 10 stripper clips, 200 rounds of Russian match grade 7.62x39 ammo, and case. The bore is bright and shiny with strong rifling. The bluing is original and none of the pats have been painted over later. The stock is its original dark hardwood finish and has the original serial number without being forced matched and having a bunch of XXXXX's over the old serial number. The stock has no cracks or deep gouges, just minor handling wear. The receiver cover is marked with the Tula star inside the star logo and has the date stamp of 1952r under the logo. I bought this gun over a year and a half ago and it has sat in the safe ever since. I have never fired it, and never planned to in order to keep it in the collectors condition it is currently in. I know what this gun is worth as would any serious SKS collector so please don't try to low ball me and compare this with the Yugo's and Norinco's out there. Take a look at gunbroker for similar condition rifles and you will see that there are few out there and are worth every bit of my asking price. 

Bottom dollar price is $550 FIRM.  I am located in Dublin and if you want to buy this, you must be willing to meet me in this area. My job doesn't typically allow me time to travel beyond the Dublin area. If interested, email me. Thanks for looking."

All internals are new S&W parts. This revolver has been Dark Earth DuraCoated, has a custom grip extention installed on the wood grips and trigger job done 2 weeks ago. Very smooth action and a reliable conceal carry piece. You will never find another revolver exactly like this.

 I value this revolver at $300 +, considering the custom work done to it and the age of the piece. 

This revolver was modeled after the S&W model 23 using S&W machinery under contract by S&W. This was before the BrazTech and InterArms days. This is a design of Amadeo Rossi and imported by Garcia Importing, well before Taurus become involved with operations. This revolver was manufactured between 1975-1982. The actual date is unknow due to poor record keeping.

This revolver is a piece of living history that operates as smooth and reliable any any revolver you can purchase today.

It uses a 12”, lightweight, sculpted rail derived from the REPR platform. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with in the NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well-balanced rifle.

The SPR features LWRC's enhanced fire control group. Those models coat the bolt and the bolt carrier in proprietary nickel finish, which promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry. Its piston is of a mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

An upgraded Geissele Trigger is already installed. The Geissele Automatics National Match will lighten the trigger pull relative to a standard trigger. This lightened trigger pull will make the weapon easier to discharge.

Also installed are all features required for California compliancy, including a bullet button.

I just acquired it in a trade a few months ago. Took it to the range and it is by far the smoothest shooting most accurate 357 I own, I just don't have a good use for a 6"" gun this nice. 

Make me an offer.  I definitely prefer cash, but I'll consider trades for other handguns (plus or minus cash as appropriate). Feel free to offer me anything, worst I can say is no, and here are some (only a few) examples of what I would consider: almost anything in 10mm or 41 magnum, decent quality 1911s, sp101 in 327, S&W 629-3 or -4, but that doesn't mean I might not be persuaded by what you have to offer.

It features a heavy 6"" barrel with a full-length lug underneath.  It's in perfect condition, and has been shot very little over the years.  It comes with an attractive plush-lined zipper carrying case.

When you pick up this Ruger GP100, you KNOW you’re holding a weapon.  It's stout, heavy and easy to aim. The white-outline rear sight is good and finds the target easily. It is also adjustable for windage.  The trigger is quite good, breaks cleanly, and is not difficult to manage in double-action shooting.

This is a heavy gun, and the upside is that a heavy gun has less recoil. Shooting .38 Specials out of this gun is like shooting a .22, you barely feel it. 

The GP100 is an excellent outdoors sidearm.  It will easily take rabbits and other small animals, and will clobber deer, javelina, badger, bobcats, coyotes, and offer protection from cougars and bears in a pinch. The versatility of the .357 Magnum is unmatched, especially when one factors in the ability to fire .38 Special ammunition. As a defense handgun, the .357 reigns supreme, having the best stopping record of any cartridge.  For home protection, the .38 Plus-P loads are more than adequate. The GP-100 is certainly chambered for the optimum cartridge, as revolvers go.

The GP100 has no manual safety on it, but it does have a transfer bar safety system which prevents the hammer from hitting the firing pin without the trigger first being pulled all the way to the rear. This means you can drop it without it going off.

Bill Ruger set out to design a new gun around the very hot ammunition it would have to use. His goal was to design the most durable Double-Action .357 Magnum ever. The result was the GP-100, introduced in 1986.   Apart from the fact that it has a full-lug barrel, the thing that sets the GP-100 apart from the crowd is that the front cylinder lock is on the frame and the crane.  It's no wonder that the GP-100 has become a true modern classic of its type.  The GP100 meets, if not exceeds, everything you would expect from Ruger. 

I am asking only $500 cash for my GP100, and it's worth every penny.   Contact me to arrange for a meeting so you can inspect this fine revolver.  I promise you won't be disappointed."

Nice stainless gun so it won't rust on you.  It's been sitting loaded by my bedside for the past several months, hard to beat 7 rounds of 357.  Nice smooth double action trigger, clean crisp single action.  Might make a very nice carry gun if you want to use it for that, the cylinder really isn't much bigger around than most 6 shot 357s.  

I got it in a trade, and now it's time for me to sell it, I've just got too much stuff in my house and I've gotta get rid of some of it.

I'm looking to get cash out of it, the price may have some wiggle room in it, but not a whole lot.  It's a great shooting gun, and if I had any time to get out to the range I would probably keep it, but I'm a little too busy.  Trades I'd consider (plus or minus cash as appropriate):  Glock 20 Gen 4, Smith 629, Colt Delta elite (well, just about anything in 10mm I guess), stainless colt 1911, a 357 lever gun, 41 magnum revolvers.  If you've got something you think might interest me, go ahead and drop me a line, the worst that can happen is I pass on the deal, but I am really looking for cash.

Thanks for looking."
