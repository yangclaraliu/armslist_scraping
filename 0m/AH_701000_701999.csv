L.E. 20-21 fits G20, G20SF, G21, G21SF

From the Advantage Arms website:

1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK OEM sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot."

Also an improved synthetic stock and butt pad. I have about 5 rounds through this rifle. Just enough to zero the scope. The only reason I am selling it is that I have a prosthetic bone in my shoulder and the punishment from the recoil is more than I want to subject myself to. The rifle shoots great and has a very crisp and light trigger. No creep, just solid and smooth. The rifle will come with Leupold scope bases and 50rds of Hornady 180gr SST match grade ammo in a plastic storage container. The ammo is factory not reloaded. It is just consolidated into the box. The shown scope and 30mm rings are NOT included. I have already sold them separately. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me. given the new condition and minimal use I am asking $725 firm for the rifle, bases, and ammo.

This pistol has been well cared for it's hole life and is still almost like new.  It is a very early Series 80 that was made in around 1983 or 1984.  The only trade I am interested in is a quality 1911 or a .22 Mag semi-auto Pistol.  Would add some cash for the right Colt 1911 or Revolver  I will expect cash in addition if you are offering a .22 mag semi-auto pistol.  I have a fair collection of .22's so I'm only looking for the one .22.  Email me with your contact info and I'll get back to you.  Low-ball offers and rude people will be ignored.  I am asking top $$$ for a top $$$ pistol but will listen to reasonable cash offers."

This shotgun is in very good to excellent shape, no scratches or dings anywhere, bore is squeaky clean and the whole gun is like new. I got the gun on a trade last month and I have not even fired it. My buddy bought it new about two years ago, I know it was fired about a dozen times then cleaned and stuck in his cabinet to collect dust. This gun is built like a battleship and can take a lot of punishment and keep shooting. The problem is that I have injured my shoulder and it is too hard for me to rack this monster, and I know my wife wouldn't be able to use it either. Not good for home defense. I can include the owner's book, the cable lock, a box of bird shot and a couple boxes of 00 buck. I am willing to deal with this gun, and I will accept all respectful, serious offers. Thank you"

Black rifles are flying off gunshop shelves these days. Not having to buy one from a dealer has an added bonus: no paperwork. While this is what I consider a ""Second Amendment"" private sale, I'm not going to sell to anyone I don't feel 100% comfortable with. No bozos; I'll find you out.  I have decided to divest myself of this for a personal reason, not because I have to. This isn't a fire sale.  If you are contemplating any offer under $1000, keep moving... there's nothing to see here.

I haven't posted any pics because you know what these rifles look like.  I can send pics to serious buyers, but they will look like a factory rifle with a couple accessories and a scope you can find onine.  I am expecting reasonable, serious offers for a seriously near-new rifle. No surprises here. Besides, if you see it and it's a POS you don't have to buy it, do you? ;-) (Trust me: I'm not wasting your time or mine.)

For people that want to trade I will give and take MSRP value plain and simple. I will explain it all since you don't get it and its great your brother has an FFL, I don't scam people check my ads. Gun I paid $1200 for plus tax is $1320, ammo with tax is $598, I buy the ammo at diamond back police supply, mags $122, cerpa holsters $80 equals $2120 not including the drop leg and six mag holsters. So who am I scamming? 

I also got bored and pulled all the five seven ads off armslist and I am definitely at a reasonable price. If not don't be afraid to call and explain why I'm not. I guarantee if you go to the gun store and buy just the FN five seven you will walk out spending at the least $1300.00. If you can find one, they aren't the easiest to find, not rare but not on every shelf.

I love the gun but it sits in the safe, and I have other projects that need to be funded. Here's the specs: 

Winchester 52D, serial # is 115XXXD which I think comes in as a born on date of 1964. There are no US Gov't markings. 27” stainless steel Krieger barrel was put on new, and has exactly 41 rounds through it. The stock is in incredible shape, and has been glass bedded, also comes with Winchester 52 handstop. The trigger is light and crisp, safety removed. To the best of my knowledge the action has not been refinished, so you can see this is a very low round count gun. The bolt knob has some unusual speckling to it, looks kinda antiquey cool. Scope mount and proper height Burris Zee rings included in the deal. This gun is ready for a scope or iron sights. The scope in the pic has been sold. Weight without scope is 13 lbs.

I'm only selling this to get an AK in either 7.62, .223, or .308

The Kel-Tec SU-16 is a hybrid between an AR and an AK. The rifle combines the proven bolt system and accuracy of the AR with the ultra reliable Gas piston system of the AK-47 or AKM. The whole rifle is polymer like a Glock except for bolt carrier group, bore, barrel and chamber which are all chrome lined. This rifle is new, comes with manual, box, cable lock etc. 

The barrel comes threaded with a thread protector to quickly attach any muzzle brake, flash suppressor or sound suppressor. 

This rifle takes AR magazines, the front fore grip unfolds to make a bipod and the rear stock under-folds and will fire in the closed position making it very very unique and versatile. The best thing about this rifle is that it is super lightweight, magazines are widely available, cheap, and it is as reliable as an AK-47.

The price is firm and it's what I paid for it so no profiteering here. I should ask for more considering the times and how extremely hard these are to find. The first person to call me and pay cash takes it.

I have received a lot of questions about the make, construction, etc... and have posted info below:

The ARCUS-94 is a single action semi-automatic pistol. It integrates the proven reliability of the High Power pistols with the ergonomic design of modern pistol tendencies. The single action mechanism combined with the capacity of 13 rounds make the pistol both accurate and efficient for self-defence, training and competition shooting.

The Arcus 94 KA Mk III, a deluxe version of the Arcus 94, was produced in Bulgaria for the Israeli's in the early 2000’s. It is an stronger built clone of the FN Browning Hi-Power (it is heavier, made to be more robust with a thicker, and heavier slide). 

Most parts are interchangeable between the Arcus 94 KA-MK III and the original FN BHP with the exception of the slide and the frame. Magazines, springs, grips, hammers, and most other essential parts are interchangeable. BHP 13 and 17 round mags are interchangeable with the Arcus.

Unlike the first generation Beretta 92/96/M9 series, the Px4's trigger guard is rounded for better concealed carry. The takedown pin of earlier models is replaced by a spring-loaded bar, accessed via frame recesses at both ends, which must be grasped and pulled down simultaneously to release the slide. The slide spring is doubly captive, being inserted approximately an inch into the transfer block at one end and a receiving hole in the front of the slide at the other. It is a self-contained assembly, completely captured by the polymer guide. The magazine holds the top round directly behind the barrel's breech end so only a slight feed ramp is needed. This allows the barrel to fully support the case. The 6-R rifling of the barrel generates counter-clockwise torque which is harnessed by the locking system to reduce the amount of pressure required from the rotating barrel lock's cam and pin system to affect unlocking. The steel transfer block's cam pin is 5mm wide and 2mm deep. The entire hammer unit mechanism can be removed from the Px4, without the use of special tools, as a single group. This allows easy access to the firing mechanism for cleaning. The Px4's design makes it impossible to assemble incorrectly from a field-stripped takedown.

Px4 features an interchangeable, luminescent 3-dot sight system (coated in Super-LumiNova) for use in dark or low-light situations. With short exposure to any kind of light, the night sights' luminescence lasts up to 30 minutes. The weapon also incorporates a Picatinny rail under the muzzle to allow flashlights, laser sights and other accessories to be attached."

 Can add cash for the right deal. 
 Might also be willing to trade much of it for a beater SKS or something else that shoots 7.62x39 and then keep some of it. Project guns considered.

 Ammo is mainly 80's milsurp, packed loose in .50 cal ammo cans. Brass cased, so most have tarnish/dull spots from that waxed paper they packed them in (but no corrosion or damage). Never failed to feed or fire in my SKS, not even once. Packaging claims its non-corrosive (it always does, doesn't it?), and it actually seems to be, but old milsurp powders never seem to shoot quite as clean as new manufacture either.
 Also have 500+ rounds or so of boxed bulk new manufacture (Tula and Wolf) to throw in there as well.

The gun has pachmayr grips on it and comes with the hard shell box, two mags( one with pinky rest and one without), factory manual and dated target from the factory.   This is a beautiful gun and compared to the prices on guns america it is a good deal.
