This is Brand New in Box from the factory. Part # REPRR7B16, 16"" Barrel LWRC REPR .308 PISTON DRIVEN AR. The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 12” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

Whoever keeps flagging as a scam, keep flagging. I'll just keep posting the ad since it's legit. 

This pistol is from one of the first production runs out of FN after Liege was liberated from the Germans, assembled from parts produced under German occupation but with all Liege/Allied markings (no German stamping of any sort). Based on the serial number, it was probably produced in late '44 or early '45. Smooth top slide, no rib, GI sights. Serial number is A60xx -- rare four digit with A series prefix.

I'm in no hurry to sell this as I don't really need the money or the Glock, this is just for my fun.

Includes one serial number matching 13rd FN (extremely rare type magazine with split tongue baseplate), two 13rd FN OEM mags, and two 15rd MecGar mags, Spegel style grips and original WWII grips, Israeli 1911 holster modified to fit the Hi Power, and a Hunter leather holster."

One is a 700 Tactical, 20” 1:9 twist barrel. Purchased new 2/2/12. Broke in properly, shot 10 shots cleaning after every shot, 30 shots cleaning after every 3 shots, 45 shots cleaning after every 5 shots (total round count is exactly 85 rounds). The last 5 shot, 100 yard group measured .499” and was shot with 69 grain Sierra MatchKings seated 2.30”over 26.0 grains of Varget in Federal Gold Medal brass with Federal Gold Medal primers. It has Leupold Mark 4 2 piece bases and Maxima quick release scope rings in medium height. All finishes are matte black. I have original box and paperwork. No defects and as new. The other is a Remington Model 700 .223 BDL Custom Deluxe, 24” 1:12 twist barrel, with a Leupold VX-IIc 3-9x40mm scope with Butler Creek flip open lens covers in Leupold low rings on Leupold 2 piece bases. The rear site has been turned around to accommodate the scope. The gun is in good condition with a few handling marks. There are a few smudges in the clear coat on the stock and there are a few imperfections in the blueing on the barrel. No pits or rust on any of the metal though. The scope glass is perfect but there are some scratches on the scope body. The bore is in excellent shape and the muzzle crown is perfect. The trigger has been adjusted and is very light and crisp. I loaded some 52 gr. Sierra MatchKings seated 2.2” over 26.5 gr. of Hodgdon 4895 in Federal Gold Medal Brass with Federal Gold Medal primers. I shot a five shot group from a cold clean bore. I had the usual cold, unfouled bore shot that was 1/2"" from the rest of the group. The other 4 shots were easily covered by a quarter. The next 5 shot group was the same except the cold bore shot was not as far from the rest of the group. I was shooting prone with a bipod and monopod at 100 yards with both rifles. The aluminum case is a T.Z. Case International and is lockable. Complete package for $1,300 or $650 apiece plus shipping. More picture upon request.  Contact REDACTED if interested. Thanks."

Whoever keeps flagging as a scam, keep flagging. I'll just keep posting the ad since it's legit. 

This pistol is from one of the first production runs out of FN after Liege was liberated from the Germans, assembled from parts produced under German occupation but with all Liege/Allied markings (no German stamping of any sort). Based on the serial number, it was probably produced in late '44 or early '45. Smooth top slide, no rib, GI sights. Serial number is A60xx -- rare four digit with A series prefix.

I'm in no hurry to sell this as I don't really need the money or the Glock, this is just for my fun.

Includes one serial number matching 13rd FN (extremely rare type magazine with split tongue baseplate), two 13rd FN OEM mags, and two 15rd MecGar mags, Spegel style grips and original WWII grips, Israeli 1911 holster modified to fit the Hi Power, and a Hunter leather holster."

There is no more durable, reliable pump shotgun than a Model 1300 Black Shadow. The non-glare matte finish of the barrel and receiver won’t give away your position to wary waterfowl and the durable composite stock and forearm are up to any abuse a day afield can dish out. The hard working Speed Pump action fires all factory steel, tungsten, bismuth and lead shot compatible 2¾"" and 3"" magnum loads."

TRP hand-forged National Match frame and slide

Iindividually cut the rails, drill the pinholes, and fit the slide by hand lapping it to the frame. The result of this attention is a slide to frame fit that has zero vertical or horizontal play. The TRP has a match-grade Springfield barrel that is fitted to a match-grade bushing making the pistol more than capable of providing superb accuracy and reliability. The match grade trigger is aluminum and fitted with an overtravel stop. The trigger pull on my sample broke cleanly at 4.5 pounds with no overtravel. As with the Professional, the TRP features a magazine well extension, checkered front strap, beavertail grip safety, and ambidextrous extended safety. The grips are unique to the TRP line. They are made from a G10 composite with a snakeskin like texture and feature a relief cut on the left panel to improve access to the magazine release.

MUST SELL***
The Tactical 2 is the most advanced version of the precision rifle developed by Blaser. Each design element was driven by the requirement to create the best shooting platform possible. Exceptional accuracy was one of the key principles during development, with effective engagement ranges of 1500 meters or more, depending on caliber and ammunition. Advanced engineering and uncompromising quality are evident in every facet of design. The Tactical 2 is a bolt action rifle featuring Blaser’s revolutionary straight-pull action. When the bolt is closed, the 360 degree radial collet expands into the locking groove in the barrel – the bolt head is auto-centering and self-headspacing. The straight pull action features no rotating parts and assures rapid reloading with minimum movement. The rifle can easily be converted for left or right hand shooters. Interchange calibers by replacing the barrel and bolt head, in under a minute, without special tools and no change in accuracy. Barrels are cold hammer forged, fluted and plasma-nitrided to provide maximum resistance against corrosion and abrasion. An M1913 Picatinny rail is fixed to the barrel, ensuring full compatibility with a wide range of optical sighting systems. The muzzle end is threaded for an optional muzzle brake. The receiver is machined from aircraft grade billet aluminum alloy and is the interface for the barrel, bolt assembly, trigger assembly and magazine. A recoil lug of hardened steel is integrated into the receiver. The entire unit is fixed to the stock, eliminating temperature induced distortion. The outer surface is hard anodized. The ergonomically correct stock is injection molded out of fiber reinforced polymers and is absolutely stable, even under extreme temperatures."

REDACTED
A shotgun makes such a thoroughly awesome home defense weapon. I learned the full truth of that statement during my first defensive shotgun course. My love and respect for my Remington 870 and Mossberg 590 pump guns grew, but there were a couple of students using way cool tactical auto-loaders . . . Although I tried not to let it show, I suffered from a bad case of scattergun envy.  For years afterward I looked for a suitable semi-auto defensive shotgun. I just couldn’t bring myself to spend roughly twice to three times what I’d paid for a good pump action shotgun. Turns out I just was waiting for Mossberg to release the 930 SPX (for Special Purpose) Tactical shotgun . . .


The Mossberg 930 SPX Tactical has an aluminum receiver, a tactically sound 18.5” steel barrel, an extended magazine tube and a tough but lightweight synthetic stock. The gas-operated, semi-automatic shotgun is a direct descendant of the excellent Mossberg 930 hunting guns. The shared self-regulating gas operating system reduces recoil and eases stress on its components by venting whatever excess gas isn’t required to cycle the action.

The system uses two gas ports in the barrel to power a piston that surrounds the magazine tube under the barrel. The set-up gives the Mossberg a bit of a chunky for-end (to accommodate the moving parts), but nothing that looks out of place. The 930 SPX functions smoothly and reliably without a gas seal ring. An added bonus: the 930 SPX also field strips without a lot of drama."

The gun is a blast to shoot! It's heavy enough that you don't hardly feel the 7.62x39 rounds when shooting! Truly a fun gun. Ammo is SUPER cheap to shoot (around $4-5 a box of 20 or so) and the gun prefers the cheaper ammo. I have used this gun at both the range and hunting and it performs well in both situations. I am unsure off of the top of my head what optics are on the gun, but it is included as well.

I have some Bulgarian 7.62 x 25 surplus for sale. The rounds are wrapped in packages of 16, so the price is $5 per 16- or $15 per 48. Yes this is more than you're probably used to paying, but now-a-days it is very difficult to find 7.62x25mm AT ALL! let alone cheap surplus. Also if you can find new factory loads you're going to have to wait two to three weeks before it ships to your house. As such, the price is firm.

**Edit** In reply to someone who brought up the CheaperThanDirt Sellier & Bellot price of $0.36/rd *or* $18.01/50rds, they forgot about shipping which is $13.17. In other words- $0.62/rd *OR* $31.18 for one box of 50!
    Not only that, but you'll still have to wait AT LEAST 2 weeks to get your purchase.

I have all the original paperwork for the gun as well as the original case and accessories it came with. The gun comes with the 2 magazines that came with the gun when purchased and a Beretta magazine that was $50. I also have a brand new $60 Bianchi holster that I am including in this price. (If not interested in the holster, I will sell the gun without the holster for $600). I am selling the gun as I need money for financial reasons. Otherwise I would not part with a Beretta 96 INOX that will soon become a collecter's item. This is a CASH deal. No trades. The Buyer will be responsible for all FFL fees.

The SF in the name means Short Frame excellent for smaller hands as the trigger reach is reduced from the standard Glock 20.

A Benefit of the Glock 20SF is though its made to fire 10mm ammo you can buy aftermarket barrels to fire the .40 SW, .357 Sig, and 9×25mm Dillon. So if your looking to buy a Glock 22 that fires .40 SW you can get a Glock 20 that gives you the option to fire 4 Calibers with a simple barrel swap.

10mm with a 6"" Barrel also makes a great Hunting Cartridge.

I have an excellent condition Smith&Wesson Airweight model 442 chambered in .38+P, this is a five shot revolver that is super light weight. The gun weighs only 15 oz unloaded. This gun is in excellent condition, with just a few rub marks around the trigger guard. Everything functions perfectly, and the action is smooth as glass!


I don't have the box and manual right now, but I will have them in approx 2 weeks! Right now I have just the gun, but I am also including in the deal 70 rounds of 135 gr Winchester White Box ammo, and also a ful box of Magtech Golden Guardian 125gr +P hollopoints! I am looking to trade this gun for a subcompact or compact auto. If someone gets this package I will send the case and paperwork to you when it comes in to me. Or I will gladly come to you to deliver after it arrives as long as your local.

This probably rates as one of the weirdest weapons ever produced. Few other weapons can incorporate such a huge magazine capacity into such a compact design. The weapon is interesting for many reasons which will be discussed later.  The M-950 is a pistol! Yes it is a very large pistol with a high capacity magazine, but it is very definitely classed as a pistol. 

Specific features of the Calico according to the manufacturer are:

50 or 100 round magazines 

Superior handling due to the fact that the backstrap of the pistol is much higher than other guns, directly behind the bolt rather than under it - almost eliminating muzzle climb

Ejection of spent cases downwards making it a truly ambidextrous weapon"

Now I'm looking for a 12 gauge shot gun for turkey hunting.

The go kart is an 1980's to 1990's single seater.  It came with a 5hp Briggs & Stratton.  I rebuilt the 5hp but the carb still had issues.  It ran with fuel dumped into the top but not through the gas tank.  I ended up buying a brand new Predator 212cc (6 1/2hp) from Harbor Freight.  I also bought the 2 year extended warranty.

I sand blasted the frame, wheels, seat pan, and other metal parts.  The seat pan, wheels, and other metal parts were painted silver.  The body was painted blue.  

The wheels have new bearings.  The motor, clutch, sprocket, brakes, throttle cable, kill switch, and seat cover are brand new.  

This go kart is fast and a lot of fun to ride.

Update:  Have had several emails asking if I'd sell it.  I will for $350.  I also forgot to mention the original 5hp B&S comes with it."

The barrel is a B.sid 1954 with correct bolt  very desirable and highly accurate the TE is 3.5 ME is 3.0  it has the a P.B trigger group and a straight cut SA op rod with a Danish stock with serial numbers

I tested it at the range and it fires flawlessly and if i would let my 13 year old shoot it you can trust me it's solid.. The wife would hang if anything happen to her youngest.. 

Okay the why I am selling it for him. The receiver is a Century Arms. That makes it built here in the USA with parts imported from Canada. In other words it cannot be used in an as issued match at camp perry or elsewhere  that a CMP saction match is shot.. ...   it such a shame, it is very accurate.. 

The price is firm I am loosing money on it at 600.00.. this could be parted out for more than 600 easy this is just a shot in the dark so to speak..

The reason for the one day sale is we are going to the CMP store at Camp Perry this Saturday.. I told him I would  try and if he did sell it he could get a field grade for the 600.00 

I will add I am heading north to Perry very early Saturday 7 am to 9 am travel time ... if someone up north want it and would like to meet us on the way  in one of the towns let me know..

Also I can put you in touch with a guy locally that has Crown over FKF receivers for roughly 300.00 installed. then you would be only 1 piece away from a true Danish rifle..  and that would be the op rod and Im sure there is someone out there that will trade you a Beretta or P.B one for the SA..  

The price is FIRM.. CASH only... 
NOTE: the Sling is not included (sorry)

833,http://www.armslist.com/posts/366833,For Sale:  Jennings Strike Compound Bow,"Colorado, Colorado, United States",$ 375,"Listed On: Thursday, April 12, 2012",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Strike is a NEW combination of short, straight compression-molded carbon fiber limbs (Exclusive Jennings CK™ technology) with the enhanced Jennings jREV™ Cam.

Jennings Archery says: ""Strike represents a flat-out performance breakthrough at a flat-out amazing value,"" and I will have to agree with their statement. (Visit Jennings Archery web site: Jennings Archery)

As with any box arriving at my home in the mail, I tore into it with vigor and excitement. The Strike comes professionally packaged and quite secure in the Jennings box. My initial inspection of the bow started with an overall look at everything. 

The New Mossy Oak Break-up coats it from head to tow giving the bow a deep rich camouflage pattern. Looking closer at the entire bow revealed flawless dipped coating from the top to the bottom. Impressive so far.

What really stood out to me was the size of this bow. Axle to axle this bow is only a mere 31.5 inches and light as a feather in my hands. Only 4.2 pounds to be exact. I've never shot a bow this short and had no idea what I was in for. I did know however that at this length, it would be an ultimate tree stand bow. 

I next measured the brace height and it came out at a very respectable 7.625"". Over 7 and a half inches in brace height makes for one very smooth and forgiving bow. I knew then and there that Jennings had produced a winner.


Proven Components: The Strike has a feather-light riser machined from aircraft aluminum, double taper lock limb cups, and TechTwist strings - all proven Jennings components that deliver long run, top-of-tune performance. Comes equipped with vibration dampening from Sims Vibration Laboratory.

Strike delivers a deeper valley, smoother backwall and enhanced let-off-yet achieves speeds of 305 fps.

I mounted a Stealth Hunter arrow rest, the Hindsight Extreme with a Copper John's pin sight, a string loop, tossed it into the Bowkaddy mounted in my truck bed and I was off to the range to see what this baby could do! 

My first draw with the new Strike was like running into a complete stranger that you feel you've known for years. Set at 70 pounds, the draw was smooth and comfortable and when it hit it's nearly 80% let-off, I was in heaven. I can't tell you how many times I've been at full draw waiting for that deer to clear the tree before my shoulder gives out. Hoping that all the shaking isn't going to knock every leaf off of my tree before I pass out. Jennings says 78% let-off, but to me, it felt like 90%. Literally, you can hold at full draw for quite a while comfortably. Vibration and hand shock were almost non existent. Truly a joy to shoot and get to know.

As for arrow speed, they tout a whopping 305 fps. I could only get an arrow clocked at around 302, but that's close enough for me. Any bow that's 31.5"" axle to axle and shooting an arrow over 300 fps is just fine in my book. I wish they wouldn't have gone to a thin grip as I feel it lessens consistency when shooting, but it is none the less very comfortable in my hand.

It took me no time what-so-ever to get this bow tuned in and shooting deadly accurate. The bow shoots so fast that the Sims string silencers lasted a grand total of 10 shots before both had flown off the string and bounced somewhere down the range. That's when I noticed that the bow string hadn't been twisted more than 3 times. I used a press and put a total of 7 twists in the string. The Sims string silencers are now reinserted and working just fine.

The most amazing thing about this bow is it's price. Carbon fiber limbs, j-REV balanced single cam producing arrow speeds over 300 fps, an aircraft aluminum machined riser cammo dipped for durability, and all in a package weighing in at 4.2 pounds and 31.5 inches axle to axle all for a suggested retail price of $399.00. You are truly getting a top of the line bow for literally half the price of other brands. Believe me when I say, ""You can't go wrong buying this bow."" As a matter of fact, I decided to make this my hunting bow this year.

I highly recommend this bow to anyone.

REVOLVER - modern style (not cowboy style) SA/DA, .22 LR, preferably a 4"" barrel but not a big deal. Thinking in the under $200 range.


RIFLE- Bolt action .22 LR, preferably not single shot, but it doesn't matter too much. Would like something with iron sights that I can put a see-thu scope mount on later. I used to see these for sale all the time when I wasn't looking for one, but now they have all disappeared. Thinking in the roughly $100 range.

A few years old, not very many rounds put through it. A few scratches on the stock. Some wear marks on the steel from cycling.
Other than that, the steel receiver and bolt look beautiful.

Included:

Mini 14 with all stainless barrel and action. 
Wood stock.
“See through” scope rings.    With a 3-9 power Mil-Dot scope.  So you can use either  the iron sights or scope, at the same time.
3- steel 30 round mags,   These function flawlessly.
1-plastic 30 round Promag, I think.  This functions good with most ammo.
1-steel 10 round mag      Factory flawless.
1-rifle length hard Aluminum case.

All for $500             Will Do $450 for all minus the case.

Will require a bill of sale stating that you are not a felon.  ID required.

This is a great point and shoot gun.  Light and short, but powerful enough for off hand varmint jobs.
Great slung over your back while on horseback, or on an ATV.  A great throw around rifle.
Mini 14s are not known for super accuracy, but they are dependable, and easy to take care of and clean.
With cheap ammo this can usually shoot about 5 or 6 inch groups at  100 yards."
