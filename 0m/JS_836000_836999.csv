Comes with the following upgrades:
1. After mark stock added during the Ban Years.  So it does not collapse but a high quality light weight black plastic stock.
2. 30 round (detachable) clip is brand new
3. After market Scope Mount added
4. Flash Suppressor / compensator added
5. Original sling
6. Original bayonet

The bayonet does not click into open position due to the after market Flash Suppressor.  If you remove the flash suppressor it works as intended.

This SKS has not been fired in probably 10 years.  It's sat around in the basement and has a light amount of surface corrosion. I cleaned it up and everything still works great.  It was only lightly shot back 15 - 20 years ago otherwise has sat around for all of its life.  For this reason I'm selling at a really good price and this is cash and carry.  

Drivers license which I will copy is required.  You know the rules, no felons or similar issues need not reply.

Would do a partial trade for a Ruger Mark III or II with threaded barrel.  New or used doesn't matter but would need some cash unless it's the right deal."

As with most of the Romanian WASRs, they are plagued with the canted FSB and RGB; this rifle has a slight cant to the right. Rifle was sighted to compensate. 

This rifle comes with two sets of wood furniture: laminated wood and Romanian SAR-1 hardwood with palm swell. 
Barrel is Chrome lined, threaded and equipped with a slant brake. 
Two different slings: Romanian leather and Chinese Green canvas with leather. 
Three pistol grips: Two Romanian Bakelite with inward diamond checkering and one black U.S. made. 
No cleaning rod.
Two 30 round steel magazines: One Romanian with Finnish floor plate and one Chinese. 
Fire trigger assembly has been substituted for a Tapco G2 single hook assembly.
Safety on the rifle was disabled before ownership and does not affect operation.
Rifle could use new bluing.
Lastly, this rifle has received one of the nicer ""single-to-double"" stack mag-well conversions that I've seen.  Nothing about the work was jagged and I've had minimum wobble. ***It varies between the magazines used***. 
Front trunnion, gas tube, bolt assembly and dust cover are all number matching; spring is stamped, but with another number. 

Rifle has been disassembled, cleaned, sprayed with Corrosion X, re-oiled with M-Pro-7 and the bore has been wiped with M-Pro-7 Copper Remover. 

I rather sell the rifle than trade, but I'll entertain all offers. If value is slightly greater, +cash on my end.
I am particularly interested in the following:
Kimber .22 rifles; H&K .45 USP; full size 1911s; .40 compacts."

This rifle was built using a near new AKM kit and a Krinks receiver by our company, Ironwood Mfg. We are a class 2 firearms mfg. & have been in business in Tucson for 14 years.
This rifle is unique in that it has all the original Romanian trigger parts, which we believe are far superior to some of the US made parts most imported AK come with. The trigger has been re worked to produce a short, smooth stroke with a light 4# pull. The bore is excellent, bright & shinny.    
The durable finish is Brownells baked on Teflon/Molly coat.
The gun has been test fired only and functioned flawlessly. It has a threaded Tapco muzzle brake & US made soft pistol grip. The wood is very good with no noticeable dings & no cracks. 
Because it does not have US made internal parts the gun does require a magazine with at least 1 US made part, (floor plate, spring, or follower.). It comes with 2- 922r compliant mags and a universal follower,($3 fromTapco), you can put in your fav. magazine to comply."

Something many don't know, John M. Browning used an 1873 to make his first prototype automatic firing gun. After seeing what a muzzle blast could do to a patch of grass, he tested it and found he was correct. The muzzle blast from the gun was heavy enough to be harnessed, so he took a flapper and attached it to the muzzle and the lever and invented his first automatic rifle."

Since then I've put less than 150 rounds through it.  I don't use it or have a need for it so that is my reason for selling it right now.  It is in good shape and was a fun gun to shoot.

It is the G Model of the Beretta 96.  The G Model was designed for the French Military (insert joke here).  It features a manual decocking lever only, when the decocking lever is used the gun returns to a double-action state.  There is no other manual safety.

The gun came from Gander Mountain with a 10 round clip; I purchased two extra 12 round clips that I am including along with half a box of ammo, a hard case, and bore snake for cleaning."

The sear pin is broken so it can only be manually advanced and the hammer does not lock back. Really interesting pistol. Manufactured during the 1920's to 1930's. The wood grips are good. When I removed the wood grips I found a name engraved inside with the date 1946. Buy this to restore, use as parts, or keep as a display piece. I have never fired this gun and would suggest it be checked by a gunsmith before considered fully safe.

I bought all of these parts brand new and had this rifle built with all the parts that matter. I put this rifle through a 60 round break in procedure the first time i had it out. It was primarily used as a hunting rifle and for some occasional target shooting. This rifle was thoroughly cleaned after each outing as every rifle should be, and has under 300 rounds through it total on the high side. I wrapped it in camo form self cling camouflage wrap (not sticky) to keep it scratch free and also to camouflage it for hunting. This is such an easy rifle to shoot accurately and  basically has no recoil at all. Very well taken care of one of a kind rifle. Buyer must sign a bill of sale, and the price is $3,000 cash only. Price reflects current market value and the parts used. Serious inquiries only please. Call me at an appropriate time please at (716) 725-two one six two"

This is the “original” Operator, designed to meet the specifications/requirements of the FBI Hostage Rescue Teams. This pistol won the FBI contract. Springfield fulfilled the FBI contract and then changed the design for the civilian market thereafter. This is one of the few Operators that was produced to the FBI’s specs but shipped to the civilian market!

This Operator has a bushingless bull-barrel design. That puts more of the weight to the front end and significantly reduces felt recoil. This is also one of the few Operators that has the original FBI full-length dust cover and picattinny rail. It has an ambidextrous thumb safety, a mag funnel for rapid reloading. This gun is all orignal as it came from the factory. This is truly a one hole shooter, this gun is very reliable and has a very low round count, I would estimate 400-500 rounds that have been shot through this gun.

Contact Walmart's Corporate offices and tell them you don't do business with organizations that support gun control.

I would use the first link ""Store and Corporate Feedback"" or just call the number. It doesn't take many negative calls to scare retailers like this out of these positions. They know for every person who calls there are hundreds more who don't bother to call and just won't shop there.

MATECH BUIS Leaf Sight is current issue to US Military. This Windage and elevation adjustable flip-up rear iron sight is battle tested with a low-profile design. Folds down out of the way when not in use. Will fit under a Trijicon ACOG riflescope.

Elevation adjustable to 600 meters.

Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight for M4 carbines and M16A4 rifles flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights.
