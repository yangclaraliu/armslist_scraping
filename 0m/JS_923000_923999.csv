 The AK has been completely cerakoted in graphic black and the wood furniture has been refinished in Russian Red. It will come with 2 sets of furniture, one set is original the other set is Bulgarian with a pistol grip.
 I am interested in trading for a Government sized 1911, but will consider all offers. I like a wide variety of guns and calibers, I also reload 9mm, 45 acp, and 357 sig so a combination of weapons and reloading supplies will be looked at closely. I could use a good spotting scope if you have one you would like to pair with something else to make it a more appealing offer. I would also be willing to trade for a Walther PPK/S All German or Sig P230SL all German pistol plus cash.

I do not need to get rid of this gun so if the right deal does not come along I will keep this in the safe, I am wanting to trade it as I am really wanting a 1911. I would also consider a pistol in 10 mm like a S&W or Colt, I'm not to fond of Glock 10mm pistols.
 Trade should be in the Hampton Roads area, FTF, with 2 forms of ID and we will do a bill of sale. So no felons. Will consider a cash price as well."

Plus I have a Chiappa Firearms M4-22 .22 lr dedicated upper so you can do low cost training. The first two trips to the range are on me, since I am including 100 rds of Federal .223 and 130 rounds of .22lr. Two 30 round metal 5.56 mags with a dual mag clip and one 28 round 22lr magazine are included. 
Honestly this upper is truly a tier one AR product as good as anything out there. It has a 15' Samson EVO rail with additional small rails you can put anywhere, a NP3 Coated BCG, a smooth mid-length gas system, and a barrel that shot a 1.1"" five shot group at 100 yards(see pic). I hate to let it go, but need the funds. The Sionics upper is used, just purchased two months ago, everything else is new in box. The polymer lower has a decent trigger. You will probably want to add a red dot or similar optic. 
The price is FIRM, no trades, face to face only. I prefer to do business with a CCW holder, so if you have one, note it in your email. I will take the ad down promptly upon sale. 
If you don't need the 22 upper I will take $1650 for the 5.56 rifle and gear, or $1950 for the entire package.

If you want to great long range rifle with the ability for close range also this is your gun, very well balanced rifle. I am only selling to buy something different since I have several other long range and short range rifles.

I have lowered the price to be firm at $2000, I don't need to sell gun.  I really like it, however I have other long range guns thus the reason this one doesn't get used.  This is a very good deal for a higher end AR-15 and you don't have to wait on the CBI for 7+ days.  I am only looking for cash."

FMJ style bullet (Remington calls it ""metal case""). The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel junk (save and sell the brass back here on Armslist if you don't want to reload them and recoup $2-$4 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 27 boxes available. Price is $20/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

ONLY 223 ammo I've seen in a retail store in the last couple weeks was $30 for 20, and there were only a handful of those even left.

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. 5 box minimum on orders I have to ship."

Specs: Caliber (5.56x45) Chamber, Barrel Length (16""), Barrel Twist (1:7), M4 Feed Ramps, Barrel Profile (Government Profile Barrel), Material (CrMoV 4150 Barrel), Coating (Melonite Barrel Lining), Melonite Upper Receiver (Dry Film Lubed), T Marked Gas System, Mid Length Fore Arm, M4 Hand Guards Flash Hider, A2 Flash Hider, Overall Length: 25"", Overall Weight (4.23 lbs.) The mid-length piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. Huldra's Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome. Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. This upper is brand new in the box. It is 100% ready to attach to any lower in this caliber. $900"

Has flip down rear sight, rimfire 3/8 grooved top.  No rust or pitting, a few minor wear marks.  This rifle is one of those ""click clack"" Savage/Stevens rifles.  It's a slow soft semi auto action.  If you hold the trigger when you shoot (proper marksmenship follow thru), the action stays open, release the trigger, it closes and you shoot again.  It works the same as others if you just pull and release trigger also.

The Huldra 5.56 Midlength Evo-Slank Upper (Ultra Lite Piston Upper) is a .625"" lite profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The mid-length gas system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and rear sight for quicker sight acquisition. The gas system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. With the combination of the .625 ultra lite pencil barrel, the Samson Evolution hand guard, and the new reduced radius permanently affixed flash hider, we now have the lightest dedicated gas upper on the market. With the patented Adams Arms system, you'll have an upper that will run longer than any other AR upper you own.  Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions.

This rifle began its life as a Rock River Arms A2 LAR-15. The upper was sent to White Oak Armaments, one of the top gunsmiths for service rifle competitors in the US. They completely tore it down and reworked it starting around a Pac Nor match grade stainless steel post-ban barrel with 11 degree target crown. The barrel is 1 in 7 twist with a Wylde Chamber. It is free floating under the handguard. They matched the bolt face to the chamber and installed a .62 front sight blade. The rear sight was installed and features ¼ MOA adjustments per click. I currently have a .46 rear sight hooded aperature, but have several other sizes for it. The lower was worked over with a two stage jewell trigger that is adjustable for pull and overtravel and breaks like glass. I have installed lead in the buttstock to perfectly balance the rifle. This is a heavy rifle, but that makes it rock solid in position. On my current competition load of a BR2 bench rest primer, 25.4 grains of Varget and a Sierra Match King 75.gr bullet, this rifle will shoot 3/8” groups consistently at 100 yards from bench rest.

It shoots better than I do, that’s for sure. The best I’ve managed to post with it is Expert, but I don’t get enough time in at the range to make Master or High Master. Such is life. :P

This rifle is built to spec for NRA and Civilian Marksmanship Program Matches and comes with a Turner All-Weather 1907 competition sling and hard case. No ammo, no magazines included. This rifle has had roughly 500 rounds put through it since it was worked over."

This rifle was born when our Fed gov’t decided in Regulation ATF 922R that any new firearm could not have more than 10 imported parts in it. At the time the Heckler and Koch model 91 chambered in 7.62 NATO was one of the most popular rifles around and for good reason…

They run like tanks and are very accurate!

This is the civilian version of the German G3 design that has been used by their military since the 1950’s. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_G3

After the ban on imports, JLD industries bought the engineering and machining from HK to manufacture the model 91 here in the states. These rifles have had several evolutions since the original offering and are rock solid performers. here is the current model listing:

http://www.ptr91.com/rifles

Here are the specs for this particular variation:

18” Button-rifled heavy target barrel in 1 in 12 right hand twist
Semi-auto recoil operated
20 rd box magazine fed
Rotary diopter rear sight with bullet drop compensation set for 100,200,300 and 400 yards
The rifle comes with 15 Magazines, a Brugger and Thomet Picatinny rail mount for optics mount (150 bucks on its own), hard case, sight tool and manual

Bolt and trigger group are manufactured by HK, all other parts are JLD

The trigger is pretty darned good for a rifle of this type

Rifle has about 1000 rounds put down the pipe in its lifetime

To feed this rifle I have for sale 4x200 rds of NATO 7.62 ammo manufactured by Fabrique National of Belgium. Headstamp is 1977 manufacture. The only Military Surplus ammo more accurate and reliable than this is the Lithuanian variety and you can’t find either of them anywhere. If anyone offers them for sale, they are snapped up in seconds. These are berdan primed cases, so they require a berdan decapping die to reload them."

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm the SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm."

A flak jacket or flak vest is a form of body armor designed to provide protection from case fragments (""frag"") from high explosive weaponry, such as anti-aircraft artillery (""flak""), grenades, some round shot used in shotguns and land mines and other lower-velocity projectiles. It is not designed to protect against bullets fired from small-arms such as rifles or handguns. However, certain flak jackets are able to sustain certain gunshots, dependent on the armor, the gun, and the distance that the bullet has travelled.-wikipedia"

This particular example is a Walther ""ac"" built in 1944.  I appears that the stock and upper handguard are not original - but they are very nice reproductions and include clearly defined Waffenamts.

The gas cylinder (electropencil), receiver (stamped), bolt (electropencil), fire pin housing (stamped), and bolt carrier (stamped) are numbers-matching.  The barrel is hallmarked ""bys"" so it is not apparently matching.

While the original gas piston is included with the purchase of the rifle, I replaced it with one made by Apfeltor Waffenfabrik - you can look up this great company on the web.  This gas cylinder allows you to change inserts and regulate the blowback gases and prevent potential damage to the receiver.  I have a couple different sized-aperture inserts included.

All other parts on the rifle are believed to be original including the magazine.  This weapon does not have a sling or cleaning rod.

The price for this piece of history is $2200.  I prefer to do face-to-face purchases only."
