A bullet guide has been added that lets you use less expensive aftermarket hi cap magazines such as the 30 round magazine in the photo.

In 1974 The Russian Army replaced the 7.62x39 with this caliber. The round is lighter to carry and has less recoil than a 7.62x39 but it has a high velocity. There is an abundance of cheap surplus ammo in this caliber. You can find ammo for around 11 cents a round. Since there is less recoil it's easier to stay on target with a follow up shot as there is less muzzle jump. This Saiga rifle can fire in quick succession due to the energy that escapes from the barrel bore to the gas cylinder. The Saiga-5.45x39 auto loading hunting rifles are intended for hunting big and medium-sized game under various climatic conditions. The rifles are developed on the base of the venerable Kalashnikov assault rifle and are chambered for the following cartridge: Saiga-5.45x39 cartridge, this rifle won't let you down.

Glashaus Warranty  
Here at Glashaus Firearms we stand behind our work. However, a builder’s warranty is only good if the customer takes advantage of it...

To ensure that less scrupulous individuals do not use our commitment to Quality work to take advantage of us, some guidelines have been established

1. If you have a problem with a Glashaus Firearms built weapon. Notify us as soon as the problem manifests itself. We’ll probably ask the usual round of questions. The warranty period is 30 days. Waiting months or years to bring up a problem, or bringing it up on a public Internet forum as a smear will negate your warranty.

2. ANY home gunsmithing, modification, grinding, filing, drilling, hammering etc… negates your warranty.

3. Glashaus Firearms will not offer, nor reimburse customers; either initial or subsequent buyers of Glashaus Firearms built weapons, for their shipping TO Glashaus Firearms for work to be completed. Glashaus Firearms will, however, pay for return shipping once warranty work is done.

4. If Glashaus Firearms offers to repair a weapon that we’ve worked on, and advises customer to send it back, and customer does not, but rather sends weapon to ANOTHER smith/builder for his critique or evaluation. Please do not insult us by expecting us to pay for it.

5. Warranties are handled by the manufacturer. Warranty claims need to be directed to the manufacturer, as warranties are between the owner (that's you) and the warrantor. However if you need service or warranty work on a new piece of equipment and need our help in accessing them, we will be glad to answer any questions or help you get in contact with the right party.

Wood stock and forarm, and standard black plastic grip. 

The 5.56/.223 variant of these is considered rare, and can be hard to find. I bought this thinking it would be great to have a .223 AK since I have a few ARs. But it just sits in the safe. This has had about 20 rounds through it (1 box of WWB), and functions perfectly. I may even be able to include a .223 NCStar 3-9x40 scope.  

This is offered as For Sale/For Trade, but I am specifically looking to sell to fund the purchase of a stainless Colt Delta Elite 10mm. I would also consider trade for a Delta Elite and I will add the appropriate $cash$ to make up the difference in value.

My buddy got tired of pushing the factory PIN in and out with a bullet, so I made him one of these and he really likes it. 
This PIN is made from carbon steel and has been parkerized. Parkerizing is a phosphate conversion coating which protects the surface from corrosion and increases wear resistance. The coloring matches the stock pretty well too.
The mono-cut knurl grip knob provides a good grip for removal of the pin, but it fits in the left or right side of the gun to not be in your way while shooting.

The Model M-39 is well known for its accuracy, and at 9½ pounds it absorbs more recoil than the 8¾ pound Russian M-91/30s on the market today.  I have owned this rifle for 9 years.  It has made 1 trip to the range where I fired 20 rounds of Czech Silver-tip before cleaning it thoroughly and storing it.  I have kept it meticulously clean and protected, and its condition reflects this care.  See photos.  It has a beautifully figured (""tiger stripe"") pistol grip stock with the normal plug repairs, a square post-war splice, and 3 so-called ""kill notches"" on the forend.  The front sight is adjustable for windage and the rear sight is adjustable for elevation.  The bore is bright and sharp.  Trigger has smooth take-up and a crisp break.  Comes with the cleaning rod and ammo pouch pictured.

Gun has about 40 rounds through it. It is just too heavy for the kind of terrain I hunt now. This rifle has a 26 inch heavy barrel that will allow full velocity to develop from the 308 cartridge. The heavy barrel lends the rifle a nice steady weight (8.5 pound rifle) for shooting off a rest, and the varmint contour increases sustained fire accuracy. (it resists heating better than lighter contour barrels)

The stock is a varmint style synthetic.

This is a real tack driver right out of the box. One and a half inch groups at 100 yard with cheap Remington Express ammo. Groups were one inch and under at 100 yards with Black Hills match ammo.

The HALEY ""SKIMMER"" ENHANCED CARRY TRIGGER SYSTEM gives your Glock the performance of a stock 1911. Manufactured using 100% OEM parts, all of the metal components are individually hand polished to a mirror finish for consistent, reliable action. The mated metal surfaces glide freely across each other, adding a smooth short transition into a predictable wall. The trigger break is crisp and clean, reducing muzzle movement. This is made possible by our unique pre-travel reduction modification, which is non-adjustable. Multiple inspection points are part of the production process. This system is completely drop-in with no fitting required.

We are expecting a mostly black litter with a possibility of chocolate puppies. All puppies will come with AKC registration, vet checked, 26 month health guarantee, shots, wormed, and dew claws removed. They will be ready for their new homes when they are 7 weeks old.

We will be taking deposits of $200 to reserve puppies very soon! You don't want to miss out on this litter if you want a hunting dog! We already have 3 spoken for. Prices will vary so please visit my website at:

http://cvk.yolasite.com

The Sire is a more blocky black boy with plenty of energy! He's about 75 lbs. The dam is a nice dark chocolate. She's quite a bit more laid back and reserves her energy for playtime with the other dogs or at the lake! She is about 65 lbs not pregnant.

I am selling my Steyr M9A1 9mm pistol and accessories and am asking $550 in cash, face-to-face in the DSM area. I have about $720 invested in everything listed. M9A1's have a 4"" barrel with conventional rifling and use 15 round flush-fit mags, making them comparable in size to a Glock 19. Pistol was originally purchased with one magazine and I purchased three more at around $30 each which are included.  17 round factory mags (15 round mags with an extended base pad) have been hitting the market recently and will work with this gun.

The pistol is used and has at most 800 rounds down the pipe, but that's on the high end.  There is some minor holster wear on the right side which is shown in detail in the pictures.  Has been boringly reliable for me with brass-cased ammo after replacing the extractor.  It does not like Blazer Aluminum and I have never run any steel-cased 9mm through it, so I couldn't tell you if it will like that or not.  I have taken the time to polish the moving parts in the trigger system and I have replaced the steel striker spring retaining clip with delrin cups by Big Taco.  The pull weight has not been modified, however I have a reduced power striker spring (also by Big Taco) that I can include for free if you wish.  It should not be used for carry as it could cause light strikes. 

There are four mags that come with the pistol, all are 15 round capacity.  Three of the bodies have 14 round witness holes, but will hold 15 rounds.  The fourth magazine is newer production and is marked correctly with a witness hole for the 15th round.  These are all factory mags.

There are two holsters that go with this gun - the first is a right-hand OWB custom kydex holster similar in style to a Raven Concealment holster.  It is made by Keith of Controlled Chaos Arms and was molded specifically to fit this gun - not a blue gun.  It has an FBI cant and 1.5"" belt loops. It rides high and tight for good concealment and can be adjusted slightly for increased ride height or +/- cant.  I paid around $60 for this holster.

The second holster is a right-hand Blade-Tech ""Level II Tactical"" thigh rig.  It has a standard thumb break and adjustable friction retention, as well as a quick detach belt loop. I paid around $120 shipped for this holster.

I will not sell this pistol to you if you do not have a current IA permit to acquire or permit to carry."

Total Retail price: $2,520.00

Asking Price: $2,200.00!!

Note: ALL original parts will come with this rifle, this includes the stock, foregrip, trigger group, scope w/case, trigger pin retaining wire, front sight and muzzle brake. You can return this PSL back to its original condition if you do not like the tacti-cool look!
The original trigger group w/ hammer, wire trigger pin retainer, front sight block w/pins, muzzle brake and scope case are not shown in the pictures but they WILL come with the rifle!

This rifle has been well kept and cleaned after every range day to insure no rusting. The rifle cut down to 20” has greatly increased the accuracy of this rifle. It also makes it much more manageable for carry or hunting purposes. The tapco muzzle brake also greatly reduces the muzzle climb and felt recoil of this heavy round even more so than the original brake. There are ZERO cycling issues from the barrel cut and the brass will sling 6-7ft off to your 2 o’clock position consistently. I have had zero failures to extract, cycle, chamber or eject out of this rifle."
