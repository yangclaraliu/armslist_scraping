Perfect condition. It's been used for maybe 5 minutes of runtime. These have been discontinued by Surefire, which make them a bit rare. Here's the specs on the light from the Surefire website. 

SureFire 6P Defender LED Flashlight 6PDL-BK

Compact (pocket sized), high-intensity LED flashlight for tactical, outdoor, self-defense, and general use. Its virtually unbreakable light emitting diode (there's no filament to burn out or break) generates a smooth, brilliant beam with four times the light of a larger D-cell flashlight—bright enough to temporarily blind an aggressor. And if 80 lumens of blinding light is not enough to make your point with an aggressor, then the 6P LED Defender features a crenellated Strike Bezel® as another line of defense. The electronically regulated, super-efficient LED doesn't just generate a lot of light; it continues producing useful light levels for 11 hours on a single set of batteries. A strong yet lightweight, anodized aluminum body resists crushing, bending, and the elements, and O-ring seals keep dust, dirt, and moisture out. Its compact size, high output, extended runtime, and its Strike Bezel make the 6P LED Defender a great choice for personal protection, but it's also perfect for tactical applications, the great outdoors, and ideal as an everyday carry light.

FEATURES Virtually indestructible, electronically regulated light emitting diode (LED) has no filament to burn out or break; lasts for thousands of hours Crenellated Strike Bezel® provides enhanced self-defense capability Precision reflector creates smooth beam with no spots or rings Rugged aerospace-grade aluminum body with Type II anodizing in glossy black Coated Pyrex® window protects LED and reflector while maximizing light transmission O-ring sealed; weatherproof Tailcap switch: press for momentary-on, click for constant-on Patented tailcap lockout prevents accidental light activation Batteries included

The GSG-522 has the established features of MP5-Style-Rifles, but with visual improvements which also meet a better functional purpose. First the better grip of the cocking lever, second the improved open sights for faster aiming, and third the GSG-522 comes with a removable Weaver Rail, which allows the customer to fix an optical device at customer's option. 

Less than 1000 rounds have been put through her and she runs like a dream. Super fun, inexpensive gun. I built her as a project, but now that I'm finished, it's time to move on to the next.

I built this as ""THE"" Zombie Apocalypse Weapon, and have taken VERY good care of it. With it's lightweight ammo, folding capability for close quarters combat, and tactical light for when the power gives, there's nothing I'd rather have at my arm.

I have searched all over the internet and can find very few other examples of this early gun in this caliber, most seem to be in 38 colt or 38 S&W, or even 32 caliber which have a shorter frame and smaller cartridge.  Those I have found were in far worse shape and asking much more money in some cases.  This is the best deal out there on the first issue in this caliber in a 4"" original gun. (all 3 serial numbers do match)

This was manufactured 86 years ago and is still in great shape, no rust, no pitting, very nice finish and the action smooth as butter and tight as a frog's butt.  I don't know how to rate older firearms but I would definitely  shoot it, and I might still keep it. It looks better in person as the photos reflect too much light.

Of course I prefer CCW holders, but I would still have the bill of sale signed because it protects both you and me.

A link below with more pictures. Email me your number if you would like to talk. I am on Mountain Time so let me know your state so I am not calling too late. Hello and thanks for looking. I am selling a MetroArms American Classic II chambered in a .45 ACP. I am the rightful owner of the gun. I purchased it last month from a friend. Upon purchasing it I was told that the gun uses only certain types of ammo due to it sticking between the feed rail and barrel, with the .45 ammo I have, I have a hard time getting my ammo to chamber. If you can fix it, you can have a great gun at a great price, plus you get all the extras listed below. I am the second owner as the guy I purchased it from has owned it since new. What you see is what you get. I am not a gunsmith and I purchased another gun in it's place. It comes with 1 extra barrel; the original and another. I do not know the make of the extra barrel. It also comes with 2 clips which 1 is a 8 round clip and the other is a 7 along with a right handed holster made by blackhawk and made in the USA size 3 that fits the gun well and holds a clip. The grips are rubber and made by Hogue and are in nice shape. The gun looks nice. It does show a little wear. It has a small scratch about 1/4 inch long on the right hand side next to the hammer on the slide. Forgive me if I don't know the proper terms, but it has an exteded thumb release put on. It also has a suppressor on the spring to help with recoil and the trigger has what I was told a 3.5lb pull as the guy I bought it from has problems with hand strength due to arm surgeries. Look at all the pictures I have provide. I do show 1 picture in my set of what the ammo does when it's stuck. If you have any dought or questions, please email me first. I can ship this in state for $20.00 or just pick it up. I accept money order or check or if you want to do paypal as long as they know it's not a gun, 3% will be added as they charge me. I will ship immediatly if I get a money order or if you pay by check, the check must clear before shipping. Thank you for looking. Link to more photos, you must copy and paste this in your address bar.

It will include dynamic interactive lectures, skills labs, and training scenarios. It will not include any firearms training. Scenarios may include simunitions and force on force depending upon students background and abilities. 

This course is designed to give you, individually, what you need to know to save someone 'IF' they can by saved from blunt and penetrating trauma associated with lethal force encounters. While we will talk about and use all the latest tactical medical gear we will also strongly reinforce the principles and improvisation of these treatments because lets face it, who walks around with a trauma bag on them?

Some of what this course will cover:

Patient and Situation Assessment

Care Under Fire

Airway Management

Treating Respiratory Emergency Caused by Trauma

Controlling Hemorrhage

Emergency Medical Kits

Improvised Medical Devises

Survival Psychology

I have a Buckmark 22lr Pistol for sale. Beautiful gun, incredibly accurate, well balanced and very well reviewed. I bought this gun to shoot rabbits with while deer/elk hunting. Its got less than 525 rounds through it, i still have the partial box of shells i bought with it. Email and we can work something out. Willing to meet, you can inspect it inside out, upside down, no pressure. You WILL be impressed. they sell for 325+. I need a concealed carry weapon, and dont have the funds to spend on it, i dont use the Buckmark, so i dont mind letting it go.

THIS HAS BEEN SOLD. Another will be available when I get it out of storage, In identical condition, aesthetically it is in better condition however, with slightly less use. I will have new pictures available upon request.

What I have is a nice old 1913 frame and internals
And a 1918 Colt-A. J. Savage slide.

The frame is marked with the WGP inspectors mark which is correct for the serial number which is No475XX. The ""US Property"" mark looks to have been taken off when it was refinished long, long ago.

The slide has the single block, 3-line address on the left side and ""Model OF 1911.U.S. ARMY"" on the right.

The firebluing on the grip screw heads, slide release, safety and trigger can still be seen. 

The stocks on it are not the diamond stocks I've seen on others of this era, but are still hand checkered and look to be a very red walnut.

This 1911 functions flawlessly.
I'm not looking to sell it as I don't know what to ask, so please don't ask for a cash price. I am looking for trades of antique Winchesters and Colts as well as others. I'm open to pretty much anything nice.
