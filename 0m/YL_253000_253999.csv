This Yugo has had the trigger and bolt professional modified. The trigger was tuned to reduse the overall travel and lbs of pull. It was originally a very long, gritty and heavy (13lb) trigger pull as most SKS rifles are! It was modded to pull up over 80% of the travel, smoothed out the grit completely and dropped to a 5-6lb trigger pull! The bolt was modified to allow for tactical reloads (you can drop the mag without having to open the bolt) allowing for half mag changes. The bolt also has a springloaded new firing pin. All of these modifications were done by a professional gunsmith who specializes in SKS mods of this nature and that doesnt come cheap! The total mods to this rifle ran me $200.00 alone!

These are some guns I either took as trade or for whatever don't shoot and looking to sell or trade for something more in line with my collection.

First is an M1 Carbine. I don't know much about it. I believe someone either refinished the stock or it was made for civilian since it doesn't seem to have a military finish. It is stamped Universal so I assume that is the mfg. I couldn't find the mag so I just bought a couple new 20 round to go with it. Asking $450.

Second is a Kahr CW40. A nice little compact in 40 S&W. This is in pretty good condition. It has a one single stack magazine which makes the grip nice and small for someone with smaller hands. I believe it holds 6+1. Asking $425.

Next is a Chiappa 1911-22. This is a 22 on a 1911 style frame. Comes with 3 magazines, box, manual, etc. I believe it has had a trigger job done also. Asking $300.

SOLD THE RUGER-Finally, A Ruger P85 in 9mm. This comes with 2 15 round mags. This one shows some wear but would be a good shooter. Asking $290.

What I did with mine was three coats of Danish Oil and three coats of Liquid Gold. You will have to apply Liquid Gold periodically to keep the wood in good condition. It usually takes about a week because I let each coat dry for 24 hours before applying the next one. Yes I do a light rub with steel wool and a rag between coats.

Guns will come with two factory magazines each, and the pistol in its factory box and comes with the extra rear peep sight. I'll also throw in a cheapo universal holster from Wal-Mart that fits this thing like a glove. I'm asking $400 cash firm for the pair. Just the pistol - $150. Just the carbine - $275.

No offers for less will be entertained, however, I will be happy to drive a reasonable distance to meet you to complete the sale.

These have a flattop upper receiver with a 16 barrel that has the 1-9 twist. These rifles come with quad rail handguards and gas blocks. The lower receivers are the PLUMCRAZY brand. The lower receiver and the internals are polymer and have a lifetime warranty. By using polymer it shaves 1 lb off the overall weight of the rifle. This is the same material that made Glock famous. The trigger comes from the manufacturer with an estimated 4 lb pull.  These are being sold for $550.00 plus tax. At this price these rifles will not be for sale long. I do not accept trades & I do not reserve rifles. The first ones with the cash gets the guns. If interested call and ask for Shane REDACTED

Due to this firearm being out of production it's rare and difficult to find in .45 ACP (8+1) as the U.S. is the only country that uses this ammunition.  But parts are easily had from Sig Sauer.  I have shot a .40 S&W (10+1) Mauser M2, and it's just as nice, but has larger recoil due to its higher velocity.  Both caliber versions have the extremely solid Sig feel -- BMW with Chevy engine.

The gun has factory Sig night sights, Hogue grips, 3 Sig 15 round mags, and 2 Mec-gar mags, one 18 rounds and the other 20 round. Just and FYI Mec-gar manufactures Sigs factory mags so they are all top quality and about 40 dollors a piece. The gun will come with all that, the original grips and the original case, paperwork, etc... I am selling it because I am looking to build a race gun. Any questions feel free to ask.

This Vintage pump action repeating BB gun functions and shoots. You’d think your shooting a Winchester 1890 or a Remington Model 12. In 1934 Daisy introduced the Buck Jones Special BB gun. It was Daisy’s second air rifle to be sponsored by a famous Hollywood cowboy star of that time. As you can see in the pictures, this has fancy engraving on the frame and an inlaid compass (which works) and sundial on the stock. To use the sundial you inserted a match in the hole.

The bluing on the metal is still pretty good considering its around 75 years old. The wood is in good shape also but has some dings on the right side. These guns were made in Plymouth Michigan.

Here is a very scarce variant of Taurus's Tracker series of revolvers, the Model 450 chambered in .45 Colt Caliber. Barrel is full shroud 2 inch ported with 6 vents. only a few that Taurus had on hand and sold early in 2008. Fjiestad's Blue Book indicates that the model was only produced from 1999 until 2002, and there are definitely no more .45 Colt Revolvers in Taurus's offerings for the past three years. This one has its original box with correct label . This specimen is excellent mechanically; bore, cylinder chambers and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent. It is a lock variant, and comes with two keys for its inconspicuous patented Taurus Hammer Lock. Capacity is 5 rounds of .45 Colt, and weight empty is a Night-Guard rivaling 20 ounces. We're offering this unique Taurus .45 Colt Tracker for only $ 549.95

It's had the feed ramp polished, the barrel has been polished, it's got an aluminum trigger and hammer, both polished, beavertail safety, extended thumb safety, and it's been very reliable. 

I've put a few hundred rounds through it, and it's a pretty accurate firearm. Occasionally will jam, but seems to be due to cheap magazines. It comes with 5 Chip McCormick magazines, the one that it came with and two off brand ones for a total of 8. I have not had a problem using the Chip McCormick magazines, especially the standard 8 round ones. 

I can also throw in a leather holster. 

If you're looking to get a nice new 1911 this is the one for you. It's got a lot of newer, custom parts to it, comes with 8 mags and a holster. So I'm pretty firm on the price, I'll also consider trades. Just let me know what you got. Preference on trades would be:

M1, .357 revolvers 4'' or shorter, most anything by Beretta, pump action shotguns in 12 or 20... or show me what you have!"
