I have a ready to fish 1988 Alumacraft Superbandit bass boat for sale, it has been a good boat and we have used it regularly. I recently upgraded, and need to sell.. I have done a good bit of work to this boat and the trailer as well. 

Boat size is 17ft 8 inch long, 74"" wide.

Most of the carpet is new, the front deck wood was replaced and recarpeted last fall, the carpet in the floor and rear deck carpet is new in the last couple of months. The front deck has a brand new butt seat and the rear deck has a brand new folding seat. 

There is a cooler between the riding seats and you can also fit plenty of rods in the rod locker. Navigation lights work, bilge pump works, I re-done alot of the wiring as several guys over the years had left tons of unused wires, so the wiring should be easy to follow. 

The engine, a 1988 88 SPL, is in great shape and the carbs were rebuilt early last summer, the lower unit oil was changed last fall. I won't say it always starts on the first try everytime, but starts pretty easy and has never left us stranded! Power trim also works great. The trolling motor is a 36v motorguide, but I only have it hooked up to 24v. Battaries hold charge well, can troll all day, the starting battery is separate and is charged by the engine just fine. There is a fish finder on the console and I will also include a handheld GPS that I used a few times times when fishing a new area. 

This past spring I put new wheel hubs and bearings on it with bearing buddies, as well as new tires on the trailer, the spare is also in like new condition (new last summmer).

The cover was purchased last summer and is in good shape, fits the boat and motor really well.

I will include a couple of simple life vests, the flotation pad, the horn, a plastic paddle and the fire extinguisher, which I believe is all that is legally required.

Asking $2800, best way to reach me is email or text, my work doesn't allow me to take many personal calls during the day, but if you prefer you can try to call after 5:00 PM. I have no problem meeting you at ditto landing or something to test it out, but before going through all that trouble, I'd like to know you are a serious buyer and have money in hand.

Has aftermarket modifications and done nicely. Clean and clear title in hand, if you have been looking for a motorcycle that's you own heres your chance. It will need street fairings, I sold the ones I bought it with and purchased track fairings. Reason being is I wanted to to do a few track days to advance as a rider. 

Street fairings will run anywhere from $500-$800, and are very easy to install. I've gotten a few text from people that are interested then change their mind because they think its a project. I can basically install the front nose fairing, wind screen, mirrors, left/right fairings and rear tail in under 30 minutes.

 ( not a ""MUSTANG"" ) this is a mini 1911, the primary difference is the Goverment has a barrel bushing design just like the original full size 1911s - the newer mustang has a bull barrel design ( no bushing) that is less expensive to produce. The more expensive govt .380s were expensive even back in the 80s and even more expensive in the ""stainless"" finish. Due to high cost a low number of these were produced simply because the demand was not high back then for small pistols .

Will trade for AK-47 or fine handgun. Otherwise $550 firm.  Manufactured in New Haven Conn.
One of the primary reasons for the .30-30's popularity amongst deer hunters is its light recoil. Average recoil from a typical 150-grain (9.7 g) load at 2,390 feet per second (730 m/s) in a 7.5-pound (3.4 kg) rifle is 10.6 pounds-force (47 N) of felt recoil at the shooter's shoulder. This, combined with the cartridge's ability to take the majority of large game in North America, as long as the game is within 200 yards (180 m) of the shooter, results in a highly effective hunting round.

(I WILL REMOVE THIS AD WHEN IT HAS BEEN SOLD.)

I am looking to sell my CZ-82, it's been a great gun for me, but I'd like to get something along the lines of a full sized handgun.

This is an excellent shooter, DA/SA, ambidextrous mag release and safety.12+1 capacity, fires the 9x18 Makarov round. I have fired maybe 300 rounds since I got this gun, and the polygonal rifling, coupled with the fixed barrel makes this gun very accurate, I was easily able to put 12 rounds into a 3 1/2 inch group at 15 yards the first time I shot it. Some wear on the slide, the finish has chipped off, this is very common with these guns as the finish wasn't very good, but gun functions flawlessly, have never had a FTF or FTE.


Whole package includes

-(3) 12 rounds magazines with milled floorplates

-Black leather military surplus holster

-Desantis 106-v5 IWB leather gun holster, for ruger lc9 (also fits CZ-82 as shown nicely, the lip is a bit chewed up, dog got to it, but isn't uncomfortable or noticable when wearing and wears nicely.)

-New military surplus Leather shoulder holster rig; This is a very nice holster, just got it in yesterday, this will fit the CZ-82/82, and I believe it would fit a PA-63 or a Makarov very nicely as well. Right handed draw.

-(2) 50 round boxes of Brown bear 94 grain FMJ's

-(1) 50 round box of Prvi Partisan brass cased, reloadable 93 gr FMJ's

- 28 rounds of steel cased russian 9m mak ammo, 92 gr FMJ

-250 rounds of Buffalo Bore 9mm mak +p ammo, these are 115 gr hardcast RN firing at 1000 fps, VERY hot rounds.

-6 Glaser safety slugs

-13 rounds of Hornday XTP hollopoints

The CZ-82 has an upgraded 16lb wolff recoil spring, over the factory 14 pound, helps reduce the already tame recoil.

Comes with upgraded recoil spring, the original recoil spring, and a new firing pin spring as well.

I have fired maybe 300 rounds since I got this gun, and the polygonal rifling, coupled with the fixed barrel makes this gun very accurate, I was easily able to put 12 rounds into a 3 1/2 inch group at 15 yards the first time I shot it. Some wear on the slide, the finish has chipped off, this is very common with these guns as the finish wasn't very good, but gun functions flawlessly, have never had a FTF or FTE.

I'm really leaning towards a new handgun in .45 ACP, so if you have one and would like to trade it, you'll get first priority.




CURRENTLY HAVE OFFER FOR THE BUFFALO BORE AMMO.
If nobody sends me an offer soon for all of this, i will sell it off and it will be everything but the buffalo bore.
This is a great deal, so make sure you act now or it will be gone."

I'm Dave, a disabled veteran who enjoys target shooting, or as I call it; ""Group Therapy."" I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees. While doing research early one morning, since sleep eluded me once more and which just so happens to be Veteran's day, (HOOAH!), I stumbled up this website and figured why not?!?

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

If this works, I will definitely use this site again, but for one of those more noble causes I wrote about earlier in this early morning rambling. If you can donate to the cause, please email me via the link below.

I'm Dave, a disabled veteran who enjoys target shooting, or as I call it; ""Group Therapy."" I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees. While doing research early one morning, since sleep eluded me once more and which just so happens to be Veteran's day, (HOOAH!), I stumbled up this website and figured why not?!?

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

If this works, I will definitely use this site again, but for one of those more noble causes I wrote about earlier in this early morning rambling. If you can donate to the cause, please email me via the link below.

by Gun Talk on Tuesday, November 13, 2012 at 11:56am 

After Sunday's show, we've gotten many emails about Tom's remarks after WWP declined an interview request on Gun Talk Radio because it's a firearms-related show. We've also seen the forums that are suggesting many things that are not true. So, I'm going to lay it all out right here.
We thought it would be great to book the WWP on the Veteran's Day show to promote the organization, so I contacted them. I was flabbergasted when their PR contact, Leslie, sent me an email saying they could not participate because our show dealt with firearms. Knowing that WWP has a booth at SHOT show and various gun shows across the US, takes wounded warriors on hunts and range days, raffles guns and accessories as fundraisers, etc., their policy didn't make much sense. I forwarded the email on to Tom to get his take.
-Sarah

The following is the complete email exchange:
====================
Hello, Leslie:
Sarah forwarded me your email after I asked her to invite the Wounded Warriors Project to join me on ""Tom Gresham's Gun Talk"" radio show.

I'm stunned at your email saying that the WWP doesn't participate in an interview or activity related to firearms. Inasmuch as there are 90 million gun owners and most of them support wounded veterans, I think they would be shocked to hear that they are, by way of their hobbies, somehow not worthy of helping with the Wounded Warriors Project.

Does your policy apply also to police agencies and the military, since they are ""related to firearms?""

I'm hoping that we have misunderstood your email. Can you confirm that it is, in fact, an official policy of the Wounded Warriors Project to not do interviews with or participate in any activity related to firearms?

Thank you.
Tom Gresham

============

Good afternoon --

While we appreciate your interest in Wounded Warrior Project® (WWP) you are correct that we decline the media opportunity.

Please note the following notice that appears on our website which also applies to WWP public awareness policy and inquiries from media outlets:
http://www.woundedwarriorproject.org...rtunities.aspx

WWP does not co-brand, create cause marketing campaigns or receive a percentage or a portion of proceeds from companies in which the product or message is sexual, political or religious in nature, or from alcohol or firearms companies.

Thank you for your inquiry.

====================
Thanks for confirming that, Leslie. It was a simple opportunity to promote the WWP on a national program in an effort to send donations your way.
I'll pass along the info that you don't want or need the help of America's gun owners. 

Best regards,
Tom Gresham

=====================

Good morning --
This policy is not a judgment on those who own and use firearms – clearly every member of our armed forces has been trained in the use of firearms and then called on to use them in the course of their service to this country.

Our position regarding firearms and alcohol is in response to the struggles that many injured service members face with substance abuse and suicide and the roles those items often play in those issues.

Thank you.
LESLIE A. COLEMAN
public relations director

=============================

Hello, Leslie:

Thank you for that explanation.

I do think -- and I'm being as kind as possible -- that it's the nuttiest thing I've heard in years. Suicides are not linked to firearms. Japan has a much higher rate of suicide than does the U.S., and they have essentially no firearms. Suicide is a serious issue irrespective of the methodology used. 

This explanation doesn't pass even the most simple ""does this make sense"" test.

Your policy does, in fact, brand firearms and the companies which make them as undesirables, and by association, you are saying that those who own and use firearms for recreation, hunting, self protection, and other safe and legal uses are to be avoided.

It's certainly your option to ostracize the firearms industry, the 90 million gun owners in America, and the media which support firearms safety training. 

At this point, I feel an obligation to make sure the millions who listen to my radio show and watch my two national television series know about your policy.

I cannot fully express how much I feel you are doing a disservice to our wounded veterans, and how disappointed I am to discover this bias at the Wounded Warriors Project.

Sincerely,
Tom Gresham

Description:
The Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert (ESAPI) is a ceramic plate fielded by the US military. It was first used in the Interceptor body armor, a ballistic vest. It is now also used in the Improved Outer Tactical Vest as well as the Modular Tactical Vest, in addition to commercially available ""plate carriers"". The kevlar Interceptor vest itself is designed to stop projectiles up to and including 9x19mm Parabellum submachine gun rounds, in addition to fragmentation. To protect against higher velocity rifle rounds, SAPI or ESAPI plates are needed.

Materials and capabilities
The standard plate for the Interceptor body armor is made of boron carbide or silicon carbide ceramic.  New ESAPI plates are also made of boron carbide.  The standard plates are not given an NIJ rating, as they are tested in accordance with specific protocols for the military and not the NIJ's testing. Military testing calls for survivability of three hits from the round marked on the plate - for standard SAPI, of a caliber up to 7.62x51mm NATO M80 ball and of a muzzle velocity up to 2,750 ft/s (840 m/s). For ESAPI, a .30cal M2 AP (.30-06 black-tip armor-piercing) cartridge. This performance is only assured when backed by the soft armor of the OTV (or any soft armor which meets military requirements for protection. The ceramic plate is backed with a shield made of Spectra, a material up to 40% stronger than Kevlar, to trap any fragments of either plate or projectile and prevent them from injuring the wearer.

For sale is a set of genuine SAPI plates, size Large

Description:
The Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) is a ceramic plate fielded by the US military. It was first used in the Interceptor body armor, a ballistic vest. It is now also used in the Improved Outer Tactical Vest as well as the Modular Tactical Vest, in addition to commercially available ""plate carriers"". The kevlar Interceptor vest itself is designed to stop projectiles up to and including 9x19mm Parabellum submachine gun rounds, in addition to fragmentation. To protect against higher velocity rifle rounds, SAPI or ESAPI plates are needed.

Materials and capabilities
The standard plate for the Interceptor body armor is made of boron carbide or silicon carbide ceramic.  The standard plates are not given an NIJ rating, as they are tested in accordance with specific protocols for the military and not the NIJ's testing. Military testing calls for survivability of three hits from the round marked on the plate - for standard SAPI, of a caliber up to 7.62x51mm NATO M80 ball and of a muzzle velocity up to 2,750 ft/s (840 m/s). This performance is only assured when backed by the soft armor of the OTV (or any soft armor which meets military requirements for protection. The ceramic plate is backed with a shield made of Spectra, a material up to 40% stronger than Kevlar, to trap any fragments of either plate or projectile and prevent them from injuring the wearer.

Finish is 95-98%, Bore is EXCELLENT, you wont find a nicer bore unless you manage to find a completely unfired k98. 1.5 moa at 100 with reloads is what I was getting with this rifle and I am not the steadiest of shots.

Bolt,Floorplate,follower(Not Serial numbered but I believe correct code),sight/base,barrel are all stamped matching. The stock and handguard which are replacements(cupped buttplate) do not match. The trigger guard/bands have no numbers on them and I am just going to assume are replacements as this was a bringback with a sportered stock originally. Comes with cleaning rod and sight hood.

I have this posted on a collectors forum for $40 more, I will expect it to sell there however that means I have to pack it,ship it and use one of my boxes.
If you want it, please call me and come get it. Im lazy, I dont want to ship this thing, get tracking, insurance and wait to make sure the person in Texas or wherever is happy. Price wont go lower and at this price it wont last long. I need money for the gunshow which is the only reason this is going.

A little about the rifle

    It is an American made AK by Inter Ordinance and is a hell of a fun gun to shoot. I personally have put around 300rds through it, maybe a little more and it has worked flawlessly. I installed a Red/Green dot optic as well as a forward quad rail and a Tapco six position stock all of which are FDE in color except the optic is black. The weapon comes with everything you see on the rifle as well as the original furniture the weapon came with. It will come with the original box and two mags and a top mounted tri rail. The sell price is $800 firm. It was $750 brand new without any upgrades.
I am located in canon city and am willing to travel ""Reasonable distance"" for delivery. Please feel free to call day or night #REDACTED

Shoots great, has tapco trigger, and ergonomic hand grip, the rest is factory. I have two mags to go with it and a box of hornady zombie max ammo. I got this rifle from a friend as payment for some custom fabrication work I did for him and I want it gone. It functions great,shoots great but iv done many deployments in the army and lost many friends to AK's. So I don't like the idea of having it in my house. I know $ doesn't grow on trees these days so I am ok with trades. I'd like something I can hunt with, .223 and up. Just holler at me, ya never know. You may have exactly what im looking for.

I am getting out of reloading and have bagged up all the brass and assembled components for all the 45 ACP that I have.  There are approximately 1,800 cleaned brass cartridges (box in the center), approximately 1,000 of uncleaned brass from the range (bag on the left) and approximately 900 assembled cartridges (the bullets are 230 gr lead and the primers are CCI) (box on the right).  I strongly recommend that the assembled cartridges are dis-assembled and reloaded according to your specifications.  I really don’t like the powder in these rounds, it is just way to smoky for smokeless powder and they are a little under powered.   

Selling it all for $250.  It’s all or nothing - I will not sell just part of it.
