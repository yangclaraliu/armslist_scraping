I'll take $100 for the scope that's in new condition, and 50 dollars for the standard matte mount and rings; that's all together 50 dollars off retail price.  Offer me a cash quote and we can work it out.  

I will consider trades, such as guitars, reliable ATV, etc.  Don't hesitate to offer.  All together, it's worth 820 dollars new (Rifle, Prostaff scope, mount + rings, camo sling).

Rifle was sighted-in, but never used in a hunt (yet!).  Also, if you aren't interested, but know someone who might be, please send my mail to them because I need to sell soon.

Best,

I recently removed it from my Ar15 and installed a flat top reciever just as a personal preference. I know on the Bushmaster website they go for $121.95 without the rear sight which mine includes so I think $50 is an excellent price. Their are quite a few marks under the left side of the carry handle because I had to put a wrench through the carry handle to give me leverage when removing the reciever. Other than that their is nothing wrong with the reciever. The marks on the carry handle could be painted over I am just not educated enough on how to properly paint a firearm to do it myself.

I'm not really too found of keeping up modern firearms and want to get back into some WWII collecting. I'm up for any trades or partial trades plus cash for any WWII styled firearms like another M1 Garand, Thompson M1, G43, Luger P08, P38, C96, BAR, Bren gun, etc etc. They do not have to be all original, I actually prefer good condition rebuilt or service grade weapons as they have more historical significance IMHO and I dont like buying guns I cant shoot. I would also be looking for a 9mm Beretta 92 (gotta keep one modern gun around for work, I'm an armed guard).

Let me know. I""ll take offers, but I""m pretty firm on the price, the gun wasn't cheap. (Pic is from a website as I have no camera available to me. It does come with a optic very much like the aimpoint pictured, but it is not any aimpoint)"

The antique weapon has signs of age, and more than likely saw action in WW1 and possibly WW2. Not in perfect condition and price reflects value.

THE GOOD: The best thing, and why it is relatively valuable: all serial numbers match and this antique weapon is 100% original, even down to the real wood grips. The Germans were very meticulous about serial numbers, and gave virtually every piece of this weapon a serial. We can disassemble together if you want to verify.

THE BAD: One hand grip is missing a screw. I know of a website where you can order original Luger parts and they have original screws in stock, I'll buy them for you, or you can supply your own and deduct your costs from the purchase price (as long as it's less than $50)

THE UGLY: The ammunition for this antique weapon can be expensive, Fiocci starts at $25 or so per box, Winchester is about $55. I wouldn't shoot it, consider this a rare antique and if you blow it up trying to fire it, well, sorry for ya.

Grab a great deal and a piece of military history at a great bargain. $700 negotiable, willing to work with the highest offer. Call Wes @ (318) two one eight 6015 to view or inquire."

This is a copy of the Beretta 8000 (Cougar) series pistols that are manufacted by Beretta of Italy. 

Stoeger Cougar: Marketing and distribution of the Cougar has been transferred to Stoeger Industries, a subsidiary of Beretta. The firearms are made in Turkey, using Beretta factory tooling

They first appeared on the market in 1994 as a more compact alternative to the full-sized Beretta 92 service pistol in order to offer a compromise between concealability, ease of carry, accuracy and firepower.
It was originally developed for the .40S&W cartridge, which was a new cartridge at the time. It was later also manufactured for other calibers, such as 9 x 19 mm, .357 SIG and .45 ACP. These pistols are suitable for use by police and for civilian self-defense.[

This is the 9 x 19 mm, 15-round magazine capacity model

The F specification is the basic version with double action trigger, exposed hammer, and ambidextrous safety/decocking levers (located on the slide).

Stoeger Cougar: Marketing and distribution of the Cougar has been transferred to Stoeger Industries, a subsidiary of Beretta. The firearms are made in Turkey, using Beretta factory tooling. Stoeger now produces Cougars in 9x19mm, .45 ACP, and .40 S&W. Only the full size models are being produced

Prior to its acquisition by Beretta, Stoeger was located in New Jersey. Stoeger commissioned various small companies in Germany to manufacture a replica of the Luger, which it imported. It later sold an American-made version of the Luger in 1994. The pistol was all stainless steel and was in 9 m/m and sold as the American Eagle Luger with 4"" and 6"" barrels. Stoeger has owned the name ""Luger"" starting around 1924.Stoeger also distributed in the United States some firearms made by Fabrique Nationale (FN).

The North American Mini Revolver may be somewhere outside of the realm of guns we usually think of as snubnose revolvers, but it is a short barreled, compact revolver, and it performs many of the same functions we associate with snubnoses: it is very concealable and easy to carry, and it is a dedicated self-defense pistol. 

The revolver under examination here is the NAA .22 Long Rifle with the 1 1/8 barrel. The NAA Mini Revolvers are made in .17 WMR, .22 Short, .22 Long Rifle, and .22 Magnum, and all except the .22 short are offered in several barrel lengths. This pistol is 4? long, stem to stern, and weighs 4.5 ounces. It is built with very high production values. Its almost like a piece of jewelry. While these little guns may look like toys, they are solidly built and enjoy a reputation for superb reliability and function.

I have since moved, and I have come into some luck financially, so I do not NEED to sell this rifle anymore. 

So I'd like to see what I can possibly trade it for.
This rifle has 1100 in it, and the parts are worth more than that. So something of comparable value please. I will downtrade if you throw a little cash on it. I will cut a deal though, I am not looking to get an exact match in value.

I am specifically in the market for a new handgun. Sig P226 in 9mm(Navy model would be awesome), USP 9mm, and 1911's(rock island, springfield, kimber) all interest me.
Lemme know what you got. 

I will also take 950 cash, if interested in buying it outright. I'll even throw in a mag and 100rds of ammo, as an extra little something.
If interested in just the upper, I will sell it complete for 560. 

Components are as follows:
BCM upper, w/t marks and M4 feed ramps, 20'' chrome lined 1:7 twist barrel, Magpul BUIS, chrome bolt carrier group, BCM gunfighters charging handle, Knights Armament RAS handguard, DSA(DS arms) ZM4 lower, 5 position telescoping Vltor stock, and Magpul MOE pisol grip.
Rifle is UNFIRED, NEW. The RAS handguard is the only used part.

Serious offers only please. Armslist has about lost its luster for me, because of the amount of attitude most responses contain. If you can't be semi-professional, or at least mature, don't waste my time."

He said he'd could get a better deal by making a few at once.  I ordered two, now realize I only need one.  So I'm entertaining trades for one of these.

These are both Mauser actions.  Both have the metal finished in Duracoat.  The barrels are new sporter barrels and have fewer than 20 rounds through each.  Each has been glass bedded, and the barrels are free floated.  The triggers are original mauser, but have been lightened.  One stock is in fiberglass with a rubber butt pad, and the other a sporterized military stock finished in tru-oil.  I have three scoping options, that you can pick depending on your preference an old burris (I think), a pro-point red dot, or a 6X18 adjustable objective simmons pro hunter.  same one here: http://www.midwayusa.com/viewproduct/?productnumber=888936&cm_mmc=Froogle-_-Optics%20-%20Scopes%20-%2012X%20and%20Greater-_-PriceCompListing-_-888936   The picture make the finish look smoky, but they are totally flat matte black.

I'll also throw in 40 rounds of 308 Australian 1980's ball ammo and a case.  If you choose the Simmons scope, you'll need medium or high rings to mount it to clear the bolt throw.  Look around... this is a great deal.

I'm looking for fair trades... name your stock, scope combination.  

I'm interested in all quality firearms from 22's to belted magnums and handguns.... I'm not that interested in shotguns, unless you have a good slug gun.  I'd love a 500 S&W and would offer one of these and cash."

The scope has some scratches on the side from sliding in the mounts.  The synthetic stock has a spot that has some rubs on it.
