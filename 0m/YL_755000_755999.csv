(Heckler & Koch GmbH of Oberndorf, Germany)

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.
Features & System Characteristics:

•	Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
•	Grooved target triggers
•	Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
•	Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
•	Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
•	Stainless steel slide
•	One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
•	No snag, bobbed hammer
•	Flared recurve trigger guard
•	Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines
•	Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
•	Ambidextrous magazine release lever
•	Contoured, extended slide release
•	Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator
•	Patented Lock-Out Safety device
•	Includes a Fobus paddle holster and hard carrying case.

Since 1959, the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on for survival should they have to punch out over a remote area. Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle today's rifle is a semi-automatic rifle which is lightweight (just 3.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear. When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, waterproof stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments. Plus, the updated receiver is grooved making it easy to top it off with your favorite optics.

This is a local ""barn"" (garage) find. 351c 2v with FMX auto transmission. The mustang was parked while in running condition in 1997 and hasn't been moved until now. The car is sitting in my garage as I found it. It doesn't run as there is no battery however it was running when parked and I don't think there would be any issues with a basic carb clean and fuel system maintenance. It is a well optioned car with power windows, steering, brakes, and AC. She is completely original and is numbers matching. A complete restoration kit of parts will also be sold with the car and I will list everything I've sorted so far. 2 front fenders ( L&R), 2 complete doors w/ glass and hardware (L&R), 1 hood, radiator, ac compressor, 2 or 3 am/fm 8 track players, 2 sets of wheel covers, front / rear valances, drive shaft, exhaust system, 1 or 2 tail lights, dash cluster, and a trunk full of misc parts and trim. I know I'm leaving some things off this list and I'll edit it as I sort through the stuff. The tires are holding air and the car rolls pretty easy. The car has a clean VA title and both ignition and trunk key. The interior is in good condition and the driver/passenger seat will need to be recovered. The back seat and head liner are both in excellent condition. I also found the original owners manual and paperwork from when the car was purchased. The car has 144k miles as it was a daily driver until taken out of service. An interesting aspect of this car is that it has a DSO code of 99 which means that it was an export car. I'm not sure if it ever actually left the country or not but it may add to the rarity of the car. Please email with questions or for more photos. The car does have some rust which is mainly in the rear panel that holds the tail lights. There is also some rust in the front fenders and behind the back tires in the rear. Thanks for looking. I would also consider trades for other vehicles (cars / trucks / motorcycles) or guns. I have this listed in other craigslist sections for $3800 - make a reasonable offer and its yours. I want this stuff out of my garage."

Excellent condition, safe kept, has had 150 rounds fired for function check, folding stock locks up tight, sights are zeroed and straight as an arrow. No problems with function, reliable as expected, as with all well-built AK rifles. Very accurate.

AK prices are all over the place right now, so it is even more difficult than usual to establish fair market value, but Impact Guns just got this rifle in stock today (http://www.impactguns.com/arsenal-ak74-krinkoff-brake-side-folding-stock-762x39-wrail-5-rd-slr107-62.aspx) and recently completed auctions on gunbroker seem to support this scary increase.

I do quite a bit of buying and selling locally on armslist as well as online, and can provide references. Buy with confidence!

I purchased this a few years ago when short-barrel rifles became legal in Alabama, but have been too distracted with other things to pursue an SBR. Hoping to find a fellow shooter to give this AK a good home.

The SAR 4800 was manufactured as a new rifle on licensed FN machinery by trained machinists according to specs with all IMBEL parts. Many franken-FAL's were cobbled together in a garage by a hobbyist. (I'm NOT referring to some of our well known smiths which turn out excellent work and have put together hundreds of FALs, I consider these as custom guns). Even at a few hundred difference which would you rather shoot?
Do you want to spend close to this or more on a ""new"" AR style .308 which is what I call a belly button gun - everybody has one? Or, would your rather buy a 20 year old gun that actually has a history and will hold it's value?

This rifle is a shooter meaning that it's what I would call fine to good shape (I tend to be on the conservative side rather than saying it's excellent shape and then having people be disappointed). The primary detriments are the bluing (or black in this case) being rubbed off in the normal areas that see use. Pictures are available on request. This comes with 6 twenty round magazines. Open to interesting trade offers as well.

M4 feeedramps, free-floated lightweight handguard, staked gas key, and just about every single option you'd expect from high end ARs.  

This is not your average ""mil-spec"" AR. This is a VERY high end rifle. Mostly designed for 3-gun competition, but makes a great collectable gun, and is very high quality.  Most AR-15s on Armslist should be priced 1/3rd of what they are asking for.  This is what this high end rifle was worth two weeks ago, before everyone jacked up the prices.

If you don't know a lot about AR15s, please talk to a friend who does, I believe he/she will explain what an amazing deal this Custom AR-15 would have been two weeks ago before the crazy price gouging, and how it's even more of a deal now.

Chambered in 300AAC Blackout (300BLK).  Do some research to find out about this awesome round.  Basically it's better than the AK round, uses a .308 bullet in an AR Platform, giving the AR15 some much needed punch!  Picture shows a 5.56 in a stock USGI Mag on the left, and a 300BLK in a stock USGI on the right.  The 300BLK uses every single AR15 stock part except the barrel! magazines, bolt, everything.

-----------------------------------
While I still can, I'm looking to pick up a particular AR that I've been wanting for a while; however, my funds are falling a bit short so I'm selling this one to make up the difference.  Ideally, I'd keep this one and get the other one but, unfortunately, that's just not an option for me so I'm hoping to get it while there is still time. We all know what's possibly coming down the pipe, though I truly hope to be proven wrong.

Anyway, I've put about 2,000 rounds (Federal or PMC) downrange with no malfunctions when in the hands of someone familiar with shooting. I don't really have any complaints in my experience with this rifle. It functions just as you would expect of an AR platform rifle.

As I am currently left with fairly unreliable transportation I will not be able to travel very far.  As such, interested buyers that are in my area or willing to drive here will get priority.  I'm unable to accept credit cards and, obviously, I will not be taking personal checks. I prefer cash but if a bank check or money order is preferable for you, I will accept that form of payment as long as I am present at the time it is drawn.  If you have any questions, please feel free to email me. Thank you and I hope everybody has a happy new year."

Not looking for profit; selling for less than what I paid for it. I just won't need it anytime soon, and they don't take returns.

It sports a set of custom VZ black G10 grips which, frankly, take the gun to a new level.  Original factory grips are included if you wish to revert to stock.  Comes with an extra 6-round magazine and the special order +1, 7-round magazine.  Tritium night sights.

Included is a Galco leather pocket holster, very good condition, as well as 75 rounds FMJ, and 70-ish rounds various premium defensive ammunition.

$875-$900 total retail value of all items, and I'm offering them together for $750 OBO.  If you just want the firearm and magazines, $650 OBO.  If you want anything from the package get in touch and maybe we can talk depending on demand for total package.  Would prefer not to separate.

This is probably the foremost concealable .380 auto pistol on the market, and is definitely for the discerning consumer.  Get in touch if you'd like to talk."

I purchased this shotgun a couple of years ago and have done several mods to it over the time I have owned it. I did have to send it off to Saiga's stateside factory to have it worked on shortly after I purchased it, due to it not feeding low brass reliably (it would jam). This was done while under warranty, and after I received it back, it feeds low brass (i.e. birdshot) pretty reliably now (it will hiccup on a rare basis). It NEVER has any issues w/ normal brass (i.e. buckshot or slugs). I installed the ""low brass reliability"" kit from 
Carolina Shooters Supply, which included an after-market gas plug/puc and 4 position gas knob. This shotgun can handle 2 3/4"" or 3"" shells. 

I have also converted the trigger/pistol group back to where it was supposed to be (on the receiver). This SIGNIFICANTLY shortens the gun, as I found it WAY too long before. I put a Tapco 6-position collapsible stock with a nice, thick rubber butt pad on it. The stock features a cheek riser and a sling attachment for right handed shooters (see pictures). I added a nice rubber Hogue grip as well. I installed a Vepr 12 magazine release, which allows for one handed magazine release. I installed a JTE magazine guide (i.e. the ""Rock-n-lock"") to allow for quicker magazine changes when using the 10 or 12 round SGM Tactical magazines. I also put a Chaos extended quad rail on this Saiga, in addition to a Tromix extended charging handle (makes the charging handle MUCH more comfortable when charging with your left hand). I also polished the bolt to increase smoothness and reliability. This gun is SMOOTH... you can come shoot to test yourself. 

Last but not least, I put Magpul's flip up front and rear sights on this shotgun. I also have a cheap NC Star red dot which actually does hold it's zero even under the 12 ga recoil. Comes with a MidwayUSA soft case and five 10-round SGM Tactical magazines. Call if interested... I am not interested in any trades. I am asking $2200 obo and am listing this other places. These will be hard to come by in the future so I am not negotiating much at this point.

Extended/Ported chokes can also be used to further reduce muzzle rise & felt recoil. Had planned on getting a full set of Ext/Ported tubes like I run in Citori, but did not get that far with this project.

Optional Accessories: (price listed is for gun & chokes in factory box)
Also have barrel band (for sling attachment in front of fore-grip), sling, Easyhit customized front rail sight (optic-dot appears only when gun properly mounted - both fast & accurate sighting with both eyes open http://easyhit-usa.com/), camo neoprene covers forend & butt-stock Beartooth 2.3mm neoprene).

Did a lot of research to find this youth shotgun; then spent longer finally getting my hands on one (then the time researching all the misc. accessories - over $100 parts alone). For a young shooter, it is excellent at reducing felt recoil and providing a simple & safe operation for field work. Gun has seen a couple boxes of lead at skeet range, and a few boxes in the field on pheasants, duck & geese (shoots 2-3/4"" lead, 3"" steel, 2-3/4"" & 3"" HeavyShot just fine). In excellent condition. I only wish I could have got my hands on this a couple years earlier as my 16-1/2 y.o. son is now ready for a full sized 12ga.

Also, have lots of quality youth gear (Neoprene Waders, Parkas, Shells, Boots, etc.) in sizes from Youth XS to XL & some Adult S - XL). Most everything is guide quality gear.

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” All models are available in standard military Gray."

I will not pay some ridiculous inflated price due to some ""assault ban"" and let me explain why. For one the only thing you need to do to make an ak47 legal is change the stock and put a low cap mag in. knowing this i also would recommend taking a second to think if you purchased an ak to make some fast cash off the ar ban what is going to happen if the bill doesn't pass? there will be tons of people that tried doing the same thing trying to sell off these rifles at msrp so then it will come to competitive pricing and you will lose money anyway thats what i want and thats what i'm offering price wise let me know if you have anything in that price range."
