The 800 series is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer. The 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger."

I bought this for my wife as a CCW, but we went to the range and she watched me shoot my 442 and said that she had no desire to shoot the 642 or start carrying it. So since I have a 442 I don't need this.

Price is $425.00 OBRO, but there isn't much wiggle room at all since that is what I have in it at dealer cost, and shipping.

The ONLY trade I would be interested in is a 3rd or 4th gen. Glock 19 or 26. I doubt I will find the trade tho because it would have to be straight across since I can buy Glocks brand new for $398.00 on my LE discount."

Comes with 2 mags, original box, and all that came with it. I received it in a trade and didn't care for the feel of it all that much. Has a generous estimate of 500 rounds through it, although I would not be surprised if it was closer to 300 based on its condition. 

The firearm is like new. The finish is near perfect except by the slide release from disassembly and a little on the barrel from slide movement. All internal parts are in excellent shape with little wear, if in need of a little cleaning. Disassembly is still very stiff from the like new parts. I have personally fired 14 rounds through it to test for function with no problems. It is also very accurate. At 50 Yards (we have no pistol range) 12 of the shots hit a 24-18"" paper. This was also the first time I had ever fired 1911 style pistol so your accuracy may be better.

It doesn't shoot fast enough to hurt anyone really, but you still need safety glasses. 

Also, this is not a walmart gun. Walmart guns are generally plasitc, low performance and cannot compete with real full metal airsoft guns. I've used this glock to win many games and it hasn't failed me yet. I've been the walmart route only to have it break with no parts to fix it. This gun is fairly common, so parts are easy to find and relitively cheap, so you get what you pay for so to speak.

I'll include 2 standard mags, battery and adapter w/smart charger and alligator clips. Price is firm.

I've maintained it with 50w silicone oil and kept it clean. It shoots at 200 fps with .20's. ROF is close to 1100 RPM

As mentioned, my wife is pregnant and I have a bill to pay.  Because of this, I am selling my Springfield Loaded .45 Caliber 1911 (Government 5"" slide length). 

This is a really nice gun.  I had a buddy that shot it, and he was surprised that it shot as well as his TRP!  I purchased it from a Boarder Patrol Agent and he had a reliability package done by Dick D'Vitorrio at East Orange Shooting Sports in Winter Park and the test target is included. 

There is over $1400 into this pistol!  It has the combat style sights, 3 magazines, a fit bushing, full length guide rod, a throated and crowned barrel and some awesome grips!  Oh, and the trigger job is awesome!  I think it's at 4 lbs or so.  I am asking 900.00 face to face, but will ship to an FFL that will accept from an individual for the cost of shipping-if I am allowed to do that...I'll have to check, never shipped a gun before.



The original grips, 2 pc guide rod, and bushing are included as well as 3 mags and test target."

For those unfamiliar with the Glock 27 GEN 4, it's Glock's newest compact .40 S&W caliber, improved action, spring, grips. Comes with original case, instructions, sealed fired first brass, glock reloader, 4 of the 9 round magazines (1 has the extra pinky extension), and two 15 round glock magazines. Truly is like new, no scuffs or scratches, literally cleaned after every trip to the range.  

This is a perfect pistol for everyday carry/concealed carry.  Small enough for a quality inside the waist band or tucked behind on the belt holster without printing, but with the .40 S&W, there is no doubt there is plenty of stopping power.  Fun to shoot, amazingly accurate, I hit the clothes pins that hold up paper targets off of the target range at Delaware Wild Life Area.  Great grips, comfortable, really a great gun.  

I'm in no hurry to sell, but entertaining trades right now or full price $500 asking price. Buy this lightly used gun with a bunch of extra magazines (believe me they can add up) all without paying the taxes or fees.

Ccw holders preferred, however must at least have Ohio drivers license and must not be prohibited from owning firearms, don't even try.

I am especially looking for a 1911 pistol in 45 acp. If you have any other interesting trades, firearms, enclosed trailers, tear drop camper, or anything of worth, let me know.

This is a really nice gun.  I had a buddy that shot it, and he was surprised that it shot as well as his TRP!  I purchased it from a Boarder Patrol Agent and he had a reliability package done by Dick D'Vitorrio at East Orange Shooting Sports in Winter Park and the test target is included. 

There is over $1400 into this pistol!  It has the combat style sights, 3 magazines, a fit bushing, full length guide rod, a throated and crowned barrel and some awesome grips!  Oh, and the trigger job is awesome!  I think it's at 4 lbs or so.  I am asking 900.00 face to face, but will ship to an FFL that will accept from an individual for the cost of shipping-if I am allowed to do that...I'll have to check, never shipped a gun before.

The -MOA T2 elevation adjustment includes a pre-engraved bullet drop compensation (BDC) dial to match the ballistics of most 55 grain .223 Remington/5.56mm NATO loads. Long range shooting solutions for the tactical hunter have never been easier. Is the target at 500 yards? Simply turn the dial to the ""5"" and squeeze the trigger. It's that easy. Whether you shoot an AR15 platform or a bolt action."

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

I didn't realize it was a 20 gauge reloader. I need a 12 gauge reloader. It is nearly new (other than the dust) and is complete with bottles. You can easily load shells for under $4 a box of 25.

I would prefer to trade it for a comparable loader in 12 gauge. 

These sell new for $150+ through Midway. These are some of the highest rated loaders for ease of use. I am asking $100 to offset the cost of another loader in 12 gauge if I don't trade it.

All the visible bolt components, including the cutoff switch, have an R on them indicating Remington parts like the rest of the rifle. There is also an R on the front muzzle band, front sight base, and the barrel is also remington and may be original. as it was made in 8-43. 

The parkerizing on the firearm is in near perfect shape no fading or noticable wear. The bluing on the bolt is a perfect black worn only from operating the action. The bolt face is the same. The peripheral parts, such as the barrel bands, floor plate, and end cap exhibit a little more wear. The barrel bands still retain most of their bluing with some combat scrapes present. 

Overall in excellent shape with only a couple of dings in the stock. There is very little wear present on the action. The metal finish is also nearly perfect with only a bit more wear on the peripherals such as the barrel bands. If I remember correctly it was made around 1943.

** This new scope mount has been designed to provide lower ""visual alignment"" mounting for scout scopes. Alloy steel cross bolt mounting to the rear sight base with a locking nut provides a secure installation and insures that this mount will not shoot loose.

The easily installed, ""no gunsmithing"" mount replaces the rear sight leaf. (Detailed installation instructions are included with the mount). Simply remove the rear sight leaf and leaf spring, then insert and bolt in the scout mount. Attach the included Weaver style rings to the Picatinny mount and install the extended eye relief (EER) scout scope. You can restore the rifle to its original configuration by unbolting the scope and mount and reinstalling the rear sight.

Some Mosin Nagant scope mounts were designed with two short bolts that attach through the side “ears” of the rear sight base and thread into the scope mount.  With extended shooting these bolts strip out the threads in the aluminum scope mount and the mount comes loose. Our mount has been threaded completely through and is fitted with a full length threaded alloy steel cross bolt and retaining nut that securely attaches the scope mount to the rear sight base.

This listing is for ONE pistol, the exact one in the photo. FFLS and police departments, however, may take any number of very similar CZ-70s at the same per-pistol price, and with no additional shipping charges. This pistol served and protected the good citizens of Ostrava, Czech Republic, with the Ostrava Municipal Police for the final years of the Cold War, with Soviet Interference, and during the first decade of a free Czech Republic. 1972 date code is stamped upper left side of slide, as the photos show, next to the Czech military proof mark. During the period of manufacture and issue the Czech Police were dealing with a good many Balkan terrorists; most important, however, was Vaclav Havel’s early underground leadership. Right side of slide is neatly stamped by the importer, PW Arms of Redmond, WA, as required by Federal Law. The CZ-70, or VZ-70 in Czech terminology, is a descendant of the Wartime CZ-27, very close kin in appearance, construction, and even quality to the Walther PPK/S. Left side slide bears CZ Factory Markings Vzor 70 cal. 7.65 / Made in Czechoslovakia. This fine little pistol is all steel, traditional double- and single-action with main lever safety and internal firing pin safety. The main safety serves as a decocker; yet the trigger-hammer system operates without firing while the safety is on, so the pistol will carry cocked and locked for single action first shot readiness and then stay ready for double action firing simply by raising the safety lever. Overall extreme length is 6 5/8 inches, from the muzzle to the back of the upper grip frame. Sight radius is 5 inches, with stake-on half moon low profile front sight separated from the dovetailed notch drift-adjustable-only rear sight by a very nicely serrated rib on top of the slide. Slide thickness is .868 inches; .925 if one measures the checkered serration disassembly bar on the right side of the frame. Lower rear area of the slide is serrated, as the photos show. Trigger is serrated face .312 width, with .295 serrated Commander / PPK Style hammer. Magazine capacity is 9 + 1 rounds of .32 ACP ammunition, 7.65 Browning in European terminology. Weight empty is a solid 23.8 ounces. Trigger pull is a manageable 15 pound vicinity on double action, and 7-8 pound range on single action. Grips are original issue polymer CZ with CZ factory logo, Czeska Zbrojovka, logo on the right panel. Barrel is 3 1/2 inch with 1:10 conventional rifling. This is one of the easiest pistols ever to field strip and clean, by means of the slide release button on the slide, even simpler than their PPK relatives. Surface detractions are moderate, with substantial amounts of original bluing mixed with holster contact and carry scouring. We rate this CZ-70 as Good, 60 to 70 percent vicinity by our estimate; photos, however, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. It is Excellent Mechanically; Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent on this pistol. Replacement pricing on current production CZ-USA Pistols is always $400 - $ 500 range. We’re offering the CZ 70 in the photos, however, for only $ 169.00.	Not transferable to civilians in California, District of Colombia,  Massachusetts, or New York City.	Not C&R Eligible.	We are in stock on plenty of .32 ACP Ammo, 30 cents a round / $15 per 50 box price area.

The scope. mount and illuminator are still available for $500.

This semi-auto is chambered for .223/5.56, 16"" barrel, has a DPMS lower receiver, 6 position stock, a Yukon 2.5 NVRS GEN 1 2.5x50 night vision scope, additional Yukon IR illuminator, four 30 round AR Stoner magazines and the scope cover.

This gun has less than 20 rounds through it since new. 

The scope is new and has not been zeroed-in since put on the rifle.

I added the extra illuminator to increase the night vision range. (the scope has an illumintator build in that is half the power of the one I added)

If you have never tried one of these night vision scopes, they are pretty impressive. In the timber where I live, you can see also like it was day light up to about 75 yards. If there is moon light much farther.

After I put this package together a friend needed to sell his GEN 2 set-up rather cheap and I don't need two.

My loss, your gain.

I really like the look of the equinox and I enjoy shooting .45. 
I am in the process of figuring out what I need to obtain in order to purchase a handgun, so I don't have my cpl/ccw or anything yet and don't plan to be able to buy anything until I do, but I figured I would post something and maybe by the time I find one in my price range I will have all of that settled. 

Would like it to have case, manual, extra mags(not necessary though) and to be in 9.5-10/10 condition, of course. 

Price range is $700-800, I know its a little low for what the gun is, but thats all I am willing to spend.

Thank you and I look forward to finding the right gun.

The reason that I'm selling it is because it turns out that I'm not as in to pistols as I thought that I would be. 

The gun has some wear on the front of the slide, the slide release and the barrel itself. Also, the night sights are worn out and there is a very small chip in the glass on the front sight.  In spite of these cosmetic issues, the gun shoots just fine. I pretty sure the gun also has an extended slide release.

I suspect that this gun has fired quite a few rounds based on the wear on the barrel.  I've put about 300 through it while I owned it without any issues.

Gun comes with 3 fifteen round magazines.

This listing is for ONE pistol, the exact one in the photo. FFLs and Police Departments, however, may take any number of very similar pistols at the same per-gun price, and with no additional shipping charges. This pistol served and protected the good citizens of Ostrava, Czech Republic, with the Ostrava Municipal Police for the final years of the Cold War, with Soviet Interference, and during the first decade of a free Czech Republic. 1971 date code is stamped upper left side of slide, as the photos show, next to the Czech military proof mark. During the period of manufacture and issue the Czech Police were dealing with a good many Balkan terrorists; most important, however, was Vaclav Havel’s early underground leadership. Right side of slide is neatly stamped by the importer, PW Arms of Redmond, WA, as required by Federal Law. The CZ-70, or VZ-70 in Czech terminology, is a descendant of the Wartime CZ-27, very close kin in appearance, construction, and even quality to the Walther PPK/S. Left side slide bears CZ Factory Markings Vzor 70 cal. 7.65 / Made in Czechoslovakia. This fine little pistol is all steel, traditional double- and single-action with main lever safety and internal firing pin safety. The main safety serves as a decocker; yet the trigger-hammer system operates without firing while the safety is on, so the pistol will carry cocked and locked for single action first shot readiness and then stay ready for double action firing simply by raising the safety lever. Overall extreme length is 6 5/8 inches, from the muzzle to the back of the upper grip frame. Sight radius is 5 inches, with stake-on half moon low profile front sight separated from the dovetailed notch drift-adjustable-only rear sight by a very nicely serrated rib on top of the slide. Slide thickness is .868 inches; .925 if one measures the checkered serration disassembly bar on the right side of the frame. Lower rear area of the slide is serrated, as the photos show. Trigger is serrated face .312 width, with .295 serrated Commander / PPK Style hammer. Magazine capacity is 9 + 1 rounds of .32 ACP ammunition, 7.65 Browning in European terminology. Weight empty is a solid 23.8 ounces. Trigger pull is a manageable 15 pound vicinity on double action, and 7-8 pound range on single action. Grips are original issue polymer CZ with CZ factory logo, Czeska Zbrojovka, logo on the right panel. Barrel is 3 1/2 inch with 1:10 conventional rifling. This is one of the easiest pistols ever to field strip and clean, by means of the slide release button on the slide, even simpler than their PPK relatives. Surface detractions are moderate, with substantial amounts of original bluing mixed with holster contact and carry scouring. We rate this CZ-70 as Good, 60 to 70 percent vicinity by our estimate; photos, however, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. It is Excellent Mechanically; Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent on this pistol. Replacement pricing on current production CZ-USA Pistols is always $400 - $ 500 range.

Buyer will receive the exact pistol in the photo; FFLs and Police Depts however may take any number of similar pistols at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges. 1973 date code is stamped upper left side of slide, as the photos show, next to the Czech military proof mark. During the period of manufacture and issue the Czech Police were dealing with a good many Balkan terrorists; most important, however, was Vaclav Havel’s early underground leadership. Right side of slide is neatly stamped by the importer, PW Arms of Redmond, WA, as required by Federal Law. The CZ-70, or VZ-70 in Czech terminology, is a descendant of the Wartime CZ-27, very close kin in appearance, construction, and even quality to the Walther PPK/S. Left side slide bears CZ Factory Markings Vzor 70 cal. 7.65 / Made in Czechoslovakia. This fine little pistol is all steel, traditional double- and single-action with main lever safety and internal firing pin safety. The main safety serves as a decocker; yet the trigger-hammer system operates without firing while the safety is on, so the pistol will carry cocked and locked for single action first shot readiness and then stay ready for double action firing simply by raising the safety lever. Overall extreme length is 6 5/8 inches, from the muzzle to the back of the upper grip frame. Sight radius is 5 inches, with stake-on half moon low profile front sight separated from the dovetailed notch drift-adjustable-only rear sight by a very nicely serrated rib on top of the slide. Slide thickness is .868 inches; .925 if one measures the checkered serration disassembly bar on the right side of the frame. Lower rear area of the slide is serrated, as the photos show. Trigger is serrated face .312 width, with .295 serrated Commander / PPK Style hammer. Magazine capacity is 9 + 1 rounds of .32 ACP ammunition, 7.65 Browning in European terminology. Weight empty is a solid 23.8 ounces. Trigger pull is a manageable 15 pound vicinity on double action, and 7-8 pound range on single action. Grips are original issue polymer CZ with CZ factory logo, Czeska Zbrojovka, logo on the right panel. Barrel is 3 1/2 inch with 1:10 conventional rifling. This is one of the easiest pistols ever to field strip and clean, by means of the slide release button on the slide, even simpler than their PPK relatives. Surface detractions are moderate, with strong original bluing affected by faint edge and side whitening, and occasional finish freckling. We rate this CZ-70 as Very Good, 80 percent vicinity by our estimate; photos, however, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. It is Excellent Mechanically; Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent on this pistol. Replacement pricing on current production CZ-USA Pistols is always $400 - $ 500 range.

This listing is for ONE pistol, the exact one in the photo. This pistol served and protected the good citizens of Ostrava, Czech Republic, with the Ostrava Municipal Police for the final years of the Cold War, with Soviet Interference, and during the first decade of a free Czech Republic. 1973 date code is stamped upper left side of slide, as the photos show, next to the Czech military proof mark. During the period of manufacture and issue the Czech Police were dealing with a good many Balkan terrorists; most important, however, was Vaclav Havel’s early underground leadership. Right side of slide is neatly stamped by the importer, PW Arms of Redmond, WA, as required by Federal Law. The CZ-70, or VZ-70 in Czech terminology, is a descendant of the Wartime CZ-27, very close kin in appearance, construction, and even quality to the Walther PPK/S. Left side slide bears CZ Factory Markings Vzor 70 cal. 7.65 / Made in Czechoslovakia. This fine little pistol is all steel, traditional double- and single-action with main lever safety and internal firing pin safety. The main safety serves as a decocker; yet the trigger-hammer system operates without firing while the safety is on, so the pistol will carry cocked and locked for single action first shot readiness and then stay ready for double action firing simply by raising the safety lever. Overall extreme length is 6 5/8 inches, from the muzzle to the back of the upper grip frame. Sight radius is 5 inches, with stake-on half moon low profile front sight separated from the dovetailed notch drift-adjustable-only rear sight by a very nicely serrated rib on top of the slide. Slide thickness is .868 inches; .925 if one measures the checkered serration disassembly bar on the right side of the frame. Lower rear area of the slide is serrated, as the photos show. Trigger is serrated face .312 width, with .295 serrated Commander / PPK Style hammer. Magazine capacity is 9 + 1 rounds of .32 ACP ammunition, 7.65 Browning in European terminology. Weight empty is a solid 23.8 ounces. Trigger pull is a manageable 15 pound vicinity on double action, and 7-8 pound range on single action. Grips are original issue polymer CZ with CZ factory logo, Czeska Zbrojovka, logo on the right panel. Barrel is 3 1/2 inch with 1:10 conventional rifling. This is one of the easiest pistols ever to field strip and clean, by means of the slide release button on the slide, even simpler than their PPK relatives. Surface detractions are moderate, with substantial amounts of original bluing mixed with holster contact and carry scouring. We rate this CZ-70 as Good, 60 to 70 percent vicinity by our estimate; photos, however, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves.
