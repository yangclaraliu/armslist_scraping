Summary: Any rifle with the ability to accept a detachable magazine can not have a single feature to include pistol grips, vertical foregrips, folding/collapsing stocks, muzzle brake etc.

Shotgun mags are capped at 7 rounds and are subject to the same rules as rifles.

The magazine limit has been reduced to 7 rounds, making 10 rounders illegal in one year's time. This forces NY residents to sell their 10 round magazines out of state or be in violation of the law. Consider what this means for many popular handguns that do not have 7 round magazines available.... 

I know a lot of silliness has been posted on here lately but this is not speculation, this is not rumor, this is now NY state law. It may possibly be a sign of what's to come. Please don't take my word for it, read about it yourselves.

The TEC-9 is made of inexpensive molded polymers and stamped steel parts. Magazines with 10-, 20-, 32-, 50-rounds are made.

The ballistics on the Remington .30 AR caliber give this gun big game knock down power to 400 yards according to experts.  It is a great semi-auto for hog hunting!

The gun is camo dipped from the factory.  The gun will come with one 4 round magazine, as from factory.  Factory paper work and case included.   The gun and the ammunition with both work with 10 and 20 round P-mags.   Note:  The lower is compatible with 223 and or 5.56 uppers.    The lower is labeled as ""multi caliber"". 

The  BSA red dot scope on the gun can be included for an extra $50.00.  
The bipod is not for sale.

In the current times a gun is useless without a supply of ammunition.  I have 220 rounds (11 boxes) that will come with the gun.  Remember this set up is designed for hunting.   The asking price with ammo is $1600.00

Do a little research on the caliber and the gun.  It should be pointed out that in spite of some forum posts to the contrary,  Remington is still manufacturing the ammunition for this gun.  I verified this with Remington's Lonoke ammunition plant in Loanoke, Arkansas earlier this month."

The results are astounding – with very serious implications for every coyote, fox or bobcat that crosses its path.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace."

If you want to trade something we will work out shipping and what not for someone who is serious about trading.  No lowball offers I don't have to move this stuff but I would like to. The picture isn't exact, but if you want more pictures I can send them"

The Bad: 

80% complete, 10 foot paint job that the sun has faded on the hood and trunk, rear gear needs to be backlashed (1 hour job if you know what you doing), top is not factory black which is in awesome shape but requires in to be dyed twice a year if parked outdoors, interior is in the process of all black conversion and has factory white seats, stereo is not installed however I have a sony CD player new in the box.

The Good:

True 84,xxx mile car with the rest of the drivetrain having less than 3,000 miles on it. New black carpet and white face gauges in dash and A pillar.

Body: Sunset orange in color, Kaenaan 3.5 inch cowl hood, Saleen wing, 93 Cobra tailights and front bumper, 8000k HID headlights, 17 inch Saleen rims with brand new tires.

Engine: Chrome Mac shorty headers, cold air intake, Ford Motorsports wires, underdrive pullies, 100 shot NOS wet kit (switches pulled out for interior conversion). 

Transmission: new Ram HDX clutch, adjustable cable and quadrant, Hurst short throw with stops, new Cobra spec 3.35 transmission.

Rearend: New bearing and seals, Ford Motor sport 3.27 gears, Motorsport 31 spline carrier with carbon fiber clutches (same as 2003 Cobra) Yukon hardenend 31 spline axles.

Suspension: Eibach Sportline springs, subframe connectors, box tube rear control arms with polyurethane bushings, Mac strut tower brace, poly upper axle housing bushings. 

Exhaust: Mac headers, 2 1/2 in X pipe, two chamber Flowmaster's with 3 in tails turned down under bumper like a factory GT.

There are many other small parts that are new that im sure im leaving out. ALL parts above except the NOS kit, strut tower brace and tailight were purchased new by me from either late model restoration or Harris Mustang in Charlotte. 

Price is negotiable but however im not hurting to sell this car. I have just lost interest and time not to mention not having a garage sucks. 

If your in the market for a 5.0 vert and looking for a solid start then this car is worth a look.

$3500 firm. 

May consider partial trades for originally priced assault type rifles and higher end pistols. Im only interested in Glocks, 1911, etc as far as pistols. I have about $8500 in this car which im going to loose big however your guns are worth more now than what you probably paid. Just keep that in mind. I am considering fair market value on your guns not what you paid. 

Call or text Tim at REDACTED. 

Im looking for any type of assault weapon, (Ar-15, M4, Ak-47, AMD-65, mini 14, H&K, FAL, FN, Macs, Tecs, Tactical Shotguns, bulk ammo - 9mm, .223, 7.62x39, 40sw and 45ACP) If it fell under the 1994-2004 assault weapon ban than Im probably interested.

They are true USGI magazines but not just any USGI magazines. These were made by Okay Industries and Center Industries, both are leaders in M16/AR15 magazine Manufacturing for our military.


Complete Magazines are $20.00 each and the magazine bodies are $15.00 each and the magazine bodies come with new green followers.

Complete magazine rebuild kits can be found on the cdnninvestments website. $10.00 a for a 3 pack.

I am firm on the price because no matter where you go everyone is asking $30.00 or more per magazine. You will not find these any cheaper

The Grip Pod System is a revolutionary new vertical fore-grip integrated with a strong and stable bipod. The Grip Pod's legs deploy at the push of a button - instantly! Made from advanced, reinforced polymers, the Grip Pod is light to preserve weapon balance, and tough to withstand hard use. Steel reinforced legs, passes military drop test. The Grip Pod is the ultimate improvement to any weapon system currently employing a vertical grip. The Grip Pod offers a combination of advantages never before available in a single accessory. This is an enhanced target acquisition system (ETAS). Using the Grip Pod an operator can go from a standing or kneeling position to a prone position, and have a stable base for aimed firing in place before hitting the ground. Say goodbye to cumbersome bipods that have to be manually clipped on or folded into position. The Grip Pod is manufactured from aerospace materials to exceed military specifications for construction and finish. It mounts directly to rail systems.  The Grip Pod is currently in worldwide use with select Special Forces units including: US Navy Seals and EOD, US Army, US Army Special Forces and Designated Marksmen, Secret Security, USMC, US SOCOM, FBI HRT, and unmentionable government entities."

995,http://www.armslist.com/posts/857995,For Sale:   USED 8 Metal AR-15 magazines. SOLD OUT,"Austintown, Ohio, United States",$ 50,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 15, 2013",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I had found seven 30 round AR-15 mags in a bottom of my many gear crates. Since I sold my AR-15 for the AK platform, I no longer need them. The 20 round magazines was found as well. The finish on seven of them were worn on the outside more than I would have liked before I sold them. I sanded the seven 30 round magazines and put two light coats of Flat Black Rust-Oleum enamel on them to put a clean finish on them. The paint is not perfect but they look a lot better. The magazines will make good cheap training mags that will do the job or a person can give them a full rebuild.  All magazines work fully and they have never caused me a problem. I am asking for $50 for all the mags and shipping of the person’s choice UPS, Fedex or USPS.  I am asking what I feel is a fair price for the mags far cheaper than the many others have been selling. I would prefer to sell it as a set since I do not have a lot of spare time to make many trips to mail them off. UPS, Fedex and USPS will both include tracking numbers. Thanks for your time and God Bless."
