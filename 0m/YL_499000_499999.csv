It's like new in box. Comes with the original box, all original paperwork, and one magazine. I even have a box of .25 ammo I'd include. It's a stainless model with simulated pearl grips.

I was the first person to fire a round through it. I've fired one magazine = 6 shots I believe.. The very first shot, the grip on the left side cracked, but it looks to be easily repairable. It's a small crack right at the grip screw. I hear it was a common thing with these pistols. There's a set of grips on Ebay for cheap, if a person wanted to go that route.

This is a very collectible pistol. You just don't see them become available very often. It's an exact copy of the legendary Baby Browning. It would make an excellent purse gun for someones wife, or a pocket pistol to carry around your property, as it's very small.

The Nagant M1895 Revolver is a seven-shot, gas-seal revolver designed and produced by Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant for the Russian Empire. The Nagant M1895 was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, 7.62x38R, and featured an unusual ""gas-seal"" system, in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile and allowing the weapon to be suppressed (an unusual ability for a revolver)."

As you can see, the anodized finish on the alloy receiver is mostly worn off, but the bluing on the barrel and cylinder is in pretty god shape still. What you can't see, and the reason it is so cheap, is that there are issues with the trigger. When fired, the trigger does not completely reset. You have to pull the hammer back a little to get it to reset. So it works fine as a single-action, but not double. It was like this when I bought it; I tore it apart, tried to figure out the problem, put it back together, and it still doesn't work quite right. It is actually a very accurate little revolver. I wanted it to carry in my truck and use while trapping, but I'm just looking to get my money back out of it now. I'd like $75, or maybe trade for something below. I am located about an hour north of Indy."

This is the Wilkinson Arms Terry 9mm Carbine.  Based on an original design from J&R Engineering called the M68, this was a limited production run from a Mom & Pop style firearm manufacturer that placed too much emphasis on perfection and quality that subsequently put them out of business.

The Terry carbine is chambered in 9mm and is a pistol caliber carbine.  Although it has the legal barrel length of 16in, several inches of the barrel reside in the receiver to give an extremely compact tactical package.   As you can see from the pictures, the barrel removed from the receiver by simply unscrewing a washer which then breaks the gun down into an extremely small and concealable package.

This gun takes 31 round magazines and feeds in the same manor of an Uzi.  This gun will outshoot an UZI all day long with accuracy and reliability.  Essentially, this is the American Uzi that never made it mainstream.  The upper part of the receiver is formed so that a simple claw scope mount can be mounted and optics utilized.  I can personally attest that of the 3 times I have shot this rifle, I had no problem hitting a man size metal target from 100-150yrds.

Wilkinson Arms also manufactured a much more common variant of this gun in pistol form known as the Linda.  This particular example would rate in the 90-95% condition range and comes with 2 31 round magazines. 
The stock is in BEAUTIFUL shape and the entire rifle looks great and functions fantastically.

I had plans to keep this locked in the safe but a new interest in competition shooting forces me to sell to fund my next project.

The Gen 3 GLOCK 19 is a compact 9mm that can double as a duty or concealed carry pistol.  Many who carry a pistol everyday will tell you that  if they can only have one, it would be a G19.  The compact size GLOCK pistols really hit the sweet spot of being easy to shoot while being quite concealable with the proper holster and apparel.  If you are looking to concentrate on one platform to train with and carry, the G19 is hard to beat.

GLOCK revolutionized the handgun market with the debut of their polymer frame safe action semi-auto pistols in 1982.  To this day, GLOCK is the brand that all other polymer pistols are judged by.  For most of GLOCK's product life you could have it any way you wanted as long as it was black.  There were some OD Green frame Gen 3 guns produced for several years, but they have been discontinued since mid 2010.  Now you have a choice of having your GLOCK with a Flat Dark Earth frame exclusively through Lipsey's.  Flat Dark Earth has been the popular color to have for AR-15 parts and accessories, holsters, and all sorts of tactical gear.

Very hard to find, and not currently produced or available. Increasing in value and scarcity every day.  Includes clam shell factory case, cable lock, loading tool, (3) factory Glock 15-round magazines, and all original paperwork.  Brand new, un-fired.

Located in Spartanburg. Price is firm, not looking for trades, barters or swaps.  Please email for details or questions."

This particular one was made at the Izhevsk arsenal in 1937 which makes it any early version of a round reciever. The machining is very nice on this example. It comes with the sling pictured as well as a bayonet and oil bottle. I would be willing to trade it for a nice .22, .22 Mag, or .17 HMR rifle. Also a nice pump action .410, 20 or 12 gauge shotgun. Trade only, thanks."
