Some of the metal adornments on the holster are green (copper oxidation?) and one is missing.  Leather holster is stamped, D.R.G.M and A.K. (Albrecht Kind, GMBH) with logo.

There are 3 Crown ""N"" proof marks that I found.  The one on the end of the barrel is a bit faint but still legible.

I believe the PPK was made in 1935 due to serial number 881362.  My uncle brought it back from Germany after his tour of WWII duty.  Some of the metal adornments on the holster are green (copper oxidation?) and one is missing.  Leather holster is stamped, D.R.G.M and A.K. (Albrecht Kind, GMBH) with logo.  

The rare brown grip has a fine age related stress crack near the top as seen in the pictures.  It also has the matching brown finger grip magazine and a spare in the holster.  There are 3 Crown ""N"" proof marks that I found.  The one on the end of the barrel is a bit faint but still legible.  This Walther is in the same condition that I inherited it 20 years ago (ie. it has not been cleaned, fired or otherwise adulterated).  This Walther can be shipped to an FFL in the US only, but I prefer a simple FTF cash offer.

I believe the PPK was made in 1935 due to serial number 881362.  My uncle brought it back from Germany after his tour of WWII duty.  Some of the metal adornments on the holster are green (copper oxidation?) and one is missing.  Leather holster is stamped, D.R.G.M and A.K. (Albrecht Kind, GMBH) with logo.  

The rare brown grip has a fine age related stress crack near the top as seen in the pictures.  It also has the matching brown finger grip magazine and a spare in the holster.  There are 3 Crown ""N"" proof marks that I found.  The one on the end of the barrel is a bit faint but still legible.  This Walther is in the same condition that I inherited it 20 years ago (ie. it has not been cleaned, fired or otherwise adulterated).  This Walther can be shipped to an FFL in the US only, but I prefer a simple FTF cash offer.

If your trade is worth less than mine I would expect cash my way or if yours is worth more than mine I may be able to throw some cash or I may have another gun or shotgun I could throw in to make it even. Please no BS offers, don't waste my time and I won't waste yours. Not looking for cash offers at this time but I will NOT take less than $800 cash for everything I have listed but like I said trades of my preference have first shot. Must be FTF and prefer licensed concealed carry persons with ID. I will also require a bill of sale with printed name and address and signature only for proof in my records that I sold/traded my gun because mine is registered in my name. I have several pictures I can send via email or through picture message on my cell other than the ones I have on here. Please contact me through add on here and we can exchange numbers or other info from there.

This rifle isn't for everyone. 1) It's a bolt action 2) Since only 2500 were imported in '96,  these are extremely rare to find.  And even harder to find in condition.  I've been lurking board all over the net,  and generally 1 goes for sale on the web, maybe 3-4 times a year.  Most people, that have these loves them because they love how well they perform compared to much more expensive rifle like Anschutz and Kimber's.

The rifle is still in very good condition, but will need to be cleaned because it hasn't been shot in 5+ years!  They are a few small nick in the wood stock.

The rifle originally included 1 magazine , but I have bought 3 extras mags since it is only a 5 round mag.

 i will consider all cash offers. i do not have pics at this time. but more than happy to meet up with a serious buyer.just have alot of honeys do that need to get done and not enough cash to finish them. 

 so make some offers.  i might consider possible gun trades. plus cash..

 my mistake. in wording. i will not sale this shotgun for 1000.00....  this gun is clean. but when i made the post it required me to put a price in. a thousand was a begining price. i have 12 emails with people wanting it for 1000.00  so i am clarifing, make offer.  or i will take 2000.00 cash on an outright buy price. i have no interest in mailing the shotgun. i do not want to deal with the transactions fee nor hassles.  this is a my hand to your hand deal."

Already, the Light for Life® UC3.400 has received outstanding reviews from law enforcement and tech gadget experts, including Wired.com, Yahoo! Tech and Police Equipment Reviews for its innovation, high power and durability. Now, we have made it even better ensuring the ultimate quality and performance you expect from 5.11. 



Light for Life® Flashlight UC3.400 Product Description: 

LENGTH - 11.5 in, 29.2 cm 
BARREL DIAMETER - 1 3/4 in, 4.5 cm 
HEAD DIAMETER (AT WIDEST POINT) - 2.75 in, 7 cm 
WEIGHT - Approx. 16oz. 
Made of durable polymer. 
Impact, abrasion, and water resistant 
Recharges in 90 Seconds. 
Run time = 120 minutes 
Contains 3 LED’s rated for more than 50,000 hours. 
Box Dimensions will be 13” x 8” x 4” 
Comes with 12 Volt DC Charger, AC Adapter, Plastic Belt Ring with Nylon Strap, and a mounting bracket. 
5.11 Tactical has entered into a partnership with IVUS Energy Innovations, the makers of Flashpoint™ Power Technology, to bring you a flashlight that will revolutionize the portable lighting category and be true to our brand and our customers. The UC3.400 provides the longest uptime, the fastest recharge on the market,it is environmentally friendly, and you will never need to replace your flashlight. 

In only 90 seconds, the UC3.400 Flashlight will go from dead flat to a full charge. This quick recharge allows the light to always be ready. No need to carry multiple flashlights, purchase multiple chargers, or have to remember to charge your light after a long shift. In just 90 seconds, your Light for Life® UC3.400 will be fully charged and ready to produce another 120 minutes of light. Whereas most flashlights begin to lose strength after you initially turn them on, the Light for Life® last for 60 minutes at 90 lumens, cycling down to 25 lumens for 30 minutes and finally 15 lumens for 30 minutes. This keeps you safe in the toughest of conditions. 

Unlike traditional rechargeable battery systems that develop memory or degrade (holding less and less charge after each use) and have a life expectancy of 500 – 1000 charge/discharge cycles, the Flashpoint™ Power Technology system is rated for 50,000 charge/discharge cycles with virtually no degradation. That’s a charge a day for more than 135 years! Through 50,000 cycles, our testing shows that the Flashpoint™ system will still retain 96% of its peak capacity. Powered by 3 LED’s rated for more than 50,000 hours (that's 40 hours a week, for more than 24 years) means that there is nothing to replace. The Light for Life® can supply your lighting needs for years to come. 

The 5.11 Light for Life® comes with a limited lifetime warranty and its internal components are rated for a life of over 50,000 cycles. That adds up to more than 130 years if you use and recharge the light once a day! The flashlight’s body is made from a rugged and durable polymer that is impact, abrasion and water resistant to stand up to the intense duty we know you’ll put it through. 

Light in picture is a stock image of the same light I have for sale. Mine is used with minor scratches but functioning perfectly with very few cycles."

I lowered the prices to $425 for just the rifle & all accessories with 2 boxes of ammo, or $500 for it with the scope.  If I still have it next weekend, I'm going to put the rifle on Gunbroker & ebay the scope.  That scope on ebay brings $120+ & the rifle is an easy $450.  I don't like messing with shipping things, but I can charge for it on that venue.  That being said:

I have a Like new with box & all paperwork, including hang tags & factory scope mount card, Savage 340e in 22 Hornet.  This rifle is in pristine condition.  There is not a scratch, ding, dent, speck or flake on it.  It hasn't been drilled, filled, beaten, used or abused.  It is perfect.  I shot it last weekend & was getting consistent ragged one hole patterns at 25-100 yards shooting a factory loaded Hornady 35gr. V-max.  It has a 24"" barrel (not the common 22"")  a genuine walnut stock, folding rear sight & one magazine.  I don't particularly WANT to sell it, but I need some spare cash for a project & this is the latest gun I bought & don't have a lot of sentimental attachment to it, yet.  It is a BEAUTIFUL rifle & not someones kicked around truck gun.  Price is $550.  I am really not interested in trades unless they involve mostly cash.  Also included is 2 boxes of Hornady 35gr. V-max bullets.  I only regret buying it because I can't afford to buy a single stage press & reloading equipment & dies.  Call or text REDACTED  If you are reading this, it is still for sale.  Thanks for looking.

I added better pictures & updated the price.  The only 2 of these on gunbroker in the last 6 months sold at the buy-it-now option within a few minutes of the auction going live, at very high prices.  They were also quite rough.  The target is from 75 yards & the 15 shot group was fired as fast as I could work the bolt & recenter & reload.  It's sighted at 50 yards, and the target was vertical, not horizontal."

In fact for the past 5 years it has been exclusively a safe queen.  Taken out to fondle or clean but that is all. I do not wish to own it any longer and would prefer that some one who will shoot and enjoy it have it.  The firearm functions very well and is comfortable to shoot or carry.

The Ultra RCP is Kimber's ultimate concealed carry pistol. This is the older version with black grips and external extractor. This pistol has no traditional sights but rather a trench the user aims through. You can be surprisingly accurate with this little pistol despite its lack of traditional sights.

There is a small scratch on the frame visible in one of the pictures I posted. This is the only damage or blemish on this pistol and does not impair its function.

The trigger group was moved forward.  The ACE stock, also from Carolina, with the push button hinge was a total of 200 bucks.  The pistol grip, the forearm grip and the vertical grip were $125 from Carolina as well.  Last is the 10 round 2nd generation mag from AGP.  They make the best mags and it was 40 bucks.

This is an M44, not the 91/30 you see in Big 5.  It is just about 41 inches long, making it a handy, light, and practical hunting rifle.  Almost no retailers have M44's in stock anymore, as the supply (at least what we seem to be able to get to) seems to have dried up in Europe.

Mainstay of the Russian army through two world wars and the Bolshevik Revolution.

Arsenal rebuilt by the Russians after WWII to battle issue ready specs and then put in long term storage waiting on WWIII.  Will clean up to be a good looking example of type, and should be a good shooter to boot!

$100 +Tax for round receiver rifle, upgrades to HEX receivers available at additional cost, as well as Ex-Dragoons.

These rifles are in really wonderful condition, good furniture, arsenal rebuilt prior to storage.  Clean off/out the cosmoline and you're ready to go!
