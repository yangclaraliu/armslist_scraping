Walther PPS is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses modified Browning type locking with tilting barrel. Frame of the gun is made from impact resistant polymer. Trigger is of double action only type, striker fired, with pre-cocked striker system, similar to QA system used in Walther P99 pistols. This system requires a manual recocking (by partial slide retraction) in the case of misfire. Gun is fitted with automated trigger safety and firing pin block; additional ""storage type"" safety is provided by removable backstrap of the grip; once backstrap is removed, the firing pin is automatically decocked and gun is blocked until the backstrap is reinstalled. This patented system is called QuickSafe by Walther. Sights are low profile, with rear sight adjustable for windage."

This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. We have attached a Trijicon ACOG 4x32 TA01NSN and a Promag vertical Grip and Adapter. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. Trijicon 4x32 ACOG 4x32 Scope TA01NSN w/ Amber Center Illumination for M4A1 fits the AR15/M16 flat-top rifles. Modifications to this Trijicon Special Forces TA01 NSNimage model include an integral rear ghost ring aperture and a tritium glow-in-the-dark front sight(Amber Illumination) for close-combat/back-up sighting, and includes Flat Top Adapter, Backup Iron Sights and Dust Cover. TA01NSN Trijicon ACOG 4x32 sight was designed specifically for the US Special Operations Command SOPMOD M4 Carbine ** WHY BUY FROM ON TARGET? WE MAKE IT EASY.

The simple design of the P6 braided recoil spring allowed Sig Sauer to produce a more compact pistol with the same durability as a full-sized pistol without increasing production costs and pricing out the average consumer. The trigger on the P6 is slightly heavier than the pull on the civilian 225. Its handle is slim, making the P6 easy to grip and conceal. This German made and import-stamped double-action pistol features a synthetic grip, a decocking lever, and fixed 2-dot sights and includes an 8-round magazines, a holster, and the original factory box.

Anyone desiring to purchase a firearm must be able to pass a background check. There are age limits on the sale of certain items. And certain types of items are illegal in certain places - for example 'assault weapons' cannot be sold in California. The NRA also has put together a terrific NRA guide to state-by-state gun laws. The ATF has compiled information on the various state laws; click here to view the ATF state-by-state gun laws information. Again, it is your responsibility to make sure that you comply with the laws of your country, city, and state.

You do not have to be a licensed dealer to buy a firearm. If you are not a licensed dealer (also called an FFL Holder), you must make arrangements with an FFL holder in your state to receive the item and transfer it to you. The FFL holder will typically charge a nominal fee for providing this service. In addition to the fees listed, the FFL holder may be required by law to collect sales tax, background check fees, or other transfer-related fees."

For sale is a nice condition 1937 8 mm Mauser. It is an exceptional quality, pre-war build of the Czechoslovakian VZ-24 and was made at the BRNO factory. All numbers match. The rifle has been sporterized with a turned bolt handle rather than straight, and a nice fitting and finish sport stock. There is some corrosion on the floor plate, which is pretty hard to avoid on the Mausers. Overall bluing is very good with a light patina developing in some places. 

It is an excellent shooter. I’ve put a few hundred rounds through it shooting silhouettes at 100-300 meters with open sights. This is a quality 1937 rifle.

Here are a few of the questions we have designed the Defensive Pistol course curriculum to specifically address: 

• Do I know what type of people commit crimes, how they commit them, who they commit them against, and how to spot tell-tale signs of a crime about to happen? 
•Is my pistol a defensive tool I know how to competently operate, or am I merely expecting its mere presence and noise when fired to stop an attack? 
•Am I a good enough shot to consistently hit what I'm aiming at without endangering those around me? 
•What if one or two shots aren't enough to stop an assailant? What if ten shots isn't enough? 


COURSE OVERVIEW: 

Defensive Pistol 1 is one full day of training including lecture, practical exercises, and live fire on the range. Many courses are focused on the needs of law enforcement and military. This pistol-focused class is designed for people who want to acquire real-world defensive pistol skill sets designed specifically for civilian carry.


YOU WILL LEARN: 

•How to select an appropriate firearm 
•How to manipulate your firearm as a defensive tool 
•How to shoot accurately and consistently and how to speed up consistent accuracy 
•Quickly clearing malfunctions when your firearm experiences them 

YOU WILL NEED: 

•A semi-automatic pistol and at least 2 magazines 
•200 rounds of ammunition
•Ear and eye protection 
•A folding camp chair for your comfort 
•Money for lunch/bring your lunch 
•Proper attire for the weather and conditions 
•A hat and/or sunscreen is advisable 

***Please Note: all below equipment is available for rental/purchase as needed - try before you buy! Don't let a lack of gear stop you from taking this class!!!***

In self-defense, we only get one chance to do it right: the first time. We need to find out the realities of self-defense in a safe, controlled training environment where we get a ""do-over"" when our preparations or equipment fails. We do NOT want to find out what doesn't work in a dirty mall parking lot where failure means serious bodily harm or even death; we would much rather discover those deficiencies in our preparation and equipment in training so we won't have to fail when it matters! 

You will never be set up to fail in this course. Our staff is certified, friendly, competent, proficient, fun, and professional. This course is designed to improve you from the very first moment you step in our door, starting from any skill level, with your own equipment, because the edge that you acquire from training will translate to a life-saving difference when it matters most. Pay attention in class, apply what you learn, and you will succeed in every single exercise!"

Anyone desiring to purchase a firearm must be able to pass a background check. There are age limits on the sale of certain items. And certain types of items are illegal in certain places - for example 'assault weapons' cannot be sold in California. The NRA also has put together a terrific NRA guide to state-by-state gun laws. The ATF has compiled information on the various state laws; click here to view the ATF state-by-state gun laws information. Again, it is your responsibility to make sure that you comply with the laws of your country, city, and state.

You do not have to be a licensed dealer to buy a firearm. If you are not a licensed dealer (also called an FFL Holder), you must make arrangements with an FFL holder in your state to receive the item and transfer it to you. The FFL holder will typically charge a nominal fee for providing this service. In addition to the fees listed, the FFL holder may be required by law to collect sales tax, background check fees, or other transfer-related fees."

The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge. 
The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 
The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters. 
From the very beginning of the design and development, computers have been used exclusively. All machined components are also made on modern high speed computerized equipment. Equally advanced quality control equipment and test procedures ensure a firearm with uncompromising quality in materials and workmanship.

Burris Technology

Burris uses lenses with a greater diameter than the competition
• “Signature Select” scopes lenses are 40% larger than the competition in 1” tubes
• “Fullfield II” lenses are 25% larger than the competition in 
1” tubes

MODEL TUBE DIAMETER LENSES DIAMETER
Black Diamond™ 30 mm 15.4 mm
Euro Diamond™ 30 mm 15.4 mm
Signature Select™ 25.4 mm 15.4 mm
Fullfield® II 25.4 mm 13.8 mm
Others 30 mm 15 mm
Others 25.4 mm 11.0 mm



Unique Technical Features
The outer tubes & internal components are extremely robust.
The adjustment system is:
- repeatable
- steel on steel
- with audible clicks
Double internal spring force. Every Burris scope has it.



Posi-Lock
• Posi-Lock is a coil-spring assisted retractable steel post that firmly and & securely locks accuracy into place. 
• Once the reticle is zeroed, the covering tube (red) replaces the internal spring (green) & locks the inner tube in place. 
• All scopes have one spring that allows the adjustment of the reticle. 
Some of the competition competitors offer a double spring whereas the double spring is the STANDARD for all Burris products. 
• As an optional, it’s possible to have the special Posi-Lock system. 
Posi-Lock scopes remain perfectly zeroed year after year even during transportation.

In the closed position, the force of the spring is substituted by the force of the steel post on the internal tube of the scope.



On all rifle scopes:
• Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope
• Every scope is individually recoil, water and fogproof tested 
• Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage



Recoil Test
Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests
An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration.
This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.

Waterproof Test
All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof.
Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C.
The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. 


Fog Test
The nitrogen contained in the scope is:
• of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen)
• ultra pure
• ultra clean
To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of 
• pressurizing the scope
• subjecting it to a vacuum
The tests are both cost & time intensive


I do not have the packaging for either item.

Anyone desiring to purchase a firearm must be able to pass a background check. There are age limits on the sale of certain items. And certain types of items are illegal in certain places - for example 'assault weapons' cannot be sold in California. The NRA also has put together a terrific NRA guide to state-by-state gun laws. The ATF has compiled information on the various state laws; click here to view the ATF state-by-state gun laws information. Again, it is your responsibility to make sure that you comply with the laws of your country, city, and state.

You do not have to be a licensed dealer to buy a firearm. If you are not a licensed dealer (also called an FFL Holder), you must make arrangements with an FFL holder in your state to receive the item and transfer it to you. The FFL holder will typically charge a nominal fee for providing this service. In addition to the fees listed, the FFL holder may be required by law to collect sales tax, background check fees, or other transfer-related fees."

i believe colt produced bright stainless cobras, but, ive never seen one. thanks

The outside metal is pitted and the straight uncheckered stock is beat up as hell, but strong, not split or cracked. The only blue is on the hammer and some of the bolt and rear sight. The bore has shiny rifling but is far from new. The inside of the action is nice and smooth. It was kept oiled and loaded. I bought it to use over 15 years ago. Some cowboy action shooters have the finish removed from newer guns so they have the ""old look"". This is an authentic working antique that can still be used. The action is strong and the recoil is light allowing quick follow up shots for varmints or target competition. It looks right at home in an old west display yet you can pull it off the rack and shoot the heck out of it.  * serial # in 400000 range dates this to 1908-1910 per proxibid. It's over 100 years old !!  *I can't do photos, NO  SHIPPING, OR TRADES, CASH SALE TO OHIO RESIDENT ONLY.

Technical description of the Monster Truck RTR:
The undercarriage of the Monster models is built on a 4 mm angled alloy plate. All borings for fixation of the chassis parts at the bottom side are countersunk in order to prevent the screw heads from sticking out. At the front axle you have the possibility to adjust toe-in or toe-out through track rods with right-hand/left-hand thread. The wheel camber of the rear wheels can be adjusted individually through adjusting screws with right-hand/left-hand thread. 8 large-volume oil-pressure shock absorbers are mounted at the lower double wishbones of front and rear axle, these are able to absorb larger shocks of jumps to a great extent and care for an optimal road grip. All rotating drive components are supported by ball bearings. 90% of the highly stressed steel parts such as rear gearwheels, differential gears and drive components are hardened. Fuel tank and radio control parts are protected through alloy plates at the sides. The Monster tires with tire inserts are glued on chrome-plated rims. The body is made of coloured white polycarbonate.
The models are equipped with a powerful 26ccm combustion engine with ready-for-use oiled air filter. The engine runs with normal 2-stroke petrol-oil mixture (available at every petrol station). The tank filling of 0,7 litres enables you to run your model around 45 minutes. With the installed pull-start system the engine can be started without any difficulties

He'll approach you if you have a WTB or WTT ad and say he's got something you're looking for.  The usual stuff.  Then he wants you to send a Money Order or even a western union to him in the Chicago area.  This guy poses as Sgt. in the US Army, claims to be an Afghan War Veteran and says stupid stuff like this thinking he's going to earn your trust ""I'm  military man so shipping is no problem.I can send you my Military ID so that you can know the kind of person you are dealing with... "".  Ha, what a joke.  He sent me this home made forgery of a US Army ID.  Isn't there someone who can locate and prosecute this guy?  I won't spoil all his stupid mistakes that are such a tip off because I don't want him to learn from them (although as stupid as this guy is, I doubt he is capable of learning).  If he tried to contact you, stay away, or just string him along and waste his time.  He gives this address to send payment to, so it must either be a drop off point, a vacant house where he can grab any mail, or someone he knows that will let him pickup the payment there and deny knowing him.  Who knows, he may still live at home with his mom and this is her address.  316 north beull ave. Aurora illionis 60506.  I think he even typo'd his own payment address and he meant to type Buell Ave.  If someone lives by there, photocopy the attached file and post it up/down his street like a lost dog.  It's a shame Armslist doesn't provide a better way to report fraudulent contacts like him, but honestly his tactics are so horrible, that if you're dumb enough to send this guy $, you deserve to pay a stupid tax."

As one of the deluxe model rifles, it has a rosewood forend, and finger grooves along the side of the fore stock. It has the Monte Carlo style stock. 

This Rifle is equiped with a Leupold 3x 9 VARI-X IIc, Gold Ring Scope. The Power of the Scope is not noted anywhere I can find. There is a 40mm version and a 50mm version of this mocel number. I will sell it as a 40mm until the true power can ve determined.

History of the Smith & Wesson Husqvarna

Husqvarna started to Import their rifles to S&W back in the Mid to late 1960's time span. They were built on the small ring Mauser action and called the 1640 action. The action was built by Husqvarna and was in essence a scaled down version of the 98 action. Earlier Husqvarna rifles sold in Sweden had the 96 Mauser style actions. they Offered them in A, B, C, & D variations. The Main differences in variations was wood offerings. The ""A"" Model was offered in High gloss Urethane, Husqvarna called them Plastic finish back then. The B, & C Models had Plain looking stocks lacking cheek pieces or the Monte Carlo feature that the ""A""s had. I Think The C's had a Schnabel forend. The ""D"" Model was a Mannlicher version. They were available in the following caliber's 22-250, 243 Winchester, 270 Winchester, 7mm Rem Mag 308 Winchester and 30-06 Springfield.These rifles were offered in beech or Walnut and had hand checkering. The deluxe rifles had rosewood forend, and finger grooves along the side of the fore stock. They were a Push feed action with drop magazines, and the barrels are Cold Hammer Forged.

In or around the 1967 time span Husqvarna made an action change in their rifles actions. The new action was called the 1900 action. Although never officially approved, the engineers at Husqvarna in free moments started playing with the thoughts of a new rifle concept, based on the following specifications: 1) The bolt should have an absolutely smooth action. 2) The rear of the cartridge should be completely surrounded by supporting steel. 3) The safety catch should lock the firing pin. 4) Direct trigger mechanism independent of bolt tolerances. 5) Adjustable trigger pull without taking the gun apart. 6) A 10% production cost reduction compared with the older 1640 actions, that were proving to be too expensive to produce. At some point, the work bore fruits, and the engineers revealed their work for the management. Management accepted the ideas presented, and after some adjustments, the 200 first weapons named the 1900 series were presented for sale in 1967 for local sale in Sweden. 

Later They called it the 1970 Standard version of the 1900 action series Rifles. They were made from 1967 until 1970 and the  Monte Carlo version from 1968 until 1970. Except for the stock the two versions are identical. They generally had leaf sights and a semi spherical silver front bead enclosed by a protective hood. The magazine lid was engraved, the walnut stock checkered at the wrist and at the forestock. 

These were the Finest rifles S&W ever offered, and now Husqvarna is out of Business.... They made a Supreme rifle and if you are at all interested in one of these, you should consider this rare one that is available: They do not show up often any more...as most that have them keep them due to their high quality and great accuracy."

511,http://www.armslist.com/posts/456511,For Sale:  Earliest known Winchester 20ga. w/Madis letter,"Round Rock – Texas, Houston, Texas","$ 3,400","Listed On: Tuesday, July 3, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"It seems that when it comes to Winchester collecting, it is difficult to find a piece that is TRULY unique. This is that kind of collectible firearm. I am looking forward to this gun having more exposure than it would otherwise get in a private auction. In 1878, with its name firmly established in the rifle trade, Winchester decided that it was time to get into the shotgun market. With no in-house facilities to produce shotguns, Winchester contracted with English gunmakers to produce the very first shotguns to carry the Winchester name. Less than 1500 of these English doubles were produced. Of this number, only 3 guns are known to exist with gauges other than 12 or 10; one is a 16 gauge and two are 20 gauges. Prior to its discovery by the current owner, it was thought that Match Gun #1314 was the oldest/only English 20ga. double to exist. In his book, ""Winchester Shotguns and Shotshells,"" author Ronald Stadt features pictures of #1314, but specifically mentions #1312 at least three times. In the book, Stadt openly questions the existence of #1312 and perhaps what it was. 1312 is the oldest 20ga. shotgun to carry the company name. This shotgun is featured on p.7 of Dennis Adler's book, Winchester Shotguns. Full historical documentation in the form of a five-page handwritten letter from the late George Madis, foremost authority on Winchester firearms and author of ""The Winchester Book,"" ""The Winchester Model 12,"" and other definitive books, will be provided on the website dedicated to this gun. (see link) 1312's condition leaves quite a bit to be desired. It appears that someone attempted to refinish the stock. The wood as well as the checkering has been sanded and a coat of finish was applied. The original hammers have been replaced with others of the correct size. Thankfully, the metal was left untouched. There is pitting in the bores. Obviously the gun must never be fired, even with the proper ammunition. At this price, 1312 might be a good candidate for a restoration. This is a once in a lifetime chance for the collector to acquire a piece that is not only rare but historically significant. This gun has been in calendars and newspaper articles. This gun has allowed me to meet or correspond with authors and Winchester professionals that I would probably never have had the opportunity to meet. It's really been a lot of fun. A couple of years ago, I sent 1312 to Doug Turnbull Restorations for an examination. During a phone conversation, the restoration specialist told me that he was standing in a room full of some of the rarest Winchesters in existence, but 1312 was the only one that felt truly unique. He said that the others felt like variations of the same thing. No sneaky reserves, just a low opening bid. I will allow a five day inspection period with buyer paying all shipping charges. Item is guaranteed to be true to description. No FFL necessary for this auction. If you are interested in this gun, be sure and email me and I will give you a phone number to contact me."

Anyone desiring to purchase a firearm must be able to pass a background check. There are age limits on the sale of certain items. And certain types of items are illegal in certain places - for example 'assault weapons' cannot be sold in California. The NRA also has put together a terrific NRA guide to state-by-state gun laws. The ATF has compiled information on the various state laws; click here to view the ATF state-by-state gun laws information. Again, it is your responsibility to make sure that you comply with the laws of your country, city, and state.

You do not have to be a licensed dealer to buy a firearm. If you are not a licensed dealer (also called an FFL Holder), you must make arrangements with an FFL holder in your state to receive the item and transfer it to you. The FFL holder will typically charge a nominal fee for providing this service. In addition to the fees listed, the FFL holder may be required by law to collect sales tax, background check fees, or other transfer-related fees."

The ATF has compiled information on the various state laws; click here to view the ATF state-by-state gun laws information. Again, it is your responsibility to make sure that you comply with the laws of your country, city, and state.

You do not have to be a licensed dealer to buy a firearm.

Anyone desiring to purchase a firearm must be able to pass a background check. There are age limits on the sale of certain items. And certain types of items are illegal in certain places - for example 'assault weapons' cannot be sold in California. The NRA also has put together a terrific NRA guide to state-by-state gun laws. The ATF has compiled information on the various state laws; click here to view the ATF state-by-state gun laws information. Again, it is your responsibility to make sure that you comply with the laws of your country, city, and state.

You do not have to be a licensed dealer to buy a firearm. If you are not a licensed dealer (also called an FFL Holder), you must make arrangements with an FFL holder in your state to receive the item and transfer it to you. The FFL holder will typically charge a nominal fee for providing this service. In addition to the fees listed, the FFL holder may be required by law to collect sales tax, background check fees, or other transfer-related fees."

Anyone desiring to purchase a firearm must be able to pass a background check. There are age limits on the sale of certain items. And certain types of items are illegal in certain places - for example 'assault weapons' cannot be sold in California. The NRA also has put together a terrific NRA guide to state-by-state gun laws. The ATF has compiled information on the various state laws; click here to view the ATF state-by-state gun laws information. Again, it is your responsibility to make sure that you comply with the laws of your country, city, and state.

You do not have to be a licensed dealer to buy a firearm. If you are not a licensed dealer (also called an FFL Holder), you must make arrangements with an FFL holder in your state to receive the item and transfer it to you. The FFL holder will typically charge a nominal fee for providing this service. In addition to the fees listed, the FFL holder may be required by law to collect sales tax, background check fees, or other transfer-related fees."

Description:

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount. Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.

¦Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
¦Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space
¦Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
¦Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours

Started off with new bare frame and slide from Rock Island Armory. The frame was cut for Ed Brown bobtailed mainspring housing. The front strap was hand checkered with the main spring housing and back of slide at 25 lines per inch. Frame was also relived at trigger guard for better grip. New Ed Brown beavertail was installed and blended in after cutting the tangs at a .250 radius. New Wilson sear and disconnetor installed after fitting them with a marvel jig along with hammer. Frame was media blasted and coated with Brownells Alumicoat in silver. Flats were polished and reblued on slide after installing new three dot sights. Trigger has a four pound pull and is very nice. Custom Wilson black oak grips were fitted to the frame for the bob tailed frame. I am pretty firm on the price but would consider trades. No black powder or bows and to be honest trades will have to be in my favor. The price is a cash price not trade value. I would give great consideration for a M&P compact in 9mm.

This rifle is chambered in 223. The stock is an olive drab green hogue stock that is pillar bedded. It also has a 20 inch fluted heavy barrel. The twist rate is 1:9. The muzzle was professionally threaded 1/2x28. Also installed is a YHM compensator/qd suppressor mount. An oversized tactical bolt knob has also been installed. The factory trigger seems to have a really awesome pull but I have not fired it. This rifle has never been fired at all. It has been moved around a bit and does have a few handling marks but nothing more. The rifle has a 20moa picatinny top mount rail. The scope is a 16x42 SWFA Super Sniper Scope that hasn't been zeroed in. The scope also has a sun shade and butler creek flip caps. The scope rings are UTG quick detach rings. 


FN guarantees these rifles to shoot 1 moa. This rifle should easily shoot sub moa if the shooter does his or her part. I originally purchased this rifle to hunt coyotes on my farm. After scouting my land for a few nights, I realize that most of my targets are going to be in brushy areas because this is where they roost.

Whether chasing after a wild boar or anticipating a 10 point mule deer, the Ambush 300AAC Blackout supplies ample knock-down power while reducing recoil.

The Ambush Firearms 300 BlackOut is designed to be shot suppressed and un-surpressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions.  The testing of the Ambush Firearms 300 BlackOut firearms indicates that un-surpressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend.  Although, though our extensive testing we did ascertain that the utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-surpressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.

(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksj-XJzVQik)  

It is a duotone job with the ""graphite black"" on the slide and the ""sig grey"" on the frame, giving it the reverse two tone look. It was done professionally by the company so no worries about it being an amateur job. It cost me 150.00 to get both the slide and frame CERAKOTE'ed, and then another 30.00 (180.00 total without shipping) for the duotone because they were different colors. Looks completely natural, no flaw in the workmanship at all. The only way to tell that it is coated is to hold it up to a regular reverse two tone SIG. It's a beautiful piece of art and workmanship. Flawless. Has an extremely low round count through it. Has been cleared and oiled ever time it has been shot. I'd like 600 for this piece of art, but I need the money so I am bringing it down to 476.00 and even though it would probably break my heart I might be persuaded to bring it down a bit more. I bought the gun for 380.00 total and then put the 180.00 coat on it. So a 560.00 deal package for 476.00. Seems very reasonable for to me. Make me an offer and we can see what we can do.
