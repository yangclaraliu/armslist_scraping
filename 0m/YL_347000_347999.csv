Using the 10rd mag that came with the kit LOOKS way sweeter, but I wouldn't use it unless I wanted to manually shoot each round.
As you can see, it has a dummy silencer on the barrel. It comes with a flash suppressor so you can change that out if you like.  
Also, I have the original wood stock and hardware so you can change it back to a regular old 10/22 rifle if your heart so desires.
The Archangel Nomad kits are hard to find, they're pretty much sold out everywhere. I know why, too.  Cause it looks so flippin' sweet.

This shotgun has amazing fine rating scroll engraving on the antique silver finish receiver, action release tang, etc. It has retained most of its original metal finish as it has been stored in a safe for years.

This shotgun is used and has very minor handling marks, but please do refer to pictures. It has been well maintained even though it's been stored in a safe for years. Overall, it is a very well-made & solid field gun, the engraving is just splendid, a great value for an Italian shotgun, and simply a very nice gun to own.

220,http://www.armslist.com/posts/347220,Want To Buy:  WTB your worn looking Savage 110 111 112 114 116 type rifle,"Southwest, Jacksonville, North Carolina",Offer,"Listed On: Friday, April 6, 2012",Rifles,Savage Arms                                                                                ,no type,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"As the title says, I'm looking for this type of rifle.  Exterior condition is not as important as all parts are serviceable, it doesn't have deep rust pits, and the rifleing is in good shape.  I'm not looking for something that is pretty, as I am going to rebarrel, reblue, and restock it any way, most likely.  That being said, I do not want to buy a beat up rifle and pay a price that is going to make me feel beat up as well, so please be reasonable.  Savages in the condition I am looking for are not worth a lot.  I don't need a rifle with a scope, so don't figure that into the price of the rifle, just take it off if you want to, or leave it on, but I'm only interested in the rifle.  If you have a Savage that is worth more than what you think I'll be willing to pay, after reading my description of what I'm looking for, you probably don't need to contact me about it, but it won't bother me if you do, and a few minutes of my time won't kill me, so go ahead and email me if you'd like to.  I live in between Jacksonville NC and Richlands NC, and am only interested in private party face to face transactions within 10 miles of Jacksonville.  I don't like meeting in the middle of a packed parking lot to look at a rifle either, not with all the paranoia that abounds in our society, so please, if you want to meet at your place or mine, or in the woods, that is fine, as I'm sure you can take care of yourself as well as I can take care of myself, but I don't like having a SWAT team deployed to surround you and I while we look at a firearm.  I have a family, with one on the way, and am a retired Marine, I'm not out looking for trouble, just throwing that our there, as I'm not doing anything illegal that will put my family in peril, I'm too old for that stuff.

One of the strongest investments in firearms.

Here is a beautiful Smith and Wesson Model 29-2 Nickle revolver . 44 Remington Magnum. 8 3/8"" with pinned barrel . Red ramp insert front sight, adjustable white outline rear sight. This gun is in excellent condition. As we all know, a Smith revolver in this condition are a great investment, going higher fast. We will not haggle on this auction. I have a 1970 Shooter Book where this gun is listed as brand new at $165..00. Sorry, those days are long gone. However, it just shows how consistant this gun is at increasing in value. The Smith & Wesson Model 29 is a six-shot, double-revolver chambered for the 44 Magnum cartridge and manufactured by Smith & Wesson. It was made famous by and is still most often associated with the fictional character Dirty Harry Callahan from the Dirty Harry series of films staring Clint Eastwood. This gun is one powerful weapon.

SIG SAUER® P250 Wins Two NRA Golden Bullseye Awards 

SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year.

This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250® is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose.

The new SIG SAUER® P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber: 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select
 one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it’s a fully customized P250. But then you can change
 everything to meet new requirements. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance.

It would also be a excellent rifle for a beginning shooter as well. Additional pictures upon request. Please…….serious inquiries only.

YHM Low Profile Gas Block
YHM Flash Hider
DPMS Heavy Chrome Lined Barrel Chambered In 556

The upper only has about 500 rounds through it.

**Edit** People keep emailing me about NFA questions.    Here we go.  The upper of an AR is just a collection of parts under the law.  This is not considered a firearm and does not require any special paperwork to own or transfer.   This upper can be mounted on any AR lower.  If the lower has a stock, you need to apply for a tax stamp.  If it is an AR pistol lower, no paperwork or NFA laws apply.   This item is legal for anyone who can legally own a gun.

***Edit (Again)***   So, people keep emailing me saying things that are simply wrong about the laws of owning a SBR.  Everything I said above is true so I figure the best way is to let you read the law yourself since debating via email is an exercise in futility.

Has been modified with Wolff springs to reduce recoil, double action pull and mag release force. Recoil and double action pull are the two main complaints about this gun. A stronger recoil spring makes it much more comfortable to shoot. a weaker hammer spring reduces the force required for the double action pull and makes it much easier to release the magazine.

The small size and single stack mag makes this a very nice gun for concealed carry. Fits easily in a pocket and there are various holsters available.

They made the various modifications pictured here, provided a canvas roll bag. The set was then strapped to the ejection seat in their fighter aircraft. A few years ago less than 200 of them were imported into the U.S.

Pix #2, Among the Israeli modifications was to shorten the barrel to 13 inches. Before the importer could re-sell the guns he had to attach the 3 inch simulated muzzle break to bring it back out to a legal minimum 16"".

Pix #3, Nearly all the changes made to the gun were done with pre-existing parts. Note the grip is for an FAL. Forward sling swivel is for an L1A1. I'm not sure what the canvas sling was used on but it is original to the gun.

Pix #4, Close up of the barrel just ahead of the chamber. Note the serial numbered on the barrel not done on factory Armalites. Also the importer's stamp under  The Armalite address.(not shown)

Pix #5, Barrel removed & stock collapsed. Package length would have been 13"" had the 3"" barrel extension not been added for legality. Note the front sight, it's for a K98 Mauser!(not shown)

The price is $650 firm, however I will knock $200 off the price of the rifle if you don't want the scope.  These rifles sell new for $580+ on Gunbroker, and the scope retails for ~$300.

For sale is a lightly used Sig P238 that was bought new 6 months ago. It has a polished stainless steel slide and barrel. It comes with a total of 6 magazines. It also has an aluminum trigger and custom aluminum billet grips. Factory P238 pistols all come with very cheap plastic triggers, get a unique quality pistol with an all metal trigger! The slide has undergone a de-horning process which smooths out corners that would likely snag on clothing during holstering or removing from your holster and looks almost identical to the Sig P238 SAS version that comes from the factory. It includes factory night sights that are nice and bright. Comes with factory case, fired casing and everything else that came with it. It comes with 2 6 round factory magazines.  It also comes with the factory belt holster but i will also include an Uncle Mikes inside the pants holster.

You will also receive: 1 factory 7 round magazine with xgrip, 2 Metalform 6 round magazines 7 round Metalform magazine. Metalform makes Sigs magazines so these are the exact same as Sig magazines just with a different brand on the bottom of them.

 This is a fantastic weapon and is very accurate and reliable. I am only selling this to help provide a down payment on our first home. I have shot no more than 200 rounds through this pistol and they were all factory loaded ammunition. If you have any other questions feel free to ask, i have several pictures that you can see by clicking the link below. Thanks.

This gun was Brand spanking new until today when I fired a box of 50 rounds of federal ball ammo through her. She functioned flawless on every round and was very, very accurate for such a small gun. I just decided after shooting it, that she is a little too snappy for me to hold on to. 

It comes with everything new from the factory, 6 round flush fit mag, case, manual, trigger lock, even the plastic bag and tag from the trigger gaurd. 

I am also including in the deal a like new Sticky brand holster made for the Kahr CM/PM series guns. These holsters are awesome and go inside the pants and are designed to stay put even if your only wear gym shorts with no ties. They form to body heat and mold to the fit of the gun. ($25 value)

I am also including a 25 round box of Federal 135gr low recoil Hydroshock hollowpoints. ($25 value)




I am looking to trade for something small and thin, but perhaps a tad bigger than the CM9, I will accepts offers for just about anything, but I am not interested in trades for any caliber less than 9mm. I will also take $440 FIRM! for all.

Description from website:
""Lightweight, comfortable, and adaptable to a wide range of holsters and accessory pouches, the VTAC Brokos Belt is made by Warriors for Warriors!

The innovative and practical Viking Tactics Brokos Belt (VTAC-BB) was created for the kitted up gunslinger in the battlefield or on the range. Designed to fit issued Molle gear and most belt attachment on the market, the VTAC Brokos belt is not your ordinary belt. Weighing less than 8 ounces and made from 500d Cordura padded with 3D spacer mesh, the VTAC Brokos Belt is constructed to be lightweight and durable. A 6 -inch high-density plastic insert reinforces the belt, allowing the wearer to carry heavy loads for long periods of time. In addition, this belt features belt weaving slots located every 3 inches across the Molle allowing the shooter versatility and modularity in attaching his kit.

M (32-34), L (36-38), XL (40-42), XXL (44-46)""

----------------------------------------------------
Also, for an extra $50 I will include an X-Large Coyote VTAC Cobra belt designed to be used as an inner belt for the Brokos belt. Price online is $60.00

This is a great system, but I really don't need this kit anymore, and I need to start downsizing.

I will meet face to face in the Fayetteville area, or ship for an additional $10.00.

I have taken squirrels out past 150 yds with no exaggeration.  The rifle is in excellent condition with a few minor ""vault dings"" and the blueing is rich and 95% or better.  These rifles were made from 1970-74 but were before thier time.  The ammo was expensive and the round never ""caught on"".  The round shoots as flat as the .17 and hits harder than the 22mag.  I got the rifle, had it converted to centerfire (Craig Conversion), purchased a custom set of RCBS dies, virgin brass, and molly bullets.

Remington 591M 5mm Mag converted to centerfire (Craig conversion).  This rifle was manufactured in 1973.  Like I previously stated the condition is remarketable for 40 years old!  Included is approx 100 rnds of brass, about 100 bullets, 1lb of Win 296, custon RCBS dies w/ extended shell holder, Bushnell 3x9 40mm banner scope , rings, and mounts.

I have over $1100.00 invested and am only getting rid of her due to an injury that precludes my ability to hunt.  If you want something that is different and a blast to shoot please take a look.  The Craig round: 36gr @ 2300+fps, the rifle has excellent accuracy and a crisp trigger.  The weal part of these rifles is the mgazine, the magazine is in excellent shape condition.  The .204 bullet is now widely available and you can get bullet weights to 50grs.  I have better pics and will provide upon request.

If I get time to do it I will, if not, its up to you. As of 9 years ago it fired as per my old man. I don't know, I personally have not fired it. It has been in my family since its manufacture according to him as well. I took it to Central Michigan Gunsmithing and he told me that even with some of the patina its a great shotgun but it just needs to be cleaned internally. He also said I could easily get 500 or more with a new pump handle
