-additional comment added oct. 1- i have had several inquiries on this, some have asked if i would consider trades and i cannot take trades because i need the money to payoff debt. also, i have had some ask if i would take less and i will not. $950 is firm, i have searched several online gunsites and i have not found a colt ar-15 for less. i found 1 for $975 (sold), but most were around $1100 and up. colt is the name in ar-15s, and are mil spec with the best parts, trigger assembly, barrel etc. which makes colt superior in performance and reliabiltiy.  google colt sporter lightweight for sale and see if you can find one for less, then add shipping and ffl fees to it ($65+) if out of state."

252,http://www.armslist.com/posts/587252,For Sale/Trade:  M35 beretta 1944,"westminster, Colorado, United States",$ 525,"Listed On: Thursday, October 25, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"**ww2 beretta model 1935  ""m35""**
records indicate this beretta pistol was included in a delivery of 65,000 Beretta M1934/35 pistols delivered to the German Army Headquarters in Italy between Aug 1944 and Feb, 1945. Those serial # were 534000/599000.- ""mine has #'s in that range""
 After the 8 September 1943 armistice between Italy and the Allies, the Germans saddled Beretta with three engineers from Germany. Moreover the factory was GARRISONED BY THE SS! Weapons of that time, even the ones produced for the Germans, bore the punch mark 4UT, (Quarto Ufficio tecnico di Controllo Armi e Munizioni--4th Technnical Control Unit...
-an C. Still, in Axis Pistols, page 107, states,
""It is likely that almost all of the 4/UT, ...were used by the German Army"". He also includes two other variations in this statement, ""1944 dated and blank slide Model 1935"".
Ugo Menchini, in Pietro Beretta Le Automatiche, regarding an M1934, page 255, states,
""In late 1940 there appears an oval including the punch mark IVU. It refers to the 4th technical Control Unit of the FAG, where inspection was carried out.""
 Note that, while they seem to represent the same inspectors, the ""IVU"" is not the same mark as the ""4UT"". The IVU would be found on the pre RSI model M1934, and the 4UT would be found on the RSI model M1935.
 These are the reasons why I believe that it is likely that all of the 4UT Berettas WERE RSI pistols!! the IVU and the 4UT were the same office, but under Italian management -the IVU, before the surrender of Italy, and German the 4UT, so after september, 8 1943.

For sale is my 9mm DW Guardian commander sized bobtail. This gun is a factory blem and priced as such. The blem is some hazing around the serial number and address. (this was apparently a common issue with a batch of Guardians) The gun is in excellent condition and has no takedown mark. According to the previous owner it has around 200 rounds down the pipe. It has black double diamond grips and has contrasting night sights. The fired shell casing date is 6/11. Comes in original box with paperwork and two factory mags.
 Trade interests would be other 1911s in full or commander size only. +/- cash for the right deal.

I MAY also consider trade combinations of Glock 19, FNP9, FNX9, CZ75, Beretta 92, Ruger Mark III, Buckmark, AR style 22 Rifle, Cash, accessories, ammo.

Model 67-22 W.R.F.  This rifle has been in my family over  50 years.   My brothers and I all learned to shoot with this WRF.  The stock is in fair condition but could be sanded down and refinished.  It's pretty easy refinish by rubbing on coats of Linseed oil. There are three holes on the left side of then barrel  that were drilled to mount a scope but as far as I know there's never been a scope on this rifle.  The barrel has some pitting but not bad. Site ramp is missing and has been ever since I can remember.
This would be a great gun for the starting rifleman."

Will not take $50 or $100 bucks, so don't ask.  The magazines sell for $100 by themselves.  Trades I'm looking for are .22 pistol, .357 mag, or would consider any handguns... Other .22 rifles, muzzle loaders, shotguns, open.... Feel free to ask any questions..."

Shot 20 rounds at range. Great very accurate gun. Looking for a smaller gun. 

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

This is Yamaha’s flagship model with well over 200 Supercharged horsepower with a 1.8 liter (1812cc) Intercooled engine and electronic ignition. The nice thing about this model year is that is has been engineered to run on 87 Octane fuel, rather than having to use the higher rated more expensive Super Unleaded fuel. Heralded as the most award-winning watercraft of all time, the FX SHO pairs the massive torque of the industry's largest engine with the responsive ride of a NanoXcel hull and deck. Possessing an undeniably confident design that allows for supreme stability and unmatched power when offshore riding, the FX SHO begs the question – is it still considered a race, if no one else can keep up? It has the perfect combination of power, speed, comfort, and technology with seating for up to 3 people. This watercraft is equipped with the following features: Cruise Assist, No Wake Mode, Quick Shift Trim System, Low RPM Mode and Security Mode with Remote Transmitter, Fuel Management System, Reverse with Traction Control, Watertight Storage, and Pull up Cleats, Tile Steering, and a reboarding step. The trailer is made by Silver Fox trailers here in Colorado and has no exposed wiring. All wiring is routed through the frame for a much cleaner look. I will include two life vests (both are Yamaha; 1 Large and 1 Medium), two lanyards (for the safety-kill), and a cover. The color is Bronze Metallic, and we are selling it because we are buying a boat. I can be reached at local – three 9 one then a space and three nine 2 zero. Serious inquires only please."

 Older hand select Romanian PSL-54C demill kit built by / on Tennessee Guns Int'l receiver. Front trunnion is a specified screw build with the remainder being the standard riveted TGI receiver assembly. It has been properly headspaced / drilled, lubed and 'tuned', but has never been fired. There was also a reinforced swivel stud installed on the lower handguard specifically for a bipod. A bipod, Plano foam padded case and a TGI manual included as well. Basically, a complete PSL rifle package and as 'new' as you can get.

 All accessories for this PSL / FPK are either new, unissued or unused, as originally received from TGI and  include:

Complete bayonet / scabbard / frog
Leather sling
Complete cleaning kit
3-piece cleaning rod
4 mag capacity field pouch
Two magazines (1 is unnumbered)
Romanian TIP2 6x24 side rail mounted scope
Scope cover
Scope cleaning cloth
Yellow scope lens filter

 The cleaning kit has all of the usual parts. A 7.62x54R extractor, gas port reamer, cleaning jag, brush, pin tool, grease bottle, tube / cap and a nice black pouch to keep all of it in, PLUS a spare sight post, extractor retaining pin, spring and a firing pin retainer. It all fits in the field pouch, which has multiple pockets inside and out.

 All of the serial numbered components on the rifle match, except for the bolt itself and the made in Romania TGI receiver serial number. It is the original Romanian chrome lined barrel with sharp rifling and it's mirror bright. It has the matching numbered threaded muzzle device (14x1mm LH) and the intact bayonet lug. The earlier TGI contracted receivers included the bolt hold open center support piece, but do NOT include the little parts (spring, pin and lifter foot, etc.). The scope rail was milled, so the scope fits (most all PSL's came with an unfinished scope rail..). The Romanian parkerized finish was also completely blued over externally, so it looks good and will wear a little better too.

  I also have some extremely scarce 7N1 Russian sniper ammo and some brass case / boxer primed reloadable cartridges available. Prices for larger quantities of ammo are separate and negotiable only with the purchase of the rifle, but whoever buys this PSL locally will receive a sample amount of each type to compare.

 This is a $1050.00 Cash / USPS Money Order / Cashier's Check sale and the price is FIRM!

This gun was built in 1921 and is in very good condition (see pictures).  It weighs 6 pounds 1 ounce on my postal scale, has 2 1/2"" chambers, a 14"" LOP to a replacement pad, a 1 5/8"" drop at comb, and 2 5/8"" drop at heel. It does not appear to have any cast. The blueing is in very good condition and is original. The wood is in great shape, as is the checkering; however, there is a small hairline crack just behind the receiver on one side - it has been there a long time and has not changed despite shooting the gun a number of times. There are no dents or scratches in the wood, only one small crack as noted earlier. There is one spot on the barrels where the blueing is slightly scratched from use (this is shown in the pictures). There are slight case colors on the receiver. The gun locks up very tight and the open lever is slightly to the right, indicating it hasn't seen very extensive use. The ejectors work perfectly. This is a great example of a nice grade Fox small bore with desirable 30"" barrels in great condition.  I would price this gun significantly higher if it didn't have the small crack in the stock.  I have many more pictures I can send - just let me know if you want them."
