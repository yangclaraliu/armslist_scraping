Occasionally (!!!!) I may be interested in a trade, occasionally.  Email me first with your idea and we'll go from there; that goes for a sale as well as trades.
I appreciate your looking at my ad and your consideration.  Best Wishes from the Big Sky Country!!  REDACTED"

Well, when I inspected the gun, it was obvious that the 70 round count was more like 700 without being cleaned.  He gave me the gun in its box with 2 mags and the worn out holster.  When I asked about the other 3 mags, he gave me some lame assed story about them being under all his clothes in the trunk and said he would deliver them to me when he found them, however he also said it he thought it was only 2 mags.  Hey, that's a big difference, especially on a gun that's obviously been abused.  Well, now this SOB has disappeared from the face of the earth.  Not really surprised and it was my mistake, but it still doesn't sit well with me.  Watch out for this guy, because he's bogus as hell.

The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable butt stock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

This is a really neat gun being the first full sized swing out cylinder and used by the US army in the Spanish American War (Note I do not have a letter from colt and I'm not saying this gun was used in the Spanish American War simply this model is the same) The blueing is very warn but all the lettering and stamping is sharp. The hand needs replaced and they cost $35 on Numrich Gunparts website. Purchased it I shot a few rounds through it by cycling the cylinder by hand but I haven't shot it in a while. From what I've found online the serial number puts this gun as pre-1899 so it should be classified as an antique.

Update: due to the large amount of responses from people living further away than i am willing to drive, i want to add additional info. i am willing to drive 20 to 30 minutes from 45157 zip code. if you have something i would really like, i may drive further, but with cash sale that would be about it. i do not want to spend 30 in gas to sell for 465. this is not to be mean or nasty, i just dont live in toledo, columbus or akron. i am not selling this to feed my family, pay my mortgage, or my car payment if i had one. it is just a gloick i am willing to part with if their is something out there i like or the cash. if you are LE or even more so, military, i am willing to accomodate, because God knows their is a sad lack of patriotism and i will go out of my way to pay you back any way i can,  propper ID would need to be presented in this case. i appreciate the offers and THANK YOU TO ALL THE MEN & WOMEN WHO ARE SERVING to keep people like me and my family safe.

This is a used Kimber Custom TLE II (1911 .45 ACP  5"" barrel).  I am not the first owner of this Kimber (I bought this here on Armslist about a month ago).  I have personally fired ~8 rounds through it.  The gun has hammer follow and double fires. 

This Kimber is all black and has the factory Meprolight night sights and full length guide rod as well as the traditional 1911 extractor.  I don't know how many rounds have gone through it but a call to Kimber indicated a mfg. date of July 2008.  The finish is 90-95%.  There are some rookie marks (around slide stop-looks like when trying to reinstall) and the magazine release is a little scratched (on the ejection port side).  The barrel looks good, slide to frame fit is tight, plunger tube and ejector are tight as new too.  I detail stripped the weapon-everything appears to be stock/factory. 

I only put ~8 rounds through it-but it fed, fired, and ejected 100%.  Like I said it has hammer follow (hence I stopped shooting when this happened).  I swapped the sear spring with another 1911 and this did not fix the problem-my guess is the hammer/sear.  Dry firing and function tests show hammer follow about half the time (unfortunately not when I was buying it).  

I am selling the gun (as is) with the original Kimber case and manual, 2 Kimber 7 rd mags, bushing wrench, and a brand new Kimber black STEEL mainspring housing that I never installed.  

I am selling it for 600, I might trade for Springfield Loaded, maybe... (not GI or Mil Spec)"

This pistol was assembled by the French from left over Mauser parts during WWII and proofed, these are fairly rare as they were in production for only 2 years, story is ""Joe Stalin"" didnt like the allied countries assembling their pistols from nazi leftover parts...........

This pistol is NOT import marked and is in at least 90% condition. It has a very clean barrel and looked almost unshot and comes with a 1944-45 JVD mag that's also uncommon.With P1s going for over $400 this is a good buy if you're a WWII firearms collector or just like the P38 series in general

accepting all trades, call or email welcomed.

also, you get a post war 1961 P1 holster, not really a fancy holster but it's worth $20 or so.

Thanks and best regards

Trijicon ACOG 4x32 ECOS Scope TA01-ECOS - Dark Earth Brown With Amber Center Illumination Riflescope Rifle scope 

The Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Enhanced Combat Optical Sight (ECOS) TA01-ECOS is a new model riflescope that was designed for the Special Operations forces of the US military. Trijicon ACOG 4x32 ECOS Rifle Scopes TA01-ECOS feature the Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Gun Sight TA01 with the 3.25 MOA RMR LED Red Dot (RM01) or  Docter Optic 7.0 MOA Red Dot Sight mounted on top. Although designed primarily for Special OP forces of the military, these Trijicon Riflescopes are available for civilians and law enforcement. The Trijicon ACOG TA01 ECOS Scope features Trijicon's advanced tritium technology with back-up iron sights as specified by the U.S. Special Operation Command. This Trijicon ACOG ECOS Riflescope TA01 is the ultimate sight for both Close Quarter Battle (CQB) situations and longer distance shooting where accuracy and pinpoint bullet placement are required. Trijicon ACOG Scopes TA01ECOS also feature the new Dark Earth Brown color now required by special operations forces, a definite factor in concealment, directly contributing to the safety of the operator who is often in harm's way.

The Trijicon ACOG 4x 32mm ECOS Riflescope has a dual-sighting system that gives the shooter a distinct tactical advantage with the option of either the Trijicon ACOG or the Docter Red Dot Sight. With the quick target acquisition of the Docter RedDot Sight or the precise aiming capabilities provided by the magnified 4x power of the Trijicon ACOG, the shooter has the ability to select the proper aiming solution for the situation at hand. This system gives the shooter the best of both worlds.

The Trijicon Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) 4 x 32 Scope TA01-ECOS has a rugged, dependable aiming system with a Bullet Drop Compensated (BDC) reticle calibrated to the trajectory of the .223 cartridge and provides precision aiming for targets out to 1,000 meters. Trijicon 's battle-tested reticle technology is proven, in mission after mission, to hold zero under the most demanding of combat situations, gaining the faith and trust of America?s elite Special Forces units worldwide. The Trijicon ACOG ECOS Gun Sight is totally battery-free, with an amber reticle, and will not have you worry about having the optical sight fail due to low powered batteries.

The Rifle Scopes ' innovative sighting system weighs in at less than 16 ounces, and is designed for the M-16 series of rifles. A forged, 7075-T6 aluminum alloy housing gives the Trijicon ACOG TA01-ECOS durability beyond the call of duty, and multi-coated lenses provide maximum optical performance in any light. The Trijicon ACOG Scope is also waterproof (tested to 328 Ft / 100 Meters, five times the military?s required depth) and nitrogen filled to eliminate fogging. The Trijicon ACOG 4x32 ECOS Scope TA01-ECOS is made with pride in the USA at Trijicon 's Wixom, Michigan manufacturing facility.

The Trijicon ACOG 4x32 ECOS Scope is also available in a dual illumination model: Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Scope TA31-ECOS. The TA31-ECOS uses Trijicon ’s patented fiber optics and tritium-based technology with a reticle that glows red continually in bright light, low light or no light at all.

TA11E: Trijicon 3.5x35 ACOG Scope with Red Chevron BAC Reticle

The TA11E incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. The TA11E allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

The TA11E ranging reticle is calibrated for 7.62mm (.308 cal) flat-top rifles to 800 meters. Includes Flat Top Adapter (TA51). The chevron reticle is designed to be zeroed using the tip at 100 meters. The width of the chevron at the base is 5.53 MOA which is 19"" at 300 meters. This allows range estimation for silhouette targets.

The TA11E also includes:
-1 ACOG Picatinny Rail Mount (TA51)

This is a HK91, imported by Springfield Armory with the name SAR-3, just prior to the AWB of '89. This gun was subject to the ban both by name, and by configuration.

Due to that ban, SAR-3's already awaiting customs clearance had to be reconfigured with thumbhole stocks, no flash hiders, and a few other changes. They also had to be re-stamped with a different name.

This was accomplished by having someone actually overstamp the ""3"" with an ""8"", BY HAND. That makes this particular gun pretty collectible, as only a couple of hundred exist in the pre-ban configuration.

That's what this is. Pre-ban configured, overstamped SAR-3.

The gun was made in HK's Greek factory, by HK technicians, on HK machines, using HK tools.

It's a HK91 in every single way but name.

It comes with three 20 round magazines and a HK factory sling.

The price is $2500 cash, or $3000 in trade, or some combination of the two.

The TA11E incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. The TA11E allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

The TA11E ranging reticle is calibrated for 7.62mm (.308 cal) flat-top rifles to 800 meters. Includes Flat Top Adapter (TA51). The chevron reticle is designed to be zeroed using the tip at 100 meters. The width of the chevron at the base is 5.53 MOA which is 19"" at 300 meters. This allows range estimation for silhouette targets.

The TA11E also includes:
-1 ACOG Picatinny Rail Mount (TA51)
-1 3.5x35 Scopecoat (TA63)
-1 Large Sized Pelican Case (TA89)
-1 Lenspen (LENSPEN)

Trijicon TA11F-A ACOG 3.5x35 Rifle Scope - Chevron BAC .223 Flattop Reticle with Flat Top Adapter
Trijicon TA11F ACOG 3.5x35 Scope with Chevron BAC Reticle includes Trijicon Flat Top Adapter TA51. The ranging reticle of the Trijicon Gunsight is calibrated for 5.56mm (.223 cal) flat-top rifles out to 800 meters. The chevron reticle is designed to be zeroed using the tip at 100 meters. The width of the chevron at the base is 5.53 MOA which is 19"" at 300 meters. This allows range estimation for silhouette targets. Trijicon TA11F-A 3.5 x 35mm ACOG Advanced Combat Optical Gunsights hit fast in any light. Trijicon ACOG 3.5 x 35 Riflescopes are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using fiber optics which collect ambient light. Trijicon 3.5x35 ACOGs combine traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. Although Trijicon ACOG 3.5 x 35 Rifle Scopes TA-11F have many features which are very advantageous for military use, they were developed by Trijicon without government funding. Designed for use with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions - without failure-prone batteries.
