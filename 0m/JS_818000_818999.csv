I believe the serial number puts it at a 1998 manufacture date. The gun is in very good condition. There are light handling marks on the slide but nothing too significant. This is an early model that does not have checkering on the front strap (see photo). It's not exactly rare but not as common as the checkered ones.

It includes two very nice holsters. One is a High Noon Holsters Public secret that sells for about $100. The other is a Blackhawk CQC paddle holster that sells for about $50.
The gun also has XS Express Big Dot tritium night sights installed (about $100). It also includes three Glock factory 10-round magazines. One has a standard floorplate and the other two have Pearce PG-26 finger extensions. I can replace the Air Force slide plate cover with the factory one or leave it on.

This gun is great. I've carried it some and shot it some. I used it to qualify for my concealed carry permit. I've never had any issues with it. This is a nice concealed carry package.

I do want to go to an FFL to transfer the pistol. I am a member at the Bullet Hole in La Vista and they charge $20. This cost is included in the price.

I have put about 60 rounds through this lower and have the box and all original paperwork that came with it.  

The trigger is a $250 upgrade and the stock is $110 alone!!!

The Elite Complete Lower features a JP trigger for perfectly crisp, precise break and extremely short reset. The complete absence of take-up and over-travel gives the best combination of speed and precision on the market. The ambidextrous safety allows you to flip off the safety on either side of the weapon. The rugged Vltor IMod stock has a comfortable cheek weld with a removable non-slip butt pad. Each side compartment of the stock can hold two AA or three lithium CR123 3-volt batteries and accepts a push-button, quick detachable sling swivel. The Ergo grip is solid and comfortable. Its superior texture reduces slippage, even while wearing gloves, and it is virtually impervious to oils and solvents.

The main body of the scope is a 30mm hard alloy tube that provides added strength and light transmission over one inch riflescopes.
The lenses are coated ETE Microlux coatings, which allow maximum light transmission to your eyes so you see the target faster, clearer and with more contrast.
The Adjustments are Target style, to adjust simply pull out gently and turn to the desired setting. Push down again to lock. You can also return the dial setting to Zero with out special tools so you can be ready in the field to accurately compensate as required for both windage and elevation.
All Targetmaster riflescopes feature Side Parallax and focus adjustment. This is easily achieved in with the side adjustments compared to objective adjusting riflescopes. Also located on the side is the switch for the illumination of the reticle. This looks much neater and allows quick adjustments in the field. Fast focus eyepieces allow you to adjust the scope to suit your eye strength.
All Targetmaster riflescopes are supplied with a 100mm sunshade and you can choose one of the optional large wheels that suit your needs. Either 100mm or 150mm diameter. Dust Coves are also supplied.

1) ALL now feature 1:7 twist barrels! As always, they are all chrome-lined of course.

2) For versatility with different sling mounts, we now utilize the Vtac padded sling, though the MS3 is still available on request.

3) The Level-2, 3, and Signature rifles now feature the lower receiver normally only available in our ""Series 13"" line. Mil-spec, forged 7075-T6 as well, but with a very slick hardcoat, and the trigger guard machined in as one piece for greater torsional strength.



$250 down starts the build of your choice!



Ask about our fast-track option for Level-1 and ""SS"" carbines!



All of our rifles come with a LIFETIME warranty/service pkg. All rifles feature forged 7075 T6 upper/lower receivers, all mil-spec, chrome-lined barrel in .223/5.56NATO chamber, 30rd mag, Magpul stock, H-buffer, and BCM Gunfighter charging handle! Add an Aimpoint PRO optic, mounted & zeroed to any rifle for $425! (Excluding the ""Signature"" model, as it is already equipped.). ""RTA"" rifles.



The ""RTA"" rifles start with the Level-1+ carbine, tuned bcg, Magpul stock, H-buffer, Gunfighter charging handle, and Detachable Carry Handle rear sight. $1,395

The ""Level2 RTA"" bolt is upgraded with BCM extractor spring, and firing pin. It also gets a full Magpul furniture upgrade, including the pistol grip, MOE hand-guards, and vertical grip. This pkg is $1,525.

""Level3 RTA"" gets into the more highly tuned systems. The 14.5"" barrel shortens the post-gasblock dwell, softening the cycle of the bolt, and creating a smoother, flatter running rifle. Faster, more accurate follow-up shots. It's full-auto-spec BCG is further upgraded with the full BCM SOPMOD kit. It is also fitted with a StreamLight PT LED, MI Gen2 quadrails, RVG, Magpul textured rail panels, and S/P sling mount. $1,795

Our ""Signature RTA"" is based on my personal trunk-gun. It is the ""Level3"" in essense, only with std M4 handguards instead of rails, adapted to accept the StreamLight. It is also fitted with our custom single-stage trigger(your choice of 3.5 or 4lb pull) a .7"" enhanced butt-stock pad, QD single point sling mount, Vtac padded sling, and topped off with the Aimpoint PRO 2MOA optic. This is $2,295.





***NEW MODEL***



""SS-RTA"" The ""SS"" stands for ""Signature Stripper"". This is our immensely popular Signature rifle, without the added accessories. It is equipped with a standard mil-spec trigger, otherwise all the same internal components. This is a great, well balanced platform to start with, that can be enjoyed as-is, or added to as you wish. $1,695

This is freakin crazy! We need to stop this insanity! 

We are supposed to be Brothers in Arms not a bunch of money hungry price gougers! The prices people are asking and paying for firearms and ammo is insane! The government hasn’t made any laws, they are just proposing them. What is going to happen if they actually do enact any gun control legislation? 

I want you to know that I have a full understanding of how supply and demand works. I also know quite a few FFL's and yes distributors are out of stock of almost everything! However neither the distributors or manufacturers have raised their prices nor do they intent to! They are also working hard and fast to fulfill orders during this time of extremely high demand.  

Ask yourself has corporate America i.e.: Wal-Mart, Academy, Bass Pro or Cabela's raised their prices? No they haven't. It is the individual seller and the small retailer that is screwing all of us! It is the same thing that we all bitch about when we feel that Wall Street, the oil companies and big business are sticking it to us!

It is time for all of us to band together, invite and educate others to join us in the fight of our lives to protect the 2nd Amendment. Join the NRA, Gun Owner's of America, The Firearms Coalition, Texas State Rifle Association and other pro-gun organizations in stopping the government from threatening  before it is too late!"

The Kestrel 4500NV Weather Meter with Horus Ballistics combines Kestrel's flagship mete with Horus ATrag Ballistics software to bring you the first lightweight, hand-held tool to give you both comprehensive environmental data plus integrated aiming solutions. Kestrel Pocket Weather Meters and Horus Vision partnered to provide a powerful shooting tool that combines the critical environmental data and targeting software solutions required for precision shooting.

This gorgeous pre-64 Model 70 Super Grade 30-06, Ser No xxx064, once belonged to my good friend Bob Milek. Bob is best known as the Handgun Editor for Guns and Ammo Magazine, but Bob loved rifles, too...especially Winchester Model 70's. I traded Bob out of this rifle in 1992, about a year before he passed away, and it has been in my safe ever since. The rifle is absolutely beautiful, in 95-98% condition, and retains 99% of the original bluing. The stock is beautifully figured American Black Walnut with cut checkering and a special order hand-rubbed lacquer finish. The rifle has spent the past 50 plus years in a gun safe and is still in near new condition. It has had fewer than 100 rounds down the barrel, so the bore is clean and crisp, in like new condition and the gun has not been fired at all since it has been in my collection. This rifle also has a rare barrel stamp that makes it a ""must have"" for any Winchester collection. Please email me for additional photos. Comes with the original fixed 4x Weaver scope and one piece mount, also like new."

I have sold the P7, I still have 4 magazines available. I only accept PO Money orders, no PayPal due to them not accepting firearm/accessory transactions.

An ill individual whom I believe should not own firearms contacted me and immediately became hostile towards me due to me not accepting PayPal and called me a scammer and allegedly flagged this post as a scam. I have a 100% positive feedback rating on HKPro.com where I also have this post listed. I do not accept PayPal as it could shut my account down due to the aforementioned reasons.

The only numbers I can find on it is on the underside of the trigger guard that read: 49443. It also has front adjustable sites and is fairly light.

The WASR is in excellent condition, only 60 rounds through it. No issues with it whatsoever. It has a folding stock, sling, a steel 30 round mag, a poly 20 round mag, threaded barrel, has an AR style flash hider installed, and a G2 trigger group. Also comes with 2 other wood rear stocks, another lower hand guard, gas tube cleaner, and front sight tool. Probably forgetting something but anything that I have related to it will  go in the trade, including a small amount of ammo.

The 22 must be magazine fed and semi-auto. It doesn't have to include high cap mags but must have some available in the market. Must be in excellent condition.

Also, will not take less then $250 with trade, so if you feel $250 is too much, keep on looking.

Lastly, I'm not looking to travel too far. Will meet halfway but if I have multiple offers, will choose the closest and/or more convenient for me.
