Item/set-up was taken out of my Chevy Suburban. In Full working order with exception of a 12vdc neon tube inside the enclosure (can be replaced with ease and minimal cost). Also including remote Bass Boost module for the amp (lighted knob kind), - you will need a double mono 1/8 end cable to plug it in . As you see, there was no expense spared on this stereo (everything was purchased BRAND NEW), Amp was $800 shipped, Enclosure was $750+$150 shipping due to size/weight and capacitor was $200. So, not including all the terminals and wires, spare fuse and Bass Boost module This set-up was $1900. As you see from the pics, there are over $120 in wires and high end voltage distribution hardware. I ran this set-up via 0ga DC cables, second dedicated Optima Yellow Top Battery with upgraded to 130AMP Bosch alternator and Battery Isolator (none listed are included) as this is a power house and, obviously draws some juice. Capacitor helps big time, thus was added into the initial installation mix from the beginning and proved to be a huge value. Any questions, shoot me an email."

Three of them are police duty holsters and one is a Blackhawk Serpa holster.

(1)Basketweave Leather Safariland ALS(level 3) for HK P2000.  This holster is in great shape with barely any wear.  It has the hood, hood guard, and pressure sentry button after you release the hood.  I am asking $65.00 cash.  
(2)STX Tactical black Safariland ALS(level 3) for HK P2000.  This holster is the hard poly-material made to use with a tac-light.  It has the same safety features as the one above.  I am not sure which all tac-lights work on it but I used a TLR1 with it.  I am asking $50.00 cash.
(3)Basketweave Leather Safariland SLS(level 2) for Springfield XD40.  The holster is in good shape but has some wear.  This model has the hood and hood guard but no pressure sentry button.  I am asking $40.00 cash
(4) Blackhawk Serpa paddle holster for HK P2000.  $15.00 cash  

These are all right handed holsters that I personally own and have used on duty.  They are good holsters and the prices are firm because each of theses duty holsters cost well over $100 a piece.  If someone wants to buy all three of the HK P2000 holsters together, I will sell them for $110 total.  That is a good price because the leather ALS holster cost around $150 new.  If interested, call or text me at REDACTED.  I live in the Hoover area and could meet anywhere close."

For any collectors out there you know just how rare this rifle is. Barely 100k rifles made across 6 years of WW2. This variant is a 1943 model. This is basically the Hungarian M35 that was modified to the specifications of Germany. It fires the 8x57 Mauser cartridge, accepts K98 bayonets, and some other minor details. Has the right petina, has the factory rear sight leaf adjuster (very hard to find, most broke and were swapped with K98 sight adjusters). Bore is okay, a little fuzzy but it shoots straight as an arrow. Very few of these left, this one has a lot of character including a name carved in the stock, it's in service grade condition, just like I like them.

The 1911 RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS – which stands for 1911 Compact SAS – comes from the SIG SAUER® Customs Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a Natural Stainless (shown) or Nitron® finish the RCS comes with Novak® night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom wood grips. The grips are either gray diamondwood on the Stainless model or rosewood on the Nitron® version. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols features a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.

NO ammo with the rifle. I simply do not use the rifle. Too heavy to carry for deer hunting while hiking 14 or so miles.

 http://s978.photobucket.com/albums/ae270/guard87/870%20Custom/


For your consideration is a Remington 870 shotgun, built to outlast, outperform, and out-shoot all others, and with style. This 870 fires 2 3/4"" as well as 3"" Magnum loads. It can also carry up to 6+1 3"" shells. The barrel is a heavy walled Remington Police barrel, and the metal trigger guard, as well as the changing out of MIM parts help make this the most robust and reliable 870 available. This is a very solid and attractive shotgun, the Punisher engraving is very unique and quite fitting. The pictures don't do it justice. No pun intended :) It is equipped with the following:

*Receiver shell ejection side is inscribed/engraved with ""The Punisher"" in text and the famous Punisher skull. 
Filled in with white and silver long lasting color. It's not hard to guess what this shotgun's name is!

* 18.5"" Remington 870 Police barrel with Improved Cylinder bore and adjustable rifle sights.

* Custom fitted and permanently attached steel heat shield

*Trijicon 3 dot night sights (still light up well)

*Military grade synthetic ribbed forearm

*Remington Mariner/High polished nickle/chrome action tube assembly and forearm nut

*Remington Mariner/High polished nickle/chrome shell lifter.

*Chrome police bolt assembly

*Milled police grade extractor from Remington (this shotgun contains zero MIM (Molded injected metal) parts unlike the 870 Express shotguns

*Cast metal military/police grade trigger guard/assembly

*Drilled and tapped receiver

*EGW (Evolution Gun Works) Picatinny tactical rail is solid and made in the USA

* Tasco Red Dot Scope in perfect working condition with batteries

*Upgraded anti-walk trigger assembly pins that won't bump loose from recoil

*2-shot Remington Mag Tube extension

*Factory Mag tube extension barrel clamp

*Wilson combat extra power magazine spring for improved reliability

*Wilson Combat High Visibility magazine follower improves feeding and makes it easier to see that the magazine is empty.

*SpeedFeed III Tactical Magazine pistol grip stock holds a total of 4 2/34"" shells (2 on each side of stock)

*Sling swivel studs installed in stock and barrel clamp

*Also includes a custom modular quick detachable stock that allows you to quickly go from a Hogue pistol grip only- to a pistol grip with a stock with a comfortable angle for optimal sighting ability without the use of any tools. Its a highly adaptable stock system that is ready for anything. Stock has a shorter length of pull and works great for those wearing body armor.

*Includes factory Iron Sights if you so prefer to install them again in the future.

Mechanically this shotgun is pristine, the bore is bright and shiny, there is zero rust, and this is the most reliable shotgun you can get with such unique and incredible craftsmanship.

This add is for a used firearm and as such there are no returns. This must ship to an FFl dealer unless you are local and can provide pickup. Shipping is $30 I am only selling this shotgun out of my personal collection to free up some much needed cash. Thanks for looking and good luck!"

Need the cash so I'm willing to get creative with the package. $300 for the rifle, rings, bases, and factory ammo. $350 with all that and the reloading gear and the Simmons 8-point 3-9x mounted and boresighted. This is UBER rock bottom or I'll happily keep it. First responder gets it. Furthest I'll drive to meet is north Denver.

Well, bought this gun to hunt coyotes with but there's no way it'll replace my R-15 for that purpose. Not to mention it was my first gun reviewed for the site. It was literally broke in, sighted in then cleaned and put away where it's been since.

Here's the cost breakdown of everything new before tax:

Rifle - $300
3 Die Set - $30
2 boxes Hornady 58 grain moly custom varmint - $45
1 box Federal 100 grain soft point - $20
100 new unprimed brass - $20
1 box 100 ct Hornady 58 grain Vmax - $25
1 box 100 ct Nosler 70 grain Ballistic - $25
Savage rail bases - $10
Medium Height Rings - $15
Total - $490

There's a total of 10 rounds of the Federal left and 18 rounds of the Hornady left and all used brass is included. 30 rounds were loaded early on as a load test and never fired so there are 90 Nosler bullets left and 80 Hornady bullets left, and in turn the 70 new unprimed brass. The only thing not included in this setup that you see pictured is the Nikon Prostaff scope. 

Total cost AFTER tax was over $525, blah blah blah. Bottom line, I'm asking $400 for everything pictured (minus the Nikon) and for an extra $25 have a decent Simmons 8 Point 3-9x40 scope (bottom half of second picture) for a total of $425. Rifle comes with original box too. The rifle is PERFECT. If I had told you I hadn't shot it you would believe me, but there are approximately 22 rounds through it.

Here's the link to my FEEDBACK on the forum.

And here's the video review from February, apologies for the sucky audio, we've come a long way since then!

The Daniel Defense MFR 12.0 is a 12"" CNC Machined Modular Free Float Handguard. It is specifically designed to adequately cover a low profile gas block on a carbine or mid-length gas system barrel.

Make me an offer!!! 

The MFR 12.0 has been engineered to provide each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability. Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run “slick” with an unitterupted top rail that runs the length of the tube. In addition, the installation of Modular Picatinny Rails is accomplished with little effort. This allows you to have rails anywhere you need them and nowhere you don’t. 

The slim profile feature of the MFR 12.0 keeps the shooter’s support hand close to the bore which aids in firearm manipulation, and the design and construction allow for the attachment of Picatinny Rail Sections at standard 90 degree or offset angles.

I will only sell to a person legal to own this firearm. Must be of legal age and a Missouri resident. I will also provide a bill of sale showing I am the legal owner and it is not stolen. I will show you my ID, and ask you do the same.

Feel free to text or call me at REDACTED. 

Trades: I am looking for a good hunting rifle for my 10 year old son to attempt to take down his first deer with. I really like the Remington 700 youth in .243 but I am open to others. Please let me know what you have that is smaller, light, and less recoil. 

Will trade for: Youth rifle, Saiga's, Browning, nice 22's, etc. I prefer long guns over hand guns."

It's in good shape, but has some stickers on it as well as a marker drawing on the headstock that was there when I bought it. Haven't tried to remove it so I don't know if it will come off. The sticker's vinyl so it should peel off easy and clean up with a little Goo Gone or something similar. Has a good tone, and I've recorded a little bit with it playing acoustic. The electric hook up is built into the bottom strap button and there's a tone and volume knob up top where the neck meets the body. Haven't tried it in years and don't have an amp, but the last time I used it, it worked, though there was static when you adjusted the volume.
I'll throw in a heavy duty padded zip up case for it for an extra $20."
