I went to work one day and found a dog outside my warehouse.  He is a Lab/Pit Bull mix, and extremely friendly.  Me being the animal lover I am, took him home to try and find him a new home.  I do not have enough time as it is with a wife, job, two dogs, a cat, snake, and fish tank, so I do not have enough time to train him.  I have him outside in the fenced in backyard right now.  The reason I know so much about him is because I did some research on crags-list to see if he was lost, and found an add for the same dog for sale......same markings, same dog!  So apparently they dumped him because I contacted the individual and they said the dog was ""no longer available"".  He is good with kids, loves to run and play, just a very sweet dog for having put bull in him.  I don't care much for pit bulls, but just shows its how you raise a dog, not the breed.   I am giving him away to a GOOD home where he will get enough attention.  I will pay to neuter him if the new owner prefers to do so.  I have some food, dog bowls, and treats that will come with him as well!!  You can email me or call me at 803 7 six 0 8568.  Thanks for looking!"

The reason I am listing it so low is that there is one screw missing (shown in picture with arrow). It does not affect the overall performance of the knife. The other is the stop pin is not correct(shown in picture with arrow). When the knife is opened the knife has a little bit of play. Both of these are easily correctable but I don't know anyone who makes knives or who can order me the parts I need.

170,http://www.armslist.com/posts/694170,For Sale/Trade:  Navy Seal type RIB,"Smithfield, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina","$ 5,000","Listed On: Sunday, December 2, 2012",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The RIB is a 2009 Avon Rover 310 Lite, it is made of Hypalon and will last 30 years if taken care of. It is loaded with everything you need to hit the water., 2009 Mercury 9.9 motor, AS NEW, pump, oars, tank, everything. It is a BLAST !!! 
There’s a reason the Navy SEALS use Hypalon RIB’s as does the Coast Guard for rescue missions,,,,,they are TOUGH, they are nearly unsinkable and draft very little water. They can carry a ton of weight and go anywhere. This RIB can be carried to the water in it’s own bag. The floor is rigid so it’s very tough, easily beached without harm. I use this on local lakes and also down at the beach on the ICW and on nice days you can hit the open ocean !!! Fishing off the RIB is easy. You can go where no one else can, explore remote locations and beach at secluded beaches no one else can get to!
This set up was $5,520.00 new, WITHOUT THE TRAILER and used less than 15 times. This isn’t a cheap rubber raft, this RIB is for real.
Again, look at the Navy SEAL and Rescue boats, they use RIB’s !!!

I just bought a trailer to make transport even easier ! Then I customized it to also haul the Mercury 9.9 so as to avoid the hassle of putting it in the car trunk, the motor just mounts to the front of the trailer. 

Price is FIRM at $5,000.00, no less. I’m looking for a, GUN COLLECTION, a Harley or a crotch rocket type bike, I don’t want a metric cruiser unless it’s worth more than my RIB.

If the RIB is so great, why am I selling it ???? Simple, I want a BIGGER RIB and need to make room!!! So, it’s for sale/trade, as is my bigger hard boat also."

The LOP is 13 1/8” just right for someone shorter than average and can easily be extended using some nice Velcro slip on recoil pads or I use a PAST recoil pad in shirt sleeves then as is when wearing a lot of hunt clothing to give the same easy mount.

I am very firm at $475.  That is for a brand new in the box gun.  If used but like new, the price is $425 firm.  Prices for additional accessories that may come with it are as follows: additional magazines are $20 for 7 round, $25 for 8 round with extension, holsters vary depending on what it may or may not be (I may not even want it), ammo $10/box of 50 range stuff and $.50/round if good defense ammo (all ammo price depends on quantity), Crimson Trace laser $150.  If there's anything else then inform me what it is, details help, and it may or may not be worth something to me.  So all said, what's listed is what I am willing to pay.  

Honestly, I am looking for just a plain from the factory gun that's brand new in the box with the paper work and the factory 7 and 8 round magazines it comes with...which means regardless of what you might have, I may only be interested in the gun only or nothing at all even.

I am willing to meet face to face in a public location, like a Wal-Mart or Home Depot parking lot.  The location should be in the vicinity of Southwest-Southeast 270, Circleville, Lancaster, Grove City, Georgesville, Hillard, or Renoyldsburg.  Thought much outside of Grove City to Circleville area and the price starts falling (I work a lot and paid hourly, also get 10mpg...both add up fast). I think that's pretty much it. 

Offer what you want to me, the worst I can say is no...but I think I have it pretty well listed.  Thanks!"

This is an excellent gun with only about 50 rounds shot through it so its in perfect condition. Soon as I bought the gun I ran into some financial issues and now unfortunately I need the cash. The gun is a double to single action shooter with a decocker. It comes with two 15 round magazines which run about 40 bucks a piece and a laser that if you tried to buy alone would run around 80 bucks or more. There is a rail system below the barrel so you could detach the laser and mount just about anything. The sig 2022 is referred to as the sleeper sig becuase its polymer design allows it to be sold for much less than the SIG 229, but still maintains the accuracy and durability of the SIG franchise. This is the weapon of choice in the the french police force and was chosen over the glock 17 and 19 after field testing. Great gun.

Best way to check is to come take a look at em. Tires have one season on em, and about 4,000 miles, almost all tread remaining and still have the factory blue and yellow lines between the tread. Rims were coated this year and practically don't have a scuff on em. Great color scheme and very costly set up, already balanced, just need mounted.

You can see the visible characteristics that establish them as a pre-ban magazines, such as the ""U"" notch found in the very early models, and the caliber designation stamped midway between the top of the mag and the witness holes (after 9/13/94 Glock moved this to the top to fit ""Restricted - LE/GOVT Only"" below it....they never moved it back post ban).  I am asking for $86.00 plus $6.00 for shipping as I am located in Pittsburgh, PA.  These magazines are in good shape for their age.

It is not a picky eater at all when it comes time to buy ammo. I am very happy with the placement of the 80ish rds that I have fired thru it. This as an issue sidearm to MPD and of course there is some minor holster wear on it. I can assure you that there is not one thing wrong with it. Never had a ftf or fte while shooting and i do not expect it to malfuntion any time soon as long as it is oiled and cleaned properly like any other firearm. 
Also with this pistol I will throw in the the 15 rd mags and a really cool 30 rd may I picked up. I have a black safariland holster and a coyote thigh rig from TAG. 
Have the hard case with foam guts from the MPD armory as well.
I would like to get 550 for this pistol and extras as the gun alone is worth around 475 and the extras are going to set any one back 200 or so. I am open to trades and have had my eye on a glock 17. If it comes in FDE and some extra mags I promise you I will bring some boot to trade as well. I know what this pistol is worth and what they are worth new, and i can look at your pistol and can tell if you have fired more than 100 rds through so don't BS me. I would prefer you to be honest at tell me what you can about your trade.
Cash of course needs no history or background but I may inquire how you earn it as I seem to always be with out. I will consider other trades as well but mostly I just need money.

Also have an AR 15 I'm trying to sell/trade. Its about 5-8 postings below this one... let me know if you want to meet on a range and test fire a couple rds you are free to do so. 
Looking to get that Harley so if you have one or know somebody who has one in the garage collecting dust (like all my friends bikes sem to do) please let me know.
Call or text any time. If i don't pick up just leave a message and your call will be handled in the order it comes in.

This is a very nice shooting rifle that is modeled after the famous M1 in design. With a ramped rear sight and a grooved receiver, you can use the vintage style iron sights and do some plinking, or pop on a 3x9x40 scope and you are ready for some small game action! Includes (2) 7 round mags, approximately 500 rounds of ammo, and a brown soft gun case for free. I have ran approximately 750 rounds through this rifle, and it shoots very straight indeed! These rifles are no longer legal to import to the US because of a ban on them for some reason or another. The most famous Norinco product is their version of the SKS. In the .22LR, the bolt action JW-15 is fairly easy to come by, however finding the semi-auto version is quite rare. 

This gun shoots great, and I have taught my son to shoot on this rifle. The only small quirks that it does have is that sometimes the semi auto action will not catch the trigger when it cycles. This is remedied by slightly moving the trigger forward in between rounds so that it catches on the action. Also, the safety does not function. This is because the safety slide is held in place by the upper portion of the aluminum trigger group. There is a small piece of aluminium  that is broke off. I'm sure a gunsmith could repair this. However, I have not fixed it because I have always been taught to treat every gun as if it were loaded, and I have taught that same safety to my children.

I have priced this rifle in accordance to what I feel this gun is worth. However, I am open to offers, both on the price and on a trade. I am currently in the market for a 17HMR rifle or a semi auto pistol chambered in a .22LR. If you have something I'm looking for, I am willing to do a trade with cash as well.

Asking $125 or best offer.


Thanks for looking.
