This is an original ww2 rifle in excellent condition. It is a great shooter and one of my favorite rifles, unfortunately I am forced to sell. This is a C & R eligible gun, so no transfer fees are necessary, and you can take it home with you as soon as you pay.

About the rifle (from reference books, matched with the serial number):
It was manufactured in November of 1942 at the Remington typewriter factory in New York, New York. It was shipped out to the Marine Corps that month for use in New guniea and the Solomons. From there it traveled from island to island, hopping with the Marines through Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Guam, Tinian, Saipan, and Peleliu, seeing action on every one. Before Iwo Jima, they were replaced entirely by the M1 Carbine, except for a few in commando missions (not this one though). This rifle was then shipped back to the states for use in boot camp as marksmanship training rifle from 1944 to the end of the war. Then used as a drill rifle by all services. (from the fleck of white paint left on the stock, and the overall condition, my guess is that it was used by military police in Korea, not as a drill rifle.) That is up until 1955-56, where all M1903 rifles were re-collected, refurbished if necessary, re-parkerized if necessary, and then sold to retired WWII and Korean war vets as hunting rifles for $25.50."

I have the original box.
I bought the rifle on 12/23/11 from an individual who bought it from another individual.  He said that he was told the rifle had been shot very little.  He said that he had shot it very little as well.  I ran a couple of wet patches down the bore and put it in the safe.  My gunsmith bore scoped the rifle on 1/5/12.  He said the throat and rifling looked brand new.  I loaded 10 rounds with 73.0 grains of Hodgdon H4831SC powder, Federal no. 215 primers, and Sierra 180 grain MatchKings with a C.O.L. of 3.5 inches (which was .01” off of the lands and grooves).  The rounds loaded into the magazine. I used this recipe because it was what I had lying around.  I would have rather used Retumbo with 220 grain Berger VLDs.   I did everything to the brass except turn the necks.  I shot the rifle on 1/5/12 to make sure the scope tracked and to check accuracy.  It was pretty windy.  I shot one round from a cold, clean bore.  I then moved 8 clicks right and shot, 8 clicks down and shot, 8 clicks left and shot, and the 8 clicks up and shot (see photo).  I took a small break and looked at the target and marked it.  I also adjusted the scope.  I then shot 5 rounds.  The cold bore shot went a little high and left as did the first cold bore shot.  The other 4 shots went into a .32 inch group (see photo).  I was shooting at 100 yards.  Pretty impressive for just throwing some ammo together!
The rifle package is in excellent condition.  I will not part out the rifle as it is being sold as a complete package.  I am not hurting for money and am in no hurry to sell the rifle.    $2,400.00 plus actual shipping cost from my FFL to your FFL.  Email me at REDACTED if interested."

The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.

Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.

With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 - 8.5 pounds (27.5 - 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7N).

The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.

A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike.

Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system."

This is a first come first serve type of situation.... I WANT TO KEEP ONE OF THESE HANDGUNS, they both shoot so well and I really only ""need"" one of them.  So when you respond let me know which one you want.  This needs to be FTF, and I really only want to travel about an hour or so to do this.  I will require that the purchaser have Indiana ID, their Carry Permit, and be willing to sign a ""bill of sale"".

Up for sale are the HK USP 45 Tactical (at about 98% condition) OR the Sig 1911 Tactical Operations w/ Threaded Barrel (LNIB [fired 100 rounds]).  Both guns come with their original box, gun lock, and papers.  

The HK USP 45 Tac has Match Grade trigger and Barrel.  The trigger is crazy smooth with a little play in the beginning, but then very crisp at the break and it does have an over travel screw.  The Match Barrel is threaded and has an O-ring and is super reliable and accurate.  The USP also has tall adjustable night sights which are great, this thing is hitting pop cans consistently at 60 yards.  This USP comes with 2- 12 round magazines and a light adapter installed to allow for tac. lights being attached to the gun.  A great gun that is a perfect suppressor host, HD handgun, and range gun.

The Sig 1911 Tac Ops has become one of my favorites (it tied with the USP 45 Tac, so now I have to choose).  Sigs and 1911s are known for their accuracy, so when you combined the two, it is crazy accurate!!!!! This is an all steel 1911 with rail and threaded barrel (and magwell).  So it is slightly heavy than your regular 1911 (41.6oz compared to 35-38oz).  The gun comes standard with Sig Novak night sights, 4 (made by Checkmate) 8 round magazines, a removable steel magwell, and of course the threaded match barrel.  The trigger is really nice, obviously, its a 1911.  I had forgotten how fast you can shoot a 1911, 7 (if not all 8) rounds have been shot before the first casing hits the ground. Also a great gun that is a perfect suppressor host, HD handgun, and range gun.

Because of the type of sale this is, you must realize that one of these might sell quickly, if you want one of these let me know ASAP. Thanks"

My Jeep is in MINT condition. It just turned 38,000 miles and has been garage kept since bought new. It is Yellow and has a 3"" Sky Jacker lift kit. It has never been taken off road. The 4 wheel drive has only been used during the winter, on a few occasions. I have changed the oil every 3,000 miles or every 6 months as sometimes I did not put 3,000 miles on it in a 6 month period. I have always ran premium synthetic oil in it.

Here is a list of how it is equipped...

- A/C

- Hard Doors

- Vinyl top - in excellent condition

- AM/FM CD player

- Glass windows

- 5 speed

- Alcoa Aluminum wheels

- Front and rear brush guards

- Reese Hitch (not for towing - used for a luggage rack)

- Interior is flawless

- Nerf bars (to assist getting in/out)

Kelley Blue Book says the Jeep is worth $13,000.00 for excellent condition. My bank says the loan value is $13,100.00. Local car dealer offered $11,000.00 in a trade in. Of course he low balled me because he will put the Jeep on his lot for $13,900.00 or something like that.

Neither the bank or Kelley Blue Book has an option to value the lift kit. So, the prices above are not taking in consideration the lift kit.

Selling Price: $12,000.00

Up for sale is a 98% condition HK45c.  This gun is awesome, and very accurate for its size.  I bought it to be my carry gun, but found another gun to use instead.  It was only carried in soft leather so holster wear is minimal to non-existent.  The features of this 45c include a 4 inch match barrel with O-ring.  HK's match grade trigger system (without over travel screw).  Glow in the dark sights, which aren't true night sights, but I find them better than plain white dot sights.  2- 8 round magazines (USP 45c mags and HK45 [not USP45] mags will also work in this gun) with finger extensions are included.  The gun comes with the 2 magazines, the original box, gun lock, extra back strap, spent casing, and papers.

The main things I would be interested in traded for this would be a HK p2000sk 9mm LEM + cash, Waffen Werks ak74 + 300, or Arsenal SLR 105/Arsenal SGL 31 (ak74) + maybe small amount of cash depending of model."

Being that it's such a low recoiling round this scope hasn't seen any abuse other than getting raked across the occasional bush while panning the ground for sage rats. It's been replaced by a Nikon Monarch and sitting in a closet in my shop for the past 6 months. Holds zero well, and (for a Tasco) is a really decent little scope.

Paid $89 for it (opticsplanet.com) for it new, cheapest I can find now is $60 (ON AMAZON) so I'm asking less than half of what I originally paid at $40. This scope can be found new at Walmart.com for $79 also (http://www.walmart.com/ip/Tasco-Varmint-2-10-x-42-Scope-with-Mil-Dot-Matte/5684942) 

There's some wear around the turret caps, and a little on the barrel from the ring mounts, but other than that it's awesome. Functionally perfect, the lenses are flawless and it's packed in the original box. Would be a perfect scope for a little magnum rimfire or .22 rifle.

I'm in Greeley so anyone close by I'd appreciate you meeting me around here. If you're further I can go as far west as Loveland and as far south as Platteville to make the deal happen.

Since the introduction of Hornady’s new .17 caliber rimfire cartridge several months ago, the little hotshot has really caught on with shooters and varmint hunters. Besides Hornady, other ammo makers have now jumped aboard, and several companies are now making rifles chambered for the little seventeen.  Gunblast has been a proponent of the seventeen since its introduction. It has proven to be an accurate and flat-shooting cartridge, and works extremely well within its intended purpose.  The nay-sayers who predicted that it would not catch on are now eating the crow upon which the .17 HMR is so effective. The little .17 is here to stay."

For sale is a very nice Bushmaster M4 AR-15.
Rifle is chambered in .223/5.56 1/9 twist, and is the 16"" - ""heavy"" profile barrel. Forged upper with an A2 stock.
Rifle is in VERY good condition, like new.
All parts are authentic Bushmaster, with the exception of the stock which I believe is DPMS, as Bushmaster A2 stocks are impossible to find.

This is not your cheap AR with parts thrown together from different kits and different manufacturers to make the cheapest gun possible. This is a quality rifle with a big name to back it up.
Bayonet lug, flash hider, trapdoor stock.
I will include one new steel mag with purchase.

You will not find a better deal on this rifle. You may find a Bushmaster for less, but 99% of the time it will have a polymer (aka plastic) upper and/or lower....don't buy a plastic toy, buy the real deal.

This is a great rifle, however I'm looking to sell, so I can afford my other hobby's.

This is a great optic, but I find myself having a few too many aimpoints on hand at the moment.  This optic/mount combination lists for $615 new on Larue Tactical's website, so at the price of $475 shipped or local, you're getting a good deal.  Sorry, no trades.

The optic is in very good condition, with some very faint surface scratches in the glass that do not effect function.  Also has some light scratches and minor wear on the body. The rubber cover and flip up lens covers are included. To give full disclosure I'm just going to go ahead and say that the flip up caps have lost some of their ""springyness"".  Also, the rubber strap for the battery & adjustment knobs is missing, but can be replaced from optics planet's website for about $8.  So hey, at the very least this optic will make your rifle look a little less like a safe queen and more like something that's actually seen some use!  ;-)

The mount is an older version of the LT129 that does not have the locking lever and does not have ""Larue Tactical"" engraved on the underside.  However, I have discussed this with the folks at Larue over a phone call and they have assured me that this was perfectly normal on their earlier mounts from a few years back.  It has some scratches, especially on the spare battery holder, but is in very good working condition."

Rifle functions great, is very accurate and I’ve only had ammo related problems in the 1,500 rounds fired (i.e. cheap Russian ammo). I have no pressing need to sell, but I have become bored with ARs.  

Price is firm and fair. I'm selling about $600 worth of ammo, parts and gear with a rifle that would normally sell for >$700. 

Face to face in immediate Fort Collins area. Buyer must present a valid Colorado Driver’s License and sign a bill of sale (CHP/military/LEO preferred).

Cash only and no trades.
For an extra $50 I will throw some gear in:

- Specter buttstock magazine pouch (1 mag), black (MSRP $23.70)

It is all in great to like-new condition, and if you should go out and buy all this new today it would cost about $185.

250 rds American Eagle (Federal) 5.56 included for $30

In short you can buy the package and have everything you would need (minus CLP and cleaning patches) for the price of a new rifle with one magazine and maybe a sling and case."

DON'T JUST HUNT, AMBUSH!

Overview

No longer do you have to compromise weight for takedown power, now you can have both. The Ambush 6.8 is not only lightweight, it’s modular, utilizing a Picatinny Rail system and adjustable butt- stock to better suit your individual needs. While hunting with the Ambush 6.8 Mossy Oak® Break Up® Infinity™, you are the most silent, concealed, and mobile you've ever been. 

Details

From Black Creek, GA, Ambush Firearms™ debuts the premiere 6.8 SPC hunting rifle, delivering 6.8 takedown power in a package light enough for the most mobile hunter. Rifle manufacturers often overlook the shooting comfort of the hunter. At Ambush Firearms™ we have taken everything into consideration. The adjustable butt-stock gives another way to adjust the rifle to fit you, no matter your size or the clothes you’re wearing. To further augment the Ambush 6.8, we have included modular rail sections and an adjustable indexable foregrip, enhancing your natural shooting position. Outfitted with a Geissele Super Semi-Auto two-stage trigger to decrease rifle movement, the Ambush 6.8 realizes its superior accuracy to take 'em down in one shot. The Geissele SSA has a total pull weight of 4.5 lbs, 2.5 lbs on the first stage and 2 lbs on the second stage. The pull weights and sear engagement are non adjustable. The Ambush 6.8 features a monolithic upper rail platform allowing you to mount optics where they suit YOU best, not the rifle. The free-floating hand guard extends 12 inches protecting the barrel while giving you plenty of real estate for hand placement or accessories. This Ambush 6.8 is finished in Mossy Oak® Camo pattern ensuring the rifle will be heard, but never seen. We carefully researched and configured this rifle to suit the needs of modern hunters and with our lifetime guarantee, Ambush Firearms assures a hunting experience unlike any other. 

Ambush Firearms are manufactured by Daniel Defense.

The scope has been mounted on a top rail scope mount. The rifle also has a bipod mounted. This rifle has a railed gas block and will come with two magazines as well. The stock has a few knicks and dings but nothing major. This came from shooting on a bench. The gun has been fired very little and hasn't been fired since I mounted the scope.

I took this gun to Sons of Freedom today and had it professionally cleaned. The guy that cleaned it is a 1911 fan and he said that the internals looked really good and ""I'd be proud to own it"". 

This is one of the older QUALITY models. It does have some wear from being used from being carried. I traded for it and the guy I traded used this as his carry gun. It comes with a hard case, hard holster, and two mags (one 7rnd, one 8rnd). 

This is a shooter - not a safe queen. So, if you are looking for a really good quality 1911 with upgrades to shoot or carry - this is your gun.  

I listed a couple of days ago for best CASH offer and I've received lots of offers, but no one has actually looked at the gun. 

I want $550 for it or best close offer. The highest CASH offer I've received so far is $450, but it seems ridiculous to sell it to an auctioneer knowing that he's going to turn around and sell it for a lot more money to one of YOU! 

I did ask them in the shop about a trade offer I had on a like new GP100 and they said this gun is way more valuable than that. 

I will trade it for other handguns. Looking for nicer glocks, sigs, colts, HKs, Kahrs, etc. If needed, I can add cash or other guns or you can add cash to make trade fair. Send me your offer/s. Let's get this done.

Hello, selling a SIG p238 in mint condition that has never been fired. Beautiful two tone. I really dont want to sell this but need the money for an unexpected bill. The sig p238 is chambered in 380 and holds 6 in the mag. This sig has sig night sights on it the glow in the dark, pretty cool. Has 1911 style thumb safety and slide release. The manufacturing date puts it right at a year old. The gun also comes with case, manuel, cable lock, and 100 rounds of 380 white box ammo. No trades need the money, and wont sell without ammo, what will I do with it? let me know if you have any questions thanks."

The AR is not for sale outright, just trade.

What I have:

The Rock River is in perfect condition and is an M4 flat-top, 16"" barrel with Rock River's optional Tactical Carry Handle and 6 position adjustable stock. It has a sling, a nice 200 Lumen light mounted forward under the front sight, a BCM Gunfighter charging handle, and an Enidine Hydraulic Buffer installed to enhance reliability, reduce recoil and wear on the BCG. Round count on this rifle is approx 300 trouble-free rounds. This is a 100% factory-built rifle, not a home-made job.

I also have a hard case, approx one dozen AR mags and approx 1200 rds of 5.56/.223 ammo, and a new Rock River Hat I'll include based on the number of mags and ammo you include with your AK's.

What I'm Looking For:

Two Wood Stocked AK-47's. I only want plain-jane fixed stock AK's. I prefer wood but if you have the black plastic fixed stock version, I'll consider it. WASR's are fine as long as the sights are straight (not canted). Any other country of origin is OK, based on condition.

I'll match whatever ammo or mags you include based on my list above.

If you only have one AK that matched what I'm looking for, I'd do a deal of your AK and $550 cash for my Rock River.

I have pics of the Rock River and I'd expect pics of your AK's. I'm not looking for any other trades so unless you have the AK's I'm looking for, thanks for looking.

All trades need to be in Avon or Brownsburg."

    What I have here is a Kel-Tec P-11 9mm Pistol that I bought last month for a friend to shoot when we went to the range.  I guess he liked it so much, he bought one of his own.  Well, I already have one of these so I'm looking to let this one go.  I'd prefer to sell it for 260 cash but I am open to trade for a nice 357 Snub or a 38 Snub.  It's a great gun, low round count, ideal for concealed carry.


You get everything listed below :

Kel-Tec P-11 9mm Pistol
2 - 12 Round Magazines (One with pinky extension).
Large Hard Case
Holster (Will have info on this tonight).


Only trades I'll take are for 357 Snubs or 38 Snubs.  Price is pretty firm but take a shot and see if you hit something."

I recieved it today (1-6-12) only to find they sent me the wrong gun, a P9 (polymer frame). Now the frustration, and wait of having to send it back and have them send me the correct weapon....LOOMS over me.  I paid $714.00 (shp) +20 for transfer($ 734 total). I will sell this new (never fired), still in the shipping box it came in today, P9 for $685. No transfer fees, shipping, etc....    I am going to use the money to buy a new XDM45compact.  If you are interested, I will sell the two brand new holsters for $40 each also. One is BHB(Targua), the other is  Leather Paddle holster with detachable Paddle (Don Hume), to use as a belt slide also. These are specifically made for this gun.  If it is not sold by the time it takes them to send me back reverse shipping, I will send it back and wait. I figure by friday . REDACTED, 655-8271

The gun is in great shape, with just a bit of the finish flaking on circular handles towards the back. There is also a small V-shaped notch cut out on the top of the frame. This was likely the result of a previous owner dry firing the gun with the internals out; if this is done, the hammer can dent the frame. The V-shape looks to be intentionally cut and is less obvious than a misshapen chip, so it's really not very noticeable. 

Comes with vintage box, not numbered to gun, and reproduction of the manual.

The gun can be fussy when it comes to shooting. It seems to like Federal Lightning, but I do get light primer strikes sometimes. The firing pin is a new old-stock replacement."

Taken from the description on aim surplus website where I bought this upper from: 

""The Heart of the New ST Elite Mid-Length upper is the 14.5"" FN Cold Hammer Forged barrel with permanently attached Dynacomp Extreme. These Amazing CHF 1:7"" twist barrels are extremely durable with a 20,000+ round service life. These CHF barrels are turned to Spike's New Optimum barrel Profile. This profile is lighter than government profile but beefier than a lightweight profile.""

""The barrels utilize a Forged F-Marked A2 front sight base which is taper pinned to the barrel in the Mid-Length location.""

""The barrels have a .750"" gas block seat with a properly sized gas port and the muzzle is threaded concentric with 1/2x28 threads.""

""These barrels are made to the Mil-Spec for the M249 SAW. They are the correct Certified CMV material and they are also Hard Chrome lined to the M249 SAW Mil-Spec, which is almost 2X as thick as the Hard Chrome on a Mil-Spec M4.""

Each barrel is HPT and MPI and have a stainless melonite coated gas tube

They have Mil-Spec M4 barrel extensions, Mil-Spec Phosphate finish on the outside (under the front sight base as well).""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought this upper when they had plenty in stock, now they are currently sold out and they will not have any more for a while so get it here while you can. It is basically an FN Herstal M249 SAW barrel that was machined with an AR15 M4 barrel extension. I just picked up a 16"" upper and could really use some cash. I have put approx 200 rounds through this upper. Does not come with bcg or charging handle but will come with a buffer. You will not find these anywhere else for a while as I believe they just made a limited batch of them for AIM surplus.

I WANT CASH ONLY. Request for trades will be ignored. Only reason for selling is I need some quick cash and after the 9th of this month it wont matter anymore and this ad will be taken off.

The Following Info I have gotten from folks who are supposed to be experts
The arm really is a Model 1884! ""Model 1888"", while it had SOME contemporary usage is MOSTLY a term of modern collector convenience, to indicate the final version of the rod-bayonet. 
Now, there WERE 100 rifles (noted as having a ""positive cam"") actually marked ""U.S. Model 1888"" but they were experimental only - having a modification to the locking mechanism - they occur in the 4155xx range, and must not be confused with the normal rod-bayonet rifles, of which over 60,000 were produced.
