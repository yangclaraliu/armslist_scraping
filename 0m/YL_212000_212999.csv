Perfect for those who don't already own a CTR.
 It's a fact that some AR's need a cheek riser to get proper cheek weld for raised scopes or rifles with raised rails. It's another fact that standard AR charging handles require a lot of travel, making it impossible to charge a rifle without moving a collapsible stock all the way to the rear. The LaRue RISR solves these problems. 

Made in Texas, USA, out of glass-reinforced polymer, the RISR is spring-loaded, and travels to the rear as the charging handle is moved to the rear. When the charging handle is released, the RISR snaps forward. Designed to fit the excellent Magpul CTR butt stock without modification, the RISR only takes a few minutes to install with a phillips-head screwdriver."

This is the real deal full size pinball, not a half size or plastic pinball for kids.
This machine is very unique and fun to play; as it has a spinner that spins and gives you a random bonus when the ball lands in the bonus slot.
The machine is in good condition and works great. No broken or cracked plastics. There is some wear to the playfield and cabinet which is expected (if there wasn't it was probably repainted and not original). The backglass does have some flaking in spots, but shouldn't get any worse as it was clear coated with the proper sealer.
The rubber rings and ball were replaced a few years ago, and the playfield was cleaned and triple waxed at that time as well. I believe all the lights work (I will include a few bulbs if there are some burnt out).
In 1970 there were two almost identical machines made: Rock n Roll and Jive Time. The Rock n Roll was the rarer of the two machines as it was the ""add-a-ball"" version. Add-a-ball games were built for the few states that banned gambling (Wisconsin was one of those few states), as at that time ""winning"" a free game by matching your final score to a randomly picked number, was considered gambling. Not many of these machines were produced and even fewer survived until today.
Currently the machine is set-up for free play. There are no locks or keys with the machine (I will install a new front door lock and key for an additional $15).
I will included an original Jive Time owners manual to whoever buys the machine.

Asking $550 cash.
Contact me at REDACTED (no emails, I get to many phony emails).

Will help take apart and move.
Actual pictures of the machine for sale are listed on the internet pinball database link below:

I've had this rifle for two years and enjoy it, but thoughts of trying something else have entered my mind; so why not put it up and see what happens.  Rifle, mags, cleaning kit, and bipod go together, scope and riser available, but not a must.  I DON'T HAVE TO SELL- and your offers should take that into consideration.  I'm asking $1300 for the rifle and all listed accesories without the scope and rail riser; $1700 for all.
Rifle alone was $1400 new and as a package I have $2100 in it.

All in all has been pretty well cared for. It was a hunting gun, so it was cleaned after use. No rust on it at all.

In accordance with state and federal laws, there will be a bill of sale. FOID card required for Illinois residents. If from Iowa or Wisconsin, CCW permit or permit to acquire, please. Nothing against ya, just want to be sure that I am selling to a legal and responsible person. 24 hour wait period as required by law. To state in another way....once the gun is declared sold we will both wait 24 hours before the items/funds and the shotgun  change ownership. This will give appropriate time to make a detailed bill of sale. Any questions, just ask. I'd be more than happy to answer them.

I do have pictures available, and will send them to those who make serious inquiries. Thanks for looking.

it comes with a custom 4 cavity NOE 368 280gr fn mold that has only cast around 100 boolits, a set of hornady dies, over a box of speer 270 gr bullets, and 18 rounds of ammo loaded with my favorite load. (load data is on the box) i have a few more pieces of brass around here that i would just throw in with it. the stock looks to be refinished. the bluing is excellent. i have not gotten to shoot any of the cast bullets from this rifle.

the only wear is on the bow of the trigger guard from hunting. 
i'm asking $700 for the rifle and the entire lot of accessories. IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOLD, I'LL DROP THE PRICE TO $625. please feel free to ask any questions or for more pics. i might be interested in partial trades, but i need cash for christmas. i am looking for either a 93/95 mauser action or a 98 turk action. (or entire rifles). i might be interested in a partial trade of rifles in odd cartridges, project rifles, etc. make me an offer, the worst i can do is say no.

i figured my price as follows: rifle $500, dies $50, mold/top punch/lyman size die $100, bullets $25, brass/ammo $25, grand total of $700"

This is probably the most accurate handgun I've ever fired. It has a very smooth double action trigger and a very crisp single action trigger, better than that on a CZ 75 or Sig 226. This thing makes it very easy to put all shots into one ragged hole at pistol distances, really easy to hit cans with at 50 yards, didn't go further than that. It also is the softest recoiling 9mm I've fired. This surprised me as it's very light weight....around 23 or 24 ounces I believe.

Price could be negotiable.

You can buy a centerfire upper for roughly $300 (9mm, .40, 357 Sig) . So for about $700, which is what most Sig 226s sell for anyway, you would be able to shot both calibers. 

Sorry the pictures aren't much. My phone was all I had to take them with. It is in excellent condition. Would get better pictures if I was shipping, but you would be able to check out before purchase.

I will consider partial trade of Keltec PF9, Ruger LCP, or Bersa/Firestorm .380. $400 is cash price. If trading, actual value of guns will be considered. New, the 226 .22 sells for $550. The PF9, LCP, and Bersa/Firestorm all less than $300. So if in comparable condition, I think $200 and any of these are fair.

I have a target Kimber conversion in silver. It has the target sights as well as the front and rear cocking serrations. These are very nice conversions that shoot very well. It has had a barrel extension professionally added and then threaded 1/2-28 concentric to the bore for use with a suppressor. The smith that did the work fired several magazines and it was 100% reliable with no baffle strikes. It is very straight thread job because my can has .234"" baffles and bullets pass through those baffles without issue. Most commercial suppressors use a .25"" or large baffle so this conversion will work without any worry of baffle strikes.

Round count is in the 300 round range total. It is by far the most accurate 22 pistol I have ever shot, with or without the suppressor. This conversion is 100% reliable with all bulk and supersonic ammo as well as with certain subsonics. The barrel is short enough that most bulk remains subsonic as well. 

I am asking $300. The conversion itself costs over $300.
[url]http://www.midwayusa.com/viewProduct...tNumber=864181[/url]
Getting the barrel extension added and then threaded was another $100. It does not include the receiver in the pictures, only the conversion. The conversion will come with a stainless thread protector, factory box with all paperwork, a magazine as wel as an additional silver barrel bushing. If you don't like this style of thread protector I will make the buyer any kind of thread protector that he wants for free.

If you are in the Knoxville area you are more than welcome to shoot it. 

If you have any questions at all feel free to ask."

The instruction booklet didn't have any identifiers except ""D-TG-IS-03, Delta OEM LLC, 2008"". Even Mossberg won't spill the beans when I called, they just replied ""we supplied the scope with the rifle. We have a confidentiality agreement with the manufacturer"". After posting the pic on 2 web forums, the overwhelming majority concluded that it's a Bushnell Banner model scope, sans the markings and distinctive ""B"" windage caps. 

That being said, this was used to sight in the barrel and has 12 shots under it (set to 100 yds). It has adjustable magnification from 3x to 9x with a 40mm objective lens. The click adjustment is 1/4 MOA (each click moves the strike of the round 1/4"" at 100 yards) for both elevation and windage. It has 2 bungeed caps, the rear cup being amber color for clearer vision. 

I learned to shoot with the mil dot system, so crosshairs just irritate me. My mil dot went on and this came off. It's essentially brand new. No dings, nicks, scratches, etc.

Taught by active, full time Police Officer
Teaching CCH since 2007

I have real-world experience and teach from that perspective. I add to the basic curriculum to help better prepare students for the challenges of concealed carry and the
potential use of deadly force.

We cover CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Armed Response / Self Defense, Interaction with Law Enforcement and much more.

This is an excellent class taught by a knowledgeable instructor with a bit more than the AG CCH Instructor certification.

Full Time Police Officer
Certified CCH Instructor
NRA Instructor
Self Defense / Armed Response Instructor
Taser Instructor
30 years of experience

Many instructors base there classes on things learned in books and pseudo tactical as seen on TV
My instruction is based on proven and experienced technique and instruction

If you are considering a CCH class just ask yourself: Do you want to learn from someone with true experience in armed conflict, or a used car salesman who decided to teach CCH?

I have the opportunity to interact with many CCH holders and have found that many times the information they received was inaccurate and sometimes dangerous.

I believe in CCH and that is why I teach. IF you are wanted to carry a firearm, just be sure you ask questions of your instructor; their philosophy and true credentials. It is easy to become a CCH instructor, but it takes experience in armed conflict to offer what is really required.

I have a Ruger SP101 with a 3” barrel up for trade. I love this gun. It is my everyday carry gun. In fact, I love it so much that I bought a second one for the wife. Unfortunately, she didn’t like it at all so I’d like to trade it. I also have a recently purchased Rock Island Armory 1911 with a bright, shiny nickel finish. What I want is to either trade the Ruger straight up for another handgun or trade both the Ruger and the Rock for a Sig 1911. I will NOT trade the 1911 alone. I’m only interested in handguns and only .45 auto or .357 magnum. I suppose I might do a 9mm for the wife but not likely. I’d prefer to do this trade with a CCW permit holder. I’m most interested in a Star Megastar, a GP100, a Beretta 84fs, a full size P250 or a Glock 21. Since I am not interested in selling either gun outright, I will not be responding to any emails asking how much I want for them. I have no interest in anything from Taurus or Kel-Tec. Thanks."

I am a CCH Instructor (since 2007) and a full time police officer. In teaching CCH classes, I have seen the need for a more advanced curriculum that goes beyond the CCH law and teaches how to apply CCH to your life - meaning how to effectively carry a handgun (types of carry, options, choices), types of handguns available and why you would choose a particular type, how to deploy a handgun under stress and how to make that choice.

I touch on these topics in my CCH classes, but this curriculum is designed to offer much more detail and hands-on exercises to help you as a CCH holder.

It's not enough to get your license and go to the target range. To be effective in armed defense, you need to skills and knowledge to be effective without being a liability.

I have created this course based on training and experience as both an instructor and law enforcement officer.

In this 4-hour course, you will learn:

Weapon and Holster Selection
Ammunition Choices and Philosophy
The Stages of the Draw
The Importance of Trigger Control and Fundamentals
The Adrenaline Effect
Use of Cover and Movement
Less Lethal Options
Threat Detection, Avoidance and Confrontation
Use of Force - Legal and Moral Issues
The After Effect of combative encounters

This class consists of presentations as well as hands-on exercises. I use the SIRT training pistol as well as simulated non-firing replicas as part of this training regime.
I consider this information to be a 'must have' for anyone carrying or considering carrying a handgun. The state CCH course only goes so far. This is the additional training and information that you need.

Classes forming now, with the next scheduled to be November 12, 2011 (one week after my next CCH class).

Feel free to email with questions or call Six Five Five Six Four Six One just about any time...

Thanks to looking!"

I've added a base on the magazine that extends the grip and a slip-on grip build-up.  Both are easily removed. Comes with the box and the magazine.  $200 seems fair and I will hold on to it if someone can't provide pay that much.  

I bought it new in 2010.  It's been taking up space in my safe since then.  I bet I shot it a few times the first week I had it - maybe 100 times.  

I bought to carry but I've always been a 1911 man and small pistols aren't my bag I've come to realize.  

Did I mention the price is firm?  I should have if I didn't already.  Also, I'm a good law-abiding kind of guy, so I feel real comfortable selling this gun to someone who will simply shake my hand, hand me $200 cash and show me a carry permit.  If you don't have a carry permit, feel free have me walk into the FFL of your choice in Nashville, and we can do the transaction.  

I look forward to hearing from a serious buyer who's looking for a good compact pistol to carry."

24” Pac-Nor fluted barrel, Remington 700 short action. Barreled action done by Leo Schnell. Iron Brigade Armory bedded the barreled action into the McMillan stock.  Iron Brigade trigger guard. Iron Brigade Armory 20 MOA tapered base & rings. Badger bolt handle. McMillan A5 stock w/ adjustable cheek piece. Sling loops. Currently shooting the 162 AMAX bullet. 149 total rounds down the barrel (that includes break-in).  Bullet speed is only 2762 fps so it’s not even breathing hard - with a 100 yd zero the MOA drop at 1000 yds is ~27 MOA (~5400’ elevation). There is A LOT more room to step up the powder charge and get it closer to 3000 fps and hit another accuracy node. The charge was kept low to let the BC of the bullet (.624) do the work and save barrel life.  Last time I had it out earlier this summer I shot 10-12 rounds and was hitting ¾ size clay pigeons at 800 yds, it’s a VERY accurate rifle. I’m getting out of 7mm is the only reason I’m selling  it. I have a couple of “go-to” rifles in the safe and this is one of them, a proven, accurate shooter.  Funds go towards another project rifle. Lots of little goodies included, bullets, cases, dies.
There is some hangar rash from the bolt handle getting rubbed against other rifles in the safe. It’s not pretty. There is also some rash on the bottom of the trigger guard also a couple of marks on the barrel . Pics of the rash included.
