22cal (short or long), No one in the family can remember shooting it and with Grandpa gone now, it's hard to tell the last time it was fired. Everything seems fine functionally. Blue finish is excellent and there is some ""age spots"" on the nickle frame. Gun is in OUTSTANDING condition as it was a ""boy's rifle"" and not many survived the seasons of youth. About 50,000 were made prior to the 1920's and this is an exceptional piece. It is a TAKE-DOWN model though it is short and light now.

There is nowhere to shoot around here where I can appreciate the .260's abilities. I had a 300-yard range, and they got shut down. LAME! I live in High Point, NC. 

My rifle began life as a left-handed Remington m700 SPS-Varmint in .308. I removed the barrel and stock and sent the action to Montana Rifleman to re-barreled in .260 and have the action squared and the lugs lapped. I chose a #8 heavy match barrel that tapers from 1.25"" to 1"" at the muzzle, so one step below a bull barrel. Barrel is 24"" with a 1 in 8.5 twist. I added a Badger Recoil lug and MR also removed the factory bluing. 

Next I Duracoated the whole barreled action in Tactical Black. That is their non-reflective black finish. The nice thing about Duracoat is that if you hate the color I chose, you just paint over it and your metal protection factor improves. 

For the stock I went with a Manners T-4 non-adjustable. The stock is fantastic quality and if you run out of ammo, you have a highly effective club to use. Bottom metal is stock Remington with a MagXtender which makes capacity 7 rounds in the box. 

Next I went to the glass aisle and ordered a Falcon Menace 4-14x Front Focal Plane (FFP) tactical scope. It has target turrets and their ""ESLR"" mil dot reticle. The scope is attached by an EGW one-piece rail and Burris Signature Zee rings (two screw model). I have Butler Creek flip-ups on the scope. 

No trigger work was ever done as none of the custom trigger guys will own up to having a left-hand model. Timney used to, so if you can find one good luck. I think the X-mark is fine in my unscientific opinion, but I'm not a connoisseur. Safety is intact and working. 

I have maybe 130 rounds down the tube, period. Hardly broken in, but shoots well even in my amateur hands. Anyone Interested? 

Will so $1,700 without scope/rings and $2,000 with scope and rings.  Package would include a Hardigg Storm iM3300 case, Dewey rod, Lucas bore guide, brushes/jags, etc., and you can have all of my .260 ammo. Send me an e-mail address for pics/ammo inventory.

Countless hours of development and testing have led us to create a line of tactical scopes specially engineered. With these scopes, there is no need to guess what the proper holdover on a target is. You simply range your target and dial in the scope for that distance. We designed these scopes using an average of the most popular loads for each caliber. These durable scopes meet our stringent quality-control standards and have superior fully coated optics, better light transmission and greater resolution. No other scope will, however, match the versatility these scopes feature. Mounting tube is 1"". Finger-adjustable windage and elevation with trajectory compensation turret. Each scope is waterproof, fogproof and shockproof. The Centerfire features seven turrets in popular varmint/predator calibers for sighting systems incrementally calibrated to adjust for bullet drop out to 400 yards and beyond"

Countless hours of development and testing have led us to create a line of tactical scopes specially engineered for rifles in several calibers. With these scopes, there is no need to guess what the proper holdover on a target is. You simply range your target and dial in the scope for that distance. We designed these scopes using an average of the most popular loads for each caliber. Each scope comes with interchangeable turrets for different calibers that can be changed with an allen wrench. These durable scopes meet our stringent quality-control standards and have superior fully coated optics, better light transmission and greater resolution. No other scope will, however, match the versatility these scopes feature. Mounting tube is 1"". Finger-adjustable windage and elevation with trajectory compensation turret. Each scope is available in four power models with some models featuring a side focus parallax adjustment for ultrafast target acquisition. Each scope is waterproof, fogproof and shockproof. Each scope includes turrets, turret carrying bag and an allen wrench. The Centerfire features seven turrets in popular varmint/predator calibers for sighting systems incrementally calibrated to adjust for bullet drop out to 400 yards and beyond. 
Includes: .223 50-grain, .223 55-grain, .223 60-grain, .204 32-grain, .204 40-grain, .22-250 50-grain, .22-250 55-grain

Star model B
9mm automatic based upon the 1911, but with a narrower frame and no grip safety.
Adjustable rear sight and full length 5"" barrel.
Blued steel.
Military style spur hammer.
Checkered brown plastic grips.
Magazine safety was removed by prior owner.
Original factory 8 rd magazine and cleaning rod.
Comes with an extra firing pin and a Zoom ""snap cap"".

I really like the design of this pistol, and assumed it would be the perfect gun for me. Paid $375 for this pistol last month, sight unseen, as it had been represented to me as being in ""excellent condition with 98% finish."" I would call it ""very good"" condition with maybe 90% finish.

I've heard the Star model B is extremely reliable. This one had 3 stovepipes in 40 rds using Remington FMJ.  This is a Spanish pistol, and it is possible the Remington wasn't loaded hot enough. It may be due to the magazine spring, as each jam was the final round in the mag. Triple K makes a replacement magazine for this pistol which might eliminate this problem. I would also recommend replacing the extractor, just to make sure all bases are covered.  I'm not a gunsmith and I don't have the time or inclination to play with it until it runs 100%.  Pistol is extremely accurate. All rounds made a very tight grouping at 30 ft.

Pistol came with an ""extra magazine"" . . . but it was for the other Star the seller had (BM) and does not fit . . . but you can sell it to someone who has a BM for $30 or so.

Pistol fires and functions well, but reliability is not up to my standards and I don't want to waste the time and expense experimenting with different magazines, etc. There are two things you need to know about this pistol. First, it should never be fired without a snap cap (provided) or the firing pin may be damaged (extra provided). Also, because it is an antique, high pressure +P ammo should probably be avoided.

I had originally intended to invest in extra magazines and custom grips but I've decided to sell it at a loss instead.

This pistol, in my opinion, is not worth the $375 I paid for it (even though I've never seen adjustable sights on a model B before). I'd estimate its worth to be closer to $250. I'm asking $200 CASH, or I'd be willing to swap for a quantity of decent 9mm ammunition."

Really rare and unique.  Excellent home defense ammo as the plastic core negates the over-penetration of FMJ and Hollowpoint ammo.  Used in German CQB situations since it has very low recoil to keep you on target and the previous ball ammo tended to ricochet when it hit cement walls.  Imported into the states a while back as practice ammo for indoor ranges as the plastic core wouldn't destroy the backstop.  Head stamp states 05 79, 05 is East German and 79 is the year of manufacture.

OK. I tried to sell on here before and it was a nightmare. So I made a few rules for myself.
1 The guns are for trade only. Don't ask me to sell. It's not gonna happen. I've done my research. I know what they sell for new and used.
2 I'm not driving half way across the state for a no show. If you want to trade. I will meet you within 30 mile of where I live. I live in Van Wert OH. I'm a member of a local gun range. So if you want to fire the guns off you can meet me here.

Don't ask me to put any cash in either. If I'm gonna shell out any money I'll just go buy a new 22. I just want an even trade. My 2 guns for a working 22 pistol."

Our two featured guns are a Glock 22 (.40 S&W) and a Kimber 84 (.308 Win). Both guns are simply fantastic, I've got special drawing tickets available for both of them. You don't even have to be there to win! We'll call you!

I have personally achieved 1 MOA with match ammo and a few well made, higher end rounds and i am sure this rifle can achieve more with a better shooter and some handloads. It wears a factory heavy barrel and the bore is in exceptional shape.  This rifle runs on a short stroke gas piston system and thus runs extremely clean and cool in the bolt. The whole rifle is constructed of high imact polymer less the moving parts. As a result, the entire firearm is a modular platform capable of being converted to almost any configuration.  The rifle comes with one factory 10 round mag, factory sling and a Tasco EXP 3-9x54. This scope is perfect for this rifle as the   oval objective lens on this EXP measures 54mm wide by 42mm high. This offers a superb field of view and exellent light transmission.

I have an Egyptian contract FN-49 with excellent overall metal, Shiny bore, excellent wood (appears to be aftermarket), and no import markings. Does not have the side mounted scope rail like the 30-06 versions. Someone has affixed an M14 style muzzle brake to the barrel, but is easily removable with a hex key & wrench. Original threads in tact under brake/supressor. I do not have the original muzzle cap.

I've put 160 rounds down the pipe without issue, Shoots very accurate groupings with the crap rommy ammo, cycles well on it 99% of the time but prefers brass cased ammo. it has always been maintained and well cleaned after shooting corrosive ammunition.

I also have a sealed tin of Romanian 8mm steel cased ammuntion, and a partial opened tin that will go with the rifle.

I would love to keep it, but I want something new to play with. So it's gotta go.

An SKS on a Dragnuv style stock. Numbers matching. Shoots 7.62x39. 150+ rounds of 7.62x 39 ammo on stripper clips. I believe some is AP. Just because it sticks to a magnet does not make it AP. I did however on some of the headstamps run across what I believe to be factual, reliable sources stating it was AP. 

So a summary of what the $1250 gets you.

1-SKS w/ Dragnuv stock. Original wood stock.
1- Intra Tec Tec-9. 2 High cap magazines, original box w/ paperwork.
1- Romanian WASR 10 AK-47.
40+ - Stripper clips
150+ - Rounds of 7.62x39 ammo
1- Mil. Surp ammo can.

Not wanting to separate. IF I was going to, I'd be looking for $450 on the SKS, $500 on the AK and $400 on the Tec 9.  So I'm offering them up here as a bulk package price. I'm definitely not going to separate them until theres been 0 interest in the package for two weeks. I'm not driving across the state for $1250. So if Bass Pro shops @ Cincinnati Mall is to far, thanks for looking. No one from a non-neighboring State to Ohio, CHL holders, Middletown Sportsman club members move to the head of the line. I can arrange a test fire @ my Clubs range tues-sun. $35 ahead of time paid via paypal for 10 rounds through each gun, if we work a deal the $35 is deducted from our negotiated price. If not, thats the ""tire kicker"" penalty, I keep the $35 for my time and ammo. Only shipping to an FFL. 

I've only got pic. of the Tec9. I'm going to edit this tomorrow when my camcorder gets off the charger and take more pictures. So check back. Thank you."

So, up for sale goes my old friend here. It's a Kimber Series 1 classic stainless. There are a few very minor imperfections, but at a glance, this pistol is in almost new condition. Comes with box and one 7 round blued magazine. If I can find the stainless mag that came with it, you can have it instead, but I'm in the middle of moving, and not sure I can find it. I still have the black plastic grips, and they will be on the gun when the buyer recieves it. If you want the OD green textured grips shown, you can have them for an extra $15. This gun is unmolested and has a beautiful trigger with about a 4.5 lb. pull and very little take up. One of the nicest factory set triggers you will ever find. Round count is unknown as I bought the gun used, but I would say by the condition of the pistol that it is well under 1000.
Price is $975.  Remember, this is a Series I, NOT a Series II.

An SKS on a Dragnuv style stock. Numbers matching. Shoots 7.62x39. 150+ rounds of 7.62x 39 ammo on stripper clips. I believe some is AP. Just because it sticks to a magnet does not make it AP. I did however on some of the headstamps run across what I believe to be factual, reliable sources stating it was AP. 

So a summary of what the $1250 gets you.

1-SKS w/ Dragnuv stock. Original wood stock.
1- Intra Tec Tec-9. 2 High cap magazines, original box w/ paperwork.
1- Romanian WASR 10 AK-47.
40+ - Stripper clips
150+ - Rounds of 7.62x39 ammo
1- Mil. Surp ammo can.

Not wanting to separate. IF I was going to, I'd be looking for $450 on the SKS, $500 on the AK and $400 on the Tec 9. So I'm offering them up here as a bulk package price. I'm definitely not going to separate them until theres been 0 interest in the package for two weeks. I'm not driving across the state for $1250. So if Bass Pro shops @ Cincinnati Mall is to far, thanks for looking. No one from a non-neighboring State to Ohio. CHL holders, Middletown Sportsman club members move to the head of the line. I can arrange a test fire @ my Clubs range tues-sun. $35 ahead of time paid via paypal for 10 rounds through each gun, if we work a deal the $35 is deducted from our negotiated price. If not, thats the ""tire kicker"" penalty, I keep the $35 for my time and ammo. Only shipping to an FFL."
