Leave the power set at 3x or 4x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your rifle in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

It comes with everything as new.  All documents, owners manual, original case, two 12 round magazines, interchangable safety/decocker part, gun lock.  I have a friend with the same gun and this one is a newer model.  Appears CZ has made a few improvements since the .40 cal version was first released.  I paid just over 500 for it.

Sorry, don't have an individual pic right now. It is the SS, lower left gun. Other firearms not for sale. I will be able to get a better pic up Sunday if needed or meet up that afternoon if you want it. This is the model [url]http://www.discountgunsales.com/springfield-1911-ss-9mm-c-728-p-1-pr-4334.html[/url] 
 Gun has target sights and I painted a white tip on the front, but it can be easily removed if you want them blacked out. It has a checkered flat S&A magwell and black Hogue alumagrips. Also has a GI plug installed and it has had a trigger job, very clean break. Single sided Wilson Combat safety installed. Very minor idiot mark on frame not very noticable when slide catch installed and can probably be buffed-out easily. Comes with 5 or 6 9 round metalform mags with bumpers (I think I have 6). Gun shoots great and very accurate/reliable, but I'm funding my first sbr so this needs to go. I would rate overall condition at 90% with about 600-700 rounds through it total and cleaned after every outing. NM serial number prefix, google or message me if you need details on what that means.

Price is $950 obo. FTF in Reno area with Nevada DL/bill of sale. Any questions please ask. REASONABLE offers considered if you're cool. Not interested in trades unless you have a Champion Operator. With the upgrades and the magazines I have over $1,300 into this package. Thanks!"

So much so that it was named the NRA Rifle of the year in 2005. 
With a 24” stainless bull barrel, 1 in 10 twist, free floating handguard and a high ride receiver for easier mounting of optics, the LR-308 has gone toe to toe with bolt action rifles and delivered comparable accuracy, with higher magazine capacity and rate of fire. The conventional thought that ""only a bolt action could be considered a precision rifle"" has been in contention ever since.

It is in beautiful condition. Looks as if it was only used maybe one season. The tooling is amazing. For the price I'm asking, you'd make minimum wage if you were the one to hand tool this.

I looked it over and found a maker's mark. It's a Simco, says Est 1933 (I know that's not when it was made). But it was probably between 1960 and 1970. Simco's of early provenance appear to be more popular than most other vintage saddles. It is a Model 35. Definitely old.

You could definitely use this saddle, but honestly I think it would be better on display.

I'm very fair. We'll trade against both lows... both averages (most fair and what I listed) or both highs. High value for this saddle is $1200. AND APPRECIATING.

But, I'd still rather have a pistol, than a beautiful saddle.

This has been fired very little and carried even less, I would call it a solid 98% only because I am picky. There are a few very slight rub marks in the nickel but absolutely no flaking or pitting at all, one very slight rub mark on the grips. The action is pure butter, trigger pull is light and crisp like all Pythons. This is one of the most highly sought after Snakes suitable for either display or shooting. No box or papers and price reflects this.

I am looking for $1950 cash or very reasonable offer, I am open to and prefer trades (see below). 

This is a private sale in the greater Tampa Bay area, I require FL ID and/or CWP. I will ship from my FFL to your FFL anywhere in the lower 48 states for $35.00. Thanks for looking and have a great day!"

Caliber:   .300 AAC Blackout

Barrel Length:  16""

Color:  Black

Capacity:  30rd

NO SIGHTS MODEL

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, v5-300 AAC Blackout comes in two different configurations no sights or fixed front/rear sights.

The 300 BlackOut is designed to be shot suppressed and un-surpressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions.  The testing of the Daniel Defense 300 BlackOut firearms indicates that un-surpressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend.  Although, though our extensive testing we did ascertain that the utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-surpressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.

These, with the FOP engraving on the side, were available to members of the Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, DC in 1989 when the department converted from revolvers to the Glocks. These were not issued by the government, they were offered thru the FOP lodge from Glock. 

Departmental communication in those days was by ""Teletype"" machines. I have an original teletype, dated May 30, 1989, announcing the arrival of the Glocks ordered prior to March 1, 1989. I cannot imagine that there is another nut out there that has this message from 1989...my bet is that this is the only one that exists and it links this gun historically.

This pistol was made in April 1989 and after I first picked it up on June 1, 1989, I fired 20 rounds thru it. Glock then recalled the pistols to change a spring inside to adjust the trigger pull, so I sent mine off to Glock and after they serviced it, I put it away and never fired it. So it is in truly new condition.

Included, with the gun (which has regular white sights, not the glow type) and teletype message, is the original box, manual, two 15 round magazines, a magazine loading assist tool, a Glock #45 holster, original unused bore brush and cleaning rod. I also have the original invoice from Glock for the originial purchase dated May 1989.

Please make sure the magazines are legal in your state, if I find they are not, I guess I will have to send the gun with no magazines and no refund or apology...hope you understand that I don't want to violate any laws.
