I bought this rifle for work but ended up not needing it so now I am looking to trade for a rifle I can hunt with and use for when SHTF.

I have around $1400+ invested into this rifle, it is NEW but I know that you never get out what you put into these things.. so the price has been dropped.. It is a GREAT rifle. Was range tested after I built it and had only 30 rds put through it. There are NO dings/scratches/marks.

PRICE is FIRM, offers less than $575 ignored, this is a very fair price considering it is unfired and the backorder from Sig is well into 2013 unless you buy one in stock for over $600-$625.

Comes with 1 25 round magazine and hard sig case, it does not come with the red dot in the picture.  Those are sold seperatey.

The Commando features an inert training suppressor mounted by standard ½ x 28 TPI threads. The inert tactical trainer can be removed and the Commando used in the standard rifle configuration. The threaded barrel also accepts many of the most popular flash suppressors and sound suppressor mounts on the market.

The Commando offers the same features as the original SIG522, with an anodized, alloy upper receiver and M1913 rail mounted for the easy addition of optics, sights, lights and lasers. A folding, telescopic stock provides a strong, stable platform for shooters.

The Commando accepts 10 and 25 round polymer SIG522 magazines, and weighing in at 6 lb, 2 oz, the Commando is lighter than a standard SIG556® and enables longer training time with less fatigue, but still retains enough weight for realistic training purposes."

I recived this as a gift from a friend, but am not the revolver type, i would much rather have a pistol with magazine.
Its fun to shoot, fairly accurate, and has been maintained very well, but does have a few imperfections on the gun, yet barrel and important parts are great.

This is my daily carry but sometimes the weapon is available to her.  

About this pistol.  It has around 100 rounds through it, I removed the grease from the rails and the pistol has been cleaned and treated with froglube (which is amazing).  Hardly any carry wear on it.  I use an IWB uncle mike's holster most of the time.  

As far as the trade goes, I would have to see your DL to know who you are.  I'm more than happy to show my DL and LTCH for your records,  I also have the receipt if that interest you.  I would trade magazine for magazine, I have four 13 rd, factory magazines.  I also would trade round for round.  I have 150 rounds of Federal 180 gr FMJ (the China-Mart bulk pack) and 20 rounds (a box) of Hornady Critical Duty.

I also have the Glock polymer holster if your interested.  If you have a holster that you don't like,  I would be willing to do some trading there too.  I've been wanting to try out other kinds.  I can trade you my Blackhawk Serpa with paddle and belt loop attachments.

THIS IS MY BOTTOM DOLLAR.  ITEM WILL BE WITHDRAWN TUESDAY AFTERNOON IF NOT SOLD BY THEN.

The Remington 1100 Tactical 2 is, arguably, one of the finest combat shotguns ever made. I researched it thoroughly before purchasing this. It is more reliable than a Saiga and more durable than a Mossberg. Short 18"" barrel with a 6+1 capacity, and you can reload between shots without needing to change magazines. Being gas-operated with a steel receiver it is one of the lightest recoiling 12 gauge shotguns ever made, and it blows fist sized holes in things as fast as you can pull the trigger. This is a very well thought out design.

The following improvements to the TAC2 platform have been made:
*Mesa Tactical Urbano stock with adjustable cheek riser and Limbsaver recoil pad.
*Mesa Tactical 6-round side saddle with Picatinny rail if you want to mount an optic.
*Nordic Components charging handle.
*Nordic Components mag clamp (a mini-rail can be ordered for $17 to mount a flashlight on said clamp).
*Oversized safety installed by Bowers Tactical, who also polished the bolt release.
*Condor Tactical shotgun scabbard with gear pouch.
*Assorted small parts & cleaning kit.
*Manual & warranty card.

VERY LOW ROUND COUNT, mostly Federal birdshot, approximately 300 rds. This is an outstanding shotgun, but just not the right choice for me. Due to an injury I have difficulty handling an 8 pound assault weapon without a sling.

I was going to order the mini-tac rail for the mag clamp (part # TRL-BCT-150) to mount a flashlight and a Tru-Glo fiberoptic front sight, but never got around to it. I highly recommend these items to the new owner. A red dot or holographic sight can be mounted on the top rail, or you can remove it and mount ghost rings. Many possible options.

AMMUNITION INCLUDED: 6 unopened boxes of Winchester #1 Buck, 6 unopened boxes of Winchester Mil-Spec 00 Buck, and a pair of A-Zoom snap caps. That is 60 rounds of the BEST buckshot available, plus a pair of training rounds to practice reloads and dry fire.

This shotgun is practically new and has nearly $500 in extras.

Asking only $700 CASH.  (Trade value 900, but flexible.)

Not really looking for trades. If you have a quality compact AR in 5.56 or 9mm that would work, as would a S&W 10mm. Would also consider a hammerless alloy .38 + cash, or possibly a double 20 + cash.

Colorado sale only. Will not ship. Will not travel too far beyond greater Denver area. No bill of sale required, but must be a legal CO resident and not a dirtbag.

Shotgun is in perfect mechanical condition and excellent cosmetic condition.  Bought this as my SHTF HD weapon, but an injury prevents me from handling an 8# shotgun comfortably and effectively.  My loss is your gain.  This package is worth about 1,000 and you can have it for only 700.  Price is firm, cash only or approved trade.

The response I got was very positive, a lot of Metro area shooters would love to get together for shooting/hunting times and commute when possible to areas like Pawnee in the northeast or Commanche in the south. The next step was to find a proper method of delivery for a shooting club, with a forum being the most obvious answer.
Facebook groups seemed to be a pretty good idea, but with the shift to Timeline it would be tough to keep the group ""private"", and prevent strangers from seeing your pictures and whatnot, so I decided to use a private forum website, Forumotion.com

Here is the link to what I have created.
http://denvershootingclub.forumotion.com

It really is nothing fancy, take a minute or two to see what it is all about and hopefully it is something to add to favorites and check now and again to see what is going on. I know it may not catch on, but it would be cool to save some gas or money, as well as meet new friends, by commuting to outdoors areas.

Thanks again for reading this, and look up my previous Denver Shooting Club ad if you want to see how this all started. Hopefully I will see you guys on the forum, and in the field.

The rifles were made from existing stockpiles of Mauser bolt-action rifles, the FR-7 from the rifle model 1919 Santa Barbara and the FR-8 from the 1943 Santa Barbara carbine. They were adjusted to the new NATO calibre 7.62×51mm and, being of a suitably compact built, the FR 8 was used well into the 1970s by mounted Guardia Civil units in the Sierra Nevada.  The flash hider was designed to be compatible with NATO-standard rifle grenades. The under-barrel tube, which resembles the gas cylinder found on automatic weapons, actually serves as the bayonet mount and as storage for cleaning gear. The rear sight is an elevation-adjustable rotary type with aperatures for 200 m (220 yd), 300 m (330 yd) and 400 m (440 yd), as well as an open ""V"" notch for 100 metres (110 yd). The front sight is elevation-adjustable via a special tool. Operation is identical to the standard Mauser design."

Weapon is in excellent condition. The 26 has had one 33 round magazine through it for functionality and sight adjustment only. It is dead on accurate. Glock is the most dependable and well thought out weapon systems in the world. I am a certified firearm instructor who has worked with all make and model semi auto pistols. Glock is the only one I would trust with my life straight from the box. Very few moving parts, incredibly rugged, and incredibly accurate and user friendly. The Glock 26 will accept all Glock 9mm magazines 10,15,17, and 33 round including the G-18 DRUM. The most perfect back up ever, allowing you to use your primary Glocks (17, 18, 19 and 34) magazines should your full size fail (not likely.) This is also a very diverse and kick ass weapon going from a sub-compact to a high capacity assault pistol (M 10, Tec 9 styles but very high quality not junk) by simply inserting a 33 round magazine. Every Glock I have owned will eat up any and all types of ammo including all soft hollow point rounds. I have never encountered a single jam from any model Glock! Comes with two 10 round magazines, one with Pierce grip extension as well as a tuck and go inside the pant holster. One box of range 9mm amo. Pac grip. Ejection port brushed with acid for a very nice two tone look. Wrong person for games or people just wanting to talk guns. I am not happy about having to sell my 26 but family comes first so serious inquiries only. Also proper Colorado ID, bill of sale, and must be of legal age and standing to own a firearm in this state, no exceptions!"

Here is a Les Baer AR (Super Varmint 223) with a 20"" SS bull barrel.  This is a very early serial number from Hillsdale, IL, not Le Claire.  It is in fantastic condition and comes with the following:

-Factory matched and fitted Les Baer upper and lower
-Factory bi-pod
-Quick release rings
-Simmons hi-power 50mm scope
-1 20rd magazine
-1 black rifle back with pockets

The bottom line is that I really don't get to shoot this enough and it's an incredible shame to be locked away in a safe.  This rifle is more accurate than you are, promise.  Aside from being a Baer, my favourite thing about this is the 2-stage trigger pull.  There's a centimeter of smooth travel before the most crisp break I have ever felt, including a Les Baer 1911.

New, these are $2200 plus tax and that's before the scope.  This is a fantastic deal on a very fine weapon that is rarely available in the second hand market.  The reason being is that they are so good people just don't sell them.

I have additional and hi-res pictures available.  They were too large to upload on AL but will give you a great idea just how nice this custom firearm is.

$1800 cash only, no trades unless very high end 1911s in perfect shape.  The price is very firm.

Must be willing to meet on the East side of Cincinnati.

One of the few saws on the market that bevels to both sides, the Hitachi lets you make compound cuts to the right or left without the hassle of transferring marks or repositioning stock--and the 10 amp motor is situated above the arbor to allow a wider cutting range. Unlike other top-heavy saws, the Hitachi remains well balanced and easy to maneuver--which, along with its smooth-operating blade guard, makes it a relatively safe saw to use. The saw's table allows a good miter range, swinging 57 degrees right and 46 degrees left, and the unique bevel and miter scale makes cutting crown molding a snap whether you're an expert or a novice.
We especially like how Hitachi's multi-V-belt soft-start transfer delivers power smoothly. The saw doesn't jump or buck on start-up, so cuts are generally safe and easy to keep true. The saw cuts 3-1/2- to 12-inch stock at a 90-degree miter, and at 45 degrees the saw handles a 9-inch cut. We also like that the Hitachi features adjustable plastic fences that give support when cutting small pieces close to the blade, but are a bit disappointed that the saw lacks a detent override, a mechanism that disengages the preset table settings and makes it easier to lock into angles close to 0 and 45 degrees.

No question about it, though, the Hitachi C10FS is a tough saw that easily stands up to the rigorous demands of the job site; ours survived a tailgate tumble with hardly a scratch. The well-designed bevel-locks and scales, nicely balanced head, and smooth operation make this a great tool whether you're a professional or a serious home improvement enthusiast. --Mark McDonald

From the Manufacturer
Reduce noise and recoil during start-up with the soft-start feature on this 10-inch saw. The saw is capable of cutting up to 4 by 4 inches at 45 and 90 degrees with a crosscut reach of 12 inches. The electronic speed control helps maintain rpm for constant cutting speed, and you'll get superior accuracy from the linear ball bearing slide system. Professionals will appreciate the right and left bevel cutting capacity and cutting-depth stopper for creating smooth grooves. Your saw purchase includes a slide fence, vise assembly, dust bag"

It left the factory as a rifle, and was later cut down to carbine specs.  The serial number matches to an 1886 manufacture, and the Buffington sight, and grooved trigger match to 1884 specs, - but the breech-block is marked 1873.  With the exception of an incorrect to the era ramp-style front sight, and perhaps the absence of a saddle ring and bar, it otherwise appears to be a carbine until closer observation.  The bore on this rifle is minty crisp.  I have only shot one box of 20 rounds through it since I bought it.  I also have 5 boxes of PMC 405 gr. Lead Flat Point, and 1 box of Remington 405 gr. SP that I will sell with the rifle for an additional $150.00 to make a $700.00 package deal.

The gun is fun to shoot, is accurate, and qualifies for use as a ""primitive"" firearm when hunting in Mississippi.  This gun is also an antique and does not have to transfer through a FFL.  

... I really kind of hate to sell it, but I need to generate some cash to put into some house repairs.  I'm not interested in any trades at this time.  The gun is for sale locally, and I will meet in the middle anywhere between Birmingham, Montgomery, and Auburn, Alabama, - beyond that, the buyer will pay all shipping fees."

The Remington 1100 Tactical 2 is, arguably, one of the finest combat shotguns ever made. I researched it thoroughly before purchasing this. It is more reliable than a Saiga and more durable than a Mossberg. Short 18"" barrel with a 6+1 capacity, and you can reload between shots without needing to change magazines. Being gas-operated with a steel receiver it is one of the lightest recoiling 12 gauge shotguns ever made, and it blows fist sized holes in things as fast as you can pull the trigger. This is a very well thought out design.

The following improvements to the TAC2 platform have been made:
*Mesa Tactical Urbano stock with adjustable cheek riser and Limbsaver recoil pad.
*Mesa Tactical 6-round side saddle with Picatinny rail if you want to mount an optic.
*Nordic Components charging handle.
*Nordic Components mag clamp (a mini-rail can be ordered for $17 to mount a flashlight on said clamp).
*Oversized safety installed by Bowers Tactical, who also polished the bolt release.
*Condor Tactical shotgun scabbard with gear pouch.
*Assorted small parts & cleaning kit.
*Manual & warranty card.

VERY LOW ROUND COUNT, mostly Federal birdshot, approximately 300 rds. This is an outstanding shotgun, but just not the right choice for me. Due to an injury I have difficulty handling an 8 pound assault weapon without a sling.

I was going to order the mini-tac rail for the mag clamp (part # TRL-BCT-150) to mount a flashlight and a Tru-Glo fiberoptic front sight, but never got around to it. I highly recommend these items to the new owner. A red dot or holographic sight can be mounted on the top rail, or you can remove it and mount ghost rings. Many possible options.

AMMUNITION INCLUDED: 6 unopened boxes of Winchester #1 Buck, 6 unopened boxes of Winchester Mil-Spec 00 Buck, and a pair of A-Zoom snap caps. That is 60 rounds of the BEST buckshot available, plus a pair of training rounds to practice reloads and dry fire.

This shotgun is practically new and has nearly $500 in extras.

Asking only $725 CASH. (Trade value 900, but flexible.)

Not really looking for trades. If you have a quality compact AR in 5.56 or 9mm that would work, as would a S&W 10mm. Would also consider a hammerless alloy .38 + cash, or possibly a double 20 + cash.

Colorado sale only. Will not ship. Will not travel too far beyond greater Denver area. No bill of sale required, but must be a legal CO resident and not a dirtbag.

Shotgun is in perfect mechanical condition and excellent cosmetic condition.
