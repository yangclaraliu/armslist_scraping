USP Compact
Suggested Retail Price: $941 (9 mm , DA/SA ), $991 (.40 S&W ), $1,086  .45 ACP
USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P+ loads full time .
To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed over 20,000 rounds.
Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.
Features & System Characteristics:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life. 200,000 rounds design tested.
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
Choice of corrosion resistant âHostile Environmentâ blued finish or stainless steel slide
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
No snag, bobbed hammer
Flared recurve trigger guard
Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Contoured, extended slide release
Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator
Patented Lock-Out Safety device

removed the rear leaf sight (no front sight to use it with) and put on a scope mount which i cut down to make it look better
the scope mount is solid, but could be replaced with one of the new model nicer ones (this was from a while back)
added a new style normal length monte carlo stock in real tree camo, thi makes the massive 7.62x54r (ammo is about 17cents around and very close to 30-06 round) feel nicer than a old wood with metal buttplate stock!
This is a good deal for all the items now that they are 180 at big 5. Ill throw in a few rounds of 762x54r and try and find a stripper clip or 2 in the price
bore is good and clean (for a 70 year old rifle!) as seen in the bad picture, it is shiney, but has normal wear in the grooves, but lands are good!
wont really take less than 250 unless its a trade, its 10x nicer than stock form to shoot
I can throw in a padded simple case and the pictured 3-9x long eyerelief scope all you would need are some cheap rings (5-10$)
I can show you how to take it apart and clean it too if need be (they are easy but need good cleaning after shooting old ammo) great first gun
Will need to see valid Or ID and need to be 18yrs old or older!

This is a Howa 1500 Varmint in .223 Rem. I bought this gun as a barreled action for a prairie dog trip a couple years ago. I ended up only shooting about 100 rounds through it on the trip, and total round count is well below 500. Probably more like 300. It's got a 20"" barrel that's heavy enough for good balance and accuracy, but not heavy enough to make the gun awkward or too heavy to pack around. Would be a great walking varminter, truck gun or ranch gun for someone. Holds 5 rounds in the mag.

I replaced the factory trigger with a sweet Timney trigger that gives it a really nice trigger pull. I put the action in a full bed Hogue stock. This stock has a full aluminum block in it and is not the cheaper pillar bedded stock that some Howas are sold with.

The action retails at $450, the trigger at $100 and the stock at $130. You can see that I'm taking a pretty big hit on this gun but I just never shoot it and I'd like it to go to someone who likes to target shoot, prairie dog hunt or even coyote/predator hunt. The photo you see is of the actual gun, I just took out the background.

As an added bonus I'll give you the opportunity to buy some of my ammo at a great price. I have 40 gr Hornady Vmax ammo loaded in brand new brass. This is premium hunting ammo and I'll sell you as many as you want at 40 cents a round. It's packed in 50-round cardboard boxes. I was consistently getting 3-shot groups well under an inch with this gun and this ammo.

I'd be glad to answer any questions by email, though I probably won't reply to emails that are simply ""you have this?"" or ""call me at..."". I will remove the post when sold or off the market. Thanks for looking!"

The serial number has it dated to 1987. It has seen little use in that amount of time. My father bought it to hunt and took it out 3 or 4 times before coming down with a herniated disc. He can no longer fire the weapon, and thus it has been sitting in a closet for about a decade. It has been cleaned twice a year during that time and the action is still smooth. I don't know the exact count, but I can't imagine it has seen more than 50 rounds.

As for specifics, this shotgun is chambered for 2 3/4 and 3"" magnum. It comes with two barrels. The 28 in. barrel and a 20 in. Deerslayer barrel. 

Price is 400.00 or best offer. If interested, you can get ahold of me at three 1 seven 5 two five 2 zero two 0. Text works best, as reception isn't great in my area. I work until 3:30 and can't have my phone in the facility, so i'll have to return any messages after then.

Sale will be FTF, preferably in the Indianapolis area. Also, I am not hurting for money, so please no low-ball offers. They will be ignored."

It is not drilled for optics, but shoots dead on with the peep site.  I took it out today and had a three shot group that could be covered by a quarter at 40 yards.  For me with iron sites that pretty good. The only flaw with this rifle is inside the barrel it looks  to have a few miner spots that could be pitting, but it does not seem to hurt the accuracy.  Would make a great dear gun. I am a little flexible on the price, and interested in trades, so go ahead and let me know what you have.

The bottom is a detacable mag belt incase you need to drop your equipment. 

This is one of the best pieces of equipment I have owned. Built very tough. I will say there is a small hole where I removed grenade pouches. In the photo im holding a dime behind the hole. It can be easily repaired with fabric epoxy. Just haven't taken the time to do it.

Up until now, user serviceable centerfire rifle suppressors have been longer and heavier than their sealed counterparts. That's changed with the introduction of the Kestrel 5.56. Engineered from the ground up to maximize serviceability while not compromising on weight, length, or strength, the Kestrel 556 provides the most user friendly centerfire rifle suppressor in existence. Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, ease of maintenance, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Kestrel 5.56 has the features you are looking for.

Suppression

The Kestrel 5.56 had one goal - provide a hearing safe centerfire rifle suppressor that can be easily maintained and repaired. It does not disappoint.

Maintenance

Cleaning the Kestrel 5.56 is a breeze. Centerfire rifle suppressors need to be cleaned and inspected, just like rimfire suppressors.

With the Kestrel 5.56 full user servicability is truely a reality.

The Kestrel core is constructed of stainless steel for superior cleanability. You can use chemical solutions safe to stainless steel but that remove nasty lead deposits (the ""Dip""). The core breaks down so that you can put it into a reloading tumbler, or use a bead blaster for fast and efficient cleaning. And unlike other monocore technologies, you can dip your Kestrel core without worrying about damaging the exposed finish on your core.

Kestrel baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Kestrel core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it.

And as with all Huntertown Arms suppressors, all it takes to remove your end caps is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools required. Ever.

Longevity

There are several features designed into the Kestrel to ensure your safe and enjoyable use of the Kestrel beyond a lifetime.

Most bullet strikes on a suppressor occur on the end cap. The Kestrel design separates the end cap from the registered part so that if there is an end cap strike it will be more likely your suppressor can be repaired or replaced without having to replace the registered part.

We are huge proponents of stacked bafle technology for another reason. With a monocore, there is only one blast baffle. When that blast baffle erodes, the core has to be replaced. This may or may not be a warranty repair, but in any event you have lost the use of your suppressor while it is at the manufacturer for repair.

Kestrel core baffles should be rotated (like tires) whenever the core is cleaned. With four baffles available to act as blast baffles, the Kestrel will allow up to five times the number of rounds fired before re-coring.

Safety

The Kestrel core is fully encased in an inner stainless steel wall. In the event of an internal baffle strike, the inner core is strong enough to capture the damaged projectile and baffle material, protecting the tube as much as possible against catastrophic failure.

This kit comes with a Roland TD-9 drum brain with 2 Vex packs which takes the normal 50 drum kits and adds 25 metal kits featuring kits by world famous heavy metal drummers, and 30 acoustic kits from sonor, pearl, Ludwig, Nobel and Cooley just to name a few. This kit has Roland silent mesh heads on all Toms except the floor tom, on that drum it has a Hart Magnum mesh head. Snare has Roland head as well. Bass drum features a Pintech mesh drum head. All drums are dual triggered, meaning that each drum has separate head/rim sensors so you can add whatever sound you want to each rim, so you can have rim shot sounds, cymbals, cow bells, whatever you desire. (Bass drum is not Dual triggered). This kit can be played at all hours of the day or night without bothering your neighbors or housemates because you can play with headphones. Or you can plug into the Simmons personal drum monitor so you can play loudly as well. This kit comes with 3 Yamaha dual trigger electric cymbals, two cymbal stands, Roland FP-7 Hi-hat controller, Gibraltar bass drum pedal, Pearl Drum throne.

This kit has been autographed by Bun E. Carlos of Cheap Trick. I am disclosing this not to add any value to the kit whatsoever, I just want anyone who buys this kit to know that there is a Signature on the Snare drum in Sharpie permanent marker, and one signed to me on the Bass drum head (which is removable by switching heads)

This kit can be switched back to a conventional acoustic kit by removing the electronics in each drum, which is easily done. and adding regular heads. Can then be switched back to electric again.
This kit has never left my house, which is a non-smoking environment, so condition is perfect."
