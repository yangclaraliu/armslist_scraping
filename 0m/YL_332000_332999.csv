Manufactured in 2009, this reproduction revolver carries all of the signature variations of the original 3rd model Navy; slotted cylinder pin, round trigger guard, and frame cutout without capping channel. the entire finish of this gun has been 'antiqued' and its overall condition is excellent-plus; as can be seen on the right side picture there is not a mark on the wedge pin or barrel – the usual places brutalized by black powder hobbyists. The action is solid -  the timing of the action is near perfect as the cylinder stop drops and locks as it should with no drag on the cylinder; the hammer locking in place just a hair after, and the lock-up is tight with no cylinder play.  This revolver is in excellent overall condition, having only a couple of shooting sessions through it since it was purchased new. This specimen is also a great shooter, and being a .36 caliber, is a pleasure to ‘make smoke’ with.

This pistol comes with wraparound textered soft polymer grips, drift adjustable white bar dot combat sights, two 7 round magazine and factory plastic hard case. It is a used gun with about 250 rounds down the pipe.  Excellent condition and shoot great.

The K9's frame and slide are of stainless steel and have a brushed, matte gray appearance. Rubber grip panels are by Hogue, and feature a pebbled texture on the sides for better traction.  The matte stainless steel is blackened using an ultra hard and super thin coating. This coating has been used successfully in the knife industry to protect blades from corrosion and scratches.

The gun has been 100% reliable This pistol is a delight to shoot. It is fast into action, dynamic in handling, and the trigger pull offers a very rhythmical, flinch-free sort of firing.  One interesting thing about this gun is that everybody who holds it loves the way it feels in his or her hand.

To sum up the Kahr K9 briefly, it is an extremely size-efficient pistol that offers good ergonomics, simple operation, fine workmanship, a smooth trigger action, excellent reliability and very good accuracy. And that is a very hard combination.  It has been heralded as one of the best concealed-carry weapons ever made!

Chiappa Rhino 357 magnum, 4"" barrel.

The Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before.

Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

last few on gunbroker in this condition and vintage fetch close to 500-$600 plus shipping plus ffl fee.  This ammo, if you can find it, goes now for about 40c a round (as it is the best hunting weight) so I think this is a fair price for a quick sale(give or take $420 rifle and $380 ammo, or whatever way you want to swing it :) )
and yes, that pouch with cleaning bottle and a sling are all part of the deal :).  
with this sale you will be getting exactly 950 rounds of WOLF 154gr SP ammo (kind you can't get anymore) which I removed from the boxes a while back and separated into ziplocks and into a box.  so, a package deal for the rifle and ammo - $800.

this is a VIRIDIAN X5L tactical universal weaver &pictanny Rail unit. Bought it for my Glock 17 as an impulse buy, ended up just mounting it and admiring it and never really used it . had it sighted to my irons to 15m in the house (without firing) - never seen the range (partially because I did not have a holster for it).... so it was sitting in a safe mounted to my Glock for 6mo. Now that I did some cleaning, I realize it is no use for me, since my conceal carry G26 does not have a rail to mount it on.

can email you a short video from my iphone with all the modes (basically 3 light modes and 3 laser modes; which you can combine. so you can have strong laser, strong laser+strobe light, strong laser + dim light, strong laser+ strong light, strong light only, strobe light only, dim light only, flashing laser + light combinations, dim laser + light combinations and etc...). in other words, it is pretty packed with options as far as what you want. it is a GREEN laser, so you can see that dot further than you can see in the night, during the day I could see easy ~50m - did not try further. I am pretty sure if you are looking at it, you know what it is and capable of, not to mention at 1/2 of original retail because it is basically is 'used' and gen1, vs $450 brand new and gen2.

this is an X5L (not a cheaper C model).
Original box, manual, 2 batteries(not original and WalMart is the BEST deal on replacement, thats where I got that 2-pack(one in light one in box) and everything it came with (extra screws, allen wrenches, mount key) is included as in the pictures. Box shows little wear on the outside.

The older models retain their value much better than the newer ones because the higher quality of craftsmanship.

As saying goes, Police weapons are worn a lot and shot a little.  

EVEN BETTER, the terms of the Ruger/distributor contract require police weapons to be returned to the Ruger factory to be inspected and cleaned.  Any glitches are handled before it is made available for sale to the public.

THEREFORE, OTHER THAN A FEW SCRATCHES FROM DAILY CARRYING, THE REVOLVER IS IN GREAT CONDITION.

PRICE IS FIRM

Everything you need to get started!!!!



Barrett Model 99 package which includes Pelican Hard Case, Barrett Rings and Bushnell Tactical Scope.



From Barrett:
Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 optics rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match-toleranced barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a rock-solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. The chamber area is encased by the thick-walled aluminum extrusion of the receiver, resulting in unparalleled safety for the shooter.

The bolt is machined from a single piece of shock-resistant tool steel. The action’s strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt’s few moving parts, an extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly, make it reliable and easy to maintain.

The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is exclusive to Barrett and virtually maintenance-free. The bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting.

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 combines smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot.

GSG 5p
Many of you will recognize the GSG-5 because it is modeled after the most widespread and effective submachinegun in the world, the venerable HK MP5, which is used by countless agencies and militarys around the world and has been seen in pretty much every action movie ever. German Sport Guns developed this ""tactical plinker"" to give people a low cost, fun, and legal way for people to get the feel of shooting the MP5. However, there are some things to take note of when considering this weapon.

The Beretta 3032 Tomcat is a simple blowback pistol with a single and double action trigger mechanism. 
The design is simple and small, and very easy to conceal.

Light weight when compared to a full sized service pistol.

Easy to perform a basic field strip and clean.

Inox (stainless steel) version is very resistant to corrosion and allows for low maintenance daily carry.

The barrel can be released to pivot on a pin under the muzzle ('tip-up' barrel). This feature allows a round to be inserted into the chamber directly, without manipulation of the slide. Likewise, the chamber can be easily inspected for its load status, or cleared with a fingernail.

Ammunition companies have also improved on the base .32 ACP load, by producing loadings in 60 grain (3.9 gram) hollow-point, yielding higher muzzle velocity and energy."

To sum up the Kahr K9 briefly,  this pistol is a delight to shoot. It is an extremely size-efficient pistol that offers good ergonomics, simple operation, fine workmanship, a smooth trigger action, excellent reliability and very good accuracy. And that is a very hard combination.  It has been heralded as one of the best concealed-carry weapons ever made! 

I like it a lot, but looking to purchase an AR15 or higher capacity mag carry pistol.
Comes with a new custom holster from Gaunt Leather Works.
MSRP: $855 and up for KAHR K9
