Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. These do not include bolt carrier groups or charging handles.



As a note:  BCM barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly.  Prior to shipping, all BCM upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy.  As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistant with these quality control procedures.









M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)

M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver

In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels. 



T-Marked Upper Receiver 

The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission. 



USGI 1/7 Twist Rate 

The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics. 



Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel 

BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.



Chrome Bore and Chamber 

One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning. 



Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish 

Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base. 



5.56 NATO Chambers 

The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo. 



Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases 

Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets. 



Government Barrel Profiles 

Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems. 



HPT / MP Inspected Barrels 

Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking."

Today's prices still have it at about $5-6 a lb. but HAZMAT and shipping gets it to closer to $8 lb.(shipped two kegs at a time).  Anyone have some of this stuff (WC872, WC860, WC867, WC857, WC870, CW820, etc...) that they bought up but haven't used or don't like?  I'd buy it somewhere between $6 and $8 a lb (up to a keg or maybe more if it's as cheap as YOU paid for it ;).  Anything I can do to save spending an extra $27.50 for the feds to keep me safe ;)

I'd have some H4831sc or H4350 I'd trade too:  I'd trade 2 lbs of mine for your ""spare"" keg (or something in between).  Let me know what you have and what you'll take cash or powder or both for.  Thanks and much respect!"

You are bidding on a seldom seen Model 25 Remington pump in 25-20. These slick little rifles were introduced in 1923 and discontinued in 1935 with approx. 33,000 being made. This one is serial number 14559. This rifle is in excellent mechanical condition with very smooth operation. You can see it has been used but not abused. Overall finish is maybe 80% with general thinning to the blue. Carry wear and wear on barrel from over enthusiastic cleaning I'd say. Bore is shiny and unpitted. Stock is solid with no cracks. There is barely a mark on the wood and it has probably 90% of it's original finsh. Forend rates excellent as well. Original REM UMC crescent buttplate. This is a neat little rifle for small game. Original open sights are present. Do NOT snooze on this piece! 
The rifle also comes with a box of unfired 25-20 rounds.

Has a trigger job done professionally. Everything has under 20 rounds through it, some parts have 0 rounds. It has a Harris 6-9 bipod, a Weaver tactical 6-18x scope. After the build was finished, it got a professional durakote job. I chose durakote for higher protection from abrasion and heat. The durakoting was over 500 dollars but it is the best finish you can get. The finish is digital camo and looks like a factory finish, no chips or cracks. I haven't got to have the fun with this rifle that I was hoping to but I do know it will shoot 3 inch groups at 400 yards, even better in the hands of a more experienced shooter. It comes with 3 mags that were also durakoted to match. I am not pressed to sell and may trade. Shoot me an offer"

Unfortunately today I encountered a complete ***hole on here. I had one of my items listed up for trade just like I always do. I was approached by an individual who offered me a trade in return for my item. There were negotiations on either side just like always, but I noticed that this individual was a little stubborn about making a deal, and kept stating his items were worth more than they actually were. I pulled up an online ad where the items were in stock and available and showed it to them to prove the value of what they had. This went on for a while and finally they posted their offer and said take it or leave it. I respectfully said I will consider it and they said""If you find a better offer go ahead and take it, if not my offer stands. Today I was approached by another individual who made me a better offer so I took it. Out of respect and friendliness I sent the individual a message letting him know what I found, and that I was taking another offer so he was not waiting on me. They responded back ""Am I supposed to give a sh*t?"" 

People like this discourage me from wanting to trade and sell on here, and also give our  community of shooters a bad name and image. I really enjoy this site and most of the people who use it, and would hate for one bad apple to stink up the whole group. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has experienced this on here and probably wont be the last. My question is: is there any way to report people like this to suspend them from posting on here? The best I could do is save their email address and their phone number so if I hear from them again I can just ignore them. Thanks in advance?"

I’ll also include a hard case for the gun.  If you wish to view it locally it’s currently at Bulls Eye Shooter’s Supply in Tacoma.  Ignore the price there; I have to mark it up that much to offset their new consignment fees.  I won’t pull it from them unless you are a serious buyer, no time for tire kickers, cash talks.  Again this is a brand new gun, never fired, or had optics mounted on it, it’s super CLEAN!   This is not a DPMS or Century Arms!  It’s a Mossberg & they’ve been making great guns here in America for nearly 100 years.  I don’t really want to sell this AR, as it’s not even had a trip to the range yet.  But I need the money & you all know what the current AR climate is like.  So it & my other AR are on the block.  This is an OBO first come price; if it sells at Bulls Eye then it’s sold.

	This rifle has had 1000 rounds shot through it and cleaned and maintained after every use. It has the Ultimak Gas Tube Rail system and the Dog Rail v.2 Dust cover. The pistol grip has been replaced with a Hogue grip. This sale comes with 2 working steel mags, each can hold 30 rounds. I've modified the sight system and removed the standard front sight and rear sight for a railed system and after market sights.

Price is a little high to scare off people just wanting to do cash.

It's an older Savage 340 chambered in .223.  
It has:
3 .223 five round mags.
Scope rings.
A 3x9 scope(not an expensive one, but a good, sturdy one)
An interchangeable barrel in .222 Remington (what the .223 was based on. A sum up of it is it shoots a bit further, and flatter than the .223, but it doesn't tumble on impact.)
2 .222 five round mags.
Seven boxes of .222 ammo.
And a laser bore sight for .223.

It also fires milsurp 5.56 quite well, and prefers the 55gr rounds as opposed to heavier.

All you need for swapping the barrels is a vice and a wrench, and somewhere around 15 minutes work to realign. Not hard, but not an on the fly thing.

A great, accurate, versatile rifle.
Has a fairly high round count, but has been well taken care of. Has a few scratches from hunting.

I have some great pictures, but they are too large. Please email with offer if you request pictures.
Note: I have no need to sell this, so unless you are local, and willing to pay much more than its worth, I will only consider trades."

I can’t stress enough how good looking this rifle is.  The pictured optic is not included. I have a MBUS installed & a variable 3-9 with a burris QD mount. The rifle is in excellent condition with less than 100 rounds down the tube, it’s broken in and sighted for zero @ 100 yd.  I’ll toss in one 30 round GI mag and a tactical soft case.  As new as you can get with all of the dirty work done, take it to the range & light’m up!  This weapon has been to the range exactly one time to break in the barrel & sight in the MUBS & optic.  Then she went into the safe.  I’m not including a bunch of pictures because you know that a new break in rifle is clean.  If you wish to view the rifle locally it’s currently at Bulls Eye Shooter’s Supply in Tacoma.  Ignore the price there; I have to mark it up that much to offset their new consignment fees.  I won’t pull it from them unless you are a serious buyer, no time for tire kickers, cash talks. This is an OBO sale if it sells at Bulls Eye, it’s sold.   This is a head turner for sure with the MOE furniture & the SS barrel it doesn’t look like all of the other cookie cutter black riffles at your range. I don’t want to sell it, but you know the story, I need the money.  So here it is.  

HERE IS THE SPECS FROM PSA:
16"" 416 stainless steel, 1:8 twist with Wylde chamber, mid-length gas port, lead-lapped for accuracy, and standard M4 feedramps.  Barrels are finished off with a taper pinned, f-marked, front sight post, and A2 flash hider.  The barrel is relieved slightly under the handguards to reduce weight.  The Wylde chamber was designed to be compatible with both 223 and NATO 5.56.  This makes for a more versatile upper than a 5.56.  Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and mil-spec finish. This is an American made mil-spec upper and they are marked with the Palmetto State Armory logo on the left side, up front, just below the rail.  Bolt is Shot-peened  Mil-spec Carpenter 158 steel.  Gas key is secured with grade 8 fasteners and staked per mil-spec.  M-16 style bolt carrier is parkerized outside and chrome lined inside. The forged lower is quality made using 7075-T6 aluminum and is marked ""MULTI"" for caliber.  Finish is Black Hardcoat Anodize per MIL-8625 Type 3 class 2.

This is not a bone stock, ragged out, or cheap AR-15. It is a full Spikes rig with all necessary options and has been fully sighted in. It is in beautiful condition and well cared for in all ways. I just have two and while I do not need to sell, thought I would see what is out there. Needless to say the rifle alone cost $1200, the scope $400, the flip-up $100, and all the added accessories another $200. However, as we all know Spikes is about 1 year behind on orders and similar rigs are going for $2000 to $2500. I am NOT looking to rip anyone off, I would just like to add some new toys to my arsenal and do not need so many AR's.

I really don't need the money and I am looking a full or partial trade.  I HAVE DECIDED THAT ONLY FULL VALUE CASH OFFERS ARE CONSIDERED AND I WILL SALE FOR FULL PRICE WITHOUT TRADES. A full trade would obviously require several guns on your part. I am willing to trade current value for current value. NO BS.
Email me and I will consider what you have. Face-to-face and full trade and sale certificate required. 

Just look around here, on other sights and at dealers. Stripped Spikes are going for $1500 with nothing included. People are requesting over $1200 for bare DPMS and Bushmasters are between $2000 and $4000. Let’s be honest, this is a really fair deal."
