The frame is blued but the slide is more of a chromed slide. This is a great gun, never had any issues with it, just not attached to it. I'm not the first owner, so I'm not 100% sure of the round count. Comes with Gun, 1 Colt Magazine and the box. Only noticeable spot to me is the ""dummy markings"" found on most 1911s where people slide the takedown pin down on the left side towards the trigger. (It was like that when I got it). The rear sight is a MMC Night sight but it has lost its charge. I always just used it as a regular sight with no problems.

Brand new unfired custom Palmetto State Armory semi-auto 5.56mm AR-15. For those not familiar with Palmetto State Armory receivers these are forged aluminum mil-spec. The stock assembly on this receiver is commercial spec. Although PSA is not as well-known as other brands, their quality is second to none.

Unlike cheap guns on the market (which use cast non mil-spec parts), this rifle uses match-grade forged/CNC components, such as trigger assembly, lower parts, bolt, carrier, etc. THIS UPPER WAS ASSEMBLED BY TATUM TACTICAL SOLUTIONS, INC USING FACTORY NEW PARTS. The quality & fitment of this rifle's components is second to none-better than any other I have seen which is why I exclusively use this combination. Multi Caliber marked lower receiver, so different calibers can legally be used by simply switching uppers (if ever desired). In current form, either 5.56mm or .223 REM may be used. Weapon has never been fired. Some of the features: 

•	PSA lower & mil-spec trigger/hammer
•	BRAND NEW M4 Upper Receiver with Quad Rail
•	16"" Chrome Moly M4 Profile Barrel 1:9 twist.
•	Mil Spec Flat top upper with M4 Feed Ramps

•	6 position no-play carbine butt stock-uses lands on the internal side to contact the extension tube at tight tolerances
•	Nikon Prostaff Riflescope 3-9X40 Matte BDC. The new PROSTAFF 3-9x40 riflescopes feature a bright new optical system, remarkable new hand-turn reticle adjustments with Zero-Reset turrets and a convenient quick-focus eyepiece. The ideal fit for most any shooting style: Enough power for the longest shots and a wide field of view for thick brush or timber
•	Burris AR-P.E.P.R Scope Mount with Picatinny Ring Tops
•	MAGPUL MIAD pistol grip with internal storage compartment. Interchangeable front and rear straps, as well as a range of storage core options allow the end user to adjust the grip for hand size as well as dynamic mission requirements

The One and Only Dual Field-of-View Combat Optical Sight

The SpecterDR™ rifle sight, designed to meet the requirements of the USSOCOM for elite SpecOps missions, is the one and only truly dual field-of-view combat sight. The SpecterDR™ 1-4x combat optical sight switches instantly from close combat 1x to telescopic 4x at the throw of a lever.

Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR™ rifle sight offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes.

Depending upon the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the entire crosshair or just a brilliant red dot in the center.

In 4x mode the SpecterDR™ rifle sight offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN’s legendary crystal clear image. In CQB mode, the SpecterDR™ sight has by far the largest field of view in the industry.

The 4x and CQB Reticles are plainly visible even in the case of loss of electrical power due to battery failure or EMP.

The SpecterDR™ dual role combat sight combines the traditional benefits of a red dot sight together with those of a magnified telescopic sight, providing a wide field-of-view in 1x mode as well as target identification and accuracy at range in 4x mode.

The SpecterDR™ rifle sight offers optimum situational awareness in both magnifications due to generous eye relief and unmatched viewing in low light conditions

THE top product among the small arms of the world is without doubt the GLOCK ""Safe Action"" pistol. It employs innovative safety features which makes the pistol easy to operate. No other pistol offers a better price-performance ratio. Its minimum weight and legendary GLOCK reliability are unsurpassed.

It is exactly these characteristics that meet the requirements of police, special units, security services and the military. Extremely tough tests by public law enforcement agencies prove time and time again that GLOCK ""Safe Action"" pistols function without compromise, even under the most extreme conditions.

ACTION
Safe and ingeniously simple: Contrary to conventional, the trigger is the only operating element. All three pistol safeties are deactivated when the trigger is pulled -and automatically activated when it is released.

TENIFER
Unique GLOCK hi-tech surface refinement for barrel and slide. Apart from optimum corrosion protection and anti-reflective finish, a degree of hardness of 64 HRC - close to that of a diamond - is achieved.

POLYMER
Corrosion resistant, tougher than steel and still 86% lighter. More than 20 years ago, GLOCK pistols were the first industrially manufactured handguns with high-tech polymer frames.

I just bought it on June 29th (two days ago). I have the receipt, and it states that I paid $227.00 for it, plus another $10 for the background check. Included in the purchase is a matching scope. The warranty card is in the box, along with the manual, and the warranty card has NOT been filled out by me. So, this is a brand new beauty that comes with the full factory warranty. All I've done is take it out, fire 28 rounds through it (to get the 4x32 scope sighted-in, and, truthfully, to see what it's like). Let me tell you, this thing is an real tack driver! I love that it has a stainless steel barrel, which will never rust. The scope is just a cheap scope that came with the rifle, but don't dismiss it. It works well!

Okay, so what's the deal? Brand new rifle for sale??? Have no fear, there NOTHING wrong with the rifle! Just my strange hobby. Read on!

It's not uncommon for me to stop at gun stores when I'm the vicinity and look at .22 rifles. Stock always changes, and occasionally I find something really worthwhile or unusual. I love .22's. They're my hobby, and I am fortunate enough to indulge it. Plus, .22's are fun, and they're cheap to buy ammo for! Normally, it's the same old stuff I see in the stores...the Ruger 10-22, the regular Marlin 60's, etc. Those are the two best selling .22 rifles in the world btw (the Marlin 60 is #1, and more accurate out of the box). And usually, they look just like all the others. This one, however, was and is extra nice! They made this one extra beautiful. I had to buy it, and I did. It was just too nice a rifle to pass up. I've seen the Marlin Model 60 before, even this model SB with the walnut stock, but they usually don't come with this nice a grade of walnut and smooth finish. The walnut with stainless steel is a real looker. The combination is absolutely gorgeous, and you just don't normally see rifles this good looking and finely finished and fitted for under $500. Anyway, after I got it home, I saw that it uses the normal LR ammo, just like 99% of all .22 rifles do. Well...I thought that since it has a tube -fed magazine (which, unlike most folks I am a partial to), that this model 60 would be like my old Henry .22 (also a tube-fed rifle), and be capable of taking shorts and longs in addition to the regular LR ammo. Well, apparently only the Henry .22 rifle and one particular Marlin XT model are capable of that little trick. Okay, no big deal. I'm now selling it, and I am asking the same amount as what I paid for it. Consider it having been hand-selected and sighted-in by me! I did the leg work, found it, and now you get to buy it, fill out the warranty, and have saved yourself the time and gas of shopping. Plus, buying from me saves you the extra $10 background check.

I live in Jacksonville, but would be happy to meet with you in Medford for inspection and delivery.

Very rare to find, you'll see them now as the Savage 110 BA. I've never shot a 300 Win Mag that shoots as soft as this, my Rem700 308 kicks harder than this. This is a sub MOA gun, very often shooting cloverleafs at 100yd with handloads.

I hated the plain black stock so Duracoated it Flat Dark Earth and added a Karsten Cheekrest. IOR V-TAC 30mm scope rings, SWFA Super Sniper 16x MilDot scope, and Harris Bipod

Only selling this to fund another project. You can't go wrong with this rifle, it has the power, range, and accuracy to drop about anything in North America in one shot. I'll also pass on what handloads worked well."

It is left hand in 300 Win.Mag. The barrel is stainless with the Browning BOSS muzzle break system included. The stalk is black composite. There are no scratches or heavy wear marks, this has only had 40 or so rounds through it. It is paired with an awesome Nikon Titanium Monarch 5.5-16.5x44 mm scope. Its titanium construction saves weight and adds rugged durability. Due to its price I think, Nikon has since stopped making these. These have great reviews with anyone who has actually owned one. This rifle scope combination would be great for anyone hunting larger game in harsher conditions. I hate to sell it, but shooting habits have changed and looking to buy maybe an FNH SCAR or some other toy. Let me know if you are interested."

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots.

Gas powered air compressor

Metal lathe, minimum size 10x36

Welding table, minimum thickness 1/2"" minimum size 3ft x 4ft

The Cash prices above are pretty much firm.  Much rather trade, don't really need the money but the firearm inventory has gotten a bit ""large""....

No time for ""tire kickers"" so serious parties only please.
 Prefer to communicate via phone but PM is okay also

These look like the real Mark 23 that have been used by the USN Seal team. This is just a reference to a part that is legally available, but it is ""not"" included with this pistol.

I am selling my Remington 700 PSS .338 Lapua Magnum with Nightforce 20 MOA picatinny rail, GG&G heavy duty bipods, and Pelican Case.  I have fired exactly 60 rounds through this rifle and it has been meticulously cleaned and maintained at regular intervals, and especially just after firing.  It has always been stored in the pelican case.  I just don't get out and shoot it enough, and would like to buy a new hunting rifle.  This is basically a brand new rifle.  Put on your choice of optics and you're ready to shoot.  It is the newer version, which is a 40x action on a 40x trigger (externally adjustable), with a 26"" bull barrel 1:10 twist with muzzle brake.

Found a good deal on something I want so cash is king right now.  Overall the dagger is in good shape, the main issues with it are the handle has a separation crack in it and has some minor wear on the handle decoration and blade. The crack is visible as only a hairline fracture, but when the handle is removed from the tang it is in 2 pieces. I have not done anything to clean this, it's exactly like I've received it. I will try and answer any questions, but I am no expert. It has no authentication papers, but from what I have researched the markings on the blade seem to match this one found here-

Flli Pietra .36 Cal. Black Powder 

I came across this sweet looking gun, and really know nothing much at all about it. What we have here a beautiful Flli Pietta - Made in Italy .36 cal. Black Powder Gun. Has assorted markings on it? BZ in a box, PN with a star over it, 2 crossed 16 May 1643 on it, says also Engraved by W.L. Oresby New York & Patent No., but no number is there? Beautiful wood grips have some initials on on side, just can not figure out what they are. I read that this is their Colt type version of this gun. Also that they can be converted to a regular shell type gun. Serial number is # 525461, it is a beautiful gold frame and black barrel and cylinder. When cocked the trigger has notch to use as sight when lined up with little gold ball at end of barrel. She is in georgous condition. A little bar knocks out to remove the cylinder, I'm told this is a cap and ball type blackpowder gun, a 6 shooter. Personally I love this thing , but one I don't do Black Powder, two I don't have the money to convert it to a real bullet shooting cowboy gun, and third I would really rather have something I can actually use to carry or what-ever. So yes, I will keep price high and be in no hurry to sell it and wait for the right trade to come along. Would like to trade for something, but will sell for $399

Remington Model 1100 Auto 12 guage Shotgun

 20'' modified barrel on it with one site bead. Shoots only 2 3/4 shells, has wood stock. She is old and shows her years of use, but is in excellent working condition. This was the days of changing barrels instead of chokes, so it also comes with a 29'' Skeet barrel with 2 site beads on it. Again shows years of use, but no rust. This lady has taken her share of clay birds and game, oh and loads of crow. Would like to trade for something, but will sell her for $599

Custom built LONG STROKE piston AR 
I had this long stroke piston upper built because I could not afforded the over priced long stroke piston available on the market today ($2500.00 to $3000.00)
I have never had the chance to shoot it and now due to financial needs I have to let it go. looking for best offer or trades

2 types of pistons are available from manufactures, long and short stroke.

Shot stroke pistons are more common because they are cheaper to produce. 
Ruger, Sig, S&W, ect. All produce short stroke piston because it is easier and cheaper for them to do so. 

Why a long stroke? A Long stroke piston cost more money but are a better system. The long stroke piston is the same system that the AK47 utilizes. A low-pressure, long-stroke gas piston design keeps from ""hammering"" the bolt as the short stroke designs do. By slowing down the acceleration of the bolt mass instead accelerated it over a greater distance. The result is less shock forces on the system, longer lasting parts and reliable feeding. It's the difference between unlocking your bolt with a ball peen hammer or accelerating it on a cushion of air!

The only companies that I am aware of that produce long stroke pistons are POF and LWRC although there may be others. Both of these companies charge well over $2500.00 for there long stroke pistons which is why I had mine built. 

This Long Stroke gas piston system is rated at a 1,000,000 compressions cycles allowing it to out live the life of the rifle itself.

The HK USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) is the first service pistol based on a modular concept. During development of the USP, the requirements of the Military and Security forces have consistently been taken into consideration. Thanks to the use of an improved Browning locking system with a patented buffer system, the USP recoil behaviour is unobtrusive even during the use of the highest powered ammunition. The buffer system reduces recoil forces and increases both service life of the pistol as well as improves recoil behaviour. The modular design of the USP enables an individual adaptation of safety and trigger mechanisms to any requirement.
