No import marks, bore is fair but will clean up to good+, very good finish, functions great. Comes with one SA marked original magazine.

Purchased this a while back, original stock was ruined. I ordered a reproduction stock which is a perfect copy of the original stock/handguard, it fits well but the handguard needs to be sanded/fitted better.(This will take a total of an hour out of your day)
The scope rail has 2 holes on either side for an aftermarket scope mount. These are cosmetic only and do not harm the function of the rifle. I never noticed them and if they bother you, put a SVT scope on the rifle and you wont see them. See these holes in picture.

Gun is ready to go, functions great. I just need to thin the herd.

Finn captures are hard to find and cost around $1000 if you can find them.

This poor little guy was ""rode hard and put up wet"", figuratively speaking. Someone decided to ""streamline"" the forearm (narrowed it) and there is a serious ding on the top of the barrel. See photo. Purely cosmetic. Bore is excellent. Overall I would rate it good cosmetically and very good mechanically.

The rifle is being sold WITHOUT the Williams 5D sight unless you want to pay for the sight. It is brand new and the rifle has not been shot since the sight was mounted. $150.00 plus actual shipping. Make sure your FFL will accept from an individual or you will have to pay my FFL fees. 

I will accept a return if there is something I misrepresented but you pay shipping both ways and the transfer fee for my FFL to me."

*body Armour degrades over time even if you don't wear it and its older than the expiration date* 

really? so my ceramic Armour is going to go bad even though its been in mint condition and lightly worn and never took a round.


or my Kevlar panels are going to go bad because i have sweat on them? WTF? lets get something straight the Kevlar is sealed within a water proof plastic 95% of the time like a life vest floatation device is foam within the orange plastic, of coarse the materials are different know you just understand the beginning of what im saying because the bullet proof Kevlar panels ARE wrapped in waterproof material.

unless you go around crawling through mud rolling around in rocks all day or sweat your ass off 24/7 with this vest on for 3 months straight without a shower or bath......im pretty sure it'll be fine..  if its been folded numerous times or the sealing packing has been cut open exposing the panel to the environment that's understandable to stay away from. 



if you are really worried about needing a vest why would you buy one used in the first place?  i wouldn't wear one of these if i hadn't tested it myself and proved they work way well after expiration date.


yet people on here will try and give you shit if your panels are older than 3 years? you've got to be kidding me..... dude most people who are selling there's may have used them a lot don't get me wrong use with anything will wear it out if your wearing it every single day 365 a year but if you wear it ever so often and it just sits and you bought it knew it should last a very long time if not indefinitely forever . 


it has been proven the expiration date on some of these panels is a ploy by the company's to get you to continue buying there Armour. 

i myself have shot a 17 year old vest 10 times in the desert and it held up fine till that 10th shot with a .40 and a .9mm so i don't care to hear these lies you will try and speak to me to go and get me to try and sell my personal belongings for cheaper.

and funny thing is they will try and back it up by saying ohh im an x cop/military personal and i know because i had to wear one all the time.

well thats funny seems to me like they only do that to keep up with the newer and better technology that comes out. the lighter it gets with the same grade of protection of coarse there going to get new ones to get even more protection even more lighter and even more un noticable. 



point being said people, use freakin common sense when buying bullet proof material if you actually THINK theres a possiblity for whatever reason you get shot dont by something that seems like its been worn or that it is old and used up stick with something heavy duty you want to make sure that a bullet will not penetrate when you put your life on the line."

Please beware of bullet proof vests that are older than 3 years!!!!! Especially buying them from someone that can't even spell - that should be enough of an alarm letting you know the seller has probably never spent any time in one!!!
 Most manufacturers recommend panel replacement after 3 years - some recommend after 2 year. The Genius on here said to me ""the fiber doesn't break down"" obviously he's never worn one in the heat of the summer and doesn't know what sweat will do to a Kevlar panel. If nothing else Gentlemen - if you HAVE to buy used - please be sure the panels are at least under 3 years old, have no stains on them and the outside cover(s) are not coming apart.

So, now I am going to re-post it.

Japanese/Browning A Bolt II in .270
Comes with NIKON 3-9X40 scope.
Blueing is in great shape.  Just the usual rub marks from Deer hunting.  The bolt is silky smooth and the bore is excellent.  This gun is dead-nuts on @100 yards and beyond.
I'm tossing in a new box of Federal Power shok ammo too.
This gun has been refinshed at some time, but still is a handsome rifle and would be a great hunting companion.

Not interested in selling at this time unless you flash me an amount that intrigues me into selling.

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

There are two types of these replicas: One type is made in China and of very poor quality, the other is made in Germany in the same factory and same casts as original Hitler youth knifes. This knife is the type made in Germany. This knife is the exact same as someone in the Hitler Youth would receive during the third reich. The blade is very strong and says ""Blut und Ehre!""(""Blood and Honor!"" in German). It has some slight surface discoloration(was like that when I bought it but I never bothered polishing it) which should be easily polished off. The blade has some marks from when I pulled it out fast or put in back in the frog fast. It has a slight chip on the sheath(also like that when I bought it). I bought it because I've always been interested in WW2 and, unfortunately, I have to sell it because I recently bought a Rimfire rifle and need to sell some stuff.

with the barrel.  However, if you have a slug gun, you can put a field
barrel on it without having to change the forearm.   This is why I bought
the slug gun specifically and bought the bird barrel separately (I didn't
want to have to mess with matching forearms to barrels).  In addition, the
receiver of the slug gun is drilled and tapped to add a scope.

I have the hard case, instructions, owner's manual, chokes (including a
turkey choke that I bought separately). I do hunt with the gun, so it does have minimal wear and tear, but is in excellent shape. 

My pictures are too large and I don't know how to re-size them - so I would be happy to email pictures upon request.

Finally, the transfer has to be through an FFL.

Please let me know if you have any questions."

These sighting adjustments allow the shooter to customize sighting and achieve a greater level of accuracy. The 3-9x40 premium scope offers fully-coated optics, 1/4 in. MOA (minute of angle) adjustments to the point-of impact for both windage and elevation, as well as positive clicking for locked-in adjustment of the reticules.

Fired 30 rnd, no problems, minor scope adj made and put it up. The upper is 3 months old, under warranty and described as: Custom 16"" Hbar 1x9 Moly Gas Block Post Ban configuration Complete Flat Top, Picatinny rail gas block. item number: UCJSE16005 from JSE surplus. Weapon fire flawless, lower was older Century Arms Sporter, I did research and found they were decommissioned Colts, no wear. Clean, looks good works perfect. Stock and add ons, grips etc. are imported from Israel. Stock is 4 position ( 34 1/2"", 33 3/4"", 33"", 31 1/2"" total length) with compartment for batteries, etc. and trigger grip has storage too. All are new as is buffer and spring. 
These weapons go for $1000 to $2500 without the ammo and mods.. I have dozens of low ball offers and people trying to use me as a trade up. I have the price much lower than shops, way lower than online with shipping and FFA. I'll work some, but when this ad expires, so does this rifle. In these dark days, I'm amazed that nobody has snapped this up, and after seeing some of the prices others have them listed for, I'm very amazed. Last chance is looming. Hope we don't have another ban.

I built this weapon with one thing in mind. What would I improve over what I was issued in the Army? Got some ideas from Sons of Guns, but had to order special parts over time and as the prices went down. I wanted it right. Stripping my weapons down hundreds if not thousands of times in the Army took away the guess work. Even the scope was right dead on when  mounted . I didn't state that in the original ad, people think you're full of crap unless you explain how well you know those weapons from years of training. I shot mine so well in the service that I was volunteered to show Officers how to fire theirs safely and accurately, West Point was lagging in weapons training.
Back on track, the weapon is $1500-$2500 easy if you got it from a store or online. I bought a complete AR15 CA Sporter, found out is was a decommissioned Colt, and stripped it down for overhaul and conversion to a M-4. Only thing I kept was the lower, rebuilt it and built everything else around it new and better. Then finding the upper I wanted, heavy duty giving it balance and allows for the grip at the magazine and better heat dissipation as well. And there's room to build it up more and keep the balance, add lazer, light, etc .. New heavy duty  buffer and spring completes the lowers rebuilt and pretty much elimination that jerky recoil even at it's lowest extension. The Israelis know what the heck they are doing and the parts are second to no one! If it doesn't sell ts time, it's mine, period.

It has a safety behind trigger(I forgot what it's called, it's like in a Marlin model 60), and the safety automatically goes on after being shot and does not engage until bolt is pulled open. The gun works flawlessly and is really fun to shoot. The only reason I am selling it is because I recently bought a Glenfield Model 60 and need to sell some things to make up for the credit card damage. I love this air rifle but, now that I am in Charleston, I never use it. It also comes with ~400 Crossman Hollow point .177 pellets. This gun is in mint condition. The only annoyance is that I wrote my initials in whiteout and then tried to remove it and ended up smearing it. But it's an easy fix, I'm just lazy at the moment. Also, there is a whiteout snow camo style on the front of left side of stock. This is also an easy fix. Other than that, this gun is flawless.

I purchased this gun new on 3/21/2012 (have receipt to prove it) and shortly thereafter purchased my first Les Baer 1911.  After holding and shooting the Baer, I realized that custom 1911's were the guns for me, and have not even touched this gun since (except today to take these pictures).

This 5-inch stainless E-series is brand new, and absolutely unfired.  Other than the factory test round (which is still sealed in the envelope), it has never had a round chambered or a loaded mag in it.  There is not a nick, scrape or scratch anywhere on the frame or slide.  It is exactly as it was when I brought it home.  The original case, paperwork, lock, test round casing and both 8-round magazines are included, and everything is in perfect condition as well.  The MSRP on this gun is $1300, and they can be purchased new for about $1150 (which is what I paid for it).  I am knocking $150 off of that price for nothing more than bringing it from the store to my house.

I have 15 very high resolution photos of the gun that I can send to an interested buyer.

I would be interested in a partial trade for a S&W 4505 or 4506 or a 10mm S&W 1006.  I prefer one with adjustable sights, and it must be in very nice to perfect condition.  Not interested in any beat up duty guns.

I also purchased an all black, commander length, Scandium framed E-series 1911 exactly 1 week (also have receipt) after I purchased the gun in this listing.  It is also NIB and unfired, and I will be listing it here as well in the next day or so.

Please don't bother contacting me if you are ineligible to buy a handgun in the state of Ohio for any reason.  I will need to see an Ohio driver's license or CCW at the time of purchase to make sure you are an Ohio resident.  Face-to-face cash deal only.  I live about 15 minutes West of the Akron Canton Airport, and would be willing to travel no more than an hour to make the sale."

Can you shoot 4 MOA rapid fire without a bipod or rest?  Can you do it with a rack-grade rifle and surplus ammo?  Can you do it with iron sights?  Join us for an Appleseed Rifle Marksmanship clinic and find out.

See if you can answer these questions - which every American who loves his country should be able to answer:
1. When and where was the American Revolution won, according to John Adams?
2. When and where did the Revolutionary War break out?
3. What caused the British Regulars, the most well-trained, well-disciplined army in the world, to break and run at Concord's North Bridge, after only two minutes of musket fire by shopkeepers and farmers?
4.  What caused this reversal of British military opinion:

BEFORE April 19, 1775:
""Americans are raw, undisciplined and cowardly"". John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich and 1st Lord of the Admiralty 

""With a thousand British grenadiers I would undertake to go from one end of America to the other and geld all the males, partly by force and partly with a little coaxing"". Major General Alured Clarke 

AFTER April 19, 1775:
""Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself very much mistaken. They have men amongst them who know very well what they are about..."" Lieutenant-General Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland

Join us for the Appleseed Rifle Marksmanship Clinic, Sep 15-16, 2012 at the Mercer County Fish & Game Club in Harrodsburg, KY and find out the answers to these basic questions about our country's founding.

The MSRP on this firearm is $310 on Beretta's website.  I'm sure you already know, but Beretta makes extremely high quality firearms.  This one is small enough to fit in either your back or front pocket (with the pocket holster I am including), with a profile small enough to appear to be nothing more than a wallet.  Another cool feature of this firearm is that a small release will flip the barrel up similar to a hinge action firearm, making chambering the first round, or seeing if a round is chambered, extremely easy because you don't need to rack the slide.

I am including two holsters, which are worth at least $30 alone.  Also included will be the original box, one clip, the original gun lock, and the original receipt showing that I paid $242.49 just for the firearm almost six years ago.  I've taken excellent care of it, only taken it to the range to practice occasionally, and I would rate it as being in outstanding condition.  I've never had a failure to fire or failure to eject.  This is a firearm you can rely on for your protection if the situation ever arises.  You know what they say, ""a .22 in your pocket is better than a .45 at home in your gun cabinet"", and this is one that you will always feel comfortable carrying even with nothing more than shorts and a t-shirt.  This firearm has outstanding reviews, and I simply refuse to pay $150 for some no-name off-brand that might not go bang when it needs to.  I hope, like all firearm enthusiasts, that you're the same!

If you look at the safes at Fleet, you've probably seen the same model. It goes for about $400 there. I'm looking for $300 or best offer. 
It's built so that when it sits in the corner, the door faces the center of the room. Chicks dig it.  I'd say it holds about 12 long guns, and it has shelves that go in the back of it that you could set pistols or other gear on. You may want to rivet them in place or something, because I had a hard time getting them to stay up. If you don't feel like it, you could always take them out and lean another gun or two in the space it would free up. the floor and shelves are lined with foam. Black in color, has two locks on the door. Key-operated, no dial or number pad. Pretty basic, handy safe. 
It doesn't weigh too much, so it's easy to move. I can have it sitting outside and help you load it into your truck, or we can talk about delivery. I would appreciate a little something my way if you'd like me to bring it to you, though. That option is pretty much for locals only unless you make me a sweet deal.

Email is good, but you can also text me. I'd rather not be taking phone calls since while I'm at work and stuff.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"
