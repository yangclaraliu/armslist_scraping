This is NIB and has never been used. IF ADD IS UP I STILL HAVE IT! Here is the description:

The popular O-frame press is a strong design with a large opening and long-stroke that loads small centerfire to large magnum calibers with ease. Its spent-primer catcher tube routes spent primers directly to a trash container. Lee’s Lever Prime System includes primer arms for both large and small primers and makes priming cartridges a snap. The Breech Lock Quick-Change System lets you change dies instantly with a twist of your wrist and you’ll never have to adjust your dies again. The sturdy all-steel linkage has an adjustable-length lever. Press includes three Breech Lock Quick-Change Die Bushings. Dies and shellholder not included.

This kit, components and a set of dies is all you need to reload any cartridge. Kit includes: Breech Lock Challenger Press, Perfect Powder Measure with stand, Safety Powder Scale, powder funnel, case cutter with lock stud to trim cases, an inside/outside case neck chamfer/deburring tool, primer pocket cleaner, large and small safety prime primer feeders and a tube of premium resizing lube. You also get one Breech Lock Quick-Change Bushing. These bushings make changing dies a snap. NOTE: To use the case cutter and lock stud a specific shell holder and case length gauge is needed for each caliber to be trimmed."

It wears the 4-inch ventilated-rib barrel and has the adjustable rear sight. It has the original Colt factory finish and is in good condition overall but does have a few minor scattered rust freckles and one small area of rust pitting on the right side of the frame above trigger guard. The rubber grips have the gold Colt medallions and are in relatively good shape except for a small piece missing from the right panel at the top of the back strap. Excellent mechanics with proper timing, solid lock-up, and that butter-smooth Python action. The bore is excellent, bright with sharp rifling. It does not appear to me that this revolver has been fired all that much. According to the serial number, this revolver was manufactured in 1979."

The P6 is the West German Police version of the commercial Sig P225. The P6 has a heavier double action pull (12lbs) and a different hammer, but is essentially the same pistol. This pistol shows holster wear, but very little wear on the internal parts. The bore is bright and clean. This is a great shooter, light and slim, easy for any size hands, great for teaching new shooters or keeping costs down with 9mm ammunition. This is a ""numbers matching"" P6, meaning the barrel, slide and frame are all factory original. This P6 will come with two factory Sig Sauer magazines (8 rounds), factory box and a new spare replacement magazine spring. I have already replaced the springs in both magazines with extra power wolff springs. Sig Sauer pistols have that to hell and back reliability and this pistol is no different. Read the P6 and P225 reviews and see for yourself. I am selling because I'm just ready for a change.

This is a two tone Bersa Thunder in the original box with the papers with both keys for the built in lock,a new cable lock and a Fobus Holster and a soft carrying case.I actually like this gun much more than my ruger LCP but I decided to keep the LCP and sell this one only because the LCP is smaller and easier to hide on a motorcycle.
I'm looking to purchase a Taurus Judge or something for home protection...also interested in possably a LC9 or other 9mm not as a pocket gun but more a nightstand gun. So if you have any of the above and are looking for a nice concealed carry gun let me know and lets see if we can work out a deal that makes us both happy.I have cash to make up the difference if your selling a Judge.

We accept USPS money orders and PayPal.

This is the newest model in the family of “No-Gunsmith” Mosin Nagant scout scope mounts. It replaces the rear sight and features a high tensile cross bolt and nut that fits completely through the mount to lock it into place. No more stripped threads or broken screws. 

Restore your rifle to its original configuration by unbolting the mount and reinstalling the rear sight. Fits most models, including the Russian M91/30 & M91/38 rifles, Finnish M27, M28 and M91/30 rifles and all versions of the M-38, M-44, M53 and M56 carbines. Use with Weaver style rings (not included) to mount Hologram, Red Dot and extended eye relief (EER) scopes. 

Earlier model mounts were designed with two short bolts that threaded into the sides of the mount through the rear sight base ears. With extended shooting these bolts could strip out the threads in the mount and it would become loose. This new Scope Mount has been threaded completely through and fitted with a full length threaded cross bolt and locking nut that securely attaches the scope mount to the rear sight base.

I did a lot of reading on m4carbine.net when I was in the process of building this gun, and was very careful with what parts went in to this.  There is a lot of great info on the above website for anybody that is not familiar with these guns.  Like I mentioned above, the barrel is chambered for 5.56 and not just .223 ammo and also has the m4 feed ramps instead of the rifle feed ramps.  The stock has been properly staked, as to not let the stock ring come lose.  The bolt carrier group has also been staked properly.

These were not sniper rifles, but standard combat model rifles for use in the field. The solution was to modify the rifle to accept a ""scout scope"" with an extended eye relief and mounted forward of the action.

Surplus Mauser military rifles are readily available today and many shooters have opted to use telescopic sights on these rifles. Until recently, this involved drilling and tapping the receiver, bending the bolt and modifying the stock - an expensive modification to a collectible rifle. 

This easy installation, ""no gunsmithing"" mount replaces the rear sight leaf. Simply remove the rear sight leaf and spring, insert and bolt in the mount. Attach Weaver style rings (not included) to the Picatinny mount and install your favorite Hologram, Red Dot or extended eye relief (EER) scope. Restore the rifle to its original configuration by unbolting the mount and reinstalling the rear sight.

             I have for sale a browning .22 LR SA-22 take-down (IS). This is the best example that i can find to compare it to the rifle sitting next to me. Iv only had it for 2 years but has been in protective storage.
i have legitiment pictures and a seriel # for sereouse buyers. To find one in my condition is extremely rare according to a few gun store owners. They stopped making them in 1974 and only either the clean collectibles, or the rusted over used rifles that were treated poorly. All of the SA-22 take-downs that are going to be on the market, have already been around for 37 years, and are not going to get any cheaper! fortunatly mine is a clean collectible with no deffects whats so ever. Like i said this is the best example i have until i can load up a few pictures real soon atleast by may 5TH...
