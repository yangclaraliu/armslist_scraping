Walther PPKS - 435
Fobus holster - 20
IWB holster for conceal carry - 15

This is all priced fair. Lowballers need not email or contact, it won't happen. The price is fair, I am not hurting for money, and am just selling to get something else, so if it won't sell at a fair price I will just keep it.

It has an M4 style 6 position stock with a pistol grip for a handle with built in finger grooves. installed on the stock is a buttpad specifically for that stock and a six shell holser made specifically foe that stock. The cool thing about this stock is that it can be depleted down to just the pistol grip with no problem and unlike other stocks i have seen that do that it is firm both ways. The pump or forrend part of the gun has been converted to a pistol grip that allows for steady shooting and a better more natural_ hold of the gun.

I would say the gun can be said to be in 95% condition, one small mark on the front sight. The bore and cylinder show no wear at all. I was told by the person that gave it to me that it was never shot, but only factory fired.

These were the first airsoft guns brought into the US and were made back in 1987-88 and only sold for 1 year until they were pulled from stores because of how much they resemble the real guns (kids where being held at gunpoint by police officers because of the realism of these replicas). Since this all airsoft guns now require permenant orange tips on the barrel ends or must be a non-gun color, to distinguish ""toys"" from real firearms.

These airsoft guns fire standard airsoft bb's HOWEVER the bb's are loaded into lifesize 9mm shells and are loaded into an actual magazine! You pump the gun, the bb shoots out and the shell ejects, just like a real gun.
This is a very high quality item, metal and plastic parts and originally sold for $70 back in the 80's!

The gun for sale is as mint as you are going to ever find one. This is New Old Stock, never removed from the box, still has the zip-tie holding the bolt forward, all the shells, targets, manual, sling, bb's, and everything it originally came with. 99% condition, the other 1% is light shelf wear on the box, which will happen to any item sitting on a store shelf.

I am the original owner,. The gun was purchased with original stock along with the steel folder. The folder may be a Falcon, but there are no markings, so I have been led to believe it might be a product made for Ruger. The distributor was offering the folder at the time.

The folder is 99% identical to the folder on the Ruger ACK-556 I owned. This may have been a folder from a talked about about contract for folders, which Ruger eventually terminated when they produced their own. I don't know. Either way, it is a beautiful manufacture, and works flawlessly and easily.

The gun comes with a good, but storage affected box. I may have the papers in a box in storage, and will add them if they can be located, before the sale or later.

This gun has never been fired, nor has a round ever been chambered. The original stock comes with the gun if the buyer wants it. It is also in as new condition.

This is not your typical gun show bruiser or CMP rack grade gun. Those are good guns to, this one is better though :) No import marks. Parts are somewhat of a mixed bag, Bolt is HRA, seems to be some Winchester in there somewhere also. I dont have a gauge but I believe the muzzle wear is quite minimal based off the ""bullet test"" Have not tested the throat. Bore is about a 8.5 out of 10 probably.

My arbitrary price of $1000 was apparently much too high for most everyone, so we'll try this completely arbitrary price for a while.

I have a Modernized MAK-90 AK that I'm looking to get rid of. I have put a lot of time and money into this rifle and am looking to get some of that back. The reason I'm selling it is to get an AR. If you have an entry level AR with a chrome barrel and chamber I may be interested in a trade. If you have one with a bit more than the basics I also have and XDm in two-tone OD/Black I could throw in (trust me, it's not going to go easy... like an $1800 trade because of how much I love the pistol). I may also be able to include a Mosin Nagant, not really looking to get rid of it, but it is a possibility.

Now, this is not a cheap firearm to begin with, on top of that I have upgraded and updated it to be sure that it is 922r compliant. Do NOT offer me $500. That's insulting and I will just turn you down. It does have a quad rail fore end and it works perfectly, every time. The ONLY thing it really needs is a new finish (very worn, mild rust pitting, etc) due to neglect from a previous owner.

If you buy it, you will get the rifle, three European steel mags and five Tapco mags. The rifle comes as it's set up with a Bushnell TRS-25 red dot (great, inexpensive red dot), Midwest rail system, Tapco stock (collapsible), Tapco grip and Tapco trigger group.

I have put about 630 rounds through the rifle (give or take) and have not had a single issue with the rifle. It is VERY accurate and holds a zero (through about 350 rounds) perfectly. I have it sighted in at approximately 30 yards, maybe 35 (done at my range here at my house without a range finder or anything).

Email me for pictures of the rifle. Email me with offers. 

Please bear in mind, that if you buy this and spend $300 more you will have a super reliable weapon that looks good and has all you need for a SHTF or home defense rifle.

This rifle is not the accu-trigger model, just before they started that.  It does have a Tasco 3x9 scope, bipod, sling and will come with one 10 round magazine.  It only has maybe 500 rounds through it and is in very good shape with the wood stock.  It has the heavier barrel but not the bull barrel.  I am not interested in selling it, trade only for a pump shotgun.  What I really want is a tactical style with 18"" barrel and pistol grip but will entertain all offers, worst I will say is no thank you.  But the shotgun must be a pump, 12 ga and in good shape.  This Savage is worth in the 200-250 range so your shotgun must be in the same neighborhood.  I am only looking for a straight up trade, no cash on either side.  Please no New Englands, H and R's or other department store models.  Prefer Mossberg, Remington, Winchester or Savage.  Thank you for looking!"

Clear title in hand and sold as is.
Email REDACTED
Selling my 2002 Dodge Caravan with approximately 120,650 miles. Blueish gray color with gray interior. 4 door (no power rear doors). Power windows and locks. 
The trans went out a year ago and I had it completely rebuilt by a local shop. I started having trans problems and of course the place went out of business. I narrowed it down to the TCM (trans control module) and ordered a new one. Put it in and the spedo started jumping around. I changed the speed sensors and it didn't correct the problem so sometimes it wants to start in 2td gear and I'm sick of working on it so I priced it accordingly. 
The good is
Rebuilt trans with about 5k miles
New TCM less then 100 miles
Newer tires
Radiator 1.5yrs old.
Clean interior
No rust 

The bad
spedo jumps around when you are stopped but once moving it works fine
Driver window motor went out and will be a easy fix. 
Brakes need done but the rotors are one brake job old and the pads have lifetime warranty. Rear shoes have lifetime warranty. Both from autozone. 
Paint is bubbleing on the edge of hood but not peeling. 
Scratchs and small dents around it 

Trans shifts fine but a few times if the speedo was bouncing at 20 it wanted to start in 2tdvbut I let off the gas and it went to 1st and was fine. This has happened a few times not all the time. 

I am firm on price as this is a 3td vehicle for us so it don't cost us much to keep. And its had $2000 in trans work and TCM in it in the past year.

Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty.  The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

The gun is very accurate for an AK pattern rifle, and it also features a chrome lined barrrel (16""). Besides the bolt assembly, all the internals have been replaced with Tapco parts in order to remain 922r compliant. The gun features a G2 trigger group (polished by Dinzag Arms, the trigger pull is significantly better than standard AK's). I put a Tapco retaining plate in the gun, and the trigger guard is from Dinzag Arms. All of the holes which remained from conversion are filled with nylon plugs, also from Dinzag. The rear stock and pistol grip are by Tapco, and the gun features a tactical fore end (rail system) which also will retain a solid zero if optics are installed. The gun has had a Dinzag bullet guide installed...for those unfamiliar with Saiga rifles this is a feature which is necessary for high capacity magazines. I'm including the factory Saiga magazine with the gun, but aftermarket high capacity mags can be used with this rifle (I can't guarantee a drop in fit with every mag, some may need minor fitting to properly seat). The dust cover has been replaced by a mil spec ribbed version."

I love this pistol, but I have too many CC guns and need to slim down the collection (according to my wife).  Please call or text me at REDACTED if interested.  I've been asked if I didn't like this handgun - I own two Ruger LC9s and selling only one.  I believe the Ruger LC9 is a near perfect conceal carry handgun (minus the manual safety and all the added safety features) for a single stack 9mm.  I own a Kahr PM9 as well, which has a better trigger than the LC9, but I can group much better with the LC9 - especially at distances near 10 yards.

These old model vaqueros are heavier, and just plain better built. Both have been smoothed and slicked for cowboy action shooting, trigger jobs, and are smooth as butter. 

Regular gripped model will also come with simulated stag grips, and also wood grips.

Bought these bad boys to get into cowboy shooting, but my schedule just wont allow for another hobby, I can barely get out to shoot paper targets...
