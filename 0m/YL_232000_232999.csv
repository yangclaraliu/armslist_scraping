The only markings on it are ""FIRESTAR"" on the right side of the slide toward the muzzle; ""STAR EIBAR SPAIN"" and the Star logo on the left side of the frame near the muzzle; ""INTERARMS ALEXANDRIA VIRGINIA"" on the left side of the receiver near the muzzle; ""CAL. .40 S&W"" on the chamber end of the barrel, visible through the ejection port; and the serial number 2108XXX on the right-rear of the receiver. Although it is not so-marked, this is a model M40 pistol.

It's about 6-1/2"" long, 4-5/8"" high (+1/8"" with 6-round magazine or +1/2"" with 7-round magazine), about 1-1/4"" wide and about 29.5 oz unloaded, 34.7 oz loaded with six 180-gn .40 rounds. Barrel length is about 3.3"". The weapon is all steel with black rubber grips. All contact surfaces are checkered – grip including front and rear surfaces, recurve of the trigger guard, hammer, slide release, magazine release, safety, and both sides of the slide – except the trigger, which is smooth. The finish is in good shape, obviously not new, but clearly not abused. The barrel is in good shape, in fact you can see the rifling quite prominently in one of the pictures. Front sight is a blade adjustable for windage, looks like it had a dot in it once but not now, just an indentation. Rear sight with two white dots, adjustable for windage at least. Single action only, with a fairly light, crisp trigger.

Sale includes four magazines as shown – two 6-rounders and two extended 7-rounders. The extended magazines do increase the overall size of the gun, but also improve the grip size. Also with the gun is an adjustable Uncle Mike's Sidekick holster, which can be used either left-or right-handed, inside the waist or outside. The holster includes a pocket for an additional magazine. It feels compact and solid and I think it would be a good choice for concealed carry.

The 9mm and .45ACP models of this pistol are far more common, in fact I could find no comparable sales of the M40 in this finish. Based on the completed sales records I could find of other Star pistols, I will offer this pistol with the four magazines and holster at $350."

Those serial # were 534000/599000.- ""mine has #'s in that range""
After the 8 September 1943 armistice between Italy and the Allies, the Germans saddled Beretta with three engineers from Germany. Moreover the factory was garrisoned by the SS... Weapons of that time, even the ones produced for the Germans, bore the punch mark 4UT
(Quarto Ufficio tecnico di Controllo Armi e Munizioni--4th Technnical Control Unit
  an C. Still, in Axis Pistols, page 107, states,
""It is likely that almost all of the 4/UT, ...were used by the German Army"". He also includes two other variations in this statement, ""1944 dated and blank slide Model 1935"".
  Ugo Menchini, in Pietro Beretta Le Automatiche, regarding an M1934, page 255, states,
""In late 1940 there appears an oval including the punch mark IVU. It refers to the 4th technical Control Unit of the FAG, where inspection was carried out.""
 Note that, while they seem to represent the same inspectors, the ""IVU"" is not 
the same mark as the ""4UT"". The IVU would be found on the pre RSI model M1934, and the 4UT would be found on the RSI model M1935.
These are the reasons why I believe that it is likely that all of the 4UT Berettas were RSI pistols.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

First is an Hakim rifle in 8mm. This is basically a Swedish Ljungman rifle made for egypt. It is magazine fed, semi-auto, uses a direct impingement system similar to AR's, and has an excellent muzzle break to help with recoil. Very accurate with irons.

Second is an FR-8 in .308:
These are Spanish made bolt action carbines constructed from 8mm Mauser actions for .308. They were a stop gap measure before the CETME could be introduced. They are very short, and make excellent brush guns. Has a NATO flash hider and a fake gas tube up front to store a cleaning kit.
I've put 20 rounds through it since I've had it and it seems to be very accurate with open sights for within 100 yards. I haven't tried the adjustable peep sights which range out farther.

I have a little over 100 rounds of 8mm to go with the Hakim and a 3 boxes of ammo to go with the FR-8.

I's like to see these gone; they're taking up too much room in my cabinet, and I have no use for either one. I'm going for a trade value of $700. The Hakim's generally go for about 500 and the FR-8's for about 350 or more.

Springer Precision has coupled their XD Sear and a host of springs for the benefit of improving the XD's stock trigger. With this pairing of parts, you are one step closer to a full-house trigger job. The results of the kit is a shorter, lighter, crisper trigger pull.

With World War I looming and a subsequent shortage of M1911 pistols apparent, S&W and Springfield Armory began a joint project to develop a “half-moon” steel clip for the large-frame Second Model that would hold three of the rimless .45 ACP cartridges, thus enabling them to be engaged by the extractor. As a fail-safe, S&W “step” machined the cylinder chambers to maintain proper headspace on the case mouths, enabling .45 ACPs to be fired without the clips, although cases would have to be removed individually."

I'd say that's a good policy if what you're buying has been used very little and is in excellent condition.

Well this rifle has been used very little and is in excellent to like new condition.  Made in Finland. I bet you haven't felt a smoother bolt. You tilt the gun up and down and it just slides under it's own weight.  I have fired it less than 50 times during sighting in, and busting 2 liter bottles of water on a few occasions.  I meticulously cleaned and oiled the bore after every of the few sessions.

The $500 price is for the rifle, rings and mounts.  They are Burris bases, and if I remember correctly the rings are Millett, or they may be Burris as well, I don't remember.  

If you want the scope included which was also purchased brand new from SWFA, I will make you a deal on that too.  Here's the link to the scope:

http://swfa.com/Burris-3-9x40-Fullfield-E1-Rifle-Scope-P48175.aspx

Check out the etched, floating reticle.. I love this scope.  As you can see, the scope sells for about 200 bucks (plus shipping?). I will leave it attached for an additional $150.  It is dead on zeroed, ready for the field right now.  Burris has a lifetime warranty on these scopes.

So basically, you are getting a like new rifle for well over $100 off, and a new scope (already zeroed) for $50 off, plus much better than factory rings and bases for free.  

I can travel some distance to meet you if you are a serious buyer.  Some trades may be considered, sale is preferred. To recap:

Rifle + rings/bases = $500
Above + scope = $650

I will consider offers if this doesn't sell right away, but as for now I have considered everything and am firm on the prices.

This particular rifle was built in the mid-50's, toward the end of the 88's run. It has the Microgroove barrel, and shoots very accurately. This is a full-sized rifle, not a medium or small .22 like most you find. It hold 14 rounds in the butt stock tube magazine.

Cosmetically, it could use some cleaning up. The stock has some dings and dents you would expect with a .22 that's been around for half a century, and the steel could stand to be re-blued. It is far from terrible, but it's not perfect. It functions well, but can be a little picky with ammo. I have found it likes the Remington ""Golden Bullets"" best.

Will travel for the right deal. Of most interest would be a .22 revolver. Can add cash to the right trade. Thanks for looking!"

The Receiver and Bore are in excellent condition and she has the hard to find “suicide safety”. This was the sliding safety that goes front-back through the trigger guard. 
As with all Browning A5 16 gauges of this age, it was originally manufactured for 2  9/16 shotgun shells that were popular in Europe at the time. It was converted by Browning to accept  the now-standard 2-3/4"" shells. I even have 2 boxes of high brass 16 gauge, 6 shot shells to throw in to the trade."

I would also entertain a handgun trade for your 10mm. I AM WILLING TO ADD UP TO $200 ON TOP OF THE HAND GUN AND AMMO FOR THE RIGHT TRADE.   PM or text me REDACTED with questions or offers."

The majority of these guns were purchased new by me and the majority of them have never been fired. I simply bought them and put them in the safe. I posted these before and had a sudden change of heart and decided not to sell them. However, my wife and I have found some property that we would like to purchase. So I am listing these for sale again. I may consider trades as well. Multiple guns trades are ok. I have a variety of interests when it comes to firearms so please make offers. I will consider trades plus cash as well. It really just depends on what you have. I am an ak guy by heart but will consider other trades as well. Below is a list of all of the guns that I am offering for sale or trade. There is also a variety of ammunition for sale as well. I also have a very extensive and valuable collection of autographs for sale. This is my personal collection and I have put this collection together over the years. This is an amazing collection for any baseball fan. The total autograph collection is valued at over $20,000. I also have these items listed below. All of the autographs have proper documentation and certificates of authenticity. I prefer cash but I will consider trades on these items as well. My asking price for the entire collection is $5,500. This would make an excellent investment opportunity for someone. This autograph collection is worth much more. You could easily triple your money if you had the time to sell the items individually. I just don't have the time. These must go as soon as possible. No reasonable offers will be refused on the autograph collection.  These must go as soon as possible. Send me your best offer. I must sell these items rather quickly because I do not want the property that we are planning on purchasing to be sold. We really need the money for a larger down payment. I will consider trades and cash offers, but please be reasonable. The autograph collection must go as soon as possible. I would prefer to sell the firearms quickly as well, but it isn't a neccessity. Thanks for looking. 

GUNS: 

Custom Saiga 12 Guage Shotgun
Price: $1350
This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri mail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling mount, finger groove pistol grip, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga.

Winchester 94 AE Lever Action 30/30
Price: $425
This is a nearly prefect example of Winchester's famous lever action rifle. This 94 AE is chambered in 30/30 and has seen very little usage. I have fired this rifle very little and used it as a brush gun during hunting season only a few select times. This gun is in excellent condition and is the closest thing that you will find to new. 

Remington 770 30/06 bolt action rifle
Price: $325
I purchased this rifle a few years ago and never actually fired the rifle. I took it out one time with me hunting but never had the opportunity to fire it. This rifle is chambered in 30/06 and comes with a 3-9x40 scope mounted. The scope has never even been sighted in. It also has a camo sling mounted. This would make a perfect deer rifle for someone. 

DPMS AR-15 20"" A2 target rifle with stainless bull barrel
Price: $1,050
This rifle is the most accurate AR that I have ever shot. This is a DPMS AR-15 with an A2 stock and a 20 inch long, 1 inch diameter stainless bull barrel. This rifle has a free floating barrel and a free floating DPMS handguard, forward assist, and dust covers. The rifle also has a 6-24x44 scope that has not been sighted in. The scope has been mounted on a top rail scope mount. The rifle also has a bipod mounted. This rifle has a railed gas block and will come with two magazines as well. The stock has a few knicks and dings but nothing major. This came from shooting on a bench. The gun has been fired very little and hasn't been fired since I mounted the scope. 

Glock 22 40 S&W in OD Green
Price:$500
This is a brand new Glock and has never been fired. This is a Gen 3 glock and will come with two factory hi-capacity glock mags. I purchased this gun when I learned that Glock would no longer release any OD green glocks. I can include a blackhawk carbon fiber holster and two KCI extreme capacity glock mags for an additional $75. I believe they are 31 rounders but I am not positive. The last OD green gen 3 glock that was new in the box sold for over $500 with $25 shipping plus ffl fees on Gunbroker. This is going to be a collector's item very soon. Especially in unfired condition. 

Sig Sauer Platinum Elite 1911
Price:$1100
This is the most beautiful 1911 that you have ever seen. This pistol has never been fired. I purchased it about a year ago and placed it in my safe. This gun has night sites installed. Checkered grip, beavertail grip safety, and many other custom features. This is a beautiful pistol and would make an excellent carry weapon or one to put up as an heirloom. This is the highest end of Sig Sauer 1911's and they are getting harder and harder to find. Comes with 2 sig sauer factory mags.

Sig Sauer 2022 9mm
Price:$450
This gun is brand new in the box and has never been fired. I purchased this gun and put it in my safe. This gun is chambered in 9mm and is meant to outlast most of your other standard 9mm pistols. This will come with an extra grip that fits larger hands and one high capacity magazine. This is a compact carry gun that is in new condition. Reliability will never be an issue with this pistol. I own another of this model and have shot it regularly. It is a great pistol for the money. 

I will follow the law when selling any of my pistols or rifles. Please do not try to buy a gun from me if you are a felon or cannot possess a firearm. 


Autograph Collection
Price: $5500 or best offer

This collection is valued at over $20,000. I have much much more than my asking price invested in this collection. I am simply trying to move this collection quickly in order to put a down payment on a piece of property. I may consider trades on a few items but I really prefer cash on these autographs. I would like to sell the entire collection all at once because time is limited on my end. This would be perfect for someone to resale on ebay or for an avid collector. I simply don't have the time to sell these items individually so the first person with a reasonable cash offer will take the entire collection. I am only asking $5500 for the entire collection. You won't find a collection like this everyday, especially at this price. Below is a list of every item in my collection. I have also listed prices for what each item typically sells for. Keep in mind, I am only asking a fraction of these prices. $5500 is an absolute steal for a collection like this. I may consider shipping this collection at the buyer's expense. All of my autographs have been authenticated and all come with certificates of authenticity. Thanks for looking.

The total value of this autograph collection is around $24,265. I am only asking a fraction of this price. I am asking $5500 for the entire autograph collection. This is the best price that you will ever find. As I said, I need to sell this collection as soon as possible so please feel free to make reasonable offers. This would make an excellent investment opportunity for anyone that had the time to sell the items individually. You could really make a good bit of profit if you know how to use Ebay. I have photos of all of the autographs and all of the guns. I have tried to post a few photos of the guns on here but the files are too large. Feel free to email me for photos of the autographs or the guns. Thanks for looking."
