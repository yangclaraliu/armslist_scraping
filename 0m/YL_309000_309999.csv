- Wilson bulletproof spring set

The gun is in pristine firing condition, and shoots tight groups. It has been carried,(tucker gunleather holster) so it has a few signs of wear. These small signs are why I can't sell it for top value. If you'd like the gun without the mags, and grips, I'll do $1000. Let me know if you have any questions, I am available at all times of the day.

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.

The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.

This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.

The MR556A1 is manufactured in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system.

The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled.

The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems.

Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life.

But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore.

Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy.

The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy.

A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance.

Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition.

The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product.

The MR556A1 rifle is now available. Suggested Retail is $3,295 (includes rifle, HK 30-round steel magazine, set of HK diopter sights, HK multi-tool, lock, and case)."

This webpage has some detailed history of the pistol:  http://www.nrvoutdoors.com/ENFIELD%20SNUB/ENFIELD%20SNUB.htm.  In the first photograph on the left margin (with the red velvet background), my pistol is almost identical to the one in the middle.

This would also account for this pistol's pristine condition.

It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety."

The rifle breaks down much like the M16/AR series of rifles.  there are not any videos, that i could find, of this rifle on the internet, or instructions on how to field strip it, it is pretty simple and i will be more than happy to show anyone interested how to do everything on it.  i will include a few pictures and have many detailed pictures if you want more.   email me with questions and/or offers, serious inquiries only please, i dont want to show it off to a bunch of people just becasue theyve never see one.  keep in mind this is a very rare collectable firearm and  ITS VALUE WILL ONLY GO UP.  im in no hurry to get rid of it as i really like it, just the only rifle i have in 5.56 and i try to keep the different round types minimal.

I bought this brand new from Cabelas just 2 weeks ago. I have since decided to get a smaller gun for concealed carry (CZ P01) and a bigger gun (CZ 75 SP01 Shadow Target) for USPSA shooting. Thus, this fine firearm is now available. It is hard to find and this one is perfect. Less than 50 rounds have been put through it.

This firearm is completely stock except I put in the Cajun Gun Works FP-RP, which is the replacement firing pin retaining pin. Here is their description… - “This is a super hard micro-grain carbide (RC-92) firing pin retaining pin.  You can dry-fire all you want since this pin will never be damaged or break.  LIFETIME WARRANTY.” 

Can sell FTF or can ship. Can take Paypal.  $600 or best offer.

I have several things I could trade for:

1a) '71 honda trail bike. its currently in parts because my father was attempting to restore it, but due to health problems was unable to finish his project. I have all the parts except a chain and key (I have the title for the bike to prove its legal and legit. my grandfather gave it to my father when my parents got married.) This bike is rare, and to find one with no rust, no dents, and almost all parts is very rare. This bike sells for about $1200 when fully put together.

1b) 350cc honda vtwin motor with frame (not sure what year it is. it was also a project bike my father was working on, but unfortunately I do not have as many of the parts for the build.) I will let both of the bikes go for a single trade if the trade is worth it.

2) Jaguar diesel garden tractor with hydrolic 5ft deck. I have many spare parts off of a salvaged Jaguar to go along with it. This garden tractor is a BEAST. It is basically a bush-hog attached to a lawn mower. Unlike the bikes, this is fully put together and currently runs and mows like there's no tomorrow. (I previously lived on 3 acres and this would mow EVERYTHING in less than an hour.)

3) Yerf-dog 2 seater go-cart, fully put together. Was baught for me when I was younger, and has very little ride time. Great idea for kids or a project for a ""big-kid"". (you can put bike engines on these and turn them into rockets.)

4) I also have eight pure bred pitbull puppies that I'm currently selling for $500 a piece.

If you can help me out in anyway, I would really appreciate it! You can contact me at REDACTED. I can send pictures of these items either through email or text.

Thank you!"

I was told the value of it was $535-$575 by the guys at Denver Gun Room, where it is being sold on consignment for $525.  If you are certain you want the gun, I'll take it out of consignment and we can meet face to face and you can have it for $450, firm.   

I am open to trades- I'm looking for something fun and cheap to shoot like an AK.  If you really want to save some money I'll do an even trade for a EAA Zastava P.A.P. 7.62x39, which can be bought online, with shipping for about 370.  

The shotgun works beautifully and shells are readily available, even at Walmart.    I personally think 16ga is the perfect gueage for shotguns and if I actually had a need for a shotgun I certainly wouldn't be getting rid of it.  I just want something I'll use more often.

Production Sample - Prototype
AW-CAM1A

Designed for the 21st Century by Bob Terzuola, the Camillus 1A1 Bayonet was designed as the Camillus Cutlery entry for the XM8/Army/Marine Corp Bayonet upgrade project.

This bayonet meets all of the US Government specifications & design requirements, and then some.

The handle is dual overmolded polymer with a soft texture and multiple gripping surfaces. It is comfortable in both forward and reverse grips. The color is Coyote Brown with Loam Green grip panels on each side. An index finger notch has been incorporated for additional grip security in wet or slippery situations.

The blade measures 7.375"" and is made from the super rugged Camillus 0170-6C carbon steel. lt features a near full length double edge, with 2"" of serrations for extra cutting power on the primary edge. The double edge allows the weilder to cut in both directions while in combat, unlike the current single edge of the M9 bayonet.

The sheath is just as remarkable; featuring the same duo molded technology and a noise reduction panel on the front. Reversable for right or left hand use, the sheath also features a built in sharpening hone for field maintenance of the knife's cutting edge. The polymer sheath also houses the removable wire cutters with two different types of cutters, one sheer type cuts razor ribbon, the other cuts chain-link or barbed wire, and it has a spade type screw driver on the end. A quick release Bianchi clip attaches the sheath to standard military web belts, and the entire system can quickly be detached using the integral side release buckle.

The 1A1 XM8 Bayonet will fit all current standard US Military bayonet mounting hardware. 

General Specifications
Blade Length:: 7.375"" (partially serrated)
Overall Length:: 12.5""
Blade Steel:: 0170-6C
Handle Material:: Polymer
Sheath:: Polymer
Weight: 13oz 

Box, documents and a silicone cloth are all present with this knife.
This knife is very hard to find in this configuration and then as a complete set. The blade is Crazy sharp, it would cut the arm off a Zombie like a hot knife through butter!

These are a year and a half wait now...and not looking to lessen anytime soon. 
The SKS is a Chinese Parade (Police Dress?). Orignial woods stock, 10 round fixed magazine with spike bayonet. (inclouded).
The addons are the Shernic Bullpup stock, an SKS Magadapter (takes tapco 20 round mags with duck bill removed - straight in straight out mag changes like an AR) 4 tapco magazines are included. 2 modified for adapter, 2 stock 20rnd (I havent Modified them yet but this can be done with a dremel and modified mags as a template in about 10 minutes for both)
The front tri-rail is in place however, the rails have not shipped form shernic as they are behind production. I will pass them on if they come, but i bought a MagPul MOE 3 inch section and am going to use it instead. It too will come with rifle. 
So for this price you get the original stock, mag, bayonet, Chinese chest rig and NC star stripper clips, plus the 4 tapco mags (20 bucks a piece-modified were 25 a pece), sks mag adapter (100 buck new), Tri-rail mount, MOE rail with mounting hardware and all the pieces to adjust and work on or remove the Shernic kit. 
The total cost is pushing a grand. I have put around 300 rounds through SKS total since i bought it 11 years ago. It was meant to be a knock about gun but it sat in my closet till i put the Shernic on it. Now im back to not playing with it since i bought an MSAR bullpup.

He is only wanting to sell for cash to fund another purchase - so, no trades considered. He is not the original owner, so total round count is unknown. There have been approximately 200 rounds though it without any issues by his family.

The rifle is an FAL-H model 7.62x51 NATO (.308) assembled by Hesse manufacturing in St. Paul, MN with an Imbel receiver. It comes equipped with a built in bi-pod that folds neatly into the hand-guards, and a nice carry handle. The rifle is very clean and in excellent condition. The bore is nice and shiny. The butt stock has a few handling marks on it, but there are no cracks in it nor in the hand grip.

The chrome lined barrel is 16.2 inches with a long flash hider extending the barrel another 4 inches for an overall effective length of 20 inches. It has a right hand, 1:12 twist, four grooves rifling. I shot 40 rounds of Black Hills 168gr though it and got groups in the 1.5""-2"" range. Nicely adjustable iron sites make this a great shooting rifle!

Included in the sale is an Owner's Manual and three magazines (1 holds 5 rounds, 2 others hold 20 rounds).

Asking $875.00, or best REASONABLE offer. FTF with cash in Greenwood or Franklin only. I will need to see your Indiana Driver's License, but nothing will be recorded.
