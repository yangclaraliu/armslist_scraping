Bore is rough and dark, finish is very variable from nicely patina-ed to what looks like bare metal.  Breech locks positively and breech lock releases cleanly.  Right-hand hammer has been repaired with non-original screw and is loose/slack.  Both hammers lock back correctly and triggers seem to be fully functional.  Woodwork is generally good although here is a damaged 1"" section on the underside where the stock meets the action and there are use marks appropriate to a used shotgun of this nature.  I would suggest getting this checked out before shooting it  as I am not familiar enough with shotguns of this nature to call it either way.

All prices are FTF in North Raleigh, Wake Forest, Youngsville or Louisburg.  I am not able to meet FTF anywhere else without a good reason, sorry.

Not really looking for trades, but I will consider offers.

The rifling and all looks great the upper is still in top shape. I looked down the barrel with my borescope to make sure it was clean and no defects, it all looks fantastic.

Especially desirable model... and yes an expensive example of a P-11.

SS slide.  Only offered for a short period way back in the day.  Hard to find. I've not seen another one anywhere.

Won't get dinged up, scratched, rusted, or otherwise likely to show it's age under the harshest of carry conditions.  Looks pretty much the same as the day I acquired it new.

Original hard case, manual, spare SS factory mag.  Note that certain S&W Mod 59 Series mags are compatible.  Lots of accessories available from KT.

Sorted. Really Sorted... 99.9999%+ reliable.  Takes a lot of time between cleanings and a lot of pocket lint to slow it down; just enough to give one a heads up. Quick brushing, a little CLP and back to a full service provider.

Very accurate for short barrel if you do your job.  Which isn't simple being a DAO. On a sand bag it groups and hits POA with the best.

My carry gun for some time.  Won't find a more reliable auto.  Hundreds of rounds - one premature lock back very early on; fixed.  I *think* there was ONE failure to feed in there somewhere and it was the ammo or mag lips a tad off.

New non-SS ones go for $200 to $250, some $300.  Fact: New ones aren't sorted and as great as K-Ts are, initially they frequently need a bit of attention to some details QA missed.  Had other K-Ts and follow online forums so very familiar with issues and their unsurpassed service.  One that works...  it's like money in the bank, er... make that under the mattress.

That's why I'm asking $350.  Firm.

Not satisfied with it, return in same condition as it left and I'll refund the $350 purchase price only; not to include all other expenses.

Only getting rid of it because I don't get to the range enough to stay adequately proficient.  Hate to give it up.

Accept Cash or USPS MO only.

FTF, In-state preferred.

Will consider shipping to buyer's FFL dealer.  Buyer assumes cost of all shipping, handling, FFL transfers, and any other fees involved. Normal paperwork, etc for Person to Person transfers Instate; i.e. a Pistol Permit or CHP in NC."

Get a piece of history!!

For sale is a New Old Stock, Daisy Model 12 SoftAir gun, a replica of the Tec-9 handgun.

These were the first airsoft guns brought into the US and were made back in 1987-88 and only sold for 1 year until they were pulled from stores because of how much they resemble the real guns (kids where being held at gunpoint by police officers because of the realism of these replicas). Since this all airsoft guns now require permenant orange tips on the barrel ends or must be a non-gun color, to distinguish ""toys"" from real firearms.

These airsoft guns fire standard airsoft bb's HOWEVER the bb's are loaded into lifesize 9mm shells and are loaded into an actual magazine! You pump the gun, the bb shoots out and the shell ejects, just like a real gun.
This is a very high quality item, metal and plastic parts and originally sold for $70 back in the 80's!

The gun for sale is as mint as you are going to ever find one. This is New Old Stock, never removed from the box, still has the zip-tie holding the bolt forward, all the shells, targets, manual, sling, bb's, and everything it originally came with. 99% condition, the other 1% is light shelf wear on the box, which will happen to any item sitting on a store shelf.

Will ship for $10.

With a 24” stainless bull barrel, 1 in 10 twist, free floating handguard and a high ride receiver for easier mounting of optics, the LR-308 has gone toe to toe with bolt action rifles and delivered comparable accuracy, with higher magazine capacity and rate of fire.

THE P2000
The newest addition to the Heckler & Koch handgun line, the P2000 ""US"" incorporates features of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with the latest innovations of HK engineers. A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 US uses the trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" (Law Enforcement Modification) model.
This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The P2000 trigger pull has been reduced to 7.5 to 8.5 pounds of pressure, compared to 9.5 to 11.5 pounds found on many conventional double action pistols.
Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol. A set of simple-to-install modular grips allows the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter's hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right- and left-handed shooters alike.
New for HK is the addition of industry standard mounting rails to the P2000 US, allowing the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 US includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines."

Trades:
I have considered trades, but will no longer entertain trade offers for firearms made in other countries. I'm trying to keep all my firearms made in the U.S.A. (with the exception of my first pistol.) I am not a fan of polymer. If you offer polymer, it should be something very interesting and special.

I may consider a duplicate, but there has to be something special about the trade to get me interested. I am a shooter more than a collector.

I prefer an OD Green framed 40 cal, but will consider others. 

I will not pay new price for a used gun. I can buy a used one locally for 399 plus tax. That's $423. If you can sell for less than that let me know. 

I do not need nor care about the ""xd gear"", holster, box, mag carriers. 

Also would trade for it. If you are looking for something and have an XD SC, let me know. I can trade up or down. Trade cash or guns, or donkeys or horses, bass boats... You get the idea.

It was built from M16 parts when it was still legal to do that, it has an M16 barrel, bolt, fire control group, pistol grip and uses standard M16/AR15 magazines(4 included). it was built using full auto parts, the sear is now removed of course, and still has the 3 way switch that switches to full auto, thoug hit does not engage anything. These are very hard to find, especially the one with the folding stock. the fore end is wood that was factory painted black. this particular rifle has a strong, smooth action and fires great. the bore looks great as well as the bolt face, this has not been fired much. the grooves and lands of the rifling are strong and shiny. The rifle breaks down much like the M16/AR series of rifles. there are not any videos, that i could find, of this rifle on the internet, or instructions on how to field strip it, it is pretty simple and i will be more than happy to show anyone interested how to do everything on it. i will include a few pictures and have many detailed pictures if you want more. email me with questions and/or offers, serious inquiries only please, i dont want to show it off to a bunch of people just becasue theyve never seen one. keep in mind this is a very rare collectable firearm and ITS VALUE WILL ONLY GO UP. im in no hurry to get rid of it as i really like it, just the only rifle i have in 5.56 and i try to keep the different round types minimal. Face to face transaction with missouri resident only, valid ID, no criminials, you know the drill. thank you found two others for sale on the internet, $800 for one with a fixed stock, $1300 for the one with folding stock, and its got rust all over it, mine doesnt.

also wanted to add it has a 1/10 twist barrel is a pretty accurate with 55gr bullets.

Selling it all for $525. 

I need to sell this weapon badly. I'm a contractor who earns money by piece work, and due to lack of work haven't worked in coming on two weeks. I'm new at my job, and it's a new company. No one told me or expected there to be a slow season in the winter, and I'm a dumbass 21 year old so I don't have much saved. This and donating plasma are the only things that are going to keep me from going under until work gets steady again.

Please consider my offer. I've tried to price it very well. Share this with your friends if you yourself are not interested. I have never shipped a firearm before but will work it out if I need to.

Thanks for reading and considering.

 Dad is asking $550.00 for the Lions head and $450.00 for the Doves Head.

Was originally green and now it’s desert tan on the outside.  Very well built heavy duty trailer.  Comes with side rails and rear gate (easily removed).  This trailer has the option of tilting by removing two pins (bolts) in the front where it attaches to the frame, then you set the pair of parking brakes to lock the wheels, then just back your truck up and the whole bed tilts up.  Found that to be a nice feature when doing some major yard work back in the fall.  This can be pulled behind any full size pick up truck.  I don’ t know what it weighs, but it’s not as heavy as you would think.  I pull it behind a dodge 1500 4wd with a tired drivetrain and it does just fine.   

 Overall condition is pretty good.  It’s got some surface rust in the bed and the front wall is a little bent up, I guess is wasn’t soldier proof ?  The wooden/metal rails are in fine working order and should last a good long time.  The 24volt military wiring harness is still there, however the taillights are not.  It is very easy to mount a new set of L.E.D. trailer lights on this trailer, the kit runs about $50.00 from autozone.  Tires are load range D and are like new.
I don’t have a title to it, but I can give you a bill of sale.  I was told that there are certain restrictions about selling these overseas, so I will only sell locally.
Please don’t email me with stupid questions, in fact, don’t email me at all.   Just call, it’s a lot easier for me. REDACTED

Sorry for sounding like a jerk, but there are a ton of idiots our there.

Overall length:  149”  That’s from the Lunette ring to the last protruding lift ring

I want a 22/45 instead. I'm not selling the scope, and I will re-install the iron sights that came with it. In the picture, you can see that the gun has a Volquartsen trigger, but I've replaced that with the factory trigger.

The gun has been very reliable for me. I would estimate that it has 300-400 rounds through it. It has a couple of small scratches in the finish: you can see a couple at the back near the rear-sight dovetail and there is a small one on the barrel, near the muzzle. 

I bought the gun for 350, I'm selling it for 280 or best offer. I'd also be willing to trade it for a 22/45."

This one is pretty basic but I can make additions for small price increases.  The retention strap system I used is just a cord attached to the top of the holster, which wraps over the gun and under another piece of leather.  It can also be easily left off at your request.  I can add tooling but that will take the price up with the amount of time I need to invest.  I figured the price based on the size of the one in the picture, which fits my Grandpa's old Colt New Frontier .22 (scaled down model of the old .45).  A Ruger Vaquero or a full size Colt New Frontier would not cost much more, but a bigger gun like a long-barreled Super Blackhawk would take the price up about $10 or so depending on specifically what you want.

My Remington 511 is an early example of the rifle.
The marks (KH) indicated a Manufacture date of May 1939.
There is also a serial # on the underside of the barrel where it emerges from the stock. It is 2533.
The barrel is stamped ""Scoremaster""
The bluing is in good shape (no rust), and it does have a nice patina.
The stock is not cracked, but it has a few bumps from normal use over the years.
It is bolt action and is clip fed, and has a Walnut stock.
It functions flawlessly and it is very accurate with its 24"" barrel

I am putting a trade value of $225 and a cash price of $175 on the fine classic rifle.

Bushmaster now offers a .22 Rimfire ""dedicated"" Upper Receiver/Barrel Assembly that will fit all Bushmaster Lower Receivers -- as well as most all AR15 Type Lower Receivers from other manufacturers (as long as they are ""mil. spec."" in measurement). With an Upper specifically designed for .22 Rimfire, you can quickly switch out from your 5.56mm/.223 caliber Upper to hone your shooting skills with the economical .22 Long Rifle ammunition -- which is acceptable at most indoor ranges due to its lower power and penetration. In addition to offering the advantages of more frequent training with your AR15 type rifle, the Bushmaster .22LR Upper adds versatility to the weapon system, and is a joy to use for ""plinking"". The light weight and low recoil will be appreciated by women and younger shooters. 

The Bushmaster .22LR Upper Receiver/Barrel Assembly is a complete ""kit"" which includes all pieces necessary to quickly convert your rifle over to .22 Rimfire. The Upper Receiver is chambered for .22 Long Rifle only, and operates in a semi-automatic ""blowback"" mode. Other parts of the kit include a 10 Round Magazine; a Recoil Spring and Buffer; and a Buttstock Insert which acts as a guide for the Recoil Spring and replaces the standard AR Buffer and Action Spring inside the Receiver Extension. The highly accurate 16"" Barrel is rifled 1 turn in 16"" for the .22 LR cartridge, and is machined of Chrome Moly Barrel Steel. A ""blowback"" operating bolt is machined from lightweight aluminum for great durability, and all parts are easily disassembled for cleaning / maintenance. The iron sights of the .22LR Upper feature a dual rear flip aperture (adjustable for windage), and a square front ""post type"" sight adjustable for elevation.
