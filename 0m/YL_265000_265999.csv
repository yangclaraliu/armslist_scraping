You don't see these everyday!,"Pinellas Co., Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 0,"Listed On: Monday, January 9, 2012",Handguns,no type,45 ACP,no type,no type,"I picked this up in a trade and would rather have a more traditional Tommy gun, my loss could be your gain. These do not come up for sale very often, do not miss your chance!


Up for grabs is this beautiful and very rare Thompson A5 lightweight. 2000 of these were made and are very hard to come by, this one has a 3 digit serial number. This one was made by Auto Ordinance (no Kahr junk) in West Hurley New York in September of 1975. The pictures you see below is the gun I have for sale, note the forward hand grip: it is NOT an AOW as it has a total factory length of 27” and there is no way to affix a stock to this. It has perfect wood and nice bluing, although there are a few very minor safe rubs.  This one came with a 13” barrel, it also comes with (6) 32rd stick mags. I am looking for $1800 cash but will consider reasonable offers. 

I prefer face to face in the greater Tampa Bay area with valid FL ID however I will ship this to the lower 48 states (from my FFL to yours) for $40.00.

Thanks for looking and have a great day!"

The bluing shows wear on the magazine tube from years of being cycled and the barrel has tiny specks of rust on it. I have installed a polymer heatshield on it which gave it a little more ""tacti-cool"" look.
I believe this may of once  been an acutal police issued gun becuase it had an old looking flip over bracket and buttpad on it( see pics)
The barrel is 18.5 inches.  It has a 6 shot capacity. (5 in the tube and one in the chamber) . This gun was just recently disassembled and every single part internally was thoroghly cleaned, reassembled and oiled. It also has a jeweled bolt and shell lifter.

The Rifle Stock is a Black with grey web, Bell & Carlson Fully Adjustable Medalist Tactical Remington 700 BDL Short Action Rifle Stock  THis is a description from the site : (The ultimate aluminum bedded varmint / tactical stock for heavy barreled short action 700's.Perfect for the M700 PSS, Sendaro and Varmint - #6629 Weatherby Mk V Tactical .)
Next is a H-S Precision Pro-Series Steel DM Bottom Metal Trigger Guard Assembly - Remington 700 BDL Only W/10 round magazine. These sell for $280 all day long and most of the time from the places I have been to, they are on back order as with this stock.
And Final is the Bi Pod which is a Shooters Ridge 6-9"" swivel mount that sell for around $45. I think for the price whoever gets this is getting a steal. I decided against puting my Rem R5 .308 into the stock and the setup so I am just trying to recover some of the money I have spent into it. THe Stock when I bought it cost me $525 before the same company droped the price to $419 which is what they sell it for today. The magazine with trigger gaurd however has not moved from the $280 I paid for it and the BiPod was bought for $45 from a local firearms dealer In all I am offering the complete setup for $500 cash and I am firm on that. You need no bedding on the stock as it has aluminum pillers and is ready for you to drop in your barrel, bolt and trigger group."

laminated stock and a laminated forend. Manufactured in Romania, the
7.62x39 mm GP WASR-10 is imported as a single stack rifle that accepts
single column 10-round magazines. After arriving in the U.S., the rifles
are disassembled, the magazine wells machined out to accept double stack
magazines, and the requisite number of U.S. made parts are installed for
BATF compliance.

These mags are great at the range, the HK aluminum left overs are nice and light, but for function and reliability I swear by the banana style/aspect of the original CETME design for my 7.62 as they have proven to be the best. I bought a hundred of these lads years back and have 25 available for sale now. I have personally dissembled, cleaned out gunk, cosmoline, etc. from each mag by hand. I have checked springs, followers and the bottom-plate for wear, cracks or any other issues and won't sell any that are sub-par. I have tested function by loading the full 20 rounds and then unloaded them manually as well as used most of them at one time or another at the range, I've worn out a CETME, but never the mags!

The gun has Tru Glo night sights and a ghost 3.5# disconnector installed. I have owned the glock for about a year and a half and had no problems with it at all. When I first purchased the gun, it had some wear on the slide from holstering. Being the OCD guy I am, I sent the firearm off to rockyourglock.com and had the slide refinished and it looks brand new now. As silly as it sounds, I also had them laser engrave a skull inside a bio-hazard symbol on the top of the slide, which you can see in the pictures. I think it is kinda cool but your mileage may vary.

I also have a Lone Wolf 40-9 conversion barrel which is a drop in fit and will allow you to shoot 9mm from the gun using G17 magazines. I will also throw in a Galco leather thumb break belt holster in with the trade. This is a fine setup, I am just consolidating away from my .40 caliber weapons. As you can see in the pics, I also have the box for the gun as well as 3 G22 magazines and 3 G17 magazines. That means you can literally start shooting 9mm and .40S&W right away if you get this.

I am looking to trade for a Generation 3 Glock 17 or a fullsize M&P9. I may consider a Sig 9mm if someone has one to offer. I am not interested in any other trades at this time. If you just want to buy this setup, I will let it go for $475 for everything.

As far as round count goes, I can't tell you on the .40 caliber barrel because I am not the original owner but it shoots as accurate as any Glock 22 I have ever shot. The lone wolf 9mm barrel only has around 200 rounds through it.

I am located in Pittsburg but would be willing to meet somebody between the Kansas City, Topeka, or Wichita area. I know I have to be in Topeka in a couple of weeks so if you are interested, I could make that entire drive and save you some gas. Thanks!"

The Benelli Performance Shop SuperSport is the ultimate in speed for shooters looking for a fast trap shotgun, competition shotgun, or sporting clays shotgun. Fine-tuned to achieve outstanding handling characteristics and superior performance, it’s fast and easy to handle with extremely effective patterning. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models feature lengthened forcing cones for a polished taper between the chamber and barrel that ensures enhanced, consistent patterning and reduces felt recoil. The barrel on the 12-gauge is back-bored to .733 inches to reduce back-pressure. Every SuperSport is fitted with Briley’s EZ bolt release mechanism and an enlarged, ergonomic bolt-operating handle.

The trigger assemblies have been seer-honed for crisp pull and unexcelled performance. Completing the package is a 6-ounce weighted forend cap for greater balance and smoother swing. The Performance Shop SuperSport features Benelli’s proven ComforTech® recoil reduction system with gel recoil pads and comb inserts as well as AirTouch™ checkering on the stock and forend for a firm, slip-resistant grip. Benelli Crio® barrels combined with Briley’s color-coded Spectrum choke tubes yield denser, more uniform shot patterns.

$850 for gun without scope.
26"" heavy barrel precision rifle.
I traded way too much for this...
.308 CZ 550 Varmint action ($979) with sniper stock, same as CZ 750 Stock cost $400. 26"" bull barrel. 40 rounds down pipe, properly broken in.
I talked to Jason Morton of CZ USA in Kansas City about this gun.
This action has a 3 1/2 lb adjustable trigger. Push it forward 1/4"" and it is a .8 lb ""set"" trigger.
See it here:
http://www.cz-usa.com/products/view/cz-550-varmint/
He said to put the sniper stock on it the stock is $400, see it here:
http://www.cz-usa.com/products/view/cz-750-sniper/
As new.
Comes with CZ rings, 30 mm. One 10 round magazine.
Springfield Gen II Mil scope, 4-14X56.
Includes bipod and Choate style bipod rail. No sling. 
I'd sell for $850 without scope. $1400 with Gen II.
Bottom dollar. I'd sell scope for $550.

Made in America, the 3901 Standard is a true no-nonsense synthetic stock shotgun that you’ll feel comfortable throwing behind the seat of your pickup, but it is an old friend you can rely on when the shooting heats up—no matter what the weather conditions.
Featuring the softest-shooting gas system around, a high-strength steel alloy hammer-forged barrel and Mobilchoke versatility, the autoloading Standard is a model of rugged reliability, uncomplicated  adornment and American pride.

The gun is in perfect shape, no flaws, scratches, or problems. The recoil is very soft compared to other 12ga. So easy to shoot it feels like you can bust skeet with your eyes closed. Ive taken this gun to meat shoots at the VFW and I win at least a couple rounds every time (just changing out the stock choke)

The gun will come with a soft case with sling and 3 chokes."

I took this in for a trade a few years ago and just don't shoot it. I've fired a few hundred rounds but it sits far too much for me so I'd like to sell it to someone who'll get use from it.

I don't know much about it but it is marked CJA SFLD MICH for the import and has Tapco trigger parts, muzzle nut, and IW stock. The front sight is a little canted since whoever installed the folding bayonet didn't pay attention. I have been meaning to fix it but since I rarely shoot it, it's not been a priority.

What you see is what you get, no box or mag, just the sling, rifle, and bayonet.

Price - $850

Payment - Cash for FTF or USPS Money Order/Cashier's Check is shipped.

Buyer pays all shipping charges. I estimate shipping at $30 but wouldn't be able to say for sure without a zip code. Shipping is only where legal in the CONUS.

If you have any questions please ask.




NOTE - To the idiot here who sent me a message telling me these sell NEW now for $500, get a clue. A WASR isn't a Norinco, if you can't tell the difference too bad for you.

The pictured ring was weighed by our local Jeweler at 6 pennyweight, which should put it between 9 & 10 grams. According to my scale...10 grams as pictured, but lets say closer to 9 grams.

This is 14K gold as shown in the photo.....14K gold is approximately 60% pure and gold is almost $1800 an ounce today, so you do the math for just the gold value here, not counting the additional value of the jewelry.
