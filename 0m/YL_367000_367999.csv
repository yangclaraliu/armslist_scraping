It is in great condition and the original owner told me it has been sitting in his safe for the better part of 20+ years. It's a 4 digit serial number and has a Hogue grip. I put the upper from my RRA on it and it fits every bit as tight as the RRA lower (if not better). I hadn't planned on selling but I'm looking to start another project. There are some minor wear marks, but they are so slight they don't show up well on the photos. This PWA lower seems to have a darker black color than my new RRA, not sure if that was normal for the PWA receivers as I don't have much experience with them. Everything is tight and the magazines drop freely. 

Please email with any questions (or if the photos don't work on here). First ""I'll take it"" gets it. I will be fair and go with the first person to answer. 

Asking $750 obo + actual shipping to your ffl, or face to face in the Colorado Springs area.

I know it's worth at least $650 bucks so shoot me your offers if interested. I'm interested in .380's, 9mm's 40., 45., m4/ar15 style tactical rifles...

I'm hoping to trade the guitar for 1 gun preferably .40 or .45 caliber and cash on your end."

The XD Sub-Compact has the natural pointability of the XD. Combined with the compact size and shape of its polymer grip, makes it feel more like a natural extension of your body rather than an object in you hand. That's why most people find they shoot better with an XD. This Essentials Package Sub-Compact is in .40 S&W and comes with 1-9rd mag and 1-12rd mag only. No Mag pouch or holster is included. This allows you to pick a holster that's right for you without wasting money on the full kit.

Very tight fit. This was made when Wilson Combat was buying their slides from Kimber. I've had one offer for the slide alone but want to sell it as a whole. Finish is stainless and matte stainless. 20lpi (lines per inch) backstrap. Abi safety, dovetail front sight, adjustable backsight. Gun was knocked off bench while cleaning one day and backsight broke and I never got around to fixing the adjustable backsight but can be bought online for $60 which is why I dropped the price. Minor ding to bottom of backstrap, hardly noticeable with the naked eye. Budsgunshop offered 950 in it's current condition but I figured I'd try to sell it around here as I need the money soon.

The work was performed by their top gunsmith Dave Williams who has been featured in multiple 1911/pistol magazines.  All of the upgrades carry SA's lifetime warranty.

CL AD: http://boise.craigslist.org/cto/REDACTED.html (cars & trucks - by owner)
I have a clean 1977 Dodge Ramcharger automatic 4x4 (same as Plymouth Trailduster) newly painted ARMY HMMVW flat tan. It has a Big Block Mopar 440 out of a 1972 Dodge Charger muscle car with over 500 HP that has been rebuilt with some nice after market parts with only a couple thousand miles on rebuild; glass packs on the true dual exhaust for a low mean sounding truck. The transmission and transfer case were both rebuilt at the same time as the engine. The transmission is the highly sought after heavy duty TourgueFlight A-727 auto, considered by most to be the best automatic transmission in the world. The four wheel drive works awesome with full locker differential low gear on the transfer case. This is true 4x4 and when in 4-low-lock, ALL FOUR wheels turn like a tractor at the same time, hard to find a real 4x4 these days. The truck has factory A/C, but not hooked up. The brakes are discs in the front and drums in the rear and all are in excellent shape and stops the truck on a dime. The interior is simple with black carpet on the floor and two nice black cloth bucket seats (with nice middle console) and shoulder seat belts, no back seat. The tires are 32/10.5/16 Mud Terrain with 80% tread or better. There is a custom made removable sun roof big enough to stand out of (nicely done, does not leak when locked into place). The removable hard top comes off all the way to the windshield for the summer; also has a factory roll bar. It has a CLASS 4 hitch wired for many different trailer light setups. This is a reliable turn key tough truck; heater works and is ready to go hunting, camping, or whatever else. This truck is a blast to drive and will slow crawl up anything you point it at or go over 100mph+ on the freeway; it gets LOTS of attention and is currently my daily driver. 

Full disclosure: The only leaking is out of the power steering components and front differential. Neither are major issues, just leaks that can be fixed down the road or just monitored and fluids added as you go..
Serius inquiries only, no low ballers.  I plan on having a rear seat in soon, and also replacing the power steering pump.  I am linking a youtube video of the truck....it was from the original owner DO NOT CALL his number if you read the discription.  I have had the truck less than a year, not even 1000 miles have I put on it.  CALL ME REDACTED

The new Infidel 3310 is a single-edged blade variant of the the very popular double edged Benchmade Infidel 3300. It incorporates all of the features of its predecessor while providing a slightly more utilitarian blade. The 3310 series is ambidextrous, being easily operable by both right and left handed users. The Infidel line is double action, meaning the knife both fires and retracts with the slide release on the front of the handle. The ComboEdge blade is S30V steel and is double ground (not chisel ground). The handle is black anodized T6 aluminum and has a deep pocket carry clip. BK1 coating provides excellent corrosion protection, which exceeds the ASTM-117 spec for saltwater while possessing higher scratch resistance."

If I don't get a buyer right away, I may offer it on consignment at TOW (Track of the Wolf).  Made from Rifle Shoppe parts and hand crafted by a well known and famous builder this is a very fine example worthy of display.  The work is impeccable with all proof marks and cartouche marks.  Barrel is 54 inches and overall length is 70.5 inches.  It is .66 caliber/16 gauge and is a great shooter.  Firearm has been well cared for and bore is shiny and bright.  I have taken 2 turkeys and 1 deer with this firearm.  

I have other projects that I need some cash for and the firearm has seen little use in the last few years.  Parts including the barrel for this firearm are well over $1300 not to mention wait time for The Rifle Shoppe, barrel manufacture and a builder to assemble them can be well over a 24 months.   I am offering it for sale at $1900 cash which is a more than a fair price as these period correct firelocks fetch $2500 to $3000 when offered for sale.  

Some history: 
The Buccaneer muskets were the weapons that actually put ""Tulle"" in business. In the 1693 inventory they had enough locks on hand to build 4650 Buccaneers. St. Etienne made them prior to tulle and starting in 1683 French ships were required by law to have at least 12 on board and to be sold to the colonies they went to. Then, by 1714, many colonies required each household to have 1 buccaneer with powder, ball, sword or bayonet, and if they were slave-owners, they had to provide their slaves with one as well. This law was in effect until the 1740’s. Because of their barrel lengths and the slower burning powders at the time, they were said to have much greater range. There were still 660 in the Quebec inventories in 1752. Barrel lengths range from 46"" to 60"" with 52"" to 54"" being the most common lengths. The standard caliber was .69 minimum, and .73 being the maximum. Some were even ordered cut back so they could be used with a socket bayonet. They were made with brass or steel mounts depending on the climate they were going to. Most of the ones going to Louisiana and Mississippi territories were brass mounted. Lewis Leonard has found the records from some American expeditions in Georgia and the Carolinas where they purchased quantities of these weapons to take with them. There are also drawings from the 1600’s of Iroquois Indians carrying them. The Americans captured many of these and they were used up into the Revolutionary War. If you study the Hudson Valley Fowlers they take most of their styling from these guns. 
The ""buccaneer gun,"" called a ""fusil boucanier"" by the French at the time, existed from at least the mid-17th century, and quite possibly earlier, until the late 18th century, its heydey being the latter half of the 17th century through the first half of the 18th. Its origin is unconfirmed, although it may be Dutch. The gun was a long barreled, club-butted, heavy caliber flintlock hunting arm. Fusils are flintlocks, not matchlocks, and the French flintlock was a true flintlock, not a doglock, although there are buccaneer guns with doglocks still extent--the variety of barrel, lock, and furniture of buccaneer guns was apparently quite broad. (""Mousquet"" in French of the period referred to a matchlock, ""fusil"" to a flintlock.) The version described by Exquemelin and referring to the 1660s to 1670s, and by Labat, referring to late 17th and early 18th centuries, had a barrel of four and a half feet (converted to French pouces, roughly 57 inches or so, although there were buccaneer guns with barrels longer and shorter than this), and a caliber of 16 balls to the pound. French calibers of the period are not equivalent to English calibers. To allow for windage, a French caliber of 16 balls to the pound ranges from a bore diameter of .732 inches (caliber) to .777 inches, due to the wide manufacturing tolerances of the time. The ball itself averaged .68 inches. French buccaneer guns ranged from 21 to 12 balls per pound, and perhaps even a bit larger and smaller. In the late 17th century, buccaneer guns manufactured for the French Navy were standardized at 18 balls to the pound (.689 to .732 inches). Unfortunately, although the buccaneer gun was manufactured in large numbers, it was a weapon put to much hard use, and few remain today."

I have an FFL and sell guns part-time.  I had the 2 remaining .380's for sale at $425, but am now offering them for $399.  

These pistols are extremely popular and thus hard to find due to the German engineering which provides a smooth, easy to pull slide, incredible accuracy and minimal recoil.  These are great pistols for concealed carry, women, new shooters and home defense due to their simplicity and ease of use with an external safety.

These guns are brand new and never been sold to a consumer. 

Please let me know if you're interested.

It is in very good condition and only has some very minor holster wear on the slide near the muzzle. This pistol comes with two magazines. This firearm has not been modified in any way from it's original manufacture in Poland. Whomever had this weapon issued to them (Polish Army or Police Officer) obviously took good care of it and also didn't fire it much. This weapon has a chrome-lined barrel and shoots the 9mm Makarov (9x18) round. 

If you want more info. on this firearm, check out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-64_(pistol)

I am also including in this sale, two custom made holsters for this pistol. As you will find, the holster selection for this pistol is slim to none. One holster I had hand-made by a local holster craftsman here in central PA is a pancake holster in dark brown leather. With this holster, the pistol rides very close to the body and is virtually undetectable even under a simple T-shirt. The other holster was hand-made by Robert Mika (LAPD-retired) and is one of his famous pocket-holsters. This holster is fabulous and stays in your pocket when drawing the pistol.

Also included with the sale is 500 rounds of 9mm Makarov (9x18) ammo.

Before you ask... No, I won't break up the items. Without the pistol I have no need for the holsters or ammo. 

$395.00.  The only reason I am selling is because I originally intended this to be a gift for a family member, only to find out they really like the pistol however prefer a revolver. 

Bottom line... it's a great concealed carry pistol and it packs a hard punch!!! This is a FTF sale at a local FFL here in the York/Harrisburg area. Buyer pays all transfer fees.

These pistols are becoming harder and harder to find, especially in such good condition as this one!

I am in a situation where i need a new cell phone as mine doesnt work so well anymore and this is the gun i use the least. Im asking 225 for it and that price is rather firm.  The only real issue with the gun is that the slug barrel sight has fell out.  Its a dovetail sight and the set screw apparently came loose last time it was being shot.  It is warranteed, i called mossberg on monday and they said they were sending a new one, no questions really asked at all.  However, it isnt here yet, so im posting as is and i figure if you want it, you will be willing to call them and get it as well.  

I do have the slug barrel and the shot barrel and they are both included as well as the case.  Its just a simple plastic case, nothing fantastic.  While i would like cash, i would also consider trade for a phone if its either a Samsung Skyrocket, or an HTC Vivid in good working order of course.  REDACTED only if you are serious."

The rifles were last imported 26 years ago before the ban and production has since stopped. The limited few that are in the US are the only ones that you will be able to get so the value is sure to increase. It uses M4 magazines and is chambered for NATO 5.56 (223). I purchased this rifle unfired. I couldn't resist so it has been shot 10 times (10rds). It still has the original packing grease around the pins. It is stamped by Kimber. Will also consider trade and cash for a quality snub nose, hammerless .38 in good shape"

This gun has always been reliable and has fired any brand and type of ammo I've run through it.  Was my range gun and recently my EDC CCW but now I've upgraded to a 1911 and no longer need this neat little gun.

In very good to excellent condition.  There is some minor holster wear but not much.  The gun will come with two magazines and a Remora tuckable holster for CCW.

$400 is fair and firm - sure you can order these guns for $400 online but then you have to factor in shipping, FFL fee and tax... also add the cost of a Bersa brand magazine (about $50) and the holster ($40) and the price is quite the deal.

Trades welcome but dont bust my balls if your trade isnt worth my gun I wont even respond.

JUST FOR THE RECORD:The rifle, quad rail, optics, and butt stock cost me what im asking everything else is just a bonus. even if you can find it all in stock you will spend way more then im asking. But apparently ""i R dumb"" and don't know what i spent. Just because you can see a low price on Google shopping doesn't mean that's what your spending. Get over it you don't like it don't buy it.

Now to the brass tax, I wanted an S.A.S.S. but of course everyone was out of stock when I had the cash. So I did what any amateur gunsmith(that's an understatement I live to work on guns i just don't get paid enough to call it pro so your not getting some garbage someone threw together without a idea of what they are doing like some of the craptastic ars on here I have formal training in the army) AND I built one Worked out better for me because i was able to two-tone it and the sass' out there are all one tone


Heres what i did:
Magpul PRS
Magpul MIAD
Magpul trigger guard
Magpul front and rear MBUS2's
PRI Gas buster charging handle
 Leapers 3-12X44AO SWAT Compact Accushot Rifle Scope, EZ-TAP,  36 color Illuminated Mil-Dot Reticle, 1/4 MOA, 30mm Tube
Midwest Industries Drop in quad rail for 308
MAgpul AFG
Magpul RVG
Magpul XTM Rail Panels 2 tone to break up color
UTG bi-pod(not sure which one cant remember)
I also have a ""permanent"" compensater for it though its not currently on.
I honestly don't know what I don't have on here that's not magpul except: pmags they don't fit an ar10 unfortunately but i have  
1 armalite 10 round
1 armalite 20 round 
Hard case don't remember by who but it isn't no cheapo depot
I have all the original parts still for now will be posting them to ebay if i don't get alot of serious reply's.

SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY: You show me yours(ie cash or guns) and ill show you mine at my range only (2a shooting center if you haven't checked these guys out do it they rock) Ill supply the ammo for mine and you do the same

For the right deal I will even throw in my Ncstar shooters mat I got for it, But again don't low ball me if I don't get what I want ill keep it already got some more ideas for it. If your trade doesnt equal my gun be preperred to throw in more guns or cash.

 I am selling to purchase a gun for my wife. I prefer something with a rail so I can attach a laser. I will entertain trades and have $300 cash for the right deal. I am ready to sell or trade today.

The AR - 15 is a DPMS with a Stainless Steel 20 inch Bull Barrel with a 1 in 9 inch twist, Osprey 6-24x50mm rangefinder scope, Mako Sniper stock with adjustable cheek riser and mono-pod, Harris Bi-Pod, UTG Free Float Quad Rails, 2 30 round magazines.  This thing is on the money.  I do have a Trijicon Tactical Scope (5-20x50mm) but it was purchased last week for $1179.00.  I would be willing to put it in the deal but it would be for the purchase price of $1179.00, no tax.  With either scope this rifle is very accurate.  

The Glock 26, 9mm is an all around great pistol.  Great concealable weapon.  It has night sights and is a great shooter as well.

The Walther P-22 is a .22LR and is fun to shoot.  I have a Gem Tech silencer adapter that I purchased with the intent to put a silencer on it but never did.  Two Clips and the original hard case.  It has the 5"" target barrel and FYI if you like the shorter barrel it can added if you decide to purchase one and change it out at a later date.  This is a quality weapon and great if you are teaching the wife or kids how to shoot a handgun.

Trade:  I am interested in getting a 50 cal. to add to my collection. Or an AR-10, .308 cal. Just let me know what you have.  We can discuss price.  Thanks.  Call Mike at REDACTED[img]hotmail.com[/img]"

If you're going to low-ball me because this is a Century gun, so be it - but don't expect a reply. This a very reliable, accurate, well-made weapon - the welds aren't pretty and it could use a re-finish, but it'll run Wolf, Brown Bear, Tula... anything you throw at it, both cheap or expensive. It's a shooter, pure and simple - a fantastic rifle."

I will also throw in an old Bushnell Sportview 3x9 (though you will need to get scope rings for it) 

The Marlin 39 is the cream of the crop of lever 22's, often imitated, and never duplicated (sorry Henry rifles). The value on these keeps going up and up and up. Plus, it really is the best lever action 22 ever made. I will probably regret this, but I am itching so bad for a 1911 I think I have to trade her away.

2. Remington R1 Enhanced

This is a VERY nice M1 with serial number that date it to fall of 42.  Imagine where this may have been.  The barrel date matches up with the receiver, so likely it is original barrel to receiver.  UN-cut op rod.  Beautiful wood, nice walnut stock with good color and no excessive dings or scratches.  The metal is smooth and in very good condition.  This is not your typical gun show bruiser or CMP rack grade gun.  Those are good guns to, this one is better though :)  No import marks. Parts are somewhat of a mixed bag, Bolt is HRA, seems to be some Winchester in there somewhere also.  I dont have a gauge but I believe the muzzle wear is quite minimal based off the ""bullet test""  Have not tested the throat.  Bore is about a 8.5 out of 10 probably.  I can take more pics for those who have a serious interest.  Will do FTF or ship to your FFL. for cost of shipping and insurance through USPS.  Cash on FTF or USPS money order if shipping to your dealer.  The only thing that would probably make this a better rifle is if the parts were all matching.  $1300. Thanks for looking."

Looking for a light and reliable home defense shotgun that is able to fit both men and women?  The Remington 870 is a proven defensive weapon and in 20 ga it is lighter and has less recoil than the 12 ga model.  ""Delivering roughly the ballistic force of two .44 Magnum rounds at once,"" comments the knowledgeable Ayoob, the 20 ""delivers 75% of the lead for only 50-60% of the recoil"". Many police departments have found their officers shoot much more accurately in realistic training exercises with the lighter-kicking but still potent 20 gauge.

If you are new to shotgunning and considering getting one for self-defense.  You'll be much happier with the lighter-kicking 20 gauge than the 12 gauge version used by the military, and - most importantly - you'll shoot the 20 more accurately and rapidly.
