The Government paid close to $8000 a copy.

This rifle started life as a CAR15, known as the Colt Accurized Rifle, it is an uncommon variant of the popular AR15.  A Government Agency came to me and asked me to develop a specific weapon which could accomplish a specific mission for long distance absolute accuracy, they wanted to use .223.  I did not ask why, because there are better choices, but nevertheless, this is the prototype.  50 of these were built, and are in service.  This is a one of a kind.  The rifle with a qualified shooter and 77 grain match ammo can and will put them in the same hole out to 300 meters, and within a 1-2 inch group out to 500 meters, with the maximum design range of 700 meters. It is capable to 1000 meters, but has not been tested at that range as that was outside the design parameters of the order.  Note, this is not a manufactured rifle, it is an enhanced original product, so no stamps are required. 

NONE OF THESE ARE IN CIVILIAN HANDS THAT I KNOW OF.  YOU WILL HAVE THE ONLY ONE OUTSIDE OF GOVT OR LE AND ITS PERFECTLY LEGAL TO OWN IT.

The rifle was completely disassembled.  Added was a 23.5"" stainless barrel with M4 feed ramps, and threaded for a suppressor and provided with a thread protector.  Barrel is 1:7 twist and is free floated with a solid hand guard, flush gas block.  BCG was printed, and lightened for faster dwell time, bolt was trued.  Trigger was replaced with a skeletonized Timney which was hand polished and set to a crisp 3 pound pull with crisp break and no creep.  Butt stock is the PRS dual adjustable as to cheek piece and length of pull and is equipped with an Accu-pod.  Weapon will arrive with 2 ea, 20 round magazines.  The lower receiver is equipped with a mag carrier for a second loaded mag. 
Scope is a Carl Zeiss 6.5 - 22 X 50 BDC scope for the 77 grain projectile with ranging reticle.  There is an anti cant level on the scope, butler creek flip up optic covers.  Triple screw tactical rings on the Colt base. 

Rifle will be delivered with a custom scope and muzzle cover, a custom fitted blackhawk case, and 50 rounds of match ammunition, 2 ea. 20 round magazines. A Harris tactical bipod with cant lock.   All original and replaced parts will be provided to the buyer and all documentation.  This is the most accurate semi-automatic sniper system (SASS) rifle you will ever handle.  We tested 12 different barrels before deciding on the one installed. Nothing is more perfect. 

This is heavy, and bulky, shipping and packing  CONUS $100.00.

These stock sets are not easy to find and are not cheap! Why spend $1500 on a Romanian Wasr when you can own a Polytech for around the same price. Polytech AK's are top of the line and feature the thicker 1.6mm receiver. These AK's are known for their reliability and their quality.

So, I'm assuming it pretty much wasn't fired much if any.

Included is a nylon holster, five mags (2 Original; 3 ProMag), extra sights, and 200 rounds of boxed Hornady Ammo (valued close to $280), an Allen padded case, and the original plastic carrying case.

Ammo is brand new in boxes of 50 and there are 20 boxes per brick. Hate to get rid of this stuff but times are hard.. Wanting to get what I paid back.

Price is 375 per 1000 .40s 
 425 per 1000 .45s 

Online 1000 bricks of non fired .40 cal is going for 425-455
.45s are at 550 or so and they are only going to go up I fear.

I really don't want to break up a brick, if I have to, price per box is 20 a box for .40s and 23 for .45s

Face to face and cash only. May entertain trades for a cool handgun, revolver, eotech, ar ammo etc. please no crazy trades. We all know ammo is near impossible to find these days"

This is a recoil reducing stock for a Mossberg 500. It works very well, but I prefer the traditional stock. This is an Enidine recoil reducing shotstock. This reduces the recoil about 70% to make all day shooting more comfortable. It works better than the Knoxx Stock, and looks better in my opinion. If you are in the ""zombie"" fad, this is a good stock for your Mossberg. Or you can make your shotgun look real tactical. Comes with a mil-spec VLTOR stock, and a FAB industries pistol grip. This will all go as one package, so I will not separate. This should also fit the Mossberg 590, but I have to way to find out for sure. You can always use this for a Remington 870 as well, but you will have to choose a different pistol grip adapter.

I am not in dire need of cash, and my GF wants me to keep this, so no lowballers. I spent about $300 to get this, so send me reasonable offers. No scams, etc... Local only, no shipping. Cash or trade only.

Supposedly Enidine is discontinuing the Shotstock. If this is true, then this is one of the last chances to get one!"

This is not a 30/30 though it looks like one. Serial # starts with 26 and Marlin's DOM chart places that at 1974. That means this is a pre safety rifle. The steel is in great shape but the stock has a couple of dents in the wood. That's probably because this is a great rifle and was actually used. I'm listing it for $400 but will listen to any serious offers. If you low ball me I won't bother to return your message. Text me at REDACTED.
