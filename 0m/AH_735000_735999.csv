Call or Text me at REDACTED.

Benjamin Marauder is one of the most anticipated rifles. In May the first small batch (100 rifles) were sold in one hour. It became a real sensation and was much discussed.
   Designing this rifle Crossman (Benjamin and Sheridan are trade names owned by the Crosman Corporation) set goal to make a NUMBER ONE PCP with all the features of a quality rifle but at the same time they wanted this gun to be affordable. Not cheap but affordable.
 The Marauder is a 10-shot repeating preCharged Rifle ( .177 or .22 ). This gun has an ambidextrous stock of traditional design with a raised cheekpiece. It has no sights.

The trigger of Benjamin Marauder is fully adjustable. The rifle has a built-in monometer and adjustable fill pressure. It may be charged by compressed air or CO2. The working pressure is 3000 psi when compressed air is used and 2000 psi when using CO2.
This Air rifle has a unique system of adjustable velocity. So you can choose the best pellets and the best velocity for these pellets in order to shoot extremely accurate.
Choked barrel also contributes better accuracy. The barrel is shrouded. It makes Benjamin Marauder incredibly quiet. So quiet, that 50 feet away it’s impossible to hear anything.

This Rifle really has one of the prettiest stocks I've ever seen on a SKS, which is why I removed the old varnish(non-harmfully with no sandpaper) and added a tung oil finish that approximates the original shellac without over darkening or clouding the features of the figured birch and which won't flake off. Has flat blade bayonet and cleaning rod, I could probably rustle together a buttstock cleaning kit if the buyer wants.


I am including a Chicom sling, a refinished with bake on paint and textured 35Rd detachable magazine(with which I have never had problems and did scratch slightly while the paint was curing), 5 10Rd clips(not sure of Mfg. if I find more I'll add them to the lot), a clip pouch(again, not sure of Mfg.), and if you come to Tahlequah to pick it up I'll throw in about 130Rds of Wolf plinking ammo some of which is discolored from humidity exposure and 25Rds of some 'lacquer' coated stuff I can't remember the name of.

I'm selling it because I never really take it out and shoot it anymore since I converted my Saiga and I could use a little extra scratch for gifts and such.

I am asking $600 for it, but will consider trades or partial trades(would gladly accept $350+Tokarev/Makarov/CZ-82/CZ-52), don't be afraid to send me offers or ask questions and if you want any pictures of specific parts just ask and I will take them A.S.A.P.

asking 300.00 or will trade for 308 ammo plus cash

made in 1968 it is in great shape. i took it to the range and it is very accurate.

it is numbers matching and the wood is dark mahogany, i thought about refinishing

the wood, but i just could not remove the patina and its history off of it.

i also have a 1907 pattern bayonet that i would sell with it. the bayonet fits the rifle
 but is an earlier enfield bayonet i would take 80.00 for it

both rifle and bayonet would be 380.00

It's a sweet rifle and it's brand spanking new. Is it worth what I'm asking in a normal market? Nope. Is it worth MORE than I'm asking if we get a ban on new ARs? Yup. So if you don't think there will be any new gun laws targeting ARs, you should pass this up. If you think there will be a ban on new ARs, you should buy this and you'll have the option of keeping it or selling it for a profit.

All laws apply. Folks with a concealed handgun permit get preference.

Not interested in any trades. Not selling the lower or upper separately. Not parting out the BCG."

Only selling because I have a Match M1 and I prefer the less ""evil"" rifle in my safe. It would have run about $1700-$1800 before taxes before last friday!....now you can't even find an AR in a store.  This isn't your run-of-the-mill sporter that sells for $650-$750.  This isn't a close quarters combat carbine either....it weighs roughly 11 lbs.  It is set up for Service Rifle matches.  I prefer to use my vintage rifles and looking to raise some cash to purchase another M1, M1 carbines interest me also for fun shooters.  I could be slightly swayed with cash and a decent CCW pistol, but need some decent cash out of my rifle.

Brand new, complete Colt M4 upper assembly with M4 tall handguards. Complete with Colt FA bolt carrier and FN Bolt. 1/7 twist, chrome bore and chamber, 14.5"" barrel. Also included is a brand new Matech rear sight assembly, just like our troops use. Adjustabe for both windage and elevation.
M4 feed ramps and m4 marked above the gas tube. 

No trades at this time. Thinning out my collection. Price is firm 

It's the standard barrel that is exactly the type they issue or troops. 

NFA regulations require an extended flash hider be installed (pinned and welded) to bring overall barrel length to over 16"". So please be aware of this. The second option is to use as a pistol upper, just don't put any kind of foregrip on it. Third option is to register a Short Barreled rifle with the ATF. This is not something you can just stick on your ar15 lower and be legal.

The second barrel is a storm lake 6 3/4"" threaded barrel which is bushing style with a fitted ed brown bushing.  I have a 3 port gans guns stainless compensator installed.  There are two recoil spring plugs, one for the bushing and one for the bull barrel.  With a 14 lb spring it will handle super (28k psi) and rowland level (40k psi) loads.  With the longer barrel rowland ballistics can be reached by 30k psi which is easier on the gun and brass.  Both barrels have been throated with a mansion reamer for wfn cast bullets.  I've successfully shot up to 275 grain bullets through both barrels.  The storm lake barrel has deeper grooves than the factory and handles high velocity cast loads better.

Now, I know at the price I'm asking this seems like another panic sell. But let me assure you that you are getting a great value. First, this is a complete all-steel lower. It has a Rock River Arms two-stage trigger group AND a Spikes-Tactical buffer. It currently has a matte-black stock and pistol grip on it, but I'm including my steel-colored stock and pistol grip as well. Has a few minor wear-and-tear marks, like on the hammer and buffer tube but that's to be expected. Your looking at a $200 lower, $120 trigger group, $40 buffer, and $80 in stocks/pistol grips. Add in shipping and handling plus the FFL and this becomes $520 worth of lower in a heart-beat. I'm only asking $450 to buy some late Christmas presents (sister and mother ARE coming to town, didn't expect it).

Right now, you'll pay over $300 for a stripped lower: ( http://www.midwestguntrader.com/viewad.asp?id=REDACTED2110119 ).  
And $400 for, of all things, a polymer lower: ( http://www.armslist.com/posts/735073/springfield-missouri-gun-parts-for-sale-trade--virgin-ar-15-complete-lower )! 
And a whopping $500 for a stripped lower and a parts kit, no stock, buffer, or buffer tube ( http://www.armslist.com/posts/735396/springfield-missouri-rifles-for-sale--saa-stripped-ar-15-lower-and-cmmg-parts-kit-new- )! 

This lower has a high-quality receiver, high-quality trigger, high-quality buffer, and two stock sets!

$450. Must meet face-to-face, Kansas residents must pay FFL (I'll meet you at a shop of your choosing). Must have bill-of-sale. If you can't own it, don't try it."

from Valhalla is steep, and Valkyrie craftsmanship top-notch. This

Interested in possible trade or trade plus cash, or straight up cash if the offer is right.  Looking to trade for a high end AK, high end AR, plus cash...or two rifles....who knows.

As the title says I have a Keltec KSG.  I have added the keltec foregrip (from their site).  I have shot maybe 20-25 shells through it.  It is in basically new condition.  Might have a small mark on one of the feed tubes.

Will come with original box and everything that came with the gun.  I will more than likely toss in 60 mini shells for it.  These are 1.75"" shells.  The shotgun will hold (I believe) 23 of these.  11 in each tube, 1 in the chamber.

Please email me your offers and I will try to respond to all.  If you are offering a trade please send photos of what you are offering.  If I am interested in the offer, I will gladly send high resolution photos of the shotgun.  All local and state laws will be followed.  FOID is a must if you are a resident of Illinois.  If out of state, we will use an FFL at the buyers expense.

Will these be banned?  I don't know, possible I guess.  Who knows what the powers that be think of bullpup shotguns that hold 15-23 rounds.  Are they already virtually impossible to get your hands on, yes."
