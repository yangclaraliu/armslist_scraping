Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier.
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier.
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier.
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier.
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier.
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Gun have a grip safey, clip safety and slide safety and locks slide as shown in pic. Gun does come with 1 clip but has a feeding issues with the clip. The clip basically needs to be replaced(Found replacement clips online for $35),  it will feed 1 bullet fine but dont work to well with more than 1 bullet in the clip and is obvious someone has done some bending or modifying to the top of the clip, That's reason I say clip is the issue, due to have being bent and attempted repair, that's why it don't feed the bullets right because the clip basically needs to be replaced, than gun should work flawlessly.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

after you've done that simply enter in you're information at the bottom and make sure everything is filled out. after double checking that all information has been correctly filled out click ""send message"" at the bottom of the screen. this will send you're letter to the offices of president obama and ALL of you're state representitives urging them to oppose any and all gun control legislation.
please don't wait to do this if you don't stand up now we all fall. even if you're not a gun owner you should oppose any legislation that removes any civil rights of american citizens. this time it may be gun rights but next time it could be you're right to speak freely or you're right to worship the religion of you're choice or you're right to??? civil rights are ALL sacred and if you 
oppose removing the rights of the people please go to the link provided and stand up for america......NOW!!! words cannot describe how important this is."

...............................................................................................
Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

................................................................................................

after you've done that simply enter in you're information at the bottom and make sure everything is filled out. after double checking that all information has been correctly filled out click ""send message"" at the bottom of the screen. this will send you're letter to the offices of president obama and ALL of you're state representitives urging them to oppose any and all gun control legislation.
please don't wait to do this if you don't stand up now we all fall. even if you're not a gun owner you should oppose any legislation that removes any civil rights of american citizens. this time it may be gun rights but next time it could be you're right to speak freely or you're right to worship the religion of you're choice or you're right to??? civil rights are ALL sacred and if you

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

................................................................................................

after you've done that simply enter in you're information at the bottom and make sure everything is filled out. after double checking that all information has been correctly filled out click ""send message"" at the bottom of the screen. this will send you're letter to the offices of president obama and ALL of you're state representitives urging them to oppose any and all gun control legislation.
please don't wait to do this if you don't stand up now we all fall. even if you're not a gun owner you should oppose any legislation that removes any civil rights of american citizens. this time it may be gun rights but next time it could be you're right to speak freely or you're right to worship the religion of you're choice or you're right to??? civil rights are ALL sacred and if you 
oppose removing the rights of the people please go to the link provided and stand up for america......NOW!!! words cannot describe how important this is."

We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

................................................................................................

after you've done that simply enter in you're information at the bottom and make sure everything is filled out. after double checking that all information has been correctly filled out click ""send message"" at the bottom of the screen. this will send you're letter to the offices of president obama and ALL of you're state representitives urging them to oppose any and all gun control legislation.
please don't wait to do this if you don't stand up now we all fall. even if you're not a gun owner you should oppose any legislation that removes any civil rights of american citizens. this time it may be gun rights but next time it could be you're right to speak freely or you're right to worship the religion of you're choice or you're right to??? civil rights are ALL sacred and if you

Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

...............................................................................................
Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

................................................................................................

after you've done that simply enter in you're information at the bottom and make sure everything is filled out. after double checking that all information has been correctly filled out click ""send message"" at the bottom of the screen. this will send you're letter to the offices of president obama and ALL of you're state representitives urging them to oppose any and all gun control legislation.
please don't wait to do this if you don't stand up now we all fall. even if you're not a gun owner you should oppose any legislation that removes any civil rights of american citizens. this time it may be gun rights but next time it could be you're right to speak freely or you're right to worship the religion of you're choice or you're right to??? civil rights are ALL sacred and if you 
oppose removing the rights of the people please go to the link provided and stand up for america......NOW!!! words cannot describe how important this is."

First and foremost I am NOT looking to capitalize on the upswing in the market, I have receipts for $799.99 plus $35 shipping plus $20 FFL transfer I am in this thing for over $850. I myself have flagged my firearms on this site for being outrageous, I am only looking to recoup my investment and get something different.  I encourage you to check J&G sales website the current price is $899.99 (plus shipping FFL transfer it will be right at $1,000. Again you will see I am not gauging or inflating my price. 

I purchased this from J & G sales the current price is $899.  I encourage you to check it out. Please note I have not doubled the price of this item like others are doing right now. This ""assault style"" rifle with its 30 round magazines will certainly be on the bye bye list, we all know that. 

The VZ 58 platform is what many consider to be an improved version of the AK, it has a fully milled receiver, bolt hold open, larger ejection port, aluminum 30 round magazines (I am including 2) and an overall improved fit and finish, resulting in improved ergonomics, reduced weight and superior accuracy.  I suggest you check out youtube and read about these VZ 58s if you aren't familiar with them and these are revealed as some of Century Arms best builds.  This gun has never been fired or loaded. I disassembled, fully cleaned and lubricated the gun and put it in my climate controlled safe.  

What you see is what you get, the VZ2008, 2 30rnd mags one is black and one is grey and original paperwork.  All numbers are matching, and this firearm as stated is in new condition with zero defects or blemishes. The synthetic furniture is all matching and in good shape.  If 

I have a few items I will consider as trades: smith governor, M1 carbine, AR 15, AK47 (other than wasr), 223 ammo, K98, Kimber 1911. While this is not an exhaustive list, please understand I am a ""fine"" gun collector and I do not deal in junk or rusty firearms.  I am not willing to travel greater than 45 minutes.  I am a reasonable guy and all trades up or down will be based upon fair values of items.  Lt me know what ya have worst I can say is no.  

I will consider shipping this from my ffl to your ffl, but there will be shipping, packaging and my ffl dealers fees added to final cost."

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

...............................................................................................
Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

................................................................................................

after you've done that simply enter in you're information at the bottom and make sure everything is filled out. after double checking that all information has been correctly filled out click ""send message"" at the bottom of the screen. this will send you're letter to the offices of president obama and ALL of you're state representitives urging them to oppose any and all gun control legislation.
please don't wait to do this if you don't stand up now we all fall. even if you're not a gun owner you should oppose any legislation that removes any civil rights of american citizens. this time it may be gun rights but next time it could be you're right to speak freely or you're right to worship the religion of you're choice or you're right to??? civil rights are ALL sacred and if you 
oppose removing the rights of the people please go to the link provided and stand up for america......NOW!!! words cannot describe how important this is."

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. 
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

The chamber look great, rifling is great, I have no doubts this is still a great shooter grade Mauser. The action is very smooth and tight on this rifle. The reason for sale is I am more of a historical collector than a shooter and really want an original K98 Mauser.

Info . . . 

Product Information
Shop more Glock products This is a factory original, drop-free magazine for your Glock. Glock magazines have a hardened steel insert encased in high tech polymer. This polymer coating protects the magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from a great height.

Technical Informaion:

Glock magazines have very stiff springs when new and may be extremely difficult to load to full capacity. It may be necessary to use a Glock magazine loader (generally included in the Glock case with the handgun) to load the magazine to capacity or near capacity.

If the last round appears impossible to load, for example if the magazine should hold 13 rounds and it will only accept 12, leave it loaded with 12 rounds for several days to allow the spring's tension to decrease. After a short time, the magazine should then accept its full capacity, but it may still be necessary to use the magazine loader. After several cycles of full capacity through empty, the magazine will be easier to load."

I'm in no real rush to liquidate this rifle so I'll definitely consider offers as they come. The rifle will ship via UPS to a local FFL of your choice, shipping is included in the price. If you're in my state, a face-to-face might be possible, but we'd have to work out the feasibility and the terms.

The base rifle (16"" barrel 7.62x39mm Saiga rifle) was purchased new in January 2012 and the conversion was completed that May. Rifle has around 500 rounds through it, so there's a bit of wear and tear on the operating parts but nothing out of the ordinary. If you want interior detail shots or alternate angles, feel free to ask.

I'll give the rifle a good through cleaning before shipment so it'll be all sparkly and whatnot when you receive it. The aftermarket parts are as follows:

-US-made KVAR polymer stock w/ cleaning kit trapdoor (stock Saiga cleaning kit naturally included)
-Ergo pistol grip
-Tapco G2 fire control group
-Bullet guide installed to allow feeding from traditional AK magazines
-Uninssued Bulgarian polymer handguard (US-made heat shield) mounted using US-made handguard retainer
-UltimAK railed gas tube for scout-style scopes and electronic sights
-Primary Arms Micro red dot (mounted on the UltimAK rail as pictured)

The five magazines are four Romanian 30rd mil-surp steel magazines in fair to good condition (just got them a few weeks ago and cleaned them up) as well as the stock Saiga 10rd magazine. While proprietary 30rd Saiga magazines (like those made by SGM/Surefire) have spotty reliability now that a bullet guide has been installed, the 10rd mag still feeds great and is useful for benchrest shooting.

In addition to everything listed above, the rifle also comes with a NcStar soft case with five mag pouches (I know, very fancy), a bare-bones Blackhawk! two-point sling, a UTG front sight tool, and the stock Saiga cleaning rod. I've also got 155 rounds of TulAmmo 7.62x39mm FMJ that I'll include as a freebie. Since the ammo has to ship separately (as per UPS guidelines regarding the shipment of firearms and ammunition), I'll load those rounds into the five magazines and some stripper clips and ship those straight to your door as opposed to shipping the empty magazines with the rifle parcel.

Private message me offers and questions, I'll do my best to respond."

Customer after customer have continued to tell us how much they love the ability to adjust their TI25 mags to exactly fit their gun as well as the ability to take the mag apart to clean it. Quality costs money, but the features that are only found in this mag have already made our MACHINED ALUMINUM TI25 MAGS famous!  Read on and you'll see why TI25 mags are an easy choice for serious shooters!
  1. MACHINED AIRCRAFT ALUMINUM CONSTRUCTION FROM SOLID ALUMINUM BARS

	Our TI25 Machined Aluminum Magazine is the toughest, most durable Ruger 10/22 magazine on the market without exception. The 2 body halves are MACHINED one at a time out of solid T6 aircraft aluminum bar with the same precision and tolerances as space and defense and aircraft parts. We start off with 3 POUNDS OF SOLID AIRCRAFT ALUMINUM BAR and high speed CNC machine for over an hour to wind up with a complete mag body that now weighs only a little more than 8 ounces! Each part has to pass our exacting quality control examination to ensure its precise dimensions. The result is you wind up with an aircraft quality part that some would consider an ""over kill"" for a 10/22, while others of us consider it exactly what we've been looking for... Our TI25 Machined Aluminum magazines are designed to stand up to hard use. Don't settle for less!
  2. COMPLETELY DISASSEMBLE TO CLEAN OR SERVICE

	Anyone that's shot .22 rimfire ammo knows how dirty it is, and a lot of the crud gets into the inside of the magazine which continues to make the mag less reliable. Now with our TI25 mag, that problem no longer exists. Three stainless steel cap screws make it easy to disassemble the mag into two separate halves for cleaning using the supplied allen wrench. Scrub the INSIDE with some hot soapy water, dry and reassemble and its as clean as it when it was new. Yep, it costs us more to make a mag that you can disassemble rather then just gluing it permanently together, but being able to disassemble it is the right way to make a mag!
  3. PRECISION ADJUSTABLE TO EXACTLY FIT YOUR GUN

	Have you ever wondered (and cursed) about the amount of wiggle in all other 10/22 high capacity mags? A magazine should not wiggle that much in your gun, but it has to to fit... WELL NOT ANY MORE! It has been our experience that Ruger 10/22 rifles have some minor variations from one to the next which explains why one brand mag will run well in one gun and the same mag then not run in a different gun. What separates this mag from all others is the patent pending ability to micro adjust it for an exact fit in your gun for (1)FEED ANGLE, (2) FEED HEIGHT and (3) EJECTOR TO BOLT DISTANCE using the supplied 3/32"" allen wrench. Four cap screws on the top of the mag that mate with your 10/22 receiver allow the mag to quickly be precision adjusted for an exact fit in your gun by minimally increasing or decreasing the individual heights of each of the cap screws (like leveling an appliance), resulting in a magazine that has minimal to no wiggle in your gun AND THAT WORKS!. The ability to quickly one time precision adjust it to your gun means that you can count on reliable feeding every time."

I'm not particularly sure what the issue is but it could be a battery connection problem or it could need to be refurbished by eotech. From what I have been told, if the sight is in warranty, it will be replaced or repaired for free. If it's not, it will cost you $58 to have it completely refurbished. Nonetheless, it still works fine in lower levels of light. Also included is a Vector Optics green laser. This is a very high quality laser and is extremely bright. The laser alone cost me a pretty penny. Also included will be one, 50 round magazine. I will consider partial trades for steel AK magazines, 7.62x39, and perhaps a few other things that I need.

Specs and info:

One of our ALL TIME BEST Carbine models, the M4 Type features a distinctive Military Barrel Profile and Six Position Telestock – great for 3 Gun Match Shooting, Home Defense and Law Enforcement use.

The Bushmaster A2 & A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are modeled after our M4 Type Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individual officers (semi-automatic configuration with 16"" barrel).

The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon.

Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release.

I bought this new a long time ago, threw some upgrades on it and never fired it. The gun is UNFIRED and still has factory grease on it. The gun will come with the ORIGINAL handguards, it will NOT come with the rail or MagPul AFG (I need those for something else.). The rifle will look just like the first picture with nothing on it. The second picture is to show you what it looks like when you throw on some mods. This is the Polymer AR-15 offering from Bushmaster. It's very light and I think that makes it ideal for hunting. I haven't fired it, so I cannot tell you how well it performs but while charging it and everything, it works and functions like any other AR-15 without the weight. I will accept multi-trades (firearms) of equal value. I could also accept firearms and cash. I will not accept under $1200 because that's what even the ""mutt"" AR-15s are bringing in. If you want a nice AR-15 before the ban, you may want to jump on this. Located in Fayetteville."

-Model 94- 30-30 Win.-

Also, this gun is fully functional.  It feeds rounds, goes bang, ejects rounds, and feeds the next one to continue its intended process.  The action and buttstock are from 1915, but the barrel is from somewhere between 1950 & 60.  What this means is that the rifle will have no trouble with copper jacketed ammunition.
