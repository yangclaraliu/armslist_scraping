LaserLyte CK-SWAT Side Mount Laser for S&W J-Frame and Taurus Revolvers finally gives your revolver a reliable laser sight that can be used with the factory gun grip. These laser sights are incredibly easy to install underneath your handgun's grip: simply choose the correct base plate, remove the gun grip, screw the sight into place, and replace the grip. Within a few minutes, you'll have a sighted, highly accurate Laser-Lyte laser sight for your revolver. The Laser-Lyte J-Frame Side Mount Laser Sight doesn't affect the profile of your revolver, so you can place it in a holster with ease: the only revolver-mounted laser sight to do so with factory grips. These sights have a nighttime range of 500 yards, plenty of power for your handgun. Laser Lyte has made the Side Mount Laser compatible with all Smith & Wesson J-Frame and Taurus revolvers, including the Public Defender. What's more, an auto-off feature automatically turns the sight off after 6 minutes to preserve the 5 hour battery life. Add precision accuracy to your Smith & Wesson J-Frame or Taurus revolvers with the Laser Lyte S&W/Taurus Revolver Side Mount Laser Sight.

Up to 100 rounds of Alexander Arms .50 caliber ammunition also available for purchase ($3.50/round). Refer to Alexander Arms website for further info. Please refer to New Frontier website for info on the lower. No California Sales. .50 Beowulf® Alexander Arms® is the originator of the large-caliber, AR-15 style weapon concept. As the leader in the field, we manufacture the best and most reliable weapons. They have an intimate understanding of the function of both the rifle and the ammunition and have in-depth data on both internal, external, and terminal ballistics. In a world of followers, we lead. The .50 Beowulf® was designed to generate devastating stopping power at short to moderate ranges. Combining the rugged reliability of the AR-15/M16 style weapons with a unique .500 inch projectile and cartridge, this semi-automatic weapon is ideal as a brush hunting weapon and is capable of knocking down virtually anything you may run across. For wild pig hunting, the rifle is without equal and is being used not only by hunters, but by game control agencies as well. Deer in close cover are easily taken with solid hits guaranteeing one shot kills and little or no tracking. The same reliable combination of heavy, large-diameter bullets and moderate velocities enable the .50 Beowulf® to tackle the largest game animals found in North America and it has been used against elk, buffalo, and bear with superb results. Providing a semi-automatic, light-carbine with the performance of the venerable 45-70 rifle, the .50 Beowulf® has found wide acceptance with military and law enforcement agencies. The external ballistics of the .50 Beowulf® cartridge are well-suited to urban environments where the shorter range template allows for more flexible application and the large projectile energy delivered by the ammunition can disable both motor vehicles and assailants with body armor. Windscreen glass does not affect the trajectory of the bullet, nor do automotive body panels. With frangible projectiles, the .50 Beowulf® can be used on most training facilities without damage and, with the addition of a muzzle brake to provide a stand-off, can be used for building entry. The combination of devastating stopping power and absolute reliability in a lightweight, familiar form factor, the .50 Beowulf® rifle from Alexander Arms® is simply without equal."

Nyclad is an older self defense hollow point.  It had a reputation for good expansion and, because the bullet profile is close to ball ammo, would feed really well in most guns.

HST is one of the best of the new hollow point designs but it can be hard to find.

If buying all the ammo together $750.00.

If you want the utmost in reliability and ready to shoot out of the box capability you want a Glock 34 Gen 3. A lot of people feel that the Gen 4 was a mistake and that it was change for the sake of change. It turned a rock solid line of pistols into something else. It has tarnished the Glock reputation and if you are serious about competing or any other use where reliability is key then you should get a Gen 3. Look up Gen 3 vs Gen 4 if you think I am exaggerating. There have been numerous issues with the gen 4 and work is often required to make it reliable. There has even been a recall of the recoil spring assembly."

Rohrbaugh pistols are precision CNC machined from solid billets of stainless steel for the slide, barrel and smaller internal parts. Frames are from 7075-T651 aluminum billets. Parts are then hand fit for a superior self-defense weapon where size, weight and deep concealment are of consideration.

The Stealth series slides are coated with Diamond Black (DLC), which reduces friction, increases wear resistance and has anti-galling properties.
About the Manufacturer:
This is a small privately owned US manufacturer of quality precision ultra compact semi-automatic pistols. They have been in steady production since the Spring of 2004, however, its makers have been working on the concept since 1996. Attention to detail is a key factor in the production of these handguns. Due to their high quality many refer to Rohrbauch pistols as the Rolex or Rolls Royce of small defensive pistols.

I'm 1911 and Springfield fan. Wouldn't mind trying out another carry gun either, preferably larger caliber. Let me know what you're offering, worst I can say is no thanks. I have over $500 into this gun so please don't low ball me. I'm not expecting $500 but I don't need to sell it either. I can add cash to even a trade if necessary. Willing to travel some too.

Umarex H&K Heckler Koch MP5 A5 - 22lr
This is the first official Heckler & Koch MP5 chambered in .22 LR. Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5 is engineered as a dedicated .22 rim fire rifle. It's built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. They are proportionate in size to the center fire version's magazine to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine.

I estimate the round count for the .45 slide to be ~50 rounds and a couple hundred for the .22 slide. Great gun, but doesn't fit my hands all that well.

Umarex H&K Heckler Koch MP5 A5 - 22lr
This is the first official Heckler & Koch MP5 chambered in .22 LR. Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5 is engineered as a dedicated .22 rim fire rifle. It's built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. They are proportionate in size to the center fire version's magazine to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine.

I have 4 new, (in original factory bags) DPMS .308 20 round mags for sale. I had a deposit on what was going to be a DPMS SASS so I ordered the mags in anticipation of receiving the rifle. What was received by my dealer was an Armalite B model which I purchased instead which of course will not accept these mags and I don't want to attempt any modifications to them. As you can see by the picture with the invoice I paid $44.94 each plus $8.99 tax for a total of $188.79. I have no clue how much shipping would be but I would think $10.00 should cover it if shipped within the lower 48. So $198.79 to include shipping to anywhere in the lower 48 for all 4 mags sounds fair to me. I will accept US Postal orders only, the price is firm and I don't want to trade.

I am looking for a nice 45cal 1911, Colt, Rem, Kimber, Sig.  Let me know what you have to trade. I am willing to negotiate but lopsided offers will not be responded to.  You can317 text 376or call6036. I attached a screen shot from the Miller website so you can see what a new one costs.  The running gear alone is $330 to buy."

I have a brand new Saiga 12 that has never been fired.  I just purchased the parts to convert the gun to pistol grip and will be doing the conversion once the parts arrive.

I am selling the shotgun that is pictured to the right.  It comes with a 5 round magazine, cleaning rod, oil bottle, all paperwork, etc.  Let me know what you have to trade, I am interested in items listed below as well as other quality firearms.  Please email through Armslist and I will contact you asap.  Must sign a bill of sale and must be legally able to own a firearm (CCW license perferred).  Cash.

As of 1/31/12, I ordered the parts to convert the shotgun to pistol grip.  I will not add the buttstock or the pistol grip if you already have them and the price will be less.  The shotgun on the left was converted for about $200 and a few hours of time.

If you have any questions, please email me and I will be happy to answer...

Thanks,

shooting team, Team Stag Arms, we have determined the features and configuration that will have the broadest appeal and use in competition. With this rifle, competitors are able to produce fast and accurate shots from close to long range as is needed in 3-Gun competitions. 

 Boasting an 18” stainless steel fluted heavy barrel with a rifle length gas system and the new Stag Arms 3G compensator; recoil impulse is greatly reduced allowing for fast follow up shots. Aiding in accuracy is the Samson Evolution handguard, which is free floating and modular, allowing the attachment of rail sections or sling mounts along the handguard. This also grants the shooter the ability to mount accessories as needed but not be burdened with a full quad rail. The trigger is a Geissele Super 3-Gun trigger, which was specifically developed for 3-Gun competitions, as the name implies. It possesses a great reputation for durability and has what Geissele calls a hybrid pull. This hybrid pull is a unique combination of a single and two-stage that allows for both quick close range shots and more deliberate long range shots. The buttstock and pistol grip are from Magpul featuring their collapsible ACS buttstock that provides a comfortable cheek weld along with storage and their MOE pistol grip that provides a solid and secure grip. The rifle also is available with optional Dueck Defense Rapid Transition Sights (RTS) which are offset iron sights that are used for close in shots.

I have a brand new DPMS LR-308 precision AR chambered in .308 up for sale or trade. Gun has a rifle length free float aluminum handguard and a heavy threaded barrel. This gun has only had two boxes fired through it and comes with the bipod, and the 6x18x44 scope pictured. Gun also has the soft case and all the paperwork it came with when I bought it as well as the factory magazine, I might even have a couple boxes of .308 left to throw in. This may be one of your last chances to get a .308 AR10 varient and especially in this condition! Most everyone is asking closer to $3000 for this rifle right now so I believe my asking price of $2500 OBO for trade on everything is decent. I will work with you on the price if you are wanting to buy it straight across with cash. I am looking to trade for a few things right now and they are as listed:
Full size or possibly compact Springfield XDM or XD in .40 or .45 + cash
Full size M&P in 9mm, .40 or .45 + cash
Full size Glock in 9mm, .40 or .45 + cash
1911 varient + cash
AK47 varient + cash
Nice bolt action rifle in 30 caliber or larger + cash
OR I AM WILLING TO TRADE STRAIGHT ACROSS for a motorcycle or 4x4 truck/SUV or a couple older dirt bikes.

I am willing to do more then one gun on trade to even out the price, but I do need some cash on this deal unless you have a streetbike, 4x4 truck/SUV or a couple dirt bikes then as I said I would trade you straight across. This post will remain up until the deal has been made on the DPMS at which point I will take it down so there is no need to ask if it is still available. Send me pics of what you are offering to trade or I won't respond to you, and please only serious offers or inquiries.

Trade value is $2500 OBO and I don't want any low ballers, if you wanna buy it straight across I will work with you on the price. Thank you."
