Hello, I am selling my Smith and Wesson M&P Pro Series handgun, chambered in 40 S&W. The Pro models are hard to find (try the local shops and see how you do) and feature a factory upgraded trigger and factory night sights.

This is the standard full size slide and barrel (4.25 inches) and is great for carry.

All M&P handguns feature:
-Three interchangeable backstraps to fit any hand which you can swap without tools in under ten seconds.
- Fully ambidextrous controls, with a slide stop on both sides of the frame and a magazine release that can be swapped for right or left handed shooters.
-Lightweight Polymer Frame
-Stainless Steel Slide, coated in Melonite (very hard)

This Pro Series Model adds:
-4 1/2 pound trigger pull
-Factory Night Sights (Trijicon)
-4.25 inch barrel (standard length barrel, great for carry)
-Magazine Capacity of 15 rounds (40 S&W)

Regular M&P .40 models (without night sights) retail for $530 at Cabelas, you can purchase a factory upgraded gun here (with night sights) at a better price (without taxes) and get a whole package to run TWO calibers.

This model has an MSRP of near $700.

I am selling because I’m moving away from polymer frames. They work reliably and weigh less for carry, but I just shoot my DA/SA metal frames better.


I also will sell the M&P Pro as it came from Smith and Wesson (M&P Pro .40, Two .40 Magazines) for $500 OBO.

The only trade I will entertain is for a Gen 4 Glock 19 because my father is interested in one.

Those serial # were 534000/599000.- ""mine has #'s in that range""
After the 8 September 1943 armistice between Italy and the Allies, the Germans saddled Beretta with three engineers from Germany. Moreover the factory was garrisoned by the SS... Weapons of that time, even the ones produced for the Germans, bore the punch mark 4UT
(Quarto Ufficio tecnico di Controllo Armi e Munizioni--4th Technnical Control Unit
an C. Still, in Axis Pistols, page 107, states,
""It is likely that almost all of the 4/UT, ...were used by the German Army"". He also includes two other variations in this statement, ""1944 dated and blank slide Model 1935"".
Ugo Menchini, in Pietro Beretta Le Automatiche, regarding an M1934, page 255, states,
""In late 1940 there appears an oval including the punch mark IVU. It refers to the 4th technical Control Unit of the FAG, where inspection was carried out.""
Note that, while they seem to represent the same inspectors, the ""IVU"" is not
the same mark as the ""4UT"". The IVU would be found on the pre RSI model M1934, and the 4UT would be found on the RSI model M1935.
These are the reasons why I believe that it is likely that all of the 4UT Berettas were RSI pistols.

I bought this in 2008 for target shooting and rabbit hunting.  It is a great rifle setup, especially is you can shoot with two eyes open. You can spot and focus quickly a rabbit in the brush.  I played with all sorts of rounds, but found the subsonic ones extremely accurate at 50M, plenty tight shot groups for rabbits and squirrels.  

The scope is a Nikon Monarch UCC with magnification of 1.75X, objective diameter of 20mm, and an eye relief appropriate for scout type use. 

The rifle is a Browning takedown SA22, .22 long rifle, grade II, gray laminated stock, stainless steel, with an octagonal 19 3/8 inch barrel.  With the exception of the additional scope it is just as originally purchased.  The original open sight is included, but not installed.     

Also included are the original box and paperwork, original receipt for the rifle and scope, bi-pod, spotting scope, case that fits the rifle taken down, and some rifle rests, as well as some other miscellaneous items.  It is a good kit ready for the range, or back woods.

I have a Rossi long gun that has 2 switchable barrels. It can be a 22LR or a 20 gauge shotgun (single shot breakover either way). It is not perfect, but it's not junk. 

I believe its a ""youth model"" so it is a little short, but the compact size is PERFECT for keeping in a vehicle or when you need something fast in the house for protection. I used it as a truck gun, and it's very reliable, fun, and for THIS price you can't beat it.

Price: $1250 cash or $1400 trade value
This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. I have much more invested in this weapon than my asking price. 
Price: $950 cash or $1050 trade value
This rifle is the most accurate AR that I have ever shot. This is a DPMS AR-15 with an A2 stock and a 20 inch long, 1 inch diameter stainless bull barrel. This rifle has a free floating barrel and a free floating DPMS handguard, forward assist, and dust covers. The rifle also has a 6-24x44 scope that has not been sighted in. The scope has been mounted on a top rail scope mount. The rifle also has a bipod mounted. This rifle has a railed gas block and will come with two magazines as well. The stock has a few knicks and dings but nothing major. This came from shooting on a bench. The gun has been fired very little and hasn't been fired since I mounted the scope. 

Will make someone a good deal if they purchase the package."

(1) NIB LUCID 2x-5x Variable Magnifier
(1) NIB ADM Swing Off Magnifier Mount
(1) LUCID Valid Lifetime Limited Warranty

LUCID sights are relatively new to the optics arena but have garnered nothing but great reviews, esp. for their price point. I can tell you from personal experience that they are comparable to Eotechs and Aimpoints at about half to a third of the price. Constructed around an aluminum frame, they are durable and sport a nice crisp sight picture.

LUCID 2x-5x Variable Magnifier

LUCID is proud to introduce the worlds first variable magnifier for red dot sights. At LUCID, they understand the need to transition quickly between close quarter and target engagement that may be further out. Maintaining quality target identification and precision shot placement through this transition is a must. This ability is now yours with LUCID's new 2x - 5x variable power magnifier. LUCID's variable magnifier mounts behind any red dot sight and expands your capability by offering target identification and pinpoint accuracy. This high quality optic offers crystal clear optical performance and maintains an expansive field of view with comfortable eye relief through the entire magnification range.

ADM Swing Off Magnifier Mount

The AD-SM-01 Magnifier Swing Off Mount features a lower 1/3rd co-witness. It enables the operator to flip the magnifier out of view for an unmagnified sight picture. It is configurable for a right or left direction of flip. It is precision machined from 6061 T6 aluminum and finished in hard coat T3 anodize. It features the Patented QD Auto Lock™ Lever system to accommodate both in spec and out of spec rail systems.

NOTE: This is a Lower 1/3 Co-Witness Size Mount. Please make sure your optic mount is Lower 1/3 Co-Witness before purchasing!

It is pretty much brand new as he only bought it last month and hasnt even fired the Bersa. It is the satin Nickel model and the Sugested retail price is 389.00 however Im asking almost half that. I did a search and the cheapest I can find it in the Knoxville area is 289.00 and that doesnt include tax and background check and all that which would make it be well over 350.00 if you were to buy the same gun.
It is new and unfired except when the factory test fired it as do all gun makers.
 Its an excellent carry gun for concealment and one of the most popular selling firearms on the market and Bersas number one selling make and model according to their website.

Description,
New for 2011 from SIG SAUER (www.sigsauer.com) is the P238 Special Edition Rainbow Titanium finish pistol with Rosewood Grips. The P238 is a sub-compact (5.5"" long) .380 that weighs only 15.2 ounces with a six round magazine. It is one of the smallest .380's available and the Rainbow's mirror polished titanium slide finish makes it unique. It looks like titanium jewelry and shoots like, well, a SIG. It may well be the ultimate in an all-metal frame, concealed carry pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy, beavertail style frame with rosewood grips for comfort and a secure hold. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Rainbow Titanium finish and SigLite Night Sights.

This SIG SAUER P238 Rainbow is supplied in a very nice, padded hard case with instructions, gunlock, a polymer holster and a single six round magazine. Spare magazines carry a 2010 MSRP of $44. At present, there is not a ""plus one"" or ""plus two"" magazine option with a pinky finger rest, which is a pity. Such a magazine would make holding and shooting the P238 more comfortable, as it has a ""two finger"" length grip.

Included with the pistol is a simple, but functional, molded polymer holster. This right hand holster clips over the belt to the waistband of trousers and is worn externally. It holds the P238 by means of screw tension, which can be adjusted by means of an Allan-head bolt. This simple holster holds the pistol securely at the wearer's side, yet allows for a speedy draw. Worn behind the right hip and covered by a light jacket, such as a poplin windbreaker, it is quite inconspicuous. It can also be worn cross-draw in the spleen position. Unfortunately for left-handed shooters, it is not ambidextrous, but it is great for everyone else.

The Owner's Manual is so larded with safety warnings that it is difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. Apparently, you should not buy a gun and, if you do, you should not handle it. Actually shooting a firearm is so dangerous that it should not be attempted. Keep your pistol locked away where no one can reach it. Ho, hum.

SIG currently offers eleven variations of the P238, differing mostly in finish and minor features. The basic, all flat-black Nitron model starts at $629 and other models sell for as much as $749 (the Tactical Laser model, which comes with a laser sight). The Rainbow Titanium, along with most other P238's sporting wood grips, carries a 2010 MSRP of $699. Other P238 models have been readily available, but the Special Edition Rainbow Titanium has been in short supply since it was announced. It was not until August 2010 that we finally received a sample for review. Fortunately, it was worth the wait. From a practical point of view, this pistol should be largely impervious to its environment due to its titanium-plated, stainless steel slide and hard-anodized aluminum alloy frame. One might think that a pistol this pretty would not be so durable, but it is. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the Special Edition Rainbow Titanium looks like jewelry. Not just the slide, but all of the visible steel parts are mirror polished and titanium plated. These include the Allan head grip screws, safety lever, take down/slide stop lever and magazine release button.

Unlike the previous fixed barrel, blowback action, DA/SA P230 and P232 .380 pistols, the P238 is a single action (SA), short recoil operated (tip barrel), autoloading pistol with an exposed hammer. In grip angle, silhouette and most other respects, it is a miniature 1911 Government Model pistol. Unlike most .380 pistols of any brand, it is a locked-breech design, not blowback operated. The locked breech design of the P238 makes it easier to rack the slide than with blowback pistols, which require a very heavy slide return spring to augment the inertia of the slide and keep it closed long enough for the bullet to leave the chamber. There is a Colt Series 80 type firing pin block that prevents movement of the firing pin (and thus discharging the pistol) unless the trigger is pulled rearward. The rear of the chamber is wedged against the face of the slide to lock the pistol closed, much as with a Glock pistol and unlike the barrel lugs used in 1911 pistols.

This is a conventional SA pistol, despite its exotic and colorful Titanium finish. The P238 reminds us of the discontinued Colt .380 Mustang Pocketlite that it closely resembles, which was also a short recoil operated, locked breech, SA sub-compact. The word is that SIG SAUER purchased the rights and the machinery to produce the Mustang (as the P238) from Colt. The P238's external slide contours are SIG, but its frame is shaped almost identically to the Mustang and most of the internal parts appear to be interchangeable. The operation of the P238 should also seem familiar to any fan of the Colt Mustang. It works the same way and the control layout is the same. It also takes down like a Colt Mustang. The P238's ejector is a pivoting type pinned to the left inside of the frame; when reassembling the pistol after takedown, depress the ejector as you run the slide assembly back on its rails.

There are three safety features. The first is a manual thumb safety. This disconnects the trigger and, if the hammer is down, prevents the hammer from being cocked or the slide opened. Apply the thumb safety with the hammer at full cock and the hammer cannot be lowered, but the slide can be operated; very handy for unloading a pistol carried ""cocked and locked"" (condition one).

The second safety device is an automatic firing pin block. This prevents the firing pin from moving forward unless the trigger is pulled rearward. (Pulling the trigger disengages the firing pin block.) It serves as a drop safety and might prevent an accidental discharge (AD) should the manual safety malfunction on a pistol carried ""cocked and locked.""

The third safety feature is a half-cock hammer notch. This is intended to catch the hammer should it slip when being manually cocked or lowered, as long as the trigger is not simultaneously pulled rearward. Using the half-cock hammer notch is NOT a safe carry method, as pulling the trigger will drop the hammer from its half-cock notch.

There is no grip safety or magazine disconnect safety on the P238. It will fire with the magazine removed or if gripped improperly, as long as there is a cartridge in the chamber and the trigger is pulled. Most shooters dislike these types of safeties and feel they are redundant. Real gun safety, of course, is between the shooter's ears.

The aluminum trigger of our test pistol released at a very heavy 8.5 pounds after a long, two-stage take-up. This is totally unacceptable for a SA pistol, whose primary reason for existence is supposed to be a short, light, clean trigger pull. The P238's trigger is clearly inferior to several staff owned Baikal IJ-70 (Makarov) .380 pistols that cost a fraction of the price of the P238. It is way inferior to the 4.4 pound SA trigger pull of contemporary SIG P232 .380 pistols. The P238 trigger is a disgrace and should be rectified immediately. Before we would consider using this pistol for serious self-defense/concealed carry, it will require a trigger job.

The P238's sights, on the other hand, are excellent. They are high visibility, Patridge type, three dot, tritium night sights. These sights are the best we have ever encountered on a sub-compact pistol, as good as the sights on SIG full size service pistols. For once, a manufacturer did not scrimp on a .380 pocket pistol's sights.

The .380 ACP (9x17mm) cartridge is considered a powerful stopper in Europe, where it has a long history as a police service cartridge, but a mouse gun cartridge in the U.S. The reality is somewhere between, but in this case the Europeans are closer to reality. Certainly, the 9mm Luger (9x19mm) cartridge can launch a heavier bullet of the same diameter somewhat faster and the .38 Super or .357 SIG are faster yet. All of these exceed the maximum stopping power of the .380 ACP, given JHP bullets of similar terminal performance. On the other hand, modern .380 loads using JHP bullets like the Federal Hydra-Shok deliver serious stopping power, similar to a .38 Special snub-nose revolver with similar JHP bullets. Thus, .380 pistols are certainly not mouse guns. Nobody in their right mind would want to be shot by a .38 Special revolver or a .380 ACP pistol, no matter how much they might belittle their stopping power! In their extensive stopping power study, Marshal and Sanow found that the Federal 95 grain JHP .380 factory load delivered about 65% one shot stops, compared to 64% one shot stops for the Federal 125 grain JHP .38 Spec. factory load fired from a 2"" barrel revolver. To illustrate how important it is to choose a bullet that expands reliably, the (non-expanding) Federal 230 grain FMJ .45 ACP load delivered 64% one shot stops (mostly from a 5"" barrel), virtually identical to the short barreled .38 snubby and .380 Auto with JHP ammunition!

Since the P238 is intended for concealed carry, how it is carried deserves comment. Like other traditional SA semi-automatics, there are three possible carry modes for the SIG P238:

    Condition One is ""cocked and locked."" This means both the magazine and chamber are loaded, the hammer is cocked and the thumb safety is ON. To shoot the pistol, just push the safety down to the ""FIRE"" position and pull the trigger. Fast and it takes only one hand to accomplish, but you are relying primarily on the manual safety to prevent an accidental discharge and we have seen manual safeties malfunction and shooters muff their operation under stress. The P238 does have a firing pin block, which helps to prevent AD's if you keep your finger off the trigger until the moment you intend to shoot.
    Condition Two is fully loaded (both magazine and chamber) with the hammer down on the loaded chamber. The thumb safety is always OFF, but the firing pin does not touch the primer and the firing pin safety prevents its doing so, even if the pistol is dropped. To shoot the pistol, manually cock the hammer and pull the trigger. Both actions can be performed by the shooting hand, but the hammer is small and the hand cannot assume a shooting grip until after the hammer is manually cocked. There is a half-cock hammer notch to catch the hammer if it slips, as long as the trigger is not pulled at the time.
    Condition Three is loaded magazine, but empty chamber. The thumb safety is always OFF. To shoot the pistol the slide must first be racked to chamber a cartridge, then the trigger pulled. This is the safest method of carry and the method specified by the U.S. Army for the 1911 pistol carried in the full-flap military holster, but it takes two hands and you may not have both hands free during a sudden, life and death emergency. Also racking the slide requires some hand strength and there is the possibility of short stroking the slide, failing to chamber a cartridge. In that event, you get a click instead of a bang when you pull the trigger and, in all likelihood, you are dead a second later. (Tip: carrying a Condition Three pistol with the hammer in the full cock position is completely safe, since the chamber is empty, and makes cycling the slide easier.)

None of these alternatives is ideal and all have advantages and disadvantages, so the intended condition of carry should be carefully considered by any potential P238 purchaser. SIG's other current .380 pistol, the DA/SA SIG P232, can be carried hammer down in complete safety yet fired simply by pulling the trigger. (There is no manual safety on the P232 to manipulate--and possibly flub--in an emergency). The P238 is smaller, lighter and easier to carry than the P232, but all three SA auto carry modes compromise either safety, simplicity, or speed. There is no ""correct"" carry mode for a single action autoloader. Choose the mode that suits you best.

For our test shooting with the P238, we journeyed to the Izaak Walton gun range south of Eugene, Oregon. This outdoor facility has covered shooting positions with bench rests and target stands at 25, 50, 100 and 200 yards. With the sub-compact SIG P238, we conducted our test shooting at 25 yards, our standard range for pistol testing. The western Oregon summer weather was partly cloudy, with a high of about 75-degrees F. and 10-15 MPH winds. Nice pistol shooting weather!

For test ammunition we used Remington/UMC 95 grain FMJ (955 fps), Winchester/USA 95 grain FMJ (955 fps), Blazer 88 grain JHP (1000 fps) and Federal Premium Personal Protection 90 grain Hydra-Shok JHP (1000 fps) factory loads. We shot five-shot groups for record at 25 yards using a Pistol Perch rest. Guns and Shooting Online staff members Jim Fleck, Robert Fleck, Gordon Landers and Chuck Hawks did the test shooting.

Shooting Results

    Federal 90 grain Hydra-Shok JHP - smallest group 1-3/4"", largest group 3"", mean average group size = 2.5""
    Blazer 88 grain JHP - smallest group 4-3/8"", largest group 7-5/8"", mean average group size = 5.5""
    Remington/UMC 95 grain FMJ - smallest group 3"", largest group 7-1/8"", mean average group size = 5.7""
    Winchester/USA 95 grain FMJ - smallest group 5-1/4"", largest group 7-1/4"", mean average group size = 6.6""

This time out, Jim shot the smallest group. We were pleased that the P238 did its best work with the Federal Premium Personal Protection 90 grain Hydra-Shok load, as this is the load we would choose for concealed carry.

The primers of the fired cases that we inspected evidenced a light firing pin blow, but there were no malfunctions from this. The P238 fired first time, every time the hammer dropped.

Unfortunately, the super heavy trigger made a mockery of our attempt to shoot the little P238 for accuracy. It is impossible to consistently shoot decent groups or explore a pistol's accuracy potential when the trigger pull is nine times the weight of the gun itself! The lighter the gun, the lighter the trigger pull should be. All shooters felt that with a decent trigger pull, the P238 would deliver much better groups and the occasional good group we fired tended to confirm that thinking. Unfortunately, because of the terrible trigger, the practical accuracy of the P238 is unacceptable and all three shooters had tender trigger fingers from the super heavy pull by the end of the test shooting. The wear on trigger fingers was accellerated by the sharp longitudinal grooves cut into the face of the trigger. We'd like to see a smooth trigger in this pistol.

Our staff gunsmith, Rocky Hays, is going to see what he can do to lighten the P238's trigger pull. We have ordered a reduced force mainspring from Wolff springs (the P238 uses the same springs as the Colt Mustang). The sear engagement notch on our test pistol seems smooth and clean, so it is unlikely that much would be gained by honing these engagement surfaces.

While we are on the subject of springs, the necessarily small recoil spring in the P238 (after all, the effective length of the recoil spring guide rod is only 1-7/8""), takes an unavoidable beating during operation and SIG recommends it be replaced every 1500 rounds. Some owners have reported recoil spring life as short as about 500 rounds. Either way, that is a considerable amount of shooting with a .380 pocket pistol, so recoil springs are unlikely to become a serious financial drain. SIG offers P238 replacement spring packs and Wolff sells both standard rate and heavy duty recoil springs for the Colt Mustang/SIG P238.

We had two malfunctions in the course of our test shooting. Both were failures to feed that resulted from the slide locking open. In both cases, the fired case was ejected cleanly. This happened once with the Federal Premium Hydra-Shok load with Chuck shooting and once with the Winchester FMJ load with Gordon shooting. We were unable to determine the cause of these malfunctions. We suspected that, as the pistol recoiled, the shooter had accidentally bumped the slide stop upward with his thumb. We did our test shooting with a two-handed grip and the shooter's thumbs wound-up positioned directly under the slide stop. It is, after all, a very small gun.

For comparison, we had an all stainless steel Walther PPK at the range. (There is a review of the PPK on the ""Handgun Articles and Reviews"" index page of the Handgun Information Page.) It was interesting that, although the P238 is smaller and lighter than the PPK, it also (subjectively) kicked less. We attribute that to its locked-breech action; the Walther is a blowback action. On the other hand, the Walther had a much better SA trigger pull and a fixed barrel and it easily out shot the P238 in the accuracy department. In terms of recoil, though, the little SIG is a comparatively pleasant gun to shoot.

Everyone on the Guns and Shooting Online staff was favorably impressed by the little P238 Rainbow Titanium.

It is a replica of a H&K MP5, and this is the original not the GSG-522 model which they started to manufacture after the lawsuit they lost.

I bought this gun used about 6 months ago, and have run about 1,000 rounds through it. I put a collapsible stock on it, a see-through rail and a BSA red-dot type scope. The previous owner completed the buffer tube mod and replaced the screws with the HK-style push pins.  It is a really fun gun to plink with and do Rambo-style mag dumps that attract even the shyest of range goers.

The barrel shroud (fake suppressor) is the legal one; I have already run the serial# on ATF's website. I have (1) 22rd magazine, the box that came with it as well as the extra sight posts.

[B]THE HONEST CONDITION OF THIS THING[/B]: It was a used gun when I got it and it still looks like it.  What I mean by that is it has some scuffs here and there.  If you look at the pictures you can see them very clearly if you blow it up to full resolution.  

The barrel shroud has some paint chips and scuffs at the muzzle which look like they were touched up.

The collapsible stocks rails were fitted directly to this gun for a solid fit and there was some paint removed from the top of the rails during the process.  What that adds up to is a VERY SOLID collapsible stock.

One last thing: when I got the GSG, the previous owner told me that the bolt-hold-open spring *zing*ed across the room the last time he broke it down; so, he removed the lever and just shot it as-is with no last round hold-open feature.  I still have the lever with the extra sight posts as replacing this spring was never high on my to-do list and the gun is just as fun without it.

This gun functions best with a Remington copper plated bulk ammo and a squeaky clean chamber.  When it gets chamber gets polluted with .22 carbon, it will not allow the bolt to go fully into battery sometimes.  SO KEEP IT CLEAN!

Because of the above-mentioned caveats, I am sacrificing this bucket-o-fun for an amazingly fair [B]$300 or trade[/B] for something else fun.  I'll even kick in a little cash if it is fair. (HD Pump shotguns, OD Glocks or a G17/G26, Bolt Rifles, other .22lr range toys are all welcome.  Also, any LEO gear you may be trying to find a new home for would also be useful . . . handcuffs, knives, tac-lights and the like.)"

This is the Hawk 12 gauge shotgun, with a squared-off, Browning-looking receiver imported by H&R 1871, New England Firearms. We have had excellent service experience with the Hawk 12 gauge imported by other companies, but we know from years of experience that New England Firearms Service is second to none, on the rare occasion that it is needed. This New-England Hawk Import is slicker finished than its Interstate Arms siblings, and it has the standard Police Cylinder 18 1/2 inch barrel. We have outfitted it with an extra AT, Advanced Technologies, cruiser pistol grip. This listing, then, is for a combo since it has both buttstocks. Note that its barrel lug is 3 inches forward toward the muzzle than a comparable 870 Remington, hence the different specs from standard 870s: chambering is for both 2 3/4 inch and 3 inch shells, capacity is 5 + 1 for 2 3/4 inchers, equal to the standard Mossberg 500 capacity. Weight empty is a well balanced, comfortable shooting 7 pounds, and it comes with weather-resistant black synthetic stock and forend. Length of pull with buttstock installed is 38 1/2 inches with a standard 
length of pull from the face of the smooth faced combat trigger to the end of the 1 inch pad on the buttstock; and overall length including pistol grip installed as shown is 29 inches.

Its in very great shape and shoots even better. I have had the Glock for a little over a year now and bought new from a vendor at one of the gun shows for 600 without any of these extras. This glock has a tactical rail. It comes with the following 
2 15 round glock mags
2 15 round KCI mads
1 33 round glock mag with a glock speed loader 
an ITAC paddle retention holster
the glock case, brush, and tool, and cable lock. I have also bought a Ghost 3.5 trigger kit but decided that the factory 5.5 lbs was plenty good, the 3.5 just makes it too crazy for me like you barely have to touch the trigger. So the glock currently is all factory but will also come with extended mag release and slide stop lever and extended take down lever. The glock has adjustable rear sights and comes with tool. Please feel free to ask any question, this is a great deal. The only thing I would be willing to do a trade on is an AR-15. Springfield pick up only, and will want to do a bill of sale.

While these are not up to cowboy action specs in formal settings, they are excellent rifles and have always been favorites of deer woods hunters here in the hills of West Tennessee and Northeast Mississippi, often known simply as Tennessippi. Caliber is .45-70 Government, break-open single shot with breech lever beside the serrated hammer; barrel is 18 3/4 inch Heavy Barrel, .905 outside diameter at the muzzle, and the muzzle is recessed. Rate of twist is 1:14 right hand. Finish is matte blue steel, both barrel and receiver with purple-tinted hardened steel .300 serrated spur hammer and .300 smooth face trigger. Buttstock and forend are walnut-stained American hardwood, and blue steel sling swivel studs come already installed. Sights are Williams Notched blade rear that is ramp mounted and adjustable for windage and elevation; front sight is modified partridge blade mounted on a serrated ramp, also Williams manufacture. Overall length is a compact 34 1/8 inches; and length of pull measures 14 1/8 inches from the face of the trigger to the back of the 1 inch factory recoil pad. Weight empty is a well balanced 6 pounds 4.4 ounces; and the center of gravity feels about 1 inch forward of the trigger guard. This rifle’s barrel is drilled and tapped for scope mounting in 3 positions atop the chamber area, as they have been for years. Hammer spur is no longer included, but Uncle Mike’s #2456 Hammer Extensions fit nicely and are readily available throughout the country. The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks has included this rifle as eligible for our Sister State’s Primitive Weapons deer season.  Replacement price on these fine rifles is upwards of $400 apiece in our area. We’re offering the .45-70 Handi-Rifle in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, 		for only	$ 269.00.

Here is an excellent Chinese copy, and in some respects an improvement on, the workhorse Remington 870. Since the 870 was introduced in 1950, its patent probably expired in 2000, hence these excellent tributes to the Wingmaster. These are imports from IAC, Interstate Arms Co. of Billerica, Massachusetts, and they are fine shotguns. Finish is entirely matte black with classic corncob 870P type forends in black synthetic, and matching buttstock with a nice thick recoil pad. Sight is the classic and popular military Ghost Ring peep sight setup. Weight empty is about 7 1/2 pounds. Note the mar on the finish. It's a safe assumption that none of the 982 Hawks will be cosmetically perfect, and these most emphatically are NOT seconds. Credit finish mars to the rice paper boxes that these come in, even though Chinese boxmanship has improved over the last decade. Nevertheless these are solid, quality shotguns and attractive finishwise. All of them are brand new in their original boxes, and we take great pains with rice-boxed guns when we ship them. Note the high visibility orange follower. Magazine capacity is five rounds on these, note the extended section of the magazine forward of the barrel lug. Capacity, then, is a total of 6 rounds of either 2 3/4  inch or 3 inch shells. Choke constriction is standard Cylinder Bore, .718 - .720.

Not since military production on the M-1 Carbine has there been a credible reintroduction of that classic, until a rejuvenated Auto Ordnance Corporation, under control of Kahr Arms, began production in 2005. All others were mongrel parts guns like the Universals and somewhat better made Plainfields. Here is Auto Ordnance’s reintroduction of the most sought after of all carbines, the M1A1 that was produced during World War II in relatively small numbers. Few of us will get the chance, or be able to afford, to own a mint condition M1A1. Here is as close as most of us will ever come: The Auto Ordnance AOM150 Carbine with Metal Folding Stock and Walnut main stock. Construction is completely milled steel barrel and receiver, with steel trigger goup, all of it parkerized, and with correct bright blue steel mounting junctures for the parkerized steel folding stock frame. Buttplate is serrated, spring-loaded swiveling cast brass. Sights are early WWII type two-leaf aperture, and safety is Early War type as well, push-button. Manufacturer’s marking, Auto Ordnance / Worcester, MA, located behind the rear sight. Detailing is correct, even down to the genuine leather cheek piece with its brass retaining rivets. Magazine included is a current production blue steel AOC 15 rounder. This is more than a classic, it’s a slick made carbine, slicker and more smoothly finished than even the originals were. A Mint Condition M1A1 commands pricing in the five figures many times.

Photo specimen represents the original variant of Kel Tec's High Capacity 9mm Compact, the P11, blue steel slide with black polymer grip frame. The P-11 is the pistol that propelled Kel-Tec to respectability and even stardom in our Industry. It works, it’s garbage-mouthed; it will feed anything from Russian steel case ammo to the finest Remington Golden Saber on the market. The P-11 is accurate, too, note the similarity of the barrel’s muzzle collar to the Smith & Wesson 5906. Though not as flat as its descendant PF9, the P-11 is still a thin-enough pistol with lots of firepower. Dimensions are: barrel length 3 inches; maximum height 5 inches; overall length 6 inches; frame thickness 1.05 inches; weight empty with magazine in battery 17 oz.; 3-dot sight configuration. The P-11 is, of course, double action only. It has a hammer, but the hammer never stands. Herein lies its safety feature: in addition to the firing pin block safety that prevents firing if the pistol is dropped, the only way the pistol will fire is by a stiff deliberate pull of the trigger, long travel double action pull with pressure of 8 to 10 pounds. The Kel-Tec is good pistol. Out of several hundred we have sold over the past three decades, we have sent fewer than 20 back to the factory for repair or service. This small pistol, however, may not be suitable for people unfamiliar with automatics. New gun owners and arthritic folk with weak grasp capabilities should stick with the simple, safe, double action revolvers. This one comes with its original Mec-Gar factory issue 10-shot magazine. This Kel-Tec will accept any Smith & Wesson 59, 669, 6900 or 5900 type magazine, even the 20 rounders. Replacement price on this pistol in our area is $300 or more, when a person can even find one. We're offering the P-11 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates 		for only	$ 259.00		Not transferable to civilian residents of California, D.C., Massachusetts, or New York City. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $10 lower 48; $30 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority Mail, insured with Delivery Confirmation.

First, we recommend against inexperienced shooters owning auto pistols in the first place: novice gun owners should start out with revolvers, not with autos. Small autos by their nature must have stiff recoil springs, and that makes the slide hard to operate in order for a person to chamber the first round or unload the pistol. Subcompacts, especially the PF-9, are not for the faint of heart or weak of hand. Felt recoil is substantial. Second, dealing plastic guns is not exactly our overriding passion, but here is a good one, worth the money, and we give Kel-Tec Company credit for producing a good cheap gun, emphasis on good. From our personal experience selling them, there is a less than 3% return ratio; that is, fewer than 3 out of 100 have to go back to the factory for service. That’s a good ratio in anybody’s book. This is the latest, thinnest variant of the Kel-Tec auto, the P9F, F for Flat, with frame rail. This one is the PF-9 variant with Olive Drab Green polymer grip frame and blue steel slide. A light or laser mount would add to the .890 thickness, of course. Factory specs on the P9F are as follows: Average Maximum Thickness  .890;  Semi-Auto Pistol Double Action Only;  Caliber 9  Barrel Length 3 inches; Capacity 7 + 1; Hammer Block Safety; ultra high impact polymer grip frame; 3 dot sights with drift windage adjustable rear; weight 12.7 oz empty; blue steel slide. Photos show an actual specimen we had in stock. Its grip frame is traditional colored OD Green for a very untraditional pistol. They come in Black Frame, Green Frame, and Gray Frame, and we have no choice over which frame color we'll get. This pistol is flat enough and compact enough to carry in a Michaels #1 Ankle Holster; our photographer constantly wears one. The smaller Kel-Tecs, he reports, spin around his ankle, but the PF-9 stays put on his left ankle very well. Own one of these good, light, flat little pistols for only 	$ 259.00 	Not transferable to civilian residents of California, D.C., or Massachusetts. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $10 lower 48; $30 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority Mail, insured with Delivery Confirmation.

Here is the first and most effective pistol Kel-Tec marketed, the P-32 in .32 ACP. The round is very effective, attest its widespread use among Police Departments in Europe. While the .32 ACP is not as effective as a .22 Magnum, it is one of the next best rounds. This little Kel-Tec is only .755 thick at the back of the frame, it weighs 8 ounces empty, and it is a very simple full time double action pistol that holds 7 rounds in its factory-issued Mec-Gar brand magazine. Kel-Tecs are incredibly simply to operate, but their springs are stout and inexperienced shooters would be better served with a simple double action revolver, especially is they have a weak grip or arthritis. One reason we sell Kel-Tecs is their amazingly low return ratio; fewer than 1 out of 100 we have sold locally required any service. Own the fine, flat little Kel-Tec, the one in the photos or one of its identical mates, 		for only	 only 	$ 239.00 	Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, Massachusetts, or New York City.

Here is what our photographer calls a Texas Mossberg, the Maverick 88 that is identical to the 500 Mossberg he used to carry on his tractor to dispatch various varmints before he lost the old Ford 3000 to one of his ex-wives. The Maverick in the photo is one of only a few we were able to get since the election. They're excellent shotguns, by no means beauty queens but they'll stay with you and work, something our photographer values in women and shotguns more than he does good looks and high maintenance. Weight empty is only 7 pounds, barrel is 2 3/4 or 3 inch chambered 20 inch Cylinder Bore; magazine capacity is 7 plus 1; overall length is only 40 1/2 inches. The Mavericks have double slide bars just like their New England grandmothers, the 500s; and they work unfailingly in dust and rain. Retail price on these in our area now approaches the $300 mark.

This isn’t an HK 91A2, those stopped in 1989; and it certainly isn’t C&R Eligible. It is, however, the best quality clone of the Heckler & Koch HK91A2 rifle that has been prohibited from importation since the Elder Bush's action. PTR 91 Inc. is a Connecticut manufacturing firm in business since 1997. This is their PTR-91KF variant, factory product code 915150. Here is what the company says about their rifles: The PTR 91 was developed with the tooling from the H&K licensed G3 arms plant in Portugal, and retains the major design features of this well engineered popular rifle. With most major parts manufactured in the US, the current rifle models feature a retarded blow back system, .75 inch diameter Match Grade 4 groove barrel with 1:12 right hand twist, all black furniture and powder-coated barrel. Other specs are: Semi-Automatic rifle, caliber .308 Winchester; 16 inch barrel with flash hider / muzzle brake; capacity 20 + 1, standard trigger, lever safety, overall length 40 inches; weight empty 9.17 pounds; black finish with black synthetic stock and forend. What others say is important; all the impartial reviews we have read praise the rifle, see the many postings on High Road, for one. Replacement pricing on original HK 91 rifles ranges upwards of $3,000 apiece; and the PTR-91 commands prices in our area in the $1500.00 range. Photos show the original brand new magazine plus three extra German Army surplus mags that we are including. We're furnishing a limited offering of only a handful of these fine rifles, however, complete with a total of four steel magazines, one new and three used German surplus, each for only 		$ 989.00. 	2 % discount  if paid by USPS Money Orders and not credit card.

Rossi has been producing slick, quality copies of the fabled 1892 Winchester since the 1960s at earliest, perhaps longer, and we have always sold them. Photo shows the very first stainless steel specimen of the 92 in .45 Colt we’ve been able to get our hands one. Note that the magazine band and steel buttplate are also stainless colored. Buttstock and forend appear to be Brazilian Walnut, but we are not entirely clear on that, factory specs claim that it is walnut. Apart from its bright stainless finish, and a few original Winchester 1892 rifles were nickel plated down through the years, the only non-traditional aspect to this rifle is its bolt mounted firing pin safety, and the Rossi company has done a good job keeping that as inconspicuous as possible. Caliber, of course, is .45 Long Colt; and capacity is 10 + 1. Sights are traditional blue steel post type front with step elevator blue steel rear, as the photos show. Weight empty is a light fast 6.1 pounds. Length of pull from the center of the trigger to the center of the buttplate is only 12 1/2 inches, so this rifle comes close to a youth length; overall length is only 37 inches including the 20 inch round barrel. Rate of twist is a very slow 1:32. These fine rifles have always held their own against their Italian competitors, many times at half the price. A further consumer benefit, at least for the present, is that there is somewhat of a price war going on between the official importer, Braztech in Miami, and the licensee for the identical Puma rifles, Legacy Sports in Nevada. Replacement type on many of the similarly outfitted Italian rifles like this one is $1,000 apiece or more. At press time on this ad, by the way, were were in pretty good stock on Winchester .45 Colt Ammunition, 65 cents a round price range. We keep all our ammo listed and current as possible on Guns America.
