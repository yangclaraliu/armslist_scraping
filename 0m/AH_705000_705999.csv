The stock has a few dings on the one side of the handguards from handling. Most are shellac scrapes, but a coupe have gone into the wood. Interestingly, this rifle appears to have some tiger striping in the stock, primarily on the right hand side of the rifle as shown in the pictures.

The bluing on this rifle is typical rearsenal.

The bore is also in excellent shape. I would not call it mint but has revealed excellent, sharp and strong rifling with a light cleaning. It also appears to be a very tight bore.

It has a vz 24 mauser reciever with a 23"" fluted free floated bull barrel with target crown. 3 shot internal magazine and timney trigger. It shoots slightly under 1 moa with remington corelokt ammo and with good match grade ammo like black hills will shoot well under 1 moa(1/2-3/4). Very accurate gun. The gentleman I bought it from had it set up as a benchrest rifle. I put a different stock on it to lighten it up for hunting(benchrest set up was 23lbs.). With said rifle, I took my last buck at 263 yards with a direct heart shot. Needless to say with a 300 win mag he simply fell. I have put a tasco 6-24x40 optic on the rifle for the sale. For your convenience it has been zeroed at 100yds with 150gr rem corelokt. With the rifle purchase I will include my remaining 300 win mag ammo. I have a box of 150gr corelokt and i will toss in as well a bedrock glass bedding kit. I was going to bed it before I tested it and found how accurate it was. After that I didnt want to mess with sub moa accuracy, that was good for me. If you would also like the benchrest stock let me know, but you will have to pay for the additional shipping as it is over 20lbs, unless you pick it up(last picture). Please contact me with any questions."

The M21 is night vision compatible.

This reflex sight offers shooters the ability to acquire targets accurately at any range, in any situation, with both eyes open. It is also designed to work with a magnifier.

Always ready for action – no batteries or switches.
Reflexive, parallax-free aiming with both eyes open and focused on the target.
Self-illumination adjusts to ambient light.
Reticle designed to be visible under all conditions.
Operates under all weather and temperature conditions.
Large 30mm diameter lens with state-of-the-art coatings assures large FOV.

The GB stands for government barrel and is the only factory gun to come with a flash hider and bayonet lug. A GB is easily distinguished by the front sight which is set back from the muzzle as opposed to incorporated at the muzzle end. The flash hider is threaded onto the barrel rather than slid over the muzzle and pinned. The 180 series GB is unique because it has a thinner and sleeker stock and fore end. It also has a roller cam bolt that is much smoother when cycling than the later models and has never failed to eject or feed. 

This gun is in 95% condition and shows some handling wear to the butt plate, rear sight and stock. The barrel and action are clean and in great shape. 

This gun has a long history in Law Enforcement as it began life as a California Department Of Corrections rifle until it was finally sold off. It was then carried as a patrol rifle in a small Kansas Town. 

This is not only a beautiful example of the Mini 14 but is an excellent shooter. I carried this gun as a duty weapon and can make consistent head shots with iron sights at 100 yards. The gun likes the Winchester 55grain FMJ and 55 grain SP

M9-22 STANDARD
The M9 Semiautomatic is a 9x19mm Parabellum pistol that was adopted in 1985 as the ofﬁcial sidearm of the United States military after winning a competition in the 1980s, beating out many other contenders. The 92F survived exposure to temperatures from -40°F to 140°F, being soaked in salt water, being dropped repeatedly on concrete, and being buried in sand, mud and snow. Additionally, the 92F proved a MRBF (mean rounds before failure) of 35,000 rounds, the equivalent to ﬁve or six times the pistol’s service life. It ofﬁcially entered service in 1990. The Chiappa M9-22 is a replica of the US Military sidearm chambered in .22 rimﬁre and is available in two versions, the Standard model featuring ﬁxed front sight and windage adjustable rear sight, and the Tactical model with novak style ﬁber optic sights. The standard model is available with black plastic or wooden grips; the tactical model is supplied with black plastic grips."

1911-22 SEMIAUTOMATIC PISTOL cal.22LR 10 ROUNDS

The original M1911 was a single- action, semiautomaticpistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun."

The gun has been cleaned every time it was fired, and stored in it's case when not in use. It comes from a pet and smoke free home. I have more pictures available if interested (I was limited by the 4MB limit for the posting).

My reason for selling is that my wife and I have just had our first child, and my free time (to go out to the range and put holes in paper for example) has quickly disappeared.

The rifle information can be found here:

http://www.stagarms.com/product_info.php?cPath=13_22&products_id=206

Caliber:     5.56 Nato Chamber
Upper:       Forged and Mil Spec.
Sights:       Midwest Rear Flip Sight/Front Post
Barrel:       16"" Chrome Lined 1/9 Twist
Selector:    Std
Magazine:   30 Round
Stock:        6 Position Collapsible

The rifle comes with the original hard plastic carrying/storage case. I do have two windowed PMAG magazines in addition to the stock magazine. These are, of course, included in this sale.

Also included is a Federal Ammunition ammo case with 100 rounds (5 boxes of 20 rounds) of 5.56 ammunition.

I'll even throw in some shoot n C targets and my yellow chamber flag that I keep in the gun case.

Here are the retail costs:

rifle: $940
ammo + box: $50ish
PMAGs: $36ish

This gun has been well kept, and rarely used. Don't miss out on this like-new rifle. With ammo and targets, this rifle is range-ready at purchase. As always, the Stag Arms warranty is transferable to future owners. 

I'm not interested in trades at the moment. The price is pretty firm, and I take cash only. Call or text me at 8-5-9 5-3-3 2-0-8-9. Thanks for looking."

      IT'S A CALICO M-950 9MM MODEL AND NOT MADE SINCE EARLY '94, THEY CEASED PRODUCTION AS THEY HAD ZERO WAYS TO SELL  THEM DUE TO BAN THERE WAS NO WAY TO PUT A TEN ROUND MAG ON THIS GUN, IT WAS ALSO VERY NOTORIOUS AMONG CRIMINALS DUE TO EASY ABILITY TO CHANGE FIRING/CYCLING RATE AND THE ULTRA RARE ACCESSORY FROM FACTORY A BRASS CATCHER, THESE EJECT THRU BOTTOM INTO A NICE SYNTHETIC BAG, MAKING ANY EVEIDENCE AT CRIMES LACKING, SO THEY MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO NEW MODEL WHEN BAN WAS LIFTED CHANGED TRIGGER SET A LITTLE TO MAKE ANY MANIPULATION MUCH HARDER A VERY GOOD GNSMITH W/KNOWLEDGE WOULD HAVE TO DO IT AND SOMEONE TO BE WILLING TO RISK TEN YRS IN FEDERAL PEN.

           I AM THE ONLY AND ORIGINAL OWNER SINCE '93 AND IT HAS BEEN A SAFE QUEEN SINCE, NEVER FIRED OND IN A HUMIDITY CONTROLLED SAFE OND ONLY PERIODICALLY TAKEN OUT WIPED DOWN AND OILED. EVEN MORE RARE IS THE FACTORY BRASS CATCHER THAT I HAVE YET TO SEE ON ANY OTHER CALICO FOR SALE ON GUNBROKER, OR ANYWHERE FOR THAT MATTER.,SOO MANY OF THESE WEAPONS TURNED UP IN WRONG HANDS DUE TO THE EASE OF CONVERTING THE FIRE OR CYCLING RATE OF THE GUN WHICH WAS EASILY DONE BY AN AMATEUR AND THE BRASS CATCHER MADE THIS A CRIMINALS BEST FRIEND AND HELL FOR THE  ATF, FBI, POLICE. WHO PUT AN END TO THE BRASS CATCHER COMING WITH THE GUN AND WHEN BAN WAS LIFTED MADE SURE THAT THE COMPANY MADE THE TRIGGER SET MORE FOOL PROOF AGAINST THOSE WANTING TO MESS WITH FIRING RATE ALONG WITH RISKING TEN YEARS IN FEDERAL PEN. 
             CALICO STARTED TO MANUFACTURE THEM IN 1999 AND STOPPED IN '04 DUE TO THE BAN OF COURSE. WHEN BAN WAS LIFTED THE LIBERTY III WAS BORN AND ALTHOUGH VERY SIMILIAR BUT DIFFERENT IN WAYS I HAVE STATED, TRIGGER SET AND DOESN'T COME WITH BRASS CATCHER FROM FACTORY.

The PSO-1 was specifically designed for the SVD as a telescopic sight for military designated marksman activities. The current version of the sight is the PSO-1M2. This telescopic sight is different from the original PSO-1 only in that it lacks the now obsolete Infra-Red detector. The metal body of the PSO-1 is made from a magnesium alloy. The PSO-1 features a battery powered red illuminated reticle with light provided by a simple diode bulb. It features professionally ground, fully multi-coated optical elements, a baked enamel finish for scratch protection, and an attached, quick-deployable, extendable sunshade. The scope body is sealed and filled with nitrogen, which prevents fogging of optics and was designed to function within a -50 °C to 50 °C temperature range. Considered the higher end of Soviet military side mount telescopic sights, the quality of the PSO-1 is higher than most other PSO-style telescopic sights. The PSO-1 is the most modern of military tactical scopes with lower power fixed magnification Has the 2"" rubber scope eyepiece for comfortability in long sittings, also has a 2 1/2"" extendable sunshade for daytime use

These AK's go for $200-$300 more than the 7.62's all day, that's if you can find it in this caliber, the scopes are rare as well and are worth $350-$400 in good condition. All markings are in russian all over scope however charger has been changed to U.S type socket. 
 The AK's in great shape, furniture is in good shape no rust, pitting, or marks that would cause this weapon to lose value and has factory target sheet used to sight in scope and test gun at the factory.as well as all the accesories before mentioned.

I did a deal with an individual out west on a really expensive rifle, I sent him the item for trade same day, and he has received a copy of the FFL where the rifle was supposed to be mailed to here in Ohio.

Here is the problem, the FFL that was suppose to ship the rifle to my local FFL gun shop, has failed to do, seems as if he is refusing to do so, he has lied all week, and said he has shipped it, I found out today that everything out of his mouth has been a lie.

The FFL dealer will not answer, or return my calls, I have no idea where the rifle is at, if I'm going to receive it or not, I have threatened at first that I'm calling the local police, and ATF on him, he just laughed, that is what the person I got the rifle from has said.

Now he said that UPS where he ships his firearms out from is only open 1.5 hours per day, BULLSHIT ON THIS LIE.

The FFl holder works for the local Sheriffs dept as an corrections officer, it seems that he is intending on keeping the rifle that actually should belongs to my son, as this is going to him as a Christmas present before he leaves for college, as he will finish up his 2nd year for his associate degree in Criminal Justice program here locally, and then off to Bowling Green to do another two year program in the same program."

Compared to my old surefire 610r the quality is really similar. The H10r housing is EXACTLY THE SAME as the the replica housing. Even the lamps, bulbs, bezel are interchangeable. There two adjustment screws on the housing to tighten up the light on your 1911 as well.
The only difference between the real deal and this clone is the wiring, the led bulb and there is no grip activated switch just an on and off. The slide stop lever included will not work on real 1911's but you can always contact urbanadvantage(s.p.r.s) in WA for extended 1911 slide stops.
The light is made of solid aluminum and does not come with any batteries. It uses cr123 batteries.

I bought this light brand new and did not receive it until after I decided to sell my 1911. It came from overseas so shipping was expensive and took forever. It is unused and in BRAND NEW condition.
Will trade for two chip mccormick power plus 1911 mags.

 * Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
 * The bolt of the VZ 2008stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
 * The VZ 2008 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
 * The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ 2008.
 * The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ 2008.
 * The VZ 2008 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. 
* The alloy magazine of the VZ 58 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lb. vs. .84 lb.)
 * VZ 2008 is easier to field strip.
 * The VZ 2008 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47.

Used lightly, mainly let my daughter plink off a few harmless .22 rds at paper targets. Total Rd ct so far is 125 or so and has been cleaned.
This is the Magpul Original Equipment Edition, or MOE, such manufacturers as Bushmaster also have an MOE edition Rifle or Carbine to offer.
This one comes with everything you see in the pics, as well as the tactical dot scope and the tactical streamline flashlight at the quadrail end. It also has Magpul Flip-up sights which I have seen some gunshops charge over 30$ a piece.

I will say the prices on these tactical .22 is average around $500 used for the M&P 15 .22lr and also the Colt M4 .22lr. However this is the upgraded M&P MOE, so price used it a bit higher.
I have a BNIB Colt M4 .22LR that I don't plan on shooting, I will say as in full use of all functions on the M&P rifle and the barrel is built WAYYYYY better than that of my Colt.
I feel that this M&P 15 .22 is built better and is designed to actual fire thousands upon thousands of flawless rds. This is great for a family, collector, or even the tactical small varmint hunter!, LOL!

M92 PAP Pistol from Zastava

Serbia (Yugoslavia) is known for building some of the highest quality AK variants in the world.  With this PAP pistol, you get an even nicer AK than the PAP rifles, as because this is classified as a handgun by the ATF, 922r is not applicable.

This means you get the pistol exactly as it was put together at the factory in Serbia, without any of the parts swapping bastardization that happens to AK rifles in order to import them into the country.

This is very unique piece, with the flip up hinged dust cover, flip up 200-400m sites, and 2 Yugo bolt hold open magazines.

549,http://www.armslist.com/posts/705549,For Sale:  KIMBER SIS Custom/RL 45 ACP,"East of Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma","$ 1,175","Listed On: Monday, December 17, 2012",Handguns,Kimber                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action,no type,"This is the full size Kimber 45 in the SIS configuration with the built-in tactical rail. I've hung the little Crimson Trace RailMaster laser on it for fun, but I'll keep it if you're not thrilled with it.

Like all SIS's this one is made of stainless steel covered with Kimber's KimPro finish. The slide is machined in the SIS style with a flat top and SIS cocking serrations.  It has the SIS special night sights (with cocking shoulder) so you can always see your gun sights.  The railed frame is checkered, and it has an ambidextrous safety. The gun will come with the Kimber case and two stainless steel 8 rnd magazines (a Kimber KimPro Tac-Mag and a Mec-Gar tactical mag).

This SIS has everything the Kimber Warrior configuration has (except lanyard loop and synthetic grips) and more, being stainless steel.  In fact, if you compare important features, you'd have to go up to Kimber's Gold Combat RL before you beat this SIS.  Add a magwell and grips to this one and you're there.

This gun functions flawlessly, but it is not as pretty as a brand new one. The KimPro finish has taken a couple of scratches (not through to the stainless steel, and with a thin coat of oil, they are almost invisible) and the fancy SIS wood grips are a little beat up. It is a great shooter, but not necessarily one for your pristine SIS collection.

The extra weight of the rail makes this a very easy to steady weapon, so the red laser dot stays where you put it [this in contrast to my little Ultra Carry whose laser dot dances all over the target].  The more I write about this gun, the less I want to sell it, but this is a good time to build up some cash.  If you prefer, I will keep the laser and sell the SIS for $1100.

If this ad is up, the gun is available. No trades thanks, and please let's not start negotiating the price until you see the gun."

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.
