I also have the following ammo for the Revolver...
 68 rounds of UMC 38 Special
 50 rounds of WWB 38 special
 40 rounds of WWB 38 special JHP
 20 rounds of Pow'R'Ball 38 special SD ammo
 40 rounds of WWB 357 magnum JHP
 20 rounds of Pow'R'Ball 357 magnum SD ammo
Thats 178 rounds of 38 special and 60 rounds of 357 Magnum. We all Know that ammo isn't cheap. 
 This is a very nice package so please don't try to lowball me. I don't have to get rid of it. My feelings wouldn't be hurt at all to keep it, I am just looking for a new toy/toys. Please make offers the worst that can happen is that I say ""No thank you."" CCW holders come first, ID a must, Bill of sales preffered. I will ask to see your ID and fully expect you to ask to see mine. Thanks for your time and interest.
 May trade for other handguns, semiauto rifles, a very well dressed HD shotgun plus cash where needed."

This is a crate of Yugoslavian BRASS case 7.62x39 ammunition.  It utilizes the M67 bullet for greater wounding effect, and is loaded hotter than most other standard ammunition in addition to being considerably more accurate. Easier on your extractor than most steel cased ammo.  It comes in a wodden case, and hermetically sealed in a zinc tin.  The ammunition is packed in boxes on SKS chargers, so you get 112 of those along with the ammo. This stuff was manufactured by the SAME factory that is currently producing PRVI Partizan ammunition, so trust me, it's quality.Oh, and it's a lot of fun to open these guys up and smell the history.



The ammo in this configuration has been sold out for some time. I've run through a case before and it's GOOD stuff.  I'm just selling it because of a financial issue. Would prefer cash, but considering picking up a 357 revolver if you want to toss that at me.



Caveat:  Though I've NEVER had an issue with crates of these, I cannot guarantee the ammo as it is hermetically sealed for storage purposes and I have not inspected it.  Sold AS-IS; just like it used to be.



I'm located in Panama City on 98, and can meet in a public place if you would like. Ask me if you want to meet halfway.

MAGNUM RESEARCH INC Desert Eagle Mark VII Pistol 50AE The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating bolt for positive lock-up. The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. Maximum effective range with the standard 6-inch barrel is 200 meters (650 ft.). The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear and enhances the obturation between the bullet and the bore, thus increasing accuracy. Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The combat-type trigger guard is designed for two-handed shooting. The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. When the last round in the magazine is fired, the slide remains in its maximum recoil position, permitting rapid change of magazine and immediate chambering of a round for instant resumption of firing. SPECIFICATIONS: Category: FIREARMS - HANDGUNS Type :Pistol Action :Single Caliber :50 Action Express Barrel Length :6"" Capacity :7 + 1 Safety :Ambidextrous Grips :Black Plastic Sights :Fixe

Just like the description says. I'm selling my S&W 19-5 .357 Mag revolver. It's a 6 shot. It has a Hogue overmold grip and an aftermarket trigger in it that is set at about 1/2-2/3lbs in single action. It's a very light trigger and it is unbelievably accurate. I can put 5 out of 6 shots within an inch easily at 15yds and I'm not a competition shooter by any means. It also comes with the original hard case and a tan leather hip holster and an aftermarket Target Hammer assembly. It only needs the matching Target Trigger assembly to install in the revolver and then it will be an even lighter and smoother pull. Double action is smooth, consistent and crisp. There are some very minor imperfections in the finish but nothing that you would notice unless you really gave the weapon a good lookin' over. I'm also throwing in the original grips plus roughly 50 rnds of .38SPL lead ball ammo by Magtech. 

I can text pictures or any additional information. 
Please feel free to shoot me a text anytime. I will respond as soon as I can. 620-sevenfiveseven-1four6eight  I have to put my number in that sorta format to weed out the bots that like to complicated things and blow up my phone.

the webley is hammerless in name only,since it used an internal hammer, and the H&r lockwork was rather different than the webley, probably as a matter of manufacturing convenience.more obvious is the shaping of the barrel and slide; in the webley pattern the slide is open topped with a bridge carrying the front sight.as a result the barrel is slender so the bridge can pass over it on recoil.
the H&R model uses an open topped slide without a bridge,and the barrel rear section is built up to continue the contours of the slide;there are no rear sights fitted. the external contours of the H&R are more generally radiussed than those of the webley, and the grips are fitted in a different manner.
it was believed that there was little demand for the .25 model and few were made..H&R also produced a .32 model which, while based on webley practice, was not a counterpart of any webley and scott model. it was 'hammerless' ( i.e internal hammer)model with open topped slide and extended barrel, and a short grip safety at the rear of the butt. it also used a coil spring recoil spring above the bolt, instead of the webley v-spring system. this model appeared shortly befor the first world war, and continued to me made into the early 1920's.

Firearm(s) - More specifically an AR-15 variant (.223 preferred), a nice Glock 23/19 (Gen3/4), a Springfield Armory XD40 or XD9 Service or compact. I am an Indiana resident and have a LTCH.

Ammunition! - I'm about to purchase a NIB .40 S&W semi-auto that's going to need some rounds going through it. Prefer mainly 180gr FMJ's, and possibly some 165gr JHP to throw into the mix. Hornady XTP's and Winchester Ranger are preferred on JHP.

I'm trying to avoid spending ANY CA$H on trades, please keep that in mind. But if you've got an AR-15 with enough of the fancy furniture to warrant me spending some cash I'm willing to consider.

Firearm(s) - More specifically an AR-15 variant (.223 preferred), a nice Glock 23/19 (Gen3/4), a Springfield Armory XD40 or XD9 Service or compact. I am an Indiana resident and have a LTCH.

Ammunition! - I'm about to purchase a NIB .40 S&W semi-auto that's going to need some rounds going through it. Prefer mainly 180gr FMJ's, and possibly some 165gr JHP to throw into the mix. Hornady XTP's and Winchester Ranger are preferred on JHP.



And that's all I'm really looking for at this time. I'm not rude and I've got time to answer your questions and offers so send them my way and I'll let you know what I can do. I'm trying to avoid spending ANY CA$H on trades, please keep that in mind. But if you've got an AR-15 with enough of the fancy furniture to warrant me spending some cash I'm willing to consider.

I have bad lighting in my room and I took these with my cell phone.

I have an AR15 with a complete Colt upper receiver and a complete Cavalry arms lower. It shoots good and there is nothing wrong with it. It has the dust cover and the forward assist. I painted it with Krylon paint to give it a cool look. I can paint it completely black if you so desire. 

I am very open to just about any offer. I traded a Glock pistol and I had a gun dealer look at it to tell me what it was worth. He said it was in the 450 to 500 dollar ball park. I don't think I'll sell it for 200 bucks but I'm open to reasonable offers.

The Cavalry arms lower receiver is a MKII and is very lightweight. You won't pick up a lighter AR. When it is fully loaded with two magazines duck taped together it feels like a normal AR.

As always, I can send detailed pictures of whatever you would like to see with my HD camera which shows very good detail.

I do not really want to travel past Columbus, Indiana unless it is a really good trade.

Coagulated blood rusted onto the blade of this piece makes it especially valuable to collectors and dealers.
Comes with a Certificate of Authenticity and an Appraisal - both stating value at $14,500.

The COA (obtained from a historical researcher with over 35 years experience) states ""Your knife with a 6"" blade and 10"" overall length is a manufacture made 'file' knife in the Confederacy. Many file knives of assorted sizes and markings were more common between 1863 and 1865 due to the lack of proper material for production.
The company name, along with CSA and the year of the manufacture (1865) appears undoubtedly authentic. It is rarely seen where the company nae, date and origin is still in tact on a wood handle. ""The knife appears to be well cared for and used but not abused, putting most of the value in the handle itself.
""...It appears that the dark pitting on the blade and handle is from 'blood rust'. Blood rust is the deposit of coagulated blood allowed to remain on the surface causing the irregular pattern of rust pitting from the concentration of salt content in blood.""
Knife comes in a display case with a miniature copy of the appraisal for display, and the full size copy as well as the COA will be sold with the item.
Willing to entertain all cash offers and trade offers for things such as cars, trucks, motorcycles (HD preferred but not limited), land, real estate, gold, electronic lots, GUNS and other items of value, let me know via email, thanks."

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT

The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

If you want to buy the gun with all the stuff from me, its 275 firm.

Brand new the gun on average is 299 plus tax, 20 bucks plus tax for the extra mag and the ammo was round 20 bucks new (ill say around 15 bucks worth now) so this gun is a even trade for most stuff on the list, but if it is something I cant live without I might throw some cash in as well. For now, just email me with offers and I might be able to get some pics loaded up soon as well."
