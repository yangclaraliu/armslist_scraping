   This caliber extends the effective range by several hundred meters.  It has high velocity, much flatter trajectory, better accuracy, and almost NO recoil.  It has a reputation as a much better ""stopper"".  Afgan fighters feared it, and called it the ""Poison bullet"".

This rifle has been in my collection for a long time and the bore was already nearly shot out when it came to my possession. However, at 50 yards one can still hit a man sized target.

I realize you might be able to find this cheaper from a dealer online but most the Yugo M67 on stripper clips is drying up, alot of the cases out there now are 1260 round cases with no stripper clips. Also you have to pay for shipping which can be ridiculous on such a heavy item.

New Remington Pro X-Mark adjustable trigger factory set at 3.5 lbs.

Plus: 
New EGW 20MOA Rail 
Linear Muzzle Brake
Reduced Trigger Sear Spring installed and set

About the Linear Muzzle Brake: I have one installed on my AR and it's puts the muzzle blast away from the shooter to lower noise - not a silencer just changes the direction by pushing the exit gases/noise forward 

Factory trigger sear spring: created a more consistent and lighter pull set at 2.75lbs. It's still fully adjustable, but changing this spring makes a difference in feel (zero creep) on the X-mark Pro trigger. To read more, search for erniethegunsmith on google - he explains much better than I can. 

This gun is setup and ready to go for a 0-1000 yard shooter. It just needs a owner that is looking for tactical and can still be used for hunting.

This Remington 700 AAC 308 is an awesome gun and it's better than new, new condition with the add-on's already installed.  I'm only selling/trading because I want a gun that is a little better for hunting (most likely Stainless and lighter weight).

Purchased used approx one year ago from Kelly's Guns in La Junta, CO.

Gun looks good and has minor swirls/scratches due to being stainless steel.  I have kept it VERY clean and polished and had trigger/spring adjusted.

I have fired approx 100-150 of .38 Special rounds through it and approx 50-75 of .357 rounds through it.  Never a single issue. 

Since it is chambered for .357 it will shoot the smaller .38 round as well, making a great dual purpose revolver.  

.357 = good for small game and bear protection
.38 = better for home defense so you don't go through and out

I bought it for home safety and camping protection after renting one at a range/club in New Mexico that had fired over 10,000 rounds with zero issues.  I have since bought a Saiga that serves my home defense/rifle needs and so am looking to sell this.

Sale includes a like-new handgun safety box with keyed entry.

Will make a copy of your drivers license and copy of bill of sale upon purchase.

Contact me (John) at REDACTED or call me at REDACTED.

I live in La Junta and will travel or meet half way for serious buyers only."

Third Variant (Post-war production, approximately 1920-1923.)  The Model 4 is a relatively simple handgun of blowback design, with a fixed barrel, an external extractor, and a concealed hammer.  Its most unusual feature is that (like its predecessor the Model 3) its extractor and ejection port are on the left.  The barrel acts as a guide for the concentric recoil spring, which is held in place by a bayonette-type lug that covers the front of the barrel, and by a sleeve at the rear which also serves to cover the spring. When the slide moves rearward, it forces the trigger bar down, disconnecting it from the sear.  The safety is a rotating thumb lever that positively locks the cocked hammer.  There is a screw on the backstrap of the grip that regulates the tension of the flat hammer spring. The gun is well-balanced, fits the hand very nicely, and points instinctively.  It is also reasonably accurate.

The Hawke Riflescope Story... 
Europe's Number One Riflescope,
Now Available in the USA!

It's an unfamiliar name to most American hunters, but Hawke riflescopes offer the innovation and quality that American hunters demand. A partnership between a scope marketer, a 3x world champion, and a group of Japanese optical engineers... Hawke has gained a solid reputation in Europe. They own 50% of the scope market in England (UK) and dominate the rest of Europe, too. This article will attempt to explain their amazing success.

Optical Quality 

Hawke's engineers developed a new ""broad band"" lens coating that captures the brightest image without sacrificing clarity and resolution. They call it True-View coating. 
The lenses themselves are individually selected and matched to give edge to edge image clarity. Then during assembly, each lens set is inspected repeatedly to be sure the target image stays crisp and clear through the full range of magnification. 

Mechanical Quality 

""Repeatability"" is critical in riflescopes. Not just the windage and elevation adjustment, but also the point of impact throughout the scope's magnification range. Hawke's innovative reticles and computer programs require their scopes to be repeatable in these areas. So, they developed construction methods and quality control that assures it. Hawke IS Mechanical Quality.

Waterproof, Fog proof, Shock Proof 

The SR reticles themselves are glass etched, which is 10 times stronger than wire reticles, withstands magnum recoil and never fails. Hawke lenses are mounted to withstand recoil from both magnum centerfire and magnum spring airgun rifles... doubly reinforced. They're filled and sealed with DRY nitrogen and o-rings to keep out moisture, retain lens clarity. 


Additional Features 

Hawke riflescopes have a fast focus eyepiece to easily focus the reticle to suit your eye. Positive and repeatable 1/4 MOA windage and elevation is due to precise machining of the mechanism as well as high tensile beryllium erector return springs.

Warranty

Warranty only applies to defects that occur within normal use of the product.
All Hawke products carry a limited lifetime warranty; with the exception of lasers and red dots sights, all of which carry a one (1) year limited warranty.
Warranty includes parts and repair of any factory defect of material or workmanship."

The Grip Pod® System (GPS®) is a revolutionary new vertical foregrip integrated with a strong and stable bipod. The Grip Pod's legs deploy at the push of a button-instantly! It's the ultimate improvement to any weapon system currently employing a vertical grip. Using the Grip Pod® System, the operator can go from a CQB position to a prone-and have a stable base for aimed firing in place before hitting the ground. Say goodbye to cumbersome bipods that have to be manually clipped on or folded into position. And because it's manufactured from aerospace materials it's designed to exceed military specifications for construction and finish, and built tough to withstand hard use."

Rifle is like new, in mint condition!  Very accurate.  26"" barrel with boss.  I have both the Boss adapters: the one with muzzle-break and one without (Boss-CR). Shot very little. Magazine attaches to hinged floorplate.  The rifle has the smooth polished bolt, not the older grooved/fluted bolt.  This is a very fine rifle, manufactured back when Browning was at the climax of its game, i.e. no cheap plastic parts to ""save weight"" on this rifle.  

The only reason I am selling is because the rifle just sits in the safe. I bought this rifle because I had the opportunity to go hunting out west one season.  I got too busy and I never went.  Here in SC, I mostly hunt in the woods, where I use my 270.  I can email pics and am perfectly willing to show a serious buyer the rifle.   I will not sell or trade to an out-of-state citizen, which requires an FFL."

The pistol has a flat blue factory finish. The black plastic hard rubber checkered grips with the Rampant Colt emblem look exactly like those on a large caliber Colt Single Action, and they are in really nice condition. The bore is shiny with good rifling, and trigger pull is smooth. These little Colt revolvers are becoming pretty collectible, and with it’s .22 Magnum chambering, the gun would also be a great pistol for plinking, hunting, and even defense use. No box.
