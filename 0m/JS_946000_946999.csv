It is a brand new, never assembled Armalite complete lower receiver assembly with collapsible stock (pinned by the dealer to be NY compliant) with six 20-round Armalite mags. The magazines are New York State compliant also, because they are brand new pre-ban mags direct from Armalite. They are the original M-14 based mags. They are definitely not Gen 2. The mags are also brand new in the original packaging.

The complete upper receiver assembly can be purchased direct from Armalite or a 3rd party to complete the rifle, which does not require going through an FFL. This lower is 100% Armalite, quality forged 7075-T73 aluminum, complete, fully assembled, and ready for your choice of Armalite platform compatible upper assemblies: including Armalite, Noveske N6 and Aero SPR-2. 

I bought these items a couple years ago because they were the components most vulnerable to future bans, and I wanted to be “grandfathered in”.

I purchased the lower from one of the largest dealers and police suppliers in Upstate New York. They ordered in the lower direct from Armalite, and their in-house gunsmith pinned the stock which makes it NY legal. Legal for now, at least. It's up to you to make sure you are compliant with future NY laws, or ship it or sell it out of state.

Spike's Tactical .22lr conversion kit includes the .22lr bolt and one Black Dog 26rd Smoke magazine. Some unique features not found in any other current conversion kits include: O rings on the chamber adapter to keep the bolt centered in the .223 or 5.56 chamber and to increase the back pressure by sealing the adapter and not allowing so much carbon and gases to blow back, it also comes with a solid plug to take the place of your gas tube for those of you who shoot a lot or want to dedicate your 2.23 or 5.56 upper to .22lr. Of course, these will come with the electroless nickel finish that is on our current dedicated .22lr bolt. The auto trip kit is for those of you who currently have an M16 lower and would like to use this bolt in full auto. (It DOES NOT make your semi auto lower run full auto, it only enables the bolt to work on a full auto lower). We test fire and tune all of the conversions in house but some of the conversions may require tuning for your setup, un-notched hammers also work best with them.

The belt measures 3"" wide, and its 46"" from the buckle to the center of the piece with the adjustment holes. It is VERY well made. It weight 2.5 pounds, to try and give you an idea of how heavy the leather is. The cartridge loops fit .38 Special rounds. The stitching is perfect, hardware clean and shiny and nicely embellished. The holster is a straight drop and appears to be for a 6"" barrel. Made by Bernie Roo. There is some darkening of the leather in spots but thats all. No cuts, no cracks, no physical imperfections of any kind. With proper care I'm sure it would render a lifetime of service.
I was told by two different SASS guys that a new one like this would cost $200 +, and I have no trouble believing that. I may not know Cowboy stuff but I know a bit about holsters and leather as well and this is a sweet unit!

9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

Features a Nitron®-coated stainless steel slide over a dark hard anodized alloy frame. Hogue® Rubber Grips round out this package.

This rifle is amazingly light, easy to handle, and can put 30 rounds under a nickle at 100 yards!!

It comes with over 7500 rounds of ammo.  5000 of which are the highly sought after Winchester dynapoint heavy hollow points, which this rifle shoots amazingly well.

The base rifle, and parts to upgrade including scope cost almost $2000 alone over 2 years ago.  This rifle has had less than 200 rounds shot out of it since built.  I built it to use around the farm, and I generally just carry my pistol because it is easier to carry and do farm work!"

It's built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. They are proportionate in size to the center fire version's magazine to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine.

This rifle has only been shot about 200 times so it's not even broken in yet!  The gas-piston makes it run really smooth and without any recoil and keeps the receiver clean.  The whole system is extremely balanced and easy to shoot well and would be ideal for any age shooter or of any level, including competitions.  The only scratches are extremely small on the lowers retaining pins.  Get it while you can because it will go fast."

When clamped down there is no play AT ALL. Also has a built in quick disconnect. The greatest feature of all is the weight 7.1 oz. A comparable stock (Magpul CTR) weighs in at 9.2 oz. I have both and the Rogers fit is tighter than the Magpul. I bought this one then a buddy of mine gave me a stock for free. So, I'm selling this for what I paid for it to avoid shipping it back.

I will leave ad up for ""GOUGERS"" to see. I'll update as I get more!

I am also working on ammo. Im tired of guys buying from Walmart then trying to resell for 3 times the cost. 

Sorry I can't do a ""waiting list"" but will resend when my next order arrives. I am expecting similar models and quantities. Possible a couple centry underfolder, AK's as well."

This model is common to jam, I've learned that this gun does jam if the magazine is packed full & if I leave 1-2 bullets out of the Mag it'll work just fine.  If you are looking for personal defense, I wouldnt recommend, however if you want a $160.00 play & have inexpensive fun blasting it at the range it's well worth the cash...

Firm on the price, as it's just not worth my time to meet & sell. I just dont use it anymore & I need to clear out my unused stuff

I believe in full disclosure, so: There is a small takedown mark that lives almost completely under the slidestop. The original Colt slidestop had an imperfection on the flat underside that must have rubbed. So it's not actually from takedown--just from the movement of the original slidestop when running. The bluing job is so stunningly good that I would never have the gun refinished just because of that, but there you have it.

The extractor and slidestop are EGW HD. The trigger guts are STI, while the trigger is a Greider. The screw slots are correctly lined up.

The bluing is astonishing. Phil is essentially the grandmaster of bluing and is getting out of the business.

This Colt runs great and has barely been shot. You could pretty much eat dinner off of it. The trigger is absolutely unbelievable, and I've had some good triggers in my time. The checkering was done completely by hand, which is pretty much a lost art these days. Same for the ejection-port relief, which is probably my favorite little detail about the Colt. It's got style to spare.

It will come in the original nice Colt blue box with both Colt mags, all the factory stuff, and a spare set of wood medallion grips. I even have the white packing box into which the blue collector box fits.

The price is $1800. DROPPED TO $1750. You do the math. Shipping straight from me to your FFL is $50. Or I'm more than happy to do a local sale in Denver/Boulder/Lakewood and points nearby. Only possible partial trades would be a Mossy 590, Rem 870P/Wingmaster, or FNS-9. Thanks for looking!"

One of the finest AR-15 / M16 mags on the market today. Extremely reliable and durable and at a great price. By collecting input from military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters, TAPCO has designed a magazine that can be depended on from a trip to the firing range to deployment overseas. Molded of reinforced composite with aggressive horizontal ridges that provide increased gripping surface for insertion and extraction of the magazine in wet or muddy conditions. This also helps to eliminate feed lip separation. The anti tilt follower has been designed to allow more dirt and grime to pass than any other magazine on the market. This allows the magazine to keep feeding ammo, despite loose dirt or sand that may have entered the magazine. The spring is made using a 1770 Stainless steel wire, featuring a unique shape for smoother, quieter loading through all 30 rounds. It also reduces overall stress on the magazine body, preventing spine cracks. 30 Round capacity. Fits All AR15, M4, and M16 Variants. Made in the U.S.A. with a lifetime warranty from TAPCO."

The 4 Inch XD combines safety with quality and ease of use.
With the new Ultra Safety Assurance (U.S.A.) action trigger system, this polymer framed pistol is as comfortable as it is safe.
The XD''s frame is made from a proprietary polymer material that has produced a pistol that is extremely durable, reliable and lighter than popular competitive models.
The frame is checkered in front and rear for a more positive grip, even with wet or sweaty hands. The XD''s also have a slide release, ambidextrous magazine release button, and a quick turn disassembly lever, allowing for amazingly fast and simple field-stripping."
