It is an older version of one that I had from the 1960's, this one dates around the 30's. It is in fair to good condition, and I had a very reputable gunsmith look it over. It will need a detailed cleaning and if someone is so inclined, they could restore it. It is in shooting condition, however I have never shot it. It is valued between $450 and $550. 

I am not a big antique firearms guy, so I just want to let somebody who is  the chance to take care of it and clean it up. 

I will sell it for $500 obo or trade for a handgun. 

Pics will be up sometime this week.

Please remember I did do the research and put the time in to find out about these shotguns, and I do know that it is a fairly desired item. I am open to offers but don't come up with something 100 or + less then what I'm asking. I had the shotgun valued by a smith that I use exclusively and trust.

Winchester is no longer the Winchester we came to know for so many years anymore, and these shotguns are climbing in price due to this."

It is a rather uncommon piece known as the MANTIS 140 XLR.  It is comparable to the PVS-14 but the IR laser is 100 mw which is extremely powerful.  The laser has an adjustable focus, but the threads are a little gummed up so it sticks before it focuses all the way back to the laser point, but I have decided not to worry about cleaning the threads simply because an IR laser of that power can be a little dangerous.  Instead it makes a fantastic IR illumination device that can light up a hill side several hundred yards away.  When focused, the laser is supposed to be visible out to 10 kilometers.

The monocular has in integral weapons mount and mounts right behind my IR capable EOTech, however, I have never actually fired the gun with it mounted in this fashion.  Instead I just use it handheld.  When the laser can be focused down it is actually adjustable for point of aim, however, to use it effectively in this manner it would take a pressure switch that is rather hard to come by.

The price is meant to reflect the going rate for a PVS-14 plus a mil-spec 100 mw IR laser, however, that is just a starting point."

If you are looking for this, you probably know what it is, but just in case here is a brief explanation.  Basically, instead of using special photo sensitive films it uses a chip like a digital camera and enhances the picture to allow you to see in the dark.  The big benefit that this provides is the ability to be used during the day without damaging anything.  It also has some other features that make it pretty entertaining like the fact that it has a video out so you can record your night hunts.  Just check youtube for hog hunts and you will see what I mean.  It also has a nifty feature called one-shot-zero.  Basically, it allows you to zero it on your rifle with a single shot.  Simply mount it to the rifle, aim at a single point and take a shot.  Next, activate the zero function and while holding the cross hairs on the initial point of aim you use the buttons to move a floating x over the point of impact and voila!  Your scope is now zeroed after a single shot.  This also means that if you record how far off mechanical zero each of your rifles is, you can transfer it between them and just adjust accordingly, so one shot from each rifle and you can swap out at will.

Listings that state $1 means that there will be haggling involved and realistically there will be many low ball offers for you to sift through. Putting a price on your listing at least let's people know what you expect even if you are willing to negotiate. People come on Armslist expect to barter some but stay reasonable in expectations.

Second, check your grammar. This is not English class but if you use ""whatcha got"" and other cute phrases like that you send a very non-professional message and honestly I would prefer to do business with a more professional seller.

This is not meant to be rude or condescending but rather some friendly advice to help you generate more sales and keep Armslist as professional as possible.

Wishing you the best Armslist experience possible.

You can flag this if you want, and you probably will, but it is still good advice and will help you sell more items in the long run. If you agree with what I have said and it makes sense, then please let it stay up for others to learn from. 

Thank you and Merry Christmas!"

WE PETITION THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO:
We ask President Obama to support law abiding gun owners in this time of tragedy.
We ask President Obama to stand with law abiding gun owners in this time of tragedy. Guns laws could not have prevented Adam Lanza from killing 27 innocents. The real question is what made this disturbed young man into a murderer of children. Where is the outrage at the violent video games he played? A piece of plastic and steel doesn't have a will Mr. President. Evil is not law abiding, and Adam Lanza stole those guns after failing to buy one legally. it is America's law abiding gun owners who would have died with Victoria Soto and Dawn Hochsprung defending the children with only our bodies on December 14th, because it was already illegal to bring a gun into that school. Please don't pander to the politics Mr. President. A feeding frenzy of new gun legislation is not the answer."

OVERVIEW:
When our triangular barrel contour made its debut in varmint/target weight on the Model 700™ VTR, it was deemed one of the most innovative barrel designs conceived. We’re proud to unveil its big-game evolution, the Model 700 XHR (Xtreme Hunting Rifle), firmly seated atop the food chain with the renowned accuracy and supreme strength of our Model 700 action as its foundation. Pick it up, and the first thing you’ll notice is the impeccable balance. With a magnum contour barrel crafted in our patent-pending triangular formation, the rifle seems to point itself. This barrel design allows us to shave weight while maintaining the rigidity of a traditional round barrel. And the weight that remains is in all the right places. Plus, its surface area facilitates rapid cooling for more accurate followup shots. Not that you’ll need them. Like all new Model 700s, the XHR features our new externally adjustable X-Mark Pro® trigger system that comes set from the factory with 3 1/2 lbs. pull, and can be easily fine-tuned to your preference – by you.Its cutting-edge performance and looks don’t stop at the barrel. The Realtree® AP™ HD™ camo synthetic stock is equipped with patented Hogue overmolding accents at the grip and fore-end areas for comfort and a firm hold in adverse conditions. Then we added the world’s most effective recoil pad – SuperCell – that reduces rifle kick to a gentle push. The barrel and action are finished in durable satin black oxide. A hinged floorplate magazine and jeweled bolt round out the impressive list of features. Gain the ultimate lethal advantage with the new Model 700 XHR.
KEY FEATURES:
•	Patent-pending 24"" triangular barrel in magnum contour 
•	X-Mark Pro Adjustable Trigger system 
•	Rugged synthetic stock in Realtree® AP™ HD™ camo 
•	Hogue® overmolded accents on grip and fore-end 
•	Extremely durable satin black oxide metal finish 
•	Polished blue jeweled bolt 
•	Hinged floorplate 
•	Patented SuperCell™ recoil pad

Scope:
Feature for feature, stunning Euro Diamond™ Rifle Scopes deliver optical performance virtually identical to higher priced, ultra-premium scopes. Engineered with a proprietary light management system, precision-ground optical glass, Euro Diamonds provide a level of sharpness well beyond what the human eye can process. 
When matched head-to-head under real-world conditions - lousy light, bad weather - Euro Diamond scopes flat outperform high-end scopes costing hundreds of dollars more.
Euro Diamonds get a boost in optical performance from proprietary, ultra-sharp, ultra-bright and glare-free HiLume multi-coating. It’s got all the proofs - waterproof, fogproof and shockproof. Factor in internal focusing, ergonomic adjustments, up to 4” of eye relief, a 4:1 magnification range, an expansive field-of-view, and it’s clear Euro Diamonds have everything it takes to elevate your shooting to the next level.

For sale is what you see in the picture which is a Browing Hi-Power (aka P-35) made under contract from Fabrique Nationale, Belgium by John Inglis in Canada, a reproduction board shoulder stock and a 1953 Canadian holster, lanyard and two clips.  Inglis reportedly (The Browning Hi-Power Automatic Pistol book) made 151,816 of these in the Mark I and Mark II patterns.  Approximately 50,000 Mark 1's as this is, were made under what is called the Chinese contract, however few if any went to the Chinese because of WWII demand for side arms.  The Mark I's are differentiated from the Mark II's by the slotted grip to accept a shoulder stock and the adjustable tangent sight versus the driftable only blade sight.  The Mark I's are said to be in the most demand.  You should understand that ATFE says that only the original stock that looks like the ones used with C-96 Mauser (aka broomhandle) is legal to attach to the pistol.  All reproductions are not.

I think my Chinese contract Inglis (it has CH in the serial number) has been refinished by the seller, Pacific International (their ad said “absolutely original and unaltered,” but didn't say not refinished) because my readings indicate that they were finished in a black lacquer (carcinogenic by the way) or parkerized and mine looks blued and parkerized.  And I see buffing lines on the slide with the Mark I * is gone except for the asterisk (*).  Bore is shiny and good and the serial number is on all the parts (aka matching serial numbers) The original clip has the II that looks like a T with two legs indicating its original and the other is aftermarket I bought.  Due to the pixel limit I can send you all the pix you want if interested."

These were made for a short time, it is an officers size frame with a commander length slide. Here is a gun with all the attention to details of a Wilson Combat but at half the price. It has been polished to a high shine along the side of the slide as well as the thumb safe, slide release, magazine release, and through pins. The rest is a matte silver bead blast texture. This is an early Kimber series I, before the external extractors and cheapened internals that have sadly become standard in the more mass produced Kimbers. This is an all Stainless gun, no aluminum alloy frame. It has the Kimber low profile sights, they have been perfectly adjusted, by drifting and milling, for elevation and windage at 20 yards. The original plastic mainspring housing has been replaced with a stainless Wilson Combat 20 LPI housing. The Grip safety has been fitted with an Ed Brown memory grip beavertail safety, precision installed and mounted to allow your hand to grip as high as possible to the bore centerline. The thumb safe is also an Ed Brown, it is an extended tactical safety that angles slightly downward to allow more ergonomic handling. The trigger is a Kimber match grade with adjustable overtravel screw. The guide rod bushing is new in the last 200 rounds, as is the recoil spring. I have a new pack of 3 recoil springs and the original guide rod bushing as replacements too. Grips are Kimber custom green laminate with diamond checkering. Trigger is set to break clean at 3.5 pounds, very little creep or overtravel. This is a very light trigger and may surprise even a trained 1911 shooter, but it can be easily brought back to 5 or so pounds by replacing the sear spring at about $4 from Midway. Galco carry holster is practically unused, the outside waist band holster is in good shape and well worn in, the magazine pouch is also in great shape, all leather is Galco. It comes with the take down tool, users manual, original plastic box, as well as the shammy and embroidered Kimber gray carry case which fits the gun and a magazine perfectly. Absolutely beautiful gun, as aesthetically attractive as it is functional. Give me a call or email if interested, text doesn't work. Thanks."

The New DPX Scope Saver (patent pending) found exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, this new addition aces the optics mounted on your long guns inside the space in the door. The Scope Saver protects scoped firearms from adjacent firearms and other contents in the safe, ensuring that time spent sighting-in isn’t wasted. In addition, the space that would be taken up by a scope in a traditional safe is now freed up for another firearm. While other safes will store your guns, no other safe will protect them and keep them ready for you to use like a Browning ProSteel Safe.

AXIS Adjustable Shelving — The Most Versatile Safe Interior Ever Designed. Period.
Browning ProSteel safes lead the industry when it comes to managing safe interior storage. Nowhere is our expertise more evident than with our innovative Axis Adjustable Shelving (patent pending). Unlike shelves in other safes that are either fixed in position or only offer vertical adjustment, Axis shelves can be adjusted, both vertically and horizontally, to accommodate items over a broad range of sizes while working around long guns. All premium Browning ProSteel safes feature the Axis Adjustable Shelving system. Platinum Plus and Gold Series safes come fully loaded with an all shelf interior that can be customized to meet your needs. Check out a Browning ProSteel safe with Axis Adjustable Shelving and imagine the treasures you could fill one with.
