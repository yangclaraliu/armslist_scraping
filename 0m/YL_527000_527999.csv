I have for sale a really nice .22 target pistol that is considered by some to be the most accurate .22 rim-fire pistol ever produced.  This one shoots very nice, and has the following features:
Adjustable Trigger
Adjustable Target Sights
Thick Checkered Walnut Target Grips
Vent Rib with accommodation for optics
Barrel Weight for perfect Balance
Textured Front and Back Strap
Two magazines (both factory I believe)
Original Box and all Paperwork
2 boxes of subsonic Remington LR ammo

These guns were used as target pistols by the military because they are designed with the same weight, feel, and grip angle as a standard 1911 (with a little less recoil!).  I would consider this pistol to be in 90-95%, with the only flaw being a blemish in the bluing on the left side of the barrel (as seen in second pic).  The blemished is only bluing deep. 

The pistol shoots great, and is VERY accurate.

I have a gun safe that works well, and will hold quite a few long guns and pistols.  It is 21"" wide, 16"" deep and just over 59"" tall.  The front door is stainless, and the electronic lock can be reprogrammed to whatever you want.  It has a fire rating, and the inside has one shelf and is covered in carpet.  The door is heavy-duty, with 5 live-locking pins on the side, top and bottom.  

The paint is scuffed and scratched here and there, and the door looks good from several feet away, but up close you can see the clear-coat over the stainless door is discolored.  I think it could be just removed and the door polished (or you could just put the safe in a closet!).  The electronic lock works great.

The price is 1/2 the price of a new one, and is therefore firm.  I have a lift gate and can load it into your truck or van.  I probably weighs 300 pounds or so; one person with a nice dolly can handle it pretty easily.

Model 700 XHR (Xtreme Hunting Rifle), firmly seated atop the food chain with the renowned accuracy and supreme strength of our Model 700 action as its foundation. Pick it up, and the first thing you’ll notice is the impeccable balance. With a magnum contour barrel crafted in our patent-pending triangular formation, the rifle seems to point itself. This barrel design allows us to shave weight while maintaining the rigidity of a traditional round barrel. And the weight that remains is in all the right places. Plus, its surface area facilitates rapid cooling for more accurate followup shots. Not that you’ll need them. Like all new Model 700s, the XHR features our new externally adjustable X-Mark Pro® trigger system that comes set from the factory with 3 1/2 lbs. pull, and can be easily fine-tuned to your preference – by you.

This rifle is in like new condition with approximately 400 rounds fired. It's been super reliable and is plenty accurate. Frankly, it's too nice looking for my needs. I've babied it which is why it looks like new.

The scope shown is a Center Point 4-16X40. This scope is high on features and not too bad on quality. It's no Leupold, but it works. It has red/green illuminated reticle with 5 levels of brightness each. It's a 4 to 16x zoom and has adjustable parallax from 5 yards to infinity.

Price with scope - $ 390
Price without scope - $350

Included is the original box, manual, lock, factory 10 round box magazine and a nylon and neoprene sling.

Description: The Millennium PRO compact polymer frame pistol is the 3rd generation of the Taurus series. Offering improved ergonomics and performance, the new design features enhanced finger indexing Memory Pads, Posi-Traction slide serrations and recessed magazine release, all weighing in at a mere 23.5 ounces. Ten rounds in the magazine, one in the chamber, and the lightweight frame makes this lifesaver a must for law enforcement and anyone concerned about personal safety. It's combination single action / double action trigger automatically changes from single to double if a round does not fire. Having to recock to weapon after a misfire is not necessary unless there is a second misfire. The Taurus Millennium PRO is available with either a Blue or Stainless Steel slide. The Millennium PRO carries three safety features including the manual safety lever, trigger block mechanism and a firing pin block. The Taurus Security System is included at no extra charge for that added peace of mind.

These display stands are machined out of aircraft-grade aluminum, and polished to a fine luster to compliment your firearms, not detract from them!  Since they are aluminum, they are softer than stainless steel, and won’t damage your weapon’s finish!

It has a Boyds stock with a 11 round cheek rest with pouch, customer bent bolt with back ear for easy cocking(the original bolt will be included that has the gun mach serial number), is drilled and tapped so it not using the cheap aftermarket pickatiny rail that is installed over the old iron sights(iron sights will be included yet useless due to muzzle modification, muzzle was threaded and fitted for 1/2x28 for an actual suppressor, right now has a muzzle break that is an additional 5in over the length of the barrel, barska scope that actually supports the vibration and recoil of the gun, and a haris bypod. The gun shoots 3 rounds (match grade bullets) in quarter’s size at 50 yards! I’m asking for $780, that is what I invested in it, yet I’m fairly flexible if we come to an agreement for sale. I can trade it for ar rifles(no dpms, unless is in 308), colt 1911(.45) or a Romanian dragunov psl.

It has the much sought after 3"" barrel which makes a good combination of accuracy and compactness.  Comes with very comfortable Hogue Bantam grips with exposed backstrap.

Up for sale or trade, is a combo of a DPMS Model A-15 AR and Kimber Classic Custom. I am willing to sell either separately. Description of each weapon and features are as follow.

The DPMS AR is .223/5.56 Model A-15 rifle. It was bought brand new years ago and has only had 300 rounds through her. It is in great used shape with minimal cosmetic blemishes. It features a 16"" barrel with a great deal of accessories. I upgraded the carbine length hand guard to a Knights Armament RAS rail, with KAC rail covers. I have installed a Magpul ACS stock and Magpul MOE pistol grip. The back up sights are also Magpul. There is a Grip Pod bipod vertical foregrip, Laserlyte K-15 laser sighting system. Eotech 512 A65 Holographic weapon sight. Magpul ASAP sling adaptor with Magpul MS2 FDE one/two point sling. After market gas block from brownells. Promag Tactical latch installed on stock DPMS charging handle. The rifle also comes with five 30 round and three 20 round PMAG(s).

As far as the Kimber goes, the model is a Classic Custom in all black. I've put around 84 rounds through it. She is a very smooth and accurate .45. It is true, though, what they say about Kimber 1911s, they are picky with 1911 magazines. She likes the Kimber magazines my dad has, but not my colt 1911 magazines.

The tactical chassis series is a combination of benchrest accuracy, superior ergonomics and specialized design. The new TAC21 chassis brings the Remington 700 Short Action to the next level in versatility and modularity, with an instant improvement in accuracy.

The drop-in chassis serves as a base to which the operator can add tactical components according to the desired functionality. The stock is manufactured out of aluminum hard anodized to mil spec type III, with a top full length MIL-STN-1913 accessories mounting rail. The built-in mounting rail has 20 MOA (Minutes of Angle) on the action housing and is parallel to the barrel axis on the fore-end.


When ordering the TAC21 understand its customizable and fits smoothly with your tastes in weapon accessories. The TAC 21 chassis is designed to accept any AR-15 butt-stock and pistol grip. The basic kit does not include shoulder butt-stock and pistol grip, offering the option to customize from the wide variety available on the market.

The TAC21 chassis uses AICS style magazine in .223 and .308 caliber, and supports installation of bolt on MIL-STN-1913 accessory mounting rails on the fore-end and side of the action housing. Mounting holes are spaced for Magpul style L5 (11 slots) and L3 (7 slots) rails (1.600” / 3.200”).

TAC21 chassis is engineered to minimize warping and distortion. The rifle receiver only makes contact with the TAC21 chassis on the V shape bedding and recoil lug area insuring the best accuracy and repeatability. The generous clearance on the fore-end makes any barrel (diameter up to the receiver size – 1.350”), free floating.
