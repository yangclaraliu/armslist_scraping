Figured I would throw this out there since I just put it on Craigslist too.  This thing is bad-to-the-bone...and I should NOT be selling it prior to the the Superbowl.  I'll probably hate myself if it sells before then.  You have to come see this in person to believe it, some serious wow factor.  Jaws drop whenever someone comes to my house and it's on.

Only a few months old and less than 100 hours on the lamp (good for 4000 hours).  25ft (yes, FEET) screen in HD...doesn't get any better, just be warned you won't want to look at another regular TV again...and you WILL be having the Superbowl party at your place!!

Over the years i've shot many different guns of all sorts, and found the AR-15 to be one of my favorite. Unfortunately this is the worst time ever to buy the most common assault rifle because it seems the entire country is looking to buy one, two, three of them. I can't afford the overly inflated prices, and have found a decent site that will supply the rest of the gun for reasonable.

The only part left is the lower, which of course is sold out everywhere. So i'm turning to you guys. Someone, please sell me your spare lower for a reasonable price! I am a responsible adult, looking to not just go out and buy a gun to protect myself, but rather to learn about the gun, study the gun, build it from the ground up and then protect myself. Since this is my first firearm, it would mean more to me to build it so i know how to properly care for it BEFORE i take it to the range. 

I have many non/gun related trades i can offer if that might interest you. I have loads of current electronics valued at much more then any lower for sale on the market right now. I have a ton of brand new iphones for any carrier, a brand new PS Vita, a couple ipods, and of course cash if youd rather just have that.

I will also consider decent brand ak47's, or other .223/.556 or 7.62 caliber rifles. They can be heavily used, i'm fine with swapping out parts. I just need something that isn't going to cost me 5X what it's normally sold for. If you don't have a lower for sale, but know of a site or person selling one, feel free to contact me with their info or even provide suggestions to alternatives. I've shot plenty of guns, but i am FARRRR from an expert.

I have shot many in my lifetime, but just recently decided to purchase one. I've always been drawn to the 1911, it feels good, shoots good, and i've naturally been a pretty good shot with one so that's what i would like to buy. I realize these are a more expensive model handgun, but i was hoping to find a nice RIA for reasonable, preferably the tactical model, but really as long as it's full size i will consider it. This handgun is not being purchased to be carrier around, it will remain in my house strictly for home defense (praying i never have to defend my home). Later on down the road when i decide to get my conceal and carry, i'll find a compact, but for now i would like a full size. Preferably not the 9mm model, i just wouldn't feel right buying a 9mm 1911 for my first gun.

I may also consider a full size glock 23, or another full-size .40 or larger handgun. I'm not overly picky, but i need something halfway reliable. Not a big Taurus fan, but honestly, the first good offer i get, i will take! 

I have plenty of cash on hand, although not looking to spend over 600-700. Also have some brand new iPhone 5's, 4S', and other cell phones/electronics i would be willing to trade if that interests you!

I have up for sale my Custom Build AR-15. It is chambered to accept both 5.56 & .223 ammunition.   I had the rifle build for me by a mater gunsmith and range master here in MN.  I have decided to sell so I can put the money towards buying a new home.  The weapon has had 297 Rounds fired through it (3 Miss Fires Only, ZERO FTE , or FTF Malfunctions) and I use only brass ammo none of that Russian crap in my AR’s!  It shoots great and it spot on! 

Here is what I have to sell:

The Weapon System – It is a Wilson Combat Upper, 16in Barrel, Mid-Length Gas System, Free Floating Daniel Defense Quad Rail, CMMG Lower, BAD Lever, Wilson Combat Tactical Charging Handel, Mil-Spec Buffer Tube, 2 Stage Trigger, TROY Aluminum Rear Flip Site,  Chrome Bolt Carrier Group, and Titanium Bolt…. To put it simply “High Quality from Top Manufacturers” 

Accessories – I have a Primary Arms Optic and Magnifier, Vertical Grip Bi-Pod, (6) Total PMags all with Ranger Plates, Rail Guards,  Wilson Combat Single Point Sling and Mount,  Ergo Grip, Magpul Stock, and a Formed Pelican Case

Ammo – I also want to sell the ammo I have as this is the last 5.56 rifle I own.  I have 900+ Rounds of Fiocci, PMC, and Remington New Brass Ammo in 20 & 50 Round Boxes.  
I would prefer to sell the items to one single buyer as a package. With that said; if I sell the rifle only first then the accessories will follow.  If you buy the you will get a much better deal!  

Total for everything $3700 CASH ONLY Face to Face, OBO (Items will be removed for ANY offer) 

 NO PayPal or Shipping so please do not ask. I would be willing to send the rifle to an FFL after payment if you are not a local buyer, or if you are close to MN I would be willing to make a small trip. I don’t mind driving..  

Please Call, Text, or Email Me…. My name is Anthony you can reach me at REDACTED. Thank You for Looking and Have a Great Day!"

Introduced in 1912 by the British company of Holland & Holland, the .375 caliber soon became one of the deadliest calibers in existence for versatility, reliability, accuracy and stopping power.
It is possible that the .375 Holland & Holland Magnum formerly know as the Nitro Express is the greatest rifle caliber of all time. Many suggest that it is perhaps too big and too powerful, maybe even a case of overkill, but when you are hunting big game or taking long distance shots then you need all the power and accuracy possible for that clean kill or bulls-eye shot...and the .375 H&H Magnum can deliver both.

The .375 H&H will drop a deer dead on it feet and not smash up the meat any more than say a .270 or .300 caliber would. Furthermore the .375H&H Magnum has been the undisputed champion for bagging dangerous game right the way up to cape Buffalo and elephant with a single shot kill.
Be it moose, big bear or elk the .375H&H Magnum can be depended on where other calibers may slacken off to a 2 round kill, the second round being more of a coupe d' grace shot on the downed, stricken and alive game.

The .375 H&H Magnum delivers a super flat trajectory over and beyond 300 meters  and delivers a knockout punch like comparing Mike Tyson to a middleweight."

For sale is a Llama Max-1 L/F in .45acp with 5 1/2"" barrel and nice black rubber 
(neoprene) LLAMA grips. It is marked Gabilondo Y Cia Vitoria (Espana) on the right 
side. It is in excellent condition, and comes with one 7 round magazine, original box, and original manual . Has fixed 3 dot combat sights and skeleton hammer. All parts are factory original to this gun, with the exception of the magazine, which is an unmarked, standard 7 round 1911 magazine (original Llama magazine was lost at some point, but this replacement has worked flawlessly in this gun).
Just beginning to show early signs of very light holster wear on the high 
points. Finish wear is VERY light and difficult to see (and photograph), and there are a few VERY small scuffs/marks in the finish here and there, but they are very shallow and minor, and only affect the finish, and have not scrated into the metal at all. They are VERY hard to get to appear in photos, so they may or may not be visible. The difficulty in seeing them in photos does attest to how shallow/minor the matks are though. 
Comes with original box and manual. Bore is in excellent condition, and although I Haven’t kept count, it has likely only fired between 200-300 rounds. 
Good shooter, comfortable grips (the Neoprene grips are very good about 
preventing slipping in the hand when wearing gloves, or hands are wet or sweaty). 
Mechanically great, and has had no feeding/firing issues of any kind with multiple 
types/brands of ammo, and several different 7 and 8 round 1911 magazines.

I bought this a while back ago just wanting a stainless 10/22. Unfortunately no one had a standard stainless model in stock so ended up buying this one which was considerably more.

This is one of those you need to see in person as it has many higher quality features that the standard 10/22's do not. 

I later found out that this was a limited run and was highly desirable so I left it as it came from the factory and never fired it. It has remained in a dehumidified safe for the past year and a half

I have a few items I am looking to trade for and may consider others.

I can add cash if my trade is not sufficient or you may add cash if vice-verse.

I am looking to sell for $500 cash or trade value around six. 

Trades I am looking for currently are......

Springfield armory XD 40dt duo tone stainless slide
DPMS oracle upper or other upper with gas block that has the rail. BCG wouls be nice but not a deal breaker
Smith and Wesson 300 aac blackout upper or possibly others with BCG
Para Ordnance p-14 1911 double stack 45 acp or similar stainless preferred.

As stated, I may consider other trades but it would need to be worth my while if it is not on the list above.

Once again I can always add cash for the right item(s) if needed.

I will only ship to a dealer with a FFL and you or the dealer will need to send me a copy of the FFL

The 7.62 round is a good choice as this is currently one of the cheaper to shoot and deliver a lot more punch than the 5.56 or 5.45 rounds. This gun has a side folding stock. . Overall finish is great but the grips are original .Function is perfect as you would expect with an AK. i will guarantee your satisfaction with this gun - the buyer will have a 3 day money back inspection period after this is received by your ffl.

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

THIS GUN IS LITERALLY NEW IN THE BOX.  I picked it up Saturday.  I had been looking for an M&P Pro 9mm and finally just ordered the standard model.  Between the time I ordered it and it arriving I found an M&P pro and bought it.  I just got this gun from BUDSGUNS for $549 +$20 xfer or $569 YOU ARE WELCOME TO GO TO THEIR SITE AND VERIFY.  If you are looking for a new M&P 9mm and want to save yourself $70 here you go, if you are looking to buy it to flip, well you can try but this price is FIRM so no need to contact me if you aren't willing to pay $500.  I don't have to sell it, and honestly don't care one way or the other especially with the gun laws looking like these will be the type ""EVIL HI-CAP"" Guns they will be banning.
