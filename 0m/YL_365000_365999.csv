Not a lot of history. Very very clean possibly refinished a time ago. The S# is traced back to mid 40's. Inherited from my father who had purchased early 90's from another party. He replaced the stock as the original was in bad shape. He stained it himself so not a perfect job but passable.  Looking for $700 or OBO, most of these for the condition and age go for $1000+ Would prefer to transfer through a local FFL."

 slide lock back issue has been fixed by taking out the extended slide stop lever and putting the stock one back in. As it turns out, i was pressing the extended slide stop lever while shooting and the stock one fixes taht as it does not stick back far enough for the thumb to ride on it. I shot some rounds through it loading up mags with 2-5 shots just to check the slide lockback and it works flawlessly.

shot 123 rounds through it and .40 just isn't my thing.

Wanting to trade this very nice 1903, The original 30-06. This one was manufactured in 1918. It has been sporterized, but was done a Long Long Time ago, and Looks professianally done. This is and always has been an awesome shooter. The only reason why I am considering trading away, is because after Shoulder Surgery, I have difficulty with the recoil. Also included in this trade will be 3 boxes Of Ammo, a Soft Sided carry case, as well as the scope pictured, 3-9 x 42. I have taken this to a few dealers, ie Cabelas etc, and they would retail it, by itself no ammo or case at $575.00, This is an awesome shooter, I hate to part with it, several Deer have dropped right where they were dead in their tracks, 
  I do not expect to get that, I would like to do a 2 for 1. The dealer told me to try shooting a 30-30, which I did and Like it. I also saw a Marlin 30-30 used in great shape for $259.99 which I almost bought but decided I would try this first. I would do a Trade for a 30-30 and a ruger 10/22, or perhaps a hand gun or even something semi auto in a caliber I can use for Deer hunting, semi autos absorb a lot of felt recoil, Remington Woodsmaster 7400-750, an AK47, or Mini 14 or 30.
     I know Walmart has the 10/22 for $227.00  If interested let me know what you have to offer, worst I can say is NO. Face to face meetup, no out of state shipping or transfer. Thanks"

The Hornady® 223 Rem 60 gr. TAP Urban® offers high velocity in 14.5"" or longer barreled weapons. It is the lightest grain weight that Hornady® recommends for 14.5"" barreled firearms with NATO chambers, and the heaviest weight acceptable for 1-12"" twist weapons. The 60 gr. bullet offers performance similar to that of other polymer tipped Hornady® 223 bullets, but with slightly higher retained weight and deeper, more consistent penetration. This bullet’s barrier performance is very similar to that of the 55 grain TAP Urban®, but slightly enhanced.

Intended for use in a 1-7""-1-12"" twist barrel. 
Performs optimally in a 1-9""-1-12"" twist.

I bought this as a defense gun and have since purchased another gun for defense.  I'd like to get in more range time and would like to do that with a 9MM.  I love this gun and that's why I want to stick with the XDm in the 9MM.

I purchased this gun new from Adventure Outdoors in Smyrna on 04/02/11.  I have maybe 500 rounds through it so far at the range and it's been cleaned after every trip.  I also have a few snap caps I'll throw in and a box of Speer Gold Dots.

If anyone is interesting in purchasing the gun I would take $500.00 for it.  That price is firm.

Please feel free to drop me a message with any questions.

Also have some other non-gun items to trade if you have a Mosin but aren't interested in the XDm. Sony Vaio PVC-RS220 desktop computer with 17"" Sony LCD and a Delta AP-400 dust collector. I'd trade even for the dust collector or about $100 and a Mosin for the computer. If you'd like pics or specs let me know."

If u look at the back of the receiver u can tell if it's converted. If the pistol grip sits directly under the receiver and the trigger cover sits against the magazine catch or magazine it's converted. If the pistol grip is behind the receiver and bolts on to the stock and not into the receiver, or their is space between the trigger guard/cover and the magazine then this is not converted. All it is, is a $65 tapco t-6 collapsing stock that anyone could put on one. Don't get fooled!!! Don't buy a saiga 12 that someone says is converted just because u don't know what it means.

I don't mind if the trade is a bit used and abused as long as it's solid, functional and fires without any problems. Caliber doesn't matter, it's to carry around in the glove box. I bought the P250 for that purpose but decided to not stray away from what I'm used to. Not interested in. 380's.

Not at all interested in trades other than a Sig handgun. Also not interested in separating any of the items or selling outright. FTF in Clark county Indiana with Carry permit in hand or we each FFL to FFL at own cost. Feel free to message questions or ask for contact info.

Will add cash for the right trade. ""How much cash will I add"" you ask? Depends entirely on your trade and how much cash you would ask to balance out the deal. Don't expect me to offer cash. The amount is up to you. The accepting or rejecting part is up to me. Make it real. :)

It is a curio/relic so Ill just get the cash and carry paper work ready and we can go that route. I do require you prove somehow that you are legally able to own a firearm so if you want to bring your most recent firearm receipt or pay the $25 background check at an FFL that works too. You wont be able to find this deal in a store, and if you do you’re going to have to wait the 10 days, pay the background check, pay tax, and probably remove a lot of annoying cosmoline.

This bow is built for hunting out of ground blinds, tree-stands, or the perfect bowfishing bow.
The Fred Bear® Supermag 48-in recurve bow is constructed with fiberglass limbs and a hard-rock maple handle that's crowned in the center and covered with soft Bear Hair for a true arrow flight. The fiberglass limb tip reinforcements let you get the most out of the Flemish string.

Bow is only 6 months old. Shot little less than a span of 2 months; approximately 1 day a week = approximately 8 days only!!! It is a GORGEOUS bow!!! Strung for an hour every-other-week to keep it healthy. Polished and waxed once a month to keep it pliable. 50 lbs draw. This is a very compact bow so it will start stacking at 29.5 inches. Was a gift but decided I am more of a compound bow person. Comes with a $20.00 stringer, $12.00 string keeper, an extra brand new $30.00 Dynaflight Flemish Twist String, $15.00 Clikety-Klicker draw length checker, & $45 1/2 Dz. Gold Tip Carbon Hunter Arrows.

One magazine is included.  

It's a very nice gun and you can disassemble it without tools.  The Target Sights are easily adjustable with a screwdriver and the long 5.5  inch barrel provides for excellent accuracy.  The magazine capacity is 10+1 Rounds.

The magazine eject button is about 2 inches below the trigger and is easily accessible by either hand.  Full Length Sight Bridge with Integral Weaver Style Optics Mount.

It's ideal for competitive target shooting, recreational shooting or training inexperienced shooters (because of the low recoil).   A 500 round box of 22LR ammo costs about $20 so you can practice often without breaking the bank.

 I just don't shoot it very often and want to clear the space in my safe.

If you see this post then I still have this gun as I always delete my posting once an item is sold.

Early Seventies, Excellent Shape, Very Close to Brand New, 4 Clips, Sling, Oiler, Clip Pouch 


The M1 carbine is an interesting little weapon. The original request for a compact and lightweight shoulder arm to replace service handguns for second-line (non-fighting) troops was first issued by US Army in 1938. The idea behind this request was that a shoulder arm, such as carbine, firing ammunition of moderate power, will have more effective range and will be much simpler to train the users to fire it accurately, than the standard .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol or revolver. This request was probably the first recognition of the need in the Personal Defense Weapon in the modern sense. 

In general, M1 Carbine was a really compact and handy weapon. It was lightweight and short enough to be more suitable for jungle combat, than a full-size battle rifles such as M1 Garand. It also offered relatively high practical rate of fire due to large-capacity, detachable magazines and low recoil. 

Technically, M1 Carbine is a gas operated, magazine fed, semi-automatic or select-fire (M2) short rifle. It uses the short-piston stroke gas operated action, designed by D. Williams. Gas piston is located under the middle of the barrel and has a travel of about 1/3 inch (8 mm). When gun is fired, the powder gases are bleed from the barrel into the gas chamber and propel the gas piston violently to the rear. The gas piston thus gives a sharp blow to the operating slide, which is located inside the stock and is linked to the rotating bolt, more or less similar to one found in M1 Garand rifle. The bolt has two forward lugs that locks into the receiver walls. The safety on all M1 carbines and variations is located at the front part of the triggerguard. On the earliest carbines the safety was in the form of the cross-bolt push-button but latter it was replaced by the lever-type switch, because in the heat of the combat the safety button was sometimes confused with magazine release button, located next to the safety. The fire mode selector on the M2 and M3 was located at the left side of the receiver. The cocking handle is permanently attached to the operating rod. Sights on the earlier M1 carbines had a flip-up rear diopter (peep-hole) with settings for 150 and 300 feets, and later rear sights were replaced by drift-adjustable diopter. Carbines were issued with sling and sometimes with additional pouch that was mounted on the buttstock and allowed to carry two spare magazines on the gun itself. Early M1 carbines had no provisions to mount a bayonet, however, some older models had bayonet lugs on the barrel."

With three people loading magazines, Jarrett started to shoot the new Para  1911 SSP. The more he shot the hotter the pistol got. Barrel temperatures became so hot that the ramped, stainless steel match barrel turned a deep golden color. But the pistol never missed a beat. 10 minutes and 44 seconds after he started, Jarrett had put 1,000 rounds through the pistol establishing a NEW World Record on the range at Blackwater USA.

He let the pistol cool and then, using a Chip McCormick 10-round Power Mag, shot a group on a steel plate at 10 yards with all shots touching.

For the next several hours, the magazine loaders took turns shooting the SSP with both the ICC frangible ammo and standard white box 230-grain ball ammunition until 5,000 rounds had been shot. The tough pistol digested all of the ammo without complaint. We do not recommend that you torture your 1911 for 4,000 rounds without cleaning it. But if your 1911 is a Para SSP, it can take it."

The Lee-Enfield series of rifles was born in 1895 as a marriage between the magazine and bolt action, designed by the J. P. Lee, and the new pattern of barrel rifling, designed at the Royal Small Arms Factory (RSAF) at Enfield. Early Lee-Enfield rifles, officially known as a "".303 caliber, Rifle, Magazine, Lee-Enfield"", were carried by the British army through the Boer war (South Africa) of 1899-1902, and Boers, armed with their Mausers, taught to the Brits some hard lessons. And, unlike some other Empires, Brits were quick lo learn. In 1903, they introduced a new design, which improved over the older Lee-Metfords and Lee-Enfields in some important respects. The main improvements was the introduction of the ""universal"" rifle idea. The common thinking of the period was to issue the long rifle for infantry and the carbine for cavalry, artillery and other such troops. The Brits decided to replace this variety of sizes with one, ""intermediate"" size, that will fit all niches. This ""one size fits all"" rifle was called "".303 caliber, Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield, Mark 1"", or, in short SMLE Mk.I, where ""short"" referred to the length of the rifle. This rifle passed some improvements during the following pre-WW1 years, finalizing in the 1907 as a SMLE Mk.III. 

The SMLE Mk.III was a really good rifle, quite accurate, reliable and suitable for rapid and accurate firing. British soldiers were rigorously trained for both individual and volley fire marksmanship, and were routinely capable of firing 30 aimed shots per minute, which was quite a rate of fire for any non-automatic rifle. There were times when advancing Germans were impressed that they were under the machine gun fire, when Tommie used their salvo-firing techniques. During the war time the basic Mk.III design was slightly simplified to better suit the mass production needs, with omission of ""volley"" sights and magazine cutoffs, and with some production shortcuts. The ""Rifle No.4 Mark 1"", widely known as a SMLE No.4 Mk.1, appeared in 1941. This was an improved and strengthened SMLE design, with heavier and stronger receiver, which also was faster and easier to machine, and with heavier barrel. 

It should be noted, that SMLE rifles were produced and used not only in the UK. Australian, Canadian and Indian factories turned out more than million of the No.1 rifles with various improvements, which were used during both World wars and thereafter. During the WW2, Britain also acquired quantities of SMLE No.4 (marked No.4 Mk.1*) made under contract at the Savage Arms company in USA. In the 1950s, Indian Isaphore arsenal turned out some SMLEs rechambered to the 7.62mm NATO (.308 win) ammunition. These are distinguishable from .303 caliber rifles by the more squared outline of the magazine. Total numbers of all 'Marks' and 'Numbers' of the SMLE made during the 60 years in various countries is not less than 5 000 000 (yes, five millions) rifles.
The SMLE is a manually operated, rotating bolt action magazine fed rifle. The Lee-designed SMLE magazine is a first easily distinguishable feature. It holds 10 rounds of ammunition in staggered column form, and while the magazine itself is detachable, it is not intended to be reloaded when detached from rifle. Early Lee-Enfields (Long Lee-Enfields and SMLEs prior to Mark III) were loaded only by single rounds via the top receiver opening. Latter, the clip (charger) loading was introduced, and a rear receiver bridge with charger clip guides was added to the design. Some of the earlier marks were then retrofitted with charger loading ability during the 1907 - 1910. To load the magazine, one must use two standard 5-rounds clips. Loading by loose rounds was still available, but some care must be taken when loading cartridges into clips or in the magazine, due to the rimmed ammunition cases. Prior to the 1916, all SMLEs (and earlier Long Lee-Enfields) were issued with so called ""magazine cut-off"" - a simple device, located at the right side of the receiver and intended to cut off the cartridge supply from magazine to the action when engaged, so rifle could be used as a single-loader, and ammunition in the magazine could be saved for the hottest moments of combat. This was an outdated idea even when it was first introduced, so it was easily discarded when the need to speed up production arose. The magazine itself should be detached only for cleaning, maintenance and repair, and every rifle was issued with only one magazine. The magazine catch is located inside the triggerguard.
The bolt action, another invention of the James Paris Lee (along with magazine), is the other most famous feature of the SMLE. The rotating bolt has two lugs that lock into the receiver walls at the rear part of the bolt, thus saving some part of the bolt length and bolt pull, when comparing to the forward lugs locking. This shorter bolt pull, along with charging handle, located at the rear part of the bolt and bent down, lent itself to quick reloading. Add a relatively high capacity magazine with fast clip reloading and here you have one of the fastest practical rates of fire along with contemporary designs. The SMLE was a striker fired gun, with cocking on the bolt close action and a dual-stage trigger. The bolt head with the extractor was a separate, non-rotating unit, screwed into the bolt body. The safety was located at the rear left side of the receiver and was easily operated by the firing hands' thumb finger. One notable feature of the Lee bolt action was that the bolts were not interchangeable between different rifles of the same mark Each bolt must have been fitted to its respective action, thus making the production and in-field bolt replacement more complicated. The insufficient headspace problem on the pre-No.4 SMLEs was solved my manual sandpapering the respective bolt-head, and since the No.4 rifle, there were 4 standard sizes of the bolt heads, from which armourer could select one, most suitable for the particular action.
The sights of the Mark III / No.1 Mk.3 SMLEs were a combination of the barleycorn front (an inverted V-shape) and V-notch adjustable rear sights, mounted on the barrel. The front sights were protected by the two ""ears"" on the stock nose-cap. Latter the front sight were changed to post type, and the rear - to the U-notch type, and since the introduction of the No.4 rifle the barrel-mounted open rear sight was replaced with peep-hole one, mounted on the receiver, which made the sighting line much longer and improved the long-range accuracy. Sniper No.4 Mk.1(T) rifles, made during the WW2, were equipped with detachable optical scope mounts at the left side of the receiver. The scope was carried in the separate box when not in use. No.4 Mk1* rifles, made during the WW2, were equipped with the simplified, two position aperture (peep-hole) sights, marked for 300 and 600 yards ranges only. Pre-1916 Lee-Enfields were also equipped with interesting device, called the ""volley"" sights. This device was mounted at the left side of the stock, ahead of the magazine, and was used to provide an indirect fire capability at the ranges from 2 000 and up to outstanding 3 900 yards (1800 - 3550 meters). While the individual marksmanship at such ranges with rifle was a nonsense, the salvo firing by large squads at the distant and large targets (such as tight infantry or cavalry formations) can do some damage to the enemy. This was, obviously, an idea of the pre - machine gun and pre - light artillery period, and it was happily dropped during the WW1.
The famous by its distinguishable shape stock of the SMLE featured a semi-pistol grip, a steel buttplate with a trapdoor and a compartment in the butt for tools and cleaning equipment. The ""flat-nosed"" forend covered the barrel up to the muzzle, and has a small stud, protruding forward under the muzzle for bayonet mounting. Most SMLEs have a small brass disc inset into the right side of the butt, which was used for regimental markings (unlike the German Mausers, where the similar steel disc was used as a bolt unit disassembly tool). The conventional sling swivels were mounted on the frond handguard band and under the butt. Mk.4 No1.(T) sniper rifles also featured an additional wooden cheek rest on the top of the butt for more comfortable sighting while using the scope.
In general the SMLE were ones of the best bolt action battle rifles, fast-firing, powerful and reliable. While being less suitable for ""sporterizing"" than Mausers, they are still popular among civilians as a hunting and plinking weapons, and also as a part of the history. The key deficiencies of the SMLE were probably the rimmed ammunition and non-interchangeability of bolts, but the advantages of this design were mush bigger and Lee-Enfields in all its guises served the Britain and the British Commonwealth for more than 60 years in the front line service and much longer as a specialized weapon (training and sniper)."

The idea of the compact firearm that will fire cartridge of intermediate power, allowing for effective range of about 500-800 meters or so caught on with Soviets who were set up to build a whole family of infantry weapons, designed around newly developed M43 7.62x39mm cartridge. This family included following guns: lightweight bolt action carbine - an idea that never left the prototype stage; a self-loading carbine; a select-fire assault rifle; and a light machine gun - squad automatic weapon. Assault rifle became the famous Kalashnikov AK-47. Squad automatic became the Degtyarov RPD. And self-loading carbine became the Simonov SKS.

The SKS (Samozaryadnyj Karabin Simonova = Simonov Self-loading Carbine) was designed by famous Russian arms designer Simonov, who already designed the self-loading rifle AVS-36 and an anti-tank rifle PTRS. First prototypes were built in the early 1945, and were tested in small numbers on the front against Germans. In consequent years both SKS and the cartridge were refined and in 1949 this carbine was officially adopted by the Soviet Army as an ""7.62mm Samozaryadnyj Karabin Simonova obr. 1945 goda - SKS"". SKS was brought into service along with the Kalashnikov AK-47, and was widely used during the first two or three post-war decades. With the increased numbers of the AK-47 and AKM brought into service, numbers of the SKS in the front-line services gradually declined, but some SKS were still used by non-infantry and second-line units of the Soviet Army as late as 1980s and even 1990s. At the present time most army stocks of SKS are in storage or sold as surplus on both domestic and foreign markets, and the most notable role of the SKS is that it is still used as a ceremonial weapon by the various Russian Honor Guards.

As with many other soviet weapons of the post-war period, the licenses to SKS design were sold or given to some Soviet-friendly countries, such as China, DDR (East Germany), Yugoslavia, Albania and some others. These countries also built vast numbers of SKS with some minor derivations from original design. So, Chinese SKS featured spike-shaped bayonets instead of original blade-shaped ones. Yugoslavian SKS carbines often were equipped with combined muzzle device - rifle grenade launcher, grenade sights and a gas cut-offs. Other variations also existed. Many off those carbines, along with the original Russian ones, were sold as a military surplus during the last decades, either in the original for or in the ""civilized"" form, with bayonets removed. Cheap prices of both carbines and 7.62x39mm ammunition added to a popularity of SKS on the civilian markets. Being a sound, but outdated military design, SKS is a great all-around civilian arm, capable of numerous functions: small and even a medium game hunting, plinking, home defense. Wide variety of aftermarket accessories (stocks, sight mounts, sights, large-capacity magazines, bipods etc etc) only helped to keep this neat gun on the market.

SKS is a gas operated, magazine fed, self-loading weapon. It utilizes a short-stroke gas piston with its own return spring, and a tilting bolt locking, where a bolt tips down to lock onto the floor of the receiver. Charging handle is attached to the right side of the bolt carrier and moves when gun is fired. Receiver is machined from steel. SKS is fed from the integral 10-rounds magazine, which could be loaded from the top through the open bolt by loose cartridges or by using special 10 rounds stripper clips. Stripper clip guides are machined into the front of the bolt carrier. SKS features a bolt catch device, an essential feature for any clip-loaded firearm. Magazine can be safely and quickly unloaded via swing-down opening magazine cover. SKS is a hammer-fired gun. Safety switch is located inside the triggerguard. SKS features a single-piece wooden stock, a hooded post-type front sight and a range-adjustable open rear sight. Military-issue SKS carbines are equipped with non-detachable bayonets, that could be folded down and backward when not in use. Soviet, East German and Yugoslavian carbines use blade-shaped bayonets, Chinese Type 56 carbines use spike-shaped bayonets, which are slightly longer than blade-shaped ones.

In general, the SKS is an excellent all-around weapon that offers slightly longer range and better accuracy than Kalashnikov AK-47, but, for military use, lacks the magazine capacity and selective-fire capabilities. But for civilian use it's still hard to beat, especially when it comes to the cost/effectiveness issues."

Listening to the demands of the customer, DPMS unveiled the LR-308 AP4 in 2005. Featuring a standard A3 height receiver rail, with forward assist and dust cover, standard A2 front fixed sight, detachable rear sight, or detachable carry handle, and a collapsible stock, the AP4 caught the attention of recreational and competition shooters, as well as the law enforcement and military community.
It’s popularity as one of the most compact, light, and yet effective 308 carbines on the market earned it the title of NRA rifle of the year in 2006.

picked this beauty up about 2 months ago. I have only put about 100 rounds through it. Not a single problem with the functionality at all. It is easy to disassemble and clean. This one was purchased in error as I intended to purchase the sub-compact. I have enjoyed shooting this one so much that I have replaced it with the sub-compact version already but have just been slow to turn this one loose."

I will also throw in an old Bushnell Sportview 3x9 (though you will need to get scope rings for it)

The Marlin 39 is the cream of the crop of lever 22's, often imitated, and never duplicated (sorry Henry rifles) 

Those of you with Marlin 39's on your radar know that they are becoming a rare find this old and in this good of shape. It is only being considered for sale because I have recently even bit by the 1911 bug. 

Please don't try to lowball me, i am not hard up for cash, and the only trades are noted below. FTF in Portland metro area (though I may consider a little travelling for the right 1911). 

ONLY trades I am specifically interested in (I will of course put cash on top for the right firearm): 

1. Colt 1911 
2. Remington R1 Enhanced 
3. Other quality 1911's considered on a case by case basis, but the top two will be given priority

The Advanced M26 Series TASER® is one of the most effective non-lethal weapons available today. Using Electro-Muscular Disruption technology, the TASER® has a higher instant incapacitation rate than a 9mm hand gun. The M26 shoots 2 darts attached to 15 feet of wire. 50,000 volts travel over the wires & over-ride the central nervous system of the attacker. The electric current is released in a pre-timed sequence to make sure the assailant is unable to recover quickly enough to remove the darts.
• The TASER® M26 comes with a laser for accurate aiming.
 • Includes 4 cartridges, case, and target.

 Registered trademark of TASER International, Inc.

 Effectiveness 
TASER ECDs are the ONLY devices that can consistently incapacitate aggressive, dangerous people. They bring incredible stopping power that has been field-tested by thousands of law enforcement officers around the world. They are safer and more effective than other options, such as sprays or direct contact stuns, that require potentially dangerous chemicals or close range to an attacker and often prove to be ineffective on individuals under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. TASER ECDs allow you to take control of your personal safety.
 Easy To Use 
Unlike other self-defense options, a TASER ECD can be used and is effective on any area of the body. This is critically important if youâ€™re in a highly stressful, dangerous situation that requires you to quickly to defend yourself and/or your loved ones. Itâ€™s as easy as point and shoot.
 Legal To Carry In Most States 
TASER devices are not considered firearms by the U.S. Government. They can be legally carried (concealed or open) without permit in 43 states. Use of TASER ECDs is prohibited in DC, HI, MA, MI, NJ, NY, RI, WI and certain other cities and counties. Check local laws before purchasing or carrying ECDs.

Activation/Registration required for unit to operate. Age and background check will be performed at time of purchase.

TASER® electronic control devices are not considered firearms and are legal to carry in most states without permits (including California). Restricted from citizen use in MA, RI, NY, NJ, WI, MI, HI, and certain cities and counties.

When ordering by way of this shopping cart, please state in the customer notes if you want your billing or shipping address used for the background check and add your birth date, Social Security Number, Drivers License State and Number as well as expiration date. If you are not comfortable leaving this information in the customer comments area, please call as the M26C Models ship live and ready to use and Taser® will not ship the unit unless they have completed the background check on the purchaser."

It is in very good condition and only has some very minor holster wear on the slide near the muzzle. This pistol comes with two magazines. This firearm has not been modified in any way from it's original manufacture in Poland. Whomever had this weapon issued to them (Polish Army or Police Officer) obviously took good care of it and also didn't fire it much. This weapon has a chrome-lined barrel and shoots the 9mm Makarov (9x18) round. 

If you want more info. on this firearm, check out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-64_(pistol)

I am also including in this sale, two custom made holsters for this pistol. As you will find, the holster selection for this pistol is slim to none. One holster I had hand-made by a local holster craftsman here in central PA is a pancake holster in dark brown leather. With this holster, the pistol rides very close to the body and is virtually undetectable even under a simple T-shirt. The other holster was hand-made by Robert Mika (LAPD-retired) and is one of his famous pocket-holsters. This holster is fabulous and stays in your pocket when drawing the pistol.

Also included with the sale is 500 rounds of 9mm Makarov (9x18) ammo.

Before you ask... No, I won't break up the items. Without the pistol I have no need for the holsters or ammo. 

$495.00, firm. The only reason I am selling is because I originally intended this to be a gift for a family member, only to find out they really like the pistol however prefer a revolver. 

Bottom line... it's a great concealed carry pistol and it packs a hard punch!!! This is a FTF sale at a local FFL here in the York/Harrisburg area. Buyer pays all transfer fees.

These pistols are becoming harder and harder to find, especially in such good condition as this one!"
