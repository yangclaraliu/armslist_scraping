See if you can answer these questions - which every American who loves his country should be able to answer:
1. When and where was the American Revolution won, according to John Adams?
2. When and where did the Revolutionary War break out?
3. What caused the British Regulars, the most well-trained, well-disciplined army in the world, to break and run at Concord's North Bridge, after only two minutes of musket fire by shopkeepers and farmers?
4.  What caused this reversal of British military opinion:

BEFORE April 19, 1775:
""Americans are raw, undisciplined and cowardly"". John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich and 1st Lord of the Admiralty 

""With a thousand British grenadiers I would undertake to go from one end of America to the other and geld all the males, partly by force and partly with a little coaxing"". Major General Alured Clarke 

AFTER April 19, 1775:
""Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself very much mistaken. They have men amongst them who know very well what they are about..."" Lieutenant-General Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland

Order NEW Remington $870's for around $300 as well as Mossberg, Henry, & Many other Rifles & Shotguns. This post is for the honest guys trying to buy guns without getting ripped off by the abusers of this website. I apologize to those good guys trying to sell their guns to make a mortgage who are not using this as a scammer site like the old SwapGiant that shut down... looks like we got a lot of their ""salesmen.""

Have been bidding on some Remington 870's on the site and they seemed to be rather expensive, especially those that are used. I happened to be in the Milford Walmart around Cincinnati (Eastgate & Amelia as well as others across the State sell firearms - not all Walmarts) and found that the not only sell BRAND NEW 870's for less than what most on here want for highly used ones but they have an online catalog and one behind the desk where you can order all kinds of rifles & shotguns new cheaper than Bass Pro, Dicks, or anyone else. By the way new 870's start around $330 and no charge to order just put a deposit. They have a large selection through the ordering process so don't settle for what is behind the desk if you can wait about 2-weeks."

Reason I'm selling is because the scope is too long for my Ruger Takedown.

The Original Raging Bulls are still among America's favorite hunting handguns. Chambering the popular and powerful .44 Magnum and 454 Casull rounds, the mighty 444 and 454 revolvers are built for a lifetime of tough use. Offering award-winning designs in four distinct barrel lengths, these monsters feature a crisp trigger break and smooth pull for accuracy, cushioned grips and factory porting to reduce felt recoil.

	Dual lockup cylinder Provides stability under extreme chamber pressures.

Cushioned insert grip
Exclusive on the RAGING ™ Series large frame revolvers, Cushioned insert grip pillows recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
 	Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
 	Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
 	Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

My photos are stock and some I took with my phone.  I can provide additional photos to serious buyers.  Additional photos are not going to show you anything about the gun you can't learn from the internet.  It is spotless like it came from the factory.

If you are not close enough to pickup in person I can have my dealer ship the gun to your FFL dealer.  Payment is in advance.  References upon request."

This is the action of an M1, but purpose-built as a handgun.  It is NOT a shortened rifle and so has no NFA restrictions on ownership.

This particular model came from the factory with a gold-plated finish and I believe the stock is walnut.

There are a couple nicks in the finish on the stock, and the gold plating on the barrel is a bit worn as a result of the weapon being fired.  But overall, this handgun is in very good condition and would make a fantastic addition to any collection.

It comes with one factory gold-plated magazine and one US GI magazine, both with 30 round capacity.

The bow is in great shape, great cosmetics and shoots flawlessly.  I can reach out and hit a paper plate pretty consistently at 50 yards, extremely consistently at 40.  When I used it I had the bow set at 40 yards and could hit an apple more times than not.  Very accurate!

The scope is also in great shape (with box).  A compact 3x9 42mm quick release system.  It has the ability to illuminate the reticule and has an adjustable laser built into the scope.  Has never been mounted on a high recoil weapon (only the bow and a .22).  Has the P4 sniper reticule which turns out great for the cross bow because you can have multiple zeros.  The scope also has a BDC (bullet drop compensator) set up for .223 55gr bullets for 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 yards.  Never tried it on an AR but reviews say it works well.  I used it to go through my multiple zeros with my bow (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 yards).  Yes, I still have the original peep sight for it if you like that set up better.

It's in .308 and has two twenty round mags and is in great USED condition.  This is the SAR48 (Springfield Armory Rifle) MATCH receiver (built to avoid ban so is stamped SAR 4800 on opposite side of receiver) and has not been 'tinkered' with.  I believe these were built with inch parts, but not certain.  It is not the Israeli version that's much bulkier.  I've owned this for years and seldom took it out of the gun safe.  As with the original FN battle rifle (the Right Hand of the Free World), this has the gas piston operation and adjustable gas valving that makes the rifle so incredibly reliable and pleasant to shoot.  I don't have a better camera, so the photos you see are all I can provide.  The VW in the background does NOT go with the rifle.  Ebay generally has at least one or two of the SUIT scope/mount units that look great on these rifles for under $400 which would add a great deal of value to this piece.   Don't confuse this with the Century Arms mixed mfr parts guns.  This is not an inflated or desperation price.  Prefer not to ship.  Note: I'll accept an exc to new Rem 700 VTR in .308 as partial payment on this. Thanks for looking."

Online Excerpt:
Today, the modern military force may need more than one version of the same piece of equipment to satisfy different field requirements. In the case of the seemingly simple knife, as many as four knives may be issued to a single force - each with its own purpose. A standard issue stainless steel scuba knife, for example, would not be suitable for use in operations where non magnetic properties are required. The Multi Purpose Knife, as the name would imply, is designed to serve in a variety of missions. Titanium was selected for the blade based on the unique combination of properties inherent to the metal. The result is a light weight, non magnetic, non corrosive, and multi functional knife.

The pistol is in almost new condition with the exception of some very minor holster wear on the top of the slide. Otherwise, the pistol is in excellent condition.

Included with the pistol is the original Glock case, three 17rd. Glock magazines w/speed loader, paperwork including manual, cable lock, fired case, and back straps w/ tool, as well as a Galco IWB holster and a Safariland duty-style belt holster. I will also included 50rds. of +P+ self-defense ammunition. 

I will also trade my Gen 4 Glock 17 for a Gen 3 Glock 17 or 19 that is in as good condition as my 17 or close to it. I am selling my Glock due to my moving to CA. Gen 4 Glocks are not approved for sale or ownership in CA yet. Go figure... Anyway, Gen 3 Glocks are approved in CA so if a trade can be worked out, that is great. Will ONLY trade Dorby Gen 3 17. 

Asking $550 for everything listed above. Kind of firm on price since the pistol is very lightly used and you get two holsters and ammunition as well. Great deal I think. Emails go to my phone so I will respond quickly. Thanks for looking!!"

The world's first digital riflescope brings the power of modern electronics and software to the shooting sports.

Electronic ballistic compensation enables the shooter to 'hold where you want to hit™! DigitalHunter is a range compensating riflescope, removing one contributor (holdover estimate) from the shooting equation. The four field selectable reticles, when coupled with the four ballistic data tables, enable the scope to function as four different riflescopes. It can be setup for a centerfire rifle, a shotgun (great for turkey), a crossbow and a muzzleloader. Since the reticles are graphic images they can be any color, shape or size that can be drawn by the user visa bitmap generating software...circles, lines, squares. Parallax is avoided since they aren't physical features of an image plane

There have only been approx 1000 Rounds through this rifle with ZERO malfunctions or misfires.  The model is a Modified STAR 15 which is the StarCar Model on their website.  It is a 16"" model with adjustable butt stock, tact rail on reciever.  I baby all of my guns and when they are shot they are cleaned and oiled.  I could sell this gun and sight as brand new because of their condition but that would not be truthful.  Also included is an Aimpoint PRO reddot site.  If you know anything about red dots then you know Aimpoint is the industry standard top of the line sight.  The PRO is a CompM3 with a lower price just for law enforcement sales.  It has a 2 MOA dot and all the same specs of a CompM3.  Just look and compare on Aimpoint website.  I also bought Lancer LP5 Translucent 30rd mags which come with the gun as well.  All of this comes in a Condor Tactical Rifle Case in Digital Camo Color.  This case is completely compatible with all MOLLE style attachments.
Everything you see in the photo comes with the gun.  The following items are included in the purchase:
Doublestar AR15 StarCar; MSRP 859.99
Aimpoint PRO; MSRP $420.99 Law Enforcement 
Lancer LP5 30Rd Mags x 2 MSRP; $25.99 Each
Condor Tactical Rifle Case; MSRP $109.99
American Eagle Tactical .223 Ammo (200); MSRP 89.99
Total MSRP Price for Set is $1532.94
YOUR COST $1200.00 OBO.  I will negotiate a little on the price but only if certain factors are met.  If you want this shipped it will have to be to FFL at the buyers expense.  If you want to meet up and exchange for cash we can work out a deal as well.  Just contact me if interested.
I will only break up the package if you dont want the Aimpoint but everything else other wise it must stay together.
Thank You!"
