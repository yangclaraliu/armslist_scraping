 This is the 9mm version and comes in hard plastic case and sleeve
 Description 
Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Pistol Model in 9mm. It's been stored and is in excellent condition. The gun pictured may have a different serial number, but is a NIB Uzi. 
The UZI pistol was developed by Israel Military Industries (now IWI Ltd) during early 1980s from the famous Micro-UZI submachine gun. Intended users for the UZI pistol were various security agencies and services which wanted a high-capacity semi-automatic pistol, and civilian shooters (mostly in USA) which also wanted such gun with ""cool Uzi style"". Despite somewhat rough appearance UZI pistols were reliable and quite accurate. It also must be noted that 'original' UZI pistols should not be confused with full-size weapons based on semi-automatic only full-size Uzi carbines but without the shoulder stock. 
UZI pistol is blowback-operated semi-automatic weapon which fires from closed bolt. It has a stamped steel receiver and the bolt is fully enclosed inside. Bolt is of 'telescoped' design, that is, it is hollow in the front and encloses the rear part of the barrel when in battery. Uzi pistol has a single action trigger and utilizes an internal sliding striker (firing pin). Manual safety of sliding type, and is located above the grip on the left side of the gun. Magazines are of double stack design, interchangeable with other guns of Uzi family (in 9mm caliber). Sights are of open type, with flip-up rear sight, adjustable for windage. The guns were manufactured and fully assembled in Israel. Action Arms imported them as complete guns. You'll get the highest quality UZI Pistol you can get.

Cal. 22 s,l,lr, Ser. # 2615XXX puts date of manufacture at 1974. In continuous production since 1897, the 39A is by most accounts, one of the finest 22 rifles ever made. This 38 year old example is in as fine a condition as you're likely to find short of new. Wood and metal are in perfect condition with only a couple of tiny storage rub marks on the stock which are even hard to bring up in the photos. Bore and action are perfect - feeds, fires, & ejects with no issues, and it is very accurate. 1974 production was before the lawyers (crossbolt safety, rebounding hammer, etc.) and Remington mucked up a perfect design, and it will be a great shootable, collectable addition to any collection. You will not be disappointed with this one. $450.00 + $15.00 for insured delivery to your FFL.

The Wood is in very good shape with a few scratches here and there, again as is typical. Some shellac has come off the hadguard, but has not really damaged the wood itself.

Here is what most people care about, the rifle is all matching, non-force matched. The scope mount is of course a renumber, but very few PU's are not.

The gun is in good condition with some light holster wear on the slide, but nothing unusual.  There is also a bit of wear on the slide release and the front sight, again from normal use.  Other than the normal wear, there are no other defects to be noted, cosmetically or functionally.  It fires smoothly, as is expected with any Glock, and has never malfunctioned while in my possession (or before to the best of my knowledge).  

It is a prior service-pistol with a State of Georgia stamp on the front left of the slide (shown in pictures).  It reads "" GA DNR WILDLIFE RESOURCES"" and the stamp shows an outline of Georgia with a state seal in the middle, as well as the inscription ""DEPT OF NATURAL RESOURCES - GEORGIA"".

The gun has been outfitted with Trijicon night sights which still glow brightly in the dark.  It comes with 50 rounds of Blazer 180 grain FMJs, 50 rounds of American Eagle 180 grain FMJs, and 20 rounds of Hornady Critical Duty 175 grain FlexLock Hollow Points (because no gun should be without self-defense ammo), one 15 round Glock magazine, one NEW Blackhawk Inside-the-Waistband holster, and a NEW Plano Protector Series case. 

If bought separately and new, all of this would cost around $700, but since the gun is used, I'm letting it all go for $500.   

I'll be traveling from Warner Robins to Atlanta and Valdosta over the next couple of week, so we can make a face to face transaction.  Also, I'll write up a Bill of Sale with the transaction.  Thanks for looking!!"

It is in excellent mechanical condition. It locks up extremely tight, like the cylinder is welded kind of tight. The trigger is smooth and crisp, especially in single action. The blued finish is in about 95% condition, with a few spots of minor (very minor) pitting. It has a vintage '80s Hogue Monogrip on it. It is plastic, as opposed to the newer rubber Hogue grips. It is very comfortable. The grip is missing the screw that attaches it, as well as the ""saddle"" part that goes on the bottom of the frame for the screw to screw into. You can get both parts directly from Hogue for cheap; I called them to see. Even without the screw holding the grip on, it is a very tight fit on the gun. It feels like it IS attached with a screw. You could probably shoot it as it is without the grip shifting, but that is your call. I am asking $300 for this gun. Call or text me (text is preferable) at 317-529-seven two nine nine.

Rapid and simple calculation of the amount of sight correction necessary to compensate for bullet drop and/or wind drift for a given range, enabling the shooter to determine either the equivalent telescopic sight adjustment (minute-of-angle, or MOA) or the equivalent hold-over (mils), by reading equivalents in both MOA and mils directly opposite the bullet drop/wind drift figure.

Additionally, angle of fire for uphill or downhill shots can be accurately measured, and the up/down compensation can be closely calculated to reduce the errors such shots can induce."

The textured grip is awesome, and it is similar to the new Generation 4 Glocks with the texturing being smaller than the Gen4 texturing. Feels great in the hand, and it shoots great too! The curved slide serrations on the rear of the slide give a much better purchase than the original. You can see by the pictures that it has little wear and the last picture shows the low round count it has. Comes in original case with paperwork, 2 mags, and if it sells this weekend I'll throw in a brand new grip plug for it as well. Thanks for looking!

LOT #107:  Marlin 99M1 22LR carbine

I have done more research on this missing serial number and I have learned this was manufactured in September of 1966 (two letter code on the barrel). This was 2 years prior to the GCA of 1968. I understand that in late 1967 Marlin started putting serial numbers on these little 22 rifles. Do your own research, this is not a guaranty of date.

Marlin only made this gun a few years (1966-1978) as I understand. It was styled to resemble the US Army M1 carbine, with eighteen inch barrel, handguard, barrel band, nine shot magazine even with the end of the stock! This was prior to making the cheaper and widely popular model 60. This features a walnut stock VS the newer birch stock. It also has a brass feed tube instead of the steel one found on the model 60. 

This is a fun shooter and a cool piece of history!"

Beauty of a shooter chambered in .308. No sob story here, not hard up for money, didnt lose my job, I just have ZERO time for long range shooting, and I refuse to let this rifle waste away in a safe its whole life. 

Will shoot sub MOA even with a crappy shooter, I know from experience, haha. Built on a Rem 700 base, short action, but that is where the original rifle ends. Has fully bedded HS precision stock, pac nor barrel, Jewell trigger, oversized bolt handle, olive drab duracoat in good shape. Pivoting bipod also included.

Stock has been sanded a few times and sprayed so it isnt perfect, hence the price, which can also include the Bushnell Elite 7-21x  scope if you add in another $300 (so total $1500 with scope).

I picked up this M+M M10 AK74 because the ammo is super cheap to shoot.  The stock is adjustable/collapsible for length of pull and can also side fold letting you store it compactly.  The folder is top of the line and locks up tight - there's no play in it like in Tapco stocks.  The red dot sight allows co-witness (lower 1/8th ish). I am the original owner.  Here is what the package entails:

 M+M M10 AK74, around 1k rounds through it. Zero mag wobble.  Cleaned after every firing.
=======================
-Attero Arms red dot sight mount
-Primary Arms red dot sight
-BoneSteel Arms left side folding stock adapter
-Magpul MOE stock
--QD Sling Swivel
-Hogue AK Pistol grip
-KVar Handguards
-Original quad rail (not pictured)
- Tapco G2 trigger

11 Magazines
=========
-6 Surplus Polymer (5 Bulgarian, 1 Sanitized Russian)
-3 Tapco mags
-2 Promags

Ammo can with 1,230 rounds
===================
-New ammo can
- 420 rounds 7n6 surplus - 5x30, 9x30 packed
- 690 rounds Tula - 5x30rds in mags, 27x20 packed
- 120 rounds Hornady Polymer tipped V-Max Steel Cased - 30 in a  ready mag, 90 packaged

I have over $1,450 invested in this package, looking to get $1,150 for everything - for what you'd pay for one AR you can get an AK, mags, optic and ammo.  It's a nice start for a SHTF setup or an easy way to get into the AK game. Since I am being honest, I will say the finish scratches easily - there are some small scratches here and there.  The PA red dot has two marks that would probably touch up easily enough with a black permanent marker, but they're there.  Also some of the surplus mags have some scratches - mostly minor, but one has some armature checkering from some bored foreign soldier and another has some initials carved in it.  Just wanted full disclosure - this is a fighting gun, not a safe queen.

I will happily sign a bill of sale if you would like and would like to see NC DL (or State ID) or Military ID and a copy of your orders if you're in the military.

-Beamshot GreenBeam 2000 Daylight Laser Sight is the most innovative of the laser sights available today. This is the first of the laser gun sights manufactured with a green laser beam - this color is one of the most sensitive to the human eyes. The 532nm green laser diode, along with exceptional glass optics, produces a 1 mile nighttime range and is even visible in broad daylight. Similar to the Beam Shot GreenBeam 1000 Daylight Laser Sight, the Green Beam 2000's laser is 20 times brighter than red laser sights and produces a target dot smaller than 2"" at 100 yards for precise accuracy. It is also easily adjusted, with windage and elevation adjustment screws that are slotted for adjustment with a coin or a screwdriver. The Beamshot GreenBeam True Daylight Lasersight 2000 delivers unmatched target acquisition anytime, all the time."

My loss is your gain. I shoot a 4"" and I don't need this one hanging around. Only reason I can't list it as brand new is because I'm not a dealer. I say ""unfired"" because it is literally unfired except from the factory.

Smith and Wesson 686 -6 .357 Distinguished Combat Magnum 6-shot in 2 1/2"" barrel with red ramp, white outline sights, smooth combat trigger and Smith and Wesson factory Hogue grips. It's never been fired and is in pristine condition. Not a scratch or a bump. It doesn't even have a tell tale ""turn ring"" on the cylinder, indicative of being in use. It comes with original box and all paperwork, cable lock, etc.

I'm asking $650.00 ""cash"" in the Winfield area. This is priced $40.00 cheaper than Buds cash price and $60.00 cheaper than cash price plus the $20.00 transfer. So you're getting a vitually brand new Smith 686 for $60.00 right off the top, plus no 4473 because I'm not a dealer and it's from my collection. No trades please.

I am thinking about trading my AR.  This AR was built on RRA website and ordered with the features i wanted. Features include- Light weight barrel, Tan operator Stock, Quad Rail, Detachable Front sight, RRA tactical Muzzle break, Chromed Bolt and components, Chromed Two Stage Trigger, Dual Loop, Tan houge grip, Flat top, BCM gunfighter charging handle with large latch, Winter trigger guard.  I also added a Magpul fore Grip, Dawson Precision Mag well, 3 Magpul mags with tactical but plates, 5 Military issued mags, Surefire Wepon light with IR filter and external pressure switch. The rifle has no rear sight. This gun has exactly 36 rounds through it of Federal ammo. Still have factory paperwork and warranty card.  The gun is FLAWLESS and 36 rounds from being new.  Was built to be lightweight for 3 gun matches. This is not a $700 dollar DPMS with cheap parts added.  I have approximately 290 rounds of Federal brass  cased ammo and about 200+ rounds of silver/brown bear ammo from the last AR. Over 2,000$ in this package + ammo.. Just seeing if i can find something i want. I have had the rifle about 3 months and only taken out twice, First time 31 rounds fired at IDPA target from 25 yards (with no rear sight) hitting head shots no problem. Second time 5 rounds fired blowing up binaries. I have no need to get rid of the gun and unless you have what im interested in i will keep it and compete with it next year."

Serial number places its build date between 1919 and 1921, meaning it was one of the earliest models to feature a heat treated cylinder. Includes original checkered wood grips and Pachmayr rubber grips.

Action is butter smooth and solid, lockup is fine, and the trigger is sublime at about 3.5 lbs. It's an accurate and sweet shooting gun. Barrel is dark and shows a very small amount of pitting, but the rifling is still going strong. 
The nickel finish is in rough shape, but there is zero rust on the gun.

This is truly a great shooter with a lot of character, and is in excellent shape considering its age. Almost a century old and still rock solid and dependable from a time where things were built to last.
I'm not too intent on getting rid of it but wanted to see what I could get.

This is the 9mm version and comes in hard plastic case and sleeve
Description 
Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Pistol Model in 9mm. It's been stored and is in excellent condition. The gun pictured may have a different serial number, but is a NIB Uzi. 
The UZI pistol was developed by Israel Military Industries (now IWI Ltd) during early 1980s from the famous Micro-UZI submachine gun. Intended users for the UZI pistol were various security agencies and services which wanted a high-capacity semi-automatic pistol, and civilian shooters (mostly in USA) which also wanted such gun with ""cool Uzi style"". Despite somewhat rough appearance UZI pistols were reliable and quite accurate. It also must be noted that 'original' UZI pistols should not be confused with full-size weapons based on semi-automatic only full-size Uzi carbines but without the shoulder stock. 
UZI pistol is blowback-operated semi-automatic weapon which fires from closed bolt. It has a stamped steel receiver and the bolt is fully enclosed inside. Bolt is of 'telescoped' design, that is, it is hollow in the front and encloses the rear part of the barrel when in battery. Uzi pistol has a single action trigger and utilizes an internal sliding striker (firing pin). Manual safety of sliding type, and is located above the grip on the left side of the gun. Magazines are of double stack design, interchangeable with other guns of Uzi family (in 9mm caliber). Sights are of open type, with flip-up rear sight, adjustable for windage.

It is the nickel plated model with rosewood grips and has a serial number of 113846 on both the frame and stamped on the inside of one of the grips. The plating has come off on both ends of the barrel (about 3/8"" total) and also on the top of the frame it is flaking. It does show signs of use. It functions well but is a little sloppy. Of course I would not recommend firing it. 

The most unique part about this revolver is when I initially removed the grips for inspection. Inside, a small folded piece of paper tacked inside was discovered. It was very fragile due to age but it was a lock of hair folded in a ""Hagerty Bros."" paper advertisement. Hagerty was I believe a drug store in the 19th century but I believe the ad has nothing to do with the hair. It was just a scrap used to hold the hair.

Also, written on the same grip that the paper was tacked is a name faintly written in pencil. It appears to say ""Bock"" but I am unsure. I have removed the paper and put it in a small envelope due to the paper nearly falling apart. It certainly could have research potential if the buyer contacts S&W for the records on this SN.

White dot is good for rapid target acquisition and green tritium is for low light /no light conditions. Nothing wrong with it,  I just decided to reinstall stock front sight blade for range work as I have the Crimson Trace Laser on it for defensive use and thought this XS sight would be a bit redundant. 

Tritium insert is still bright, but I'm not sure how old it is as I bought the revolver used. Original owner purchased revolverl in November 2009 and bought/installed the sight sometime between then and whenI bought it from him in 2012. There is an ""11"" on the sight...I'm not sure if that's the year it was produced or not. 

Includes White Dot / Trijicon sight, new roll pin, blue Loc-Tite, original package & directions, and correct punch to remove old sight roll pin and then install new one.
