One of the most accurate .50BMG rifles available.  It will shoot sub MOA in the right hands, which are not mine.  I got it in trade with a Bushnell 10X scope mounted (the one that comes on Barrett .50 ""kits"") which seems to hold up to the reverse recoil of the .50 just fine.  That said, a rifle of this caliber needs quality glass and I just don't feel like spending the money for a Nightforce or a Swarovski on a rifle that I barely shoot (I prefer to pack light).  If I shot match, it might be a different story, but since I don't, I'd rather have the cash and focus on my other precision rifles.  Note:  This is not the National Match edition, which has a tighter chamber and can have issues with military ammo (I hear).  Anyway, here is what you get:

- Rifle ($3,359)
- 15MOA scope base ($80)
- Bushnell 10X mildot ($200)
- Prince Bipod ($213)
- OD Green Pelican Case for the kit ($300)
- 10 rounds of Hornady A-MAX ($50)
Over $4,200 has been spent on this rifle.

I am open to trades: Savage 110B, Robinson XCR, PWS Diablo upper, SCAR, .300 Blackout SBR/Pistol upper, Aimpoint Micro, Aimpoint/Eotech 3X Multiplier, etc.  
As you can see, I'm only interested in quality products.  If you have something else you think I might like, let me know.  I am also looking to get a quality 60-80 gallon air compressor as well, so if you have one we can work it into the deal.

Obviously, I can pull the scope, as this is a ""starter scope"" for a rifle of this caliber.

I must say, this thing is insanely fun to shoot.  I have shot many .50BMG rifles, and the Armalite is by far the most enjoyable.

The RFB is not for sale, just for scale.

By responding to this post, you are stating you are of age, not a felon, and can legally own this weapon.

The gun comes with one G27 magazine and one G22 magazine.

Here is a list of the customizations:
1) Ghost Ultimate 3.5lb. connector (the best on the market, IMHO!)
2) TruGlo Tritium Bright/Night sights have been installed. (They are awesome all day long!)
3) The gripframe has been Duracoated maroon.

5) The barrel has been matte hard chrome plated by Accurate Plating & Weaponry.
6) I’ve installed an extended slide release, Duracoated in HK Black.
7) A Pierce +1 extension, Duracoated in HK black, has been added to the G27 magazine. 
8) A universal ClipDraw, Duracoated in HK black, has been installed for right hand IWB carry.
9) The gripframe has been reduced to G27 size for ease of concealment.
10) The gripframe has also been stippled and lightly sanded prior to Duracoating to improve grip.
11) All lettering has been painted white.

This pistol looks AWESOME and is a pleasure to shoot! Building it was a fun project but it’s time to move on to something new. I don’t want this beauty to turn into just another safe queen. 

I’ve got more than $800 into this gun, but I'm asking substantially less. Reasonable offers only. No low-balls, please. Cash only. All original parts and a soft zippered case will be included.

Face-to-face buyers must be willing to sign a simple sales receipt (we’ll each get a copy) and show me their OH driver’s license or concealed handgun license to confirm age and OH residency.

Reason:
Bought a new car, no need for the truck anymore. Purchased as a winter vehicle but needs some things.

4x4 needs transfer case to be replaced to operate 100%, part is 231D and 272 Ratio as the mechanic put it. 4x4 is working but very rough shape due to the current transfer case being completely worn out.
Driver side door does not currently open to the full length, the fender needs to be removed and bent back into shape to allow the door to pass through. Still works just fine!

Truck is mechanically sound and very reliable so far, newer tires will last winter and another year,

Re-arsenaled with a black bolt and black phosphate finish, hasn't seen more than 100 rounds through it since it left Russia.  Really nice looking laminate stock for optimum appearance and strength.

All numbers matching.  Includes the bayonet, cleaning rod, even the butt stock cleaning kit is in mint condition!

If you follow these you'll recognize that a pristine '51 is harder to find than a lot of other years.

The 7.62 x 39 cartridge platform is functional for a variety of uses, affordable, and its recoil makes it fun to shoot for a wide range of users.
Isn't it time to add one of these to your collection before any other restrictions come down the pike?

The $470 price is priced just below what equal and/or lower quality specimens are fetching on Gunbroker these days so you won't have to wonder ""did I get a good deal?""

I have a lot of closeup photos, email me for them and I'll be happy to send them along.

I cannot say enough nice things about this gun.  

300 rounds all different types and weights with not one hiccup. It has mild recoil, it's accurate, it looks great, it fits comfortable in the hand, it's light...so why am I selling it?  I'm not going to be carrying for the time being and I've decided to trade up for something with a higher capacity magazine. 

I've gone back and forth 100 times, but I'd rather have a Glock 19 since it will be primarily a nightstand/range gun.  I'd prefer a RECENT 2012 Gen 4, but open to a Gen 3's too. Obviously, I'll be adding a cash to a trade - we can figure out how much depending on what you have.

The LaserLyte Laser Trainer Target records where a laser hits the target to save shooters time, money and ammunition. For use with LaserLyte's popular line of Laser Trainers including the original Laser Trainer, Laser Trainer Pro and Laser Trainer Cartridge, the Laser Trainer Target is ideal for novice or professional shooters and even instructors. It allows you to learn or teach shooting skills, such as unsighted fire, accuracy, grouping and trigger control. The Laser Trainer Target offers anyone the ability to practice shooting skills at almost any location, even a favorite recliner. Practice more often, become a more confident shooter and enjoy a lifetime of low-cost training with the LaserLyte Laser Trainer Target. The Laser Trainer Target gives the user delayed shooting feedback, just like the shooting range, so the shooter can concentrate on the next shot instead of the last shot. To use the Laser Trainer Target simply aim at the target and dry fire the weapon with any LaserLyte Laser Trainer. To display impact, fire the laser at the red display circle on the face of the Laser Trainer Target. When finished, simply dry fire the laser aimed at the red reset circle to begin again with a fresh target.

The caliber-specific LaserLyte Laser Trainer Cartridge that offers a revolutionary way to train almost anywhere. The Laser Trainer Cartridge is the most realistic training option in LaserLyte's popular line of Laser Trainers with the choice to practice tap, rack, bang or malfunction drills. Designed to match popular calibers the new Laser Trainer Cartridge fits inside the pistol chamber and features a firing-pin activated switch that indicates bullet impact with a bright red laser dot. For the cost of one or two visits to a local range, shooting enthusiasts can enjoy a lifetime of free training with the Laser Trainer Cartridge at the location that works best for them. Each Laser Trainer Cartridge easily installs into the firing chamber in seconds, works regardless of barrel length and does not stick out of the barrel. The Laser Trainer Cartridge activates for 100 milliseconds each time the firing pin strikes the cartridge. This modified cartridge is rimless, so the Laser Trainer Cartridge is not expelled during dry fire, which allows for tap, rack, bang or malfunction training drills. A hardened rubber plunger on the laser also acts as a built-in snap cap to protect the firing pin and two rubber rings on the laser help ensure a proper fit in order to best replicate bullet impact for accurate training. The LaserLyte Laser Trainer Cartridge requires three 377 batteries (included), good for approximately 3,000 shots.

here is the video of my 10 year old nephew shooting the pmr 30  http://youtu.be/g_L66SFCOO0


The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

I just recieved these new and are unopened from Amazon.  I knew what I needed but somehow ordered the wrong size.  I needed 1"" instead of 30mm.  These get real good reviews on Amazon and MidwayUSA with people using them in higher calibers.  I just placed another order for the same product but 1"" because that's what my scope is.  It will cost me $6 to send back.  I prob will end up with a 30mm scope at some point but if someone needs them now and either has $20 or a trade than they won't collect dust.

It's a 1/9 twist, Hbar profile, A2 front sight post and has a .223 chamber. I wanted something that shot the 55gr .223 ammo (that's frequently found around town) accurately and this barrel does the job. 

Barrel has ~300 round through it. Only selling to fund another project. 

Pictures show how I had the rifle setup followed by just the upper. 2nd picture shows the Matech rear sight still installed, it will not be included for the $200 price. 

Firm at $100 for barrel only. 

Firm at $200 for barrel left in upper receiver (Tactical Innovations), gas tube, delta ring assembly and triangular forearm end cap. 

Full Disclosure: Barrel may have a slightly canted front sight base. For the sight post to be perfectly straight I had to file a small amount from my upper's barrel index notch. I was never sure if the FSB was off or the receiver was out of spec. Regardless, it sits straight now but I wanted to disclose because I wouldn't want this sold to me not knowing this information.

The Ruger LC9 is a compact lightweight 9mm semi-automatic pistol made for concealed carry.

Ruger took everything they learned making the popular LCP pistol, and used that to create a 9mm version in this LC9 gun. The LC9 is a double-action-only, hammer-fired, locked-breech pistol with a smooth trigger pull. Control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. The Ruger LC9 features smooth ""melted"" edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing.

Company Background.

In 1998 Joe Roebuck recognized the increasing demand for a safe, simple to use, and affordable firearm due to political climate changes and most states enacting legislation to allow conceal and carry permits. Joe Roebuck has been in the manufacturing industry for 35 years, and chooses to use his talents as a Tool & Die Maker and Mechanical Design Engineer to design the CPX series of firearms. . September 2003, Joe Roebuck founded Skyy Industries, LLC now known as Sccy Industries, LLC to produce a conceal & carry firearm known as the CPX 9mm. The company's first offices and manufacturing facility was located in South Daytona, Florida and as of February 2010 relocated to a new 21,000 sq. ft. facility located in Daytona Beach, Florida, just a half a mile from the famous Daytona 500 speedway.

Contained in Sccy's new facility are numerous state of the art CNC machining centers of various types using custom tooling and programs designed by Joe Roebuck. The barrel, slide, receiver and all other major metal components are manufactured at the new facility. It was Joe Roebuck's vision that the CPX series firearms could be both cost effective and precisely manufactured to be as good as or even better than other name brand name products, without the high cost to the retail buyer. Sccy is now positioned to continue producing and developing new designs for the CPX series firearms. The CPX series envisioned has been successfully manufactured and sold throughout the United States using its own dealer network. Sccy's success is benchmarked by producing over 45,000 firearms to date. This success continues to grow with the current introduction of the new ""Generation 2"" CPX series. This year, 2011 Sccy will produce CPX-1 and CPX-2 ""Generation 2"" pistols and expand its national dealer base to a new all time high.

New customer service procedures are now in place to insure fast and personal service to both retail customers and dealers in need of warranty service. We wish to thank every customer and dealer for the trust and continued loyalty to the Sccy brand and products.

Here's what I have:

On top -- S&W M49 no-dash, nickel, really nice condition. .38sp of course. Purchased it a few years ago thinking it would be my carry revolver, but ended up being a safe queen. I don't know anything about its history (round count, etc.) except that it appears to have been fired very little. No box or paper, correct grips. Really nice gun. Old, pinned-barrel Smiths have become good investments. Snag-free design makes for easy carry. $425.00 FTF

Bottom -- S&W M36 no-dash. Gun has been refinished with Lauer Duracoat. OD & Black. I know the refinish makes it less collectible, but it sure makes it weather resistant and durable. Looks cool, too. Also .38sp. Great action too. Hate to part with this one, but I never shoot/carry it. $375.00 FTF

I'd love to sell either/both, but would really rather trade. I'm a S&W collector, so tell me what you might want to trade -- all I can say is ""no thank you"". Also looking for AR15 Uppers/Rifles, or anything else that goes ""bang"" when you pull the trigger.  Can go up/dn with cash, too

I live/work in the Asheville/Buncombe area of Western NC and would prefer a local trade/sale.  I don't mind giving/showing NCDL & CWP, expect the same in return."

807,http://www.armslist.com/posts/636807,For Sale/Trade:  Hitachi C10FS 10-Inch Dual Slide Compound Miter Saw,"Mustang, Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 300,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 30, 2012",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Think of the Hitachi C10FS as the Clydesdale of all the industry's sliding compound miter saw workhorses. It's tough, well built, and feature packed. One of the few saws on the market that bevels to both sides, the Hitachi lets you make compound cuts to the right or left without the hassle of transferring marks or repositioning stock--and the 10 amp motor is situated above the arbor to allow a wider cutting range. Unlike other top-heavy saws, the Hitachi remains well balanced and easy to maneuver--which, along with its smooth-operating blade guard, makes it a relatively safe saw to use. The saw's table allows a good miter range, swinging 57 degrees right and 46 degrees left, and the unique bevel and miter scale makes cutting crown molding a snap whether you're an expert or a novice.
We especially like how Hitachi's multi-V-belt soft-start transfer delivers power smoothly. The saw doesn't jump or buck on start-up, so cuts are generally safe and easy to keep true. The saw cuts 3-1/2- to 12-inch stock at a 90-degree miter, and at 45 degrees the saw handles a 9-inch cut. We also like that the Hitachi features adjustable plastic fences that give support when cutting small pieces close to the blade, but are a bit disappointed that the saw lacks a detent override, a mechanism that disengages the preset table settings and makes it easier to lock into angles close to 0 and 45 degrees."
