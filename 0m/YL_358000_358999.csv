The only reason I am selling this lower is because I had a custom lower on backorder from Spikes for my .50 Beowulf, after waiting nearly 2 months I got tired of the wait game and bought this one, the very day the YHM lower got to my FFL, I got a call from Spikes letting me know my order was ready and had been shipped, go figure.  As I stated this lower is unused brand new and I am listing it for less than I paid for it so my loss is your gain. As for trades I am currently in the market for a semi-auto handgun (nothing smaller then 9mm) Or really anything else interesting to add to the collection. Anyone in this market knows that ""good"" lowers are getting hard to come by, everyone has a long lead time right now, here's your chance to beat the wait and get your build started.   I will also trade the gun + cash if yours out values mine.

Blued/wood.  24"" barrel.  I will be keeping the scope in the pictures, but it will come with the Ruger rings.  The gun is in excellent or better condition.  The only thing is a small bit of wear in the bluing right on the hinge of the floorplate from carrying it, as you can see in the pictures.  It is very close to being as good as new.  Shoots very well and has accounted for numerous deer and antelope.  I have it zeroed at 200 yds, and if I do my part, it will hold 2"" or better at that distance.  It's an honest MOA shooter.  I like these models in this caliber because Ruger used the beefier barrel contour of the belted mags for this standard cartridge.  It's a good, stiff barrel and I believe that contributes to its accuracy.

Asking $500.  A brand new Ruger in this configuration is $680 at my local shop.  I just called there yesterday.  Granted that is for the newer Hawkeye update with the LC6 trigger from the factory, but I have zero complaints on this trigger.  I do have a Hawkeye in a different caliber, and there really isn't a heap of difference to me.

After speaking with someone from FN, more information has come to light about this particular Hi Power, and my earlier information was deemed incorrect.

This pistol is from one of the first production runs out of FN after Liege was liberated from the Germans, assembled from parts produced under German occupation but with all Liege/Allied markings (no German stamping of any sort). Based on the serial number, it was probably produced in late '44 or early '45. Smooth top slide, no rib, GI sights. Serial number is A60xx -- rare four digit with A series prefix.


I'm in no hurry to sell this as I don't really need the money or the Glock, this is just for my fun. 

Includes one serial number matching 13rd FN (extremely rare type magazine with split tongue baseplate), one non-matching 13rd FN OEM mag, and two 15rd MecGar mags, Spegel style grips and original WWII grips, Israeli 1911 holster modified to fit the Hi Power."

Included are 100 new discs in the Knight container.  They just need the 209 primer installed and they will be ready to go.

To cut down on what you have to pay me I will allow supplying your own paint/stain but won't be held liable for the quality of the outcome. If supplying the paint I'd suggest a high temp paint if you want the barrel painted

You can text me at 918-978-69five7. ( I only need the parts of the rifle that you want worked on, so wood furniture alone is fine, and I'd prefer you dissemble and assemble yourself)

I expect the materials to do the job, or cost of materials up front, however the extra pay won't be due till pick up.

Bought these loaders in the 90's for a Intratec 9 - 9mm and a Uzi I owned (they also work with, the AP-9, AB-10 and works with other double-stack open top mags). I never used them as I got rid of the collection before having a range need for them. Just unearthed them and haven't been able to find them for sale anywhere else, so someone will appreciate & use them (***Please note, magazine and ammunition are not included in sale---included items for sale are: (1)- Loader, (4) - C-3 clips, paperwork with loader and the VHS tape if if picked up locally, but for shipping, you'll have to pay a little extra***). Comes with 4 (yes, I know 3 are in the pictures, but I found the 4th-so it's included) of the loading blocks that hold 30 rounds of ammo each (= 120 rounds). You can plunge load a 30 round mag in 4 seconds! Better than 1 by 1 at the range and could save you some bucks on magazines, not to mention a sore thumb. 
If someone wants it shipped, payment of USPS $ Order or PayPal with extra 3% will work and actual shipping flat rate USPS Priority will apply.

Also included is a Crown Holster OWB kydex holster (almost exactly the same as the Raven Concealment holsters) and a Crown Holster kydex double mag carrier.

Additionally, I have ~150 rounds of .40SW Federal FMJ and 20 rounds of .40SW HydraShok JHP to include.

This is the rarer version (limited run) of the normally all black USPc. It is variant 3, meaning no safety and decocker on left side. It has never once malfunctioned on me. It has minor cosmetic wear thats only noticeable upon close inspection.

Even in used condition, this package is worth well over $1000. I am only asking $800, non-negotiable.

This pistol hasn't had 100 rounds through it. It looks like new and comes with 2 16 round magazines, one 13 round magazine and all the xd extras plus case. Still have the paperwork and bullet brass that was fired at the factory. My grandson is holding it, so don't be fooled by the size. I also have over 200 rounds of 9 mm fmj in various brands. I don't have another 9mm , so I don't need the ammo. No hiccups whatsoever. XDM .40 plus similar accesories is what I would like to trade for. Springfield will repair or replace any handgun made by them for life. No low ball offers or junk guns wanted. I just want to trade for a small .40 or .45 auto. Don't want the money. Just the handgun. If you send me junk email, I will not reply. Thanks and happy shooting."

This is not a trigger for a new shooter (Im a 16 year veteran cop and I dubble tapped it the first couple of times I fired it after the instal).

You can see in the photo what I paid for the weapon before all of the upgrades ($549.95). Now I am quickly approaching vacation time   and I have more guns than money.

Though I would love to keep this rifle, I simply can't due to financial circumstances and buying a new home and the cost of renovations. This H&K started it's life as a SL8-1 and was converted to a G36 (semi auto of course). This rifle has the folding stock, pistol grip, G36 handguards, and will accept AR-15 magazines. I have read and been advised by many folks that the conversion alone will cost around $2,000. This is not with the addition of a SL8 which will set you back a pretty penny itself. The gun looks great. I have not fired it since purchasing it and the round count is said to be low. There are very few blemishes on this gun. There is one slight blemish along the handguards that looks as if it was moved around in a gun safe. It also has a slight mark on the mag release. I will post a link to photobucket so everyone can view photos. If you would like to see more photos, please pm me. I am asking $2,700 cash for this rifle. This is a steal compared to what I have researched. This rifle will come with one Lancer Clear magazine. Here is the link to see the photos

So im curious to see if anyone else out there like me has been hunting for one and would like to make a deal.

I talked to Glock about this particular firearm they told me about 25k were made during the last 3-4 months of gen 2 production of those 25k only an estimated 2k were sent to the us.

about the gun itsself, all numbers match including on the box. has 2 10 round original mags and 2 new 13 round hi cap mags. fresh glock night sights ( installed last week) it does have some very faint holster wear and the main thing that bugged me is the trigger gaurd was rounded. That honestly is the main reason for me getting rid of it, I want one that is 100% to be a safe queen along side my gen 1 17. 

anyway I wall consider trades or cash offers,Cash price at minimum id probably take $550 for the gun with 2 factory mags and box ill include the extra mags at $20 a piece I also have some speer law enforcment 124gr gold dot hp rounds ill include for 25 a box of 50.

as far as trades in open to other glocks in 10mm or 45, 1911s, sigs in 357sig or 45. or a mini 14 ak 47 complete upper in 5.56 or 6.8 possible bolt action rifles in 308 300win mag or lever guns in 44 mag or 45/70. Im open to other firearms as well.

This one was a custom made pistol, as it differs from their stock model. It has the 7.5"" threaded barrel with thread protector and a raised rail to accommodate any thing you choose to mount. It is based on a stainless Ruger Mark III, with complete Volquartsen internals. It comes with the magazine, box and all paperwork. You will not find a nicer .22LR pistol. It would be great for targets, hunting or the ultimate plinker. 

With the options this would run you a little over $1,100. $800 obo takes everything (knife not included, it was just the only photo I had on hand). I also have a Burris 2-7x32 Nickle finish scope (#200298) and rings that can be added for an additional $175. May be open to trades so feel free to make an offer. Any questions please ask.

Have a fantastic PT 24/7 Pro in 9mm for sale. Don't want to do it, but the wife says I have too many 9mm in the house right now. Sooooo.... I'm getting rid of the wife! No, I mean the pistol, of course. I LOVE my wife. (Is she still standing behind me? She is? Rats.)

But seriously, this is a great gun. I've had it a few years and have perhaps 400 rounds through it. No troubles at all with either FMJ or JHP. No FTFs or FTEs, but plenty of FU Obamas!

$320. Comes with one 17rd. mag and I'll throw in the nondescript nylon holster it's been calling home.

Offers will be entertained but I will laugh heartily in the face of all low-ballers....

If you offer a trade; please make sure that it's not some weird 40 year old Cambodian remake of another weird gun that no one makes ammo for.  You might think it's cool and valuable but I can guarantee I won't.  I MIGHT entertain a partial trade on something in the .22 caliber.

SW5 clone gun modeled after the popular mp5 made by heckler & koch. I have fired 4 clips of 30 rounds through. Gun and accessories are in perfect condition, includes: 2 authentic hk clips 1 authentic hk mag couplar and 1 tactical case. All upgrades (hand grips, tachlights, rails, slings, stocks,etc.) that are up-gradable on a real mp5 full auto are usable on this clone gun. This is semi-auto, with a full auto receiver converted to semi and socom suppressor is non-functional, reason is to make barrel longer for legal reasons or hunting. Although not sure why anyone would want to hunt with it but makes a great range gun or home defense because of compact size.
Would like to keep for kids one day but a new transmission = need Cash. Local Sales only will drive to meetup halfway face/face only.
