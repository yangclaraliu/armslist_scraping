Shoots like a dream, I assume that if you are looking at this you know how accurate and reliable the CZ is but if you dont here is some info.. 
The pistol was required to pass a wide variety of tests to get NATO certified:

The pistol must be 100% reliable in extreme conditions, the following is a list of some of the minimum requirements.

Must be able to complete the following without failure:

4000 dry firings 
3000 De-cockings
Operator level disassembly 1350 times with out ware or damage to components.
Complete disassembly 150 times, this is all the way down, pins, springs etc.
100% interchangability, any number of pistols randomly selected, disassembled, parts mixed and reassembled with no failures of any kind including loss of accuracy.


Safety requirements:

Drop test
1.5 meter (4.9”) drop test, this is done 54 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked. Dropping the pistol on the butt, the muzzle, back of the slide, sides of the gun, top of the slide, in essence, any angle that you could drop the gun from. This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing.

3meter drop (9.8”) 5 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked, This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing.

After these tests are complete the gun must fire without service.

The factory contracted an independent lab to do additional testing on guns that previously passed the drop tests. These pistol were dropped an additional 352 times without failure.

The pistol must also complete an environmental conditions test: 
This means cold, heat, dust/sand and mud.
The pistol must fire after being frozen for 24 hours at –35C (-36F).
The pistol must fire after being heated for 24 hours at 70C (126F)
The pistol must fire after being submerged in mud, sand and combinations including being stripped of oil then completing the sand and mud tests again.

Service life:
The service life requirement from the Czech police was 15,000 rounds of +P ammo!
The pistol will exceed 30,000 rounds with ball 9mm.

Reliability:
The reliability requirements for the P-01 pistol are 99.8%, that’s a .2% failure rate. 
This equals 20 stoppages in 10,000 rounds or 500 “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) 
During testing, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired, this is a .05% failure rate, a MRBF rate of 2142 rounds! Over 4 time the minimum acceptable requirement.
The U.S. Army MRBF requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols with 115 grain Ball ammunition.

Heritage:
The P-01 is based on the CZ 75, the most used pistol in the world. Over 60 countries use it as the standard side arm of their Armies, National police forces, National security agencies or other Law enforcement organizations. No other pistol can make this claim.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01. CZ 75 SP-01 Tactical models come standard with 3 dot tritium night sights.

It only shoots when the gun is on safety. The hammer doesn't drop all the way when you pull the trigger and it's on fire. It is a single action so you have to pull the hammer back to shoot it. so that is basically a safety. If you come get it you can have it for $100. Text me at REDACTED or email me. No calls. Thanks.

Could be repaired if it matters to you, but it did not to me.  I purchased this on consignment from Green Mountain Guns who had it brought in from an estate from the original owner.  Their inspection agreed with mine that this gun has had low use.  My daughter used it for one year shooting in 4H and has moved up to an O/U.  She shot hundreds of rounds without a single malfunction.  Choke can be changed.  Includes Skeet and Modified.

I'm looking to trade my GSG-5P and my Mossberg 500 Cruiser for a rifle of some sort.  Coworkers are taking me hog hunting and they recommend I get a rifle chambered for 7.62x39 caliber ammo.

GSG-5P: This gun replicates the H&K's famous MP5 submachine gun but is chambered for the .22 high velocity caliber.  H&K threatenened to sue GSG if they didn't stop production so this gun has been out of production since 2008.  Whatever is out there is all theres going to be.  I put about 1000 rounds thru this gun. This gun is SEMI-AUTO. Comes with 3 magazines (1 mag holds 10 rnds, and 2 mags hold 22 rnds). Originally paid $480. 

***Note: This gun has a loose firing pin. Someone with a knowledge of opening guns and replacing the firing pin is required.***



Mossberg 500 Cruiser:  20 gauge pump shotgun pistol grip short barrel (18 1/2 inch). Never fired. Has a rack on the side that holds 4 additional shells. Originally paid $342.

Total amount I paid for both guns is $ 822.00

It was made February 2012, so the night sights are still fresh and bright (The front post actually gives off a lot of light if you sleep with the gun next to your bed.)

About me: I am willing to drive up to one (1) hour to meet you in any direction. From my location that means Alamogordo, or San Antonio (a little ways past Socorro), or Roswell. I have sold firearms on this site before. I reserve the right to determine our meeting place. I may also have another handgun for sale if anyone is interested."

I am the 2nd owner of the pistol, having received it from the first owner with less than 50 rounds through it (he just didn't like the way it felt).  I have personally put about 200 rounds through it myself since then.  Basically, this means that the pistol has really only just been broken in.

I have added a Hogue overmolded grip and also had the trigger worked on a bit so the trigger pull for the first round (double action) is MUCH lighter than normal.

The optic that is mounted is zeroed to the rifle. It does not go with it but I did not want to remove it for pics in the event I want to shoot before the rifle sells. I am willing to sell the optic if the buyer is interested. 

Don't confuse this with a run of the mill off the shelf AR-15/M4. It is a name brand competition quality piece. It has had some trigger work done. It is much nicer than the government issued M4's I use at work. It was manufactured in Windham, Maine prior to Bushmaster being sold to a larger company. 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this rifle. I am only selling it to fund my next project.

The unique 8000 Series rotating barrel channels part of the recoil energy into barrel rotation and partially absorbs the barrel and slide recoil shock through the central block before it is transferred to the frame allowing Cougars to achieve unusually low felt recoil.

Limited Warranty       Terms and Conditions

          Davidson's, Inc. warrants to you that if any gun sold by Davidson's ever becomes defective, Davidson's will replace the gun at no charge, subject  to the following conditions. This warranty applies only if Davidson's Supply Company sold the gun to the retailer from which you purchased it and extends  only to the original purchaser from the retailer. In order to be eligible  for warranty coverage, the original purchaser must complete the warranty registration online or return the  warranty registration card to Davidson's, Inc., at the address shown below, within 30 days from date of purchase. If no replacement is available, we will repair the original or offer you a similar model (to be determined at our discretion) free of charge. This warranty extends to any and all parts of the gun as originally sold by us, but does not extend to guns altered or rebuilt after their original purchase, or guns used other than for their legal intended purposes. DAVIDSON'S LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO REPLACING OR REPAIRING THE NONPERFORMING OR DEFECTIVE GOODS (TO BE DETERMINED AT OUR DISCRETION). WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, EITHER DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. To obtain performance  under this warranty, you must return the product to the retailer from which  you purchased the product and pay the cost of shipping the product to Davidson's.

    Davidson's will ship your replacement firearm the very next business day for all in stock items. You are only responsible for return shipping       costs to us (ie: getting the firearm to Davidson's through your retailer  we do not accept shipments directly from end consumers.) Handguns are   shipped out for next day delivery while long guns are typically received by your dealer within 3-4 days of shipping. If we do not have a       replacement or you elect to get the same repaired firearm back, your firearm will be sent to the factory or an authorized warranty station for       repair. If your firearm is repaired, the time frame until we return your firearm will be longer. Your dealer must have a valid FFL with original       signature on file for us to ship and a current account with Davidson's."

Limited Warranty       Terms and Conditions

          Davidson's, Inc. warrants to you that if any gun sold by Davidson's ever becomes defective, Davidson's will replace the gun at no charge, subject  to the following conditions. This warranty applies only if Davidson's Supply Company sold the gun to the retailer from which you purchased it and extends  only to the original purchaser from the retailer. In order to be eligible  for warranty coverage, the original purchaser must complete the warranty registration online or return the  warranty registration card to Davidson's, Inc., at the address shown below, within 30 days from date of purchase. If no replacement is available, we will repair the original or offer you a similar model (to be determined at our discretion) free of charge. This warranty extends to any and all parts of the gun as originally sold by us, but does not extend to guns altered or rebuilt after their original purchase, or guns used other than for their legal intended purposes. DAVIDSON'S LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO REPLACING OR REPAIRING THE NONPERFORMING OR DEFECTIVE GOODS (TO BE DETERMINED AT OUR DISCRETION). WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, EITHER DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL.

Handguns are   shipped out for next day delivery while long guns are typically received by your dealer within 3-4 days of shipping. If we do not have a       replacement or you elect to get the same repaired firearm back, your firearm will be sent to the factory or an authorized warranty station for       repair. If your firearm is repaired, the time frame until we return your firearm will be longer. Your dealer must have a valid FFL with original       signature on file for us to ship and a current account with Davidson's."

What a gun, it is basically a hand held cannon. But it shoots great. I really have not shot it a lot, but when I did, it is nothing like you would anticipate. Smith-Wesson did a great job at balancing the revolver to minimize the recoil. Women, it is not too much for you either.It is the most powerful handgun made, but it is not bad to handle at all. If you like power, then this is the complete package for you! Do a quick search, and you can see videos if you desire. IT will take the wild game down. It is my understanding, any animal. It comes with a Leopold scope, mounted on a Weaver scope mount, comes with a brand NEW Kodiak shoulder holster designed to fit with the scope mounted on the revolver. Also comes with some leadcopper bullets(12 X count of this type), and
500 S&W 300 gr FTX® LEVERevolution® (19 X count of this type), and also with a nylon belt(hip) holster, but the nylon holster will NOT work with scope mounted. The leather shoulder Kodiak holster is designed for revolvers with a mounted scope. Also comes with EXTRA front sight, and original owners manual, and original SW hard plastic case(blue in color). Any questions, please don't hesitate to email me. I am extremely firm on the price! But, will consider a trade for $1100.00 cash, and a 40 cal, or 45 cal. revolver, or pistol. Such as SW, Colt, Glock, Kimber, don't want some knock off gun. Again, please don't hesitate if you have a question to email me, but please be aware of the price, and only email if you are serious. Otherwise, you waste your time, and I just delete them. $1600.00 firm cash price, or $1100.00 cash (+acceptable trade). Thank you!"

These were banned last time Joe Biden wrote an assault weapons ban. That lasted far too long. This rifle is a collectors item as it was in customs at the time the ban took effect, so Mitchell Arms had to take off all the ""evil"" features in order to clear customs. Since the AWB expired, the regular wood and flash hider have been re-installed. The guns were remarked from M77 to M90.  The certificate of importation shows that this is one of a few thousand that were in customs at that time, and therefore this is one of the last batches to make it into the country.

Awesome AR-15, has been very accurate to me. I’ve only shot two mags through both components in order to adjust my sights while having much enjoyed it, no jams and I’ve only used clean new Ammo, no reloads. It’s a pretty light weight build, but it does not sacrifice accuracy for comfort. Around 5 lbs without a full mag.

Selling because I have to pay off insurance dispute, and I suppose I don’t really need an AR for home defense… $1000obo, price is negotiable! NO TRADES!

Once I obtained it I added a set of Hogue grips and new screws as well as broke the firearm and magazines down and gave them a thorough cleaning.

I'm asking $600 (obo) for the weapon, 3 mags, 20rds of SPEER Gold Dot hollow point ammo, 50rds of Remmington range ammo, a cleaning kit w/ Sig Sauer p229 breakdown mat, the factory case/grips/screws/literature, and lastly the medium sized range bag I had purchased.
