19,http://www.armslist.com/posts/922019,For Sale:  AR-15 ALG ACT TIGGER GROUP - BRAND NEW,"Puyallup, Seattle, Washington",$ 80,"Listed On: Sunday, February 3, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a brand new in the bag ALG ACT trigger group. I bought this to use in my current rifle but plans have changed and I will be buying a different trigger that is a two stage. If you haven't heard or tried these triggers you are missing out! They are super smooth and there is no grit like other standard AR triggers. These triggers are sold out every where and are difficult to find. This is the MFG discription of the trigger:

ALG Defense Combat Trigger - ACT
The ALG Defense ALG Combat Trigger (ACT) is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the ACT is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however it is sharper and the grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the traditional reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs.
**Tuned by Geissele Automatics**
Performance Advantages for the Shooter:
The ALG Defense ACT trigger pull is smoother and sharper than a stock trigger. This is accomplished by polishing the sear surfaces smooth and HardLubing the trigger components.
Sear geometry has not been changed from the standard profile so the high reliability that the stock trigger is known for is unchanged.
Trigger and hammer are made from true 8620 alloy steel military specification castings, correctly carburized, quenched and tempered for high surface hardness.
Disconnector is 1070 High Carbon steel properly Austempered into the spring range of hardness.
Springs are corrosion resistant and meet military specifications.
A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all type of ammunition.
Trigger and hammer pins are improved over stock mild steel by using 4140 Chrome-Moly steel that has been quenched and tempered. Pins are centerless ground to a fine finish and a diameter 0.001” larger than stock to reduce play in the trigger assembly while retaining a slip fit into the weapon lower receiver. Both pins are Nickel-Teflon coated.
Pull weight is above the U.S. Military minimum pull weight of 5.5lbs but does not reach near the upper limit of 9.5lbs. Generally, the pull weight is about 6.0lbs.
Advantages for the Armorer:
The ALG Defense ACT trigger is an enhanced standard trigger so maintenance and installation procedures are unchanged.
Trigger assembly parts may be interchanged between triggers, there are no matched sets.
As a trigger meeting the essential U.S. Military trigger specifications for the M4 Carbine, the ALG Defense ACT can be substituted for lower performing stock triggers while still staying in compliance with Unit or Departmental requirements.
Note about HardLubing: HardLubing is ALG’s term for electroless Nickel plating with an integral modifier to the base nickel plate. Either Boron or Teflon is used to enhance surface hardness, wear resistance and corrosion resistance and also create favorable tribological properties of the trigger components. Testing has shown that differential coating of the trigger parts contributes to the sharpness of the ACT’s single stage pull. The trigger component is plated with Nickel-Boron which has a high surface hardness combined with excellent wear resistance. The color is a pleasing matte light grey that may be painted on non-functional surfaces if the shooter so desires (such as the trigger bow that is visible outside the lower receiver). The hammer, disconnector and trigger/hammer pins are plated with Nickel-Teflon which combines a low coefficient of friction with good wear resistance. The Teflon impregnation colors the metal a mottled, greyish/green. Parts coated with Nickel-Teflon cannot be painted. Both coatings are highly corrosion resistant eliminating the oil seal of traditional phosphated firearm components."

the HD61 is a day/night indoor mini-dome camera that switches from color to black and white mode depending upon available light. The HD61 incorporates a 1/3"" CCD that offers 380 TV lines of crisp, clear horizontal resolution. The camera comes equipped with 20 integrated LEDs and a built-in 4-9 mm IR corrected aspherical Vari-focal Manual Iris lens for increased optical versatility and no focus shift when the camera switches from day to night mode. The 3-D axis gimbal allows versatile positioning and instant centering of the video image. In addition, the lens is separated from the LEDs by an IR boot mechanism which eliminates internal IR glare.

This is a very rare gun that our troops faced in Iraq.  You have to see this gun to truely appreciate it.  It shoots extremely well.  I was amazed at the accuracy of this gun, since it is based on the Kalashikov Design.  It has a Red Star Arms adjustable trigger, for custom tuning of the trigger pull.  This gun has Iron Wood Design Teak Wood, which is no longer being manufactured.  This gun comes with two 5rd Magazines, and one 30rd Magazine.  The quality of Two Rivers Arms guns is among the best in the whole U.S.  Serious inquiries only.  If you are serious, please contact me throught this website."

It also has a Hogue Fore End with stippled rubber finish for a better grip,  an L&M Light Mount and a Solarforce L2 Flashlight with a 1000 Lumen T-6 LED Bulb. It has a Tactical Brownell's Safety, which is MUCH BETTER than the original Mossberg safety. 
This is one of those rare shotguns which came with a pistol grip only from the manufacture, and was not offered with a full stock, so that it falls under a different category and can be shortened legally. Read the info available on this at Shockwave's site.
Along with this extra cool shotgun, I'm including a heavy black AIM Bandolier loaded with 60 rounds 12 ga., about half is S&B 00 Buck, the rest is misc. mixed.

Gun is in great condition was Law enforcement trade in I having put 100 rounds through it.
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm. Based on the full-size USP models these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.
USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reaches and grip circumference increases conceal ability and enhance shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame the USP Compact uses a narrow full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floor plates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing conceals ability.
Like their large frame predecessors USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified link less Browning-type action the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.
To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20000 rounds.
Easy to shoot simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable safe accurate and highly concealable pistol.
Features & System Characteristics:
•	Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
•	Grooved target triggers
•	Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity easier cleaning and longer barrel life
•	Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
•	Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
•	Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide
•	One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
•	No snag bobbed hammer
•	Flared recurve trigger guard
•	Choice of flat and extended floor plate magazines
•	Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
•	Ambidextrous magazine release lever
•	Contoured extended slide release
•	Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator

Gun is in great condition was Law enforcement trade in I having put 100 rounds through it.
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm. Based on the full-size USP models these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.
USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reaches and grip circumference increases conceal ability and enhance shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame the USP Compact uses a narrow full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floor plates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing conceals ability.
Like their large frame predecessors USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified link less Browning-type action the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.
To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20000 rounds.
Easy to shoot simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable safe accurate and highly concealable pistol.
Features & System Characteristics:
•	Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
•	Grooved target triggers
•	Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity easier cleaning and longer barrel life
•	Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
•	Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
•	Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide
•	One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
•	No snag bobbed hammer
•	Flared recurve trigger guard
•	Choice of flat and extended floor plate magazines
•	Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
•	Ambidextrous magazine release lever

This gun was one of two that were built for a customer in 1994. I am the second owner of this gun and bought it from the original owner, who is in the gun industry, in 2011. I would rate the condition of this gun at 98% excellent condition. I contacted the Springfield Custom Shop to find out the History of this unique gun. I spoke with Deb Else at Springfield and she sent me an email with the build date and approximate value in 2011. The owner sold this one to me because he only used one of the two and I received the one that was left in the safe. The following is a list of features on this gun: -Para Ordnance P-14-45 frame with checkering on the front strap of the grip and under trigger guard. A custom mag well was welded and blended to the opening of the magazine well. Slim custom wood grips. -Springfield Armory custom shop slide with serrations on the top and rear of the slide to prevent glare, flared lowered ejection port, and Bomar low profile adjustable sights. The slide moves smooth as silk. -Nowlin Match grade hand fited barrel and bushing, and full length guide rod. -custom tuned trigger job, 2.5-3 lbs. This is one of the nicest trigger jobs I have ever felt on a 1911, no creep, breaks like glass, adjustable, short reset. Awesome for double taps or fast shooting. -Ed Brown grip safety and ambidextrous wide thumb safety. -Custom commander hammer -hand fitted internals by custom shop -(4) 14 round factory mags from Para Ordnance Please email with any questions, I would put this gun up against a Wilson Combat, Ed Brown, Les Baer, nighthawk, or other custom guns. Super accurate and reliable, low round count through the gun. If you are looking for a custom 1911 this one is worthy of your consideration. Thanks for checking out my auction."

This rifle does use some AR parts like the pistol grip, stock and trigger allowing for them to be changed. 

The magazine on this rifle comes in a 5 or 10 round proprietary magazine. 

The innovative Noreen Bad News .300 Win Mag ULR provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform.

Weighing just 13 pounds, the Bad News .3oo Win Mag ULR is light enough and portable enough to serve as a patrol rifle, yet it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. The rifle’s custom muzzle brake and semi-automatic action significantly suppress recoil. With no bolt to manually work, the smooth action semi-automatic action allows the shooter to keep his head in the scope and his eye on the target for rapid, accurate follow-up shots.

In the AR tradition, the Bad News .300 Win Mag ULR disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reassembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle virtually seamless. The Noreen Bad News .300 Win Mag Ultra Long Range Rifle includes a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship for 1 year."

Specializing in un-stickying and polishing Mosin bolts, AK platform weapon repair, stock refinishing/restoration using traditional methods and 10/22 trigger jobs.  Just send an email for pics of past work and any quotes/questions.  

Thanks."

It is a PSA Lower with a Rock River 2 stage match trigger and Magpul PRS Stock which is adjustable for cheekweld and length of pull.  

The upper receiver is a slick side, and fits VERY tightly to the lower.  There is no wobble of any kind.  The barrel is a Krieger stainless, 1:8 twist, 22"" full profile bull barrel, threaded a 5/8-24 pitch with a Miculek Compensator.  The upper has a flat top picatinny gas block, rifle length MW quad rail and Harris bi-pod, and badger ordnance charging handle with the big tac latch.  

The scope is a 30mm BSA Tactical Mildot 6-24 X 44 with Side Parallax Adjustment mounted in a Burris PEPR.  It also has a fastfire style UAG Reddot mounted forward on a 1 o'clock mount...in case your shooting bench gets overrun and you need to go CQ.  There is a Viking Tactics padded sling with QD mounts on it as well.

Included are two 25 rnd mags a and 10 rnd mag, as well as a new set of Hornady Custom Dies, RCBS shell holder, 100 Hornady AMAX bullets, and about 60 pieces of hornady brass.  I also have about 180 rounds of Horndady AMAX ammo too.  

This gun is a tack driver.  I waited months and months on the barrel, and was not disappointed when it came.  I have not handloaded for it yet, but am shooting 1/2 inch 5 shot groups at will at 100 yards using the Hornady ammo off the bipod, and I haven't sandbagged it yet.  The recoil is so light you can see the bullet holes appear through the scope.

Gendel barrels and bolts where hard to find and on a long wait list BEFORE December.  I had about $2200 in this gun alone BEFORE this nonsense started.  I suspect it would be well over $3k to build the gun now if you can find the parts, and a long wait.  

I don't want to let it go, but too many mouths/chambers to feed.  Not interested in trades.  Price is firm.  REDACTED"
