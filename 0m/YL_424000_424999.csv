I don't have much knowledge of the guns, I got it from my father when he passed away.  It is marked Plainfield Machine Dunnelin N.J. with SN 18577.  It sat in his gun safe and I never saw him fire it in the 20 years I lived with him.  I believe it belonged to a Cleveland, OH SWAT officer before it was my father's.  I took it out to fire it in his honor and now I have cleaned it and put it in my safe.  I won't ever fire it again hardly and I'm not a collector so I figured I would give it to someone who either collects or would put it to better use than I.  Asking price is based on what I've seen other M1's in the same configuration listed for but price is negotiable.  I'm not giving it away as it has some meaning to me but for the right price I will let it go.  If it doesn't sell for what I want for it I will keep it, the value will only rise.

Parlor pistols and rifles (zimmerschutzen from German, ""room marksman"" or ""room shoot"") were popularized in the mid to late 19th Century, particularly in the Germanic countries, as a way to entertain guests, have family fun, and to increase one's shooting skills. Generally heavy barreled and often elaborately engraved rifles (zimmerbusche) were produced for clearly upscale clients. These generally used a Flobert (CB-Cap) cartridge chambered a few inches from the muzzle. Sometimes equally elaborate parlor pistols (zimmerpistole) were chambered for Flobert cartridges or simply used a percussion cap. In this country, a small, almost toylike parlor pistol was briefly manufactured by Remington in 1860.

Highly polished blue finish. Pachmayr's signature grips. 1-13 round magazine. Condition is used. Excellent condition. Minty shiny bore with sharp rifling. The finish is in 95% condition with a few signs of use but still very nice.  Low profile combat sights.  The magazine disconnect has been removed but will include the parts to reinstall if desired. This was done to greatly improve the trigger pull. Barrel, slide, and frame have matching serial numbers. One magazine included, although any magazines for the Browning Hi-Power will work with this pistol. Non-import marked. It has been a highly reliable pistol.

This FEG is a high quality copy of the Hi-Power, with all parts interchangeable with the Browning except the slide has a raised ventilated rib and the front sight is pinned to that rib.

I am selling only to offset the cost of my new 1953 vintage FN Hi-Power. Must meet face-to-face in Columbus, must be willing to show valid Ohio drivers licence and sign a bill of sale.

This Dan Wesson has definitely been used but not abused. It has some scratches as seen in the pictures below, it is a shooter and definitely NOT a safe queen. It also has the idiot mark that was put there from the previous owner. However, this has the ""Match"" barrel & shoots like a dream. The scratches are just cosmetic. This is one of the best PRODUCTION 1911's for the money, no MIM parts!

 Told it's worth about $1800 + by someone in the biz, but I realize that's only if someone is wanting to pay that.
 I think $1350 is a fair 'trade value' to get the ball rollin, but again, it's all relative.

It has 25rds though it, and for all intensive purposes is new cosmetically and mechanically.  If you looking at a custom, unique AR build this is it.  The 14.5"" barrel (16"" with pinned muzzle brake), Mid-Lenth Gas system, 2 Piece from gas block/flip up front are all things you can not find at a local store here.  Not to mention, no one in the area, or much of NY for that matter sells Daniels Defense AR's.  Even if they did, DD has already sold all of its 2012 stock for the year.  With the election coming up, and ammo/guns/parts shortage and price spike, this is the time to buy.

I have up for trade a LNIB Ruger Sr9c Stainless with Crimson Trace Laserguard. Have fired 600 FLAWLESS and ridiculously accurate rounds thru this fine little pistol. I received this new as part of a package, and just don't need another subcompact 9mm carry gun. Pistol is in like new condition and comes with everything it did the day it left the factory plus the crimson trace laserguard. The photo i have attached is a stock photo of course. The setup I am trading looks identical, and as I said, is in like new condition. I have over a +100 feedback over on Arfcom, so no worries.

I am in no need or hurry to trade or sell. This one is simply extra to my collection since I finally picked up the black slide model. I will listen to trade offers, but mostly seeking an AK style rifle or a FULL SIZE quality Railed pistol i.e..... Glock, XD, XDM, USP, PX series..etc.."

All three are Izhevsk manufactured and each has a different little quirk to make it unique. These have not been cleaned of the cosmoline yet. They'll go to you the way they came to me which means they each come in their own cardboard box with the following accessories: 2 ammo pouches, a bayonet, a sling, and the accessory/cleaning kit. Perfect for starting your own Mosin collection! All have good or better bores that just need some cleaning and none have been counterbored. I can and will check the headspace on each before you purchase it.

1. 1943 - This is most definitely a war time stock. Deep dark colored shellac with the usual slight flaking and wear you'd expect on the war time stocks. No refurb mark on the stock at all. Has an unusually beefy looking trigger and a few faint stock cartouches still intact. Kinda my favorite of the bunch because it has the ""been there"" look on the stock but the metal is in excellent shape.

2. 1942 #1 - Also a war time stock but much lighter finish and none of the war time flakiness in the shellac. This one has a few stock repairs. Lots of various stamps on the stock along the hand grips and a light circular cartouche on the butt.

3. 1942 #2 - This one wears a refurb stock with the [/] mark on it. Still has the protective tape soaked in cosmoline on the hand guard from the refurb process. A few stock cartouches (mostly numbers) are stamped on this one as well.

Let me know which one you're interested in and I can send detailed photos. Price is $125 per rifle and that includes the accessories as mentioned. If you're new to the Mosin thing feel free to ask any questions you have. I am a C&R license holder so I will need your info for my log book and will provide a bill of sale."

This Fine 17rd Capacity 45acp Tactical Pistol was Bought in late February 2012 from Gander Mountain in VA. The carrying case. has all items it came with including 2 nickel plated 13 rd mags, fired case, lock,Holster,Mag loader, double mag holder. It Has not been carried and been kept in box in safe. It has been fired once at the factory, and once at the gunsmith to test the Aftermarket Trijicon sights I have recently bought, I have  Fired it one time at the range with 1 box of 50rds Winchester SXZ training .45 acp fmj with lubalox coating. No problems arose from shooting. I like this type of ammo because wear and tear on the barrel is minimal. It was Thoroughly cleaned and lubed afterwards. I also bought an extra mag from the factory, and an APG arms +3 extended mag kit, Pachmayr Slip-on Tactical Grip Glove  for Full Springfield XD . Included also is a full box of Winchester SXZ .45acp 230 gr. Jhp. I need two quality pistols, I am low on funds so a little bit of ammo included in the trade would be appreciated. Preferred trades would be for a very good-like new condition Full Size pistol and a sub-compact pistol like a Ruger,Taurus,S&W,Glock 27,26,29,Para ordnance p10.  One revolver and one pistol might also be considered if revolver is .357 mag or higher. For full size pistol trades, I like tactical stuff or high capacity stuff. Might consider a masterpiece arms pistol, or AB-10 ,draco,Wasr-10 Please entertain me with trades. I am in Alexandria and not looking to travel too far. I really love this Tactical piece. I have not even begun to enjoy it, but I had to sell my sub compact to fund medical bills. So my necessity realized is a conceal carry piece and a range/home defense pistol or rifle.  I will entertain All your trade offers if proven adequate. 


I might consider a decent Assault rifle. 
I do not need shotguns!
