Recently picked this up in a trade and just don't know if I appreciate it as much as a ""Colt guy"" would, so its up for grabs. This gun is in excellent condition considering its 67 years old. Recently had a gun enthusiasts take a look at it and he stated he's only seen one other vintage Colt revolver in better condition than mine. He rated the finish at 92%+ and was impressed with how tight the cylinder locks up. He was also very impressed with both the single and double action trigger.

More on the specs; the serial (48****) puts it as being made in 1945, making this is one of the last of the first generation Detective Specials. It's 2 inch barrel, 6 round capacity make it a perfect conceal carry piece. It's rarity and beauty make it a perfect open carry piece! This lil' .38 comes with its original walnut grips (great condition, honest wear) two HKS speedloaders, a Bianchi IWB suede holster and 50 rounds of FMJ.

The Remington Model 1100 Competition is super-tuned for the competitive scene. By over-boring the 30"" barrel and lengthening the forcing cones, we improved shot-to-shot pattern consistency and made what was one of the softest-recoiling actions in the world even easier on your shoulder. The receiver and all internal parts feature a nickel-Teflon finish for the smoothest, most reliable cycling ever. It’s optimized for 2 3/4"" target loads and light field loads. Its optional adjustable comb can be fine-tuned to your shooting preference, and the barrel has a 10mm target-style rib. All these, plus a host of other upgrades, transform an already legendary design into an unstoppable force at the range.

More than 40 years ago, the Model 1100 forever changed the way American shooters viewed autoloading shotguns. It was the first autoloader to combine the repeat-shot versatility of early-century models with the sleek, modern lines and handling qualities of revered double barrels.
It's been a field-proved favorite ever since. Its superb balance, handling, durability and soft recoil from the gas operated action are the foundation of the Remington autoloading legacy.

Both frame and slide are 1943 vintage and were likely mixed while in service (a very common occurance).  I was told that the previous owner was an Army Captain in WWII and this was likely his service pistol.  The wear on all parts seems very consistent.

Gun is in really good shape. I just sighted it in. It has the bayonet and grenade launcher. This would be considered a field rifle, not sure if it was used in combat but it was greased up like it could have been. It has the serial numbers etched in the stock and on the barrel. I got on a sks kick a while back and bought two. I use my sks for deer hunting and only need one so Im selling this one.  Sks rifles are sweet, I prefer the larger 7.62 bullet over the ar15 .223, its also more accurate than a ak47 and with the longer barrel you will get higher velocity.   This is a cheap way to get a semi-auto rifle.  Ammo is $5 for a box of 20 at walmart. For those who dont know, its the same ammo as the ak47.

The bayonet can be swapped out for a bi pod made for sks .
You can buy a larger clip for this gun like a 30 round mag, I kept the 10 round since that is max allowed for deer hunting.
The scope is raised so you can also use the iron sights.

I'm selling because I recently got my G security license and had to pick up a 9mm for a duty gun. Now that I have my duty/CC 9mm, my XDS gets left at home... So it's time to let it go to pursue the next addition to the collection.

The barrel is super easy to install. My first one I put on took m about 12-15 mins' but on my last MAC it took 4 mins to change the barrel. Its just a super well built easy to work with and has all the treads you'd ever need to have. I have them on all my MACs and M-11's. I just order one too many this last order, my fault will end up your win!

This barrel is very cool because it allows you to have multiple threads on just 1 high quality made barrel. I have them on all my MG MAC and the first one i installed is still on and probably close to 24-28k rounds through it and still as accurate and has not faded any since the day it was installed. That's why I have them on all 6 of my SMG's .

For the barrel being sold, I opened the package to make sure it was perfect in aesthetics and to check the thread quality. At this time i felt the threads and they are very smooth with no rough marks. I tested the 1/2x28 threads with my AAC Ti-Rant 9 and it fit perfectly and snug on the 1/2x28 threads. I then checked my Bowers Group CAC Suppressor on the barrels other threads, the 3/4x10 threads and they fit tight and smooth as well. It truly is one of the best threaded barrels I own. I can honestly its just as good if not better that some of my several hundred dollar Jarvis Barrels I use on my high end pistols. If I'd had known about these sooner, I have no doubt I'd have them on more pistols.

It truly is a GREAT GREAT DEAL !

The 1/2x28 threads are standard on .22 as well as on a standard 9mm barrel so you can thread on suppressors and muzzle brakes.

This is a very high quality build and with shoot sub MOA all day long. Have never fired a steel cased cartridge through gun and only have 300rounds total though it. I tried several muzzle breaks to ensure it is best tuned to gun and the troy break creates no muzzle rise on this build. Soft straight back recoil. I put this ar together and have done more than 30 rifle builds/setups and have all proper tools, skills, and am very meticulous. The only reason I am selling is because I just purchased a Scar 17 and going all 308 for my rifle rounds.

This is an unusual operating system and it is quite unique.  This rifle has had the stock refinished as well as the finish on the rifle with a non glare coating which makes it rust resistant and very attractive.  The history behind this rifle comes from Sweden.  Originally the Swedish produced the AG42, which was a gas operated semi automatic rifle which operated very similar to the American Garand.  After the end of WW2 the Swedish sold their tools and equipment to the Egyptians as well as assisted them in setting up their factory to produce the Swedish Rifle now known as the Hakim.  

This Hakim is a good shooter and will come with a reproduction operators manual and a bayonet, which is a very pricey and hard item to find.  Also included is the gas adjustment tool which is necessary to change the level on the gas port depending on what ammunition you use.  The box magazine is removable and holds a total of ten rounds.  The rifle includes a sling and uses 8 mm Mauser ammunition.  When loading the rifle you can use the stripper clips that come with mauser surplus ammo to load the gun.  All in all this is a very unusual gun and a good shooter.  This rifle is in very good condition and a blast to shoot.  Feel free to ask any questions by contacting me by email."

-First off is the 7 inch long slide 10mm auto (very rare) with original box and 2 magazines.
-Next is a 5 inch barrel 10mm auto.
-Next is a 3 3/8 inch 10mm auto (also very rare. I have an extra 10mm complete upper to make twin 5 inch 10mm's.
-Next is the 7 inch long slide 45 acp (very rare) and the complete 5 inch 45 acp upper, so you can switch out and have the 5 inch model, this set has 2 magazines.
-Next is the 5 inch 40 S&W with one mag (pretty rare as well)
-Next is the 3 3/8 inch 40 S&W (Extremely rare) with one magazine.
-Finally one of the rarest Wyoming arms out there is the 5 inch 9mm with one magazine.
-I also have a bag of parts which includes springs trigger parts and grips as well as a hammer or 2. I believe I have enough parts for 2 complete receivers, less the receiver. Most magazines are Wyoming arms with the exception of a few.

So what you are getting is 3 complete 10mm Parker SS pistols, 2 complete 40 S&W Parker SS pistols, 1 complete 45 ACP Parker SS pistol, and 1 complete 9mm Parker SS pistol. Also you are getting a complete 5 inch 10mm upper (so you could have 4 10mm pistols. And a complete 5 inch 45 ACP upper to swap out with the long slide 45 acp pistol. All in all you are getting 7 complete guns with the potential of 9 depending on what you want to do. All Wyoming arms frames are the same so all slides with fit on any of the frames. These pistols use 1911 magazines as well.
I will sell the 10mm collection for 1500.00 or trade. The 40 S&W set for 1000.00 or trade. The 9mm for 500.00 or trade. and the 45 ACP set up for 600.00 or trade.

I am asking 2500 Firm for these very rare pistols. I started it off at $3500 cause of the rareness of the pistols now set at 2500 for whole collection. No bad guys so you must be legal to own, and have a CO ID showing you are over 21. I will only ship to a FFL. If these do not sell by December I am raising the price back up to 3500.00  If this add is still up the gun(s) are still available, I will take down the add when they are sold.

Thanks for looking and have a nice day."
