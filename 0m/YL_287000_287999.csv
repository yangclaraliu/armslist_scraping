Make: Colt

Model: Single Action Army – Black Powder Frame

Serial Number: 90581

Year of Manufacture: 1883

Caliber: .45 Colt

Action Type: Single Action Revolver

Markings: The gun has almost full coverage engraving, with few markings remaining. The rear face of the cylinder is marked with a “P”. The frame and trigger guard are marked “90581”, as is the backstrap. This number on backstrap looks to have been stuck over. The loading gate is numbered “1644”. The inside of the grip panels are marked “26 Colt Frontier / Single Action Army”.

Barrel Length: Measures 4.707”

Sights / Optics: The gun is mounted with standard Single Action Army sights.

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are aftermarket imitation mother of pearl. These grips are sound, showing no cracks or losses and fit a bit large to the grip frame. The grips rate in about Excellent overall condition.

Type of Finish: Hard Chrome

Finish Originality: Refinished, Applied After Engraving

Bore Condition: The bore is a bit rough and dark and the rifling is visible the entire length, but worn. There is erosion in the bore, but the bore is shootable.

Overall Condition: This gun retains about 95% of its re-applied metal finish. The modern finish shows almost no wear. There is very little visible pitting under the finish on the exposed surfaces, as metal preparation is good. There is pitting visible on the metal under the grips, inside the loading gate and at other internal areas where finish was applied but the area would not be seen externally. The engraving is loose, but deep and helps dress this old pistol up a bit. The Screw heads are worn but serviceable. The markings are clear where present, and some possibly re-struck. Overall, this gun rates in about Very Good condition.

Mechanics: The action does not function 100% correctly. The hammer does come back and the cylinder advances but the hammer does not ""lock"" at full cock. Pulling the trigger does drop the hammer. Its almost as if the hammer was rebounding about 1/4"". The trigger is pushed all of the way to the front of its slot with a strong spring. Perhaps this gun was reassembled incorrectly.

The gun has fired less than 500 rds and is in great condition. No wear from the holster as I have never carried it, it just lives in the holster in my nightstand. 

Price of $850 includes the gun, all factory accessories, the holster, and all 4 mags. I will also throw in 50 rds of Winchester Ranger. Other ammo will be sold/traded extra or accordingly. 

I prefer a F2F in Tennessee (within 100 miles of Chattanooga) but if I have to ship, the buyer pays ALL actual shipping, handling, and FFL costs/fees.

I found something i want but guy needs cash so i lowered price this is a steal ----------->FIRST ""G"" TAKES IT HOME !



AMT Automag III .30 CARBINE semi-auto stainless steel hunter Automag Kit.
I am the original owner of this handgun i purchased it in 1981-82 and have fired it around 200 cartridges to zero scope and millet adjustable target sites.
I cannot find any cosmetic issues it really shows like new being kept in its case nearly 30 years.
The original scope was a weaver 2x but it sports a bushnell troghy 
multi-dot / cross hair optic. the scope mount is detachable letting you bring the .30 carb back to a non-scoped version in a minute while the scope mount is factory fitted never looses its adjustment  when re-installed. This firearm has never malfunctioned and while at the range you need to keep everything of value behind the muzzle as it is really a 2ft. flame thrower using winchester hp's. Very accurate well beyond 100 yards with muzzle energy , ft. pounds and velocity exceeding that of a .357 magnum using optimum hunting loads available from wisconsin cartridge co. 
This package deal also comes with a U.S.A. MADE SHOULDER HOLSTER and spare magazine case with bullet loops. 
I really am not in a hurry to part with this AUTOMAG just seeing what trades might be out there. 
I am just kinda bored and want to try something different. I like 1911 platform handguns prefer 70 series colts. I will trade even up for a 
colt AR-15 sp-1 with forward assist . Smiths are also a passion of mine and really only interested in 4 model glocks, g-17 desert storm commerative , g26, g27 and g20-10 mil hunter with 6 inch hunting barrel.  Let me know what you have we can go cash+firearm or firearm of equal value or straight up cash.
This item is available for FTF. transaction with written receipt and wisconsin DL#. Out of state buyers this transaction can only be done through a Registered FFL holder at your expence.
Thank-you"

These rifles that are sporterized were done at the Arsenal many years ago-Not a home made stock cut job. These sporterized rifles have a better balanced feel to them than the long wood stock that went all the way to the end of the barrel. There is no case or anything else included except the rifle. The rifling inside and the end of the barrel is excellent like it should be. This rifle is a bolt action that holds 10-rounds and shoots 303 British cartridges-Please Disregard the tagged as 7.62x54

I would trade even up plus $50.00 for a Russian Mosin Nagant M-44 short barrel model. I do not want the longer version because i already have one. I am willing to drive/meet you if the distance is under 50 miles otherwise you need to travel too and meet halfway. I can buy a Mosin Nagnt m-44 from a dealer for $199.00 so i figure my 303 plus $50.00 is the best i will do.

If you maintain a food plot, you've already experienced the benefits of increased deer activity. This multipurpose Moultrie ATV food plot spreader with push gate allows you to maintain your land for maximum enjoyment. Feed game, seed and fertilize right from your ATV. As food plots become more popular, it's important to have the right tools and equipment. But for some remote areas and micro-plots, it isn't feasible to bring in heavy-duty equipment. That's where your ATV can help. Get on location and easily get to work by turning your all-terrain vehicle into the workhorse you need for your food plots.

The Moultrie ATV Spreader with push gate features a tapered plastic hopper that will not rust and will completely empty all contents. A shut-off gate allows you to change the opening size on the bottom of the hopper to help you distribute different feed types and regulate how much seed is dispensed.

The all-steel frame has a detachable bracket with a quick-release system that makes it easy to attach and remove the bucket. With a 15-gallon capacity for up to 100 pounds of feed, seed or fertilizer, you get 2 times the capacity of competing brands. The spreader includes a ratchet strap; a convenient wiring package that attaches to the ATV battery; and a heavy-duty abrasion resistant deflector shield that's easy to remove. Universal mounting brackets make it compatible with most any ATV model on the market.

Whether you're new to managing deer or have been participating in Quality Deer Management (QDM) for some time, an ATV food plot spreader that attracts and keeps deer is sure to help you turn your property into a feeding ground.

Durable plastic hopper has a load capacity of up to 100 lbs. (2x that of competing brands).

THE MR556A1
A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.

The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.

This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.

The MR556A1 is manufactured in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system.

The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled.

The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems.

Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life.

But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore.

Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy.

The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy.

A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance.

Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition.

The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product.

The MR556A1 rifle is now available. Suggested Retail is $3,295 (includes rifle, HK 30-round steel magazine, set of HK diopter sights, HK multi-tool, lock, and case). An accessory MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit will be available at a later date."

I recently added the Hogue grip and I will include the original Beretta plastic grips that came off of it too. 

Book value on this gun is about $475, not including the Hogue grip and the extra mag, so $400 is a fair asking price and is FIRM. Please don't waste my time or yours with lowball offers."

Made in USA

The Elite II guns are roughly based on the regular 92G frame, but have numerous enhancements. The backstrap of the frame is a couple millimeters thinner, and both the front- and backstrap are checkered, making the gun easier to grip. The slide is the ""Brigadier"" slide that was developed for our Border Patrol. It is recontoured with more metal in critical areas, making it stronger and a bit heavier than the standard slide. The extra weight enhances reliability and reduces recoil. The Brigadier slide also has front serrations for improved grip and a removable front sight. The sights are Novak low profile. The barrel is stainless steel and has a target crown. The hammer is skeletonized and the trigger mechanism has a bit of work to make it smoother. The frame is black and the slide and barrel are stainless, for a two-tone finish.

I found something i want but guy needs cash so i lowered price this is a steal ----------->FIRST ""G"" TAKES IT HOME !



AMT Automag III .30 CARBINE semi-auto stainless steel hunter Automag Kit.
I am the original owner of this handgun i purchased it in 1981-82 and have fired it around 200 cartridges to zero scope and millet adjustable target sites.
I cannot find any cosmetic issues it really shows like new being kept in its case nearly 30 years.
The original scope was a weaver 2x but it sports a bushnell troghy 
multi-dot / cross hair optic. the scope mount is detachable letting you bring the .30 carb back to a non-scoped version in a minute while the scope mount is factory fitted never looses its adjustment  when re-installed. This firearm has never malfunctioned and while at the range you need to keep everything of value behind the muzzle as it is really a 2ft. flame thrower using winchester hp's. Very accurate well beyond 100 yards with muzzle energy , ft. pounds and velocity exceeding that of a .357 magnum using optimum hunting loads available from wisconsin cartridge co. 
This package deal also comes with a U.S.A. MADE SHOULDER HOLSTER and spare magazine case with bullet loops. 
I really am not in a hurry to part with this AUTOMAG just seeing what trades might be out there. 
I am just kinda bored and want to try something different. I like 1911 platform handguns prefer 70 series colts. I will trade even up for a 
colt AR-15 sp-1 with forward assist . 
Smiths are also a passion of mine and really only interested in 4 model glocks, g-17 desert storm commerative , g26, g27 and g20-10 mil hunter with 6 inch hunting barrel.  Let me know what you have we can go cash+firearm or firearm of equal value or straight up cash.
This item is available for FTF. transaction with written receipt and wisconsin DL#. Out of state buyers this transaction can only be done through a Registered FFL holder at your expence.
Thank-you"

I am simply looking for something a bit more compact so price is firm....or trade must be a quality compact/subcompact (smith, ruger, keltec, glock, etc) in 380, 9mm or 40. I would even go for a quality revolver in .357 or ?? Face to face only in the Lafayette area with your valid IN identification and bill of sale. Please no BS offers/emails. Thanks."

There is a fine scatch in the stock about a third of the way down that came from moving in and out of the safe, does not appear to have broken clear coat.  And a slight rub mark, again from handling in the safe near the right side forearm that's barely noticeable and the camera won't pick it up.  Those are the only issues with this rifle.

The original Weatherby Vanguard and the subsequent VGD and VGX Deluxe models looked almost identical to the Mark V Deluxe rifle, and sported a very similar walnut stock, right down to the checkering, forearm tips, grip caps, line spacers, and recoil pads. The stock finish was high gloss and the metal finish was the renowned Weatherby high luster blue. These deluxe models were discontinued in the early 1990s.  The finish on the receiver housing of this particular rifle is plum which was not uncommon in the early models.

It is one of the lightest bows I have ever held along with the quietest. Draw length I believe is 28"" and weight can be adjusted from 50-70lbs with 80% let off. I also installed a peep sight and a d-loop for the release.

The Bow has a 3-pin fiber optic site that lights up, a stablizer, a nice drop away rest (better than the whisker biscuits). The bow will also come in a Flambeau large bow case. I will also include a Bow fishing setup with reel that goes for $150 at Gander Mountain. The bowfishing kit comes with mounting plate, the bowfishing arrows, everything needed for bow fishing. I will also include some expensive broadheads, they work awesome and kill very quickly. Also included is a Tru-Fire trigger release with a buckle clasp. Lastly, the bow will come with arrows, all carbon, some are carbon express( also have extra pointed 100grain arrow tips).

I am just looking at getting more into pistol shooting and could use the money. I am asking $375 OBO, which is very reasonable. Amazon still has the bare bow by itself for $379.

There is also a rear sight mount that is broken and the screws to take it off are stripped so it needs to be cut off, not a task that you need to go to a gunsmith for, could be done with a dremel, I just never got around to doing it. It is a well used shotgun for sure but it functions great and is a turkey killing machine.

This is a Para Warthog with a custom Cerakote Flat Tan Dark Earth coating, with black controls.  This is a sweet little 1911, that is easy to carry concealed and fun to shoot.  The biggest complaint about this gun is a FTF (failure to feed) issue that is addressed with new mag springs.  I have two mags for this with aftermarket Wolff Springs installed and I have never had any issue at all.  I am looking to trade for something of similar value.  I have had this for a few years, and looking to try something new.  Maybe 100 rounds through this pistol. 

Comes with original box, papers, two mags, and leather holster. Retail for around $800.00.  

From Para:  The PARA Warthog is the world's smallest .45 ACP, 10+1 round, semi-automatic pistol. It is unbelievably powerful for its compact size... only 6.75 inches in length and 4.5 inches high including the magazine. The genius of PARA is the reliability needed in a 3-inch 1911 style pistol, from its unique dual recoil spring system to its cone barrel lockup. The Power Extractor was designed for flawless feeding and extraction with the fast cycling time of the Warthog's compact slide.

It is all original, and it works perfectly. Bores do have some roughness to them, but then this is a 120 year old gun. The barrels are 30"" and are steel, NOT Damascus, and you can shoot this gun.

It’s interesting how the screw heads are engraved. Also, there is engraving at the muzzle although it is pretty difficult to see in the photos. The underside of the forend is marked ""12 44"" indicating 12 ga and 44 caliber. All serial numbers match, and it has the original butt plate, which is in good condition with the exception of some wear to the toe. It’s not broken, just worn.

This is a really nice example of an early gun, made with care, and lasting over 120 years. It is antique and can be shipped directly to you with proof of age.
