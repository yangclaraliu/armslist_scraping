First field test of the SR556- Sheridan, Wyoming. Ruger factory sponsored prairie dog hunt. We were privileged to attend the hunt, and an Impact employee was the first to take an animal with the SR556 rifle!

Function and reliability were 100%. The dog town we were shooting at had dogs out to 360 yards. All ranging was done using the new Ziess 8x binoculars with range and holdover function. Even with a low 10x scope, dogs were taken all the way out to 361 yards. Very impressive for any rifle, and even more so for a carbine!

We were shooting Hornady TAP ammo, 55g, loaded into the P-Mags that are included with each rifle. Effect on the targets was devastating. Multiple hits and complex gymnastics by the dogs were the norm.

All in all, our experience with the SR556 was beyond our expectations. The gas system gives the gun a softer recoil that a standard gas AR, and the chamber/bolt area was much cleaner that a gas AR. This SR556 is a keeper, and a really good value with all the good kit that is part of the base rifle.

Update: We have sold literally hunderds of the Ruger SR556 rifles. They are incredibly reliable and several of our customers report that even after thousands of rounds (some without cleaning) they have not experienced a single malfunction! 

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

If you don't know what a ""Piston AR"" is you might want to do your homework.

One is NIB unfired with all of the paper work etc.  It has an exceptional piece of wood  with lots of figure that has been refinished to remove the cut  from the stock.  Research the history of these if your not familiar- most of them have it.  The only reason I refinished it was because the wood is so exceptional.  I have cleaned  the Cosmoline out of the bolt and trigger assembly.  No rust.  No rounds have been chambered since it left Kimber of Oregon in the 80s.  Beautiful Rifle.  $750 cash

The other one is a blond and has less than a brick through it.  It is a very good shooter- sub dime size groups at 50 yards with Eley target.  I haven't put any high end match ammo but would expect it to be better than that.  This was purchased in 2006 and is not one of the ""Rustys"" currently being sold.  It has the expected, although very slight, cut in the forearm from Sargent slasher.   $650 Cash

I have the original paperwork from the CMP for both of the rifles.

I got an Anschutz 54.18MS so neither of these guns will get shot.  I'm only going to sell one of these and keep the other.


MORE INFO FROM KIMBER

Top quality U.S.-made smallbore target rifles have been a scarce commodity for many years. Winchester decided in the late 1970s that annual sales of the legendary Model 52 target gun, seldom numbering in the hundreds, were insufficient to justify continued production. 

Since then the 40X rifles made in Remington's custom shop have been the only smallbore guns made by a major U.S. manufacturer. German makers, especially Anschutz, have dominated the field. Most U.S. manufacturers have abandoned the smallbore target rifle, but a government contract helped Kimber. 

With the help of a big U.S. government contract, Kimber of Oregon has set out to change the situation. The firm won a contract to make 20,000.22 rimfire target rifles, all capable of firing .700"" or smaller groups at 50 yds. with target ammunition. 

With completion of government deliveries near, Kimber now is offering the gun to the civilian market. This rifle differs from the military version only in that the sight set is an optional accessory that most smallbore shooters will, no doubt, want to order with the rifle. 

The loading platform of the singleshot Model 82 is inserted in the receiver and incorporates the ejector. The action is securely fastened to the stock by a pair of heavy screws; one through the rear of the steel trigger guard into the rear tang and the other through the handstop rail into the recoil lug. The recoil lug is dovetailed to the receiver, which is grooved to accept the rear sight. 

Most of the Australian-made rear sight components are steel, with the housing and mounting bar made of a non-ferrous alloy. The mounting base secures to the corresponding receiver dovetail with two heavy clamping screws. The entire mounting system appears abundantly secure and allows the sight to be removed and reinstalled with minimal impact change. 

The adjustment knobs are heavily grooved for easy turning and are located at the top and left side of the sight. Each is clearly marked for direction and scale, allowing easy return to any previous setting. The adjustments are faithful to their claimed 1/5 minute of angle (m.o.a.) increments. No backlash was n6ted. 

The front sight is of the standard globe type and is made of a non-ferrous alloy. The 10 interchangeable inserts and the screw-in sight face and back are steel. The three post sizes and seven apertures that make up the front sight insert set seem adequate for shooting at most ranges and under varying light conditions. 

The safety lever is typical of Kimber sporting .22s and is ""rolled"" on and off to positive stops. It cannot be applied unless the action is cocked. The bolt handle is not locked when the safety is applied. 

The trigger assembly is fully adjustable for weight of pull, overall travel and sear engagement. The manufacturer cautions against making adjustments before reading and understanding the pertinent instructions; and then that adjustment be undertaken only by an experienced gunsmith or armorer. 

The three trigger adjusting screws (accessible after the barrelled action has been removed from the stock) are each provided with two locking screws. An inspection port allows viewing of the sear/trigger engagement. 

The instruction book states that rifles are shipped with triggers adjusted to a pull weight between 3.5 and 4.5 lbs., and that the trigger should not be adjusted to less than 2 lbs. Notwithstanding all that, the sample rifle tested at a very crisp 3 lbs., and no further adjustment was deemed necessary. 

The instructions further state that the rifle should not be dry-fired, but it may be uncocked by holding the trigger to the rear as the bolt is closed. 

The cylindrical 25"" barrel, factoryfitted with three sight bases (for scope mounts and the front sight) has a diameter of .928"". It has a 1 in 16"" righthand twist and is completely freefloated. 

The manufacturer warns against the use of all types of Short, Long or hypervelocity cartridges. 

Three buttstock spacers allow the length of pull to be adjusted between 117/8"" and 133/8"". The fore-end's accessory rail accepts the factory-supplied round hand stop. Fit and finish were in keeping with other target arms in this price range. All metal parts were well polished and nicely blued. The walnut stock had some visible figure and a low-luster finish."

The Good: This is a powerful battle rifle in .308 made by Polytech. If you do your homework, you will see that most Polytech's are very good with some lemons. Well this one is rock solid. It is recently checked out by a gunsmith. A friend (who is a former Navy guy trained on M14s) and I just sent a bunch of rounds down range with tight groups. Chrome lined barrel, clean action - this is a great gun. I hate to sell and will have sellers remorse until I reinvest money in a full auto Class 3 toy I have my eye on.

The Bad: No, you are not going to go to Camp Perry and win the 1000 yard service rifle competition this August with this rifle. You will need a $4,000+ rifle and the time and money for lots of practice for that. 

NOTE: I do not sell junk. I have a 3 day policy on returns for cause. (i.e. not because your wife just said no, but if something is wrong with the rifle that I did not know about I'll refund or make it right - my reputation is more important than any sale.)

About the Seller: I am a licensed attorney and longtime advocate of gun rights. We have a right from God to self-defense. The Constitution of the United States and that of Ohio provides political protection and recognition of these rights. The second amendment has nothing to do with hunting; it is there to protect us from the number 1 mass murderer in all of history - tyrannical government. Thus, every responsible family leader really should have at least one decent military rifle. 

Terms of sale: All transactions will take place face to face in my law office in Delaware, Ohio. You must be a resident of Ohio and not have any prohibition limiting your ability to purchase and own this rifle. Valid driver's license is required, valid Concealed Carry license preferred. I do not make copies of this information as I will respect your privacy. Credit Card transactions are subject to a 3% additional charge (this is a pass along cost)."

I pride myself in providing the public with fine ""Point Blank"" brand body armor with very limited wear. It has been properly maintained, and will serve your needs when you need it to. This type of level 2 armor is not readily available to the public, but thanks to my connections to private security and veterans, I can provide high quality vests which have been maintained properly to you, the citizen. These vests are nothing to sneeze at, they can stop a variety of rounds and shrapnel, with or without the trauma inserts.
       And did I mention they are concealable? That's right, fits right under your shirt: wear them to the movies, the store, or when you know you will be in a bad neighborhood. These high quality vests will accomodate all of your needs. Good luck finding vests like these for the price I am asking for. I have a large quantity and have reduced the price to make them all sell. I have made a few sales through Armslist, all with very satisfied results, and I think you will find I am a fair and easy guy to deal with. If you would like to talk to me personally, email me your number in the message box and I will respond quickly."

WASR: $550
Saiga: $700
First gun is a WASR GP 10/63. I cleaned and coated it with high temp engine enamel, and it's held up excellently to solvents, oil, and high heat from mag dumps. Have never had any issues with this rifle. Sights are not canted, and neither is the gas block. Only has a tiny bit of mag wobble, but I actually prefer that, compared to my other AK where the mags can be a bit tight sometimes.

The other AK I have is a converted Saiga 7.62x39, converted by myself. Doesn't have as many rounds through it as the WASR (only about 1000 or so), but it also has never had any hiccups. It's much more refined and polished in terms of build quality. It can be a bit tight with polymer mags like Tapcos or Bulgarians, but steel mags clip in and out easily."

I'd like to get a compact or full size 1911. Other compacts considered. No subcompacts! This one is just a bit much for me.
According to Para: ""The PARA Warthog is the world's smallest .45 ACP, 10+1 round, semi-automatic pistol. It is unbelievably powerful for its compact size... only 6.75 inches in length and 4.5 inches high including the magazine. The genius of PARA is the reliability needed in a 3-inch 1911 style pistol, from its unique dual recoil spring system to its cone barrel lockup. The Power Extractor was designed for flawless feeding and extraction with the fast cycling time of the Warthog's compact slide. The Warthog's match grade ramped barrel delivers incredible accuracy in a micro compact pistol.The frames have integral plunger tubes and grip screw bushings and ultra thin polymer grips."""

Instead, spend a REASONABLE amount on these mags to the point where you could actually resell them if you chose to. Thanks for looking!

Maybe an SKS but it would have to be decked out and come with a lot of ammo! I have two SK's so it would really have to be something nice.

According to the five digit serial number (including the zero at the beginning) it appears the rifle was manufactured in 1966.  This rifle is flat sided/slick sided (no forward assist).  It has triangular hand guards and a three-pronged flash-hider.  This rifle appears to be very lightly used.  I do not know the original owner, however I was informed the rifle was rarely shot.  Upon acquiring the rifle some time ago I had a professional Colt-Certified Armorer check the rifle at a gun shop in the Denver Metro area.  The armorer informed me that all the part seemed to be in working order and the rifle is safe to shoot.  He checked the gas rings which are in excellent condition.  The spring inside the safety mechanism was worn and replaced.  The dust cover door was replaced as the original had rust on it.  I still have the original door which will ship with the rifle.  No other parts have been replaced and everything else appears to be original.  The rifle also comes with a Vietnam-era M16 bayonet and a Colt 20-round magazine.  Although both items appear to be from the era that the rifle was built I am unsure if they are original with the rifle. They were given to me when I purchased the rifle and I was informed that the original owner always had those items with the rifle and the person I purchased them from believed that all items belonged with the rifle originally.  The rifle also comes with a modern zip-up soft-case (not pictured).  

After the rifle had been inspected I fired exactly 100 rounds of 5.56 caliber ammunition through it.  The rifle operated flawlessly.  I then cleaned it and stored it.  I regularly wipe the weapon down and make sure components are coated with a very light coat of CLP.  The selector switch has minor surface rust as well as the bolt catch.  Both are pictured and can view as to the extent of it.  
The buyer is responsible for knowing their state laws before purchasing this rifle.  This rifle will only ship to a FFL outside the state of Colorado.  There is a $40 shipping charge and will come with insurance.  The rifle is for serious collectors only.  Please feel free to ask any questions.

The reason I have been debating is because I cannot find one anywhere in the united states that is for sale. (not online or retail) This gun was released back in September of last year before the crazyness began, and I believe there were only 700 total sold in the U.S. (not exact on that one, you'd have to contact Springfield yourself and ask) But anyway it was developed with guidance from five-time IPSC World Champion, and 24-time USPSA National Champion Rob Leatham to be manufactured by Springfield. Here is Springfield's websight for you to view the specs (http://the-m-factor.com/html/specs10.html) If your interested then make me an offer. Maybe we can reach a deal. Thanks for looking & reading what I have to say. The gun retails for $8 - 900, and with tax it'll cost at least 1K retail. Please consider that before making an offer."

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. 


The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

This model has a ""shrouded"" hammer which gives the standard double action with the option of cocking the hammer back for that amazing Smith and Wession single action trigger. The shrouding nicely conceals that hammer for conceal-carry use and less chance of the hammer snagging on clothing. I have installed a Wolff spring kit to lighten the double action trigger pull (I have the stock springs if you want it changed back-although I don't think you will mind this smooth trigger now!!)

The revolver currently has smooth rosewood grips on it, but can easily be changed over to the other two grips included with this sale: the rubberized Hogue grip, or the stock grip. Also included is a Fobus ankle holster and a Galco ""tuckable"" IWB leather holster. I have original box and all paperwork-I am the original owner.

$60 in aftermarket grips + $100 in holsters + S&W638 = A pretty good deal!

I will sell just the revolver with the stock grip for $425.

I purchased new and added a 6rd side saddle and laserlyte/kbar bayonet. Less than 50 rds through it. Very unique looking, and is based off the mossberg 500 cruiser platform. Very fun to shoot and definetly a fun conversation piece. I don't hunt so would rather keep offers in the more recreational/sporting/tactical area. Not interested in ammo due to price gouging. But if you have a reasonable price on your ammo I may would take some as boot. If you would rather buy please feel free to send me a offer. But I would rather trade so there will be no ""asking price"". I purchased from Palmetto state armory and I added the shell holder and blade. There is no secret as to how much I paid. I bought online and went to pick it up there.So offer accordingly. Prefer text since its faster but I will respond to emails just a bit slower. I am in Hartsville. REDACTED, Jeff"

This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine.

The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance.

The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face.
REC7 Lifestyle

The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance.

At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance.

The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 hardcoat anodized. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle."

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/965998,For Sale:  KEL-TEC RFB'18 BULLPUP CARBINE NIB,"Chicago, Chicago, Illinois","$ 1,850","Listed On: Tuesday, February 5, 2013",Rifles,Kel-Tec                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"THIS IS A NEW IN THE BOX, KEL-TEC RFB. I HAVE NEVER EVEN LOADED THIS GUN OR ANY OF ITS’ MAGAZINES. RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included from Kel-Tec. The barrel on this model is 18"" long, with chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. It comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Kel-Tec accessories included are a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend with RFB Riser and the RFB Handguard Picatinny Rail (NOT Installed). Also included are Four (4) additional 20 Round Magazines. BUYER will pay actual shipping costs, there is NO mark up. Handguns can ONLY be shipped via FedEx Priority Overnight Service OR UPS NEXT Day Air. I will ONLY ship firearms to a current FFL (items will be insured for the value paid). I do NOT have a FFL, so PLEASE check with your FFL, PRIOR TO BIDDING, to make sure that they will except a firearm from a non-FFL. If not, there will be an additional $30.00 charge for me to ship it through a local FFL in my area (also, there is no mark up here, just my actual cost). FFL's can ship hanguns via USPS, so if it is cheaper to ship through my local FFL (net costs including their transfer fee) I will be happy to do this if the Buyer so desires. PAYMENT METHODS include either a Western Union OR a MoneyPak, PayPal (BUT an additional 3% to the final cost if you are paying with PayPal). If you have any questions, or concerns, please feel free to contact me at REDACTED (Text messages only), SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY, PLEASE."
