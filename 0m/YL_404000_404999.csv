Left to fend for yourself? These are the scenarios that inspired the LMF II. Former military man, Jeff Freeman led the charge to engineer this fearless new 10"" survival knife. And we field-tested with the troops. This knife is as adaptable as the personnel who carry it. Use it to cut through the skin of a fuselage. Or sever a seat belt. Or egress through the Plexiglas of a chopper. Plus, the LMF II does a slick job cutting firewood and building shelter. The over-molded handle successfully limits blistering. There is complete separation between the tang and butt cap, so the knife absorbs the shocks from hammering and prevents the shocks of electricity. Smartly situated grooves and lashing holes let the LMF II convert to a spear. The low-profile sheath facilitates movement, limits noise, works for parachuting, and attaches to a belt or MOLLE vest. The patented, integrated sharpener means edge retention in the field."

Green Lightning slugs are no match for white tail or mule deer. The green protective coating helps to reduce the amount of fouling inside the barrel. In testing, this slug creates a 5-shot group under 2"" at 50 yards. It's also safe to use with rifles or smoothbore shotguns. Penetration is very impressive too!

Why pay more for practically the same product?

With all the proper tools and equipment, we can build your standard AR15 carbine (or HBAR rifle) for as low as $640!!!

These are kit builds on Double Star lowers. Our parts supplier uses quality brands. Not only are my builds checked for proper head space by the supplier AND the assembler, but every build is test fired 30 rounds and include a LOADED 30 round magazine! 

We are currently in the process of moving and building a new facility, but we are still building AR15s at full speed! With the new facility, we will be able to ship builds to any FFL, but until then all sales will have to be face to face, private party to private party only!

We require a non refundable deposit for the parts only, and most builds are ready within 3-5 business days.

Look us up on Facebook under Legar Assembly ($640 build may or may not be listed), or simply email me for more information."

The Springfield Armory M1A is, for the most part, identical to the M14. There are, however, a few differences: Selector switch cutout in M1A stock manufactured in 1997 M1A receivers are made from precision investment cast AISI 8620 alloy steel. The military M14 receivers were manufactured using the drop forge process, which is more complicated and more expensive. Until around the late 1990s, the M1A produced by Springfield Armory retained the cutout in the rear right of the stock for the selector switch found on the M14. Springfield Armory has also omitted the ""7.62-MM"" caliber designator on the M1A receiver since 1991."

I'm looking for a pistol that hasn't been abused or scratched up. I am a CHL holder and have no problem with signing a bill of sale for your gun if that’s what you’d like.


The reason I want to buy a used PPS pistol, and not a new one, is because I want to know that it WORKS 100% reliably. Since I have to meet you in person to buy it, we might as well meet at a firing range of your choice. There's no sense in us meeting in a store parking lot somewhere, trying to handle the gun in dark shadows like two guys doing a sleezy drug deal. We can meet at a firing range out in the open, nice and relaxed. We can talk on the phone beforehand at which time you can tell me which ammo that you know your PPS 40 pistol works reliably with. I’ll provide the ammo, pay the range fee, and shoot 75 rounds through your pistol when we meet at the range. If it works like you say it does then it’s a done deal and I’ll hand you the cash. I own numerous pistols that can each fire off 75 rounds without a hitch, so hopefully somebody owns a Walther PPS 40 pistol capable of the same performance. As for out of town offers, I’m too nervous to buy a pistol from somebody out of town answering this ad without my first trying the pistol out....not too mention how many scam artists that there are out there who would run off with  your money if you would send it to them. Feel free to go look up my user name ""flitepac"" on both the Gunbroker and Ebay websights to see who you are dealing with.  I am not interested in any other used pistol offer except perhaps a used Kahr MK40 or PM40. In any event, it would be the same deal where I would meet you at the range. Thanks, Randall"

This one has very little use.  The rifling is good and deep and it is bright silver in color inside.  Not new, but not much under that.  The outside is blued.  It also has a high quality walnut stock with a lot of checkering and a nice recoil pad.  Black powders kick like a mule. 



I also have a traditions deer hunter.  It may have one day at the range.  It just can’t have anymore.  I think it has been fired but is almost to the point you’d declare it to be unfired.

I am a CHL holder and have no problem with signing a bill of sale for your gun if that’s what you’d like. 

The reason I want to buy a used Kahr pistol, and not a new one, is because I want to know that it WORKS 100% reliably. We can meet at a local firing range and I’ll provide the ammo and pay the range fee. If your pistol can fire off 75 rounds without a hitch, I'll hand you the cash. It will cost you nothing except a little bit of your time. I own numerous pistols that can each fire off 75 rounds without a hitch including my Kahr MK9, so hopefully somebody owns a Kahr  PM40, MK40, or CW40 capable of the same performance. Feel free to go look up my user name ""flitepac"" on both the Gunbroker and Ebay websights. I do business right and have a combined 15 years  100% positive feedback at both places. I'm not interested in any other pistols except perhaps a Walther PPS40 which I would offer $500. Thanks, Randall"

I also have a box of law enforcement buckshot, tactical hollow point slugs, and AA Winchester and a tactical sling with metal sling mounts.

It is mossbergs elite tactical shotgun. Persuaders used are around 325-350. Cruisers used are 375-475. This is the persuader cruiser. Used costing 525.00. For those of you that do not unserstand the difference between a 325.00 mossberg and a 500.00 mossberg, this gun is not for you. For those of you that buy the coolest looking budget accessories and do not care about performance, this is not for you. I bought this gun and its accessories to keep it as my protection for my home. I spared no expence. I researched what parts to buy and had professional gunsmiths install them.

Im selling because i just spent over 750.00 on aftermarket parts for my glock 22 .40 and it is now the home protector. This Mossberg is complete, i took the best and made it better.  And now its time for this baby to be someone elses protection and ill take on a new project. 

I dont expect to get what i have in thos gun back ( over 900.00) but i want to trade for an assault rifle. AR15, AK47, Plr16... something new."

It is an older 700, but don't let that deter you. This gun shoots 1 MOA. I shot several one inch groups at 100 yards with it the last time I took it out to the Stones River range in Antioch. 

Asking price is $450. If you meet the asking price, I'll include a hard case. If you offer me less, I'll probably wait for a few weeks to see if any better deals come along.

EMF's 1873 Great Western II ""Californian"" is manufactured by F.LLI PIETTA in Italy. These guns feature hammer forged steel barrels and frames that are drop forged and then CNC machined. Additionally, they have wider rear and larger front sights for faster sight acquisition.

This combination of traditional aesthetics with the best modern technology makes the Great Western II the most sought after, durable and reliable single action revolver on the market."

I will be taking this listing down soon and back into the safe the rifle will go. Below is a parts list of what exactly you're getting and what I roughly paid in total. Everything should be considered used but still in like-new condition (see attached images).

Sabre Defence barreled upper assembly with Phantom hider: $490
BCM Bolt Carrier Group (MPI) - Auto: $149
BCM Gunfighter charging handle: $45
Factory complete CMMG lower minus stock: $220
Magpul ETG: $20
Daniel Defense carbine burnsed loop: $25

The total for all of this came to about $950 (not counting shipping and transfer fees). I'm asking $700, firm. I'm pricing it to sell because I would like to make room for other things. But if I can't sell it at this price, I will hold onto it for a while.

Upper specs: Professionally built by PK Firearms (www.pkfirearms.com), it features a Sabre Defene CMV 16"" govt. contour, 4150 grade Mil-Spec per MIL-B-1159E ( CMV ) chrome moly vanadium barrel with mid-length gas system, 5.56 chrome lined bore and chamber, 1/7 twist, M4 feed ramps on barrel extension, F marked front sight tower, aggressive Phantom 5C2 comp/flash suppressor. This barrel assembly is built on a mil-spec A3 flat top. It also has a Bravo Company Mfg. full-auto M16 bolt carrier group (this is one of their older BCG, before they started laser engraving them with their logo), Vltor BCM Gunfighter charging handle (mod 3 - large), T-marked rails. Standard mid-length handguards with heat shields. Low round count (I would say 300-400 rounds of X-Tac M855 green tip with zero issues). Great shooting barrel. Very reliable weapon. No canted FSB, gouges, pitting, or other defects. The upper has the Cardinal Forge marking.

Lower specs: Factory built CMMG MOD4SA lower with Daniel Defense right hand sling attachment end plate, cleanly staked to castle nut. Mil-spec sized diameter buffer tube. Standard carbine buffer. STOCK BODY NOT INCLUDED.  Also has a Magpul enhanced trigger guard. 

Transaction details: (Legal residents of Tennessee only) We can do a face-to-face sale in a public setting in the Kingsport area. I have sold items via Armslist in the past and recommend using the Gun Rack parking lot. It's public, easily accessible, and having an AR-15 in a gun shop parking lot won't alarm anyone.

During the transaction I may ask to see your TN driver's license to verify state residency (to ensure compliance with ATF interstate sales rules). If you cannot provide identification upon request, I will not sell you this rifle.

No sales to felons, minors, or anyone who cannot legally own this firearm. 

I do NOT accept check or money order as payment. I accept CASH ONLY. Asking price is non-negotiable. I am not interested in trades or selling individual parts. 

Additional photos and information available upon request. Please contact me through the Armslist ""contact seller"" button. Serious buyers only. All sales are final.

Thanks for looking."

Wood does show a very little wear and bluing is dark and does not show wear signs but it has some marks and one light scratch as seen in the 3rd pic! Heck, it was made in 1956. Action is very tight and it has a light, crisp trigger. This gun is in very nice shape but it's a shooter not a safe queen! It comes with the Leather butt cover/shell holder in picture and three boxes of ammo. 3o 3-9o2-563o

Description:
The Beretta Px4 Storm Sub-Compact pistol is the most advanced sub-compact sidearm of its kind. Built around Beretta's latest Px4 modular technology, the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower. Available in two calibers (9mm and .40 S&W), the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact uses a very reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more compact and lighter weight system. A stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion resistant. The pistol adapts to different hand sizes easily with interchangeable back straps (included). An ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. A reversible magazine release button can be mounted on either side and can quickly be replaced by a smaller and larger size button (optional).

Doesn't have to be anything special, I just want one again had to ditch mine a couple years back to pay bills.

First up I have a 1911-A1 from Rock Island Armory. The gun comes with original case, stock 8+1 mag and a kimber 8+1 mag, would also consider throwing in a holster (I have a galco stinger belt holster, MTR custom leather inside the waist band holster, and a shoulder rig), the gun literally has less than 30 rounds through it, has been a daily carry piece and I'm required to carry at work, so in the three months I've owned it it has seen a lot of carry, but is in pretty darn good condition.

Second, we have an EAA witness 9mm. Gun is 100%, have about 70 rounds through it. Comes with original hard case, with 2 factory cleaning rods, 17+1 magazine. Was basically just a fun gun I picked up. Got out to shoot it once, and was very happy with the performance. 

Third, is a Walther PPS first edition in 9MM. The gun has some holster wear, would make a great carry gun, also fun to just go out punch paper with. Comes with one magazine, I would say overall the gun is 95%. 

Last but not least (by any means) is a Mossberg 500 with pistol grip with a shell saddle on the side. It's an older gun, I bought it used, but the thing is a riot to shoot. Never once have I had any problems with it. Comes with the shell saddle and sling. 

If you want more detailed pictures just hit me up.. but PLEASE no offers unless you're SERIOUS. I'm getting really TIRED of people telling me they want to trade, and when I try and set it up either they back out with out warning or straight up stop answering emails. 

I am willing to travel for the right deal, but I don't really want to drive across the state.. then again.. the right deal and I WILL TRAVEL. If you're serious email or text/call.. my number is 715 two one eight 6305. 

Willing to wheel and deal, but please don't try and screw me, I deal with guns day in and day out, but I'm not in the business of trying to screw people either.

Romanian WASR-10 from Century Arms. The barrel and other parts had 0 rounds through them when I purchased the rifle. Since then I have fired 200-250 rounds through it. The ammunition was mostly Tulammo and new brass Winchester. It was cleaned thoroughly after each firing to avoid any possible trouble with the Tulammo. I checked for front sight alignment when I bought the gun and it appeared fine. I havent had an issue with FSP cant on this weapon.

The barrel is chrome lined with a shiny bore. The trigger is a Tapco G2 and is very nice for a rifle like the AK47. It originally came with wood furniture. I replaced that with a polymer handguard and grip from Arsenal Inc. I also replaced the stock with an AKS-74 style side folder from Arsenal. The stock is great and locks up very tight when extended. An AK-74 style brake was installed to replace the slant brake. The 2 mags that came with the rifle were junk and were replaced by 2 Bulgarian mags that function flawlessly.

I will include all installed parts, the wooden furniture that was replaced, slant brake and all 4 mags (2 junk Romanians and 2 good Bulgarians)

Like the title says, this listing is for a like new Burris Fast Fire II in the box with everything that came with it new.  I bought it and the additional Glock mount to install on my competition Glock 35 race gun.  It is an awesome reflex sight for tournaments but makes the overall carry package a bit more bulky than I want.  This sight has been mounted through a total of 28 rounds fired.
I am asking $175 cash for the sight and the Glock mount but need a little more in trade value.  The Glock mount is an extra $50 by itself.  
The only trades that I know I am interested in at this time is a Keltec PF9 or P-32.  I will pay extra for more accessories etc but am not looking to go much more on the pistol alone.
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like some specific picture or something.

Fits 30mm tube. This mount is in like new condition. Dillo beverage entry tool included. 

The following is directly from the Larue Tactical website:

The Industry Standard.
The LT104 is the best mount made for attaching high-power riflescopes onto flattop-style AR15's, period.

The LT104 places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief.

The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.

Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.

Assembly and adjustment only takes a few minutes, then off to the range."

This Bushmaster has a lightweight barrel and is quite nice to carry. The barrel is about 11.5"" with about a 4.5"" compensator(compensator is permanently attached), it also has a Hogue grip. It does have scratches and some wear.  I think the muzzle brake works well to reduce recoil for such a lightweight rifle. 

The Tritium sights (sometimes called night sights, actually called low light sights) make this rifle nicer in darkness.

As an aside, in the long length of time I have been on this site, many mall ninjas and internet commandos like to comment that my weapons are worth less than my price (many times I hear this right before I sell which always gives me a chuckle).

If you think my weapon is overpriced copy and paste a link to this same model of weapon with a cheaper price. If you cannot articulate what you say, you are wasting my time, go back to the minions of inarticulate ""change, change, change"",  ""yes we can"" crowd.

It was purchased at auction and is supposed to be ready to work. May need a bulb or two but that's not really a deal breaker. Call or text for pics, lets make a deal

This is a rather hard to find Colt Python Hunter.

The high quality aluminum Zero-Halliburton case was also factory supplied along with the accessories (cleaning gear, cartridge box, etc). This revolver is in excellent-plus condition. The original blue finish rates very nearly 100% with only a very faint cylinder turn line. Judging from the cylinder face and recoil shield, it does not appear to have been fired! Perfect bore and action. Comes with all the original accessories including the correct owner's manual. The aluminum case shows some exterior wear with scratches and dings but the hinge and latches work perfectly. The original foam liner had turned to dust so it was recently replaced with a unit ordered from Zero-Halliburton. This is a great looking revolver and quite a find for the python collector!"

Brand doesn't matter, except no Llamas or Stars, I would just like it to be shootable so I can still have fun while building it. The finish could be gone, it could be a mismatched frankengun, doesn't matter.

Unfortunately, I need money fast and it has to take priority. I have had this gun for 2 years, but I haven't been to the range in 7 months. 

The stock sporter S-12s are going for $700+ right now. This is a hell of a deal. 

The gun suffered from the same ailments many stock Saigas do, FTE's etc. but I fixed all that with the installation of a new spring, gas kit, 5 stage plug and polishing the bolt. 

The gas ports have been resized and are perfect, and I passed the 200 slug break-in so the gun shoots whatever you put in it. 3"" Slugs or cheap wally world bird shot. 

My wife bought be a 20 rd drum for my birthday, I fitted it perfectly so its snug and secure and works like a charm. 

The bolt has been polished to the right amount to allow magazine insertion on a closed bolt. 

I have a collapse T-6 stock, and a Quad Rail with guards on it. 

I did not complete the trigger conversion because I have been waiting for the Kushnapup for 1.5 years. It's finally out and I can still get it for the sale price (if you buy the gun and want the Kushnapup I can order it for you at the reduced price).

I have more pictures at home.

**UPDATE**

I was flooded with responses within 20 minutes of putting up the ad on armslist. People keep offering more money, but I am not interested in getting into a bidding war that results in someone bidding more than they can afford, and not showing up, and excluding someone who actually has the money and intends to complete the purchase.

I am stopping the price at $1050, but the first person who contacts me with $950, and I believe is actually going to go through with it, gets it.

The other stipulation is that you have to be willing to come with a photocopy of your WISCONSIN drivers license, show me your actual license, and be prepared to sign a bill of sale.

Thanks very much"

NEW IN BOX


Certainly one of the most unusual-looking guns to come out is the Mossberg 500 Chainsaw. Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories.

I't a piece of arts and only worth with serious collectors, or CCW holders, who's tired of carrying the ample,popular handguns in the market and want to try different gun. Then, this is what you are looking for: The H&K P7
5 special points make this gun becomes the most safe and effective handgun as a concealed carry weapon, over the Glock, S&W, Sig Sauer and 1911s in my opinion:

1- The squeeze cooker allowed to carry the gun chambered. When the grip isn't squeeze , the gun in de-cocked position. Squeeze the grip, it's now cocked and will go bang when trigger is pulled. Otherwise, it won't fire ever. Simple and effective. No more worry about cocked and locked, manual safety(1911s), use de-cocking lever to low the hammer down, 2 different trigger pulls DA/SA ( Sig Sauer ) or carrying with anxiety about chambered  ( Glock and S&W )
2- The polygonal, fixed cold hammer forged barrel gives better accuracy in every shots, in defense situation, you missed-you die. And the low bore axis reduces the recoil and enhances the accuracy 
3- The gun is still functional even the extractor is missing or broke, because the special designed, the chamber is fluted, allowed the shell case  pushed out of the chamber by propellant gases. The extractor can be use as loaded indicator
4- The grip angle, which 110 degrees, gives you the most comfortable and natural POA. Just like you point you index finger at the target. 
5- The special parallel chamber-magazine designed of the P7 which insert the round directly into the chamber. That mean, the gun will feed any kinds of ammunition and jamming is a myth.
**Final**:
The concealed weapon is a tool, a friend who goes with you wherever you go and might save your life. Beside that, it's also a piece to show people around who you are. 
That's it, guys. Enough talking. I'll give you an HK Benchmade tactical folding knife, an HK flashlight and a sticker of the HK P7 pistol. The gun in your hip, the extra mag on other side, the flashlight and knife in the pocket and the sticker on your windshield. You are all set for any defensive situation "" DON'T TREAD ON ME ""
Gun comes with original box, manual, test fired target at factory, 2 magazines, takedown tool, brush, original German P7 holster, original HK flashlight, knife and sticker. You won't find any deal for cheap like this. The NIB P7 runs over $1400-1500 with no extras like mine.

The P7 is a German 9mm semi-automatic pistol designed by Helmut Weldle and produced by Heckler & Koch GmbH (H&K) of Oberndorf am Neckar. It was revealed to the public for the first time in 1976 as the PSP (Polizei-Selbstlade-Pistole—“police self-loading pistol”)

The decision to equip West German police with an advanced 9mm service pistol and replace existing 7.65mm-caliber weapons was prompted after the 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre. The new firearm was to meet the following requirements: chamber the 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge, weigh no more than 1,000 g (35 oz), the pistol's dimensions would not exceed 180 x 130 x 34 mm, it should have a muzzle energy of no less than 500 J and a service life of at least 10,000 rounds. The pistol was also to be fully ambidextrous, safe to carry with a loaded chamber and able to be quickly drawn and ready to fire instantly. As a result of a competitive bid the German police forces selected three different pistols into service: the Swiss SIG-Sauer P225 (designated the P6) and two German designs—the P7 (officially designated the PSP) and the Walther P5.
Series production of the P7 started in 1979. Shortly after, the pistol was adopted by the German Federal Police's counter-terrorism unit (GSG 9) and the German Army's special forces formations.The P7 was produced primarily by H&K but also under license by the Greek defense firm Hellenic Arms Industry[citation needed] as well as in Mexico by the Departamento de Industria Militar (DIM), as a sidearm for general officers and staff. The pistol was also exported to several countries

A schematic of the P7's gas-delayed blowback system.
The P7 is a semi-automatic, blowback-operated firearm. It features a unique gas-delayed blowback locking system modeled on the Swiss Pistole 47 W+F (Waffenfabrik Bern) prototype pistol (and ultimately on the Barnitzke system first used in the Volkssturmgewehr 1-5, which used gas pressures from the ignited cartridge and fed them through a small port in the barrel (in front of the chamber) to retard the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined—after the bullet has left the barrel—hence allowing the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech and ejecting the empty cartridge case.
The chamber has 18 flutes that aid in the extraction process by allowing combustion gases to flow between the fired case and the chamber walls, preventing the case from ""sticking"" to the chamber walls. The drawback of this system is that the breech ""opens"" slightly prematurely to allow the slide to initiate its rearward motion. The high temperature gases cycling through a tube located below the chamber area and above the trigger made the early versions of this pistol uncomfortable to shoot after the content of two magazines were fired due to heating. The advantages of this system are a simpler manufacturing process due to the absence of a locking system and a high mechanical accuracy due to the barrel being fixed in the frame; the barrel does not execute any sort of lateral or vertical movement during the operating cycle as with the prolific Browning cam-action systems used extensively in other locked breech pistols.
The P7's spring extractor is contained within the slide, while the fixed ejector is a surface on the slide catch.
The grip of this pistol features a built-in cocking lever activated by gripping the pistol handle. Before the pistol can be fired, this lever must be squeezed. Thus this lever acts as a safety. The pistol has an innovative trigger (with a squeeze cocking lever located at the front of the grip, beneath the trigger guard) and is striker fired.[8] Squeezing the cocking lever with a force of 70 N (15.7 lbf) cocks the firing pin. Once fully depressed, only 2 pounds of force are required to keep the weapon cocked. The weapon is then fired by pressing the single stage trigger rated at approximately 20 N (4.5 lbf) As long as the lever is depressed, the weapon fires like any other semi-automatic pistol. If the lever is released, the weapon is immediately de-cocked and rendered safe. This method of operation dispensed the need for a manual safety selector while providing safety for the user carrying the pistol with a chambered round, and increased the speed with which the pistol could be deployed and fired. The trigger and firing mechanism's method of operation (and the unique slide catch) were protected by U.S. Patent 4,132,023, issued on January 2, 1979.
The P7 is fed from a single-stack box magazine with a capacity of 8 rounds, which is held inside the firearm's frame with a release located at the heel of the grip. After the last round has been fired, the slide will remain open thanks to a slide catch that can be released by pulling the slide further back or pressing the squeeze cocker.
The firearm uses a fixed, polygonal barrel (hexagonal with a 250 mm twist rate) and a fixed notched iron sight with contrast dots that enable shooting in low-level lighting conditions. The pistol is completely ambidextrous and two-handed use is enhanced through the use of a profiled and enlarged trigger guard."

It has a shortened stock that works well for kids or small women.  I swapped out the pad on the butt stock for a Kick-Eez pad to reduce felt recoil.  It doesn't match the size of the stock perfectly, but can be ground down to match if you feel so inclined.  I still have the original pad too. 

The barrel was rusted at the time, so I cleaned off all the rust and painted it with a spray can of truck bed liner.  Mechanically, it works fine.  I'm not sure if the truck bed liner paint would come off with the cleaning chemicals used with guns.  I never actually used this gun because it was for my wife at the time and we got divorced shortly after I finished it.  

I wouldn't suggest this gun as a showpiece.  This is purely utilitarian.  I think of it as the type of gun you would just want to throw in the back of your truck and never clean or the type of gun you give your kid to learn to shoot a 12 GA.

This is a late production pistol that has matching numbers on the slide and frame featuring a fixed blade front sight, a v-notched fixed rear sight, a magazine safety latch and colt factory wooden grips with colt silver medallions having a serial number of 151XXX that makes it manufactured in 1941 according to proofhouse.com. Has the markings of ""COLT'S PT FA MFG CO HARTFORD CT USA"" ""PATENTED APR 20, 1897 DEC 22, 1903"" in two seperate lines on the left side of the upper slide, has the markings ""COLT AUTOMATIC"" ""CALIBRE 32 RIMLESS SMOKELESS"" in two seperate lines on the right side of the upper slide, the markings ""RAMPANT COLT STALLION"" on the left rear of the upper slide, the matching serial number ""151XXX"" are on the inside rear bottom of the upper slide and the left side of the frame, the letters ""X"" ""VP"" on the right front of the trigger guard and the number ""73"" on the left front of the trigger guard. The original colt factory blue seven round magazine has the markings ""CAL .32 COLT"" on the bottom side. This pistol and magazine action mechanics works fine with the upper slide locking up tight on the frame being in good cosmetic condition with the metal surface having normal handling marks and finish loss (as I am no expert in the grading of these just going on my opinion that defers from person to person), the bore has good lands, grooves and good rifling the entire length of the bore. The factory wood grips are in good condition with normal handling marks with no visual breaks, cracks or repairs, but please see pics and ask questions if there is something we have not covered as we are not experts in these type of firearms. This would make a good ccw pistol or good addition to your colt pistol collection to keep in your gun safe. Will drive to meet a reasonable distance to sale or trade this item to Missouri Residents FTF on a bill of sale or will ship upon receiving a clear payment and and a ink signed copy of a verifiable FFL paperwork for legal firearms transfer. Will trade towards Glock Pistols or Colt & S&W Revolvers. For more information please respond to this ad.

I bought this new-old-stock rifle Jan 2012...it's been to the range, never in the field. Comes with scope rings, without the scope. Blued with beautiful checkered Walnut stock. Includes the original box, paddle lock, and paperwork.

This is a 6.25 pound ultralight rifle. The MK II 77 RL is basically a Hawkeye rifle. It is a hunting rifle, not a target rifle...it carries very nice and sure beats packing a 9 pound rifle. Barrel length is 20"". Shoots 1.5"" groups at 100 yards...the gun prefers 180 grain Nosler Partitions over the 150 & 165 grain bullets.
