P95 series pistols easily field strip for cleaning, without the use of special tools, into five major subassemblies. Ruger offers several ambidextrous variations on the proven P95 series double-action design. Operating features on all centerfire models include a firing pin block that prevents firing unless the trigger is completely pulled and held fully back. Manual safety models incorporate a manual ambidextrous lever that, when engaged, prevents firing unless the lever is in the ""fire"" position. Decock only models allow safe return to their ""at rest"" mode when either ambidextrous decocking lever is depressed.

This 6” barreled Anaconda certainly fits into the desirable category. Chambered for .44 Magnum, the double action revolver has an all-stainless steel finish and factory-installed Pachmayr grips with gold-colored Colt Medallions. It has an adjustable rear sight, and a red/orange ramp front sight. 
Gun very clean with a few light scratches on receiver and some minor holster wear on the barrel. Overall condition about 90%. The factory Pachmayr grips show only minimal wear.

http://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/assault-weapons

The new proposed Feinstein ban calls for:

""Summary of 2013 legislation


Bans the sale, transfer, importation, or manufacturing of:
120 specifically-named firearms;
Certain other semiautomatic rifles, handguns, shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine and have one or more military characteristics; and
Semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds.

Strengthens the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban and various state bans by:
Moving from a 2-characteristic test to a 1-characteristic test;

Eliminating the easy-to-remove bayonet mounts and flash suppressors from the characteristics test; and

Banning firearms with “thumbhole stocks” and “bullet buttons” to address attempts to “work around” prior bans.

Bans large-capacity ammunition feeding devices capable of accepting more than 10 rounds. 

Protects legitimate hunters and the rights of existing gun owners by:
Grandfathering weapons legally possessed on the date of enactment;
Exempting over 900 specifically-named weapons used for hunting or sporting purposes; 
and
Exempting antique, manually-operated, and permanently disabled weapons. 
[POSTERS NOTE: DON'T BELIEVE THESE EXEMPTIONS FOR A SECOND. THESE GUNS ARE NEXT, YOUR BOLT ACTION HUNTING RIFLE WILL BE GETTING BANNED AS A ""SNIPER RIFLE"" the NRA, WHICH REPORTEDLY HAS A DRAFT OF THE LEGISLATION, IN IT'S MOST RECENT EMAIL TO MEMBERS IS ALSO STATING THAT THE LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE AS FOLLOWS ""Owners of other firearms, including those covered by the NFA, are permitted to sell them or pass them to heirs. However, under Feinstein’s new bill, “assault weapons” would remain with their current owners until their deaths, at which point they would be forfeited to the government"" SO NOW YOUR RIGHT TO DO WITH YOUR PROPERTY AS YOU PLEASE HAS ALSO FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE].

Requires that grandfathered weapons be registered under the National Firearms Act, to include:
Background check of owner and any transferee;
Type and serial number of the firearm;
Positive identification, including photograph and fingerprint;
Certification from local law enforcement of identity and that possession would not violate State or local law; and
Dedicated funding for ATF to implement registration.""



THE REAL PURPOSE OF THE REGISTRATION IS TO ENABLE HER TO COME BACK IN A YEAR AND PUSH LEGISLATION FOR OUTRIGHT CONFISCATION SINCE THEN THEY WILL KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. Also don't be fooled by the ""exemptions"", these are the same people who originally promised over and over that they were only trying to ban ""Cheap Saturday Night Specials"" Now they want to register and ban rifles, worth, in many cases, thousands of dollars. And, spare me the BS about public safety. According to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, in 2011, rifles of all types including ""assault"" rifles were used in just 2.55% of homicides, other years are similar. The numbers for the actual ""assault rifles"" within the rifle category, are so miniscule that the FBI UCR does not even track them. This is NOT about public safety. The goal is to ban ALL GUNS and they are going to do it in steps. This is not the only ban being proposed, there are independent bans on magazines, ammunition sales and numerous other things.
FIGHT BACK!

Also contact House speaker John Boehner and tell him not to allow a vote for any gun control bills. Boehner decides what bills get to the floor for a vote in the house of representatives. If they can't vote on it they can't pass it. This is a particularly good option If your own rep is hostile to 2nd amendment rights. Anybody can contact the speaker, you do not have to be in his Ohio district.

If you want to join GOA, JPFO or Grass Roots NC the links are below BUT, please keep in mind, as long as they are taking a strong position, which they are, the NRA has more lobbying power than all of these together.

Still has packaging oil on it and I changed the grip and hand guards for Magpul furniture.  I still have the box if you want it.  It came with a hard carrying case.

Specs and info:

One of our ALL TIME BEST Carbine models, the M4 Type features a distinctive Military Barrel Profile and Six Position Telestock – great for 3 Gun Match Shooting, Home Defense and Law Enforcement use.



The Bushmaster A2 & A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are modeled after our M4 Type Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individual officers (semi-automatic configuration with 16"" barrel).


 The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon.

Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling.

The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters.

The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage).

Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs.

The Bushmaster A2/A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are shipped complete with 30 round magazine, safety and operational manual, and carry sling.

Bipod w/rail adapter 
One 3 inch rail on the rifle and one extra 6 inch rail (not installed)
200 round 7.62x51 (.308) battle pack of ammo

I fired 20 rounds through the rifle to function test it after original purchase. The rifle has been a ""safe queen"" since that time. 

Price: $1,900 for the complete package
I would sell the package minus the ammo and bipod for $1,600
I could also consider a partial trade (ex. $1,000 + trade item of value)

Since the ultimate reason I am selling this rifle is to raise the funds to buy a tractor, I would consider a trade for a Ford 8N tractor (or similar) in good shape with PTO and 3 point hitch.

You can still get a good one without waiting months......
Here is a Les Baer Police Special AR-15 . These are crafted by the world renowned custom firearms manufacturer in Le Claire Iowa and are almost a work of art. If you are still looking for an AR-15 that is worthy of passing on as a legacy or family heirloom then this is it. I'll bet your friends won't have one. There was a several month back order when I purchased this. I removed it from the box, cleaned and lubed it, then shot two mags of ammo (60 rounds) to check the sighting and function. It performed flawlessly at clipped clay pigeons with the iron sights repeatedly at 120 yards. I then cleaned it and put it in the back of my safe until now. This comes with two unused 30 round magazines, the original sling, here has never been any scopes or cobbled custom grips mounted to it and I cannot even find any handling marks. Most of the accessories will be not be affected by the immenent ban and will be available forever so you can customize later. This may be your last chance to own a true AR-15 so don't buy a cheapie that you will regret later. You can always make more money but time is running out on these.
I have upgraded to a 308 and have painfully decided to let this go.     XXX If you are planning on using steel core ammo or some type of rapid fire stock, please do not contact me about this. XXX   REDACTED"

Currently, I have for sale or trade one of the nicest AK's you will ever hold. It should be said first, that I am an avid collector and shooter for 25 years now, and I am in the middle of consolidating my stocked calibers, and I have already been selling and trading my other 7.62x39's. THAT IS WHY I AM TRADING. I am not interested in gouging people like I have seen here and elsewhere. I was already scaling back calibers before this ""current climate"". With that being said, I have kept this AKM longest, selling off all my others before this one, including arsenals, poly's and others. That should tell you how nice this AKM is.  Moving on.....

Details:

Polish AKM built by the great Glen Ridle of Magnum Gunsmithing. (if your not already an AK guy, or don't know the relevance here, look him up, he is a Master firearms builder. This is NOT some crap Century build
The build started as an early Dan's amo kit with original CHFCL barrel.
Built on a NDS-1p  reciever(that is the premium reciever with correct P.G. plate)
Parkerized and then GunKote or Parkote if you will. Fit and finish are AWESOME
Laser build, straight as an arrow. (no worries of canted sights, gas block, mag wobble, etc..)

I have fired 320 rounds since the build, it runs flawless( of course), is stupid accurate( for an AKM), sights are dead on in the middle of the front sight.

It is tight everywhere it needs to be tight, there is no wobble or play in the underfolder like I had with my Romy, and poly, underfolder.

This is a TOP TIER AK (in case you are new or are not in the know)

The rifle will come with.
1. The Rifle
2. Original GORGEOUS Polish military furniture set including 2 Polish P.G.s
3. Black KVAR furniture set (cost me an extra $70)
4. military sling
5.Polish military 3 cell mag pouch
6. carry case with mag pouches (cost me $45)
7. ONE 30rd Bulgarian circle 10 mag (cost me $40)

Again, you would have to seek long, hard, and repeatedly to find a nicer true AKM.
As I said before, I have no interest in gouging people, but I am a capitalist and am happy to know, that because of the current""climate"", I can at least get back what I have into the package.

Price:
The rifle, with everything listed above will be $1000 cash or trade..not a penny lower. Low balls will be ignored, as I can just put this back in the vault and forget about it till the actual AWB passes.

ALSO.....as I said I am eliminating this caliber. So in addition to the rifle, I will also make available.

1. Seven (7) Euro Steel 30 rd mags in EXCELLENT condition (consider that, these are being sold for $25 a pop now)

2. One (1) 75rd back loading drum mag (BRAND NEW,NEVER LOADED)

3.One (1) hungarian 20rd tankers mag

4. 295 rounds of 7.62x39 ammo, includin Wolf, Tula, YUGO brass, and Hornady Z max

I want $300 for the above listed extras.( do the math, that is cheap)

I will give a cash discount for EVERYTHING listed for $1250 not a penny less

to purchase you MUST BE AN OHIO RESIDENT(SHOWING PROOF), MUST BE 21 YEARS OR OLDER, MUST SIGN A BILL OF SALE, MUST BE LEGALLY ALLOWED TO OWN SAID THINGS.

I'll put a few pics up if it lets me, but i have more pics for serious inquiries/offers

SORRY ABOUT THE BAD PICS. IT won't let me upload more or better hi res ones.

IF THE ADD IS UP IT IS STILL AVAILABLE...DO NOT email with is it available? questions.
ALSO The mags and ammo ARE NOT for SALE UNTIL the new owner of the rifle passes on them. If that is the case they will be sold or traded as a package

If I can not respond to you immediately, understand that I am fielding many offers and giving each the consideration it deserves

E.T.A ...also to ""clear up"" for some...There is only 1 rifle available...just one...my last one....The pictures show it wearing both sets of included furniture. Sorry some were confused!"

I AM WILLING TO EXPEDITE THIS ORDER QUICKLY TRY GETTING ANY OTHER COMPANY THAT SELLS AR STUFF TO DO THE SAME, IT WONT HAPPEN. 

Please call me at REDACTED if you are really interested. MAKE ME AN OFFER IF YOU DONT LIKE THE PRICE!!! If this potential ban is anything like the last one, this gun will be worth $1500 to $1800 in a few motnhs. I simply need the money now!

I have shot this rifle with this scope up to 200 yards without a problem. The farther out, I just set the red dot to a low setting. The rifle is set up and ready to fire!

The DT Sport has a 16"" light weight barrel with 1x9 twist (1.78 X's twist before leaving barrel), 6 position M4 stock, GM-QR1 Carbine-length aluminum rail system (QUAD RAIL) (CAR handguards with single heat shields come with but are not attached), and A2 flash hider, (2) 1/2"" Riser Blocks provide a steady and solid base for the 3x Barska Electro Red Dot Scope & NO MAGAZINE. Shipped with a Chamber Safety Tool in the chamber, clearly showing the weapon is unloaded.

The Red dot scope was chosen for this weapon and although it is a busget concius addition, I have found that it is solid and once zero'd in at 25 yards. Subsequent shots at 100 yards are easy, you just aim about 4 to 5 incehs below the target and adjust for any windage using Kentucky windage. I'm a novice and I can hit a paper plate at 100 yards 18 out of 20 times and a trash can lid at 200 yards 15 out of 20 times. That is pretty darn good for a $100 scope. BTW Barska does not sell this scope with the 3x magnifyer anymore only the 2x magnifyer. So Im glad I got one. THings are real hard to find right now for AR's that are on the cheap (but stable) side.

The rifle also has a JP Enterprises Trigger Spring Kit AR-15 3-1/2 lb Reduced Power installed. If you have ever installed a spring set like this you will know that it is not an invasive or very hard job to do. I will provide the original springs in case you want to switch back. The original springs were never used and in perfect shape.

The rifle comes with a vertical forward grip that is also a bi-pod. I love this addition to the rifle and use it not only as a vert grip but also for bench shooting, it is very stable, but easy to remove.

""Notes From AKBUILDER.COM""
The front and rear trunnion holes on these flats are pre-punched to help with the installation of the trunnions.
**Receiver flat thickness= 1mm (.040"")
**Material 4130 Annealed 
**Comes with bolt guide rails 
**Rails need to be heat treated. Then Welded to Receiver.
To use these flats you will need to have a 5mm and 7mm reamer. The physics of bending sheet metal make it next to impossible to have a bend close to a hole without distorting slightly. To solve this the holes on the flat in these areas are undersized and need to be reamed to size. 
The rails that come with the flats are pictured below. They have mag stabilizers on both rails to keep the mag from tilting and causing feed problems. Before installing the rails you will need to trim the mag stabilizers to match the thickness of the Mag you are using. (7.62x39 or 5.56x39)

I purchased this about a year ago as a project and did all the cleaning, detailing, and restoring myself. These are surplus rifles, so this one came out of a weapons cache and was coated in cosmoline. Its in great shape and shoots really well. barrel is in perfect condition, no damage, rust or pitting.
Caliber: 7.62x54r
Yr. 1934
Includes all original parts (sling, bayonet, oil/solvent container, leather ammo pouches, field tool, original butt plate), replacement rubber butt pad, and over-sized rifle sleeve.
Scope is a NcStar 2-9x32 extended eye relief (scout sniper setup) with covers. Extended eye relief is necessary as to not interfere with bolt function. The bolt is all original with matching serial numbers to the receiver.
Also, the scope mount is set over the top of the original iron sights, you can still look under the scope and use them, Or just remove the screws and take off the weever mount and use the sights as originally intended. 
Its a beautiful WWII rifle and in great shape.

Shot less than 50 rounds through this pistol.  Everything is included that came with the pistol - box, manual, lock, two 13-round magazines - and I had the custom adjustable match rear sight added (see photos below).

GUN INFORMATION:  The 21C has a vented slide towards the front and a vented barrel (towards the front also).  This results in a reduction of the felt recoil factor by 50% or more depending on ammo.  This is an exceptionally accurate .45 Caliber pistol, and as stated above - I shot less than 50 rounds through the pistol using both ball and HP ammo to ensure all was correct.  This pistol is a tack-driver and the custom rear match adjustable sights make adjusting your sweet spot exceptionally easy.  This is not always a pistol model that is readily available - so my asking price represents a bargain.

REASON FOR SELLING:  I've been collecting Glock pistols for a few years now.  I'm not using this 21C right now and it's just sitting in the box, so I'm putting it up for sale.  This pistol is in virtually like new condition because of the conditions I mentioned above (see photos).

PRICE:  $550 (cash only - please, no trades).

METHOD OF CONTACT:  You can reply to this ad, or better yet - for more questions, feel free to call me on my mobile - which is REDACTED anytime between 9 AM and 10 PM EST.  I live in the small town of Fuquay Varina, NC - which is 30 minutes south of Raleigh (near 401S).  PLEASE DO NOT TEXT - I'd rather you call.  The way I work is that ""first come, first served"" will be the standard procedure.  The first person to arrive at my doorstep for the sale, gets the gun.  Because this is a handgun, I'd prefer a local (NC) sale if at all possible.

OTHER INFO:  All NC requirements apply.  If you don't have a Concealed Carry Permit, you will need a Official Pistol Permit as part of the sale (and your NCDL).  If you have a CCP, then that and a DL will be required.  We will fill out a formal bill of sale so that a paper trail can be followed up upon if need be.

You can still get a good one without waiting months......
Here is a Les Baer Police Special AR-15 . These are crafted by the world renowned custom firearms manufacturer in Le Claire Iowa and are almost a work of art. If you are still looking for an AR-15 that is worthy of passing on as a legacy or family heirloom then this is it. I'll bet your friends won't have one. There was a several month back order when I purchased this. I removed it from the box, cleaned and lubed it, then shot two mags of ammo (60 rounds) to check the sighting and function. It performed flawlessly at clipped clay pigeons with the iron sights repeatedly at 120 yards. I then cleaned it and put it in the back of my safe until now. This comes with two unused 30 round magazines, the original sling, here has never been any scopes or cobbled custom grips mounted to it and I cannot even find any handling marks. Most of the accessories will be not be affected by the immenent ban and will be available forever so you can customize later. This may be your last chance to own a true AR-15 so don't buy a cheapie that you will regret later. You can always make more money but time is running out on these.
I have upgraded to a 308 and have painfully decided to let this go.  I am in Iowa but will ship to transfer through your local FFL    XXX If you are planning on using steel core ammo or some type of rapid fire stock, please do not contact me about this. XXX   563 676 8641"

614,http://www.armslist.com/posts/760614,For Sale:  New Custom Auto-Ordnance M-1 .30 Cal Carbine w/tactical set-up and five (5) 30-round magazines and more...,"Fuquay Varina, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina","$ 1,050","Listed On: Friday, December 28, 2012",Rifles,Auto Ordnance                                                                                ,30 Carbine                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"OR SALE: A new (never been fired) custom ordered and tactically modified Auto-Ordnance .30 M-1 Carbine w/ five (5) 30-round magazines, and one 10-round magazine.  This carbine has a custom foldable black tactical stock, bipod, custom top forward picatinny rail, a raised cheek rest, and a Fairfield tactical red dot scope,  Comes with box, manual, lock, and not shown in the photo - a new black carbine carrying case with slots to hold up to 8 magazines.

RIFLE FACTS:   As mentioned, this rifle is new...and everything on it! The rifle was ordered with the synthetic folding stock and the bipod.  I then went to a custom machine dealer who makes custom forward long top picatinny rails and that was added to the M-1 barrel assembly.  Thanks to the extended forward mounted picatinny rail, I then added the new, excellent Firefield tactical red dot scope (no getting in the the way of the bolt or expended shell casings).  The final touch was adding the cheek riser mount (which does not interfere with the folding stock - see photos).  You also have a total of 6 magazines - five of which are the 30-round variety, and one 10-rounder.  30 Cal ball ammo is easy to find in bulk - whether via Cheaper than Dirt, or other outlets.  And it's a fun round to shoot also.

REASON FOR SELLING:  I ordered this custom setup 6 months ago (I've been a collector) and had it outfitted for tactical use (sorry - I'm a retired Marine and I can't seem to get that ""tactical"" viewpoint out of my mind).  But what has occurred is that I wound up never using it and my wife basically gave me an ultimatum to ""thin out"" my collection, so I'm parting with this rifle and am selling it for $150 less than what I paid (overall). 

PRICE:  $1050 (Cash only) - please, no trades.  

METHOD OF CONTACT: You can reply to this ad, or better yet - for more questions, feel free to call me on my mobile - which is REDACTED anytime between 9 AM and 10 PM EST. I live in the small town of Fuquay Varina, NC - which is 30 minutes south of Raleigh (near 401S). PLEASE DO NOT TEXT - I'd rather you call. The way I work is that ""first come, first served"" will be the standard procedure. The first person to arrive at my doorstep for the sale, gets the gun. I prefer local NC sales - but will consider out of state sales (but you will pay for all shipping/insurance costs).

OTHER INFO: All NC requirements apply. Will fill out a formal bill of sale in the event that a paper trail needs to be followed-up on.

I bought this new a few weeks ago and have apx 200-300 rounds through it. It comes with 6 PMAGs, 2 black, 4 Olive. 2 of the Olive ones have not been opened, the others were used for 2 range trips. Also includes 240 rounds of .223 (6 boxes & 120 rd in the mags).

Yes, I know the price is high. If you have been shopping for an AR in the past 2 weeks, you know why.  No one has ARs or PMAGs in stock and .223 is in short supply. Feinstein has said her AWB will grandfather currently owned rifles, so get it while you still can.

I am not entertaining offers or trades.  First $1800 cash gets the package."

I have been talked into getting rid of firearms by family considering I have some bills. My brother just sold his AK to a family man and it did touch my heart. I am not a greedy person but if I am going to sell this rifle, I want to make it worth it because I will probably never get one to replace it.

I hate selling my guns but if I can sell for this amount I am asking, it will be worth parting. The AMMUNITION will not be included, but if you are local, then we can negotiate. I may have 100-200 rounds. Not sure.

The AK's condition is barely used. I took it to the range and shot slowly for about an hour. Estimated 60 rounds. No more than 80 rounds! The bolt has been polished. The grip is HOGUE. I have small hands and it grips very nice. The hogue grip was never used. The mags are various countries. One has been painted. All have normal wear since they are surplus. Only two have been loaded. Also included is a 10 rounder haha.

I will include the side mount for optics since I would no longer have a use for it. 
I will only deal locally and you must provide CHL and Drivers license. 
Thanks for reading.

961,http://www.armslist.com/posts/760961,For Sale:  Custom Built Sniper Rifle - Never Fired - .5 MOA Accuracy Estimate,"Northwest Suburbs, Illinois, United States","$ 1,750","Listed On: Monday, January 21, 2013",Rifles,Norinco                                                                                ,30-06 Springfield                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"For sale is a custom sniper rifle that has been worked on by some of the finest smiths in the business.

It started life as a Remington 700 Long Action (like what the USMC and Army use). Then, a custom barrel (I think it was Shilen blank) was made by Ernie Stallman of Badger Barrels (Now Wilson Arms Company). Ernie made the long range match rifles for all the custom makers and also supplied barrels to the military and olympians. The barrel is an extra heavy bull barrel that is 26"" long. Ernie's team hand lapped the barrel and picked an ideal twist rate for the length of the gun.

I then had the gun chambered in .30-06 for a couple of reasons. #1, many nations where you may wish to shoot this gun do not allow military rounds like .308 and .338 lapua (e.g. Mexico, Central America, Some areas of Africa) but they do allow .30-06. #2, Cabelas and the big suppliers have limited a few boxes per customer on the following ammo types .308, 5.56, .40, and 9mm. Therefore, 30-06 is still plentiful and that was my thinking when it was built ten years ago.

After the gun barrel was chambered by Mark Krebs (world famous owner of Krebs Custom, the finest tactical gun builder in America), the gun had its action tuned, trigger tuned and everything completely worked over like a Swiss Watch. A badger ordnance custom bolt knob was also installed by Krebs. Lastly, the gun was covered in HK black wear resistant finish as well.

The gun was then installed into a choate ultimate sniper stock that has an aluminum bedding in it and is fully adjustable for all shooters length of pull. 

The gun has a picatinny top mount installed as well.

The gun was made in about 2001 and has never been fired, much less broken in. Mark Krebs stated he believes the gun will be Sub-MOA around .5"" at 100 yards when I picked the gun up from him. 

I also have a blackhawk tactial drag bag / shooting mat for it and a blackhawk scope cover (but no scope) A night vision scope is pictured with the gun but is not included.

Price for the gun with the blackhawk case ($400 cost) and scope cover ($60) is NOW Reduced $1750. I have about $4000 wrapped up into this gun and I realize I'll never get it out of it. 

I'd consider a trade for at least quantity 2 ARs or AKs but nothing else interests me.
