It shoots great and has only had 3 or 4 mags through it. i have 4 of the 40rd mags but one of them doesnt fit right and is a PITA. These mags sell for $50+ when you can find them and the rifles only ships with one or two depending on who you buy it from.  The only reason I am willing to part with it is because i would like an M4 pattern AR15. I have all the equipment i used on my M4 in the Army and id like to set it up the same as i carried it overseas. Im not posting a price because of the ridiculous things happening in the firearms industry, so i would prefer not to sell it and rip someone off. I would prefer to trade for an M4 pattern AR15. I can throw in cash depending on what rifle you want to trade.

This is a quality gun, identical to the Russian, not a cheap Hungarian.  If you check the completed auctions on Gunbroker.com, you'll see that these guns have been selling anywhere from $425 to $800 - not my opinion, but Gunbroker.com FACT.  I have reduced the price to $350 because I would really rather sell the gun locally rather than have to ship it, but I have advertised it on Gunbroker, and if I have a bid before I have an ArmsList offer, I will remove the gun from ArmsList - so buy now if you are interested.  This gun is PRICED TO SELL and is a good investment gun.  Minor bluing wear around muzzle from holster carry.  Great carry gun.  Cash only, no trades. Face to face only for local sale.  I have a paper trail on this gun, so ID is required and buyer must sign a receipt acknowledging purchase.  You must be 21 years old or older.  I can demonstrate the gun near my house (daylight hours only), or I will be willing to travel in a 25 mile radius from the Mobile, AL airport to meet with you for the sale, in a public parking lot.  West Mobile area.  I am not set up to send or receive telephonic text messages. $350."

When I first picked it up it came with a composite factory stock with no pistol grip, since then I have attached an adjustable stock with a pistol grip. 

This rifle also comes with 2 10 round magazines. 30+ rounders are typically hard to come by at a retail store however there are quite a few after market online dealers."

This is a brand new, handmade leather kydex beltslide for the Springfield XDs handgun. 

This holster is for right handed draw.

This beltslide holster features a high quality leather back, kydex retention front, and double capped rivets.  The holster is designed to be used with a 1 1/2"" belt or smaller belt.  For the most secure fit, thread the belt through the front of the holster, then through a belt loop, then out the back of the holster.  This will help secure the holster tighter to your side.  This holster is designed to be worn outside the waist.  It also features a sweat guard to keep the slide from contacting your skin when concealed.  This holster features a medium level of retention.  The retention will hold the handgun securely while allowing  an easy draw.  This holster also has a finished back side for a nicer look and burnished edges for more comfortable wear.  The holster has a forward cant to make drawing easier and make the holster more concealable.  All holsters are checked to ensure you can achieve a solid combat grip on the draw.  The leather and kydex material are also cut away from the magazine release to ensure it does not interfere with the release.  

Chief’s Holsters have a lifetime warranty on materials and workmanship under normal use."

In May of 2011, Kel-Tec issued a recall on the fluted barrels installed on all PMR30 pistols sold before that date due to a problem with the 22 WMR bullets tumbling and keyholing. In some instances, they simply mailed a new barrel to current owners, allowing them to keep their recalled, fluted barrels. I would like to buy one of these barrels because I suspect the 1:16 twist ratio will work well for a project I am doing, though I don't want to spend $67 on a new one just to cut it up. Please contact me if you happen to have one of these barrels and would be willing to sell it for about $30."

 The 80 Percent anodized AR-15 lower receiver is our standard 80 AR-15 lower receiver with mil-spec hard coat anodizing.

 These 80 Percent AR-15 Lower receivers start as 7075-T6 forgings from the lead forge in the US and are fully machined to mil-spec tolerances. The operations left to be completed are as follows/ fire control group, trigger pin, hammer pin, trigger slot and the safety selector hole. These are anodized with a mil-spec type III hard coat anodizing. This is a not an FFL item. This is not a complete receiver and still requires machining to be done. 

There is a plethora of information on the internet including videos. 

If you are interested these are available for Pre-Order Only. Orders will ship in 4-8 weeks from order date. Other companies have huge back-logged orders and are not shipping until as early as OCT 2014 and beyond.

If you for some reason wanna use your AR for home defense, this could also be used to keep from shooting through the next 3 houses.  For those who don't know, frangible rounds are designed to break apart into small pieces on contact.  They can be used for close quarters combat or to reduce environmental impact in outdoor ranges. The 2nd and 3rd pictures show the frangible rounds close up. Yes they can still kill someone.  Outright sale is $18 a box for purchases of 10 or less.  If you want over 10 boxes I will make you a slightly better deal (be realistic with current market conditions please)

Any quantity less than all will be $1 a round. (i'm not making anything on these, I have about .93 cent a round in them with shipping costs)  For those asking why i'd sell, I'm unemployed at the moment and could simply use a little income.  Please don't bother emailing me to offer me less than posted as I don't have to sell these and for the ""experts,"" the market now is far different than it was in October and I don't need a lesson in capitalism.

I agree..I know the reason is because of the limited amount to ammo in the stores. But does that give you the right to triple the price (trick question i know). Some will say yes and others will say no. I just ask where is your heart at ..i guess in your wallet. i was lookn for ammo again tonight and I see someone selling 100rds of 22Lr for $25 . Wow..really? Well anyway ammo is starting to show up back on the shelve so i hope those of you that are trying to take advantage of people right now don't sell anything on here..and I really don't want to give up my stash place that has ammo but if you want factory ammo at a decent price not cheap but reason price I know a place that is fully stocked as of today. Contact me. I don't work for them and they haven't asked me to post this..i'm just tired of the price gauging on here. excuse the mistakes and bad grammar, just wanted to vent for a second(or longer) and get my point across as simple as possible.  I won't respond or go back and forth with anyone so please keep the negative comment to yourself. I just want to help some shooters so they don't have sell they a vital organ to get some ammo. I guess if you respond negatively that you are the guilty party.
