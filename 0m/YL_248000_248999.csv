Beautiful engraving and wood!  I do not believe this model is no longer available, and very hard to find, especially NIB.  The 16 ga. was developed due to demand for a lighter, easier handling, less recoil shotgun than the 10 & 12 ga.  Some manufactures build their 16 ga shotguns on 12 ga frames, thus weigh reduction is minimal.  The 'Real 16' is built on a true 20 ga frame, thus obtaining true weight reduction, easier handling qualities.  The retail on this shotgun was $1199, get this one at a GREAT PRICE.

I have spent many years putting this collection together. I have collected autographs since I was a kid and I have enjoyed the hobby for many years. Now, my time with this great collection has passed. Over time, I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on this collection. The majority of my collection consists of vintage baseball autographs such as Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams, Joe Dimaggio, Ty Cobb, Roger Maris, and many more vintage baseball stars. All of my autographs have been authenticated and all come with certificates of authenticity. Below is a list of every item in my collection. You will also see a value for what each item typically sales for. These are not my asking prices. The total value of the collection is approximately $24,265. This is not my asking price. I am only asking $3,500 for the entire collection. I know I am taking a huge loss but I am in a must sell situation. My wife and I have found a piece of property that we are interested in purchasing but we need a larger down payment. So we do not miss the opportunity to buy our dream home. As I said, this is a must sell situation so I will listen to all reasonable offers. I was asking $5,500 for the entire collection. I have dropped my price by $2,000 because we really need to sell the entire collection as soon as possible. This is really going to be an amazing deal for someone. You will not find a nicer collection at a better price. I have thousands more invested in this collection than my asking price. I am taking a huge loss on this collection. I really hate to see this great collection go but I honestly have no other choice. We really need the money right now. My loss is your gain. This would be a great investment opportunity for someone. This would even be great for someone that sells on ebay. You could list these items for sale individually and you could make a large profit if you just have the time. We do not have the time to do this. We need this collection gone as soon as possible. With Christmas right around the corner, this would also make an amazing Christmas gift for the baseball fan in your family. This collection will not last long at this price. If you have any questions or would like to make an offer, please feel free to contact me by email. Thanks for looking.

Why I am selling this gun: Okay, so in the midst of Black Friday I bought a Beretta Nano. It was really crowded and I didn't take enough time to hold the gun in my hand at the store. I guess I just got caught up in the moment of finding the elusive Nano (and the last one that was NOT a display model at the store) and just bought it. Well, I held it, really gripped it and sadly, it doesn't feel good in my hands. In fact, I really have no desire to take it to the range.

You must have a LTC and a valid IN drivers license.

It has been rarely fired, but I can absolutely grade it a 99%. Along with this rifle are 5 boxes of new ammunition. A most desirable rifle made in Finland, it has the L61R action which according to Wikpedia, was manufactured from 1987 to 1992. After that, a “newer” model was introduced, however these “newer” models  were “not as highly regarded as the L461/L579/L61R and according to folklore, the quality of the workmanship is slightly inferior…..”.   I am asking $1,000 for everything. If you are interested, please contact me through this site and we can set up a time for you to inspect it.  Sorry, but I am not looking to trade for anything. Also, I will ask for a valid ID – everyone knows the drill I’m sure.  Thanks for looking."

The safety is smooth and not stiff and can easily be operated with one finger as it was meant to be. The gas tube is also easily removed and is not stuck in place.

The furniture is in excellent shape with no wear, and has a NATO length buttstock for taller individuals.

This was a replacement model hand picked for me by Century. It was looked over and test fired to ensure function and accuracy prior to being shipped to me. Total round count is less than 150 with thorough cleaning in between. I take very good care of my investments and the rifle shows that. It is a base model AK, but is upgradeable, has been very reliable, and accurate. 

The only reason for selling it is that I have picked up an Arsenal and don't need more AK's

Please read: I know that Bud's Police Supply sells these for $451 brand new (if you qualify and if they are in stock.) Also you do not need to contact me to let me know you can find this cheaper somewhere else. If those $350 deals are out there please feel free to buy them.

Now that I have that off my chest, if you must buy it new, please shop elsewhere. If you add Bud's $451 plus $20 FFL fee plus $30 for the Kydex holster you are at $501. 

Unfortunately I must put $449 on my asking price and let you talk me down to $400 so you can save $100. If I put $400 as my asking price I am flooded with $350 offers. Make no mistake, $400 truly is the bottom line. This is a KAHR P380, not a Ruger LCP or Kel-Tec.  Thanks for understanding the difference.

See if you can answer these questions - which every American who loves his country should be able to answer:
1. When and where was the American Revolution won, according to John Adams?
2. When and where did the Revolutionary War break out?
3. What caused the British Regulars, the most well-trained, well-disciplined army in the world, to break and run at Concord's North Bridge, after only two minutes of musket fire by shopkeepers and farmers?
4.  What caused this reversal of British military opinion:

BEFORE April 19, 1775:
""Americans are raw, undisciplined and cowardly"". John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich and 1st Lord of the Admiralty 

""With a thousand British grenadiers I would undertake to go from one end of America to the other and geld all the males, partly by force and partly with a little coaxing"". Major General Alured Clarke 

AFTER April 19, 1775:
""Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself very much mistaken. They have men amongst them who know very well what they are about..."" Lieutenant-General Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland

The barrel has been cut down to 18 inches and threaded ½x28 to accept muzzle breaks, flash hiders, sound suppressors etc. It currently wears a recoil reducing muzzle break that takes all of the recoil away and makes this 7mm Magnum a pleasure to shoot. Has no kick but is extremely loud! Barrel is completely free floated and it has a detachable box magazine. All the metal on this gun has been media blasted and coated in bake on CERAKOTE. The color is Flat Dark Earth and if you don’t know what CERAKOTE is just research it. It is the strongest, toughest firearm coating on the planet and makes all other coatings look like water paint. All work has been professionally done. Never worry about rust again. I don’t hafta part with this rifle, so please no crazy low ball offers guys. Its not eating anything in the gun safe.

I enjoy building them, but don't have much use for it afterward, so it's up for sale here. :)
It will be sold my me as a personal transaction, no dealer involvement required, unless you need me to ship it. In that case, you'll of course have to arrange for a dealer on your end to handle the transfer for you.

The gun is a typical M4, with 16"" barrel, flat top, A2 flash hider etc..

It has the following upgrades/accessories: 
(all parts are standard black unless noted otherwise)
- Magpul MOE handguard
- Magpul PTS MOE handguard sling point
- Magpul PTS MOE pistol grip in Dark Earth (not pictured)
- Magpul PTS MBUS sights in Dark Earth (not pictured) (OPTIONAL +$20)
- Custom 5 lb trigger with NO creep and very little takeup, very smooth
- Magpul PTS CTR stock, customized to be very smooth, with no rattle at any point.
- Hammer buffer to allow safe dry-firing.
- ASAP-style single point ambidextrous receiver sling point
- Low profile gas block with top rail (great for free floated handguards)
- Ambidextrous tactical charging handle latch
- Magpul PTS extended trigger guard (for gloves) (I have both Black and Dark Earth, your choice)
- FAB Defense MWG (Mag Well Foregrip), adds a nice grip point in front of the mag well
- Includes 1 new USGI magazine

Also available is a REALLY nice holographic sight.
It's a clone of the EOTech EXPS, which is one of the new versions with the controls on the side. This is handy if you plan to use it with a magnifier, as the controls stay out of the way.
The sight is brand new, includes the box and all paperwork, and comes with a ScopeCoat to protect it. It's $100 extra if purchased with the gun, or $125 by itself.
Please Note: The sight in the photos is NOT the EOTech clone, it's just a cheap one I had laying around that I stuck on there for fun.

I also have a Magpul Dynamics MS2 tactical sling that I'll let go for $15.

The gun is basically brand new. It's had about 6 rounds through it for function testing, and will have maybe 10 more to sight in the new holosight when it comes in.

After World War II, the Yugoslavs took this design and incorporated modifications based upon Germany's Mauser Karabiner 98k. Although similar in general appearance to that of the German rifle, many of the parts of these two rifles are not interchangeable, especially the bolt and related action parts. The main difference between the M48 and the K98k is that the M48 uses an intermediate-length receiver. They are usually easily identified by the top handguard, which extends behind the rear sight and ends just in front of the receiver ring, although this feature exists on other models as well.
