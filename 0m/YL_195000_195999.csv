The bore looks very good, no pitting or rust. I've given the old girl a good cleaning and test fired a few rounds through her...slick as snot. The little Weaver scope is a 4X fixed power and is clear and the crosshairs are square. This gun does qualify as C&R due to its age. This gun is sold as is, no returns.

It shoots the same widely available and very cheap surplus ammo that the Tokarev TT33 pistol shoots. OAL is just over 22” with a 10” barrel. It comes with 2 (two) 35 round magazines and cleaning kit. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, and the front sight adjustable for windage and elevation. It weighs about 8 pounds and the barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. Because of the short barrel and permanently folded stock, this firearm is considered a pistol by the ATF. In 2010, Pioneer Arms began manufacturing the PPS-43C at the famed Radom Plant in Poland from new parts and components. This gun is sold as is, no returns. Cash only, no trades, no trade offers.

Selling things because I'm in school now full time, moving around a lot, and simply don't have the time to use everything - so I'm moving it on.

Have some extras as well, ammo perfect for testing out preferred defensive round if you don't trust your life to buying ammo from someone else:
-1x25rd box Magtech Guardian Gold 38+P 125GR ($10)
-1x25rd box Hornady Critical Defense 357Mag 125GR ($15)

There is some minor corrosion on the outside of the barrels (most of the bluing is worn off) and the furniture has the usual dings you’d expect from something 80-100 years old.  The action seems loose so I would not fire it without an inspection by a gunsmith.  I don’t know too much about this gun other than it was probably manufactured in the early 1900’s by the Tobin Arms Company, and sold by the Norvell-Sharpleigh Hardware company.

That is more than most other .45 pistols can. One of the key differences in the Glock 21 than the other Glock pistols is that the Glock 21 has a lighter slide. This lighter slide is what helps the Glock 21 be so accurate. In all of the Glock 21 reviews you will see that people rave about the accuracy of the Glock 21. Best Police Guns has fired the Glock 21 on several occasions and can attest to the accuracy of the Glock 21. Obviously some of the accuracy has to do with the shooter. A handgun can only be as accurate as the shooter is. and this gun is Very accurate Handgun

Add a true “museum piece” to your gun collection. The gunmakers at Benelli and the master engravers at Bottega Giovanelli have collaborated to produce truly unique collectors quality firearms in the World Class Curator 12- and 20-gauge set. This extraordinary Benelli “special product of the year” is now available in the United States as a limited release of only 250 specially numbered sets that combine superb shooting characteristics, unparalleled Italian design with superfine metalwork and engraving.
The left side of the lower receiver is engraved with deeply chassed scrollwork and a medallion portraying a pair of chukars set against a gold-overlaid mountain landscape. At right, bevel-cut floral engraving and cinquefoils frame a bounding hare. On the right hand face, the gold details include a rising ring-necked pheasant and a landing mallard duck.
Benelli artisans have chosen AAA-Grade European walnut for the Curator’s stock and fore-end. The lavishly figured wood is satin finished and the grip and fore-end are cut with fine-line, 28 line-per-inch checkering. A sterling silver medallion is provided with each Curator that can be custom engraved and set into the grip cap. Matched walnut butt plates are standard on each gun. For field use, a fitted rubber recoil pad is included for the 20-gauge as an accessory in each set’s hard case.
All 250 Curator sets bound for American shores will be housed in metallic-finished, custom gun cases. The felt-lined fitted interior of each case holds both shotguns and includes a carbon-fiber enhanced storage compartment nestled between the guns.

(M)odel Contour Frame
The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XDM, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. 
(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations
Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. 
(M)ega-Lock Texture
The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XDM isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 
The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. 
(M)elonite
Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 
The rugged Melonite® finish on the XDM is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. 
(M)atch Grade Barrel
Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XDM match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.
(M)inimal Reset Trigger
The new XDM trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. 
The Standards
In 2001, Springfield Armory® set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. 
With the introduction of the XD® polymer pistol, they did just that….
Loaded Chamber Indicator
The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber. 
Striker Status Indicator
The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position.
Grip Safety
Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. 
USA Trigger System™
The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.

Low barrel axis position
Thanks to the design of the direct barrel-slide locking system, the low barrel axis reduces felt recoil and minimizes muzzle rise.
Newly designed slide
The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in moist conditions.
3-Dot Sight System
Features a white '3-dot' sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
Simple Field Stripping
Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
External Hammer Design
A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
Ambidextrous Safety (Type F)
The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it's either positively ""on"" or ""off"". The safety lever also functions as the pistol's decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever.) Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop
Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block
The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the bloack is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer
No Glare Finish
Beretta's exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish
Slide
The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions
Accessory Rail
The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapic attachment of tacitcal lights and laser aiming devices
Reversible Magazine Release
Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual's hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use
Individual Size Grips
Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large back-straps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
Magazine
High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds (1 round for .45 Auto caliber).

Comprehensive Indiana Gun Law is a complete educational program on Indiana gun law, which also includes a discussion of applicable federal law.  This full-day program includes a wide-ranging discussion of Indiana's statutes and court rulings that affect Indiana gun owners' ability to defend themselves and others with deadly force, as well as Indiana law determining potential criminal and civil liabilities for inappropriate use of a firearm.

Here is a testimonial regarding TFT's Comprehensive Indiana Gun Law course from an experienced firearm and ""Force on Force"" instructor:

        ""Today I attended Tactical Firearms Training LLC's Comprehensive Indiana Gun Law course.
        
        The class today was a look at US and Indiana state law that address four specific areas:

        1. Possessing a firearm
        2. Carrying a handgun
        3. Use of a firearm for self defense
        4. Civil liability

        We started at the Eagle Creek classroom at 8:30 sharp and went to 3ish with a few breaks for bathroom visits and lunch. The class was well organized with most of the content contained in a PowerPoint presentation. This was not just a cursory overview, but rather as the title suggests, a comprehensive review. Guy was meticulous in his citations of the case law and Indiana Code allowing the student to research and pull the cited sections if desired. I don't want to make this sound like a dry legal lecture. While the law was covered Guy also went ""off script"" and expanded a great deal on areas that needed to have context or history filled in.

    We had some great class discussions and Guy was good about entertaining student questions or requests for clarification. To Guy's credit, he did a very good job of leaving most of the legalese behind and explaining concepts in plain English.

    Worth the price of admission alone, I learned what a 'curtilage' is. 

    Now I get on my soap box. I read frequent posts here other places about how training is too expensive or too long or too far away or too this or too that........ Here you have a local class on a very, very important topic taught by an expert in the field.

    At what point will you prioritize the knowledge in your head over acquiring more guns? Is it better to spend $150 on another trinket or invest that money in yourself to hopefully keep yourself out of jail and limit your civil liability if you do ever have to use deadly force to protect yourself?

    In conclusion, I thought the class was a good value and a lot of fun."""

I have fired less than 200 rounds in this thing!
It comes stock with a threaded barrel to accept any silencer or suppressor you may have. also accepts most any muzzle tips (flash hider, flash suppressors, muzzle breaks, bird cages) the barrel tip that is in some of the pictures, the one with the holes in it, does NOT come with this gun. i just bought it and want to put it on my rifle. I just put it in the picture to show how the threaded barrel. The reason I am selling this is because I am closing on my first house and wow lol now i need some fast cash. 

Fun and easy to shoot gun. This is a great deal to be coming with the red dot sight and the laser sight. the laser is dead on, shoot bulleseye from the hip, the red dot i never did get sighted in. I feel Im taking a pretty good hit on this but need the money and still feel this is a fair price.

I can meet you. I'm only going to be in town for a week or two then I am going back to SC(for sale there as well) Must be 21 to buy. Will not ship unless you arrange all the details and i just have to drop it off. 

It has a list of things to go with it.
--picatinny rail on the top AND on the bottom. for lights, lasers, sights, anything.
--low profile laser with adjustable windage and elevation.
--red dot doctor sight on top with same type of adjustments.
--cover for the doc sight
--Allen wrench for moving sights around and what have you.
--10 round magazine
--thread protector for the threaded barrel
--Custom kydex grip panels
--soft padded case

It has a few modifications done to it.
--sling shot mod, makes it easy to release the bolt when reloading.
--magazine safety removed, makes it so you can still fire a round when the mag is removed( incase you only want to load one round, you don't need the mag.)
--red added to safety to make it easier to see
--Custom grip panels, black on black just look great!

Feel free to call, text, or email anytime if you have a question.

The Equinox® is the balance between day and night. So it should come as no surprise that the SIG SAUER® P220® Equinox has evolved from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop. The P220 Equinox is a limited .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox™ comes with gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function."
