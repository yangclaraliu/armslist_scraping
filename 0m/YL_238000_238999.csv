They are great guns to own and fun to shoot. I LOVED how much more accurate this is than my AKs. 2 inch groupings at 100 yards!

The extremely compact HK P7M13 can be drawn, cocked, and fired accurately, faster than any other pistol. With an overall length and width close to many .380 pocket pistols, the full-power 9mm P7M13 has a full-length four-inch barrel enclosed in its low profile steel slide.

The unique HK cocking lever allows the P7M13 to be carried safely with a round in the chamber, yet it is ready to fire by the intentional squeezing of the fingers around the grip. Releasing the cocking lever decocks the P7M13 immediately and renders it completely safe.

The P7M13 gas system retards the movement of the recoiling slide during firing and eliminates the need for a conventional locking mechanism or heavy slide. The low profile slide contributes to the balanced center of gravity and compact size of the P7M13.

Made of high-grade steel, the low profile slide keeps the recoiling mass as small as possible. Combined with the optimal grip angle of 110°, the result is a compact, accurate, and low recoil pistol well suited to civilian and law enforcement users."

This is an authentic Springfield Model 1842 smoothbore .69 caliber muzzle loading musket.  It was likely used in the Civil War.  This rifle is in good to very good condition for its age and includes the ramrod and bayonet.  

This was the first regulation percussion ignition musket made at the national armories. It was also the last smoothbore U.S. arm made in .69 caliber and the first U.S. weapon made at both Springfield and Harpers Ferry.   The Model 1842 was the first small arm produced in the U.S. with fully interchangeable, machine-made parts. About 172,000 Model 1842 muskets were produced at the Springfield national armory between 1844 and 1855.  

This gun has the following stampings on the steel:
Lock:  1850 and U.S. eagle with arrows
Breech:  1852
Barrel:  V over P with an eagle head
Butt plate:  U.S. 51

The metal has brown patina throughout with some minor pitting.  The lock, trigger and hammer operate.  The wood is in good condition with typical dings, scratches and handling marks.  The wood butt also has “PM” etched in it, which is a typical soldier marking of military rifles of the era.  This rifle is 58 inches long and appears to be all original and historically correct.  It has not been cleaned, polished, repaired or altered in order to preserve its value.

The value of this rifle is in its historical significance, original materials, age and condition.  The highly visible markings on the steel hardware combined with the bayonet make this a rare find and worthy of adding to a collection or using in Civil War reenactments.

 A great gift for the Civil War enthusiast!  More photos available upon request.

I will ship within the continental U.S. where legal for $35.  Buyer assumes all responsibility for legal ownership and use.  Due to the age of this gun and percussion firing mechanism, no FFL is required.

This gun is a late 1990's serial, US production. It is in very very good condition. I'm not sure on the round count. I've put 100 through it. My estimate would that it has had 500ish rounds. Definitely less than 1000. The finish is in great shape, with no external wear whatsoever. Typical barrel wear, but nothing more than expected. 

The gun comes with two sets of grips. The original black Beretta grips, and also the ones pictured, which are handmade by Marschal Grips from Budapest, Hungary. They are purple heart wood. They have a great fit and look (I think) fantastic. 

This Beretta has had a trigger job done by Langdon Tactical. It has such a sweet, smooth trigger. It's definitely my best shooting gun. It will come with two magazines. One is the typical military and one MecGar (pictured).

I'm selling this gun not because I don't like it, but simply because I don't shoot it. I have five 9mm guns and this one I shoot the least often (as you can tell, I think I've only shot it once). I'm more of a Glock and SIG guy.

Here's a pic. Sorry the quality isn't that good, I took it on my phone. It was freshly cleaned and oiled yesterday (right before I took the pic), so it looks pretty glossy.

Would prefer FTF in the Burlington/Greensboro/Raleigh area, but we can probably make anything work, and I can ship to any FFL if necessary.

$450 with extras.

I bought it as a back-up replacement when my Super Black Eagle went down during the season.  I bought it and used it for about a month waiting for my SBE to be fixed and it has been cased ever since.

It does have a few medium scuffs on the barrel that I just noticed from hunting in my layout blind so I have dropped the price.  You can get the barrel dipped in black teflon pretty cheaply but  it doesn't need it.

The magazine extension can be added/removed easily if you are hunting spring snow geese - I've never used it but I have an extension for my SBE too that is sweet!

New Nova's are $365 plus tax and the magazine extensions are anywhere between $25-$50 so for $265.00 this is a steal!

 *I live in Havelock and you could shoot the rifle but you have to have the cash to prove you would be willing to buy it and not just trying to shoot the gun. 
This package is worth over  $1800.00 so you're getting a great deal. I have never seen a AR as nice looking as this one, its definitely a one of kind. I have put maybe 60 rounds through it and I cleaned it after time I have fired it. There are absolutely no flaws with this weapon system I'm only selling it because I came up with another AR project. If you want the firearm CALL OR TEXT me at REDACTED

This is a very nice AR, it is hooked up and ready for the range, I purchased it and never shot it so I thought I would sell it and buy something else.   I am in no rush to sell it.  Trades considered if they are favored my way since I prefer cash on this Rifle.

Lone Wolf Barrel, Hieni Sights. 125 front. 140 notch, Glocktriggers.com challenger trigger, Zev Tec skeletonized striker, 4 - 17 round mags. I bought this gun because I wanted to get into USPA, but have changed my mind. The previous owner says the gun has ran flawlessly in several matches, and range trips. I have not fired the gun, but I did take it all apart, clean it up, and make sure it was operating properly. It looks like a stock 34 with some sandpaper type grip tape on the sides of the grips. 

Price is $675.00 OBRO but I am not going to budge much. with the gun and all the extras it would cost $1100.00 - $1200.00 to duplicate the gun.

The ONLY trade I am interested in is a stock Glock 34 that I can customize the way I want to, plus cash on your end of course. Any other offers will be ignored.

Used to be imported in the early 90s, but it was banned along with Norinco 7.62x39 for it's steel cores. 

This stuff is VERY accurate, though I've only fired 40rds of it, but it's probably the most accurate 7.62x39 I've ever fired (and it's higher end than old Soviet surplus I'd assume).

Price is $130 for the whole lot.

BECAUSE BEAUTY AND FUNCTIONALITY AREN’T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
 SIG SAUER® pistols have long provided their owners with peace of mind. Now the SIG Sauer Custom
 Shop Equinox series adds pride of ownership to that feeling. The distinctive polished slide flats and
 nickel controls contrast with the dark-coated surfaces for a visually arresting two-tone appearance. When
 combined with its practical features, the Equinox series is pretty to look at and beautiful to shoot.

The P238 Equinox®, it’s just a fraction of the size of our ful-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® rear Night Sight and Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Front Sight. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine."
