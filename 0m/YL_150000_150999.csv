Adding to this deal, I have a "" THE AS IV Automatic Simulator"" that I will put with it for the right deal. From what I have been told and could find you do not have to have any other paper work to have or use it. It clamps on the trigger housing and it is spring loaded. One allen wrench is all that is needed. There is no modification done to the gun. Simple to put on and simple to take off. A 5 round clip goes very fast.

The Safariland Model 6280 holster is the base model of Self Locking System (SLS™) series of holsters. It includes a unique rotating hood design. This holster also features a Universal Belt Loop that mounts on a 2"" or 2.25"" Duty Belt. With no snap, the Safariland 6280 holster’s SLS™ design allows for a smoother single-motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways. The hood can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. It is also far less likely to release accidentally than conventional thumb break snaps. The 6280 holster features a tensioning device, which, when firmly adjusted becomes a Level III Retention™ holster.
•SLS (Self Locking System)
•Mid-Ride position allows for excellent weapon protection and quick easy draw
•Top draw and straight drop cant
•For pistols or revolvers

Taurus PT845 .45ACP
Posted by Chris Christian. Author Archive » 

Based on a pistol for the US Armed Forces but with a “strike two” capability!



When the United States Special Operations Command announced that it was considering adopting a new service handgun, and laid down the performance requirements for the pistol, a number of handgun makers responded. The result was several new handgun designs that, in light of the postponement of the SOCOM tests, have now been made available to the civilian market.

One was the Taurus 24/7 OSS. As a full-sized service handgun it’s proven to be rugged and reliable. But it’s a bit much to pack concealed on a daily basis. Taurus responded by taking some of the ergonomic features of the 24/7 OSS, adding a few innovations, trimming the size and weight, and introduced a new line of mid-sized semi-auto handguns. The result was the Taurus 800 Series that was introduced in 2008. It is available in 9mm (PT809, 17+1) .40 (PT840, 15+1) and .45ACP (PT845, 12+1). For our test we had the big bore .45ACP model.

The PT845 .45ACP is built on a polymer frame with either a forged steel slide with a black Tennifer finish, or a stainless steel slide. My test model wore the Tennifer finish. A captive recoil spring with a full-length stainless steel guide rod mated with a bushingless barrel to complete the upper unit.

The empty weight is a relatively light 28.2 ounces. The ramped barrel measures 4 inches, providing an overall length of 8.25 inches, a height of 6-inches, and a width of 1.14 inches. An integral rail allows for easy mounting of light or laser. Capacity is 12+1. 

Ergonomics
Noted pistolsmith Wayne Novak, who made a career out of customizing concealed carry handguns, once observed that a good carry pistol “should feel like a well used bar of soap.” It has become an overused cliché, but I can’t find a better way to describe the way the PT845 comes into my hand. 

The backstrap features Taurus’ aggressive ribbed checkering, while the rear portion of the side panels are smooth. The ribbed pattern continues on the front portion of the side panels and wraps around the front strap, where two slight projections create a subtle finger groove effect. Right and left side memory grooves channel the trigger finger to the proper position. When my hand contacts the gun in the holster a proper shooting grip is automatically achieved. 

Complementing that is a nicely undercut triggerguard that has the sharp lower edge relieved. I own several makes of polymer framed pistols and shoot them regularly. All required some attention with a Dremel tool to smooth the triggerguard edge. That wasn’t necessary with the PT845. It’s a very comfortable pistol.

Three interchangeable backstraps of different sizes are supplied. They are changed by drifting out a solid retaining pin at the lower portion of the backstrap, which also serves as a lanyard loop, and sliding a different size insert into place. I have average-sized hands and the backstrap that arrived on the gun was an excellent fit for me, so I felt no need to try the other two sizes. 

Firing Mechanism
Taurus notes that the PT845 was derived from the Taurus 24/7 OSS series, but the firing mechanism is quite a bit different. This is not a striker-fired, internal hammer pistol. A slide mounted inertia-type firing pin provides the primer blow. This is a traditional DA/SA design with an external hammer and has repeat strike capability. In the same manner as the CZ-75 or the Beretta Tomcat, the gun can be carried with the hammer in three different positions. When the hammer is fully lowered it provides a lengthy DA pull with a slight, but noticeable, stacking at the rear of the stroke. My Lyman Digital Trigger Pull Gauge says the pull is 10.5 pounds. Ease the hammer back slightly, to what amounts to a quarter-cock position, and about half of the trigger pull length is turned into take-up slack. The pull weight remains the same but the pull length is significantly reduced.

With the hammer in the SA mode the pull weight is a relatively crisp 6.5 pounds with only a suggestion of creep. The trigger is smooth faced and nicely rounded.

A frame-mounted ambidextrous safety allows the gun to be carried DA or SA (cocked and locked) and the safety can be engaged to block the trigger in each hammer position. The frame-mounted safety has a third position that also serves as a decocking mechanism. With the safety engaged in the up position, depressing it to the middle position disengages it. Push it further down to the third position and it decocks the pistol. The PT845 also includes an internal firing pin block that prevents the firing pin from moving forward until the trigger has been moved to its final rearward position.

Completing the operating controls are ambidextrous slide and magazine releases. A loaded chamber indicator peeks out from the upper side of the extractor when a round is chambered.

The PT845 does not have a magazine disconnect safety, and will fire with the magazine removed. The double stack magazines are solidly made with right side witness holes at 6 and 12 rounds and are a drop-free design. A finger extension base plate provides a comfortable rest for the support hand and also makes magazine insertion very positive. A magazine loading tool is provided, but I didn’t need it. Finger power alone was enough to easily get all 12 rounds into each of the two supplied magazines.

Sights are a three white dot pattern and are drift adjustable for windage. Both front and rear are dovetailed into the slide and securely retained via an Allen screw. They are cut a bit taller than many other sights and allow a generous amount of light around the front sight. I found them very quick to acquire.

The PT845 arrived in a foam-lined pad lockable case with two magazines, a bristle bore brush, magazine loading tool, two additional interchangeable backstraps, and two keys to activate the Taurus Security System lock, which is located on the rear portion of the lower right rear grip panel.

Range Time
Prior to heading out to my backyard range I did a quick field strip and added oil to the appropriate points. A Bianchi Model 7 Shadow II three-slot pancake holster for the Glock 29/30 was an excellent fit for the Taurus. So, I headed out to the range with the PT845 and holster.

Test ammunition included 230-grain Winchester Target/Range FMJ, Federal’s 230-grain Hydra-Shok and 165-grain EFMJ, Hornady’s 185-grain Custom XTP JHP, Remington’s 230-grain Golden Saber, and my 230-grain LRN match reload. I also had a hundred 185-grain lead semi-wadcutter reloads of dubious heritage that I figured would be a good test for feeding, so they were included.

Working from the holster, my initial shooting was no more complex than ringing some hanging plates and bouncing empty beverage cans from the 10- to 15-yard mark. The gun proved to be a natural pointer that came quickly to hand. And, even with full power 230-grain loads, it was very controllable and soft shooting.

The gun fed everything that went into the magazine (even the 185-grain LSWC reloads) and case ejection was smooth and consistent. 

Once I had about 200 rounds through the gun I settled down on a 15-yard sandbag rest, shooting SA, for accuracy tests. The PT845 was not a fan of swaged lead reloads, but did have an affinity for jacketed fodder. The 230-grain loads showed the best accuracy, as is often the case with the .45ACP, but lighter bullet weights proved more than accurate enough for self-defense tasks. 

Timed Drills
Plinking, bench rest accuracy tests, and a few basic handling drills can tell you a lot about how a pistol will perform, but they don’t give me as clear a picture as does running the gun under some degree of stress or at the least, running timed drills against the clock. An IDPA or USPSA match would have been a nice test, but with only two magazines in hand it wasn’t in the cards. Instead, I ran some of my basic practice drills with my PACT III Club Timer. I have been running these drills for years and know what my normal PAR time/score is with whichever of my match guns I’m running.

The first test was three IDPA targets set up 6 feet apart at 7 yards. The drill is simple: at the buzzer, draw and double tap each target. I ran this ten times with 230-grain Winchester Target/Range full power ball ammo. The first two runs were 4.46 and 4.27 seconds respectively. The next eight runs were between 3.93 and 3.67 seconds. The second drill is a single IDPA target at 7 yards, two to the chest and one to the head. Ten runs produced times of 2.41 to 2.33 seconds.

The times on the first drill were within a half-second of my normal time with my match-tuned .45ACP, while the times on the second drill were almost identical. The scores were not quite as good. I had a tendency to drop the first round a bit low and out of the 0-zone with the DA pull, but follow-up shots were on the mark with the gun in the SA mode. That, however, is comparing a stock, out-of-the-box, DA/SA semi-auto in a high ride concealed carry holster against a match tuned semi-auto with a crisp 3.5-pound trigger, fiber optic sights, handloads softer than full power ball, and from a straight drop Blade-Tech competition holster. 

Final Notes
Well over 300 rounds went downrange in this test. They included bullet weights from 230 to 165 grains, as well as some dubious semi-wadcutter reloads. The only malfunctions were my operator errors with the thumb safety. Once the basic tests were done, I cleaned the gun, stuffed it with Federal Hydra-Shoks, and carried it for two weeks in place of the compact 9mm that’s my normal carry gun. I found it to be every bit as comfortable to carry. That’s a lot to ask from a pistol that packs 12+1 rounds of .45ACP, but the PT845 delivered.

Have some cash in hand. I happen to own a winter clothing company based in Duluth. If you're in the market for natural fiber anoraks, parkas, mukluks, and wool insulation layers, AND you have an handgun you can part with, I'm all ears.

It's an odd sort of transaction for sure, but it's not my first rodeo. I'll make it worth your while. We're a real business, with a long history of outfitting folks who thrive in our abusive winter climates. Our gear has been to both poles, and trekked on all 7 continents. Email for details."

The NRA/Shooting Illustrated called the Mossberg® 930™ SPX™ their ""2009 Shotgun of the Year."" We call it the best auto-loading home-defense shotgun money can buy. The 930 SPX was named ""2009 Shotgun of the Year"" by Shooting Illustrated magazine and recognized with the prestigious NRA Golden Bullseye Award for 2009. Among their comments, editors pointed out the shotgun's exceptional value, and described it succinctly as ""Simple, rugged and reliable."" When it comes to home-security firearms, a simple-to-operate, dependable firearm in a crisis can make a world of difference. For that reason, Mossberg 930 Special Purpose™ autoloaders are finding their way into more homes as a primary defense firearm. All Mossberg 930 Special Purpose shotguns feature a self-regulating gas system that vents excess gas to aid in recoil reduction and eliminate stress on critical components. All 930 autoloaders chamber both 2 3/4 inch and 3-inch 12-gauge shotshells with ease—from target loads, to non-toxic magnum loads, to the latest sabot slug ammo. Magazine capacity is 7+1 on models with extended magazine tube, 4+1 on models without. To complete the package, each Mossberg 930 includes a set of specially designed spacers for quick adjustment of the horizontal and vertical angle of the stock, bringing a custom-feel fit to every shooter. Safety and safe handling is of paramount importance in special purpose firearms, and the 930 was engineered with that in mind. The receiver-mounted safety is convenient for right or left-handed users; simply push the button forward to take the weapon off safe. A protruding chrome cocking-indicator button is strategically placed in the front inner-edge of the trigger guard, making it easy to see and feel when the weapon is cocked or un-cocked. Unloading has been made easier too, with the Mossberg EZ-Empty™ system. While holding the elevator (carrier) down with your thumb, press the bolt release. This will release one round from the magazine tube under spring pressure. Repeat this procedure until the magazine tube is empty. All 930 Special Purpose models feature a drilled and tapped receiver, factory-ready for Picatinny rail, scope base or optics installation. 930 SPX models conveniently come with a factory-mounted Picatinny rail and LPA/M16-Style Ghost Ring combination sight right out of the box. Other sighting options include a basic front bead, or white-dot front sights. Mossberg 930 Special Purpose shotguns are available in a variety of configurations; 5-shot tactical barrel, 5-shot with muzzle brake, 8-shot pistol-grip, and even a 5-shot security / field combo."

THIS GUN HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED BY SIG SAUER, SO IT IS NOW GOING TO GET HARDER AND HARDER TO FIND - WHICH DUE TO THIS BEING ONE OF THE TOP ENGINEERED PIECES OF ART IN THE GUN INDUSTRY, WILL UNDOUBTEDLY MAKE IT RISE IN VALUE!! THESE BEAUTIFUL ROSEWOOD GRIPS ARE NO LONGER OFFERED ON SIGS. Features: Ergonomic beavertail grip, front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, custom wood grips and the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. I'm selling this pistol the EXACT way that I purchased it, only a few months ago. I have never fired it, and it appears to have maybe been fired about a dozen times. This gun is Near Perfect in Every Way! I am only selling it because I have another one just like it, and I thought I needed a second one for my wife, but it's too heavy for her. Otherwise, I would keep it - it's PERFECT :) It comes with the Factory Rosewood Grips (Very Nice & HIGHLY Desirable/Expensive to buy separately). This Pistol ALSO shoots .357 Sig Ammo, with the additional purchase of a ""Drop-In"" .357 Sig Barrel. The Magazine holds BOTH .40 S&W OR .357 Sig, so if you decide to buy the .357 Barrel, you do NOT have to buy an additional magazine :) Note: This Pistol does NOT come with a .357 Sig Barrel - ONLY the .40 S&W Barrel. Included with the Pistol: One Factory 12 Round Clip Blue Sig Sauer Plastic Box (no papers, as they weren't included, when I purchased the gun). MSRP on this Item is: $1,200 As you'll see, this is an AMAZING PRICE & GUN :) Thanks for Looking & Good Luck!"

I didn't need the chassis and I don't really need the rifle either, but the rifle was smaller than the car body, so I made the trade!  After doing some pretty extensive research, I've got an ""OT-"" serial numbered model (50,000 of these made according to one or two of the sites I visited researching the gun).  Markings are scarce on this one, just the OT serial all over, with one exception, the magwell floorplate is stamped ""0520"" instead of the 5 digit OT- serial located elsewhere on the gun, no markings on stock or buttplate that I saw.  A small stamp or two on the barrel that I can't make out very well.  Bore looks good, barrel is original barrel shortened slightly for the shorter 308 round size.  Neat rifle, last guy bought it for a deer rifle for his son.  Carbine length rifle, seems to function and cycle alright once you get used to the action.  Holds 5 rounds, mauser action.  A few knicks and dings in the stock but all look old and have some patina to them.  There is one thing that makes the rifle fairly rare, this one has two crossbolts that attach the reciever through the stock.  Apparently they didn't do many like this, and I had a hard time finding a picture of any spanish 1916 with two.  Might be letting this one go too cheap because of that, I priced this according to what the last two sold for on gunbroker (actual selling price on rifles that did sell)... priced this in between the two, one was also an OT serial in 308 but without any crossbolt attachments.  Thought I'd offer it local before I listed it anywhere else.  Just rifle, no case or ammo.  Contact for more pictures!"

Taurus PT845 .45ACP
Posted by Chris Christian. Author Archive » 

Based on a pistol for the US Armed Forces but with a “strike two” capability!



When the United States Special Operations Command announced that it was considering adopting a new service handgun, and laid down the performance requirements for the pistol, a number of handgun makers responded. The result was several new handgun designs that, in light of the postponement of the SOCOM tests, have now been made available to the civilian market.

One was the Taurus 24/7 OSS. As a full-sized service handgun it’s proven to be rugged and reliable. But it’s a bit much to pack concealed on a daily basis. Taurus responded by taking some of the ergonomic features of the 24/7 OSS, adding a few innovations, trimming the size and weight, and introduced a new line of mid-sized semi-auto handguns. The result was the Taurus 800 Series that was introduced in 2008. It is available in 9mm (PT809, 17+1) .40 (PT840, 15+1) and .45ACP (PT845, 12+1). For our test we had the big bore .45ACP model.

The PT845 .45ACP is built on a polymer frame with either a forged steel slide with a black Tennifer finish, or a stainless steel slide. My test model wore the Tennifer finish. A captive recoil spring with a full-length stainless steel guide rod mated with a bushingless barrel to complete the upper unit.

The empty weight is a relatively light 28.2 ounces. The ramped barrel measures 4 inches, providing an overall length of 8.25 inches, a height of 6-inches, and a width of 1.14 inches. An integral rail allows for easy mounting of light or laser. Capacity is 12+1. 

Ergonomics
Noted pistolsmith Wayne Novak, who made a career out of customizing concealed carry handguns, once observed that a good carry pistol “should feel like a well used bar of soap.” It has become an overused cliché, but I can’t find a better way to describe the way the PT845 comes into my hand. 

The backstrap features Taurus’ aggressive ribbed checkering, while the rear portion of the side panels are smooth. The ribbed pattern continues on the front portion of the side panels and wraps around the front strap, where two slight projections create a subtle finger groove effect. Right and left side memory grooves channel the trigger finger to the proper position. When my hand contacts the gun in the holster a proper shooting grip is automatically achieved. 

Complementing that is a nicely undercut triggerguard that has the sharp lower edge relieved. I own several makes of polymer framed pistols and shoot them regularly. All required some attention with a Dremel tool to smooth the triggerguard edge. That wasn’t necessary with the PT845. It’s a very comfortable pistol.

Three interchangeable backstraps of different sizes are supplied. They are changed by drifting out a solid retaining pin at the lower portion of the backstrap, which also serves as a lanyard loop, and sliding a different size insert into place. I have average-sized hands and the backstrap that arrived on the gun was an excellent fit for me, so I felt no need to try the other two sizes. 

Firing Mechanism
Taurus notes that the PT845 was derived from the Taurus 24/7 OSS series, but the firing mechanism is quite a bit different. This is not a striker-fired, internal hammer pistol. A slide mounted inertia-type firing pin provides the primer blow. This is a traditional DA/SA design with an external hammer and has repeat strike capability. In the same manner as the CZ-75 or the Beretta Tomcat, the gun can be carried with the hammer in three different positions. When the hammer is fully lowered it provides a lengthy DA pull with a slight, but noticeable, stacking at the rear of the stroke. My Lyman Digital Trigger Pull Gauge says the pull is 10.5 pounds. Ease the hammer back slightly, to what amounts to a quarter-cock position, and about half of the trigger pull length is turned into take-up slack. The pull weight remains the same but the pull length is significantly reduced.

With the hammer in the SA mode the pull weight is a relatively crisp 6.5 pounds with only a suggestion of creep. The trigger is smooth faced and nicely rounded.

A frame-mounted ambidextrous safety allows the gun to be carried DA or SA (cocked and locked) and the safety can be engaged to block the trigger in each hammer position. The frame-mounted safety has a third position that also serves as a decocking mechanism. With the safety engaged in the up position, depressing it to the middle position disengages it. Push it further down to the third position and it decocks the pistol. The PT845 also includes an internal firing pin block that prevents the firing pin from moving forward until the trigger has been moved to its final rearward position.

Completing the operating controls are ambidextrous slide and magazine releases. A loaded chamber indicator peeks out from the upper side of the extractor when a round is chambered.

The PT845 does not have a magazine disconnect safety, and will fire with the magazine removed. The double stack magazines are solidly made with right side witness holes at 6 and 12 rounds and are a drop-free design. A finger extension base plate provides a comfortable rest for the support hand and also makes magazine insertion very positive. A magazine loading tool is provided, but I didn’t need it. Finger power alone was enough to easily get all 12 rounds into each of the two supplied magazines.

Sights are a three white dot pattern and are drift adjustable for windage. Both front and rear are dovetailed into the slide and securely retained via an Allen screw. They are cut a bit taller than many other sights and allow a generous amount of light around the front sight. I found them very quick to acquire.

The PT845 arrived in a foam-lined pad lockable case with two magazines, a bristle bore brush, magazine loading tool, two additional interchangeable backstraps, and two keys to activate the Taurus Security System lock, which is located on the rear portion of the lower right rear grip panel.

Range Time
Prior to heading out to my backyard range I did a quick field strip and added oil to the appropriate points. A Bianchi Model 7 Shadow II three-slot pancake holster for the Glock 29/30 was an excellent fit for the Taurus. So, I headed out to the range with the PT845 and holster.

Test ammunition included 230-grain Winchester Target/Range FMJ, Federal’s 230-grain Hydra-Shok and 165-grain EFMJ, Hornady’s 185-grain Custom XTP JHP, Remington’s 230-grain Golden Saber, and my 230-grain LRN match reload. I also had a hundred 185-grain lead semi-wadcutter reloads of dubious heritage that I figured would be a good test for feeding, so they were included.

Working from the holster, my initial shooting was no more complex than ringing some hanging plates and bouncing empty beverage cans from the 10- to 15-yard mark. The gun proved to be a natural pointer that came quickly to hand. And, even with full power 230-grain loads, it was very controllable and soft shooting.

The gun fed everything that went into the magazine (even the 185-grain LSWC reloads) and case ejection was smooth and consistent. 

Once I had about 200 rounds through the gun I settled down on a 15-yard sandbag rest, shooting SA, for accuracy tests. The PT845 was not a fan of swaged lead reloads, but did have an affinity for jacketed fodder. The 230-grain loads showed the best accuracy, as is often the case with the .45ACP, but lighter bullet weights proved more than accurate enough for self-defense tasks. 

Timed Drills
Plinking, bench rest accuracy tests, and a few basic handling drills can tell you a lot about how a pistol will perform, but they don’t give me as clear a picture as does running the gun under some degree of stress or at the least, running timed drills against the clock. An IDPA or USPSA match would have been a nice test, but with only two magazines in hand it wasn’t in the cards. Instead, I ran some of my basic practice drills with my PACT III Club Timer. I have been running these drills for years and know what my normal PAR time/score is with whichever of my match guns I’m running.

The first test was three IDPA targets set up 6 feet apart at 7 yards. The drill is simple: at the buzzer, draw and double tap each target. I ran this ten times with 230-grain Winchester Target/Range full power ball ammo. The first two runs were 4.46 and 4.27 seconds respectively. The next eight runs were between 3.93 and 3.67 seconds. The second drill is a single IDPA target at 7 yards, two to the chest and one to the head. Ten runs produced times of 2.41 to 2.33 seconds.

The times on the first drill were within a half-second of my normal time with my match-tuned .45ACP, while the times on the second drill were almost identical. The scores were not quite as good. I had a tendency to drop the first round a bit low and out of the 0-zone with the DA pull, but follow-up shots were on the mark with the gun in the SA mode. That, however, is comparing a stock, out-of-the-box, DA/SA semi-auto in a high ride concealed carry holster against a match tuned semi-auto with a crisp 3.5-pound trigger, fiber optic sights, handloads softer than full power ball, and from a straight drop Blade-Tech competition holster. 

Final Notes
Well over 300 rounds went downrange in this test. They included bullet weights from 230 to 165 grains, as well as some dubious semi-wadcutter reloads. The only malfunctions were my operator errors with the thumb safety. Once the basic tests were done, I cleaned the gun, stuffed it with Federal Hydra-Shoks, and carried it for two weeks in place of the compact 9mm that’s my normal carry gun. I found it to be every bit as comfortable to carry. That’s a lot to ask from a pistol that packs 12+1 rounds of .45ACP, but the PT845 delivered.

Both mags will be fully loaded with ammo.

It is in a like new condition. 

The AS trigger system of the Walther P99 has three possible carry modes: 

AS Mode The first is the AS mode which will automatically engage after a round is chambered. The trigger is fully forward, as if in double action, but the striker indicator is to the rear and visible. This mode offers the safety of carrying the P99 AS in single action with a light yet long trigger pull. 

DA Mode The second mode is Double Action. After a round is chambered, the decocking button can be depressed, releasing the striker into a double action trigger pull. In this mode the trigger is fully forward and the striker is at rest and no longer visible to the rear of the slide. After the trigger is first pulled, all subsequent shots will be in single action. This mode is considered, among fellow P99 AS owners, to be the safest mode to carry the AS in. 

SA Mode The third mode of carry for the P99 AS is Single Action. This mode can be achieved by chambering a round into the AS mode, then slowly pulling the trigger to the rear until you hear the SA portion of the sear engage. There will be an audio able click and the trigger will remain in the rear position. This mode will also automatically engage after the first trigger pull in double action mode. 


The barrel and slide have been hardness treated in the same manner that Glock has been, but Walther calls it by another trade name than Tennifer.

It was made in 1895 by the Chatellerault arsenal. It fires the 8x50Rmm Lebel cartridge via a tube magazine (though it wouldn't be a wise idea to use spitzer bullets in the magazine, ha!). It has a very nice bore with strong lands and grooves (especially considering it is about 115 years old!).

This was the main French battle rifle of World War I, and even saw limited service as late as World War II! This rifle is just filled with history!

The only major issue with it is the stock is obviously sanded and there is a crack in the stock that someone repaired fairly well years ago it would seem. However the Lebels are known for being heavily used and abused and it is difficult to find one in decent condition.

These are pretty difficult to find (which is why I bought it), especially in New York. I have never seen one at any of the gunshows I've gone to in the last few years. With the World War I 100 year anniversary coming up too no doubt these will be even harder to find at a decent price.

I'm selling this for $450, which is a good deal less than I paid for it. I will consider slightly lower offers. The only picture I have is off my cell phone since I no longer has access to a decent camera, ha! Go ahead and message me if you are at all interested. Thanks!

Rugers classifies it as a Standard Mini 14, of which not too commonly
found, since Ruger had already started the Ranch Rifle model of the Mini.
Further information on the rifle is Ruger shows it as 

Model: Mini-14/5
Shipped: May 2000

The wood furniture, including the top wood hand guard, which is no longer produced by Ruger is in beautiful condition. I currently have 2 other Mini's 
so I don't really need a third one, which is why I am offering this rifle for Trade or Sale. 

There has only been approximately 400 rds down the tube, 
no problems, it runs fine. The rear sight is of the older standard 
design Ruger put out basically a small peep sight flip. However
the flip part has been removed to allow the scope mount to fit.
the flip part is not included, but replacement can easily be found 
in Midway, Ruger USA, etc... if so desired.

The Mini 14 will come with the following;

1- 20rd Mag and 
1- 5rd Mag
New John Masen Muzzle Brake 
BEC INC Miradot 1x20m Red Dot Scope including mount
Nice basic Black Tactical case with it 
Older Ram-Line folding synthetic stock or Tapco Intrafuse Collapsible stock (Buyers choice) 


I would like to trade more so, but will sell if need be.

I am interested in Full Size Beretta 92FS or 1911 (No Glocks) or Military Rifles
doesn't hurt to make a offer, all I could do is politely decline...

Cash Price is $550

I prefer a FTF transaction and would be willing to travel a little to meet.
