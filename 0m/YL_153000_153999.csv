Both mags will be fully loaded with ammo.

It is in a like new condition. 

The AS trigger system of the Walther P99 has three possible carry modes: 

AS Mode The first is the AS mode which will automatically engage after a round is chambered. The trigger is fully forward, as if in double action, but the striker indicator is to the rear and visible. This mode offers the safety of carrying the P99 AS in single action with a light yet long trigger pull. 

DA Mode The second mode is Double Action. After a round is chambered, the decocking button can be depressed, releasing the striker into a double action trigger pull. In this mode the trigger is fully forward and the striker is at rest and no longer visible to the rear of the slide. After the trigger is first pulled, all subsequent shots will be in single action. This mode is considered, among fellow P99 AS owners, to be the safest mode to carry the AS in. 

SA Mode The third mode of carry for the P99 AS is Single Action. This mode can be achieved by chambering a round into the AS mode, then slowly pulling the trigger to the rear until you hear the SA portion of the sear engage. There will be an audio able click and the trigger will remain in the rear position. This mode will also automatically engage after the first trigger pull in double action mode. 


The barrel and slide have been hardness treated in the same manner that Glock has been, but Walther calls it by another trade name than Tennifer. 

I would like to trade for Walther P99C. Roind count at 200. No low ball offers please. 

Will trade for: Walther P99C, PPS, XDM, Kimber, Sig, HK, Beretta Inox, Judge (+/- cash as needed)

Let me know what you got, maybe we can trade, or $325.00 cash, if you
have no trade.
Thanks and God Bless our troops."

When I got it there was active rust on the slide, which I have tried to remove. (see pictures). Internals are good though; I disassembled it down to the last spring and pin to clean it up.
Gun comes with (2) 14 round magazines. One that seems to be factory and one I picked up that I think was made by KBI (Charles Daly).
Not gonna lie, this gun needs some work. It's no safe queen. Shooting Wolf 9mm I can get it through two magazines after a cleaning before it will jam. After that it does so about twice a mag. A competent gunsmith or an experienced amateur might be able to fix it, but I'm not that person, and I have no interest in putting money into it with the finish not 100%.
As a result, I don't expect much in a way of trade.

Rugers classifies it as a Standard Mini 14, of which not too commonly
found, since Ruger had already started the Ranch Rifle model of the Mini.
Further information on the rifle is Ruger shows it as 

Model: Mini-14/5
Shipped: May 2000

The wood furniture, including the top wood hand guard, which is no longer produced by Ruger is in beautiful condition. I currently have 2 other Mini's 
so I don't really need a third one, which is why I am offering this rifle for Trade or Sale. 

There has only been approximately 400 rds down the tube, 
no problems, it runs fine. The rear sight is of the older standard 
design Ruger put out basically a small peep sight flip. However
the flip part has been removed to allow the scope mount to fit.
the flip part is not included, but replacement can easily be found 
in Midway, Ruger USA, etc... if so desired.

I currently have a New John Masen Flash/Muzzle brake for it but have not
mounted it yet. If Buyer or Trader is interested in it also I would let it go for 
$15.00 extra. ( I just received it, so its not shown in the pictures)

The Mini 14 will come with the following;

1- 20rd Mag and 
1- 5rd Mag
BEC INC Miradot 1x20m Red Dot Scope including mount
Nice basic Black Tactical case with it 
Older Ram-Line folding synthetic stock. 

(The difference between this Ram-Line Stock and the current ones being produced is that its a little more studier and strong material and the stock shoulder piece also folds where as the current made models do not. (see picture)

I do have a Tapco Intrafuse collapsible stock available for it in Dark Earth color if the buyer would be interested in it, in place of the Ram Line stock. 


I would like to trade more so, but will sell if need be. 
I am interested in Military Rifles, M1 Garand, FN49, AK-47, AK-74, VZ 58, Hakim 8mm, or 1911 pistol or what ???

Trades should be of equal value or supplemented by cash, accessories, ammo, etc

Cash Price is $575

I prefer a FTF transaction and would be willing to travel a little to meet.
be if it has to be ship must be to FFL dealer and Buyer pays Shipping & Insurance extra.

for rifles I love just about everything other milsurps, cetmes, etc. I have a soft spot for swiss rifles, so k31s are always nice, if you have plenty of gp11 to throw in with it.

 but as always cash is king."

Up for sale is a Taurus 85 Ultralite Model #2-850129UL in 38 Special. This is a 5 shot ultimate carry revolver. The manufacture year was 2008 and the fit and function are flawless. THere are some wear marks on the frame and finish from being carried for a couple years but they are not tarnishes, rust, or pitting. It would be the perfect revolver to carry and not be afraid to abuse it a little. It's a ""spurless hammer"" action so the trigger pull is double action only. Super safe, super accurate. 

No trades. Face to Face in Colorado only. No bad guys, valid CO driver's license is required, CCW is preferred but not necessary. If you're Denver or FoCo best place for me to meet is Sportsman's Warehouse lot at I-25 and 34 in Loveland.

Adjusts, Removes & Installs Sights Without Damage

Safely moves fixed sights right or left in their dovetails without deforming slide or sight. Specifically designed for use with factory and aftermarket Tritium night sights, which are too fragile for the traditional hammer-and-punch sight installation method; works equally well with iron sights. Thumbscrew securely locks the slide so it’s fully supported in the rigid, machined aluminum body. Separate slots in the screw mechanism engage the sight and firmly, yet gently, concentrate screw force to loosen sights from even extremely tight dovetails. Hardened steel handle provides plenty of leverage, while self-lubricating, oil-impregnated Oilite® bronze bearings and extra-fine threads ensure smooth, precise movement."

The specs are available on the net.  I had a Badger Ordnance bolt knob professionally installed by a gunsmith.  It has about 200 rounds through it and the bbl was broken in for the first 100 rds (5 rds, cleaned until 50, then every 10 rds).  This is a great shooter with Federal match 168 and shoots better than the 3/4"" group shown below (100 yds). With a little practice, I now have a 100yd card with three  holes touching so this gun will do it.

The optic is a Premier Reticicles Heritage 3-15 power, with the Gen II mil dot with a single turn elevation knob and variable power illuminated reticle.  This is one of the top of the line scopes and is made for very long distance shooting.   Here is the website for specs:  http://www.premierreticles.com/products/

This scope is one of the scopes currently under contract to Marines, Army, and SOF for sniper and DMR weapons.

You can check out reviews at SWFA or any of the other sites that sell high-end optics.  SCOPE lists for $2880 on most sites.

The scope is mounted with a Badger Ordnance 0 degree rail and Badger Ordnance low rings.  Factory and aftermarket caps are included.

Bipod is not included

I'll include a mil-dot instruction book and ballistic cards for the Federal 168gr match round, and 500 rounds of match ammo.

Case is an Eagle Industries drag bag without the shroud on the end.

This is a very well set up gun and does 1/4""MOA without further mods if you do your part; it shoots better than I do.

Looking for Colt or SIG high-end 1911 or SIG 229/220

Several of you have asked about the gun w/o optic.  Gun, case, bone, and ammo are 1600. or I'll go 1400 without the ammo.    I keep the scope and rings.  You'll be wishing you bought the scope though!"

Smith & Wesson 586 (no dash); 6 shot .357 magnum, 6"" barrel; Hogue monogrips.

I traded for this, and only took it to the range once. The trigger is amazingly smooth, so it shoots great, but I can't quite get used to how front heavy it is. Therefore, I would like for it to find a loving home, instead of living in my safe.

It is in very nice condition, the bluing looks great, the only flaws I can find are some very light scratches on the front 2"" of the barrel, and some slight discoloration on the muzzle end. They aren't big enough for me to get them to show up in the pictures. I took pictures under a variety of lighting conditions, but it is hard to capture the nice gloss of the blue.

Depending on condition, these appear to go on Gunbroker for $400 (crappy looking) to $700 (great, with nice wood grips). 
I think $500 would be fair for this one. 

I am open to the following trades:
9mm Handguns
.45 ACP Handguns
.357 or .45 ACP revolvers, preferably stainless, with a 4"" or shorter barrel

942,http://www.armslist.com/posts/153942,For Sale/Trade:  WTT/WTS IOTV GenII ACU Med w/ Soft Armor + Plates,"North Denver Area, Denver, Colorado","$ 1,200","Listed On: Sunday, June 26, 2011",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"IMPROVED OUTER TACTICAL VEST 
IOTV GENERATION 2, BODY ARMOR
COMPLETE WITH SOFT ARMOR & PLATES
DATED 12/2009, UNWORN, MEDIUM

This is the first of the Gen 2 Vests I have seen and these are few and far between. It shows No signs of ever being worn. 

Vest Includes:
•	Vest with all soft armor inserts and quick release system, 12/2009, Medium fits Chest 37-41
•	Front and Back Collars, 12/2009
•	Groin Protector and Lower Back Protector with inserts, 12/2009
•	Internal Waistband
•	Right and Left “Wing” assemblies, (MOLLE Waistband/Cumberbund)
•	Side Plate Carriers/Pouches
•	DAPS with inserts, Both dated 2007

If you held the Generation I & II vests side by side, it might be hard to tell the difference. For operators in the field, however, even a set of subtle changes can have far-reaching effects. 
The Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) incorporates new utility features and design enhancements which provide lightweight comfort and maximum protection. All of IOTV’s improvements result in a fully integrated vest that not only offers the most advanced protection available but greater maneuverability for mission effectiveness.

•	One change set involved expanding vertical adjustment of the side plate carriers, and allowing horizontal changes. This allows IOTV to properly fit a wider variety of soldier sizes, including women.
•	The Gen II design converted back to Cordura for mesh, because the previous material was so “aggressive” that it was damaging the uniform underneath. 
•	Streamlining the quick release cable handle to reduce pinch-points or friction, so it can weigh less and work better.
•	More than three pounds lighter than OTV
•	Lower back extender protects the lower spine region and increases the vest’s coverage by 52 square inches
•	Internal waistband enhances mobility by distributing the weight from the shoulders to the waist and helps stabilize the load
•	The other major Generation II change involves D-Ring attachments on the front, to make additional gear easier including a load-bearing system (Tactical Assault Panel, Not Included) that goes beyond MOLLE velcro’s holding capacity
