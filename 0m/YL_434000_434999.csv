I bought this rifle last year and have exactly 280 rounds through it (+3 rounds from the factory certification). This rifle was bought in the ""sporter"" config and was converted to the AK style set up as most people recognize it. The rifle is in terrific shape and was cleaned and properly maintained after shooting sessions. When I converted it I blasted off the crummy factory finish and had the gun professionally duracoated. The factory certificate reads 113mm spread at 100 yards but it has tightened since the conversion to ~ 95 or so. This Saiga was the IZ 332 with the regular forend and is all correct Russian manufacture with 24mm threads. The furniture is Ironwood designs ""Baltic birch"" that finished with shellac for that authentic Russian appearance (the shown photographs of the rifle were ironwood handguards and Bulgarian stock, but does include the ironwood stock) However, the photos do it no justice as it came out really nice looking. Overall, I would say the rifle is 98% due to some wear on the finish from handling. The gun is 8lbs unloaded, has a bullet guide installed, G2 trigger and has preformed flawlessly. I am also including the original furniture, three 30 round polymer mags + a bakelite Izmash 30 round mag and last but not least 720 rounds of non corrosive 123 gr Russian manufacture ammunition. The only caveat about the rifle is since converting it I have been using a rakurs optic so I took off the rear 100-300 meter sporter sight and was going to replace it with a true AK rear sight for authenticity, I have the sight but forgot to order the adjustment bar. The part costs about 2 dollars and snaps right in so it shouldn't be too big of a deal. This rifle is nice, with the accessories and ammo I feel that 700 is a fair deal so I am sticking to 700$ firm. I would PREFER a face to face deal, BUT I will ship but you have to cover costs for the ammo and gun + Paypal fee of . If interested please Email me at [email]REDACTED[/email]"

If you like more of a ""rifle feel"" and the Siminov design, but think the integral 10-round is inadequate or obsolete, this is a great rifle for you. 

I'd like an AK-47, any condition as far as appearance, scratches, etc. All that matters is that it functions reliably.  Century Arms, Yugoslavian, etc., it doesn't matter, as long as it is the Kalashnikov design.

I would consider selling instead of trading, for the right price. 
Everything is negotiable, worst I can do is say no.
I will upload pics soon. E-mail me for my number, or any questions.

I would also love an AR, I would be willing to add in some money for a trade for an AR. Or a Mini 14 or anything similar.  Must be .223/.556, 7.62x39, or .308.

The first one that sells, I'm keeping the other, so it's your choice.
The first:

Sig Sauer P226 9mm Blackwater Tactical. This Blackwater Tactical is no longer in business and this Item is discontinued. The Blackwater Tactical is a full sized 9MM with a stainless slide with rugged wear resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE rear night sight, a Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and features a short reset trigger (SRT)that is 60% shorter for faster return and better control during faster shooting. The beaver-tail frame is hard anodized light weight with integral Picatinny rail.The slide comes with Blackwater logo on top and the grips are also engraved with the Blackwater logo.Some of the Blackwaters features are a custom mag well, double action trigger is 10.0 lbs, single is 4.4 lbs, length is 7.7"",width1.5"", height 5.5"",Barrel 4.4"", sight radius 6.3"", weight with mag 34.0 oz., mag cap. 20 w/ 4 mags.
I believe they started production of the Blackwater Tactical in 2009 and ended in 2010. This is a Blackwater TACTICAL, it is one of the very few that does not have front slide serrations, because it is one of the first ones produced, then they changed the design. This was manufactured in Jan. 2009. You can confirm this with a toll free call to Sig Sauer.
This has had 75 rounds shot thru one magazine. The 3 other 20-round magazines are still sealed in factory packaging.
This firearm is immaculate, all factory packaging and paperwork.
$1300 firm

The second:

A Sig p226 that was made in the 80's in West Germany
Manual's primary language is in German, and the original factory target is in German
Comes with original box, manual, factory target and the 2 original 15 round magazines.
This too is immaculate

Below is the factory description of the PS90. 

The FN PS90 Triple Rail (TR) gives the operator a wide choice of sighting accessories via its three MIL-STD 1913 rails for mounting optional optical sights, tactical lights and lasers. Chambered in the 5.7x28mm cartridge, the PS90 utilizes straight blowback operation and fires from a closed bolt for greater accuracy and reliability. The PS90’s civilian legal 16.04"" cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel is equipped with an integrated muzzle brake to reduce recoil. Dual magazine latches, cocking handles and an innovative matte black synthetic thumbhole stock with a molded-in sling attachment point help make the PS90 fully ambidextrous.

This model has the scandium alloy full sized frame with the commander size slide/barrel (4.25 inches).

It has around 300-400 rounds fired through it and shoots straighter than my full size sig sauer.  There are some wear spots but its black so you have to expect some things to show up.  I absolutely love this gun and my only reason for selling is that I had a custom 1911 on order for almost a year and it finally came in.  The picture shows some VZ grips on it that I might consider adding for the right offer.  Stock rosewood grips will be included either way.  I have a few more pictures that I can supply upon request.

Everyone needs to beware of someone going by bulletproof007@gmail.com. This is a scam! I did a Google search and found some complaint forums and someone else on this site has posted a warning as well. He wants money first, and then he will send the gun. I believe he uses many different emails but I'm afraid to list them bc of fear these just may be coincedence. They all use the same wording and diction. All emails start with ""I have this exact gun"" He is always ""a military man so you know who you are dealing with. Shipping will be no problem"" He even offers to send a picture of his ID, which is a fake. He is always needing money in a hurry. One time his 'Mum' was sick. He will never meet for a FTF transaction even though he claimed to live 20 min away from me and the nearest FFL is 30 min away. Be careful"

* I can email you better pictures I can't shrink them enough to put on here *

The Gun: CZ 242 .22kal ( yes kal not cal ) bolt action single shot rifle. There was 100,000 made before the factory was shut down in 1943  and retooled to make the famous Mauser for the Nazi war effort. The action is all machined and very well made. The original rear site has been replaced. It has about a 22-24"" barrel. It seems to be adult sized opposed to being a small person trainer.

The Paint Job.
First off the action and barrel are only Krylon tan camo. The surface had become rough with patina, so I sanded it smooth with steel wool. Leaving the blue and spray painted it, Wipe it off in 5 mins with any walmart solvent. 

Stock, It's  not nearly that yellow in real life.it's two shades of tan. It was painted two layers of acrylic paint the added about 5 coats of polyurethane It looks like skulls close up but 5ft away it looks like British desert DPM camo

If your buying for your kid. I also have a 1970's wood US Army footlocker painted in the same exact skull pattern I will sell for a $100 Every young Zombie Hunter needs a hope (you don't die) chest to store his lethal tools in."

GLOCK 26

""Baby"" Glock

The triumphant advance of the smallest GLOCK pistol, specially developed for concealed carry and previously a domain of 5-round snub nose revolvers, started with the presentation of the GLOCK 26 in August 1994. The GLOCK 26 offers more than an alternative in this field. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds as standard and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain the worldwide distribution among security personnel and secret services.

For Sale for $1,200 obo (seriously obo, the worst i can say is no so go ahead and offer up)

SW45. This is a H&K MP5K Clone, but it is chambered in .45ACP. This weapon was made by Special Weapons (out of Arizona). It takes modified Grease Gun Mags of which there are 5. I am the 3rd owner, the first two shot less than 100 rounds through it, and i have shot less than 500 through it. I had 4 clips made for it but two of them need a little more work done as the gunsmith moved away before he could finish tweaking them. If your looking for a rare, weapon that has some decent knock-down power this is a one for you. 

Well i found another gunsmith, who found out that the problem was actually the extractor so he fixed it for me, i took it in for a check up after i had it fixed and he confirmed his work. 

I also have access to MANY products like trijicon, aim point, crimson trace and Eotech to name a few... 

You will receive: 
-SW45 
-5x 30rnd Clips 
-Sling 
-Carry Case

This rifle has great reviews, known as the AK of the AR world.  This is a piston driven AR type rifle.  It has an adjustable gas system to accommodate firing the weapon in a dirty state.  The rifle charges from the side to alleviate the top charging issues found on most ARs.  The lower reciever is more open for easier cleaning and there is also no star chamber.  The folding stock allows for easy storage.  I also have the original stock parts.  The EOTech has a 1 MOA center dot and a 65 MOA ring around that.  EOTechs are well known for there reliability and sturdiness.  The Surefire light on this rifle is also a dependable light, not sure of the brightness but you can use it as a hammer if you need to.  It has the tail cap that can accept a pressure switch.  Interested in trades of other quality ARs that are 556 or 308 or cash. Can send more pictures on request."

This is a 20 gauge Rossi Overland Coach Gun, external hammers, 20"" barrels, in excellent condition. The bores show absolutely no sign of being fired, and I can see any indication on the breech face, hammers, or firing pins. I believe it to be unfired. There are a couple of minor bruises in the wood, but certainly nothing to worry about. Has the original Rossi butt plate. The 20 gauge Rossis are really neat because instead of just putting 20 gauge barrels on the 12 gauge frame, the frame is proportionally smaller. In one photo I show this gun compared to my 12 gauge gun so you can see the difference. The 12 gauge is on the top in the photo.

I have lots of photos so you can see the details. Send me a note and I'll send you the link to them.

These older Rossis are the perfect Cowboy Action shotgun because they don't have the extra, unnecessary and annoying, crossbolt safety, and they work great. This one is especially nice."

-No shipping, in person only.
-I don't mind travelling a reasonable distance.
-If you'd like any additional information, feel free to email me!
-I forgot to mention, a previous owner lightened the trigger pull significantly, it feels like a S&W trigger.

I changed the listing to FS/FT now! The cheapest I have seen these new is $500, and that doesn't include shipping (between $20-$50). So I think $400 + FFL transfer charge is a reasonable price.
