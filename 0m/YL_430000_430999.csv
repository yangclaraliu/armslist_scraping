It consisted of a complete PSA upper (I think they test fire a couple rds) and complete PSA lower which were put together to make a complete rifle. The barrel is a 1/7 twist CMV steel barrel with the M4 cuts. The BCG is a FA carrier with a MPI tested bolt. The lower has the Magpul enhanced aluminum trigger guard. The fit and finish is really nice and dark and free of blemishes. . I have never had any issues with any rifles I have had from PSA. They seem to put out a nice product at a reasonable price point.

In 2011 the cartridge reached the 120 years in service mark. The 7.62×54mmR is currently (2011) mainly used in sniper rifles like the Dragunov sniper rifle and machine guns like the PKM. The ballistic performance is similar with the .308 Winchester/7.62×51mm NATO cartridge. The .30-06 Springfield cartridge (7.62x63 mm) with its higher service pressure and case capacity outperforms the 7.62×54mmR, especially when same length test barrels are used in this comparison. Even when comparing a 24 inch barrel .30-06 Springfield to a 28 inch barrel 7.62×54mmR, the latter still is more in line with the .308 Winchester but a handful of modern loads of the 7.62×54mmR nearly reach the 30-06's power.No local pick up. items will be shipped.And no trades please"

333,http://www.armslist.com/posts/430333,For Sale:  Counter Sniper Rifle,"Oregon, Oregon, United States",$ 950,"Listed On: Monday, June 11, 2012",Rifles,Winchester                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,no type,Rifle,"I have for sale or possible trade a Patriot Arms Counter Sniper rifle chambered in 308. This rifle is the crown jewel of my gun collection. The actual build is called Counter Sniper and the weapon is marked as such. The rifle was built by Bob Randazzo, the previous owner of Patriot Arms about 12 years ago. This is a true custom 1000 yard rifle. You can get rifles in 338 lapua or 416 that will shoot further, but if you are looking for a 308 Winchester rifle I’m told you can’t do better than this one

I obtained the rifle used and at the time of purchase I was told the rifle was built for a member of the US Olympic Shooting team. The rifle has a lot, and I do mean a lot of custom work and features done to it. The rifle was built to create ½ inch groups from 400 yards away. I have found some literature online to substantiate this, apparently Bob Randazzo built some really amazing weapons. This is a true counter sniper rifle, when the first shot really, really counts and saves lives. I am not remotely close to being a good enough rifle shooter to take advantage of the rifles capabilities and where I live there is no rifle range longer than 120 meters. So I hope the rifle ends up with a fanatical second amendment supporter who will cherish it and love it as I have. I personally put less than 100 rounds through the rifle, and the trigger and feel of the rifle are amazing…

The rifle has features including the following:

-Trued action: The action is very, very tight. Each round sits exactly is the same place every single time, this way each shot is consistent.

-Lapped bolt: please look at the pictures of the bolts head. It is lapped so that it makes perfect contact with the chamber. Lapping is a very slow and laborious process and used only on the highest end guns.

-Scope mounts serial numbered to rifle: The piccatiny base mounts were build by Bob Randazzo at the same time as the rifle, they have been contoured to match the contour of the receiver perfectly. I was told this process increases surface contact area by 100%. You will never need to remove the bases as these are the best bases money can buy for this rifle.

-Bolt Body and Handle Serial numbered to rifle: Please look at the pictures and see the serial numbers on them, everything was custom fitted by hand to produce a perfect fit so that each round is set in exactly the same place for each shot, that is how a custom rifle can produce half inch groups from 400 yards.

-Sako Extractor: Please look at the pictures, again, the sako extractor was custom fitted to this bolt. This is the same type of extractor used on a Sako TRG42, much, much better and heavier than standard Remington extractors.

-Jewel trigger: the trigger is custom too. This is by far the most amazing trigger I have ever felt. The rifle is set for long range shooting 500 yards and out and the trigger is set for less than one pound, if you touch it, it fires with no distortion transferred to the rest of the rifle. The trigger is fully adjustable and has three adjustment screws, but in my humble opinion it is perfect as is now. If you would like to adjust it for higher weight you may do so.

-Jewel Safety: The safety has been custom fitted to this rifle too, it is very crisp and precise, and same color as the trigger.

-Magazine conversion: I have taken extensive pictures of the magazine. The rifle has a four round external mag that fits flush to the stock.

-McMillan stock and bedding: This is not your run of the mill McMillan stock. While most stocks are symmetrical this one is not. The grip is not symmetrical but is instead contoured to the palm of a human hand. I had no idea this feature would make the rifle so much of a better fit in my hand. The stock is molded for the shooters hand, the grip is very, very natural, improving the accuracy of long range shots. The stock was a special order one and makes the rifle much easier to point while you are lying on the ground or if you are shooting from a bench as the wrist is not out of alignment as it would be with a symmetrical stock. The stock also has a build it cheek rest.

-Decelerator shoulder pad: Please look at the pictures, the pad is very thick and quite soft, it does an amazing job absorbing recoil. I have never had any bruising or bluing in my shoulder, this stock works great.

-Shirleen match barrel: This was not an off the shelf custom barrel. I was told this company is out of business now but they made some very, very high end barrels which were cryologically frozen during the manufacturing process so that the atoms would align better in the metal. I was told the barrel is made out of stainless steel. The barrel has an aggressive crown muzzle and is very heavy.

-Baer Scope Rings 30mm: I was told these are exceptionally good rings, not Les Baer rings but Baer Custom Rifles rings. Each screw that grips the rings to the mount has a perfect stop marked by the white dots. Please note how perfectly the white dots line up on each of the base screws. The proportions on the base and rings are so accurate everything lined up perfectly as can be seen by the alignment of the white dots. The white dots also serve a visual confirmation that everything is tight on the base, if got forbid a screw moves the dots would not be perfectly aligned anymore and you would know to torque it down.

-Leopold One Inch Scope Rings: If you choose to downsize your scope later to a one inch tube scope you will have a perfect set of rings to do so. These rings have actually already been lapped to a scope mounted on this rifle so you just need to mount them again to get a perfect fit. The rings have been lapped so that they don’t distort or scare the scope tube when mounted. They are truly amazing rings.

- Harris Bi-pod: The bipod has several stops instead of the cheaper srew stops they have now days. This is a very, very nice bipod that can accommodate almost any shooting angle or elevation.

-Tasco Custom Shop 8-40x56 target rifle scope. This is the best scope tasco ever made and in 1995 they retailed for $1300. the scope was made by Hakko in Japan. Hakko made all Colt and Springfield Government Spec scopes. This scope is of the same quality. The scope is very clear and with 30mm tube. It has a very easy to use parallax adjustment which makes focusing the scope a breeze at any distance. Again, this is an awesome scope, probably one of the most under rated scopes out there. The japs knew what they were doing when it came to optics. This scope is in quality just like the Springfield Armory Government scopes that army snipers use. It was made by the same people at the same factory with the same materials, except this one retailed for three times what the Government scopes sold for.

I am not a weapons expert but I have tried really hard to explain the rifle to the best of my abilities. My area of expertise is structured finance and not high end custom rifles, yet I have tried to explain the features the way they were explained to me when I acquired the rifle. This is an amazing weapon but unfortunately my capabilities are far, far short of the rifles potential. I hope the next enthusiast who owns it ends winning a gold medal for our great country with it. The rifle probably has some other custom work done to it which escapes my memory right now...

This weapon system is an amazing package. I hope it ends up with a hedge fund manager or an executive or someone for whom the price of ammo will not be an issue and they will be able to shoot it a lot. Again, you can get larger caliber rifles that will cost you between $5-$10 a pop and beat you up with recoil but if you are looking for a 308 rifle I wholeheartedly believe one can’t do any better than this one. The US Army and armed forces all over the world use the 308 Winchester round to engage targets over 1000 yards away, if you are a good enough shot this rifle will represent you honorably from 1000 yards away… I wish I was a good enough shot and had a long enough range to test it at that distance. I hope whomever gets it has access to a 500+ yards range and a really, really nice gun vice so they can see what the rifle can do.must be shipped to an FFL,no trades pls"

Not a FTF or FTE or any sort of malfunction from the XD9 in 650 rounds. It will include up to 5 mags. If trading a Bersa I will include all the mags I have for a total of 5, otherwise it depends on the mags you have if trading an XD sub compact 9. If trading a Bersa I would like at least 2 mags with the firearm if possible...but it is not a deal breaker. It has some light handling marks (note: the melonite finish is not missing) that I have tried to show in the pictures. Otherwise it is as clean as a whistle. 

Looking to trade for one of those specifically as I have a pair of aftermarket sights that will be going on the firearm that I trade for. I am willing to drive a bit (60 miles or so) if you are coming from a distance away to help us both mitigate costs. All applicable state and federal laws apply (i.e. waiting period, valid FOID card, proper documentation)

I will send additional pictures of the XD9 to anybody with serious interest if desired."

Spikes Tactical Elite 14.5"" FN 249 SAW double chromed barrel. ** Mid-Length gas system for added shot placement and less recoil **

**14.5"" FN Cold Hammer Forged barrel with permanently attached Vortex Flash Hider making it civilian legal 
**** 1:7"" twist barrel is extremely durable with a 20,000+ round service life. *** Barrel is turned to Spike's New Optimum barrel Profile. This profile is lighter than government profile but beefier than a lightweight profile. *** Spike's HPT/MPI NICKEL BORON COATED M16 Bolt Carrier Group. *** The furniture is Magpul MOE. ** The MBUS flip up rear sight is a perfect mate to the front A2 sight.

The Bolt Carrier Group specs are as follows:
    * Machined from 8620 Tool Steel (Carrier) and 158 Carpenter Steel (Bolt)
    * Shrouded firing pin.
    * NICKEL BORON Coating inside AND out (Bolt, Carrier, and Gas Key)
    * Forged Mil-Spec gas key attached with Grade 8 hardware and Properly staked.

** The lower is a SunDevil billet lower cut from solid billet which is more durable and stronger then standard AR receiver material.
** It features custom selector markings which are:

FIRE=Mars/God of War icon****
The single-stage trigger has been tuned to break at what feels like 5-5-1/2lbs, clean with virtually no creep and quick reset for faster follow up shots. *** The Hogue pistol grip is an added bonus as it provides greater comfort, less fatigue and greater control. ***

My wife fell in love shooting one of my 226s. She told me I had better not sell that one. Well...............I sold it some time ago.

Was going through a rough time financially. I keep several guns in my brothers safe. So she doesn't see them anyway. i would like to replace it now. But I really don't even want another, just doing it for her and I guess you could say for me. 

Anyway, I don't want to put a fortune in one. CPO would be fine, well shot would be fine as long as it's not overly beat up. It must be railed, it must be a 9mm, must be Nitron (black). Don't need a bunch of mags, just one will do. Don't even care if it comes with a box. 

If you have something reasonable or know where one is at let me know. Seems like if I'm buying one they are expensive, if I'm selling one their worthless."

These are impossible to find new since they are no longer made, and far nicer than the MK IIIs.

Why a MK II over a MK III?  Look it up on Google for details.  The MK III has enough internal safeties and that mag disconnect that makes lawyers smile and shooter cringe.  A manual safety is enough (which the MK II has).  This is why the MK II is a far better and more reliable choice.  Plus, it is a collector's item"

Brand new never used.  Price is $265 shipped priority mail.  

If you’re looking for the finest BCG on the market today, search no more! This is the same Mil-Spec BCG that we sell but the only difference is that it’s coated in Nickel Boron to our specs by FailZero using their EXO Technology. And yes, it’s High Pressure Tested and Magnetic Particle Inspected (HPT/MPI)

Nickel Boron has proven itself to be the most durable finish on the market. It’s much smoother than Hard Chrome, it’s easier to clean, makes the rifle cycle smoother, it can be run almost lube free for thousands of rounds, and it will never chip, peal, or flake off! Because of these benefits, Nickel Boron is being adopted by the Military as well as many Government agencies. As you can see, these BCGs are a huge improvement over a standard Phosphate BCG and it’s even an improvement over Hard Chrome.

Upgrade to a better BCG today. You won’t be sorry!

This gun is a fairly rare piece, a .22 LR Rossi SXS double barrel with double triggers and rabbit ear hammers. Push a button and the breech snaps open and the shells are automatically extracted (need to be removed manually). This uses rebounding firing pins as on a number of antique shotguns. Very cool little pistol that looks like an antique, but these were manufactured by Rossi in the 1940s and 1950s. No chips or noticeable scratches or dings in the bright nickle finish. Pistol was oiled, test fired, and cleaned with CLP (never use Hoppes 9 on a nickel plated gun). I was surprised by the accuracy of this piece. I bought the Rossi a few days ago and just don't like the way it feels in my hand.  Came with a partial box of old Winchester ammo (30+ rds), and I'll include that as well as some NEW Federal and CCI HPs (17 rds) and a full 20 rd box of CCI shotshells ($8). Loaded with shotshells, this is the world's smallest double-barreled shotgun. I'm asking $250 for the Rossi and ammo.  Not particularly interested in trades.  This is a very cool functional curio/range toy/conversation piece and a great addition to any collection.

[b]Item Description:[/b] I am selling my mint Nambu. It comes with one mag with matching serial number and one mag with a differing serial number. Also an original holster. All numbers on the pistol are matching. The pistol is dated 8-1944. 

A little history...

The origins of the Nambu pistol series goes back to a design by Lieutenant General Kijiro Nambu.[2] General Nambu claimed the design originated with experimentation during the ""30 year Automatic Pistol Plan"" of 1897 in Japan.[1] It is more probable that the pistol series was influenced by the Mauser C96, after a Japanese commission toured Europe and reported recent developments. The first Nambu type known as the Type A was completed in 1902.[1] The Type A underwent trials with the Imperial Japanese Army but was never formally adopted.[1] Many Original Type As were sold commercially to China and Siam.[1] Coinciding with British customs, Japanese army officers were expected to purchase their own side arms.[2] The Nambu Type A pistol was adopted by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1909 and the Thai Army in the 1920s.[2]

Most of the Type A and Type B Nambu pistols were produced by the Tokyo Arsenal with a few pistols being produced by the Tokyo Gas and Electric Company.[1] The Type 14 Nambu was produced by the Nagoya Arsenal in either Nagoya's Atsuta or Toriimatsu factories.[3]

The pistol was retired from service when Japan was disarmed after World War II. Many were taken home by Allied servicemen as war trophies after World War II. Many have found their way into collectors markets in America and western Europe.

The ""Type 14 Nambu"" was designed in 1925 with the goal of simplifying manufacturing to reduce cost.[6] It was officially adopted for issue to non-commissioned officers in the Japanese Army in 1927 and was available for purchase by officers.[6] The Type 14 was an improved version of the Type A Nambu. The Type 14 has similar About 279,000 Type 14s were produced. Later production models are distinguished by an enlarged, oblong shaped trigger guard (which was introduced after Japanese soldiers reported difficulty in accessing the trigger while wearing gloves in the cold Soviet far east) and sometimes have a knurled steel cocking knob instead of the standard ""slotted"" cocking knob. The redesigned cocking knob was implemented in 1944 in order to simplify production. The Type 14 also lacks the grip safety used on the previous models.

One quality of the Type 14 caught the eye of William B. Ruger who had acquired a captured Nambu from a returning US Marine, shortly after World War II ended in 1945.[5] Ruger duplicated two Nambus in his garage,[8] and although he decided against marketing them, the handgun's rear cocking device and the Nambu's silhouette was incorporated into one of the most popular .22 semi-automatic pistols to ever enter the US firearms market, when in 1949 the Ruger Standard (and later Mark I, II, and III) pistols were sold to the US public

I then fell into a finical rut and I don't have the time or money to put into the flip. I paid about $8,000 cash for it and then paid $1,100 cash to have it hauled here to NC. I have right at $9,000 invested and would at least like to break even. I'm in a bind and really need to sell it. The backhoe runs great and the motor is in good shape. On the other hand, the hydraulics need some work and I really don't have the time, money or skill to put towards it. If you have the time and money to put into it, this would be a great deal or you may even be able to flip it yourself and make a profit. This model in fair condition with the same hours is worth around $12,000. I figure it needs about $1,000 to get it right. That leaves around a $1,500 to $2,000 profit. My loss, your gain. This is a MUST SELL situation! Please contact me through email if you or someone you know may be interested. Emails go straight to my phone so expect a quick response.
