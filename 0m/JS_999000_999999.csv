This is a Winchester Model 1873 .22 Short Rifle that I inherited from my Grandfather. It was purchased by my Great Grandfather when it was brand new and was used as a farm gun on a routine basis. So, this wasn't just a gun that sat around collecting dust and it wasn't a collectors item! Serial Number is 524753. According to the Winchester website, the serial number shows it was manufactured in 1898. However, the numbers on the barrel does not match but is from a gun made in 1881. The barrel doesn;t even say the word Winchester on it, but it is! Straight up, this rifle is in rough shape but, it still fires true! I have shot it! In mint condition I know for a fact these are appraised at up to $15,000. However, I know this rifle is far from it and is truely in need of an owner who would appreciate its beauty.

The rifle has a full-octagon barrel and Third Style receiver with integral dust cover rail and dust cover with serrated edges. The barrel has a dovetail mounted sporting style front sight with silver bead and a sporting style rear sight. The barrel, magazine, forearm cap and receiver appear to have had the bluing stripped off and the hammer, lever and crescent buttplate are casehardened. The stock and forearm are straight grain black walnut with a varnish finish. "".22 CAL/SHORT"" is stamped in script letters on the bottom of the brass cartridge elevator. The upper receiver tang is roll-stamped ""MODEL 1873"". The serial number ""524753B"" is stamped on the lower tang between the lever latch and the tang screw. 
BBL: 22 inch octagon 
Stock: walnut 
Gauge: 22 short 
Finish: It appears that someone has attempted to strip and sand down the finish. My Grandfather did it!
 Condition: Poor to Fair. This rifle was used routinly as a farm rifle for hunting, pest control, and self defense. It has character to say the least. It is missing some of the original parts such as the finger lever spring and screw, the carrier lever spring and screw, and I think the mag tube needs some work. It whole gun needs work for sure. Plenty to keep you busy. It would be great as a project or as a parts gun. I am firm on the price $750. Rifle sold AS-IN condition.

Listen, THIS RIFLE IS NOT MINT!!!! Its in crappy condition! I have photos posted at www.arrivalband/bodie
Look at them first before contacting me with 10,000 questions. Its a pretty big zip file, so give it some time, okay.

I will NOT ship this gun till I have cash in my hand thru PayPal or bank certified money order. You must pay shipping costs through FedEx or UPS. The last jerkoff who backed out lived in North Dakota and 3 day UPS was only $40. I will give you the cost after you give me your zipcode. Its not alot! I will NOT ship overseas. I can meet you here in Ohio within reason if you live here. I will take no lower then $750. Hell, I can fix this thing myself if I want but I would rather dump it right now. Hell, I have actually thought about  making the barrel 16 inches anyway!!! It would knock off about 3 lbs off the muzzle!!! Man, for a 22 its pretty damn heavy! 10 lbs.

i can possibly include an original thumbhole stock, as it is a slant cut receiver, ironwood designs also makes a very nice type 56 set for the slant cut MAK too

this is 100% parts matching, roughly 600-800 rounds through it

the chinese guns have banned from importation since 1994, thats why the market isnt flooded with them like WASR's that are marginal at best

$1000 is pretty firm, partial trades considered, email for more pics, im steadily getting more as people ask questions

a chinese type 56, is one of the best AK's you can buy, the WASR that is currently being imported , is bottom of the barrel. type 56 guns have 1.5mm receivers instead of 1.0mm like a WASR, the finish and machining is MUCH better, they are 100% made , not parts guns like a WASR. they were assembled for military use, not made for export like a WASR
they were intended to be a military gun that takes 30 round mags, not wallowed out with a dremel, and then weld bits of sheet metal to keep the mag from falling out like a WASR. MAK uses mag dimples, the CORRECT way to hold a mag in place
MAK uses  double hook style trigger, no a finger slapping single hook, and the stock MAK trigger is SMOOTHER than the tapco g2

please do your research, when you email me comparing a $900 WASR to my gun.

there is NO comparison

sorry for the rant, thank you"

I added the rail, muzzle break,BSA scope, laser, and flashlight all new last summer. It comes with the stock 10 shot clip, and 3-30 shot clips and about 100 rounds of ammo.  Scope has a twist dust cover front and back.   This gun has extremely high reviews, and is near impossible to find (please feel free to google it). Kel Tec cant even keep up with orders years BEFORE the threat of the new bans. Its design broke the mold in the .223 market. If you like ""bump shooting"" this is the one for you.

This is law enforcement duty ammo new in the box. auction is for five boxes, 250 rounds. Speer Gold Dot Ammunition continues dominating the law enforcement community. Its proven reliability for tough jobs has made it the #1 duty ammunition on the market today. To put it simply, it's the best. Gold Dot was the first high-performance handgun ammunition to be loaded with true, bonded-core bullets. Using our exclusive Uni-Cor process, we bond the jacket to the core one molecule at a time. This virtually eliminates core-jacket separation, the leading cause of handgun bullet failures and often inherent in the design of conventional bullets. Our bonding happens at the beginning of the bullet making process, exactly where it should. We form the hollow point cavity in two stages. The first establishes how far the bullet can expand; the second controls the rate of expansion. This patented* two-step cavity formation gives Speer engineers incredible control in the design process. Each bullet caliber and weight is tuned for optimum expansion and penetration. The bullet is finished to provide a smooth profile for reliable feeding in semi-auto handguns. Gold Dot is assembled in quality brass cases, nickelplated for smooth feeding and protection from corrosion. For sure-fire ignition under real-world conditions, we use famous CCI primers. Then we load select, low-flash propellants matched to the performance needs of each cartridge. We put a lot of thought into each Gold Dot cartridge so you no longer have to."

Why is this so much more than all the other plain black G17's selling for $625 plus tax?

Because this Talo Edition is extremely rare. Do us both a favor and please search on Armslist nationwide (simply use the search block in the upper right corner of this screen), Gun Broker, Guns America, all over the web. I encourage you to read the reviews and do you homework. I do not want you to make an impulse buy just because this is a great looking gun. It is a step above and apart from all the other G17 on the market today.

If you want the best Glock 17 available, and are ready to buy, then contact me with your name and number. Until then, thanks for looking.

I purchased the gun new 3 years ago. I took it to a local gunsmith to have the above modifications made. He also Duracoated it for me. It was polished stainless when I bought it. 
You can see that some of the finish is wearing. This is primarily due to the fact that I carry the gun, it doesn't just sit in a safe or on a shelf. This gun has been worked. I've run maybe 3000 rounds through it, and it's just as reliable and shoots just as straight as it ever has."

Model number 1890 and serial number 255135.  As far as I can research it seems to have been made in 1905.  My husbands uncle gave it to him when he was about 10 (he is now 76).  

The rifle is in decent shape with some expected wear and tear on the wood stock.  There are two screws missing, one on the pump handle and one on the trademark plate.  There are two marks on the lock just above the hammer and my husband thinks they are shot marks.  Also, the extractor is worn so the spent cartridges won't extract.  The last time we shot this rifle was about seven years ago.

The rifle has been cleaned through the years but we have not cleaned it in the most recent years.  A man who regularly goes to gun shows told us not to ""clean it up"" before we try to sell it at a gun show, which we haven't gone to as of yet, so we have not given the rifle a good cleaning.  Having said that, it's has been in our closet for years so it just need a little attention!"

I figure that my package in the current market is worth around $1600 or so. That gives most AK's fair current market value and maybe even a little more so your gun must be an eye catcher. I will need pics before I even meet up so as to not waste either one of our time. Here are some pics.

I will also sell this package for $1600 OBO. Then I can just buy the AK that I want."

The first item is a barrel that came with the kit. It is a 28 inch barrel for 2 and 3/4 & 3 in shells. It says on the box it came in that it is a ""Mod 1"" whatever that means. I bought this gun package from a guy that dad died and had it in his safe with the 500a kit. All I need is the shotgun with the short barrel. I want to trade or sell the rest. I do not believe this barrel has ever been shot, its a little dusty but looks clean.
The second item is the OEM factory pistol grip that came with the model 500a kit. Its a tad faded from age but you really cant tell. It comes with the original allen bolt and washers that attach it to the reciever of the model 500a. The kit that these two items come from is the Mossberg 500A Gold Reserve home defense and field combo. 

I would really like to trade these items(more on that below), but will sell if the right offer comes along. I dont really know what to ask money wise for these items. Make me an offer. Im willing to deal, but like I said I would prefer to trade. 

I am located in Oak Island and will travel a reasonable distance to meet you in Brunswick County and New Hanover County. Would prefer face to face but if you want me to ship this stuff I can for what ever it cost me to ship it. Keep in mind the barrel is heavy and akward, but again I would ship for the right trade.

Email me and I will respond immediatly and Im sure we can get a deal going that will be profitable for both of us. Thanks guys!"

The two things you have to switch is the barrel and the BCG. The 6.5 Grendel round is a accurate and a great round to shoot. The only thing is the 6.5 Grendel round is a hair bigger then the 223.

This rifle is sighted in at 100 yards and is surprisingly accurate. I went through 200 rounds of TulAmmo 7.63x39 last weekend and didn't have one fte or ftf. Looking at other sites online, I know that if I just sold the magazines I'd be looking at a little over $300 for the 5 of them. But that takes time and energy. At a gun show last Saturday a guy had these same tapco mags but they were black and he wanted $74.99 a piece. Let me know if there is something that you want to trade but honestly cash would be best for me right now.

The wood has normal handling marks and wear but no cracks. The residue on the right ride of the receiver is left over from someone leaving a sticker on it for sometime. The bore is very dirty and does look to have some rust and pitting. This has no reserve and will go to highest bidder. Will make a great addition to any collection and could be redone back to new.

This is one of the nicest and best quality ARs you can buy. And to get a new, unfired one is very rare. You get to break it in properly and have a weapon you know you can count on because nobody else has ever used it! And it's new in the box so no matter what assault weapons ban comes, this is a true pre-ban original!!

This is the original AR platform - the CAR 15
Here is the full info:

Here is a link to one that sold recently with the long barrel which is much more common:

http://www.gunsamerica.com/921536447/Olympic_CAR_15_pre_ban_Pristine_condition.htm

This is a brand new, never fired classic. When these were being made in the late 80's they were by far one of the best quality AR on the market. They are not made to this quality nowadays. Ive decided there are some other toys I want more than this one so Im selling it. Its been stored now for over 20 years! 
The serial number is V followed by 4 digits. You can confirm the manufacture date on Oly Arms website ""What does my serial number mean"" webpage. 

This has the impossible to find 11.5 barrel with 5.5 permanently attached supressor making it meet the 16"" barrel length requirement. This is an extremely rare rifle!

This has the highly desired SS 1 in 7"" barrel like our soldiers use and chromed bore and chamber for optimum performance and durability. It still all stock with the original box and accessories. 



Im taking cash and trade offers. 
From my research these seem to start at about 2K for a pre-ban 80's model, never fired. And it's almost impossible to find one with the 11.5"" barrel. I'm not looking to get every last dollar on this but I'd take the lower end of what these appear to be bringing. 

I also have about AR mags and I can include as many as you want for the right price. See my other listings. 

Im located basically on the DE/PA/MD border. I prefer FTF sale but can do shipping to FFL.

I have sold several rifles from me personal colection and can email you the previous listings and contact info for the buyers who I have shipped to. 
Beware of the really low prices - if its too good to be true, it probably is.

My terms are I will travel halfway to you or all the way if your not too far. (I hope to find my wish list within 100 miles) I will pay cash, and If you price is close to what I think your rifle is worth I'll make a counter offer. If you email me come crazy blue sky price I'm not likely to write back. I have a Washington State CWP, you can see it. you can see my Drivers licence, and if you really feel like it's necessary I will fill out a bill of sale. 
Were is my wish list:
A Remington 7400/742 in 30.06 in ""good"" condition. Nicks in the stock, blemishes are just fine, these rifles are going to be used, not put in some safe to await the end of the world. 
a Bolt Action 30.06 in ""truck Gun"" Condition.(why can't cars have guns?)  My prefrence would be an old sporterized Springfield 1903 or Enfield 1917 but and functional but cosmetically challenged 30.06 will get a look. 
Something bolt action Left Handed. My son is a lefty and I know he would love anything where he didn't have to reach over the top of the rifle to work the action.
A carbine in .44 magnum, a Ruger Deerfield, 77/44 or anything lever action, in ""good"" condition. 
A lever action 30.30 in ""Truck Gun"" Condition Marlin, Winchester... I'm not picky. 
I'm not concerned with optics on any of these rifles, if you like the scope, but don't like the rifle that's fine.

All of these magazines are 30 round capacity and all are in excellent condition. Chinese AK magazines are extremely difficult to find and are no longer imported into the United States. These are only going to get harder and harder to find, especially with the magazine market drying up the way it has. These are all smooth back magazines, so there is no spine digging into your hand when you change mags or when shooting. These magazines are the best of the best and are considered to be top of the line in terms of magazines. These are not stamped made in China on the floor plate. If you are looking for high quality AK magazines then look no further. I prefer a face to face sale but I will ship these if necessary but the buyer will pay the shipping costs. With the pending legislation, we may no longer be able to purchase these mags in the coming months. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via email. Thanks for looking."

Here we have my KelTec PLR16 .223 . This is classified as a pistol, but dont let that fool you. I got it in next to new barely used condition last summer, and Ive probably put 2-3 boxes through it . I added the rail, muzzle break,BSA scope, laser, and flashlight all new last summer. It comes with the stock 10 shot clip, and 3-30 shot clips and about 100 rounds of ammo. Scope has a twist dust cover front and back. This gun has extremely high reviews, and is near impossible to find (please feel free to google it). Kel Tec cant even keep up with orders years BEFORE the threat of the new bans. Its design broke the mold in the .223 market. If you like ""bump shooting"" this is the one for you.

Will only consider a partial trade involving one revolver of high caliber, in nickel or chrome with a 6"" or better barrell. Im not desperate or broke so dont bother with bad offers.I will deal with only 21+year olds with I.D. No felons, as I will do an on the spot check if I feel its neccessary through the Wisconsin public online court records. Im sorry but thats how it is . I will not aid in the illegal sale of firearms to a felon. Im not a dealer, and this will be a private sale. Will not ship, must be picked up in person. Serious parties only, and please include phone number with email."

This ammunition is top quality M80 ammo. Please note that it has the NATO headstamp. That is a exclusive club that means that the arsenal has passed some tough tests and the ammo is good to go. This ammo has ""staked"" primers that have the advantage of a crimped primer, but are much easier to reload. This ammo is boxer non-corrosive primed and EXTREMEMLY clean when fired. Our tests show this ammo to be extremely accurate and function perfectly in semi and full auto military rifles. AND IT HAS A COPPER JACKETED BULLET. NO STEEL ANYWHERE IN THIS AMMO.

All of these magazines are brand new and are sealed in the wrapper. These magazines are manufactured by Okay Industries. Okay Industries are one of the top tier manufacturers of AR-15 magazines. All 35 are brand new and have never been removed from the packaging. You will not find a better AR magazine. I am asking $25 per magazine. I will ship these magazines at the buyer's expense. I will take paypal plus 3%, paypal gift option, or USPS money order if shipping has to be arranged. I prefer to meet face to face but I will ship these. I will consider trades for firearms or possibly steel AK magazines. But those would be the only trades I would consider. These magazines will likely go quickly. We may not be able to purchase these in the coming months so the time to buy is now. I started out with over 300 of these and they have went quickly. I have made many face to face transactions but I have shipped them nationwide as well. Many dealers are selling these for $40. I will sell all 35 of them for $700, which is an absolute steal. Thanks for looking."

These are top quality magazines and all work perfectly. Most magazines have not been used or used very little. They all work perfectly! I started out with over 200 of these magazines and I am down to only ten left! Thanks for looking.
