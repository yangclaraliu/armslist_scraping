The grips are two sets of different shades of purple from tombstonegrips.com, as well as the original factory black grips.

The pistol is new in the box and has never been fired, includes all original paperwork to include a warranty registration card.

Basically, I bought the gun and the grips thinking the wife would enjoy it, and she ended up thinking it was pretty but that the bullets looked big and intimidating and the pistol itself (18 oz) was too heavy.  She's Japanese and has never been exposed to firearms before so I bought her a pocket .22LR now and I'm selling this because I don't have a need for it at the moment and it's just collecting dust.  If she ever decides to step up in caliber in the future then perhaps I'll get another one but I don't feel like hanging on to it until/if that happens.

For those of you wondering, the pistol itself retails for $350+tax.  The grips retail for $50 each.  You are getting a brand new gun without having to pay me your sales tax with $100 grips free - warranty card and everything.

I will sell the pistol face to face but you must have a purchase permit or concealed pistol license.

If you are from out of state I will sell it to you as well, but there will be an extra fee of $100 for shipping and paperwork required.  I can only have it sent to an FFL in your state, you will need to pick it up and do paperwork with them."

Now, the ammo is rivaling or exceeding costs of my big rifle ammo. 

It is a DPMS A-15 with a quadrail and covers, vertical foregrip mounted where it should be, not right in front of the magwell. If you are going to mount one there, just use the magwell as your grip. It has a Sig Sauer prismatic 3x scope with illuminated bullet drop reticle. Hogue rubberized grip, 2 30 rd mags and 4 5 round mags. Only ammo that goes with the gun is 18 rounds of Winchester Razorback XP. Its a really nice hunting load that was designed to take down wild boar with one shot, so it will take a deer down aswell.

Details:

The Daniel Defense Offset Flashlight Mount is designed for use in conjunction with a vertical foregrip which is mounted on the bottom rail. The Offset Flashlight Mount may then be mounted on either side rail for ambidextrous use. It is designed so that as the shooters forward hand grips the vertical foregrip, his thumb has quick and perfect access to the rear button of his flashlight.
This setup eliminates many accidental light discharges because although the action to the on/off button is quick and natural, it is also deliberate. This model attaches utilizing a Socket Head Cap screw.

PMR-30 The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). WOULD ACCEPT TRADE FOR NIB KSG! The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Kimber Solo CDP 9mm
2-Tone w/ Laser Grip

Brand New! NO credit card fees!!


The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.

With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.

From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, Melonite® coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

Unmolested but ready to be bubba-ized , tacti-cooled, or just shoot the heck out of it like it was designed for. Has the grenade launcher still attached as well as the bayonet. NO, I have NO grenades to include with this gun, let alone anything for you to stick the bayonet into, LOL . 100 Rounds of Ammo and a 30 round mag and an extra OE mag included. That will get you started on your 922r compliant conversion for the ultimate tactical SKS . Bore is great and the gun shows a lot of character. It even has a Yugoslavian soldiers name carved into the stock. I wonder if Tito had him beheaded for destruction of state property? Maybe he was just court martialed for grafitti, lol.  I have some stripper clips for it as well as any other SkS Item I can dig up.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters."
