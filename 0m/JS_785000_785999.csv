I have a Colt MKIV Ser 70 5"" Gov't w/2mags + Orig Box/manual in Excellent Condition, still has polished bluing (a few slide wear marks and very slight scratches 1/8-1/16"" towards the end, mainly just handling marks) and the great Series 70 Trigger.

If I don't sell this by next month, I will just take it down and keep it so I am not in a 'need' to sell it, so no texts at 2 in the morning asking if I will take $300 okay? I am not really looking for a trade on this one, unless it is drastically in my favor. I will consider all fair offers and if you have any questions feel free to ask. I picked this up used so I do not know the round count, but it doesn't appear to have had much use and it also looks to be stock.

Here's a description from H&K website. 
""The mr556a1
A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.

The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. 

This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. 

The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. 

The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. 

The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. 

Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life.

But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. 

Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. 

The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy. 

A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. 

Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition.

Using a 7.62x39 round ammo is easer to find.  This is a never fired factory new one. You will not find these on your dealers shelves, or any shelves any longer. These may be last of the mini 30’s as rumor has if Ruger will stop manufacturing of the 30, don’t even consider everything else going on.  Comes with Ruger factory 5 and factory 20 round magazines. Don’t ponder if you are looking for a new mini 30.

BUY NOW WHILE YOU CAN, following legislation being introduced into congress NOW


    H.R. 138 would ban transfer or possession of standard capacity magazines, targeting those that hold more than 10 rounds.

    H.R. 141 would impose federal regulation of gun shows. This legislation would require background checks on all gun sales at guns shows, and impose addition federal regulations on these traditional local events.

    H.R. 142 would ban Internet or mail order ammunition purchases, require a federal license for all ammunition sellers and mandate reporting of “bulk” ammo purchases. The record keeping and licensing requirements included here will place a serious burden on buyers and sellers and vastly increase the cost of ammunition—which is why the previous federal recordkeeping requirements were repealed in the 1980s.
McCarthy also introduced H.R. 137, which according to press reports would create a national database of people “prohibited” from buying a firearm. Since the National Instant Criminal Background Check System is already supposed to be just such a database, the purpose of the legislation is currently unclear."

I purchased it new almost two years ago and it has had exactly 1,025 flawless rounds through it (25 JHP, 50 230gr FMJ, and 950 200 lead target loads). Basically, it has been fired enough to be broken in and that's all. Crisp, tight and bright!

The 5"" long Government Model is the best single stack duty, defense or competition pistol you'll find in America -- the best quality, the best value and the best performance. No wonder so many of them show up at IPSC Limited Class matches. The Premier II© is even guaranteed to shoot 3"" groups at 50 yards!

The gun has functioned perfectly and is the best 9mm I have ever owned. almost no recoil.
Gun makes weight for IDPA with the 10 round mags. (39oz) The polygonal rifling in the barrel is very easy to clean.
I had the gun polished on the sides to give it a two tone finnish, Looks Great and gets alot of attention. Also had the infinity symbol engraved on the side of the slide. If your looking for a excellent stainless 9 mm or are thinking about getting into some competitions this is a great start.


The mods are as follow...

Wilson Combat 9lb recoil spring (also comes with a 11lb and 16lb spring)
Wilson Combat firing pin spring
Wilson Combat Hammer spring
CZ customs trigger spring Kit (Very good trigger)
Polished feed ramp 

Comes with 6 mags

The class covers CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Self Defense, and Interaction with Law Enforcement. 

There is a written exam along with a shooting test. You don't need to worry about either test as I give you everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour course. 

I have no minimums on my classes and will NOT cancel them because I don't have enough people for the class. One person is all it takes.

You can bring your own pistol for the shooting portion along with 50 rounds of ammunition. I recommend using a .22 however any caliber is accepted. If you don't have a pistol yet or would just like to borrow mine I have a .22 Ruger.

This gun has never had a bullet in it.  I purchased this gun last year, and then lost interest in AR’s.   When I bought it from the dealer, I talked him into throwing in a lockable case, so I didn’t get the original cardboard box.  I do have all the manuals and the lifetime warranty card, which was never sent in.  I don’t know much about ArmaLite firearms, but since many police departments, and the military uses them I’d gamble to say this is a pretty good gun.  It seems to also have very good reviews on the web.  You can also go to Youtube and see one in action. We have local dealers that are selling AR’s here for as much as $2800, so I’ve priced mine at $1650.  The pickins are gettin slim, and a ban is clearly in the future, so I expect this gun will sell pretty quick.  I am not a dealer.  Face to face deal.  I will not ship.  I will only accept cash/no checks of any kind, and no trades.  This firearm is in Yakima.  I will appropriatly edit or delete this ad when the gun is sold."

I never fired the gun. The gun is as new. I want $1775 for it. I am selling off some weapons to do something different. please call REDACTED if interested. Permit or concealed carry required.
