This gun has never been fired, finish is very good, comes with all original paperwork.  It is just a little over 14 inches in length, and comes with original 30 round clip

 The Spectre is an Italian submachine gun that was produced by the SITES factory in Turin. It was designed by Roberto Teppa and Claudio Gritti in the mid-1980s. Production in Italy ceased in the year 1997, with the closure of SITES, but proceeded in very small numbers in Switzerland through Greco Sport S.A., a company founded by one of the designers of the Spectre, Claudio Gritti, until 2001. During the mid 80’s and early 90’s, a limited number made its way to the states via imported by American Arms Inc. The Spectre is used by the Swiss armed forces and by Italian armed forces, and has been exported elsewhere.

The Spectre is a standard blowback firearm operating from a closed bolt; however it has some unusual features. The barrel shroud completely hides the barrel. The bolt is designed to pump air through the barrel shroud to provide additional cooling. The Spectre is hammer-fired and the trigger group is double action with a decocker. This allows the shooter to safely carry a round in the chamber and fire immediately. As this eliminates the need for cocking prior to shooting no manual safety is provided. Unconventional 30-round capacity, four-column magazine is provided with the Spectre, but it can also use conventional magazines."

It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.  Includes pocket/belt clip.

It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety."

If you are looking on here on any of your other favorite websites for the "" The deal of a lifetime"" then I should probably tell you that theres a great chance you aren't going to find it here.  I know it sounds like common sense to some of us but if a deal sounds too good to be true then it generally is. Unfortunately there are scumbags, people who don't have the right to call themselves real men, that must make a living by stealing from others! So if that great deal comes along that's not the state you're in then run away! You have to ask yourself that if it's such a great deal then why can a person not sell it in their own state? I will guarantee you that they will offer to pay for shipping if it helps you out. So if you find yourself getting ready to send a check to someone you've never met then stop and think what you're doing. You would be much better off giving the money to charity and sending it to a good cause. hopefully no 1  hopefully no 1 learned anything new from this."

it is numbers matching and the wood is dark mahogany, i thought about refinishing

the wood, but i just could not remove the patina and its history off of it.

i also have a 1907 pattern bayonet that i would sell with it. the bayonet fits the rifle
but is an earlier enfield bayonet i would take 80.00 for it

both rifle and bayonet would be 380.00

I used all the best weapon components when I built this bad boy. The rifle is a Colt Carbine M4 Law Enforcement 6920, 16"" barrel with a complete Magpul MOE furniture kit all the way around.  I also installed 3 full legnth Moe Picatinny rails on the top and sides of the handguard and a half rail on the underside before the foregrip where the Blackhawk 2-Position Bi-Pod is installed.  On the left rail there is a Viridian C5L Green Laser LED combo here are the specs, this little thing blew me away:

On the right side rail I have a Powertac Warrior w/Cree XM-L LED, this light is the brightest LED flashlight I've ever seen! here are the specs:

Mounted on top of the rifle is a Burris AR-536 Prism Weapon Sight, this is a fixed power 5X scope with both green and red reticles in 5 powers, here are the specs:
Accurate Close-Quarters Sight Plus Bullet Drop Compensation To 600 Yards


Multi-purpose tactical prism scope with 3x or 5x magnification provides precise targeting from zero to 500 (3x) and 600 (5x) yards. Fully coated optics minimize glare, and Ballistic/CQ™ illuminated reticle enhances target acquisition in low-light conditions. Bracketed cross hairs subtend 18"" at 100 yards, with additional dots to provide immediate elevation adjustment from 100 to 500/600 yards. Control knob provides five reticle brightness levels in red or green; reticle appears black in the off position. Removable accessory rails on the top and sides allow mounting of open sights, red dot sights, lasers, or other accessories. Fully-machined aluminum body is hardcoat anodized for extra surface strength, with a non-reflective, matte black finish. Integral mount clamps securely to MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail, and also allows easy installation on AR-15/M16 carry-handle receivers. Flip-up lens cap/sunshades included.

Then on top of the Picatinny rails on the Burris AR-536 is an EOTech XPS 2-0 Holographic Weapon Sight, here are the specs for that:
•Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length.
•Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 of rail space compared to the 4"" N battery sights.
•Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap. Better sealing is achieved.
•Battery compartment is now separated from the base to allow it to hover over delta ring of rife.
•Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 500-600 hours, tripling the battery life of the N sights.
•0- 65MOA ring with 1 MOA aiming dot., 1- Single 1MOA aiming dot, 2- 65MOA ring with (2) 1 MOA aiming dots.

This weapon package has it all! Sale also includes all boxes, papers, two Magpul 30 round clips, warranty and Bulldog floating gun carry bag with 4 Mag holder pouches and zip pouch."

  Please remember that I did not cause the prices to go so high and I will not be able to get another one either.

With a little research you will find this is the best factory produced semi-auto shotgun on the market, for deer and small game.

Saddle mounts are available for $40 to scope the gun if desired. And I personally chose the nicer polished stock because it retains a higher value and can always be wrapped with non stick camo for field use."

This is a collectible Beretta 92F 9MM FBI National Academy Graduate Model. Graduates were offered an opportunity to purchase these Beretta 92F which has gold inlay, and FBINA seals imbedded in the grips. It is in an Oak case with a glass presentation lid with, embedded, etched seal in the glass. Case has a lock and key. This gun has never been fired. This belonged to a friend that graduated and later sold it to me. It has been sitting in my safe for the last several years and I have decided to sell to put it in the hands of a serious collector. I also have the original cardboard Beretta box that it was shipped in. The later issue ones did not include the wood case and was replaced with the standard plastic case. These are very rare but do show up from time to time. Additional pictures can be supplied upon request. What may appear to be wear on the magazine shown is light reflection. $1895.00 cash face to face sale. I feel that the price is fair considering one sold on one of the auction sites for $2200.00

Those serial # were 534000/599000.
After the 8 September 1943 armistice between Italy and the Allies, the Germans saddled Beretta with three engineers from Germany. Moreover the factory was garrisoned by the waffen ss!!! 'armed security service' Weapons of that time, even the ones produced for the Germans, bore the punch mark 4UT, (Quarto Ufficio tecnico di Controllo Armi e Munizioni--4th Technnical Control Unit...
-an C. Still, in Axis Pistols, page 107, states,
""It is likely that almost all of the 4/UT, ...were used by the German Army"". He also includes two other variations in this statement, ""1944 dated and blank slide Model 1935"".
Ugo Menchini, in Pietro Beretta Le Automatiche, regarding an M1934, page 255, states,
""In late 1940 there appears an oval including the punch mark IVU. It refers to the 4th technical Control Unit of the FAG, where inspection was carried out.""
Note that, while they seem to represent the same inspectors, the ""IVU"" is not the same mark as the ""4UT"". The IVU would be found on the pre RSI model M1934, and the 4UT would be found on the RSI model M1935.
These are the reasons why I believe that it is likely that all of the 4UT Berettas WERE RSI pistols!! the IVU and the 4UT were the same office, but under Italian management -the IVU, before the surrender of Italy, and German the 4UT, so after september, 8 1943.........

Mussolini was rescued by German paratroopers led by Otto Skorzeny. He was then installed by the Germans as the President of the Italian Social Republic (RSI). The RSI was to be an Italian regime which was to nominally administer the German-occupied northern Italy. As the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale (MVSN, also known as ""Black Shirts"") was disbanded by the terms of the armistice, the Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana was formed on 24 November 1943. The ""Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana"" was formed out of local police, ex-army, and others still loyal to the fascist cause. 

Pistol is in near unissued condition with mirror bore , mint! no rust, scuffs, dings,tight action. no import markings! BRINGBACK???? a prime example of strain on axis weapons fabrication late in the war, with tooling and machinery marks throughout, it comes with one extra original period magazine!!!!!!!!

Take a ride on the GSX-R600 and you'll quickly become aware of a highly developed sporting tool. On a particular solo run on the Gixxer, the man/machine interface was direct and inspirational, not wanting of a dollop more power or a scintilla of a quicker flick. Its available power is plentiful and the gearbox and slipper clutch works seamlessly at the command of your fingers and toes. The twisty road ahead is consumed to the accompaniment of a beautiful scream from the injected Four. It's difficult to imagine an experience much better.

It was a DCM rifle that appears to have never been issued then locked in a reserve center or home guard unit armory throughout WWII until making it’s way to the DCM, and then my hands 20 odd years ago.  I only fired 10-rounds through it soon after getting it, and was going to pass it along to my son, grown now, who has shown ZERO interest in it or firearms.  

The metal retains all the original finish but for some very minor wear between the forward barrel band and front sight where it was removed and replaced in an unpadded gun rack for periodic inventory before being sent to Anniston Army Depot from the home guard outfit where it sat throughout WWII.   PLEASE NOTE:  I am reasonably assuming this was the rifle’s origins because of the complete lack of any wear and a good general knowledge of military history and procedures.

The bore looks perfect and is bright and shiny. I do not have a bore gauge but do recall at the time I got it, all DCM rifles were properly checked by an armorer before going out.  As I said, I put 10-rounds through it right after getting the rifle achieved approximately 1.5 MOA accuracy with some old standard ball surplus ammo.  

The walnut stock and hand guard are in all but factory new condition.  The stock has the initials ""RA"" stamped into it on the left-hand side center along with “FJA” ink stamped just under the safety on the same side .

All of the metal parts that I can see that should be marked are marked with a small ""R"" indicating Remington manufacture.  The barrel is armory proof marked/dated ""2-1942"", which is consistent with the rifle’s serial number range thus further evidence it is ALL original and matching parts since manufactured.

The only non original piece is that I have put a high quality leather sling on it since the rifle did not come with the original issue web sling of it's era. 

NOTE:  IF YOU CANNOT MAKE ARRAIGNMENTS TO MEET ME PERSONALLY AND BUY THIS RIFLE, IT MUST BE SHIPPED BETWEEN LICENSED FFL DEALERS AT ALL COST OF SAID BEING THAT OF THE BUYER.    That said, I prefer to deal in person anyway, but don't mind meeting someone at a local gun shop f you'd like the gunsmith's opinion of it before buying.  

I have not ""tested"" this firearm in any way and so the purchaser is responsible for having it checked over by a competent gunsmith before any attempt is made to use or fire this firearm. I make no warranty for this firearm's safety or function but have done my best to describe it to the best of my knowledge in the write up. I am not a gunsmith and so I can only give a very general description. The purchaser is buying the gun in ""AS IS"" condition.

These will be the main target of the ban and I am afraid an executive order will come in just a couple weeks terminating all the backorders.

 Please remember that I did not cause the prices to go so high and I will not be able to get another one either. An Illinois Armslist seller is asking $2000.00 for these and if I wait two weeks this will probably be worth much more.

If you know AK 47s you realize this is one of the most highly desired versions. They are milled from a solid block of steel instead of stamped sheetmetal and were the frames used to create the strongest full auto versions. This one has been in storage for  more than 20 years and is now ready to exercise first amendment rights. I had two of these left and have painfully decided to let one go. Although this is unfired it has some scratches in the receiver near the safety that were there when I bought it. They are shown in the pictures and in no way affect the function. It appears that someone had two rifles together in a box and they rubbed together in shipping, the rest of this gun is perfect There are few of these left in the country and sell quickly even in a normal market. There is a 30 round mag included.
