Manufacturer Stag Arms, www.stagarms.com, REDACTED
Type AR-style semiauto
Caliber 5.56mm NATO/.223 Rem.
Barrel 24 in., stainless match grade, 1:8 twist
Length 42.25 in.
Weight 9lb., 11 oz.
Stock A2, Hogue grip; free-float aluminum handguard
Gas Block low-profile
Finish mil-spec anodized
Trigger two-stage match, 3lb., 3 oz.
Sights none

Also included with the rifle are the original Stag Arms case and a Plano Protector two rifle case with three matching padlocks. Everything you see in the photos is included; original 10rd magazine, bipod, sling, scope rail and rings, Bushnell 3-9x38 scope, chamber flag and cleaning kit. I also have 20rds of Black Hills 75gr match ammo and about 100rds of Tula steel case for plinking. The scope is adequate for 100 yard work and since the rifle doesn't have steel sights I'm including it but you might want to bolt on something better if you plan on going longer range.

I can't stand having to sell this rifle, I've only had it for about four months but I need to finance a divorce so selling it solves two problems. It gets me cash to pay the lawyer and it assures she won't get the rifle in the settlement :-)

I prefer a FTF sale within 40-50 miles of Lansdale, PA. You'll need to provide a PA state issued ID to prove your residency at the time of sale. MSRP is a hair over $1,000 for the naked rifle. I'm asking $850 for the whole setup. I take cash or other secured payment (i.e. money order).

If you have any questions at all, email me and I'll give you my phone number."

This rifle has 1100 in it, and the parts are worth more than that. So something of comparable value please. I will downtrade if you throw a little cash on it. I will cut a deal though, I am not looking to get an exact match in value.

I will also take 950 cash, if interested in buying it outright. 

Components are as follows:
BCM upper, w/t marks and M4 feed ramps, 20'' chrome lined 1:7 twist barrel, Magpul BUIS, chrome bolt carrier group, BCM gunfighters charging handle, Knights Armament RAS handguard, DSA(DS arms) ZM4 lower, 5 position telescoping Vltor stock, and Magpul MOE pisol grip.
Rifle is UNFIRED, NEW. The RAS handguard is the only used part.

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

Features:
•Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
•Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life 
•Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes 
•Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
•Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves 
•One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
•Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories 
•Ambidextrous magazine release lever
•Extended slide release 
•Patented Lock-Out Safety device

Variant 1:? Double action/single action with ""SAFE” position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame."

I will give ya the load data i have worked up for it along with 50 plus rds of ammo loaded for this rifle. has rings and bases on it as well and is ready for a scope. 400.00 cash I have shot under 1 inch MOA at 100 yrds with the rifle. Its a shooter. Bluing is in excellent condition it has the nice deep gloss bluing not the crap that a lot of manufacturers call bluing now a days. I was hopeing i could go elk hunting one of these days but dont see that coming around for awhile. With the recoil pad and the break rifle is very manageable to shoot. The break really reduces the recoil by a lot. and the pad reduces it even more. This is a solid hunting rifle Scope in picture is not included in the price but can be left on for another 250.00 its a leupold vx-11 3-9x50 like new only had about 25 rds shot under it.

the total cost of the rifle with all of the upgrades is $2,167.00. I am not going to include the M68 that's on there because I want to save it for another gun. I'm willing to let this baby go for 1,600.00 first come first serve. I promise you won't come across this quality of rifle at this price anywhere else. Cash only, buyer must be at least 18 and willing to sign a bill of sale.

I'm going to throw in 2 optics, 1 NCStar magnified red/green sight ($100.00) and a Bushnell re/green T-dot sight ($199.99) without adding anything to the cost of the gun (still asking $1600) The third picture has everything that comes with the rifle."

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

Features:
•Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
•Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life 
•Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes 
•Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
•Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves 
•One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
•Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories 
•Ambidextrous magazine release lever
•Extended slide release 
•Patented Lock-Out Safety device

Variant 1:? Double action/single action with ""SAFE” position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame."

Excellent quality weapon used by the police and military for years. Equivalent to the U.S. made Smith and Wesson, this Hungarian pistol is very nice.

Here is a short history:

FEG Arms Factory of Hungary started producing Walther PP/PPK clones in the late 1940s starting with their Model 48 which differed from the Walther PP only in minor details. By the late 1950s FEG began making broader changes resulting in the PA-63, which uses a 9x18mm Makarov round. It quickly became standard issue to both Hungarian military and police forces. Due to its popularity and relative durability FEG later issued models using .32ACP and .380 ACP caliber rounds (FEG AP9 and PMK-380 respectively).

""The Military standard PA-63 version sports a two-tone polished aluminium frame with black slide, grips, trigger and hammer assembly. While unusual for military issue in that a reflective polish was used, it was chosen due to its relative cheapness as well as quicker build time. Problems related to the durability of the aluminium frame were resolved prior to the development of the PA-63 in 1961 with the production of the FEG R-61 Police Pistol. The addition of .1% titanium to the aluminium alloy solved premature alloy frame wear problems inherent in the earlier FEG aluminium framed pistols. This development was then applied to all aluminium framed FEG guns including the PA-63.""

I have added a set of Marschall grips and include the original grips plus another unused magazine.
The gun has had one magazine full shot through it and has been in my glove box since then.

I have an Alessi holster I will be listing that fits this gun as well as the Walther PP and other similar guns. Face to face sale only on firearm sale. No felons, need Tennessee drivers license for proof of residency.

I am selling a Century Arms International GP1975 AK-47 chambered in 7.62x39.  This rifle is built on a NDS receiver (US made) with Romanian surplus parts and a new Green Mountain barrel (US made).  The barrel is mirror bright and only has approximately 200 rounds through it.  The barrel is threaded and currently has a slant brake on it, but you can swap out whatever you want (standard threading of 14 x 1 LH). FCG is TAPCO G2.

This model is a step up from the WASR10/63 as it features magwell dimples to reduce mag wobble and doesn’t have issues with canted front sights and roughly made wood furniture.  This is an accurate and well running AK, just not what I’m looking for. 

Selling for $425 with 8 magazines (4 Euro steel mags, 2 TAPCO mags, and 2 Master Molder mags) or $400 without magazines. I can do FTF in Wisconsin or $15 shipping to your FFL. I accept “discreet” online payment with 4% added or USPS MO (as well as cash for FTF deals). I will also entertain OBO offers.

This is also posted on some forums, so first ""I'll take it"" gets it. I will honor timestamps on responses for priority.

This rifle is absolutely spotless with 20 rounds through it. It was cleaned after it's one trip to the range to zero a scope that was taken off to be put on a different 22-250. It has a 1 in 12 twist. Stainless fluted barrel and a wood laminate stock that has no gouges or knicks in it anywhere. It does have mounts on it. It also has the accu-trigger. I own 6 savage rifles and they all have the accu-trigger. This is an amazing asset to have on any rifle. The truth about this gun is that it is too nice for me to take it out slamming all over for coyotes and whistle pigs. I also have 40 rounds of ammo for it. Check out Savage's web site for the retail price if you like and once you see the asking price here you will see how this is a steal. As far as trades I am looking for a Smith and Wesson M&P full size in 9mm. We can work out details as far as trade value and cash to even up. That is my number 1 trade as of right now. I will entertain any offers due to the fact a person can never have enough guns so shoot me something and we will see what we come up with. All I can do is say no. Thank you for looking.
