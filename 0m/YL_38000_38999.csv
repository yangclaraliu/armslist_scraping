Originally developed as a .40SW caliber service pistol with modular design, it was first announced in 1998 as the SIG Pro SP 2340. About one year later, the 9mm version, designated the SP 2009, was introduced and entered production. The SIG Pro is used by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), as well as by number of other law enforcement agencies worldwide. In the 2003, the French law enforcement agencies (including Gendarmerie and Police Nationale) adopted a slightly modified version of the SP 2009. New version of SIG Pro, designated as SP 2022,  is to replace Beretta 92G and some older pistols. Total of 250 000 SP 2022 pistols are ordered by France. 

The SIG Pro is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It uses a fairy traditional browning cam-operated locking system. Barrel locks into the slide via enlarged ejection port. The frame is made from polymer, with detachable grip panels. Grip panels can be easily replaced and are available in several different sizes and shapes. The modular hammer unit can be installed in traditional DA or DAO versions. There's no manual safety on all SIG Pro pistols. Instead, SIG Pro pistols are fitted with typical SIG-Sauer frame mounted decocker lever, and with automated firing pin safety. The overall design is slightly different from earlier SIG-Sauer pistols such as P220 or P226, as there is no separate disassembly lever on the frame of SIG Pro, and the slide release lever looks quite different. The SP 2340 and 2009 pistols are fitted with proprietary accessory rail under the barrel, while SP 2022 is fitted with integral Picatinny rail. SP 2022 also can be equipped with detachable silencer. Fixed sights are dovetailed into the slide."

Taurus 709 comes with all accessories included in the origional factory box and the Crossbreed Minituck which is an excellent IWB holster.  Holster spreads the load and causes next to no bulge.  I carry very comfortably in shorts and a t-shirt and it conceals well.  The little gun is small but very accurate.  Trigger takes a little getting used to but is extremely light and smooth.  This is as good a concealed carry setup as any I've had.  I hate to see it go but I'm broke:)

There are two M107 pin sets available; A 2 piece which takes care of the mid locking pin and rear locking pin and 3 piece pin set which includes the rear, mid and front bipod pin. It has a 29.5"" fluted heavy barrel which is not chrome lined, however it does have a chromed chamber. This weapon is an extremely good investment. If you're going to be shooting long range I would go with the standard M82A1 29"" barrel. If your application requires a shorter barrel I'd go with the CQ. It does have a flat bottom feet, however if you're going to be in the sandy terrain, I would recommend upgrading to the spiked bipod feet. When it comes to optics if you're going to be shooting every now and then I'd recommend a Leupold scope. If you're shooting over 1000 meters or in competition I'd recommend a NightForce scope. I would recommend a monopod and lock knob, it doesn't ship standard with the gun but It helps make the gun. The monopod helps keep the gun level so you don't have to hold it up. When placing your order please specify what shooting environment you'll be in, that way we can assist you in choosing a proper scope. They also make a set of M107 rails. One rail mounts on the bottom of the lower receiver in front of the bipod feet, perfect for optional light or adds extra protection the rifle if shooting from a concrete position. The 2nd rail mounts on the right hand side of the upper receiver allowing you to mount an IR laser.

You do not need to have an FFL to finish this gun, just finish it , serial #it, fill out the form, send in a 200 dollar check to the ATF and you have a nice carbine or pistol (depends how you build it)



this shoots the 7.62x25 round (1260 surplus rounds costs anywhere from 100-120)

It needs a trunion and a trunion plate and reciever finished to be shootable and complete. But unless you are a 07 AND 02 SOT holder you must convert it to semi auto or you will be in violation of the NFA.

To make semi auto all it needs is a FCG that has a disconnector, and a safety. A floating firing pin (right now it works off a closed bolt), slot the bolt and add a groove or pin in the ID of the reciever. You are done!

This is 40 S&W Federal Law Enforcement Classic Hi-Shok 180gr. Hollow Point Ammo. The Classic line of ammunition has served law enforcement officers for generations. It has proven itself as a consistent, dependable performer at a reasonable price. The Hi-Shok bullets hit hard and expand reliably for effective energy transfer. Typically this ammo is only available to law enforcement and military agencies through Federal, that is a Federal rule, not a law. We got this ammo, because we ordered it for a police department and they cancelled the order, so we can now sell it to anyone. This ammo is extremely hard for us to get and we have limited supplies. This ammo is packed in 50rd. law enforcement boxes, 1000rds. per case."

In addition to using only the best available components, MBI ammunition is assembled using some of the most modern electronic press equipment available. Because exceptional consistency is a major factor in creating accurate ammunition, a production facility that uses finely calibrated electronic press technology is key to ensuring that each shooter is well-pleased with the performance of their ammunition. 

Each brass cartridge casing used to produce MBI ammunition is processed by first undergoing a lengthy mechanical cleansing process. Once cleaned, each casing is then re-calibrated by an electronic press to ensure that the final dimensions of each round are within micrometer tolerances. Each casing is then re-primed and re-charged using high-quality primer and propellants. Once the new bullet is seated using a precision-tuned electronic press, each round is hand-inspected to ensure perfection. 

This product is not just remanufactured ammunition. It is ""precision"" remanufactured ammunition for the serious shooter. The fact that it costs less than most new ammunition is simply an added benefit.

I'm also aware of what they sell for locally.  I'm not trying to sell it on gunbroker, and whoever buys it will not have to pay shipping or a transfer fee like they would from gunbroker.  They'll get same day local pickup, ammo, and the chance to inspect the gun before they buy it, all things not available to them on gunbroker.  If those things aren't important to you, by all means, save a buck and buy it from someone you'll never meet in person.  After all, nobody's holding a gun to your head.  Considering those things, and the condition my gun is in, my asking price is fair.  I've sold many guns, and have a pretty good feel for the market, along with a working knowledge of gun value.  I've already got a potential buyer, he's just waiting on his paycheck.  That said, it's still first come, first served, and I have no doubt it'll be sold in the next couple of days.

I'm also aware of what they sell for locally.  I'm not trying to sell it on gunbroker, and whoever buys it will not have to pay shipping or a transfer fee like they would from gunbroker.  They'll get same day local pickup, ammo, and the chance to inspect the gun before they buy it, all things not available to them on gunbroker.  If those things aren't important to you, by all means, save a buck and buy it from someone you'll never meet in person.  After all, nobody's holding a gun to your head.  Considering those things, and the condition my gun is in, my asking price is fair.  I've sold many guns, and have a pretty good feel for the market, along with a working knowledge of gun value.  I've already got a potential buyer, he's just waiting on his paycheck.  That said, it's still first come, first served, and I have no doubt it'll be sold in the next couple of days.  Thanks for your input, but I'd appreciate it if you kept future communications to email, as is the civil way to handle something like this.  Taking jabs at me on the site and posting gunbroker ads that aren't yours isn't."

Excellent condition. Shot approx. 100 rds.  

From the makers of the popular GSG line of rifles and pistols comes the GSG-AK47 rifle. With a pistol grip, manual safety, and adjustable sights, this semi-automatic gun is sure to please.  The new GSG-5 offers a superb combination of handling and accuracy. Firing the .22LR round, taking the GSG-5 to the range is surprisingly inexpensive. Plus, because it shoots the .22LR, there is very little recoil, allowing for greater accuracy, even in rapid fire situations.

Perfect for plinking, varminting, or simple sport use, the GSG-5 provides the fun and excitement of H&K's MP-5 in an easy to shoot design. Even the most technical shooters will love training with this rifle, not to mention the money you'll save on ammo. 
With no scope, it can shoot 2-3"" with iron sights at 50-yards, it is probably accurate enough. However, I have bought a scope mount for it.  Also Has extra 25 rd. magagine included.
The MSRP on the wood stock model is $569.00

The new Walther PK 380 is the latest innovation from the world famous Walther Arms Company of Germany. 

The Walther PK380 is a scaled up version of the P22 which has gone over very well over the past few years.


The Walther PK 380 is designed with the light weight sleek design of any Walther firearm, but with concealed carry permit holders in mind, unlike many other similar style pistols the Walther PK380 is a single / double action pistol making it more accurate for long distance shooting.

Some of the features that make the Walther PK380 something worth mentioning would be the ambidextrous safeties, and factory adjustable sights. Also the 19.4 ounce design, making it light weight and sleek. The Walther PK380 comes with an accessory rail, as well as low cocking resistance slide, which have long been a complaint amongst new shooters and many women alike.

Whether it's dove loads in September or steel shot in November, the Stoeger P-350 will digest them all without so much as a hiccup. And there's even a 13 ounce recoil reducer that screws right onto the tail of the stock bolt to tame the kick of the heavy magnums. The P-350 fore-end assembly features twin action bars for smoother, non-binding cycling.
There are nine different models of the Stoeger P-350 to choose from-an 18-1/2 in. barreled home security model, the Max-4 HDT camo gun for waterfowlers, a Timber HD for turkeys, an APG HD for all around hunting, or the standard, all-purpose black synthetic. In addition, every P-350 field gun comes with five choke tubes, including an extra-full extended turkey choke, so no matter what your game, the Stoeger P-350 has you covered.

No other pump action shotgun comes close to the P-350 especially when consideringthe price, which comes in at a fraction of the cost of the other comparable shotguns. Whether you choose a camouflage version for waterfowl and turkey hunting, or a synthetic stocked field or home defense version, the P-350 offers the best value of any pump shotgun on the market today.

It has been in my families private collection for over 20 years! I am not in a hurry to sell, THIS IS A ONE TIME AUCTION!! The bolt action rifle is German, made by the Gustloff Arms Works in Suhl, probably in the 1930's, as a training rifle, hence its sights and other features resembling those of the Modell 98 military rifle. ""Kleinkaliber (KK) Wehrsportgewehr"" means ""Small bore (.22) Defense and Sport Rifle."" "".22 Lang fur Buchsen"" simply means "".22 Long Rifle."" The Gustloff factory was originally Simpson & Co., but the Simpsons were Jews and the Nazi government took over the factory and named it for Wilhelm Gustloff, the Swiss Nazi leader who had been assassinated. (A ship also named for him was sunk by the Russians late in WWII, with a loss of some 10,000 lives, the greatest marine loss in history.) SA d NSDAP stands for ""Sturmabteilung der National Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei"", which means it was owned by the so-called ""attack section"" of the NSDAP (Nazi) party. The SA, also known as ""storm troopers"" or ""Brownshirts"" was the part of the Nazi party originally charged with breaking up rallies of other parties and beating up anyone who opposed the Nazis in the period when the Nazis were seeking power through election."

995,http://www.armslist.com/posts/38995,"For Trade:  Magtech Model 199 Break barrel single 12g Shotgun, or 1991 CR125r Racing bike for handgun","county, St. Louis, Missouri",Offer,"Listed On: Sunday, June 20, 2010",Handguns,Walther,no type,no type,no type,"I have a pretty nice magtech model 199 single barrel shotgun for |||TRADE||| and possibly an older cr125r really fast bike that needs a little work to be perfect for Trade only. 

The shotgun shoots straight, is nice and tight since it was rarely fired, has soft case, is 12 gauge, chambers 2 3/4"" and 3"" rounds, comes with a new box of shells.

The cr125r Dirtbike is a bit larger than a regular 125 and can fly through jumps, it goes around 90mph, it was running really rough and smoking fierce when i got it but changed plug and put the proper gas/oil mix in and it runs pretty strong, could probably use small reed or jet put in but thats cheap and easy, oh and probably a back tire soon.  Usually starts first kick now. 

 Looking for a few decent handguns for 2 women.  May take just an average handgun for the Shotgun.  For the Dirtbike I am thinking something like a few small Sigs or decent Walther set with lasers, a few xd 40's, etc. Something quality, all offers considered for either the shotgun or bike including antique and rare things, silver and gold, gear, hard to find items, newer gen night vision, hunting equip, boat, etc. etc.
