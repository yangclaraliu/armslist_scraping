I am selling my Somewhat RARE Sig Sauer P226 40 caliber DAO pistol in excellent condition. Black Stainless slide on a OD green frame with rail. This is not a modified gun. Its a rare law enforcement DAO setup. It is DAO, but a very light DAO that only has one pull to get used to. Anti-snag hammer. No decocker because the pistol is never cocked even with a round in the chamber. This is the safest Sig carry gun if you think about it. The pics do NOT do this gun justice! Its in sweet shape and has been babied. Also it looks more green than it really is in the pics because i was too close with the flash. Its a darker OD green and looks great! It was made in the late 90s to early 2000's. I have added Trijicon 3 dot night sights with the cocking heel. Comes with two factory 2 Sig high cap flush fit mags, factory case, manual and an IMI retention holster with quick release. You get everything in the pics! She shoots like a dream and is crazy accurate!!! $760

This model has 4 ¼” barrels chambered in .45 Colt / .410 (both 3” and 2 ½”). 

As the first two images show, the barrels have some light surface scratching, so the exterior is at only perhaps 95%. The workings have been very well cared for: it has fired fewer than one hundred rounds, and has been dry-fired only twice (neither time by me). 

I purchased this derringer in order to explore some ideas for non-standard .410 shot. The tests were at standard pressure, but the projectiles slightly damaged the rifling of both barrels, as the third image shows. This damage does not at all affect the gun’s performance: these barrels are great for .410, but the short, shallow rifling at the muzzle (as well as the long freebore behind it) does not treat .45 Colt very well—and never did, right from the beginning. Bond Arms does sell barrels that are fully rifled and that chamber either .45 Colt or .45 ACP—4 ¼” by special order, 3 ½” from their website. Like all of their barrels, these will fit this frame. In good conscience, I can only recommend shotshells in any .45/.410 barrels, and this model shoots them very well (the extra barrel length both increases the velocity and decreases the felt recoil, so the Federal .410 handgun loads are quite adequate for self-defense).

The Snake Slayer IV is rarely in stock anywhere around here, so with shipping, sales tax and transfer fees, this gun with the extra grips cost me more than $650 earlier this year—and other than the cosmetic damage to the rifling, it is like new. $500 is a reasonable price and we need the money—I’ll throw in most of a box of 3” birdshot and half a box of 2 ½” Federal buckshot. Also, I’m willing to trade up and pay the difference, but the only gun I’m looking for is a Super Redhawk in .454."

Under that is a Norinco SKS. Chrome Barrel, threaded barrel, milled trigger group, all numbers matching ""00090"" looks brand new off the assembly line. Has bayonet and cleaning kit. Also has a paracord rifle sling. - 450.00

Next is a British Enfield 303 I believe is the MK4 No1 model. I have about 10 rounds for it, a hand full of clips and the sling with ammo pouches. Took it out a few weeks ago and it shot awesome! Tore it down and cleaned all the grease out of the rifle, very fun. - 350.00

Last is my 1895 Steyr M95.  Used in WWI and WWII buy Austria and Hungry. I have approximately 50 rounds for it. Super clean and numbers matching as well. - 300.00

I am looking for AR rifles, and not the 800.00 model Walmart sells. I posted beside the rifles the value of them, equaling out to about 1300.00. I am looking for a nice AR, but aftermarket furniture doesn't necessarily have to be there.

M96 Expeditionary Rifle

Review

The Robinson Armament M96 Expeditionary rifle broke onto the scene in late 1999 as the first new American designed ""assault rifle"" to be brought into production in many years. Tracing its heritage back to the Stoner M63, and sharing design traits with the AK, AR, and SIG 550 the M96 represents an interesting representation of various designs, in one well conceived package.

Although its heritage can be traced back to the the original Stoner 63, the only part that is common is the buttstock. The M96 utilizes a rotating multi-lug bolt (similar to an AR15 bolt), and a gas piston surrounded by a recoil spring, connected to the bolt to cycle the rifle (unlike the AR15, which uses direct gas pressure on the bolt carrier). The barrel assembly is a quick change design manufactured from 4140 steel that is 20"" in length with an integrated muzzle compensator, and a 1 in 9 twist rate. A two stage trigger is featured as standard, as well as 100 and 500 yard adjustable sights. The receiver is manufactured from Stainless Steel, utilzing a welded construction of the frame, upper handguard, and barrel mounting point. All of these features weigh in at 7.6 lbs in a 40"" package. 

Inspection of the M96 out of the box yielded a very tight and well built rifle. The takedown pins were tight, and unfortunately as they come from the factory, I find the protrusion from the right side of the receiver to be annoying - a simple workaround for this was to turn the pins around and feed them in from the right side of the receiver; much as the rear integrated takedown pin came from the factory - which minimized the extent to which those pins protrude. Doing the pin swap helped another problem, that of ergonomics and the magazine release - as the pin sits, it is terribly close to the magazine release and I found myself inadvertantly trying to press it more than once. Sights are adjustable for elevation and windage at the front and rear sights, unfortunately the front sight windage adjustment requires the use of a hex head key, which is not included with the rifle. On the positive side the safety is large, and allows for quick transitions from Safe to Fire. Ergonomics are good, with the rifle feeling a little muzzle heavy when compared to an AR15.


Initial firing of 200 rounds at the range was flawless. I utilized 55gr Winchester Ball and a variety of US military contractor magazines and one Thermold magazine. As suggested in the manual, I started firing with the gas port completely closed, but opened it up after a few rounds to half way through the settings to allow for the brass to be ejected approximately 7-10ft. The only problem at the end of the days firing was a loosening of the grip assembly, which was easily remedied (this was also exhibited on a second test gun that I fired). Much like the SIG 550 and FAL, the M96 bounces fired brass off the portion of receiver directly behind the ejection port; a series of small brass marks was visible at the end of the days firing. Felt recoil was less than that of a Colt SP1 that I fired for comparison, and was similar to a SIG 550. This reduced felt recoil can be attributed to an increased mass in the recripocating parts of the bolt and gas rod assembly, which helps reduce the amount of recoil energy that makes it to the shooters shoulder by disipating it to cycle the firearm.

Firing methodology consisted of firing 1 round every 5 seconds at a target 50 yards away; function firing was the primary concern, so not much concern was paid to accuracy. The group of 200 rounds did end up being about 1"" wide by 3"" tall; I attribute the vertical stringing to myself. Other shooters on the internet have noted accuracy with factory 55gr ammo in the range of 1.5"" at 100yds.

Overall impressions of this rifle are good. The proximity of the magazine well takedown pin to the magazine release did cause some problems with fumbling to release the mag, and the grip loosening is not something that is uncommon with a new firearm. Reliability was exceptional for a brand new semi automatic rifle, and the ergonomics are good. With the planned introduction of a carbine version, a bren style feeding mechanism for the beginning of 2000, and a beltfed conversion further down the road, the future of this weapon system looks bright - I would not hesitate in purchasing another one."

This is a Colt Single Action Army ""U.S. Cavalry"" revolver that was manufactured in 1882 for the United States military. This is a later ""DFC"" inspected gun with matching serial numbers. The barrel still measures the original 7-1/2"" in length and was never modified to ""Artillery"" length as so many were. Overall condition is good but little original finish remains. The revolver is mostly a silver/brown with some scattered areas of light pitting. The ""U.S."" marking and patent dates on the frame are all crisply marked as is the proper rollmarking along the top of the barrel. The grips are sound and original. They are ""D.F.C."" and ""P"" marked on the base and have the proper ""JEG"" (Capt. John E. Greer) cartouche which would be appropriate for guns in the 81,900 to 111,700 serial range. The mechanics are in good working order and the revolver functions well with some minor looseness. The bore rates about good to very good with strong rifling and only a few areas of pitting. The accompanying Kopec letter notes that some screws may be later replacements and the ejector spring is not original. The letter incorrectly states that the grips are non-original but closer examination has proved this not to be the case and they are correct for the gun. Probably the most iconic revolver associated with the Old West, the U.S. marked Single Action Army, particularly the Cavalry Model, is a highly prized collector's piece. An original gun, matching gun in any condition is a difficult item to locate. With the uncertain political climate and economic set-backs, this might be a good way to tuck away a little money for a rainier day. Buyer pays $30.00 shipping. This is an antique revolver and as such, no FFL is required in most areas and it can be shipped directly to the lucky buyer."

This is that kind of collectible firearm.  I am looking forard to this gun having more exposure than it would otherwise get in a private auction. In 1878, with its name firmly established in the rifle trade, Winchester decided that it was time to get into the shotgun market. With no in-house facilities to produce shotguns, Winchester contracted with English gunmakers to produce the very first shotguns to carry the Winchester name. Less than 1500 of these English doubles were produced. Of this number, only 3 guns are known to exist with gauges other than 12 or 10; one is a 16 gauge and two are 20 gauges. Prior to its discovery by the current owner, it was thought that Match Gun #1314 was the oldest/only English 20ga. double to exist. In his book, ""Winchester Shotguns and Shotshells,"" author Ronald Stadt features pictures of #1314, but specifically mentions #1312 at least three times. In the book, Stadt openly questions the existence of #1312 and perhaps what it was. 1312 is the oldest 20ga. shotgun to carry the company name. This shotgun is featured on p.7 of Dennis Adler's book, Winchester Shotguns. Full historical documentation in the form of a five-page handwritten letter from the late George Madis, foremost authority on Winchester firearms and author of ""The Winchester Book,"" ""The Winchester Model 12,"" and other definitive books, will be provided on the website dedicated to this gun. (see link) 1312's condition leaves quite a bit to be desired. It appears that someone attempted to refinish the stock. The wood as well as the checkering has been sanded and a coat of finish was applied. The original hammers have been replaced with others of the correct size. Thankfully, the metal was left untouched. There is pitting in the bores. Obviously the gun must never be fired, even with the proper ammunition. At this price, 1312 might be a good candidate for a restoration. This is a once in a lifetime chance for the collector to acquire a piece that is not only rare but historically significant. This gun has been in calendars and newspaper articles. This gun has allowed me to meet or correspond with authors and Winchester professionals that I would probably never have had the opportunity to meet. It's really been a lot of fun. A couple of years ago, I sent 1312 to Doug Turnbull Restorations for an examination. During a phone conversation, the restoration specialist told me that he was standing in a room full of some of the rarest Winchesters in existence, but 1312 was the only one that felt truly unique. He said that the others felt like variations of the same thing.  If you have any questions, feel free to email me. I will allow a five day inspection period with buyer paying all shipping charges.

Never refurbished, but the metal is in great shape. The front sight is the original flat bottom one piece from 39.

Non matching, as is standard for Finnish capture and reissue. Interestingly has a very early solid barrel band.

Bore is very good, trigger and chamber are the best I've seen in a m91/30.

Now if you are looking for a Mosin to use as a shooter, I have better bored shooters for less. This is really a collectable, as the SA marked captured rifles are hard to find.

As with all my mosins, I will include 20 rounds of ammo and one Russian stripper clip for easy loading.

Additional ammo, strippers, and accessories can be purchased with the rifle, just ask.

Does not have the original bayonet. I can provide replacements (new surplus) for $5 each with the rifle."

This rig was $5,520.95 new and used less than a dozen times, so for all intents and purposes, it's still like new. I then bought a used trailer that is near mint , add another $500.00 used for the trailer
RIB is rated for 4 people, 1100 pounds. It is made of hypalon, not cheap pvc, this thing is TOUGH !!!
I can haul it in my SUV, or trailer it, depends where I want to go that day. But hauling in the SUV makes you alot more mobile and able to launch anywhere you can drive to, no ramp needed.
This RIB does about 20 mph with my wife and I aboard, 23 mph by myself, and that’s legit from a GPS !!! 
 This is a “do anything, go anywhere” toy. Floats in about 5"" of water with motor up.
Comes with everything needed, including oars, pump, even has a $300.00 carry bag that the RIB is stored in.

I will take $4,900.00 for it all, including the trailer, or, $4,400.00 and I’ll keep the trailer.
I will also take guns on trade, as many as you care to trade. Prefer handguns, might consider long guns, MIGHT !!! NO JUNK !!!

This RIB is like new, wet about 10 times, engine is washed and waxed after every use, I’m so anal about my toys it’s fodder for my friends to make fun of me.
Here we are at the ICW in Wilmington last Saturday. It’s great to be able to find a private beach to yourself !!! It’s no wonder and there’s a reason, Navy SEAL teams and rescue squads use RIB’s, they’re amazing !

This gun is called the model 500 because it is designed to chamber 3"" magnum shells. The gun holds five 2.75"" shells, or four 3"" shells and one in the chamber. I have had this gun for a few months, and I have only fired it at one session. Only fifty rounds of buckshot have been put through it. After that it was broken down, cleaned, and oiled. It is still pretty new. It has what is known as the Lightning Bolt-Action. Also known as the Accu-Trigger. That means that the trigger has a skeletonized lightning bolt trigger blade in front of the trigger which can be adjusted from 2 to 7 pounds. This will save you time and money because you will not need to take this shotgun to a gunsmith to adjust the trigger. This was my first shotgun that i have ever owned. Although I've only shot it once, it was a pleasant experience. This shotgun has a RIFLED BARREL. Which means NO RIFLED SLUGS. You will ruin the barrel. Only sabot style slugs. I am firm on the price of $200.00. I need to sell fast which is why I knocked the price down to $200.

I can be reached from 5:00pm to around 10:30pm Monday through Friday. On the weekends, anytime during the day will be fine. Please don't waste my time because I will definitely not be wasting yours. Thank you.

Manufactured from 1984 - 1986; predecessor of the Express; but, WAY better made. The differences from this shotgun and the Wingmaster are a cast trigger housing instead of machined aluminum and a lower grade walnut with cheaper finish.

Great condition, excellent bluing, minor scratches and dings and a bit of varnish wear on the stock. Clean, no rust, smooth action; and very evident that it has not had a lot of rounds through it.

Magazine is plugged for waterfowling; only 3 shells can be loaded in this shotgun without removing the plug.

It has the original blade bayonet, original cleaning rod, original cleaning kit, 10 stripper clips, 200 rounds of Russian match grade 7.62x39 ammo, and case.

I know what this gun is worth as would any serious SKS collector so please don't try to low ball me and compare this with the Yugo's and Norinco's out there.

This pistol functions flawlessly as do the magazines. I also have a custom made genuine leather in the waist band holster that will come with it. I have shot less than 300 rounds through this PT 92, previous owner claimed he also shot less than this. I do not have the original box. The DA trigger is very smooth and light as is the SA being very, very light. The reset is quite favorable as well. The previous owner had some sort of laser attachment mounted on the trigger guard, so there is a small drilled hole in the bottom of the guard. This does not affect the strength of the metal nor the action of this pistol. I'm selling this pistol because I have so many 9mms.

No, this is not a Beretta knock off, it is made in a Beretta factory with original Beretta machinery by Taurus under license. Look it up.

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components

- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories

I don't know everything about it but this is what I know.
Ackley Improved chambers blow out the shoulder of the case to decrease body taper and increase shoulder angle, resulting in a higher case capacity. This will make a .30-06 shoot like a .300 Win. Mag. It is built on a Mauser Action which has had the ""cock on open"" conversion done and the rear sight milled off and tapped for a 1 piece base. It is fitted with a medium/heavy Military Barrel that was brand new for a .30 cal machine gun on an army tank. It started at 30"" but has been cut down to 22"" and reblued. I'm not sure what trigger was used but it feels light and crisp. It has a Leupold M8 6X which is a fixed 6 power. The stock has been bedded and is a nice piece of wood but does have some dings from over the years.
This gun has only had a couple of boxes of shells through it since it was built. It is a sub MOA gun with good 168 gr. ammo. My dad's knees were bad and he never really got to hunt with it. He didn't even blow out enough cases to ever reload for it.

All and all this is a great rifle at a great price just in time for hunting season! $550.00 or best offer"

I prefer a face to face transaction if in Michigan. I am in Taylor, but I do travel to Harrison/Clare/Houghton area every month or so.   I will ship firearm to another state after I receive a cashiers check for payment or a personal check (will not ship until check clears) & I receive a copy of your FFL dealers license with your name on it to ship the rifle there. Or if you are out of state and don't feel comfortable sending money there is an option: A buyer may wish to use an escrow service such as Tradiator.com at their expense. How Tradiator works; Buyer can open an account, send the payment to them to hold in escrow, buyer is then shipped the firearm for inspection, after buyer is satisfied, Tradiator releases the funds to the seller.  They obviously do this for a fee which would be the resposibility of the buyer. This is just an option to protect the buyer if you don't feel comfortable sending the funds.
You are responsible for know the firearm laws of your state you live in!

In the past few years I have had the starter, alternator, battery, most the interior door handles/panels/parts replaced because they broke with wear and tare. And who knows what else. With parts in labor I have dumped a ton of money into this I've just lost interest in continuing this project and have no desire to take on the labor and or costs for redoing the body/paint. That is really the only negative is the paint and body needs some work. The bumpers need some new clips all around and there is some rusting and a lot of clear coat coming off. The onlything mechanical wise is that it needs some new synchronizers it does not grab 2nd gear that well. All gears work great it just doesn't grab into 2nd really well. Asking $3000OBO. Would consider trades for automobiles among some other quality items."

Modeled after the familiar full size Motocross bikes, the LXR Fourteen is close in size to the current 85cc bikes but uses a GPX Moto 160cc 4stroke giving it a smooth power band from start to finish. The LXR Fourteen uses the ""Pitster Progressive Link"" rear suspension system and comes standard with features like; frame guards, brake guards, and 1-1/8"" tapered fat bars. Optional spring rates and linkage pull rods the LXR is great for adults and kids.this bike is shorter then a 125cc but is the same height. the bad is the second gear went out but you can still ride it and it drives fine you just need to skip second.now i got the new second gear and engine gasket kit to fix. it just needs to be install. i already had a quote for labor to fix it and it was only $125.

All in all I have about $4300 into this build, and am discounting it because I have fired it.  I zeroed it at 25 yards, and then showed it off a few times.  But as I also have a LWRC PSD Pistol, and a DTA SRS in .338LM, I have no need for the middle gun, since I am using the money from this sale to grab the .308 barrel kit for the DTA.  We will meet at any of the metro gun shops to exchange money for the rifle.  Dury's would be best, but I can travel as my gas is free.  At the time of exchange we can fill out the appropriate ATF forms if any are legally required.  I will pay for the transfer forms personally if any cost is presented.
