Part# 6263 in Dark Earth Price $700.00. There is nothing wrong with this stock at all. I just want to get a different gun so I'm going to sale this one. The stock has had a professional gunsmith (not me) mill the spot in the stock where the recoil lug goes for a Tubbs 2000 recoil lug. This doesn't effect anything for someone using it on a factory Remington 700 setup. It only helps you out if you have or want to install the highly recommended Tubbs Recoil lug for accuracy. I had to pay for it and the gunsmith labor so you can pick this up for free with the purchase of this stock. Remember this will not effect your setup if you just have a stock Remington 700 SA (Short Action 243 or 308). It will still drop right in. This is for the stock only. The whole gun can be for purchase if interested. The gun is a Remington 700 Tactical .308 20"" barrel that's threaded and has a AAC Brakeout Muzzle Brake. It has a Badgers Ordinance Oversize bolt knob and the trigger has also been worked, all of this has been done by a professional gunsmith. The scope is also for sale if you want it. Its a Night Force NXS 5.5-22x50 w/ NP-R1 reticle. The scope is $1600.00 by itself. The rifle & stock by its self are $1600.00. If you want to purchase everything the total is $3000.00 and its a heck of a deal since I have way more invested. Buyer will pay shipping and insurance.

This rifle is double digit serial number, Yes two number serial. Rifle was used by Century arms as their Display rifle and submitted at the 2009 Shot Show. This rifle is immaculate, and comes with all prominence proving the rifle was the display rifle including the red tag placed around trigger guard with the shot show markings and the original owners manual. This rifle is chambered in 8MM mauser and the glass is in fantastic condition. This rifle is milled w/ tapered heavy BBL and threaded for suppressor. Other than looks it has nothing in common with a Dragonuv or PSL and far out classes them. Standard effective range of 850 Meters with decent shooters out to over 1,000 with a trained shooter is normal for this rifle. The barrel is heavy BBL unlike the Dragonuv or PSL and the receiver is milled not stamped cheaply like the Dragunov and PSL with a beautiful smooth finish. 
The scope was designed by the Russians as a passive IR detection scope meaning that the radioactive materials in the scope can detect IR light. The scope was used to look for snipers at night that used IR illuminated night vision without giving away the Russian snipers position as the Russian scope detects IR light and doesn't emit it. This is a Counter Sniper Rifle. Designed as such from the factory. This rifle is currently used by Russia, Croatia, Kosovo, Czech Republic, Romania, Bosnia and North Korea.

One picture is from gunshow review of the exact rifle for sale that was shown in the magazine, Picture was taken at ShotShow, this picture is of the actual rifle being sold that was presented by Century Arms to represent their brand to the public and dealers alike.

Rifle will come with williams reciever sight (not mounted). I refinished the wood with danish oil and several clear coats then polished to a 1500 grit shine. It is not perfect but looks way better than the factory motor oil stain that was on there. Rifle shoots good, shoulders fast, and hits hard. It is used and has been hunted so expect normal wear. The only abnormal thing about it is the machine screw through the front barrel band. That is a story all on its own, call it a casualty of the refinishing process... Anyhow, I have 45, 454 brass and dies that can be had for a small fee as well. This is a rare and powerfull little rifle that works very well, the only reason I'm parting with it is my old eyes just cant pick the critters out of the brush like they used to.

The SE-2 is the first and only AR-15 pistol grip to be integrated with an ambidextrous sling mount. The SE-2 is available in two versions. The Hook Mount provides a loop compatible with most common sling hooks; The Swivel Mount allows the attachment of push-button sling swivels.

The SE-2's sling mount is located above the hand and below the buffer tube, with a low profile design that stays out of the way of even fully collapsed M4-style stocks. When added to AR pistols, the SE-2 provides excellent one-handed control while providing sling attachment that doesn't clutter up the receiver extension.

Extensive strength testing has been performed on the SE-2 to ensure a reliable attachment point that you can depend on.

Just like the original SE-1 Pistol Grip, the design of the SE-2 enhances weapon ergonomics and functionality, bringing M16, M4 and AR-15 style weapons to a higher level of control and comfort. The grip has been designed for a wide range of hand sizes and shooting demands. Features include a smooth integral trigger guard to increase comfort, textured surface for added grip and storage for batteries or other equipment.

The SE-2 Sling Grip is available in Black, Flat Dark Earth"

This is not modeled after the RPK. It is an AK47. This is a pre-Assault weapons ban rifle for those of you that frequently travel to N.Y. Like myself. I'm in no rush to sell or trade I'm just seeing what's out there. I'm looking for something for more precision shooting. I'm open to any and all trades though. That being said this is a bit on the higher end as far as AK's are concerned. Everything from the barrel fit and tolerances down to the trigger group(which is smoother than the g2's everyone loves so much). All matching wood furniture, original sling,magazine etc. bought this a long while ago and it has sat in the safe after I put 2 mags through it. I've just been keeping it as an AK purist collectible. Like I said, no rush I'm not going to jump at an offer and if you have something worth more, that's great, but Im not looking to throw cash out of pocket on anything. Like I said this is a higher end piece, right up there with the likes of arsenals and such, so don't try and offer an off the shelf sps and expect much of a response, unless it's sporting a 20MOA rail and decent glass. I'm a fan of the 700 action. I'm not huge on .308, but if you've got a socom II or 16 with 2 or more mags I'd take that deal. Also if you've got top end optics, I may bite on a deal. No Leupold MKIV offers please, Id like TOP end optics.

It usually stays in my night stand next to my bed but every once in a while I will bring it out to punch holes in some paper. This glock eats everything. I have never had a single issue with this gun. I opted for the gen 2 because I hear the gen 3 and 4 had some slight extractor issues. I wanted a gun that would never fail so i bought this gen. I am extremely happy with the gun. This glock is pretty much stock. It has the tru glo tritium night sights which were 100 dollars and an extended mag release which i like alot. I also replaced the guide rod and recoil spring even though it really wasn't needed. The gun comes with four magazines. Two are 17 rounders and two are 10 rounders. There is a FFl dealer 5 or 6 miles from my house where the gun can be transferred at. I will not sell to anyone that does not have a clear pistol permit ready to be transferred.

It is a Browning built shotgun and not a Remington built one (Remington also built the A5 for Browning). The serial number starts with 2V which makes it a 1962 Magnum. The barrel has a full choke and is 31.5"" long. The recoil on this magnum allows for the shooting of 2.75"" shells as well. This shotgun is currently setup to shoot the 2.75"" shells and I have the brass rings to increase the recoil pressure for the 3"" magnum shells along with the instruction sheet that tells you how to do it (quite simple to do) and I have the original ""Duck Plug"" for this shotgun. My shotgun comes with an original Browning soft case for a long shotgun. The Barrel bore is like new, the blue is in very good condition and the wood is in good condition. The wood is not cracked anywhere but does have a few small dings with a few places where the hard clear finish has been chipped off. This is a nice old shotgun (50years-old) and it shoots well. These old full choke barrels are not recommended for steel shot but work just fine with lead shot.

I have decided to sell/trade the old shotgun because it's just too long for home defense and I'm not a duck, goose or turkey hunter. It's also a great trap and skeet gun, of which I do not do either. That long barrel with a full choke shoots a very tight pattern for a very long distance so it is a great distance shooter.

I am asking $575 or best reasonable cash offer. I will consider other interesting firearm trades. I would really like a Taurus Judge or a 410ga semi-auto shotgun, .22 magnum rifles and semi-auto pistols. What do you have??? Email, call or text 5zero5-6one0-five two91 with a question or information about something you have to trade. Thanks for looking."
