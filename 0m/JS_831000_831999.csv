This rifle is located in Durango, CO I would be willing to meet a buyer at a dealer in Farmington, Aztec, or Bloomfield to do the transfer. A face to face deal without a dealer in New Mexico is not an option since I am a Colorado resident. Contact me via email with a phone number. 
Trades
-Quality AR-15 optics as a partial trade. Not looking for a scope more along the lines of an Aimpoint M2 or similar.
-Ammo- 5.56/.223, 9mm, and .308 
-Would also consider a few handguns as partial trade. If trading for a handgun I would require to do face to face In Colorado at a dealer. Might be interested in XD/XDM 9 compact, M&P 9mm, Taurus Judge, possibly a couple other compacts. 
If shipped you are responsible for knowing all state and federal laws. If face to face valid DL to prove your age is required if I question it and you must be legal to own a firearm. I wont sell to anyone who I think might misuse the firearm."

20"", chromoly steel free-floating, button-rifled, fluted barrel Recessed hunting muzzle crown Lightweight and ergonomic, it points instinctively Receiver-length Picatinny rail for optics Clean-breaking trigger is factory set to 4-1/2 lbs. Comes with a four-round magazine Engineered with today’s big-game hunter in mind, the R-25 boasts some of the most advanced design features available in AR-style rifles. The 20"", chromoly free-floating, button-rifled barrel helps even the beginning marksman shoot tighter groups. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block increase rigidity, reduce weight and enhance barrel cooling. A recessed hunting muzzle crown aids accuracy as well. Much of the barrel is surrounded by a machined-aluminum forend tube. The R-25’s overall light weight and ergonomic design make handling it a joy. It points instinctively, and a receiver-length Picatinny rail atop the action accommodates your choice of optics or accessories. The clean-breaking, single-stage hunting trigger is factory set to 4-1/2 lbs. For concealment, the R-25 is covered in Mossy Oak® Treestand® camo. Includes a four-round magazine, making them legal for hunting in most states. Compatible with magazines and accessories that fit other AR-type rifles chambered for .308 Winchester-based cartridges.

It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public.

Hello and Thank you for checking out our auction. Up for auction is a brand new in box Barrett M107A1 CQ .50 BMG with a 20"" barrel. Mounted on this beast is a Japan Vortex Razor 5-20X50 ILL. Please check availability before bidding.

A whole new legend.
It may be related to the Model M82A1, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle’s durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is easily adjustable from either side.

The M107A1 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that’s optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

Features:
Suppressor-ready muzzle brake.
Lightweight quick-detach bipod with modular feet.
Accepts M1913 accessory rails.
Thermal cheek guard.
Modular hand-grip mounted on M1913 rail.

No disrespect, but I don't want to pay retail price (or Higher) for your used gun.  MSRP on these is $279-$309.  Paying $450 for your USED gun makes no sense, unless you've invested in some upgrades.  I know people have gone gun crazy, but this really doesn't compare to the other guns folks are trying to snatch up before it is too late."

Mowrey did things only one way and that was the best. Stock is northern cherry, brass furniture and action, German silver blade sight and heavy barrel. Weighs 10 pounds and well balanced.

Barrel: very high tensile strength (87,500 psi) cold rolled from C-1213 steel. Eight cut grooves, 0.10 deep and equal width (takes a patch ball best.) One turn in 60 inches means accuracy and round ball only. The barrel is 1 inch across the flats and 32 inches long.

Brass: High density “Inco” brass caste from pure ingots, not scrap.

50 Caliber Charge: 125 grains of FFg black powder should produce a muzzle energy of 1,985 pound feet and energy of 2,300 feet per second.

Included is an unopened pound of Pyrodex, bullet mold (.495), lots of percussion caps, brass powder measure, several brass cappers, nipple wrench, cleaning hose, perhaps a thousand round ball, patches, cleaning/patch solution, and lots more.

Black powder firearms can be sold to someone in any state without restriction other than perhaps age.  (Except the Pyrodex and percussion caps can't be shipped and you won't like the cost of shipping the lead.)

Disclosure:  With the new Colorado law I don't know if come July 1 even black powder guns will have to be sold via a Federal Firearms License holder.  I'd move quickly with all Colorado firearms purchases as they will soon all be recorded on the dealers books (ATFE has access to all FFL holder records) you will have to complete a 4473 and have a background check currently costing $10 and pay something to the dealer."

I purchased this used and got a great deal at $190 (they usually retail for $255). The previous owner used a dremel on the INSIDE of the front end to try and get a can to fit underneath on a SBR (see pic). These marks are purely cosmetic, have no functional impact, and I planned to just hit it with a quick spray of hi-temp black spray paint to cover the exposed Aluminum. 

The outside of the rail system doesn't have a single mark on it and is in like new condition. It comes in original box with all instructions, tools, and three modular rail sections to mount anywhere you want on the handguard.

My problem is that my upper has a mid length (9"") gas system. I thought since my factory handguards were 9"", that this 11"" rail would work fine. Unfortunately, the position of the gas block interferes with the folding sight. If you have a standard 7"" gas system, this is the handguard for you.

I like this rail so much, that I am going to spend $270 to buy the 13"" version that fits mid length rifles (I'll have to buy a new one). However, I've got to get some of my money back out of this one in order to afford it. I'll take a loss of $10 plus the $8 I spent on shipping and will sell for $180.

Do your research...these are proven reliable and generally accepted as one of the best drums on the market.

Buyer must meet in Whatcom county or will ship at buyer's expense. (actual shipping cost)

Yes the price is ridiculous, but look at what these are going for on eBay and gunbroker.
I don't want to take advantage of anyone.  Free will and the free market are still at play here.

I would prefer not to sell, but if someone really wants one of these and is willing to pay the procrastinator's premium...I would have to oblige.

Trades will be considered...it never hurts to ask.

Because these are currently unavailable anywhere, I reserve the right to sell to the person with the highest offer, as I expect multiple responses to this ad.

I bought all of these parts brand new and had this rifle built with all the parts that matter. I put this rifle through a 60 round break in procedure the first time i had it out. It was primarily used as a hunting rifle and for some occasional target shooting. This rifle was thoroughly cleaned after each outing as every rifle should be, and has under 300 rounds through it total on the high side. I wrapped it in camo form self cling camouflage wrap (not sticky) to keep it scratch free and also to camouflage it for hunting. This is such an easy rifle to shoot accurately and  basically has no recoil at all. Very well taken care of one of a kind rifle. Buyer must sign a bill of sale, and the price is $3,000 cash only. Price reflects current market value and the parts used. Serious inquiries only please. Call me at an appropriate time please at (716) 725-two one six two"

2 black 4RUNNERS only one has engine both have clean title
This was a project... I started out with one 4runner(1992) that I bought in CO and never got the title plus the body was rusty...
I found a great deal on another 4runner(1990) in great shape good body, good engine, great 4x4 transmission... Great truck!
Problem with that one was it needed the door handles switched out and some other minor things... So I bought it, and took parts off the first one (1992 Red) to fix up the (1990 Black). 
Then I took all the doors and everything of value off the (1992 Red) and sold the frame and engine.
So no I have the 1990 in good working condition and a LOT of left over parts from the (1992 red).
Then I found a (1993 Black) 4RUNNER On craigslist with a 4 inch suspension lift and 33 inch tires!!! The guy gave me a great deal and I was off to the races on my big project for my ultimate 4runner!!!
The problem is I had to go out of state for work for a while, I'm back now but not for very long. I just don't have time for the project!
Everything is here to make a BADASS 4x4 MUDTRUCK 4RUNNER or whatever
I would like to trade for guns and or motorcycles

Bluing has been removed from metal parts and the finish has been removed from wood parts.
I bought it this way in 1988-89 out of my friend’s father’s estate.   I thought I might finish the job his father had started but never did (actually haven’t done anything with it except clean it every once in a while since I’ve had it.)  I’m old enough to know now that I’m not going to get the job done … am looking for someone with interest in finishing the job or someone who wants to use a great ole gun just as it is.

The vest is in excellent condition and has pals webbing for any molle gear you may want to attach. Included is a crotch flap that offers no ballistic protection and a neck guard with the same protection level as the vest. There of course is room to add level III or IV hard plates to protect against rifle cartridges. I will consider cash offers and firearms-related trades as listed below.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

Here is the description from the website.

P938 Nightmare Pistol, 9mm, Houge rubber grips, Ambi Safety, Night Sights, 6 Round Mag.


With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters."

Crimson Trace presents the MVF-515 Green; a revolutionary, patent-pending concept that combines three tactical tools for your AR style rifle into a single modular package. With a rock-solid 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum hard-anodized tang as the foundation of the foregrip, the unit also features a green laser sight and a 150/200-Lumen LED light module. The MVF-515 Green leverages advanced technology to ensure long battery life and rugged durability through a wider range of conditions than consumer grade green lasers. Hot or cold, light or dark, the MVF-515 Green readily provides the most complete sighting and target identification system available anywhere. The laser and light are instinctively activated as you hold the weapon, and activation switches are ambidextrous. This allows operators to select the light or the laser individually or simultaneously. Both laser and light functions are programmable with three illumination modes to select from including: independent momentary, strobe or constant beam. A master on/off switch permits complete shutdown of either laser or light. Being a modular unit, users may separately purchase a red laser module for direct replacement.
