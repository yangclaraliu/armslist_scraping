These were original No4 MK1s used during ww2 and post war they had a few small features changed such as the trigger being attached to the receiver rather than the trigger guard like in the older models.

This one is pretty rare in that ALL the metal parts are stamped matching. Those are Bolt,Receiver and the Magazine.
The finish is average with other No4 Mk1s I have seen and would grade it as Fair.
Bore is dark and it has crud in there, the lands and grooves are strong and I fired it/cleaned it a bit and most of the crud should come right out with some rounds down range followed by a good brushing.

It does have a crack in the stock that appears to be an arsenal repair, it feels extremely sturdy, crack wont flex at all with pressure, fires fine. Its right at the recoil lug so to me its purely cosmetic. I will let you be the judge.
This one has an extremely rare Star on the receiver which means this may be a Lend Lease from the british to the soviets during ww2.

Fires great, action is very smooth, great trigger. I purchased this because I had around 300 .303 left to fire and just wanted to shoot it off. Well apparently 1 in 5 of my rounds still fired(gah that sucks) so this is up.

Up for sale or trade is a Colt Defender .45 acp. I bought it used a while ago so I am not sure the exact round count. There are a few of light scratches on the frame and a tiny nick on the slide, other than that the gun is in great condition. Shoots flawlessly! I recently changed the the spring set on the guide rod. The factory mag gave me a little trouble so I purchased 2 Kimber mags to use, and they work flawlessly. Also installed is a set of XS Big Dot night sights Link. Which are really awesome especially on this gun. Also included in the package is a crossbreed supertuck horse hide IWB holster.
I saved all of the things that came off it, in case the new owner wanted them: original mag, original springs, factory novak sights. I am not sure how to price this because it does have a few scratches but has extras.

This is what it has based on new pricing
Colt Defender new price: $950-$1050
XS Big Dot sights new price: $120 + ship
2 Kimber SS 7+1 mags: $40
Crossbreed supertuck horsehide: $85 +ship

So based on new prices I have around $1250 value in it. But since it is used with a few scratches and no box. I will offer trade value of $1100 or $1050 cash or best offer. Feel free to make offer the worst I can say is no, but please no low balls. I am interested in trading for a good quality, good condition full size 1911 in .45acp +/- cash.

Gun is used but in great condition, with ~500 rounds down the barrel.  No malfunctions over its service life, I am the original owner.  Exterior might have some slight/ light holster type wear (really hard to see), and a few minor marks on frame, but overall looks like new.  4"" barrel looks clean and bright.

Gun comes with 2-15 round mags, factory case with 2 gunlock keys (lock the pistol for when its not in use), and an AKJ concealco IWB leather holster.  Pistol is a great shooter with extremely light felt recoil and quick follow-up shots, plus innovative trapezoidal sights.  No issues with it, I just seldom shoot it nowadays and need to thin the gun collection."

That is not a typo, CZ sells CZ-75s with a Kadet kit in place of the normal 9mm upper. I sent it off to Stuart Wong to have a CZC SAO trigger and a competition hammer installed. He also took the effort to find the right mainspring for the majority of bulk pack ammo. It comes with additional springs for tuning should your particular favorite not run as well as you'd like. I installed a FO front sight and blacked out the rear adjustable dots with a permanent marker. I put on some skate tape and CZC aluminum grips for better grip. Comes with two mags, the original case, manual, and an UPLULA that I modified to work with it.

This pistol is incredibly comfortable to shoot. The recoil is very very low due to the minimal slide mass and the weight of the steel frame. This would be an excellent pistol for steel challenge."

Im asking $400 for everything. I'll make sure the steel mag is full when you purchase it. 

I do ask that you show me a valid NC Drivers license and as well as a pistol purchase permit/CCW to validate that you are not a felon."

I want to buy your Old, Rusty, Broken or Fire Damaged Winchester Rifle - Parts missing = OK. Broken, Does Not Work = OK Model, year not important. Older, the better! If you have a project that you will ""get to one day"" and haven't - I want to buy it. I'll use the parts to make another Winchester almost new again! In the medical field you could say that I do ""transplants"" to patients needing a new heart, lung or such. Your old Winchester will live again but in another body. Go now, to the fartherest corner of your shop and dig out that old, tired soldier and send it to me. I'll prepare it for surgery.
You'll be surprised how much I'll pay for it!!
I pay CA$H. -or- I have Shotgun Barrels to offer for trade. (choose from 300) I also have over 250 rifle barrels for trade! I might even find a real shootin' gun to trade for yours.

The barrel has been polished along with the magazines.

This pistol comes complete with case, all paperwork and factory Ruger lock.

There are two magazines included even though the pics only show one.

The only reason I am selling / trading is because I have converted all my pistols to 40 caliber.

These pistols new run around the $325 mark, I know this pistol is not new but the polished barrel, polished mags and OD Dura Coat job is worth something when you consider a Dura Coat job is in the $125 range. 

As a bonus, the two magazines come loaded with the old school nickel plated hydra shocks which is very hard to find anymore and usually run about a $1 a round.

I am NOT IN NEED of cash so low ball offers / trades will be ignored.

I am sensible so if you have a trade that is worth more than my pistol I will add appropriate funds otherwise trade value is $400 or cash price is $300 firm.

5kW Diesel Generator (Military Model #:  MEP002A):
Model:  Libby Corp, MEP002A
Year:  9/91
Hours of Usage:  1923
Continuous Power Rating:  5 Kilowatt (kW), 60hz at 80% power factor below 5,000 feet above sea level. (The US Military underrates their units by at least 25%.)
Current Type:  Alternating Current (AC)
Line to Line Voltage (Volts):  120 and 240 volts
Amp Output:  41.6 amps (assumes 120 volt output and 5,000 watt rating. The US Military underrates their units by at least 25%.  If you assume 6,250 watts and 120 volt output, you arrive at 52 amps.
Voltage:  120V (single phase, 2 wire), 120/240V (single phase, 3 wire), 120/208V (3-phase, 4 wire)
Phases:  Single AND Three on-the-fly
Fuel Type:  Diesel (Bio-diesel retrofits are possible assuming 1) the bio-diesel is preheated properly and 2) the bio-diesel is of high quality and purity)
# of Cylinders:  2
RPM:  1,800  (Note that most consumer units run hot and fast at 3,600 RPMs are not capable of continuous use.)
Engine Manufacturer:  Onan (now Cummins Onan - a world leader in diesel engine technology)
Engine Type:  Four Cycle
Displacement:  70 cubic inches (1147 cc.)
Compression Ratio:  19:1
Horsepower:  8.9 @ 1800 RPM (0-5000 ft above sea level)
Governor:  Internal flyball; external adjustment
Cooling Method:  Air-Cooled (i.e. not liquid-cooled; no water pump, radiator or coolant needed which radically reduces maintenance costs)
Excitor Type:  Self-Excited
Body Material:  Steel
Weight:  960 lbs
Dimensions:  51"" x 32"" x 37"" (L x W x H)
Cubage:  35 cubic feet
Fuel Filters:  Tank fuel strainer for large particulates; followed by NAPA brand Water Separator Filter; followed by a 6 Micron Spin-On Fuel Filter.
Fuel Pumps:  Three redundant electric fuel pumps (one is for auxiliary fuel source such as a 55 gallon drum); one master mechanical injector pump.
Air Filter:  Large and easily replaceable air filter with cold-weather intake diverter. You can switch from normal air filtration to the cold-weather setting that will suck air in over the exhaust manifold to pre-heat the air. This is an excellent cold weather feature.
Cold Weather Kit:  Includes:  air intake pre-heat, glow plugs, 24 volt cold weather starting system. You will not find more durable cold-weather features in any unit on the market.
Fuel Tank Capacity:  6.75 gallons (25.5 liters)
Lubricating Oil Capacity (Less Filter):  3 quarts, 4 quarts if filter is changed (2.8 liters, 3.7 liters if filter is changed)
Ventilation requirements (Total):  1350 CFM at 1800 RPM
 
 
Again the major differences between this generator and typical Big Box Generators are the following:

1.  These generators are for Prime Power (i.e. continuous running over days, weeks and months).  Big Box generators are not meant to run for more than 3-4 hours. These generators are usually called ""Portable"" or ""Standby"" generators. 
2.  Durability:  This genset weighs in at 960 lbs versus their's at 86 lbs.  This genset can output an easy 5000 Watt continuous power stream while the their's can output only 3500.  Everything on our units is built to last and run for a long long time.
3.  Low RPM:  This genset runs at 1800 RPM versus their's at 3600 RPM. What does this mean? This unit runs more slowly at lower temperatures, which helps enable the continuous run capabilities that their units can't. Their units will literally burn out if attempted to run for 3 days straight during a power outage.
4.  Diesel:  Although both this unit and the one being compared are diesel, most cheap generators run on gasoline, which is a terrible fuel for generators -- the engines run hotter, are more expensive to maintain (often too expensive to repair) and gasoline has a reduced shelf-life as an emergency/standby fuel.
5.  Less Expensive:  This generator is significantly less expensive for a better product. Yes, they are used, but our units are considered ""investment grade"" as they are worth fixing, rebuilding and maintaining. All components are easy to source through GMG or your local auto store.  Their units are typically throw-away and carry a 12 month warranty -- everything is 'used' after the warranty ends.
6.  More Features:  Many features are included in these units such as Three Phase capabilities, Aux Fuel pump, all-weather kit, cold-weather features, grounding rods for safety, redundant fuel pumps, redundant fuel filters, and the list goes on and on!"

This isn't one of those odd ball colors, that you mostly find at the outlet stores. It's a very classy, classic color scheme, beautiful bag, as seen in some of the pictures below.
You can call any Coach store to verify the authenticity, we can even meet at a Coach store if you prefer.
When calling you can't say you want to verify you have a certain serial number and question it's authenticity, so knock off artists/companies can't call and fish for real numbers. It's a Coach company policy. SO, when calling state you have this particular bag, serial number XXXX and that you'd like to get it replace since it was ruined by the dog, or whatever. They'll look it up tell you when it was manufactured, date of release, etc etc and probably that they don't have any in stock, being that it's an old line, and try to sell you on a current line they have in store.

It comes equipped with a tapco folding stock, tapco intrafuse handguards, and a black pistol grip. It also has a rail mount that has been welded on top of the dust cover. It is set up for standard weaver mounts. There is no front sight base but these can be found online for cheap.  The barrel is threaded and this is the more desirable straight cut receiver. This gun is not perfect but it will serve you well for years to come. The bore is bright and shiny and the rifling is strong. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me. I will consider trades but cash is king. Trades must be extremely worth my while because my asking price is much less than what others are selling for. This baby still shoots like a dream.

Can carry as many as 12 AR mags and four psitol mags, though I genreally ran it with between 4-7 AR mags, and 2 pistol mags. Been modified with SKD dual Bungee retainers (~$7 a pice) so that mags are retained more securely, three pouches have been modified as such, though the bungees can be removed since they are velcroed in for use with other none AR mags. Also have a fourth retainer that was meant for the fourth pouch, but I ended up adding the eagle thumb break system to the rig to carry a pisto, works very well with an M9 or Glock with tact lightl. It can be removed without much fuss the original strap re-installed.

While these rifles are obtainable in California, they are in no way easy to get since Larue is currently on a 6-12 month back order on these and let's just say that California is not on Larue's high priority state.

With this you get the following:
-Rifle, Larue case, manual and Larue's test target 
-2x UDE 30 round rebuilds (these are only obtainable through LT and normal California ones are pinned)
-Larue Tactical OBR QD sling mount
-Larue Troy battle sights (front and rear)
-Larue Prone Optimization Device)
-Larue UDE Foward Universal Grip
-Larue UDE handstops x2
-Surefire MB556K (timed to Surefire specs)

I am selling for the price listed in the ad... if you don't like it then throw your name on a waiting list and piece it together. Low ballers will be ignored and there's not much I'm looking for in trade. I would entertain a partial trade (with cash on your end) for a 14.5"" M4 looking AR (Colt, Spikes, LMT, BCM, etc)"

The Matrix™ is the next generation of thermoplastic holsters and accessories from Galco. It is water friendly, lightweight, comfortable to wear, easy on the budget, and almost maintenance free!

Among all the many choices for plastic holsters in the marketplace today, why does the Matrix stand out? Most obviously, in appearance – unlike so many other harsh, mechanical-looking plastic holsters, the Matrix resembles a Galco hand-molded leather holster. Most importantly, in strength: Because it is injection molded, it is considerably more durable and free of the structural weaknesses associated with other manufacturing methods.

As the story goes, all gunsmiths who made these during the time period in Belgium used the same proof, so there is literally no way of tracking who created it, other than it is Belgium. From research, they seem to sell from several hundred dollars up into the thousands for particular manufacturers with documentation or the like. They use a 22 CB (conical ball) Cap and were used for indoor shooting.

This is a beautiful gun, beautiful engraving and craftsmanship, with an unknown history. Nice for it's age, but not pristine.

Best offer cash or trade for AR Uppers, AK's, HD shotgun, full-size 1911 (will add cash).  Make an offer, the worst that can happen is you get ignored.

Arsenal's write-up is here, they can describe it better than I ever could:  [url]http://www.arsenalinc.com/usa/pages.php?pageid=21[/url]

The complete package is as follows:

SLR-106FR (5.56) with triangle folding stock
Ultimak M2-B
Manticore Arms NightShroud MKII flash hider
Tapco G2 single-hook trigger group
Bulgarian Circle-10 Waffle Mags (10 each)
Aimpoint PRO (Patrol Rifle Optic)
US Palm Grip
Viking Tactics VTAC Sling


This thing is sweet, kicks less than an AR, and I swear is every bit as accurate.  1:7 twist rate, so you can shoot the heavy pills.  If I recall correctly, weighs in with an empty mag at 8.6 pounds.  The Aimpoint has a 3-year on-time battery life, which has a good two years left on it, so you never have to worry about fiddling with your RDS...it's always on, just grab and go.

Fits in a tennis racket case for those times requiring discretion. Folder locks solid open and closed.  

Shoots anything you can feed it, Wolf (as any good Kalash should), but has mostly eaten Federal 55gr.  Never had a malfunction, round count is around 500 by my recollection.  

Will only sell entire package, please. :)

Bought from a person off this site.  I already have one and shoot it and thought a 2nd would be good to have.  Well I have had it a month or so and it's just sitting in the safe so I thought I'd put it out there and see if anyone has something for trade or would like to buy it.

Gun is like new so if you have been thinking about buying one, give me a shout and save yourself some money for ammo.  If your looking for a gun to buy cheap and flip, this one's not for you."

It shoots like no .45 you've ever fired due to its compensator and custom guide rods, etc. and the trigger is phenomenal. It would easily cost $2000-$2500 to build this gun. The only problem with this gun is that it has cosmetic wear on the frame and slide. Performance is not affected in any way by its cosmetic wear.

XDM Features

XDM DESIGN

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.

(M)odel Contour Frame

The ideal grip angle of the XD has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.

(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations

Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.

(M)ega-Lock Texture

The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 

The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

XDM TECHNOLOGY

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.

(M)elonite

Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 

The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M)is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

(M)atch Grade Barrel

Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry


(M)inimal Reset Trigger

The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

XDM INNOVATIONS

The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD is now captured in the all new XD(M) line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M) series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.

(M)inimal Error Disassembly


Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.

(M)aximum Reach Mag Release


The modified contour of the new XD(M)grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.

(M)ega Capacity Magazine


The new XD(M) Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR Mag 
 X-Tension (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the 
 .40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.

XDM PERSONALIZATION

Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M), you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.

(M)ould-Tru Backstraps


With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.

(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System


A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position. 

(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case


Your total XD(M) experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.

(M)agazine X-Tensions


With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions, SPRINGFIELD ARMORYhas added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)


XDM STANDARDS

In 2001, Springfield Armory set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. With the introduction of the XD polymer pistol, they did just that….

Loaded Chamber Indicator

The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.

Striker Status Indicator

The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. 


USA Trigger System

The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.

Grip Safety

Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

This kit turns your 10/22 into a Tommy Gun! Check out the website above.
The 10/22 receiver drops into the kit with no modifications to the 10/22! You still use 10/22 mags. 
This one is set up as the 'Squad Leader' military M1 version, but also included is the 'Gangster' foregrip, rear sight and muzzle tip, so you can switch between the looks!! 

The kits sell for $300 each- I've got both, plus one of the optional M1 'stick' mag conversions!

I'll sell the rifle complete as shown with extra Gangster kit for $500, or the two kits PLUS the 16"" barrel for $300. (you need a 16"" barrel, not the normal 18.5"" that comes on most 10/22's)

The rifle has about 300 rounds through it and is in phenomenal shape. Larue Tactical makes some of the highest quality AR's in the industry with top shelf accuracy, reliability, and craftsmanship. 

While these rifles are obtainable in California, they are in no way easy to get since Larue is currently on a 6-12 month back order on these and let's just say that California is not on Larue's high priority state.

With this you get the following:
-Rifle, Larue case, manual and Larue's test target 
-2x UDE 30 round rebuilds (these are only obtainable through LT and normal California ones are pinned)
-Larue Tactical OBR QD sling mount
-Larue Troy battle sights (front and rear)
-Larue UDE Foward Universal Grip
-Larue UDE handstops x2
-Surefire MB556K (timed to Surefire specs)

I am selling for the price listed in the ad... if you don't like it then throw your name on a waiting list and piece it together. Low ballers will be ignored and there's not much I'm looking for in trade. I would entertain a partial trade (with cash on your end) for a 14.5"" M4 looking AR (Colt, Spikes, LMT, BCM, etc)"
