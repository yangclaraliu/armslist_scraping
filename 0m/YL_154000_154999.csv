That is a sweet deal for this condition of the pistol. I am pretty sure I know what it is worth considering my buddy got one in same exact condition for $500. Glocks can shoot thousands of rounds with minimal wear and tear so this is a great piece considering I have not shot it very much. I have almost $800 in this picture. 

I have a Glock 19 that was purchased on December 21, 2010. I bought it because my best friend had the same pistol and we wanted to have complete interchangeability between the handguns with magazines, holsters, and accessories we may buy. We shoot guns every Saturday and I would clean it every week even if I did not shoot it that week. This gun is my baby and has not had much ammo through it. I carried it more than I shot it and it has minimal holster wear on the slide. It comes with a Scherer 31 round magazine with a +2 baseplate. The magazine doesn't feed hollowpoints very well but works good with Full Metal Jacket rounds. I kept it loaded up with 28 rounds and in my car for if I had a really bad day. Comes with a BRAND SPANKIN' new Crimson Trace laser that I just installed on it. The laser is a wonder in itself! You can shoot from the most twisted uncomfortable positions (for example, under a car or leaning around a wall with only a small amount of yourself exposed) and be accurate. The laser is currently sighted in to be accurate from 5 steps away to as far as you can shoot and see your target. The laser also helps in dry fire practice because you can actually see if the laser moves when you pull the trigger and dry fire. It has helped me become a much better shooter. If you have never owned a handgun with a Crimson Trace you need to see what you are missing. They are incredible!
It also comes with a BlackHawk! Serpa level II holster in Gun Metal Gray. The holster really accents the Glock Tenifer finish and stands out above the crowd. I have had more than one person say ""Dude, that is a sick Glock you have there!""
I have the gun-lock that comes with it, the cleaning rod and bore brush (has not been used!) the fired brass from the factory, and all the cool pamphlets that Glock gives you when you buy one of their pistols.
So why am I selling such a great pistol? I really have my heart set on buying an AR-15 rifle. I am also interested in S&W M&P sub-compact handguns. .40 S&W is possible but 9mm would be the best! I have my eye on the new Smith&Wesson M&P15 as well.

Send me a text or give me a call if you are serious about buying because I always have my phone on me and I can answer further questions about it or arrange a meet. If you are just semi interested send me an email and I'll get back with you asap.

572,http://www.armslist.com/posts/154572,For Sale/Trade:  New TV show wants to buy your guns!,"Fayetteville, Fayetteville, North Carolina",$ 0,"Listed On: Monday, June 27, 2011",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Hi,

I hope you are all doing well! My name is Alan Stephens and I am an Associate Producer for a brand new gun shop TV series that will be filming in Fayetteville, NC. The show is very similar to the popular pawn shop series that air on truTV and History channel and will be filming at Guns Plus.

I wanted to reach out to see if anyone would be willing to come to Guns Plus and try to sell their fire arms on the show. We are set to film the first round of the show the weekend of July 9th.

We are looking for people that have antique and exotic high-end guns to sell. We're also looking for folks that want to buy guns. The segment would take about an hour to film and potential buyers and sellers would negotiate a deal with the owner of the shop and then test out the gun at the store's firing range. 

We have kind of a tight dead-line--so I'd love to speak with you or anyone else you may know that would be interested ASAP. Please feel free to forward this message to anyone you think would like to be on the show. You can call me at REDACTED or email at REDACTED.  If no interest, no worries and have a great day!


Here's a little more info on our show:

""Danger Pawn"" is a truTV, Zodiak Entertainment reality show revolving around the locally owned and run Guns Plus located in Spring Lake, NC on Bragg Boulevard. The show documents people and their possessions as they enter Guns Plus looking to make a deal. The shop buys and sells exotic high end and antique guns and weapons. Think the History Channel's ""Pawn Stars"" turned up a notch!

AND REMEMBER - THESE ARE REAL TRANSACTIONS. I NOR MY PRODUCTION TEAM CAN GUARANTEE YOU'LL GET YOUR ASKING PRICE FOR WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE SELLING OR PAWNING. WE'RE JUST THERE FILMING YOU. WE ENCOURAGE YOU HOWEVER, TO STAND YOUR GROUND AND NEGOTIATE FOR WHAT YOU WANT.


Thank you so much for your time and I look forward to hearing from you!

All the best,

Alan Stephens

Instruction/Assembly Book

Bought several years ago with the high hope of putting it together. Needless to say here it sits and someone who has the time should have their chance with it. As with all the kits there is NO receiver tube. It is a demil kit and not one of the kits that has all new parts minus tube. That being said it is an original Sten (or several Stens) with original parts.
It does not have any of the trigger springs or pins. It does have the bolt, barrel and T stock. A couple extras of some parts and missing some. But the book explains everything and most can be made at home if your handy.
Kind of like a big kids jigsaw puzzle

I have for sale a ~1955 J.C. Higgins Model No. 31 .22 Rifle. This is a great rifle, however after loaning it to a friend, who ""cleaned"" it afterward, it no longer cycles right. (It is a Semi Auto w/under barrel tube mag) So before shooting it, you will need to have it checked out, possibly fixed & inspected by a gunsmith. It does have a small piece on the stock that broke off and was glued (before I bought it) but unless your looking closely at it, it's not too noticeable (Great for Decoration) Or could fix up & use, or could part it out.

***Being sold ASIS & To be 100% Honest & Clear, My friend attempted to clean the internals & did something, so now it will not cycle properly between rounds; semi automatic. Also has chip on top of stock that was glued back on sometime before I purchased it. I never had any problems, but I am not selling this as a working firearm, I am selling it for parts or
repair/non currently fireable, so I am not liable for what you do with it after the sale.***

This really is a great rifle! One of my favorite .22's, but I'm no gunsmith, and I'd like to see what I can get in trade for her.

Will trade it for working .22 rifle, .762x39mm SKS Ammo, hipoint handgun, or? make me an offer!

Chip (Repaired before I purchased; was like that when I got it)

***Required to Purchase***
Must be 18 Years Old or Older; If you look near 18ish, you will need to show me your ID that proves your 18+

Must have current WA Drivers License or WA ID & Have no Felonies and be able to own a rifle in Washington State"

Got a DPMS AR-15.  Only about two months old, bought brand new and has about 150 rounds through it.  It's a great gun, gets great groups but I'm a gun whore so I'm looking to trade up or sell.


Gun comes with the following. 

DPMS AR-15
2 stock steel mags
2 pmags
50 rounds of hornady ammo
CAA grip with 3 back and 3 front grips
UTG quadrail handguard
UTG red/green dot scope
Blackhawks sling
Original case, paperwork, cleaning tools and Patch


Looking for 2 for 1s out of this.  Aks, 1911s, 357s, mini14s and things of that nature.  


No bolt actions, hunting rifles, 22s or any other thing that falls into that category.  Will have pics up soon.  Can throw in a few more rounds of ammo or another gun for the right deals.  Make an offer though.  Worst I could say is no."

First, what I've got to trade:

Spike's Tactical 5.56mm AR15 with 16"" M4 barrel and carbine-length gas system.  This carbine is in great shape, only about 500 rounds down the pipe.  Weapon features a number of quality parts, including a VLTOR modstock, buffer tube, and buttpad, Spike's ST-T2 buffer, Magpul MOE grip, Magpul MOE trigger guard, Spike's free-floating rail system, Spike's aluminum vertical foregrip, Magpul MBUS backup sights, Magpul BAD lever, and a Spike's fake can.  A2 flash-hider included also.  EOTECH 512 may or may not come with the gun, depending on the trade.  As presently set up, this gun is a beast in CQB-type applications, and is a tack-driver well beyond the effective range of the EOTECH.





Second, I've got a Glock 19 up for trade.  The G19 also has around 500 rounds through it.  Perfect shape, comes with 2 factory 15-round mags, factory hard case, and factory magloader.  The G19 has tritium night sights installed, otherwise it is bone-stock.  This is a quality Glock....needs nothing.



Now, on to what I am looking for in trade:

For both weapons, I'd like to get a handgun from the list below PLUS an SBR/pistol AR upper in 5.56mm (no longer than 10.5"" barrel).  Alternatively, I'd be happy with one of the handguns below PLUS a tactical shotgun (Scatterguns/Wilson, Benelli, FN SLP etc.).  Lastly, I'd be glad to trade the AR15 alone for a FN PS90.

Here's the above-mentioned handgun list:
FN FiveseveN
HK USP 45 Tactical

I'm open to entertaining offers outside of the above, worst I can do is politely decline."
