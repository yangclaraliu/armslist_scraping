2,http://www.armslist.com/posts/512002,For Sale:  TriStar TSA Camo 12-gauge shotgun.,"GEORGIA, Georgia, United States",$ 600,"Listed On: Sunday, August 12, 2012",Shotguns,Mossberg                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,no type,Shotgun,"It passed with flying colors, proving itself the equal to or better than shotguns costing three times as much. Now, TriStar has introduced this new camo model that has a three and one-half inch chamber, built to function with any and all twelve gauge shotgun shells, from the lightest target loads to the big 3 ½ inch magnum. To be more precise, the TriStar instruction manual specifies that the 3 ½ inch shotgun can shoot heavy 2 ¾ inch, 3 inch, and 3 ½ inch shells, but I found that this gun functions well with even the light Remington SPS Light Target loads as well. While on the subject of the owner’s manual, the test gun did not have one in the box. 3 ½ inch gas gun, the TriStar is pretty light weight, weighing in at only seven pounds, six ounces on my scale. This is with the twenty-eight inch barrel. The barrel wears a ventilated rib, and has a fiber optic front bead. The top of the receiver is grooved for the mounting of an optical sight. I suggest one that is not too heavy, to prevent movement of the sight under the recoil of the heavy magnum shells. The stock is very well designed, with a full pistol grip, much like those on a sporting clays shotgun. It provides a good hold for controlling the gun under recoil,Am not interested in any forms of trade and will ship to an FFL dealer"

Competition features include extended controls for quicker, easier operation, adjustable target sights, and a barrel weight for reduced muzzle rise and faster follow shots. The barrel measures 5-1/2"" in length. Overall

The firm sold all tooling and parts to Deutsche Werke AG, who continued to make the pistols until the mid 1940s. Well made pistol and of excellent appearance, it was characterized by an unusual self-locking grip safety. Many exported to U.S. in the 1920s through 1940s.

I believe this is one of the earlier, European models for various reasons. It has the lighter colored stock, a metal bolt retracting lever, a non-blued safety switch, and most noticeably no flash suppressor. 


The condition of the stock is Fair with minor scratching, the largest of them being approximately two inches long and an eighth of an inch wide. I should note that at some point in its lifetime the knurling was filled in with some kind of clear varnish. I suspect that with the proper application of refinishing techniques that this could be removed and the stock restored to its original quality. I also suspect that the main scratch may only be varnish deep. There are also non-swiveling sling mounts installed.



The condition of the bluing is Fair, with some spots missing on the barrel and some very light scratching and wear on the receiver, especially near the scope mount area. 




The internals are in excellent condition as well as the inside of the barrel. They are also fully functional. Felt recoil was minimal and accuracy is not an issue.

Email me for a link to more pics. I will also be listing a HK 630 and a HK 300.

The price of $1,650 is FIRM. I will consider trades and $ + trades.
Shipping will be around $30 depending on what my FFL charges me. 
The rifle will be sold with 1: 3 round magazine. 
An additional 10 round magazine is available for an added $200. 
A HK05 quick detach scope mount is also available without rings for $400 or with 1"" rings for $500. 

I WILL ONLY SHIP TO A FFL FROM MY FFL.

516,http://www.armslist.com/posts/512516,For Sale/Trade:  2003 Ford Focus ZX5,"Brookston/Delphi, Lafayette, Indiana","$ 4,800","Listed On: Sunday, August 12, 2012",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is my 2003 Ford Focus ZX5. My parents bought it new in 2003 and I bought it from them when I moved to Indiana from Ohio. I have a clean Indiana title in my name.

My grandmother passed away about a year ago, about 3 months before my daughter was born. We found out over the winter that she'd left her car to us for our growing family, so the Focus has been driven very minimally since November of last year.

For almost 10 years old, it's in pretty good shape, but it IS close to 10 years old - there are a few dents and dings, a scrape on the driver's side front bumper, and a little rust near the wheel wells (see pics for details). While the car was parked it was hooked to a battery tender, and the tires are in good shape with plenty of life on them. It's got a lot of nice features - power windows and locks, cruise control, a moonroof, fog lights, a 6-CD changer, keyless entry fobs, and fold-down rear seats that will let you pack the car FULL of stuff.

There are two issues that I know about on the car. First, the valve cover gasket has a leak. Normally you'd just have a drip on your driveway, but depending on how you park it can drip on the exhaust pipe, giving you a burning oil smell until it cooks off. Here's a writeup on the repair - http://www.focushacks.com/mod/Zetec_Valve_Cover_Gasket_Replacement
The other issue is the adjustable end link. I had one go loose on me and I replaced it myself in an afternoon in the garage, but the other is original. It's probably only a matter of time until the original goes loose. Again, not a difficult replacement. Since it hasn't been used much recently, you'd probably want to give it a once-over and change the fluids and stuff.

The car has been great - it's carried my stuff for years, but I've got a little bit more of a sentimental attachment to the one my grandparents left us - I'd like to pass this one to a good home where it'll be appreciated.

I'm looking for $4800 - if you're looking to defray some cost, I may be interested in a UTV/Golf Cart or Military or Law Enforcement Collectibles (Send Pics!) and can negotiate some if we're trading. I'm available 8a-8p if you'd like to take a look.

Here's a bunch of photos of the car - https://picasaweb.google.com/REDACTEDREDACTED8/DropBox?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCLf0-IiK9ajcEQ&feat=directlink
