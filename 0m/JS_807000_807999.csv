The new ones have metal injection molded (MIM) triggers and hammers.  It also has the new warning label that is under the barrel rather than the old, ugly version on the side.  I thought the extra weight and sight radius of a steel 3"" would be beneficial, but it is much to heavy to carry in the pocket.  My preferred trade would be a s&w 342 m&p or PD model.

It took me awhile to put this package together based on cost of ammo alone. appx 400rds are professional reloads that are to be sold for components only. about 125 of them are loaded for the redhawk specifically and will likely destroy any other weaker framed pistol. it is against federal law to sell reloaded ammo by a person not licensed and I am NOT LICENSED so you will agree to pull them if you purchase and use the components yourself or no deal.

500rds 240gr JHP 
44rds magtech 240gr
14rds 300gr ""bear loads"" from bitterroot valley (factory ammo)
37gr 180 UMC soft point

below are reloads:
111rds 265gr elmer keith
159rds 300gr 
41rds 240gr SWC
81rds 320gr (redhawk only)
6rds 355gr (redhawk only)
10rds 240gr

also included are 2 speed loaders and a nylon shoulder rig I bought from a local company at the WAC show.

Unknown round count total but I've put about 120 through it. Shoots great and is an awesome gun. I just need to finish a couple AR projects or add an AK to the mix as I don't have one.

That said trades are fairly limited. Better deal it is for me, the more I am open to other items. 
Things I'm actively looking for:

AR pistol lower. (need a rifle lower too but pistol is higher priority)
reloading components. .224 projectiles, powder, primers, 9mm 147gr projectiles, 357mag/38spl, 308. kinda picky on powders and if it's not factory sealed I dont want anything to do with it unless its wc844.

Bolt action .22 with threaded barrel (no threaded bbl - not interested)
keltec sub2000 in 9mm glock or beretta variation
92fs pistol w/ mags
147gr 9mm ammo
7.62x39/51 ammo. if you want $.60/rd for x39 ammo please don't bother.
Ak47. prefer an AMD65 but will consider anything else. I do not need high end and will NOT pay accordingly for one. I also am not going to give you $1200 for a friggin WASR unless this package is worth $2200 so please be real.
AR15. very open here. Not adding cash on top so will consider anything.
DECENT medium range scope with rings. Leupold VXI / II would suffice just fine. anywhere from 2 base power up to 14 top end. NOTHING high end here. Just enough to hold zero.
Glock 17 magazines
Glock 34 threaded barrel
Uzi 9mm w/ mags

Everything above is close to an equal desire other than the reloading components and AR being highest and the 92fs being lowest. the rest are all equal. My trade value is $1250 range at PRE CRAZE PRICES. If you want to tell me your WASR is worth $1,000 than we'll adjust to post craze prices because no way is that in a reality I want to live in. cash price is $1500obo only because I'm not looking for cash really. Trades heavily preferred.

Or what else do you have? No shotguns or hunting rifles. Nothing in calibers other than .22lr, 9mm, 45acp, 38spl, 357, .223, 7.62x39, or 308. If it's not in one of those calibers I promise I don't want it."

Don't wake up to a new Executive Order and regret not buying mags while you can!!

10 Lancer L5 translucent polymer mags with steel feed lips.  8 are gen. A1, 2 are gen A2 (bottom right two are A2, they are all physically the same).

Lancer's are considered superior by most to pmags because of the steel feed lips.  Meet/exceed military drop tests and for durability.  If you are not familiar with the brand, please feel free to research.  You will find these are high quality magazines.

These are lightly used.  All are 100% functional, drop free, and still really really stiff in the spring.  I still have the packaging/labels for all of them and can provide them if requested.

Price is very firm at $50 each, $500 for the lot.  Prefer to sell in lots of at least 5 for $250 so I'm not driving all over the metro area to do business.  

At sale, I will test currency with currency testing pen.  We will meet in an area that is compliant and respects the law with Denver local ordinances on mag capacity.  

My camera sucks, sorry for the pic quality.

Its is a great gun in excellent condition that I enjoy shooting, however,  I only really use it for a range gun as its too big to be a practical carry gun. 

The gun is in excellent condition and appears to be almost new cosmetically.  This is a cosmetic AND mechanical clone of the Hi Power, not just a cosmetic clone as some of the other FEG Hi Powers and other clones are that are out there on the market.  However it has had that pesky magazine disconnect safety removed so it has a very light and crisp single action trigger pull.  Comes with three magazines, one factory, the stainless one is a Browning mag, and I am unsure of the third's make but they all load and feed reliably.  The only thing I can say against it is that it could use a different set of grips.  They are Pachmayr's that feel great, but there is too much material on the inside to allow the magazines to come in and out.  I shimmed it in the back to give it some extra space to allow the magazines to be loaded and unloaded and it shoots great as is, it just looks kinda tacky.  Since its just a range gun for me it hasnt been a priority to get a different set.

I am wanting to TRADE ONLY for a compact or subcompact sized semi auto that would be more suitable for concealed carry.  I already have a revolver so not interested in another.  Would like something in 9mm, but may consider .45's or .40's, not interested in .380's though.  I would really like to trade for  a Rock Island compact 1911 (or similar).  Would also consider just about any other subcompact out there such as the subcompact models of the XD, SR9c, SR40c, M&P, PX4, or possibly a cougar or glock.  Would trade for a P64 or CZ82 plus cash or ammo.  Let me know, I'm pretty open to choices, but I prefer something with an external hammer that can be fired single action.

For Sale: Kel-Tec PLR 16 Gas Piston AR Pistol 

Kel-Tec PLR-16 AR Pistol. Gas piston driven with aftermarket Tridium front sight, A2 flash hider, quadrail type forend and single point sling attachment on rear. Accepts AR15 magazines. I’d estimate less than 500 rounds thru it. I bought it and just don’t take it out.

Also includes the factory Kel-Tec 10-round magazine, a black nylon single point sling, a Hogue slip-on grip sleeve, a Leapers/UTG red dot scope and a Bulldog nylon case.

Here is the description of the pistol from the Kel-Tec website:

The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal Silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

*****Per the Kel-Tec website this AR pistol is chambered for .223 Remington***** It makes no mention of being able to use 5.56 ammunition so the buyer needs to be aware of using .223 ONLY. Also the buyer needs to be aware that this is considered a pistol and not a rifle. The use of a vertical foregrip changes the designation of the firearm and must be approved by the Feds. Check regulations before adding any type of foregrip to this firearm.

$750.

Hoping to have photos on Monday but for now here is a link to the KT website:

 http://www.keltecweapons.com/our-guns/pistols/plr-16/

Keep in mind that this photo link does not show the quadrail fore-end, the Hogue grip, the red-dot sight or the sling.

Not really looking for any trades at this time so need to go for an outright cash sale. I’m located in Elizabethtown.

Thanks for looking."

 USP's are smaller and lighter than the larger frame USP - SCOM. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP uses a full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting  magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
 Like their large frame predecessors, USP's are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P+ loads full time .
 To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP , the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. 
Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.
 Features & System Characteristics:
 Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
 Grooved target triggers
 Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life. 200,000 rounds design tested.
 Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
 Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
 Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide
 One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
 No snag, bobbed hammer
 Flared recurve trigger guard
 Choice of flat and extended floorplate on 10- round magazines
 Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
 Ambidextrous magazine release lever
 Contoured, extended slide release
 Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator
 Patented Lock-Out Safety device

Barrel/frame/cylinder are nickel and trigger guard blued.  Finish rates NRA grade ""Excellent"" (80-100% original finish).  

Metal finish is uniformly smooth with no rust-through; only about five pinhead-sized spots of oxidation.  There is some holster-related wear on the sides of the muzzle measuring only about one-eighth inch.  

Wooden grips rate near NRA grade ""Excellent"" with sharp checkering and just a few handling marks on the bottoms.  

Top of barrel rib has two lines:  1) Farrington & Richardson Arms Company - and - 2) Worchester Mass USA  Pat Oct 4 '87 Apr 2 '95 Apr 7 '96.  Markings are exceptionally clear.  

I fired ten rounds of special .32 caliber ammunition without issue.  Advance, timing, and lock-up were adequate ... and better than most revolvers of this vintage that I've owned or seen.   This is an antique and dates to black powder days, but the bore is clean and has solid lands and grooves.  

Modern .32 S&W ammunition is readily available, especially from online retailers, but the ammunition I used had been custom-made for me using non-corrosive propellant and modern primers but loaded to the pressure and standards of the 19th Century black powder rounds for which the gun was designed.  If you want to fire the gun and shop for ""store-bought"" ammunition, ask first whether it is safe for black powder-era weapons.  

I'm not a dealer; just a collector seeking to sell some of my items to take my collection in another direction.  As an antique, this gun does not need to be sold through an FFL.   I will need proof of age and identify, such as a copy of your drivers license.  I'll include a copy of my Curio and Relic (FFL [03]) license when I ship the gun.

Pretty specific gun/light combo to fit this holster.

I used a Sig P226 Combat 9mm with TLR-1 light, but should fit all p226 with rails and TLR-1.  No longer have gun, no longer need holster.  It is owb with the pancake attachments, also including the standard belt loop attachments you can switch in if you like.  

Typical scuffing on the inside but externally pristine, but it's a Raven, and that brand means quality.

These run $90 new and take about 4 damn months to get to you.  
Price is firm at $50

At the sale, I test your currency with a currency testing pen.

The rifle has been owned by me since it was bought new and I had it professionally converted. The rifle has some beautiful ""Russian Red"" wood stocks on it. The stock set alone was made and shipped from Ironwood Designs and cost me over $120 to have it done up the way that I have. The rifle was also fully DuraCoated to a Matte Black once the conversion was completed to give it the nice look that it has. My AK-47 has no marks or blemishes anywhere on the rifle except for the obvious ""AK-47 Safety Scar"" that ALL AK-47s will have. The rifle is beautiful and much more beautiful in person. Only Non-Corrosive ammunition has been shot through this rifle. I've put about 200 rounds or so through the rifle. This AK-47 was much more of a safety queen than my Colt 1911 is. I will sell this rifle with all of the items that I have for it. I'll list them below. 

*NOTE*
I will not accept any less considering that I am seeing WASR AK-47s going for over $1,100 with no accessories. This is a RUSSIAN MADE AK-47 produced in the same plants that all of the Russian military AK-47s are produced. 

EXTRAS:

-360 Rounds of RUSSIAN MADE 7.62x39 ammunition. (Non-Corrosive)
-20  Rounds of American Eagle ammunition. (Great quality hunting ammunition)
-9 Steel Magazines. (30 Rounders)
-2 Clear Magazines. (30 Rounders, very cool looking when ammunition is loaded)
-1 Izzy Bakelite Magazine. (Normally run about $95+ for just ONE of these)
-5 Magazines (5 Rounders, ideal for hunting)

I will entertain trades of multiple handguns with cash, or a straight cash deal. I will not accept a trade that has less than at least $700 cash with whatever else you are offering. I am trying to purchase a motorcycle and I need at least $700 in cash so that I can get one. Like I said, I feel that my value for everything is really good considering that most are asking $1,100+ for a WASR that comes with nothing, this is a Russian made AK-47, the prices of ammunition and magazines have gone up, and the condition of this rifle is near immaculate."

Chamber both 2 3/4 inch and 3-inch 12-gauge shotshells with ease—from target loads, to non-toxic magnum loads, to the latest sabot slug ammo. I have shot about 15 rounds threw it to cycle it and clean it from new. I've also put GG&G sling attachments front and rear. There's also a magpul multi mission sling but that would have to be discussed for a higher price.

Basically these were made for Blackwater Security. They are no longer in production and hard to come by. Only way to own one now is IF the owners of them now were willing to sell them. 

You can still purchase the standard 930 SPX for around $865-$1000. But the Blackwater Tactical Edition is hard to come by, it's basically wanted because of the name. So it tends to draw more attention and highly sought after."

The CZ 452 actions are manufactured from steel billets, not tubing or plastic, and the barrels are hammer forged for accuracy and long life. The trigger is adjustable for weight, and the safety is located above the rear of the bolt and provides a positive firing pin block. Single shot adapters, 5 rd magazines and 10 rd magazines are available for this line of rimfire rifles.""

Mine comes with 4 ten round magazines ($30 each), a 5 round magazine,  carrying case, all manuals, etc.

Please have a current Minnesota Drivers Licence and a permit to purchase/carry card (I know, not required, but for me it is. thanks)."

NEW YORK FIREARMS BAN!

SCOPE is sending this Alert to put all firearm owners on notice that the time to act is now. New York State has positioned itself to pass the most draconian gun laws in the nation. Governor Cuomo is pressing hard to push these bills through. Without a majority in the State Senate to block these measures; their passage is a very real possibility.

We are asking all members to forward all SCOPE communications to concerned citizens on their contact lists and ask them to contact their legislators. Time is short and the consequences of inaction are unacceptable.

These bills, with the Governor pushing for confiscation or a permit system for Modern Sporting Rifles, represent the biggest threats we have faced since 1968. You cannot relax if you do not own one of these rifles because they will divide and separate. Your firearms are next of their list if they succeed here.

SCOPE’S leadership, while representing thousands of firearm owners through individual memberships and clubs, cannot fight this battle alone. This is your call to action. Your participation is no guarantee that we will win this important fight to protect your Constitutional rights but we can say with certainty that anything short of overwhelming our legislators with calls, emails and letters we have virtually no chance. Truth is the only thing that really motivates most legislators is their next election and by contacting your legislators and letting them know that your vote depends on their support is crucial.

We are doing everything within our power to defend your rights, but remember we are an all-volunteer group and we need you to join us in these efforts.

Here is the ACTION PLAN

Forward this to your friends contacts and associates. Spread the word on Forums like NY Firearms with 6600 members or USA Carry with 45000 members or AR15.com with their 11,000 members etc Share on Face book etc. Pass this to at least 10 people that you know and plan to make some phone calls on Monday and Tuesday!

The Governors State of the State Speech planned for Wednesday January 9 at 1:30 PM.

Gun Owners, their families, friends and supporters of the Constitution need to invest a few minutes of their time and make some phone calls.

On Monday and/or Tuesday of this week, prior to the State of the State Address,
Call the Governor’s Office REDACTED– AND LEAVE THIS MESSAGE:

""I am a law abiding, tax paying, voting, citizen of New York State and I strongly urge you not to impose any further restrictions, laws or regulations on my Second Amendment Rights as granted by the United States Constitution"".

Then you call Senate Leader Skelos and Klein and leave the same message.

Then you call Assembly Leader Silver and leave the same message.

Please make these phone call messages to our ELECTED representatives. If the trunk lines into the capital become overloaded with call volume then so be it......this is the goal. WE MUST BE HEARD.
While waiting, you can also access their respective web sites and voice your concern through email message. Write the same message as above or add your own but be civil.

All phone numbers and links are listed below.

You should also forward this to every gun owner you know. Make them call too! Notify you clubs and organizations.

WE MUST STAND TOGETHER!

Read this article so you can understand what the power structure is this term.
Call these IDC members which include: Senators Diane Savino, David Valesky, David Carlucci, and Malcolm Smith. Jeff Klein is in the lead. He's working with Skelos as co-majority leader of sorts. These five along with our Republican friends are gun owners only hope.

Remember that the first phoney AWB we currently have was Introduced, Voted for and Signed in ONE DAY!

Three Anti Gun Protesters stood in the cold outside of the Gander Mountain Store in Henrietta.

We are asking you to make calls - email your reps and spread the word from the comfort of your own soon to be defenseless home.

Shooters Committe on Political Education

A New York State Not For Profit Volunteer Organization dedicated to the preservation of the Second Amendment Rights for New York Citizens.

NEW YORK FIREARMS BAN!

SCOPE is sending this Alert to put all firearm owners on notice that the time to act is now.  New York State has positioned itself to pass the most draconian gun laws in the nation.  Governor Cuomo is pressing hard to push these bills through. Without a majority in the State Senate to block these measures; their passage is a very real possibility.  
We are asking all members to forward all SCOPE communications to concerned citizens on their contact lists and ask them to contact their legislators.  Time is short and the consequences of inaction are unacceptable.  
These bills, with the Governor pushing for confiscation or a permit system for Modern Sporting Rifles, represent the biggest threats we have faced since 1968.  You cannot relax if you do not own one of these rifles because they will divide and separate.  Your firearms are next of their list if they succeed here.
SCOPE’S leadership, while representing thousands of firearm owners through individual memberships and clubs, cannot fight this battle alone.  This is your call to action.  Your participation is no guarantee that we will win this important fight to protect your Constitutional rights but we can say with certainty that anything short of overwhelming our legislators with calls, emails and letters we have virtually no chance.  Truth is the only thing that really motivates most legislators is their next election and by contacting your legislators and letting them know that your vote depends on their support is crucial.       
We are doing everything within our power to defend your rights, but remember we are an all-volunteer group and we need you to join us in these efforts. 

Here is the ACTION PLAN

Forward this to your friends contacts and associates. Spread the word on Forums like NY Firearms with 6600 members or USA Carry with 45000 members or AR15.com with their 11,000 members etc Share on Face book etc. Pass this to at least 10 people that you know and plan to make some phone calls on Monday and Tuesday!

The Governors State of the State Speech planned for Wednesday January 9 at 1:30 PM. 
Gun Owners, their families, friends and supporters of the Constitution need to invest a few minutes of their time and make some phone calls.

On Monday and/or Tuesday of this week, prior to the State of the State Address,
Call the Governor’s Office REDACTED– AND LEAVE THIS MESSAGE:

""I am a law abiding, tax paying, voting, citizen of New York State and I strongly urge you not to impose any further restrictions, laws or regulations on my Second Amendment Rights as granted by the United States Constitution"".

Then you call Senate Leader Skelos and Klein and leave the same message. 
Then you call Assembly Leader Silver and leave the same message. 
Please make these phone call messages to our ELECTED representatives. If the trunk lines into the capital become overloaded with call volume then so be it......this is the goal. WE MUST BE HEARD. 

While waiting, you can also access their respective web sites and voice your concern through email message. Write the same message as above or add your own but be civil.

All phone numbers and links are listed below.

I bought this car 9+ years ago and put 210,000 miles on it.  It has been a VERY reliable car for me with NO major engine or transmission problems.  I was driving this car 650 miles a week until the end of December and wouldn’t hesitate to drive this car anywhere.  I intended on getting 300,000+ miles out of it but ran across a great deal on another car.  I have tried to honestly/ accurately summarize the car below, please read carefully and contact me with any questions.  This Saturn would make a great work car, new driver’s vehicle, inexpensive winter car, etc.
Options and features are:
1.9L DOHC engine; still has good power and averages 31-33mpg highway but uses some oil (very common in these engines).  Had timing chain, water pump, serpentine belt and tensioner (preventative and not due to failure) all replaced this past summer.
 4 speed automatic transmission shifts well, fluid and filter changed about 4 months ago.
Tires are great quality Dunlop Signatures, 60,000-mile-tire in very good condition and are less than a year old.
4 wheel ABS and traction control system work well 
Front brakes were just redone with new pads and rotors less than 2 months ago (Nov 2012).  Rear brake pads were replaced about 3 years ago.
Battery was replaced 1.5 years ago
Radio w/CD player works
Power windows/locks and passengers side mirror, tilt wheel, and driver’s seat has manual lumbar and height adjustments.  Power window on driver’s side rear does not work but can be replaced for about $30.
Heating system works well and has rear passenger floor vents.  Air conditioning worked until last summer but holds refrigerant pressure. It might just need a drain and recharge but I am unsure.
Front and rear bumpers in body paint color, rear spoiler and alloy wheels
Rear 60/40 folding seats for added trunk/cargo room
Rear window defrost works
Nearly new (might have been used once, don’t remember) spare tire and jack
Haynes Saturn repair manual included

**A few minor negatives**:
Driver’s side panels have minor sideswipe damage. The damage has NO effect on driving or operation of doors and is strictly cosmetic!  The beauty of Saturn’s plastic panels, they flex and resist dents.
Power moon roof leaked and was disabled. The interior headliner has some water damage as a result. The moon roof  was caulked in place with silicone."

NEW YORK FIREARMS BAN!

SCOPE is sending this Alert to put all firearm owners on notice that the time to act is now.  New York State has positioned itself to pass the most draconian gun laws in the nation.  Governor Cuomo is pressing hard to push these bills through. Without a majority in the State Senate to block these measures; their passage is a very real possibility.  
We are asking all members to forward all SCOPE communications to concerned citizens on their contact lists and ask them to contact their legislators.  Time is short and the consequences of inaction are unacceptable.  
These bills, with the Governor pushing for confiscation or a permit system for Modern Sporting Rifles, represent the biggest threats we have faced since 1968.  You cannot relax if you do not own one of these rifles because they will divide and separate.  Your firearms are next of their list if they succeed here.
SCOPE’S leadership, while representing thousands of firearm owners through individual memberships and clubs, cannot fight this battle alone.  This is your call to action.  Your participation is no guarantee that we will win this important fight to protect your Constitutional rights but we can say with certainty that anything short of overwhelming our legislators with calls, emails and letters we have virtually no chance.  Truth is the only thing that really motivates most legislators is their next election and by contacting your legislators and letting them know that your vote depends on their support is crucial.       
We are doing everything within our power to defend your rights, but remember we are an all-volunteer group and we need you to join us in these efforts. 

Here is the ACTION PLAN

Forward this to your friends contacts and associates. Spread the word on Forums like NY Firearms with 6600 members or USA Carry with 45000 members or AR15.com with their 11,000 members etc Share on Face book etc. Pass this to at least 10 people that you know and plan to make some phone calls on Monday and Tuesday!

The Governors State of the State Speech planned for Wednesday January 9 at 1:30 PM. 
Gun Owners, their families, friends and supporters of the Constitution need to invest a few minutes of their time and make some phone calls.

On Monday and/or Tuesday of this week, prior to the State of the State Address,
Call the Governor’s Office (518) 474-8390– AND LEAVE THIS MESSAGE:

""I am a law abiding, tax paying, voting, citizen of New York State and I strongly urge you not to impose any further restrictions, laws or regulations on my Second Amendment Rights as granted by the United States Constitution"".

Then you call Senate Leader Skelos and Klein and leave the same message. 
Then you call Assembly Leader Silver and leave the same message. 
Please make these phone call messages to our ELECTED representatives. If the trunk lines into the capital become overloaded with call volume then so be it......this is the goal. WE MUST BE HEARD. 

While waiting, you can also access their respective web sites and voice your concern through email message. Write the same message as above or add your own but be civil.

All phone numbers and links are listed below.

The rifle has been owned by me since it was bought new and I had it professionally converted. The rifle has some beautiful ""Russian Red"" wood stocks on it. The stock set alone was made and shipped from Ironwood Designs and cost me over $120 to have it done up the way that I have. The rifle was also fully DuraCoated to a Matte Black once the conversion was completed to give it the nice look that it has. My AK-47 has no marks or blemishes anywhere on the rifle except for the obvious ""AK-47 Safety Scar"" that ALL AK-47s will have. The rifle is beautiful and much more beautiful in person. Only Non-Corrosive ammunition has been shot through this rifle. I've put about 200 rounds or so through the rifle. This AK-47 was much more of a safety queen than my Colt 1911 is. I will sell this rifle with all of the items that I have for it. I'll list them below. 

*NOTE*
I will not accept any less considering that I am seeing WASR AK-47s going for over $1,100 with no accessories. This is a RUSSIAN MADE AK-47 produced in the same plants that all of the Russian military AK-47s are produced. 

EXTRAS:

-360 Rounds of RUSSIAN MADE 7.62x39 ammunition. (Non-Corrosive)
-20 Rounds of American Eagle ammunition. (Great quality hunting ammunition)
-9 Steel Magazines. (30 Rounders)
-2 Clear Magazines. (30 Rounders, very cool looking when ammunition is loaded)
-1 Izzy Bakelite Magazine. (Normally run about $95+ for just ONE of these)
-5 Magazines (5 Rounders, ideal for hunting)

I will entertain trades of multiple handguns with cash, or a straight cash deal. I will not accept a trade that has less than at least $1000 cash with whatever else you are offering. I am trying to purchase a motorcycle and I need at least $1000 in cash so that I can get one. Like I said, I feel that my value for everything is really good considering that most are asking $1,100+ for a WASR that comes with nothing, this is a Russian made AK-47, the prices of ammunition and magazines have gone up, and the condition of this rifle is near immaculate."
