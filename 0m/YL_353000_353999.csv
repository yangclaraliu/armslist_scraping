This gun was purchased less than a month ago brand new and has only had 20rnds fired through it.  Overall, excellent functioning gun, I am selling it because I have two ARs and am going to replace this one with an optic for the other.  The rifle retails for close to 1200.00, so this is a nice discount for an essentially brand new AR.  Also, I have managed to get my hands on a colt M16 bolt and carrier group which I have installed in the rifle, these are designed to withstand heavy and rapid firing and will last forever, a nice perk for standard AR pricing.  I will have pictures uploaded later today, but can send them through phone beforehand if desired.  I'm not interested in trades unless it is something very similar in value.  REDACTED"

North Haven, CT    In the world of competitive shooting, the name Jerry Miculek is synonymous with record-breaking success.

A highly-accomplished shooter and five-time USPSA 3-Gun National Championship winner, Miculek depends on his equipment to reliably-deliver when fractions of seconds count.

Now you can shoot the same shotgun that this legendary champion uses as Mossberg proudly announces the JM Pro Series 930 Tactical Class of signature shotguns.

Initial offerings in this series of competition-oriented autoloaders include 10-shot and 9-shot versions with many performance-enhancing features. Further distinguishing this signature series is the “JM Pro Series Tactical Class” logo laser-engraved on the receiver.

The versatile 930 platform features a dual gas-vent operating system which aids in recoil reduction and reduces stress and wear on operating parts. This 12 gauge semi-auto reliably handles 2 ¾ and 3-inch from low-brass target loads to hard-hitting magnum rounds. Standard features include Uni-Line™ stock and receiver design for instinctive eye/rib alignment; stock drop spacer system for customizing fit; drilled and tapped receiver; interchangeable ACCU-CHOKE™ system; durable black synthetic stock and forend; and matte blue metal finishes.

Performance-enhancing features on the JM Pro Series include Mossberg’s extended tactical bolt handle; forend cut to facilitate faster reloads; oversized safety button; orange magazine follower; and protective barrel clamp for the extended mag tube. The 10-Shot Tactical Class has a 24-inch, non-ported, vent rib barrel with standard ACCU-CHOKE Modified tube; red fiber optic front bead sight; extended 9-shot magazine tube; adjustable trigger stop; and anodized receiver with chamfered loading port opening. The 9-Shot Tactical Class version features a 22-inch, non-ported, vent rib barrel with standard ACCU-CHOKE Modified tube; red fiber optic front bead sight; extended 8-shot magazine tube; adjustable trigger stop; and anodized receiver with chamfered loading port opening.

Winning a national championship or setting a world record may not be in the cards for you. Looking like a champion and shooting the same gun that world-renown shooter, Jerry Miculek does is possible with the new Mossberg JM Pro Series 930 Signature Shotguns.

Additions to the gun:

So far the gun has under 100 rounds through it of Federal FMJ and Winchester +P Ranger without a single issue. No failure to feed, no failure to fire, no failure to eject. I've also run full speed mag dumps in attempts to cause a failure and have been surprised to find it run flawlessly through them all. All the modifications were done to the gun BEFORE the testing was run so I didn't get a chance to do a before and after. The gun works flawlessly, I have had no problems with it and even though it may look a little cumbersome for some, I have found that my hand fits very well.

This is a perfect gun for someone looking for a cheap and easy to use alternative to those very expensive and complicated firearms. This will reliably send a bullet downrange at your target with no complications. 

Just as a notice: A gun transfer form WILL be filled and will require you to have a WA State Driver's License or Conceal Carry Permit. I will need a copy of your driver's license or CCP, or both. The transaction will also be happening FEET away from a Police Station if you're local. If not I can find another Police Station nearer to you.

TRP production starts in a similar manner as the Professional. The gunsmith receives a semi-finished, hand-forged National Match frame and slide, and individually cut the rails, drill the pinholes, and fit the slide by hand lapping it to the frame. The result of this attention is a slide to frame fit that has zero vertical or horizontal play. The TRP has a match-grade Springfield barrel that is fitted to a match-grade bushing making the pistol more than capable of providing superb accuracy and reliability. The match grade trigger is aluminum and fitted with an overtravel stop. The trigger pull on my sample broke cleanly at 4.5 pounds with no overtravel. As with the Professional, the TRP features a magazine well extension, checkered front strap, beavertail grip safety, and ambidextrous extended safety. The grips are unique to the TRP line. They are made from a G10 composite with a snakeskin like texture and feature a relief cut on the left panel to improve access to the magazine release."

Taurus 10 + 1 Round 45 ACP Millennium Pro w/3.25"" Barrel/Stainless Finish

Constructed with a hammer forged slide and an injection molded polymer frame, Taurus' Millennium Pro PT145 is a pocket size, extremely lightweight double action only autoloader in .45 ACP that weighs a mere 22.6 ounces. It joins Taurus' family of ultra compact personal defense Millennium autoloaders. The Model PT145 features a 10 round magazine capacity for 10+1 firepower, but the most central feature of the gun is its rugged recoil operated action instead of the simple blowback mechanisms found on many other pocket size pistols.

This gun has been fired.  Has normal cycle marks on chamber of barrel.
 Other than that, it is in ""as new"" condition.  I used the extra
magazines to rotate loaded magazine's.  Always keeping a couple loaded
and the rest empty.  The magazines are perfect as is the gun.  It has
a better trigger than my Glock's.  

Gave it to my son and he wants a different pistol.  Always kept in gun safe with proper humidity.  Has original box, papers,  6 Taurus Mags, and 2 Promag magazines.  Fobus right handed paddle holster, Fobus two mag carrier, and an inside the waistband holster than additionally carries an extra mag.

 Here is where I order most of my firearms through.  I have found them to be very consistent in price.  For the Taurus... http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/32444/Taurus+PT145+Millennium+Pro+45acp+Stainless

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

A favorite among Benelli shotguns, the Benelli Super Black Eagle sets the standard for styling, versatility and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.

The Benelli SuperNova embodies a modular design concept in a pump action shotgun. With the optional SteadyGrip™ stock, this 12-gauge shotgun can be transformed into a high-performance turkey gun or mount a fully-rifled slug barrel for tack-driving accuracy on deer. It’s like having several Benelli shotguns in one. There’s even a barrel with rifle sights for home defense and a SuperNova Tactical fitted with a ghost-ring rear sight and pistol grip.

THE 1911 LOOKS IN A SMALL CALIBER .22LR
The 1911 in .22 caliber connects original design with an innovating concept. On one hand we stuck to existing design and measurements, this means a development with “Mil-Spec” specifications in inches. On the other hand we added additionally the magazine safety, drop safety and firing pin safety to meet present safety standard. Sport shooting without any compromises is assured."

I have an extra magazine with it which was an additional $40 for this gun and it only came with 1 magazine when I purchased it new.

It comes with the the sig case and all the goodies from sig.  This is just as good as buying a new one from an FFL.

CCW holders preferred, you will have to have OH drivers license to purchase this gun from me."
