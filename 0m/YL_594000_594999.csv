The gun is in excellent condition as it has only had about 50 rounds though it and for most of its life has been kept in a climate controlled gun safe.(the only knock on the gun is the Factory Remington Limb Saver Recoil Pad is kind of tacky. I had a gunsmith look at this issue and was assured that this occasionally happens) The gun also includes a Harris Bi-Pod and Leopold Vari-X III 3.5x10 40 mm scope along with half a box of Winchester 150 gr Power Point ammo, a sling, and scope cover.

When I priced this gun and its accessories out online this was what I found

Gun - 680
Scope - 599
Bi-Pod - 85
Scope cover, shells, sling - nominal

So by my calculation this gun brand new would run 1365.00. I was asking 1100.00 for it. But if you feel I am to high please let me know your best offer as I am willing to wiggle a little on the price. If you are solely interested in the gun I would separate the items and sell the gun for 600.00.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Production year is 1948 if I know how to read the standard catalog of S&W.
Barrel is 6"" long (unusual for that model), it holds six, comes with magna grips serialed to the gun, and hasn't yet lost all of its finish.
Gun shows (obvious) signs of regular use and wear: The left side of the gun (as a right handed shooter would carry it) appears to have spent several years rubbing up against someone's gut, and there are a couple of dings near the rear sight (which are milled into the frame: completely fixed and also tiny) and front sight. Front sight has remnants of paint from a previous owner that I haven't bothered attempting to remove. May have been used to pistol whip someone in the 1950s; cannot confirm. 
Timing and lockup are great, the cylinder spins clean, and the hammer strikes primers with authority -- no light strikes here.
I'm not particularly interested in any more guns, but I pretty much always need small pistol primers and (unopened and new manufacture!) kegs of various powders. No Bitcoins, precious metals, prohibited possessors, vinyl record collections, fixer-upper dirt bikes, or out of state third party checks, please."

Selling my Thermal Arc Arcmaster 200 amp ac/dc TIG welder. Bought it so I could sit down and hone my TIG skills but life as it turns out has other plans. I have only used this welder once since I purchased it over 6 months ago, and only for about 20 minutes. The welder was purchased used as a low hour rental from weld specialty supply. I am selling it as a ready to weld package including my brand new full tank of argon, cart, two different plugs ( came with one had to buy another for use at my dads shop), consumables kit, and owners manuals. This unit is fully programmable, can store either 5 or 6 weld programs for quick changes from job to job. Currently it has a heavy duty air cooled torch with thumb switch (Part of the reason I couldn't use it for very long, I prefer the foot pedals). I will include my slip of paper that proves I bought and own the tank, this paper is necessary if you plan to have it filled with weld specialty supply (applies to businesses only, private citizens can not use weld specialty supply). It is an inverter machine so it is small and light weight, easily moved from place to place. I do not really want to sell it but it's at a friends shop, I feel guilty leaving it there and not being able to use it, and as with a lot of people out there I could use the money. I could also be interested in trades or partial trades as I do need or want other things. Cash however is king."

With an overall length and width close to many .380 pocket 

pistols, the full-power 9mm P7M13 has a full-length four-inch barrel enclosed in its low profile steel slide.

The unique HK cocking lever allows the P7M13 to be carried safely with a round in the chamber, yet it is ready to fire by the intentional squeezing of the fingers 

around the grip. Releasing the cocking lever decocks the P7M13 immediately and renders it completely safe.

The P7M13 gas system retards the movement of the recoiling slide during firing and eliminates the need for a conventional locking mechanism or heavy slide. The low 

profile slide contributes to the balanced center of gravity and compact size of the P7M13.

Made of high-grade steel, the low profile slide keeps the recoiling mass as small as possible. Combined with the optimal grip angle of 110°, the result is a compact, 

accurate, and low recoil pistol well suited to civilian and law enforcement users.

• Polygonal rifling for increased barrel life

I've had no problems with it in the approximately 200 rounds through it.  It was even used by Chris Costa at a pistol class this year.

It is a STI 2011 wide-body style pistol in 45acp.  Caspian slide (cut down to length), Nowlin/KKM barrel, and APS (Jim Shanahan) double undercut grip.  It comes with 3 magazines (including a flush basepad for carry, a regular STI one, and a Dawson aluminum one), some extra spare parts (heavier / lighter recoil springs, extra trigger, some extra magazine parts), and a custom holster & mag carrier.  Pistol was built for carry and not competition, so the trigger is heavier than would be on a competition pistol.  Even so, it shoots very nicely, and pretty soft.  Pistol shoots well, but I'm looking to put some more money into my business, so it needs to go.  Comes with everything in the pictures except the ammunition.

The pistol still shoots just a tad high, and needs either a higher front sight (current sight is tritium and only 6 months old) or a lower rear.

Shipping to your FFL is available at buyer's expense.  

I think this is a heck of a bargain for a STI pistol with 3 magazines, the excellent APS grip, and extra parts.  Catch it before it goes on gunbroker."

Go check out the Beretta NEOS...its a real unique gun.Also..both the gun and carbine kit come in their original boxes.

The Commando can be comfortably carried with its 11.5"" barrel, yet be instantly available to provide the type of firepower required to outmatch combatants.

The rifle I have is a Revelation model 100, which is actually a mossberg 321K. It is a really good shooting little rifle, very heavy and solidly built. Has a feed ramp that makes loading cartridges very easy. Shoots 22L, LR, Short. When I bought it I completely went through the rifle. Never had a single issue with it. Rifle is ready to go shooting.

Safety is automatically engaged when the bolt is pulled back. Has very nice iron sights that are adjustable for elevation and windage without drifting. Receiver is grooved to accept a scope. Great rifle for teaching a youngster how to shoot, or just an overall good 22 rifle.

Will include the rifle, a soft case and a sling. Could possibly throw in a 4x32 scope with rings for the right 12ga shotgun. This rifle is ready to go.

Trade for..... 12ga shotgun

Break action or pump action 12ga shotgun. No aluminum receiver models please. Must have a wood stock. Ideally looking for an older winchester 37, older H&R, older savage, or the like. Must be in good working condition with no cracks in the stock.

OR will sell for $135, rifle, sling, case and 4x32 Tasco scope.
OR $120 for rifle, sling and case.
OR $115 for rifle and sling only

Would prefer a trade."

Very nice MTD yard machine riding mower. Here's the list of items I've replaced. Has new deck spindles beginning of mowing season 2012. Just yesterday I replaced the steering arm and ball joints with MTD OEM parts. New belt on deck beginning mowing season 2012. It has the original paint & decals and it's still bright shiny red. This mower has fresh oil every season & is washed off regularly. It was waxed back in the winter months to keep it's shine. Battery is one year old and has no issues firing up this beast. Mower has been taken care of over the years, I'm the original owner. Had a new deck put on it 3 yrs ago by ACE Hardware of Arcadia. I don't need it b/c I just bought a new mower this season. It runs good, mows good, steering is great with no weak areas as I've replaced most all the steering components. Price is Firm! Would also trade it for nice firearms, but no cheap stuff & trade value is $400. Come test drive it & take a look. The mower will need new blades soon, If I buy & put them on, price goes up $75, but you can buy them & put them on for way less than that. (around $40) Here's a video link of the mower that I have taken today 10/3/2012 showing the mower firing up, idling, blades engaging & moving on it's own power. All tires in good shape & hold air year after year. No plugs! Call me/text me/email me. My name is Brad and cell # is: 33six-3zero1-two873. Cant's accept calls during work, but can texts & emails. I work 2nd shift from 2:30pm till 11pm so if you want this clean mower, come see it in the mornings or weekends. Thanks for looking at my ad.

I have for sale or possible trade a nice Sig 228 with the Wilcox Night Stalker setup. This is a US Navy Seals Spec Gun. This sig has the Wilcox/UITC setup installed on it by wilcox. The pistol has an infra-red and visible laser built in the frame of the gun.

THE LIGHT IS CLUNKY AND DONT RECOMMEND LIVE AT FIVE operation with it BUT DOES HAVE VISIABLE LIGHT JUST PART OF THE PACKAGE.

THESE ARE RARE AND IF YOU WANT TO SELL IT LATER DONT SUGGEST YOU SELL THE VISIABLE LIGHT OFF BEING IT IS A MATCHING SET AND IS THE ONLY WAY THEY WERE SOLD AS A PACKAGE INSTALLED BY WILCOX.

This is a very intricate setup. Wilcox builds this setup only for the federal government. The visible laser can be seen by the human eye, just like any other laser for a pistol, the difference is this one works for up to 2000 yards away and it WILL BLIND YOU if you point it in your eye. The pistol also has the Wilcox Infra Red Laser built into the slide. The IR laser WILL BLIND YOU AS WELL.

You have to be extremely careful when handling this weapon as you can LOSE your eye sight from the high intensity lasers. Both the IR and Visible lasers can be set up to blink at 8 different rates.

There are 8 men in each Seal Team, each man trains to his own laser frequency.

They train with visible lasers during the training sessions and IR lasers at night or during operations. Don’t believe that bs you see in movies with Navy Seals using visible lasers in operations. Doing that would give away their position to the enemy and get them killed. They use the IR laser for nigh operations. In order for you to see the IR laser you will need a set of Night Vision goggles.

This is an extremely rare weapon. This is the exact pistol setup Navy Seal Team 6 operators used to shoot Osama Bin Laden in the head, just try find another one of these and you will realize how extremely rare this weapon is. If this setup is good enough to kill Bin Laden, it is good enough to do anything else. This pistol is the real deal.The pistol was built by Wilcox in 1996.

Wikipedia clarifies the differences on the AS variant:
This variant comes closest to a traditional Double-Action/Single-Action trigger with a decocker. In Double-Action mode the internal striker is at rest with no pre-load and the trigger travel is 14 mm (0.55 in) long at approximately 38 N (8.5 lbf) trigger pull. When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon (re)loading, the internal striker is manually pre-cocked to Single-Action mode and the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot and the Anti Stress mode is activated. The trigger travel is 14 mm (0.55 in) long in the Anti Stress mode at approximately 20 N (4.5 lbf) trigger pull. On all subsequent shots, the P99AS is automatically pre-cocked and the trigger travel is reduced to 8 mm (0.3 in) at the same 20 N (4.5 lbf) trigger pull. For manually deactivating the Anti Stress mode and setting the pistol to Double-Action mode the P99AS features a decock key or knob on the slide. The Anti Stress mode can also be manually activated by moving the slide approximately 10 mm (0.4 in) back.[13]"
