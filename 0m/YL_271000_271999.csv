custom built ar-15. alot of time and cash was spent putting this piece together. You cannot find or buy an ar that cycles/runs this well .the last time i was out shooting, after i sighted it in with a bore laser @ 100 yards i squeezed off 15 rounds and all rounds wer inside the diameter of a half dollar @ 100yards. this machine is sergical and deadly accurate.. i have already taken 3 groundhogs all @ 200-250yds,  thats no bull sht..... Since the first set of pics were taken i have added a small/compact bipod with 6-8"" spring loaded rubber coated feet, dual point sling mount/backplate so u can attach your sling to either side of the weapon, a black midway usa single point adjustable tactical mil-style/spec sling. X2 5.56 snap caps for ease of dry firing without stressing the waepon. And a few other things i cannot think of at the moment. I will try to update pics soon...   NEW PICS are UP

A nice scarce Winchester 1894 pre 64 ""flat band"" carbine in caliber 30WCF (30-30), has a 20 inch barrel with original sights and a bright bore. Metal condition is very good. There is a small worn spot on the magazine tube from being carried in a rack (probably). Barrel blue is about 85% and receiver a bit less. Wood is original and good with some scratches, etc. Believe this carbine was made in 1946. Serial number is 14291XX.

If interested, I can provide more photographs.

Why buy a new rifle when you can have old school quality for the same or cheaper price?

Would like to sell to Oregon buyer in a face to face, cash transaction. Might be willing to ship to your FFL (for non-Oregonians) if buyer picks up the shipping.

This sale is for my Saiga 12 shotgun as shown in the pictures. Everything in the pictures come with the gun (Case, (2) 10-round mags, MD20 drum).
This gun is perfect. I purchased this about a year ago brand new from PFI who did all of the conversion work and opening gas ports for cycling the cheap stuff. This will fire Federal bulk birdshot all day long. I still have reciepts from PFI showing the work he did for me which totaled about $1000. 

Other modifications I have done to this are:
Magpul CTR adustable stock
Chaos Titan Quad Rail
Molot GK-01 compensator (Had to order this from Russia. Very expensive, but what a difference!)
RAM extended magazine release
Chaos HK sights
Tromix Extended (large) Charging Handle
AFG angled foregrip
CSS puck
Gunfixers (5 settings) adjustable plug
Hogue pistol grip

This gun has been my favorite gun since I got it, and is a real head turner. When I take it to the range it's a guarantee that I have 2-3 people come up to me asking what this gun is, asking to hold it or take pictures of it. I'm disapointed that I have to sell it, but I need the cash for other things. No issues w/ this gun. It'll shoot slugs, buck, or birdshot all reliably. 
If you're local (chicagoland area) and have cash, I'll be happy to go to the range with you to show you it'll fire anything we feed it. It's impossible to fire this without smiling.
I have between 180-250 rounds through it, almost all of it birdshot. 

I'm asking $1600 for this setup. If local, I'll also throw in the rest of my 12ga ammo (about 150 birdshot, some slugs, and (~50) 00Buck. 
I've saved just about every reciept and manual for all of the extra parts, along with the original parts (except stock) that you can have with the gun if you prefer.

Like new condition and not shot very often. only reason im thinking of selling is that the stock doesn't fit me. LOP is 14 .5"". makes a great home defense gun or if you got a field barrel for it would be a great turkey gun.

more interested in a trade more than cash. interested in browning A5, Remington 870, double barrel shotgun or lever action rifle in 30-30, 357mag or 45lc

in the picture is three guns im willing to trade 2 or all three to balance the value for the right trade.
 the other two guns are a springfield series 67 E 20g 3'' chamber for $150. next is a Thompson Center Hawken .50 cal that has been a wall hanger all its life. $350"

Those serial # were 534000/599000.- ""mine has #'s in that range""
 After the 8 September 1943 armistice between Italy and the Allies, the Germans saddled Beretta with three engineers from Germany. Moreover the factory was garrisoned by the SS... Weapons of that time, even the ones produced for the Germans, bore the punch mark 4UT
(Quarto Ufficio tecnico di Controllo Armi e Munizioni--4th Technnical Control Unit
an C. Still, in Axis Pistols, page 107, states,
""It is likely that almost all of the 4/UT, ...were used by the German Army"". He also includes two other variations in this statement, ""1944 dated and blank slide Model 1935"".
Ugo Menchini, in Pietro Beretta Le Automatiche, regarding an M1934, page 255, states,
""In late 1940 there appears an oval including the punch mark IVU. It refers to the 4th technical Control Unit of the FAG, where inspection was carried out.""
Note that, while they seem to represent the same inspectors, the ""IVU"" is not
the same mark as the ""4UT"". The IVU would be found on the pre RSI model M1934, and the 4UT would be found on the RSI model M1935.
These are the reasons why I believe that it is likely that all of the 4UT Berettas were RSI pistols. 
the IVU and the 4UT were the same office, but under Italian management the IVU, before the surrender of Italy, and German the 4UT, so after september, 8 1943.towards the end of the war approached the finish of these guns was worse, but they worked well equally. 
great bore, crisp action no rust at all on the inside parts,minor rust pitting on one side of slide, half cock feature, perfect grips, lanyard.
great piece of history and a fun shooter."

This would make a great gun for the lake, because of its unique nickel coating, it is highly resistant to rust. I'm the original owner, and I've shot the gun about 50-60 times. 

Not a better shotgun I'd trust my life with. If I didn't have another 870 in the safe, I wouldn't be selling this one. 

I'm letting this gun go in order to get funds for a traditional bow (recurve or longbow). So I'm open to trades in that area, or if you have an interesting gun of lesser value to add with cash, I will entertain offers. 

I'm not in a desperate situation, so don't bother with lowball bids.

Back when everyone thought that the pump action shotgun couldn’t be improved, the Benelli Nova Pump proved otherwise. Completely original and innovative, 12-gauge pump incorporates a polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics make the gun not only pleasing to look at, but a delight to hold and handle. Distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and forend in place of conventional checkering provides a positive gripping surface and complements the innovative engineering of the Nova Pump. With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova 12-gauge shotgun can handle anything from target loads to 3-1/2 magnums. Shown in Black Synthetic the Benelli Nova Pump is the most versatile pump action shotgun ever made."

 This Kimber is in great shape and fires/functions very well. There are a couple of blemishes. One is on the left side of the slide towards the front (looks like holster wear or thin finish), One is behind the trigger and below the slide-stop (probably due to disassembly) and lastly the grip safety show some wear due to being engaged.

I recently was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps, my father has twisted my arm to join him in the Marine Corps League. Part of what they do is honor gaurd for funerals for veterans. I know rifle manual with a black gun, but with the solid M1 Garand I do not, and need to practice with a good M1 Garand. I would like to find an M1 Garand that is in good to great condition but for a reasonable price. Reasonable would be around 1,000. I have been to many gunshows and gunshops around the state and realize that I am looking for a needle in a hay stack. And please if you are going to email me back dont email me with a rifle that you would not consider a nearly blemish free rifle. This is going to be used for funerals for our fellow veterans. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

I have 2 really nice items to trade, your choice. and I can add some other little things like .45 mags, cable locks, Baretta mags

FIRST: Here is a very scarce variant of Taurus's Tracker series of revolvers, the Model 450 chambered in .45 Colt Caliber. Produce code is 2-450021TMC. Frame stamped model number is 1025, opposite the yoke. Matte Spectrum Blue finish is near full strength throughout, with moderate cylinder rotation marking and faint amounts of whitening on the cylinder and muzzle edges. Barrel is full shroud 2 inch ported with 6 vents. Gold inlay to the caliber stamping on the right side of the barrel and the logo on right side plate is somewhat weak. We bought this revolver in early 2008 from a Taurus liquidation. Several specimens from that lot were highly unusual Tauruses, including this one and an 850 variant chambered in .40 S&W. We believe this is a prototype or at least one of only a few that Taurus had on hand and sold early in 2008. Fjiestad's Blue Book indicates that the model was only produced from 1999 until 2002, and there are definitely no more .45 Colt Revolvers in Taurus's offerings for the past three years. This one has its original box with correct label and velvet cut-out insert, appropriate for a Taurus Demo or sample revolver. Note the X suffix to the serial number. This specimen is excellent mechanically; bore, cylinder chambers and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent. It is a lock variant, and comes with two keys for its inconspicuous patented Taurus Hammer Lock. Capacity is 5 rounds of .45 Colt, and weight empty is a Night-Guard rivaling 20 ounces. We're offering this unique Taurus .45 Colt Tracker for only $ 549.95

SECOND:   Here is a Mossberg, Maverick Model 88  ... 12 ga. pump shotgun. It is set up as home defense with pistol grip, it has the waterproof Marine finish on it. with an 18'' barrel. Also included with it is a nice 27'' Skeet Barrel with 2 dots, gold one midway and bright white tip on the end. I have 3 Choke Tubes for the Skeet barrel, a Full, an improved cylinder and a modified. This shotgun has never yet been fired. I also have the full stock so you can convert it for use shooting Skeet or whatever else you desire to hunt with it. I will also toss in a belt type 15 shell holder, wear as a belt or over your shoulder."
