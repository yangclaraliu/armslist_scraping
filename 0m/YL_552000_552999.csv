The barrel is sawed off to 18 1/4 inches, so pretty much the shortest legal length.  I cut the stock down to an ergonomic grip, and wound it tightly and neatly with black 550 cord, feels great.  I removed the pump release for speed and ease of use(still has the safety), and also made a simple reflex sight that worked out great.

Very smooth function, and very clean inside and out.  There are several small scratches that I've blued over some but hey, it's a brutal and efficient defense weapon, not some cute little display toy.  Still you choose the level of force you want... 00 buck, birdshot, or just the sound of it racking in the dark can get rid of a problem.

If you have any questions just call, text, or email me.  Text is most convenient.  I live on Fort Bragg but can meet near a gate if you need.  Thanks,

Last owner told me he bought this about 6 months ago from Hart Bros. Weaponry along with a bunch of extra stuff. He said he fired exactly ten rounds through it, never even sighted it in, and then threw it in the safe. It is in EXCELLENT condition. There is a slight scuff mark on top of receiver above the serial number. Very minor, but want to disclose. Probably would polish off (although frankly there would be no point as it is not deep). There may be other very minor handling marks, but it is about as nice as a ""used"" gun can get. He wanted black rings instead of gray, so he never even used the rings that came with it. I have removed the scope he had on it along with his aftermarket rings to be sold separately. I am including the factory original rings which are still in original factory packaging. There is one magazine inside the gun, and I am including TWO more unopened factory sealed magazines to sweeten the deal. Includes box which matches serial number of gun.  $550 shipped.

Ruger 10/22 Target Tactical  VLEH l$525 SHIPPLED AVAILABLE

Here is a very nice rifle in a hard to find configuration these days. These are such sweet little guns. Do a google search and check the forums to see what guys are saying about them. It has such a solid feel to it. The rubber overmold stock has a nice weight to it, and the target barrel is both aesthetically pleasing and (according to the feedback I have seen), quite accurate.

This was sold to me as unfired. I do not know if it is or not. The guy I bought this from sold me two rifles, he said the other one was fired, so don't know why he would be dishonest about this one. It does have some blemishes and handling marks. I am including a total of THREE magazines with this rifle. I am including the one it came with, and two brand new, factory magazines still in packaging. They sell for 17.95 a piece on Ruger's site. I am also including a tactical gun case made by Bull Dog. This is about a $40 case. Last owner said his buddy had his bolt stop replaced, so when I he bought this one, he had his replaced also. I will include in this sale the original bolt stop, along with a business card of whom I assume was the gunsmith who did the work. This comes with original, matching box, original paperwork and lock, and the bipod seen in the picture. EVERYTHING on this gun is factory (with the exception of the bolt stop). This is NOT an aftermarket stock, it came Hogue from the factory.  $525 Shipped

There are a few other handguns i am looking for but most are rare but a few are listed below.

I have done so much to the Mil-Spec 1911A1 that I'm not sure where to start, Heres a few:
-Skelitonized hammer
-Skelitonized  trigger
-Trigger reset
-Custom comp spring
-Parkerized Mil-Spec Black Grip Style Guide Rod
-Parkerized Mil-Spec Black Recoil Spring Plug
-Modified Black Wooden Grips & the original ones
-Magazine Parkerized Catch
-Enhanced Grip Spring
-(2) Specialized Metal Match Mags
-(1) Chip McCormick X-mag 1911 Magazine
 It has in my opinion the perfect trigger pull, it's got a really amazing how well the trigger job was done to comp Springfield specifications.
Almost everything From top to bottom has been worked on/replaced with superior enhanced parts or modified to make the best 1911 i could make.

I have had all the work done by Springfield custom shop and by professional gunsmiths. I hate getting rid of it but would like something a bit lighter because I'm disabled and can't carry the full weight of a 1911 anymore.

I have less than 300 rounds through it. I know this because when I bought it I also bought 300 rds bulk ammo for her and I still have about 30 rds left in the box.

The entire pistol has been stripped and refinished with Cerakote in Flat OD green and matte black. The original SA finish was peeling off, due to their wet application process. It is now properly baked and finished. The internals have all been polished and adjusted for smooth operation. Trigger has been kept stock on pull, because it was my carry pistol and pretty good out of the box. The ambi safeties have been trimmed down for CC, as shown in the pic. 

Comes with the original Springfield box and 1911 gear, 2 factory 7 rd mags, factory Trijicon night sights, dymondwood thin grips, and oversize bushings. The arched mainspring housing is NOT included in the trade unless you have one already on the gun you are trading. (the original factory metal MS housing with ILS will be re-installed)

There is a TINY bit of wear on the slide at the muzzle from carry, and another tiny mark on the beavertail and safety, all from holstering/unholstering during dry & range practice.

I only want to trade this pistol for a 1911 Government, nothing else. I have no interest in selling it, as I love it just as is. However, I have always wanted a 1911 Gov. I just purchased a new XDS for EDC, so I really could be swayed into going to a full size 1911. 

My terms are:
Your gun for my gun. FTF, no BS, no BOS (unless you want one), CO resident only verified by CCW permit or DL
Your gun is: In near-new condition like this one, is of similar quality and finish, is not beat up, loose, dented, scratched, or otherwise abused. I have just over $1K into this gun with the finishes, so please be realistic as I feel that I am as well.

This is my last project up for sale. I hand-picked the absolute best parts for everything I could find. Nothing was spared for this rifle. It is exceptionally accurate and has been zero'ed for Black Hills 75 gr match (of which I have around 800 rds remaining, available for sale). Some of the pictures show the old Daniel Defense MFR 12.0 rail; the rifle now has the Seekins Precision BAR rail on it (much better for the bipod). Also will come with 4x 20 rd PMags.

The rifle has about 100 rds through it and the stainless barrel was properly (frequently) cleaned and broken in.

The entire rifle was professionally coated with Cerakote by Ryan at FTW. No mismatched upper/lower receivers, rail, grips, etc...the whole gun matches. Perfectly. 200

Please do not lowball or insist that I've overvalued the rifle. It is worth what I've asked; however, logical, rational negotiations will be entertained. 

$3199 for the entire package, or $2199 w/o the optic and mount.

Black Hills Blue Box (75 gr match HP) to be negotiated upon sale of the rifle.

This version has a full 13"" length of pull walnut target/sporter style stock from the factory. This series was made from 1947 until 1969 and are very hard to find in this condition. The bolt works very smoothly and the trigger pull is just right. It fires and functions perfectly and is ALL factory original, including the factory installed Lyman 57RS aperture(peep) sight that is in excellent shape with very positive click adjustments, a patridge style square post front sight, case hardened rear bolt housing, oversized bolt handle and 1907 military sling and swivels. The 25"" barrel has some slight surface corrosion but no pitting anywhere. The bore is in perfect shape and the rifle is extremely accurate and reliable with any .22 short, long or long rifle cartridge just like it was when it was new. The stock has no chips or cracks, but does show some wear considering it's age.  Also included with the rifle is the 6-round magazine, an extra 10-round magazine and an exact reproduction owner's manual. This rifle will make a fantastic collector and/or shooter, all at a great price.

Ruger Mini 14 Tactical.  Bought this spring.  Has less than 100 rounds through it.  Need the cash to fund another project.  Mint condition.  Comes with five 20 round mags (3 are factory Ruger, 2 are Pro Mags), and two 30 round Tapco mags.  I tried all three brands of mags and they all worked flawlessly.  Also comes with Ruger scope rings, Ruger gun lock, and original handbook.  

The newer Mini 14s (like this one) are much more accurate than older models, but still as reliable.  

Not interested in shipping.  I do travel a lot, so I might be able to deliver depending where you live.  Buyer must be from WI and have a valid ID for CCAP.  Cash only, no trades.   Asking $675 obo.  Shoot me an offer. Thanks for looking."

It's been a fine carry piece for a number of years. However, I have that ""one in, one out"" agreement with my wife so this one must go since I bought a Glock 26. I believe this one is from 1976. The Cobra is the aluminum-framed version of the Colt Detective Special. Basically it's an ""airweight-J-frame"" type revolver, but holding 6 rounds instead of 5 rounds. Round count was very obvuiously low when I bought it about 3 years ago, and I've probably put about 250 rounds through it. Runs great, nice and tight, shoots like a dream. The trigger is smooth and quite nice. It's been carried, so there are some superficial scuffs and such, most notably at the muzzle. But, there is no rust or bubbling of the finish. It comes with a simple zippered case, the original wooden Colt grips, some Hogue grips, and a couple of speed strips. I'd like $425 cash for it. NOT interested in any trades at this time and NOT interested in shipping this to your FFL. Located in the Wayzata/Minnetonka area. I'll definitely need to see a current valid MN DL and a P2C at the time of sale."

Can provide pics, great shape/like new.  Not many rounds through it.  Got it sighted in and checked it from year to year, sadly I never used it to take a deer.

  The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment
