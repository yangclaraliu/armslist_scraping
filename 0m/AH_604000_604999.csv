I'm not concerned about the condition of the furniture as the bullpup kit replaces the grip, stock and hand guard pieces, nor does it it matter if the rifle uses folding or fixed stock so long as it's a square-cut receiver (no angle-cut receivers for a thumb-hole stock) with a cleaning rod hole at the lower grip barrel flange.

I would prefer to get one that's free of any defects that would affect performance (i.e. no canting on sights or gas block, no mag wobble, no keyholing).

Paying cash, and am willing to meet in person for a private party transfer pending signed bill of sale and Missouri driver's license (or other proof of Missouri residence).

I'm also open to an FFL transfer for an out-of-state purchase if the price is right and you can work with me on shipping.

Convert your FACTORY STOCK GLOCK* Handgun into a .22 LR. with an Advantage Arms Conversion Kit

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT: Six great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

1. The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK OEM sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation.

2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN

The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3. INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm.

4. FINISH All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot. This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice."

It is a very solid workhorse of a handgun, perfect for small game, snakes and other undesireable creatures one might come across in Hoosierlands woods.  I found this one a short-time ago locally, and bought it on the spot.  Now it is time to pass it on. This gun would be the perfect 'First Handgun'  to teach a young person how to handle a revolver.

I Will consider any trade offers, except shotguns, at this time.  Would also 'bundle' this gun with one of the other two I have listed to make an even trade for what you may have up for barter.

Make an offer, the worst action would be to say no !!  Respond thru the  Armslist service, then we can switch to our own comm-lines if the deal looks good.

P-3AT
The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

 You must be over 21 to own a Silencer. The NFA requires a one time per item *** $200.00 *** tax stamp on each Silencer, Short Barrel Rifle (SBR), .. basically any Class III item. The $200.00 Check or Money order is sent directly to the ATF with your Silencer paperwork. I handle all the paperwork for you. You just hand me the check to send in with the paperwork. Or if your not local I can send paperwork to you by mail. You only need sign a few spots in front of Notary and Drop in the mail with the $200 check made out to the ATF. To start paper work you pay for the Silencer and the Serial# that goes on the paperwork becomes yours. We can handle everything through the mail except the actual pickup of the Silencer. You will have to come to the shop or meet us at a gun show to take delivery after it clears the ATF.
 So for example.. if the Silencer is $479.00 plus .06% county tax = $507.74.. you gotta pay an additional $200 directly to the ATF for the TAX stamp. So total out of pocket would be $707.74. :) Average wait for paperwork to clear the ATF is 5 to 6 months."

As new as the day it left the Italian factory, hang tags still attached, never fired, includes one 15 round magazine(Inox, white follower, metal base plate) that is also new, and all books/boxes as sold new.

The older Italian Inox pistols are getting harder to find everyday, and finding one that's never been used even more rare.

I have owned this pistol since new, and I am only selling to fund a rather expensive custom 1911 build.

The only trades I will consider is high end 1911's($1500 plus price point).
If you have something along those lines, let's talk. Obviously, I am prepared to put money on top if the right 1911 were to come along.

Offered here is an extremely nice MAS MLE 1949-56 with nearly all the accessories that were issued with it. 

This example unlike many is a very good shooter as it has had Bill Toth conversion done which involves rechambering, polishing & gas system modifications(details available). Unlike the Century Arms method which amounted to simply running a 308 chamber reamer into it.

Included with this gun is the original scope mount & rings, B-Square scope mount, 4x spare magazines, night sight, bayonet, small parts & tools, original sling & recoil pad(butt stocks on these are painfully short).

No shipping on this item. Local sales only to Missouri resident with positive ID & signed statement of eligibility.

Offered here is an very nice L1A1(Century R1A1) inch pattern FAL type rifle. Forget what you may have read about Century FALs, this is a VERY GOOD one! Built from all Australian inch parts, very tight, not mixed up inch/metric. Feels, handles, and shoots GREAT! This is one of the best balanced weapons I have ever held. Much lighter than you'd think.

Included in this sale is the original sling, 4x correct inch pattern 20rnd magazines, original Trilux scope & mount, & plain no-scope dust cover. Inch FALs can use either metric or inch magazines though metric mags will fit loose but still function. The more common Metric pattern guns can only use metric mags. If you don't want the scope & mount you can deduct $300 from the purchase price. If I didn't have a super nice M1A I'd never sell this gun!

This rifle is in very nice shape with deep blueing on barrel.All numbers match on this rifle, reciever, bolt and mag floor plate. Very rich history for this rifle. It started out as a rifle made by Remington that they made for the Czar of Russia in the early 1900's for the Russian empire. The Russians then fought the finnish and lost. The Finnish then took these nagants and accurized them with new sights and, in this example, a brand new Sako barrel, which is a company many still know today. The stock has not been refinished as it still has a light coating of whatever the Finns packed these rifles in. Finish is pretty good overall exept for reciever, but it has been through battle. I am asking $400 or best offer.Price is negotiable so feel free to shoot me an offer! text or call me at REDACTED. I live here in Portales which is about an hour and a half from Roswell."

This rifle has been meticulously maintained and was broken in properly. The rifle currently has less than 100 rounds through it. This rifle is super accurate with a 5 shot MOA guarantee from Sako. This also comes with a total of (3) 3 round magazines.

Break in procedure was clean the barrel after each shot for the first 20, then began cleaning after every other shot for the next 10, and tapering off from there.

I also had a JP Enterprises Bennie Cooley Muzzle Brake professionally installed to reduce recoil and muzzle rise. The muzzle rise on this is now almost zero so maintaining sight picture is much easier. The finish on this is AMAZING! The brake looks like an integrated part of the barrel (see pictures).

$85 - Harris Bipod
$130 - 2 Extra Mags @ $65 each
$215 - Professionally installed JP Enterprises Stainless Bennie Cooley Comp

It has exactly 20 rounds through it. This will fit on an existing AR 15 as long as it is mil-spec. You can see the full specification of it on Daniel defense's website. There are absolutely no modifications done to this, it is exactly how I received it. Here is the verbage from the website:

The Daniel Defense, v7-6.8SPC Upper Receiver Group is set up as a Special Purpose complete upper with the Daniel Defense 18” Cold Hammer Forged barrel, along with the new Modular Float Rail 12.0 to provide each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability. Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube. In addition, the installation of Modular Picatinny Rails is accomplished with little effort. This allows the shooter to customize the rail set up. The 18” barrel allows the shooter to accurately reach out a little further than the standard 16” version.

MSRP Pricing
No Sights $949.00 


The v7 6.8SPC URG is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

A rare cosmetic ""blem"" but I can't figure out what the supposed blem is. It functions flawlessly. Very accurate pistol with its match grade polygonal barrel and machined (not MIM) parts. See youtube video reviews by nutnfancy and hickok45.

I purchased it for my wife as a CCW but it's too much gun for her. I'm afraid she'll need a .380. The price means I want to cut my loss and move on.

Someone replied to my earlier post but he lived too far away and wanted me to meet him half way. I'm afraid I don't have time to do that right now. I will meet somewhere in the south metro area, preferably at the South Metro Public Safety Training Facility in Edina. I'll need to see a permit to purchase or carry and a driver's license.

I bought this gun on impulse buy and found out it's really not what I wanted after all. I have 100 rounds through it only, and it was a nice shooter but revolvers are not my thing it seems, so I would like to trade it for something that is. I am really REALLY wanting either an FAL or a PTR91 and I will be willing to add cash atop the revolver for one. Nothing fancy, really, just a range toy, but I would like something reliable and not trashed lol."
