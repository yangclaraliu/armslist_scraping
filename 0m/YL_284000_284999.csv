The PT 24/7 pistols share several safety innovations with other Taurus product lines, including a positive firing pin block as well as the 'Taurus Safety Latch', a transfer bar safety which prevents firing of the pistol unless the trigger is pulled. Together these safeties assure that the pistol will not fire if it is accidentally dropped.  All 24/7 models also include a frame-mounted manual safety lever, and are equipped with an integrated firearm locking safety system, which Taurus calls the ‘Taurus Security System' (TSS). 24/7 pistols are also equipped with a visible/tactile loaded chamber indicator and a dust cover Picatinny accessory rail integration system, allowing for the attachment of accessories such as laser sights or tactical lights. Heinie ‘Straight Eight’ combat sights are for the Pro Handling characteristics of 24/7 pistols are enhanced by features such as an ambidextrous decocking lever and ergonometric design attributes which Taurus calls 'Memory pads', consisting of various grooves which promote proper consistent hand placement for superior handling control.  In addition, a secure grasp of the pistol grip is afforded by a high adhesion gripping surface. An option standard on Pro models is a soft, ribbed, non-slip, hand-conforming grip which Taurus dubbed the ‘Ribber’.

Trigger actions

Pro models sport single action/double action triggers. This system differs from most dual action triggers in that the initial pull is single action with the double action coming into play only on a misfire. Most dual action triggers are double action on the initial shot with subsequent shots being single action. This system allows for two major advantages, one being that the initial trigger pull is light and crisp, therefore more controllable, and the second being that if a round misfires, the trigger can be quickly pulled again in double action mode, repeating the attempt to fire the recalcitrant round. This type of SA/DA system, pioneered on Taurus pistols, is much faster and simpler than the standard tap, rack, bang method of clearing a dud cartridge."

These Brazilian-made guns use a transfer bar safety and have the same four-click cocking motion as the Colt it was patterned after. They also include a patented, child-proof locking key system, which prevents the gun from firing when not in use for additional safety. These guns come with a Lifetime Warranty, which is in full force and effect through Taurus USA of Miami, FL. Included is the original box, owner's manual, warranty card, key and the original factory grips. These guns are extremely well made, well balanced with smooth action and look and feel great in the hand. No Trades."

I should mention is that the butt pad has Bell & Carlson on it. I assume the stock is also a Bell and Carlson but do not know this for sure. The rifle has been in my heated safe for probably 10 years now. It has no problems. 

I bought this gun about 12 years ago from a friend who fell on hard times. He probably had it for a couple of years before that. I've shot it probably less than 30-40 shots. My friend probably shot it no more that that and probably less.

I used it a couple of years during deer seasons and made some remarkable shots with it.  But I rarely hunt deer any longer. While I have used this rifle to kill deer, it's rather brutal for my small frame and not a pleasant rifle for my size so I stopped using it and went with my 30 caliber instead. In short, there is nothing wrong with the rifle but I have always felt it was too much gun for me. It does carry well and hangs on the shoulder well for long walks in or out.

Email me for additional pictures.

I would prefer a trade for this rifle. Please see ""Trade For"" items below for items being sought for trade."

I have here a semi-automatic 12 gauge shotgun, an older Remington model, that recocks/reloads using a large recoil spring--a very reliable system.

The firepower on this thing is insane, it holds 8 rounds with the extended aftermarket magazine tube, and comes with the original parts as well if you prefer to return it to a five round shotgun.

It can pump out those 8 rounds surprisingly fast.  Great fun gun, great defense gun, very well maintained for its age.  Beautiful wood furniture and nicely blued.

I have put probably 300 rounds through it just playing around at the range. There are no nicks, scratches or any cosmetic blemishes.

I will however leave the Tru-Glo Red dot on it because my new AR has a fixed carry handle. I paid over $100 for this Tru-Glo sight. After shipping and FFL fees I paid right at $700 for the gun brand new. That's over $800 I have invested in this rifle.

This rifle is very similar to the Lyman Trade rifle and the Cabelas Hawken. All are made in Italy by Investarms. New, similar models are available but run around 400-500 bucks or more. Asking 225 for this one.

This rifle was made in the 80's and purchased originally by my father. I think he may have taken it out to fire once. Otherwise, it just hung on the wall. The (rifled) barrel looks to be in good shape, hammer is tight, trigger mech works good. Rear sight has elevation and windage adjustments. Rifle overall looks quite nice but can't be considered mint. The ramrod is showing its age- seems a little dry and brittle but should still function. Replacements are widely available.

Asking $225 OBO. A steal for a quality replica muzzleloader. Trades for anything that feeds cartridges (black powder is just not my thing) would be considered. Send me a message if you think we might be able to work something out. Also have a CVA (made by ASM) 1851 Navy in pretty decent shape, should anyone be looking for two black powder firearms."

P2000

The first of the many recent additions to the Heckler & Koch handgun line, the P2000 and incorporate features of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with the latest innovations of HK engineers. A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" model.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.

Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.

With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 - 8.5 pounds (27.5 - 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7N).

The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.

A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike.

Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines.

A limited edition P2000 German Police Model features a ""closed"" accessory mounting rail system and a tapered trigger guard.

Available in 9 mm and .40 S&W.
The P2000 Trigger Variants:

P2000: ?Innovative safety trigger with concealed cocking piece in the hammer and centrally located decocking lever for firing in the DA/SA mode.

I bought this for a build but now we are moving to a place that is very very anti-gun so i'm not building it any longer.  Melonite is the finish on glock pistols and other high quality firearms.  It's longer wearing than chrome lined but adds no structure to the surface, it's a treatment not a coating like chrome lining.  Thus it is also more accurate than chrome lining.  It's also much deeper black than parkerized (typical) barrels and much more scratch resistant (harder).  It's only 24.8oz.

692,http://www.armslist.com/posts/284692,"For Sale:  Colt 1911 .45 $1699obo Serial:512xxx Made in 1918, not a 1911A1","North Side, Atlanta, Georgia","$ 1,699","Listed On: Wednesday, July 24, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Asking 1699 obo.
A genuine Colt's Manufacturing Company .45 Caliber
Its a blued 1911, with a 6 digit serial number 512xxx manufactured in 1918, and is my understanding it would have been a USN/USMC weapon. With the later A1 modifications it would have been used in the Marine Corp, as it is my understanding its was the Marine Corp that had the A1 mods done to the original 1911s.

Being sold as is, where is, without warranty expressed or implied...blah blah blah, you either know what you are buying, and understand the nature and condition of something like this or maybe collecting antique weapons is not for you. ;-)

Labeling reads as follows:
(holding as if shooting)

*Right side on Slide
""MODEL OF 1911 U.S.ARMY""

* Right side on Frame
""No 512xxx""    (This puts the manufacture date in 1918 near the end of a batch of 347,000 made that year. by far the largest single year production run ever)

*Left side on Slide
""PATENTED APR. 20, 1897. SEPT. 9, 1902.
DEC. 19, 1905. FEB. 14, 1911. AUG. 19, 1913.""

Reading from the barrel exit back left to right the above two lines are followed by the Colt horse logo, which is a Rampant Colt—The original logo of Colt's Firearms, (a colt up on its hind legs with an arrow and bow).
After the Rampant Colt continuing back are two more lines of text:

""COLT""S PT FA MFG. CO.
HARTFORD, CT U.S.A.""

*Left side on Frame forward of trigger guard and slide release hole
""UNITED STATES PROPERTY""

Just behind the trigger and just above the magazine release is the inspectors stamp.
This is either ""S18"", ""SIB"" or ""SI8"" with a small graphic of an eagle head above it.

INSIDE:
*Underside of barrel near the back before it tapers up there is a ""G"" (which I think stands for Government contract Order.
*On the slide itself, on the rear section that has the firing pin within it, there is an ""S"" that is contained with a circle just large enough to contain. Also stamped on that section are some hash mark that look like measurement, a number ""4"" is stamped in the middle.

It has what is referred to as a Type 3 hammer.

The wood grips have the finely engraved checkering pattern with large smooth diamond shapes where the screws go in.


What I have been told. 
While it is indeed a 1911 it has some of the modifications for a 1911A1 such as the shoe on the rear of the grip.
It has the shorter trigger, but you can tell its a 1911 because it lacks the tapered cutouts in the frame behind the trigger. It has the longer spur on the hammer. It also has the original grip checkering with the smooth diamond cuts at the screws as opposed to the simplified grip checkering.

Overall condition is:
Fully functional.
Complete.
Finish has most of the original bluing with a little surface oxidation, and a couple small spots of pitting.
Ready to be professionally refinished or restored.

Asking 1599 obo

Also willing to trade for a high end .45 like an Ed Brown, Les Baer or Wilson. Other trades might be both a Sig 556 and Kimber, also after a Remington 1187, stainless Mini-14 and a short barrel stainless .357 or a combination plus cash.


Technically speaking this is NOT a gun, but rather a Curio and Relic, and is there for not considered a ""Firearm"" by definition. I suspect that means it can't be banned.

Slide Fire Solutions
Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide the ability to Slide Fire safely, offering a new element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere!

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to bump fire, the SSAR-15's radical design enables the shooter to fire an AR-15 as quickly as desired without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike traditional bump firing, the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly hold their firearm and maintain complete control at all times. In addition, as a result of the forward movement required to discharge each round, the shooter naturally corrects their point-of-aim for each shot and prevents recoil from pushing the firearm's muzzle upward in an unsafe direction.

In principal the SSAR-15 functions similar to the Gatlin system. When operating a Gatlin system; the shooter operates a crank in a circular motion to activate the firing mechanism. Every 1/5 rotation of the crank will discharge a round. The shooter will then continue forward another 1/5 of a rotation to fire the next round, and so on. With the SSAR-15 the shooter activates the firing mechanism by moving the upper assembly forward to discharge a round. To discharge the next round the operator must again move the upper assembly forward. As with the Gatlin system, an AR-15 equipped with the SSAR-15 will never fire automatically.

Just Bought this rifle and scope and have over $650 in with the scope and rings.  It has been shot six time to zero-in the scope.  It""s a very nice shooting, low recoil, accurate rifle.  I really like the 7mm-08 Remington cartridge.  There's a good review on Gunblast Website on this model.  
I just bought an AR so I need the money to pay that off or I would be keeping this one.

Kel-Tec P-3ATHC (Hard Chrome Finish) semi auto pocket pistol chambered in .380ACP.  

The P-3ATHC is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed Kel-Tec's P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. 

The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 

The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

Details
New in 2011 is Remington's latest introduction featuring Nickel plated UMC pistol ammunition. Nickel Plated casings are typically only found in high-end defense ammunition as it results in smoother feeding and cycling of a weapon. Now, nickel-plated cases are economically available from Remington for range use. This line of ammo also features Kleanbore® primers resulting in a clean reliable burn time after time.

Manufactured by the legendary Remington Arms Company, this product is brand new, nickel-plated brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, and reloadable. It is a staple range and target practice ammunition used by many law enforcement agencies and avid shooters.

In 1816 Eliphalet Remington produced his own rifle in his smithing shop which was superior to commercially available rifles of the day. Ever since then, Remington has been leading the charge in technological innovation bringing superior products to the market.

Note: Remington's bullet type designation ""metal case"" is essentially the equivalent of full metal jacket."

A Benefit of the Glock 20SF is though its made to fire 10mm ammo you can buy aftermarket barrels to fire the .40 SW, .357 Sig, and 9×25mm Dillon. So if your looking to buy a Glock 22 that fires .40 SW you can get a Glock 20 that gives you the option to fire 4 Calibers with a simple barrel swap,

10mm with a 6"" Barrel also makes a great Hunting Cartridge.
