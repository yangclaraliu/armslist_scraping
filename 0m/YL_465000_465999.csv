This is a highly collectable Ruger Security Six 2 3/4"" barrel 357 Magnum in Stainless Steel. This gun is in 99% condition, I say 99% as it is used but not much!!! No rust, scratches, or any other issues. It is flawless.

When I say highly collectable, first off it was made in 1975, this was the first year Ruger made this gun in Stainless Steel, also this is a PRE-WARNING revolver. In 1977 Ruger started put warning stamps on the barrel stating to read owners manuel etc... before using the gun. My gun has no warning, lastly it is the snub nose version made with a 2 3/4"" barrel, these are alot harder to come by as the production numbers on these length barrels were very limited. It has adjustable sights as well. Try and find a 2 3/4"" Pre warning in this condition, you wont, I searched two years before I found this one and it was a fluke, they are just not out there for sale very often???

I have a nice pair of Hogue Grips on the gun and I also have the original wooden grips, the original grips are mint condition. This gun has been fired very little and lockup is super tight and the trigger in single action is crisp, so crisp and light it is amazing. One of the best pistols I have ever owned and fired. Selling it to fund another project!

Lastly this gun comes with a handmade leather holster, this holster was special made for this gun and the two combine for a excellent carry piece.
This gun also comes with two Dade speed loaders and some ammo.

I will accept reasonable offers on this gun package. Additional pictures available upon request. Wichita area only FTF"

Firearm has only been fired from a bench.

I'm also willing to trade for other firearms such as handguns,ars,etc. I'm not really interested in any shotguns or bolt action rifles.

It has a 350 crate engine in it with 5000 miles on it with chrome valve overs and air cleaner, also has new turbo 350 transmission with same mileage. This Vette has the Gymkhana suspension package from the factory. This Vette also came with PL, PW, PS, and factory alarm system. Other options include the deluxe interior and factory positive traction rear differential with 3.42 gears. I just recently installed a AC compressor and converted it over to R134A, but it still does not blow cold like it should. I also just had a alignment done on it, fresh tune up and oil change. The car has headers with true dual exhaust with catalytic converters. This car has a fresh emissions test done on it, and passes with flying colors. I have also installed a Accel super coil for the HEI, and have a Weiand Stealth aluminum intake manifold that will go with the car, as will as a set of roller tip rockers and a Comp cams muther thumper cam. I have 3 different tops for the car which include a set of mirrored glass T-tops that are in great shape, a set of fiberglass T-tops that need to be painted to match the car, and a convertible style soft top. The car runs great and is in pretty good shape inside and out, especially for a 33 year old car. The paint does have flaws up close, and the interior needs some TLC. This is not a show car, it is a good looking driver but it will eventually need paint and interior work. Again this is not a show car, which is why it is priced the way it is. Serious inquiries only please, I do not have a lot of time and it costs money every test drive. I just had the original paint buffed and waxed, so it looks pretty good. The car has a pretty nice JVC CD player with MP3 and Ipod hook up. It is pretty fun to drive with a nice firm fast shift from the new transmission, and pretty good acceleration. This car actually gets pretty good gas mileage, but I also do not have a heavy foot. I am asking 4700.00 O.B.O for this pretty nice Corvette. I am also interested in trades of equal value. My name is Matt and my number is REDACTED. I am not in a hurry to sell so please no low ball offers. The only reason for selling is to many projects, so the room would be nice to have. I also do not need any help from scammers selling it, and kind of scammers will not get a response at all. Thanks for looking and have a nice day."

In my opinion, this is the finest concealed carry pocket gun ever made, with a better trigger than a Smith, and the only reason I'm selling it is because a rarely seen piece I've always wanted came up for sale and I do not get paid until Friday. If this does not sell by Wednesday it will be withdrawn and I'll keep it. This will also be posted on another forum.

Extras include a DeSantis Nemesis pocket holster (one of the best), and two rigid smoke plastic ammo wallets -- a 6 round and a 12 round -- which are far better for CCW than speedloaders or quick strips. Also includes over 200 rounds of ammo, mostly premium defensive hollowpoints. Ammo includes:
Remington Golden Saber +P: 75 rds
Hornaday XTP +P: 25 rds
Glaser Silver +P: 6 rds
Federal NyClad: 12 rds
Magtech RNL: 36 rds
UMC FMJ: 50 rds

LNIB LCR, pocket holster, 2 ammo wallets, and over 200 rds of ammo.

Priced to sell by Wednesday at $395 or it will be withdrawn. I have well over $500 into this and it is a steal at this price.  Need cash for another purchase so no trades.

I can meet anywhere in the greater Denver area.  Will not ship.  Legal buyers only.  No bad guys need reply.  Thanks.

They are, basically pieces of crap until you take the to a gunsmith to make them work right. Regardless of how few you've fired, the Bersa Thunder .380 has problems. It takes about $45-$50 to have the ramp polished, the extractor modified, and in my case, the bolt shaved to get them to eat any kind of ammo.
Either that or, deal with FTF's or FTE's for about 350-400 rounds. That's expensive.
When an ad says only 50 or so fired, that is not a good thing, that means it jammed up and the seller wants to get rid of it.

It comes in original hard case with original 2.5, 4, 6, and 8 inch barrels, both original grips, original tool, and original shim for setting the gap.  It has the original instruction booklet, and the warranty card which no one ever filled out.  It is a great gun with interchangeable barrels and grips that are simple and quick to swap out.  The most accurate revolver I own (also the longest barreled revolver at 8” and shortest at 2.5” that I own).  It has Munson stamped on the frame, so it was made while Dan Wesson was still owned by the Wesson family.  Serial number 27XXXX.  

I bought this gun with the intention of putting a new extra heavy slab side barrel on it and using it for carry, but after I shot it I decided it was just too nice for me to use and abuse.  There is a small chip in one of the grips which is shown in the pictures.  Other than that it’s in great shape for a 40somthing year old gun.  

Price is $1050, and I prefer cash, but am open to trades.  Here are a few of the guns I would consider in trade: Smith and Wesson revolvers (especially in 41 mag or 44 mag), decent 1911s, Colt Delta Elite, 41 magnum lever action, ruger sp101, kahr mk40 or mk9, maybe even a desert eagle or a 500 magnum, but who knows if you’ve got something interesting it can’t hurt to shoot off an email and ask.

Located in Chapel Hill.  You’ll need a copy of your concealed handgun permit or a pistol permit (which I will keep) and a bill of sale.  Obviously all laws will be adhered to, and I have no problem meeting and transferring the revolver at an FFL dealer if that makes you more comfortable.  

Email is the best way to reach me, it goes straight to my phone, so I will reply pretty quick usually.  Don’t hesitate to ask any questions.  If you want to see something that isn’t shown in the pics, just ask. Price is negotiable, but I'm not desperate to sell, it's a fun little gun and it won't hurt my feelings to be stuck with it a while longer."

The legion and TGI guns that Centerfire Systems, j&G and carolina have are all TGI guns that were made a decade ago and have dull finishes and metalurgy as in the older MOLOT manufacturing process.

The slide is 20C, which means that it is 10mm ammo. This means you get A LOT of power behind the bullet, but with that comes a large kick as well. The C in 20C shows that the barrel and slide are both compensated, which greatly reduces the kick. The slide has recently been inspected by a Glock specialist who said that it was not shot much at all as there is still some factory mark on it that says so. This slide has night sights installed on it. A Glock slide Is a very good find as no one will sell just a slide. The total price for this comes out to around 385 but the night sights were not professionally installed. I will send pictures through text or email. I will only deal with person to person transactions, and I am definetly interested in trading if you have the right thing."

Manufacturer Description:

The CAMMENGA MODEL EM3-556 EASYMAG is a heat-treated steel magazine, with tip-proof steel follower, chamfered feed lips, and a stainless steel main spring, which improves upon the reliability and feeding performance expectations for M16 and AR-15 type weapons. Built to last with high-strength 1050 spring-steel finished with a two layer anti-friction coating. The EASYMAG features an open case design that allows for fast loading, unloading, and cleaning. The front half can be unlocked and opened to facilitate rapid loading without the aid of a loading device. The EASYMAG also accepts stripper clips and can be quickly cleaned without disassembly.

Heat-Treated 1050 Steel construction is highly resistant to deformation and maintains critical dimensions. This increases the EASYMAG’s service life, feeding performance, and reliability compared to any similar magazine designs. Continuous curve geometry design provides optimal feeding performance and dramatically reduces the likelihood of malfunctions in battlefield environments. Slide-open design allows for rapid loading, unloading, cleaning, maintenance, and inspection without disassembly. Accepts standard 10 round stripper clips, spoons, and other loading devices.

I don't know if this is an original configuration as there were several experimental versions of this carbine. This is very possibly mfg from a long rifle. The wood and metal are exceptional for it's age. Most all the markings are Lithgow. I have many detailed pictures I will email to any serious interested parties. The bore is bright and shiny with no pitting. It will come with everything pictured including the WWI marked original British Enfield Leather sling (on the carbine), and web sling dated 1941 (same as carbine) which obviously saw combat. The lower/outer band is brass as is the buttplate. There is an original unused WWII pull through with brass end stored in the buttstock. One hundred rounds of non corrosive 174gr FMJ ammunition in WWII marked stripper clips in two WWII marked canvas bandoliers. There are also a couple extra Lithgow marked lower/outer bands (one with screw and sling swivel) and a couple extra stripper clips. 
This is a complete outfit and needs nothing. I am hesitant to let this go but I am looking for a 1911 but will consider all trade or cash offers. I do have a C&R and will ship to a C&R or FFL. I will only ship to a USA address.  Thanks for your interest."

This is a Kel-Tec Sub 2000 chambered in Glock 9mm. It accepts Glock 17 mags in all sizes. I bought this from a friend a couple months ago and decided I didnt really need a carbine. Im selling it with 2 10 round Glock Brand mags and 1 33rd Aftermarket Mag. Everything works great and I'd give it a 8.5/10 for the condition, its in great condition. When I purchased it, the previous owner drill a couple holes about the size of a pencil eraser on the top of the plastic hand guard and on the bottom to mount rails to hold optics and a foregrip. The holes look stock and if it botehrs you, upgraded Quad rails or handguards can be found for cheap. I've fired over 300 rounds in Blazer Brass, Federal, and Winchester White box, never a single Jam. See the pics and let me know if you have any questions.

This is a WWII Australian Enfield .303 SMLE Carbine made in the Lithgow factory and is dated 1941. The wood and metal are exceptional for it's age. Most all the markings are Lithgow. I have many detailed pictures I will email to any serious interested parties. The bore is bright and shiny with no pitting. It will come with everything pictured including the WWI marked original British Enfield Leather sling (on the carbine), and web sling dated 1941 (same as carbine) which obviously saw combat. The lower/outer band is brass as is the buttplate. There is an original unused WWII pull through with brass end stored in the buttstock. One hundred rounds of non corrosive 174gr FMJ ammunition in WWII marked stripper clips in two WWII marked canvas bandoliers. There are also a couple extra Lithgow marked lower/outer bands (one with screw and sling swivel) and a couple extra stripper clips. 
This is a complete outfit and needs nothing. I am hesitant to let this go but I am looking for a 1911, Sig Sauer, Walther PPK, Beretta , etc. in trade. I do have a C&R and will ship to a C&R or FFL. I will only ship to a USA address.  Thanks for your interest."

This gun functions 100% and I’ve never had any problems with it. I just never shoot it and I’ve become bored with it sitting in my safe. I originally bought it as a backup gun for deer hunting but never need to use it because 870’s are so reliable.

30” barrel with permanent fixed choke. Front bead sight. The cool thing about this gun is that it has a recoiling barrel to assist in recoil reduction while out hunting. It’s only chambered for 2-3/4” shells. There is a removable brass ring that allows you to shoot high or low base shells without problems. The gun originally was made to only hold 3 shells but I professionally altered it so it now holds 5.

Gun has scratching at bottom on magazine tube where it gets loaded (as any shotgun does) and some minor wear marks on gun and stock. Very good condition for its age! Get yourself a vintage shotgun that works just as good as the new 1100 and 1187’s!

There are some small scuffs on the barrel, and light wear on the high points of the receiver.The Model 31 was intended by Remington to compete  head to head with the Winchester Model 12. It was successful, but the ball bearing bolt design and other innovations made it too costly to manufacture, and so only 250,000 Model 31's were built, with only a small number of trap grade shotguns like this one. This Model 12 was made in 1948, which was the last year they were made.No trades please"

The M600C Scout Light® attaches by means of an integral thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. Its small size increases weapon maneuverability, increases rail space available for other accessories, and minimizes added weight. It uses a high-efficiency LED emitter, virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break, and a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to create a beam with good reach and significant peripheral light for close- to medium-range applications. Maximum output is 200 lumens, and it produces tactical-level light—more than enough to temporarily overwhelm the night-adapted vision of an aggressor—for over two hours per set of batteries. The M600C has two switch options: (1) a pushbutton tailcap switch: press for momentary on, press further to click constant-on; (2) a momentary-on tape switch with a 7-inch cable that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for maximum light transmission, the M600C is O-ring sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture. Battle-tested, built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black

It was purchased by me used about four years ago, and it looks to be from the late 80's to early 90's generation of Mossbergs. There are a few signs that this firearm has been well-used, such as a few wear marks on the blueing of the magazine tube where the slide makes contact with it (which is difficult to avoid with any shotgun over time), and two or three small scratches on the top side of the receiver.

Functionally, this gun is perfect, and has never failed to fire while it's been in my possession. It works exactly as you would expect a Mossberg to: reliable to the point of boredom. The action locks up tight, and the magazine spring is still strong. It feeds and extracts like clockwork.

There are only two modifications that I've made to it. First, it originally came with a 28 inch vent-rib modified choke bird barrel, and I had that cut down to approximately 20 inches by a professional gunsmith in Spartanburg, and re-beaded, in order to make it more suitable as a home defense weapon. As a result, the shotgun is now a cylinder choke. Second, I've drilled the bottom of the original walnut stock for a steel sling mount, which I'll be including in the sale.

This would be a great beater shotgun if you're looking to save some money over buying one brand new, or it could make a great home defense weapon. I'll also throw in a couple of accessories for this price: an Uncle Mike's nylon sling, and a 5-shot Neoprene shell holder for the stock.

Also, for an extra $20 or so, I have about 50 assorted Remington Express shells I'd like to see go with the sale. These are high-brass 2 3/4ths inch shells. I've got 20 1-ounce Sluggers, 20 27-pellet #4 buckshot shells, and 10 12-pellet 00 Magnum shells. This is my only 12 gauge, and I'll have no need for those once it's gone. These shells seem to retail for around $1 per."

I picked this up at the gunshow last weekend because it intrigued me (I thought it would make a handsome hunting rifle/range toy) but I found something else and now NEED the cash.  I've cleaned out the cosmoline but have not fired it.  It does chamber and fire the dummy rounds I made.  It extracts like a champ. 

Like I said, I just need the cash to fund another gun I just found.  Thus, the only trade I'd be open to would be a HOWA 1500 in 308 (or a Savage or Stevens 308) only.
