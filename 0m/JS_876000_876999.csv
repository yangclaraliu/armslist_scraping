The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

i have a new unfired windham weaponery ar 15 i would like to trade for a nice 1911.

this rifle is new in case(it came with one!) it has chambered but never fired, im just too busy to go out to the swamp range here.
At anyrate, due to these crazy markets im likely not buying ammo anytime soon at afair price so im probably not shooting it anyway. I hate that.

1/9 twist rate, comercial spec buffer tube, castle nut non staked, but its locktited so its not going anywhere folks.

okay so this rifle has received some after market parts, mostly magpul(i didnt mean to go full magpul i swear!) 

it has the str stock, moe + grip, enhanced trigger guard, MBUS, moe forend, moe vertical grip, moe forward sling point, quick detach sling point in the stock, a black hawk single point sling attachment. Also included is the magpul MMS sling which is a 2 point/1 point sling(goes with all those sling points everywhere real nice.)

The action doesnt stop there cause what good is an ar with one mag? in this mag economy, not so good. Not to worry, i got a total of 6 mags included! off to an okay start, these mags are brand new, not in package cause i wasnt planning on buying them to resell for a huge price. some rounds were placed in some of these mags once just to see how they worked and all that jazz, being my first and only ar15 i was curious about a lot of things. Please try to understand

Now your thinking, a rifle with mags is still no good with out ammo, i got your back on that also. Included is all my ammo! .....260 rounds.....Assorted steel and brass. All of it is 55 grain except for the 50 rounds of hornadt steel match, which is a 75 grain BTHP (boat tailed hollow point) 20 rounds are wolf and the rest is assorted brass, probably remington and monarch, i dont remember and i think were at the point where .223 is .223, you can have the ammo can, it reeks of hoppes when i spilled a bottle of it in there years ago.


Now for what i want

i want a 1911, something colt maybe? i want a nice 1911, i dont want your 2000-3000 custom(unless you really want to fork it over!) but seriously im not after anything crazy here, just a very nice example of a 1911
i would like to see some mags, not a bunch but 4 or 5 nice mags would be nice. i would also like to see a holster, a nice holster would be nice, NO IWB. maybe some ammo, maybe not.

oh i want a full size"

Barrel: A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a Mid-length gas system. A2 style profile barrel is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected. Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer, and are marked with the Palmetto State Armory logo on the left side, up front, just below the rail.

Each upper is assembled to order with care, and test fired.

You are bidding on a seldom seen Model 25 Remington pump in 25-20. These slick little rifles were introduced in 1923 and discontinued in 1935 with approx. 33,000 being made. This one is serial number 14559. This rifle is in excellent mechanical condition with very smooth operation. You can see it has been used but not abused. Overall finish is maybe 80% with general thinning to the blue. Carry wear and wear on barrel from over enthusiastic cleaning I'd say. Bore is shiny and unpitted. Stock is solid with no cracks. There is barely a mark on the wood and it has probably 90% of it's original finsh. Forend rates excellent as well. Original REM UMC crescent buttplate. This is a neat little rifle for small game. Original open sights are present.  Do NOT snooze on this piece! 
The rifle also comes with a box of unfired 25-20 rounds.

SPECIAL ALERT - NEW LOCATION FOR RALLY: GLENVIEW

GUN CONTROLLERS PLAN RECRUITMENT AND ORGANIZATION RALLY


*

*/
The ISRA has been notified that the location of this event has been moved due to 
""anticipated larger 

attendance"".  The new location is the Glenview Police Station, 2500 East Lake 
Avenue, Glenview, IL 60026.
/*

The gun control movement is on a roll in the northern suburbs.  
They will be holding a rally to recruit and organize new gun grabbers 
into their campaign to take your guns away from you.

IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS ATTEND THIS RALLY!

As a patriotic firearm owner, you have a responsibly to defend our 
Constitution by challenging those who would tear down our Bill of Rights.  
If the gun controllers are left unchallenged, then they and their friends 
in Springfield will walk all over YOUR constitutional right to keep and bear arms.

EVENT DETAILS

WHEN:  Sunday, January 20, 2013, 2:00 PM

WHERE:  * Glenview Police Station, 2500 East Lake Avenue, Glenview, IL *
(was: Wilmette Public Library, 1242 Wilmette Ave, Wilmette, IL)

WHO:  This event is being hosted by a band of gun controllers 
including Mark Walsh of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence; 
Lee Goodman of Stop Concealed Carry Coalition and; Jennifer Bishop of the Million Mom 
March.  
These people are the real deal - the hard core top dogs of the gun control movement.  
These are the people leading the charge to raid your gun safe and 
confiscate and destroy your guns.  These are the people who want to 
prevent you from carrying defensive firearms.  
These are the people who don't care if you or your family members are raped, 
robbed and murdered by violent criminals.  They only care about one thing - disarming 
you.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRO-GUN PEOPLE

1.  Plan to be at the * Glenview Police Station * between 1:00 and 1:30 so that you can 
get a seat.  
At past events like these, the anti-gunners try to play a game claiming 
that the room is ""full"" so as to  deny entry to pro-gun people.  
Our aim is to ensure that there are more of OUR people there than THEIR people.

2.  Be observant of abuses of your First Amendment rights by village officials.  
Get the name and title of any official who attempts to 
suppress your right of free association, assembly and speech.

3.  If you have an I-GOLD t-shirt, hat, or badge, wear it!  
If you have an ISRA hat or an NRA hat, wear it!

4.  If you see members of the media there, don't wait for them to come to you.  
Rather,  actively approach them, tell them you are a law-abiding firearm owner, 
and then tell them that you adamantly oppose punitive gun control laws 
being proposed by the organizers, Obama, and Emanuel.  
Make sure the media hears our side of the story first, and often!

5.  Bring your children, grand children, and other young people with you.  
They are the next generation of patriots.  Let them see how effective 
grassroots organizing works!  If there is a question and answer session, 
have your children ask the organizers why they want to leave kids 
and their parents defenseless against criminals.

6.  Be polite, but be assertive.  Do not let the anti-gunners shout you down.  
Defend your 2nd Amendment with passion.  
If you have a smart phone, video as much of the proceedings as you can.

7.  Remember, this is our Lexington, this is our Concord.  
Be prepared to teach the gun controllers a lesson in Liberty.

8.  Please share this Alert with your friends and family - 
encourage them to show up at the rally.

9.  Please post this Alert to any and all Internet blogs 
and bulletin boards to which you belong

REMEMBER - YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRESERVING YOUR FREEDOM - 
IF YOU DON'T DO IT, NOBODY ELSE WILL"

Among the most unique magazine designs, the 30/45 magazines were designed with an extendable bottom section that would allow the magazine to be fully loaded to 30 rounds and stored (with the base extended) with the spring under minimal pressure. This allowed long-term storage of fully-loaded mags with no wear to the spring or the feed lips. They can also be loaded with 45 rounds when the base extended, though they shouldn't be stored in this configuration.

I'm reluctantly putting my beretta neos carbine kit up for sale. This will convert any beretta neos handgun into a fun, accurate little carbine. 

Initially, the handle's indentation was too small for the magazine release, so I had to file it down a bit. This made grip look a bit rough on the inside. You can probably fix it with some sandpaper, but when everything is put together all that stuff is invisible, so I never bothered.  Aside from that, the kit is in excellent condition, and I'm only letting it go because I traded my Neos away. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!"

I've now witnessed it be maliciously destroyed by politicians who care only about their money and power. A government where the wants of a few out way the needs of the many. I am an avid gun enthusiast whether I am target shooting or hunting. I love this country and would be more then willing to give my life for it if it asked. But I will not give up my god given rights that millions of American service men and women have died to protect, just so these politicians that are "" for the people by the people"" can worry more about their legacy an money can throw it all away. But again I'm an American and although I do not agree with these laws that have been passed I will follow them because as an American I feel that I am held to a higher standard then that of a citizen of a godless and lawless country. I will not roll over because as an American it's my right to fight these laws but I will do it legally and if I lose then I will continue to obey these laws that were set before me. As all of you should. 

On a few side notes though, the govenor can tell me I can only have seven bullets in my magazine but, I can still own 50 magazines and I can loads a magazine in under ten seconds so what is he hoping to obtain either way I have 350 rounds that can be shot.

Also If i don't have to give up my car if some drives drunk with theirs then why do I have to give up my gun if some one uses theirs illegally? Or shout I limit my car to 7 miles a day? 

Like I said I don't agree with the laws but I will obey them till the law says I don't have to or I'll just move to Texas as we got a nice invite from their govenor.

This rifle comes with the much more desirable top hand guard rather than the typical metal shield that the newer model Mini-14s come with. I will include an M-14 style flash hider with this rifle. The extras that will come with this rifle will be listed below:

- Mini-14 M-14-style birdcage flash hider
- 20 round STRAIGHT magazine (looks like an actual M1A magazine)
- 30 round magazines (2 of them)
- 40 round magazine
- Leather sling.

This is a great package to get you started. Almost everything you need to make this rifle look much like the M-14 that it is supposed to look like. All that you need to order is the Accu-Strut to complete the look of an M1A/M-14. $1000 cash or $1100 trade."
