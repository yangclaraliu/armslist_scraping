I just never warmed up to the .45 ACP and preferred .40 and 9mm so this XD .45 was only used at the range, mostly by friends who wanted to try .45 caliber.

I would consider straight trades in Gen 4 Glock in .40/9, M&P full/sc .40 or M&P shield in 9/.40, Beretta PX4 (F) in .40/9.

XDM or XDS in 9/.40, AR15 (I'll bring money to the table)."

I bought this last week and never even got a chance to sight it in. Yesterday I came across a deal for a M&P 15-22 that I couldn't pass up so I had to pick it up. I don't need this AK47 also so I am putting it up for trade. This is the only 22 that Kalashnikov approved and it has his name stamped on the side. It was sold by ATI in the US, but is made by German Sport Guns in Germany. It includes a couple of tools that came with it, one 25rd magazine, the box, and a manual. There are a couple of light scratches on the wooden stock that must have happened in the box, but they are very minor. All the wood is real wood and not plastic made to look like wood.
 I am interested in trading for the list below. I can put cash with my trade if needed and I have another posting for two 22 rifles that I could include for the right trade. The link to that posting is at the bottom of this posting.

Please include a picture with your offer for trade.

AR15's.

It is similar to the M42 
and M44 commercial rifles and many parts are interchangeable. With the proper magazine, you can use .22 short, .22 long, and .22 LR 
in this rifle. Without the magazine, you can use it as a single-shot rifle, the magazine holds seven (7) rounds. The rifle has
 a bull barrel with recessed muzzle; the trigger is not adjustable, the front sight is fixed, and the rear sight is a micro-adjustable
 peepsight Mossberg S100, Mossberg S133, or Lyman 57 MS (and there may be other sights out there). The barrel is ""lead-lapped"" which is 
a process (as explained to me) that fills in the micro-cracks in the metal producing a very smooth surface with very little variance 
or imperfections. It is also very labor intensive and, as a result, expensive.
 Manufactured approx. 1943-1946.
 No magazine for it.

It's a cosmetic ""blem"" as identified by the very small ""B"" stamped on the trigger guard (not noticeable unless you're looking for it). When I purchased the gun from the FFL just a couple months ago, neither of us could find the blem. To this day I still haven't figured it out. From the match grade polygonal barrel to the steel slide spring rod and assembly, it's a flawless gun, in looks and function. It's a made in the U.S.A. gun using machined rather than MIM parts. 

According to my spreadsheet, I've fired a total of 131 rounds through it since I purchased it from a respected FFL in August. Speer Gold Dot Short Barrel 124 +P; Federal HST LE Tactical 147; Winchester Ranger T 147; Remington UMC 115; Winchester White Box 124; Federal American Eagle 124. NOT ONE MALFUNCTION OF ANY KIND. 

It's too snappy for my wife and the grip is too small for my large hands.

Since I've inherited, my friends and I have fired 20 total rounds of factory weatherby 270 magnum rounds. This rifle is a pleasure to shoot and unfortunately, I don't hunt or have a use for it. The value of this gun retails for $2300 as listed on the Weatherby website. Due to it's age and low serial number, it will eventually be a collectible item

Trade value is $1500, which includes Factory Weatherby scope (2x - 7x), factory leather 2 point sling, 20 rounds of 270 weatherby magnum rounds. It has a cheap centerpoint scope mounted right now due to the windage and elevation dials on the weatherby scope are very tough to turn. I can include that as well. Below you will see videos of 2 of my friends firing it.

For those of you with Utah or Florida conceal carry permits etc, this makes a excellent conceal carry gun/pocket gun. or for those of you that are just looking for a pocket pistol with some punch then this will fit the bill. It has excellent high profile Bardot sights. It is chambered for 9mm yet the pistol is the size of most compact 380's. If you just want the pistol and the one 6 round flush magazine that came with it then you can have it for $425, if you want everything that is shown in the picture that being the pistol, one 6 round magazine, one 8 round magazine, a DeSantis pocket holster, and 50 rounds of pmc 9mm, then you can have it all for $500. Do some research and you will see how excellent these guns are. PS why have a 380 when you can have a pocket gun the same size as a 380 yet shot a much better round in the 9mm. Not to mention this gun is two tone and sharp looking. Buyer must be a Illinois Resident with valid Illinois FOID card and sign bill of sale."

957,http://www.armslist.com/posts/601957,For Sale:  Springfield XDM40,"NW OKC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 575,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 23, 2012",Handguns,Springfield                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"Most gun companies, when releasing a new handgun chambered in 9mm will also release another version of the pistol in .40 S&W because the guns are so similar in dimension that it is easy to produce both guns on the same production line with minimal tool adjustment. This proved true for Springfield Armory as well when the released their XDm-40 3.9 in .40 S&W at the same time as the 9mm version of the pistol.

As with its 9mm cousin, the XDm-40 3.8 is what many would consider to be a “Commander” sized XDm pistol. The term “Commander” gained popularity when Colt released a new 1911 pistol with a shortened barrel cut down from 5” to 4.25”. This was the only change to the gun, however, and the lower receiver of the gun carried the exact dimensions of the original.

This is the case with the XDm-40 3.8. The shorter, 3.8” barrel of this compact pistol was designed to make it easier carry the gun on a daily basis. The design has come under criticism though because the popularity of IWB holsters means that the length of the barrel is of little significance where concealment is concerned while the length of the grip is of utmost importance. Of course, the grip length on the Springfield Armory's 3.8” version of their XDm-40 pistol is exactly the same as the original thus calling into question the implied concealment benefits of the design.

Other criticism which has arisen is the assumption that the shorter barrel of the XDm-40 3.8 will result in significantly lower velocities as and devolved accuracy. Testing has shown, however, that the muzzle velocity of the commander-sized XDm is usually within 30 f.p.s. of the full-size version of the pistol and any discrepancy in velocity can usually be overcome by loading the gun with +P ammo such as that offered by Buffalo Bore Ammunition. Some shooters feel that the level of accuracy is diminished a bit and others say that if the gun is used as a carry gun for self-defense, any accuracy difference is negligible for the application. We'll leave it to the reviewers to chime in on this one more fully.

The XDm 3.8 was the first in the lineup to be offered with the “V” shaped (M)ajor Grasp front and rear slide serrations which many (but not all) feel is an improvement to the Rearward-Only slanting serrations on the original XDm. Springfield Armory offers this pistol in both black (M)elonite and Stainless Steel Bi-Tone finishes and the gun ships standard with 3-Dot, low-profile combat sights which can easily be upgraded to night-sights if you so choose.

The gun comes with an integrated rail system, a loaded chamber indicator, a striker status indicator, and enhanced (M)ega-Lock grip texture. The highly-acclaimed combo trigger safety/grip safety is retained on this XDplatform gun as well. The magazine capacity on the XDm-40 3.8 shrinks from 19 to 16 rounds but this is not bad considering the fact that the 4” standard XD-40 only carries 12 rounds in the standard magazine.

Included with the gun is the original M1907 sling which alone is worth around $300! The gun looks great and has an excellent finish! Please note that the pictures make the finish of the gun look a lot worse than it actually is! I'm not sure why the pics came out making the finish look so brown but it actually has a nice blue finish to it! The only problem with this gun is that it is missing the heat shield/bayonet lug. I realize this makes the gun look more like a riot gun but it has been checked out by a Winchester expert and it is 100% an original Trench Gun. You can get reproduction heat shields/lugs all over the place but I have yet to find an original one to put on the gun. That is why I am selling it for only $2100!

Call or text 580-606-2802

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT: Six great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

1. ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK OEM sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation.

2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3. INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm.

4. FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.
