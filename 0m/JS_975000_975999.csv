Up for sale my Savage .338 lapua rifle. I bought it from Cabelas last year.

Under hundred rounds. Excellent condition. Everything is clean. Very accurate.
This thing is huge and is a blast to shoot. Round is enormous. Muzzle break is quite efficient though. While your shoulder will definitely feel it working, it is not that bad.

Comes with one magazine.

Rail system included. Bipod included. I have a case which I can add to this sale, but the rifle won't completely fit in it.

This is an awesome revolver - Super low round count, very clean - meticulously and lovingly cared for.  It mostly comes out to show to people for a laugh.  And with that said, it would be nice to apply this beauty towards something I will use and appreciate for more than a laugh.  It comes in the Ruger hard case with appropriate contents, a barely broken in Mernickle leather holster and approximately 130 assorted rounds that will last you for a long while.  THIS WOULD BE A PACKAGE DEAL, I will not split up.  Long before nonsense knee-jerk pricing, the revolver alone ran over $1K online.  You will never find one in a shop unless they just put it out when you walked in, or your friend owns the shop.  It also accepts 45 Long Colt.  Please have a CCW/PPP, NCDL and be prepared to sign a Bill of Sale.  The last picture has a Casull round directly next to a .357 Magnum for reference. Thank you for looking.

Fixed front A2 sight post, and a rear flip up rear sight; perfect for anyone wanting to mount a red dot scope.

Windam is an excellent and superior AR, best bang for the buck!  After Bushmaster was sold to Remington, the previous Bushmaster owner retained the equipment and hired back the laid off Bushmaster staff to create a new company in a new location outside of liberal NY; now located in Windham, Maine.  The result is a superior weapon; lower receiever made of T-6 aircraft aluminum, chrome lined bolt carrer, gas keys, bolt and chamber!  Windham is very rapidly coming up the food chain with their high quality and reputable AR's with their deep roots in the AR community and platoform.  This is from the creators/owner of Bushmaster, but raised the bar to make it better!! All parts are 100% American made, and comes with a transferrable lifetime warranty.

Other items worth note; the weapon comes in a hard carrying case, includes sling, one high capacity 30 round magazine, and all original paperwork.  Again, best bang for the buck; upper is smooth and butter, trigger is crisp, and its litghter than all the ARs I own.  New in box and unfired!  It has the forward assist and ejection port cover.

Item Description

This Eye Catching Ruger 10/22 with Archangel stock system plus BMG style SHARK BRAKE 

of hi tech aluminum alloyit is loaded with Extras including the already mentioned and 

pictured $180.00 Valued Archangel Body Kit Comes with 2 Magazines The 3-9x40mm Barsca 

Scope is included!! DETAILED INFO: Archangel is a AR style military look “black 

rifle” appearing with greatly expanded accessory mounting versatility.
- as the pictures show there are 3 separate picatinny style areas of sight/scope and 

accessory mounting rails. As well there is a quad rail finishing the front of the 

free floating fore-stock. This allows you to continue to install a wide variety of 

tactical accessories designed for the AR-15/M16 platform for live-fire training with 

low-cost .22 LR ammo. The stock is created from tough reinforced molded polymer. The 

upper receiver housing with integral Picatinny rail (noted) accepts a broad array of 

popular tactical optics. The free-float handguard has plenty of oblong cooling vents 

to keep the barrel from overheating, plus full-length Picatinny rails (noted).
Adjustable, six-position buttstock replicates the feel and functionality of USGI M4 

carbine stock, and has two ambidextrous receptacles for single- point push button 

slings. The ergonomically shaped pistol grip has comfortable molded-in finger grooves 

and a roomy internal storage compartment.
Note the added 5 position locking front hand grip closed and fronted by a small 

additional picatinny rail set. A very functional finish for this beauty.
Certain measures were taken to protect the 10 22 used as the basis for this build. 

Before enclosing the barrel in the fore- stock it was coated with a light layer of 

anti corrosion gun oil which is not noticeable under the stock parts yet is nice to 

know it is there. The front picatinny quad rail is also underlay-ed with a thin 

plastic layer to shroud the barrel under it from marks it may have otherwise 

incurred, the setup is very tight and in spite of the protection it is immovable 

until one loosens the set bolts. Tools should be included in your shipment should you 

ever wish to do this. You may note that the scope is mounted with quick release 

mounts that are however also real weaver mounts and very good at keeping zero. I will 

laser bore sight the scope. The gun however having not been fired [brand new from the 

box] has not been zeroed with real ammo. This could be done at a short range if the 

high bidder wishes, however the laser does a fair job and you can tweak it quickly at 

the range.
COOL!.........................................
be sure to look at the photos showing in particular the picatinny quad rail that 

finishes the fore-tock ........................................ Very 

nice......................................

ASK ABOUT the flickr photo set, the only difference is the clip will be black and the 

scope is a Barsca with two rings, a great setup.
Please feel free to contact me for any and all questions!


You may also note in the photos the front quad-rail / smaller set of 360 degree span 

picatinny mounts at the fore end of the stock which can be removed in under a minute 

with the included allen wrench to display the totally free floating barrel inside the 

fore stock. The barrel of the weapon is technically free floating. In some long range 

accuracy situations there may be some small measurable increased accuracy without the 

fore end quad rail, however, in tactical situations, home defense, night operations, 

with flashlight and laser, or other sight options the quad rail offers twice as many 

mounting locations as without it. Good and rapidly accessible features available to 

fit whatever shooting situation you encounter.
Keep an eye for further additions as there may be a laser / light photo coming up . 

Thank you for watching. God Bless, and may we keep rolling with all our ""Bill of 

Rights, and second amendment freedoms"", guaranteed by our own right to bear arms. 

""What part of ""shall not be infringed"" did you not understand?"" - you did notice that 

-shall not be infringed- is an absolute statement did you not? The founding fathers 

meant for there to be NO infringements on the right to bear arms, of any kind. The 

second amendment is simple and straightforward. Any infringement is a violation of 

it.

Item Description

This beautiful brand new Beretta PX4 is NEW IN BOX, has barely been touched since the factory packed it,This gun is ready to go with you anywhere,Or protect you and your family at home. Comes with 6 Magazines 2 X 14 ROUND ORIGINAL MAGS + 4 X 17 ROUND BERETTA FACTORY MAGS!!!! DETAILED INFO: ""In the world of handguns, Beretta is best known as the carry gun of Martin Riggs in ""Lethal Weapon"" and for replacing the M1911A1 as the U.S. military's service pistol. However, Beretta also produces many handgun models for a variety of purposes including concealed carry. One of Beretta's more recent offerings is the Px4 Storm series of semi-auto handguns."" Beretta Px4 Storm Subcompact in AMERICAN RIFLEMAN ""The gun shot like a charm. It was one of the lightest recoils that I have experienced in a polymer framed .40 caliber gun. The customized grip, the clear 3-dot sights and SA/DA trigger pull made it easy to get consistently tight groupings. As much as I like my Beretta Cougar, I have to say that the PX4 has surpassed it in handling and accuracy"" Review: Beretta PX4 Storm on Genitron.com ""A Beretta PX4 Storm shows up with plenty of extras that add value and user-friendliness to its list of standard features. The Storm is delivered with three checkered back straps that allow the individual shooter to tailor the size of the grip to their hand for the best possible fit and the magazine release is reversible, allowing left and right-handed shooters to, again, tailor the pistol to their requirements. Larger magazine release buttons are also available. On all but the “C” model PX4 Storms, an ambidextrous manual safety/decocking lever is standard. All PX4 Storm pistols are delivered in a padded box with two magazines. Those who have fired Beretta pistols in the past will find the controls in familiar places, while those new to the model will need only a few magazines to start becoming accustomed to its configuration."" GUNBLOG Beretta PX4 Storm Pistol Review by Joshua Silverman ""The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability. Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense. 1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. 2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions. 3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer. 4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc. 5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop. 6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol. 7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol. New Adjustable Sigths Kit Other PX4 Accessories 8. Magazine: High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds (1 round for .45 Auto caliber). 9. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use. 10. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. 11. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design. 12. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction). Visit the new PX4 Web Site WWW.PX4STORM.COM"" Beretta Px4 Storm, Full Size, .40S&W BERETTAUSA.COM

This All-American pump gun brings hunters the best of all worlds. Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in the legendary Model 870 Wingmaster®, but at a much more affordable price.

Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years.

Key Features:
26"" or 28"" vent-rib bead-sighted barrel 
Standard Express finish on barrel and receiver 
Shoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells

Please dont wast your time telling me you can find them cheaper, if that was true you would have bought the cheaper ones and moved on . If they dont sell i will keep them."

Not gas carbine, this is a piston rifle.  What is the difference?  Well, instead of gases pushing the bolt carrier group back, an actual piston does the work, keeping the dirty gases to a minimum in the upper chamber and allowing for a cleaner operating rifle.  I am selling the complete factory package.  This is a must have to any collection and because of RUGER's quality, you can expect this rifle to be the envy of your friends.  Truth be told, next to my Daniel's defense ($2500), this is the finest rifle I have ever purchased.  It is solid, perfect milling/workmanship.  The attention to detail is impressive.  Very solid bolt carrier group and the operation is smooth and solid.  (Nothing less from Ruger!)

This comes with a 12"" free float handguard, adjustable gas block, and is competition ready.  No need to purchase extra parts, barrel nut tools, vise blocks, gas blocks, etc.  Just bolt on your accessories and you have an awesome rifle.  Whether you want to compete in 3-gun, at the range, or on the farm, this rifle is something to consider. Or if you just want to put the fear of death into that boy trying to date your daughter, look no further.

The safety won't engage properly with hammer cocked. Hammer down it works just fine. Also when hammer is cocked and safety partially engaged, if you press trigger enough to trigger sear, when safety is placed in fire position, hammer will drop.

----I have a leatherman MUT AR15 multitool.  Ive never used it.  I attached it to my rig but havent had a need for it.

From my reading, this pistol was made for a short time in 1996.  The ventilated rib sets it apart from other 622s.  I have only seen a couple of these for sale on Gunbroker over the past several years.
This is a very light weight .22 pistol with adjustable sights. It will come with two 10 round magazines.   There is a small scratch visible in the last photo. It comes with the S&W plastic case.  This pistol shoots well but a good portion of its value comes because it is collectible.  Therefore, it has spent most of its time in the safe while I have owned it and my interests are more in the old military firearms.


The 622 is identical to the 422 with the exception of the finish.  The 422 is blued and the 622 has the stainless finish.  If you are familiar with the 622, you know that the 622 Target models with adjustable sights normally came with wood grips.  This was not the case with the 622VR.  They were delivered with the black rubber grip.

I am in Kissimmee and not planning to travel to show this pistol. Please look closely at the pictures."

This is the original AR platform - the CAR 15
Here is the full info:

Here is a link to one that sold recently with the long barrel which is much more common:

http://www.gunsamerica.com/921536447/Olympic_CAR_15_pre_ban_Pristine_condition.htm

This is a brand new, never fired classic. When these were being made in the late 80's they were by far one of the best quality AR on the market. They are not made to this quality nowadays. Ive decided there are some other toys I want more than this one so Im selling it. Its been stored now for over 20 years! 
The serial number is V followed by 4 digits. You can confirm the manufacture date on Oly Arms website ""What does my serial number mean"" webpage. 

This has the impossible to find 11.5 barrel with 5.5 permanently attached supressor making it meet the 16"" barrel length requirement. This is an extremely rare rifle!

This has the highly desired SS 1 in 7"" barrel like our soldiers use and chromed bore and chamber for optimum performance and durability. It still all stock with the original box and accessories. 



Im taking cash and trade offers. 
From my research these seem to start at about 2K for a pre-ban 80's model, never fired. And it's almost impossible to find one with the 11.5"" barrel. I'm not looking to get every last dollar on this but I'd take the lower end of what these appear to be bringing. 

I also have about AR mags and I can include as many as you want for the right price. See my other listings. 

Im located basically on the DE/PA/MD border. I prefer FTF sale but can do shipping to FFL.

I have sold several rifles from me personal colection and can email you the previous listings and contact info for the buyers who I have shipped to. 
Beware of the really low prices - if its too good to be true, it probably is.

This has only had 50 rounds down the pipe for a function test only. This pistol takes the 10 or 25 round Smith & Wesson 15-22 magazine. I have misplaced the magazine and can not find it, therefore, this will not come with one. You will have to purchase your own magazine from somewhere else, or if you have the 15-22 rifle, then you already own a magazine to fit this pistol. This pistol will come with the factory box, paperwork, & lock. These are very rare pistols because they were discontinued a couple years ago. I have seen these go on gunbroker from $1,350 to $1,625 a piece, look up the completed auctions if you don't believe me. This is a quick way for someone to make some cash. This is an extremely fun pistol to shoot, I just don't have a place to shoot it anymore. My loss, your gain."
