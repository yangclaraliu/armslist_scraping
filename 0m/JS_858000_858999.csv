Serbian snipers in the hills surrounding the city rained down deadly fire on the city below. All 3 sides used this rifle and others smuggled in to sow terror by indiscriminately fire to decimate their respective enemies. The Yugoslavs chambered this rifle in 8mm because their Nazi stocks of captured weapons after WWII were in this caliber and their factories were already tooled up for this excellent, flat shooting, high velocity round. Also important was the fact that the dictators: Stalin and Tito were none too fond of one another to the point that Yugoslavia, who had lost 1.5 million men in the war weren't about to be bullied by the Russians. Tito also refused to become a member of the Warsaw Pact which partially meant they could, to a point, use their own designs in firearm development as they were non-aligned. This rifle uses a modified Kalashnikov action and is loosely patterned after the Dragunov and was produced in the Zastava factory which is still carved out of a mountainside only accessed by steel blast doors using machinery that was manufactured by the same factory that manufactured what is considered to be one of the world's best AK's and other small arms. Not many were brought over and all the pre ban rifles were confiscated by the ATF since they were later considered machine guns as the sear was considered to be easily manipulated to fire in the automatic mode. I like this rifle better than the Tiger and it is light years ahead of the unfortunate Romanians whose AK's are considered by some to be the worst made small arms of the world. This rifle has not fallen victim to the few rifles of thiis model I have seen in shops abd shows: some uunscrupulous dealers have removed the range finding Zrak scope with Chinese cheapy scopes and selling the Zrak scopes to maximize their profit. Comes with two ten round magazine that eerily resembles the German G or K-43 magazines of their time. Thirty round after market magazines are available as an accessory. Looks like they are welded Solothurn mags. Anyway, this rifle has a forged receiver to enhance accuracy and will be among top collectibles in years to come. No trades or offers.

The countdown mag shows you how many rounds are remaining in it.  I'm sure I have forgotten some of the extras I will throw in, but it includes everything pictured plus more spare parts.   I never imagined selling this gun, so I have used it as my gun.  There are a few scratches here and there from use, but nothing major. 

I am super firm at $1600.   I have lowered my price. I'm tired of haggling. I will let it go for cash only. No trades. If I don't sell it, I will keep it. I've had a ton of offers for trades and lowball cash, but it would take $1600 to buy this. Don't mean to be rude but I had about 25 trade offers yesterday and I can't think straight this morning. The only trade offer I would consider is another AR. I would take an ar10 if someone really wanted to get back to a 5.56, or I would take a cheap AR as a partial trade, like a stock dpms or something. That's its. No other trade offers please.

I will be up front and say I couldn't get one of the blinkers to work. I couldn't tell if it was the wiring on the trailer or in my vehicle. You can buy a complete new wiring kit with tail lights at tractor supply for like 30 bucks. This is a really strong trailer. It tilts and has a winch but I would say it is probably too short for a sled as the last foot or so would hang off the back. has suspension springs, tires are good. Looking for $400, a firearm or combo of the two. It is in fairfax if you want to look at it. No tire kickers please because it is at my brothers and I don't want to bother him too much with this.

I am also open to a tactical 22 rifle like a Sig 522 or a M&P 15-22 (no ruger 10/22 or GSG) I'm looking for a Beretta 92, 1911, or brands like FNH, SIG, Glock, Springfield, Ruger, Let me know what you have and maybe we can make a trade.

We know that security and reliability are prevaling priorities when you need our products, and that's why gunVault pistol safes have the features you want: Improved high strength lock mechanism. Precise fittings virtually impossible to pry open with hand tools. Over 12 million user selectable access codes available. Audio feedback instantly confirms correct keypad entries. Audio disable feature allows ""stealth"" mode operation. Battery power for maximum security and easy portability. Tamper indicator notes invalid entry attempts. Built in computer blocks access after repeated invalid keypad entries. GunVault Technology: GunVault Bio uses specifically fingerprint recognition, to access the safe contents. A high-performance algorithm is used to achieve speedy identification of enrolled fingerprints; and at the same time has a very low False Reject rate (FRR) for a given False Accept Rate (FAR). This self-learning algorithm of the GunVault Bio adds new minutiae to the fingerprint templates each time a user touches the finger print sensor, which decreases the likelihood of FRR, updates slight changes that might occur over time to an enrolled fingerprint, as well as to help distinguish variations. System can handle a maximum of thirty fingerprint templates between the enrolled fingerprint.

Secondly, I am very firm at $220.  This is a steal for a M-38 wartime-manufacture carbine. One was just sniped in the last seconds at $255 on a gunbroker auction two days ago that I watched to determine my own price.  That purchaser had to pay FFL costs and shipping as well, so please do not make any more offers. I am not looking to get rich off this, only sell it at fair market value. Thanks."

This is a Rossi single shot chambered in .223.  It has a heavy bull barrel and a              4-12x40mm scope.  I've added a basic sling and that will come with the gun.  It was purchased new by me at Dick's Sporting Goods in Hamilton, Ohio about 3 years ago.  It has been sighted in and will drive nails at 100 yards.  I have not shot it over that distance because I have not shot it since I sighted it in.  I meant to as it was purchased to shoot coyotes on a co-worker's property, but that never happened.

The gun is very well balanced and is easy to break down and clean.  It does have a manual safety above the upper left grip.  The rear sight is also adjustable for windage. The magazine holds .22 LR.

 ""Are we at last brought to such a humiliating and debasing degradation, that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defence? Where is the difference between having our arms in our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defence be the *real* object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?""

 I'm unsure of the receiver, it has an omega sign with a line closing the bottom of the omega. The barrel is a KT 6.8SPC heavy barrel, 1/10 twist. 
It has a YHM flash supressor, mid-legth gas block with built in flip up front sights and bayo lug and sling attatchment, green handguards, top reciever rails, rear ARMS flip up sights, foward assist and of course dust cover, standard chargine handle and bolt assembly.

If you have any questions I will do my best to answer them. I do know this needs to to on a pre-ban receiver.  To get around that, you'll have to take the bayonet lug off.  The bottom part can be taken off and have someone cut or grind the lug off.  After you do that, then you can put it on your lower receiver and registered as a 6.8 caliper.  Make sure you're knowledgeable about your laws and what you can have on your AR. It is not my responsibility to know what you can and cannot have. 

This is not considered a rifle, it is considered as parts so no paperwork is needed.  Cash sale only.  If you see this post, then it's available.  I will take down once sold.

I no longer hunt Elephant. LOL. This is a custom built Rifle based on a 44 Preduzece Model 98 Mauser. The Reciever has been rebarreled to .458 Win Mag that is 20"" long. The bolt has been completely redone, trued and lapped in and had a new firing pin installed. The bolt handle was lowered from a straight position for scope clearance and comfort. Greenish Laminate stock. The gun is parkerized and the scope mount is a steel ring leupold. The scope is a Burris 3-9x40 Fullfield II with Reticle focus. This cartridge was designed for BIG GAME. I just had to include a photo of the .458 round next to a .223 and a .308 . Having problems with cape buffalo, elephant, and rhino? this will do the job. All kidding aside this caliber is also great for deer and especially Hog. Slow moving heavy bullet with plenty of knock down power and not as much meat explosion as the high velocity impacts that can shread a lot of meat uselessly. Less deflection on a twig or other small obstruction while bush hunting and still able to make the kill. Plus its a hoot to shoot and show the ammo to your friends, lol. Included are 9 rounds of Ammo and 10 once used brass. Winchester Superspeed 510 grain soft points. I can not even begin to express the amount of work that goes into a rifle like this, though I do have a full series of Gunsmith training videos from the American Gunsmithing Institute that can."

This gun has a really low round count. It was used for deer hunting and rarely shot but it does have a little holster wear at the end of the barrel and a few small marks on the scope. This gun is a hand cannon but suprisingly shootable. The porting makes the gun very manageable and very accurate. Also there is a secondary rubber (red) in the spine of the grip that helps absorb recoil. You can also shoot .45 Long colt with this gun and it is cheaper to do so. Below is a list of items (and their values) included to make this a great deal. 

Has a nice Weaver handgun scope ($175+ new).   Scope mount ($50) Holster ($30) Partial Box (15) Magtech Ammo ($20)

Thats over $290 in extras on a gun that is priced at market value.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Good bore and very little usage on the gun it is in excellent shape. It's been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected.

Price is firm. I will not respond to lower offers, sorry.

Please note that Magpul no longer includes the dust covers with Gen M2 PMAGs. If you really care about the dust covers, they can be purchased separately from various retailers ($1 each MSRP); no chance that dust covers will be banned - that would make it too obvious to the average American that this push for gun control has NOTHING to do with reducing violent crime and is targeted squarely at law abiding gun owners.

If you have the money to pay for these mags, I urge you to spend $25 and join the NRA. I have $25 membership applications, which saves you $10 over the usual $35 annual membership fee (you can also pick these up at most gun shops)."
