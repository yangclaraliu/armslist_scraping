Nice Beretta 92 for sale. Got it about a month or so ago and haven't even taken it to the range yet and have only done a quick test fire to assure I was good to go. Slide is one of the smoothest that I have ever seen on a pistol and the grips are fantastic. Not too heavy, not too light, all around a fantastic gun. Just don't need it. If you can get a better deal somewhere else then by all means you should do so but please don't get on here and think that I care to know that. Must have ccw or valid purchase permit. Price is firm. Gun comes as is with one magazine. Asking 450

I have put exactly 1 box of 50 rounds through this gun using the .40S&W barrel.   (I have a separate, 9MM barrel that I have shot another 200 down range with.) 

This gun has the manual safety but does not have the magazine disconnect safety, so it can discharge a round with the magazine removed and the manual safety disabled.

I am a huge fan of the M&P platform but I really want to get this very same model WITH the magazine disconnect.

I built this for the kids, and my wife to have something to shoot, but we don't make it to the farm often enough to justify keeping it around. This rifle has had about 120 rounds of .223, 40 rounds of 5.56 NATO, and 300 rounds of .22 through it.

Also has a Mako pistol grip, and mag well grip. The upper is from Del-Ton. Barrel is 1 in 9 twist, 5.56 chambered with M4 feed ramps. It has a quadrail handguard and removable rear sight, with LaRue index clips, and a Grip pod. Comes with  a UTG carry case, cheap one point sling, and a magazine with magpul anti-tilt follower.

I also have a .22 conversion kit with 3 black dog mags with stainless feed lips and a bulk pack of .22.

My price is pretty firm, I am only selling it because I have multiple 12 gauge shotguns and a 30-06 and another 30-30 (that I can hunt with). So there is no need for it to go to waste. I have yet to find another Marlin 30-30 on here for under $325. I may take trades, depending on what you have, but I do not want to trade my gun plus cash for what you have. Feel free to email me with any questions, and if looking to trade include some pictures for my viewing pleasure please. The gun will be available by mid to late next week, I just moved to Wilmington and it is still located at my fathers house near Raleigh so I need to have a day off of work to go get it. Gun is clean, not stolen, I can provide the serial number for verification if needed, and I will gladly write up a bill of sale for both of our protection for us both to sign.

Ok, starting with the round count looking at around 600. Really not a whole lot considering the years I've had it. Never ever fired cheap rounds (i.e: Wolf) only M855.

The rifle was one of the original ""SWAT"" models SIG first put out. However, I didn't care much for the Samson quad rail which made this rifle really front heavy and unbalanced.

To reduce the front weight I replaced the quad handguard rail with some Swiss polymer handguards. Because the gas system still made the front a little heavy I replaced the buttstock with something heavier, a magpul UBR. Although not needed because of the way the rifle works I put in a Wolf Tungten buffer tube inside the UBR buttstock (no maximize space and weight balance) What happened was a great weight rebalance with the rifle.

I added some other things to the rifle, including a Griffin charging handle which is canted downwards instead of upwards (so your hand isn't being obstructed by an optic), installed SIG Diopter iron sights and I have an aluminium strike plate installed on the UBR buttstock. Also installed the new top rail."

This gun cost me over $2500, and the Eotech setup was another $1000.  My loss is your gain.  I only put 1 mag through this gun- and I know everybody says that about their guns so don't believe me if you don't want to, but it's true.  One mag, 30 rounds, no exaggeration.  The gun is in pristine condition.  It has an Eotech 557 HWS with Eotech 3X FTS magnifier.  Magpul MIAD grip.  I also had a professional gunsmith tune the trigger because Scars come with a heavy, gritty trigger.  I am having an unexpected baby and I need to get rid of some toys.  Text me if you are serious and I can send you a pic.  REDACTED.  Cash please, no trades unless you have something really cool that I can't live without :) you never know - don't be afraid to ask!

The Forearm and Stock have been fitted to the gun. Needs final fitting, sanding, and finishing. The gun has about 75-80% blueing remaining, could be reblued or left as is. I have purchased all new screws for the gun, new buffer and rivet, new magazine cap, new friction ring. All parts are ready to be installed into the gun. My original plan was to send the gun off to have it reblued and have the wood professionaly finished but I do not have the funds to make this happen. The gun is all matching numbers and it has the rare solid rib barrel. Would make someone a nice gun but I just dont have the skill to do it myself. Would like to get $250 cash OBO.

We would love to keep them all but its just to much, we are asking a re-homing fee to recoup expenses. We do want try to make sure that anyone interested knows what they are getting as far as breed goes so we included a couple of breed links below, these are not fighting dogs, they are family dogs and can be tracking dogs if taught.
Black and Tan Coon Hound Mix puppies!!! Born 1/6/2012. 8 weeks old!! Mom is a Black and Tan Coon Hound (75 lbs). Dad is a mixed breed (50-60 lbs), probably black lab and shepherd. We were watching the dad for a friend of ours and thought our girl was out of heat. These pups are high energy, love to play and chase, romp, and wrestle. They also love to climb in your lab and cuddle. They are looking a lot like their mom. They come with first set of distemper, flu, and parvo shots, de-wormed, and they had their first vet visit with a clean bill of health. They each also have a collar, leash, and a small food supply. These puppies have been loved and cared for. They have been socialized, given regular cleanings, and lots of indoor and outdoor play time. They have interacted and are very good with other dogs, cats, small children, and they love everybody, and are happy to cuddle with you.

This bow is short 32"" and is fast (300 fps) and very forgiving due to a generous brace height. The only reason I am selling is due to the fact I broke my back in the Army and can't shoot anymore. I have all the paperwork/recipts where I purchased this bow brand new. It has a 28"" draw, 80% let-off, super nice mathews case ($175), stabilizer, trigger release (rope), mathews quiver, limb savers, tiger string, several arrows, sheath, and sevreal misc items it in the case. When I was not using the bow for more than a month or two it was unstrung to relieve the tension on the limbs. This bow has everything to shoot accept for the sight. I can't stress how nice this bow is. It is not scratched or beat up in anyway. I would be willing to accept all reasonable offers and trades. I really like military gear like surefire lights, pouches, etc. I would be VERY interested in trading for a 1911 in .22 caliber if anyone is interested. Thanks and GOD bless."

810,http://www.armslist.com/posts/323810,For Sale/Trade:  19' Open Bow Bayliner w/ 150 OB,"West Wichita, Wichita, Kansas","$ 1,800","Listed On: Friday, March 2, 2012",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm moving and need to get rid of my project boat.

It is a '86 19' open bow Bayliner with a 150 hp Mercury Black Max (Oil injected) outboard. The fiberglass is in good, floating condition. The motor is strong and the electric tilt works great. I currently have the motor winterized, but would get it going again upon a prospective buyer/trader's request.

Good:
Comes w/ a fully functional trailer
Fiberglass is good
Strong motor
Ski Pylon
Brand new life jackets
tubes / set of skis
Kenwood stereo
New carpet and vinyl come with the boat

The bad:
The trailer needs new lights / wiring. I'll give someone a set of magnetic lights that will get you where you need to go in the short term.
The interior is an underway process: I removed all of the seat and rotten wood and saturated foam in the aft hull compartments.
The foam was salvageable, but I do have another new foam roll.
I've cut out or traced all factory seat sizes and the new wood will come with the boat too. It isn't marine grade, but CDX that I have primed to seal.

Someone with a little know-how and time could get a great boat. I am not firm on the price. I bought the boat for $1900 and have over $600 in new carpet/vinyl/wood/accessories. I need it gone, so make me offers.

My 77"" x 10' utility trailer was stolen a few weeks ago. I would be willing to trade for a new utility trailer and I'm always interesting in boom sticks.

Anyway, the boat has to go, so please feel free to make an offer.

While I don't have the box, it is in NIB PRISTINE CONDITION and to the best of my knowledge has never been fired.  

It sports the stainless steel barrel and fixtures with the black laminate stock but appears as a deep forest/mossy green hardwood grained stock.

This model is of the second gen. M77 line which was retooled almost entirely and reintroduced in 1991 as the Mark II. The safety, bolt, and trigger were completely redesigned. The claw extractor was retained, but the bolt face was opened up to allow controlled-round feeding. And that is to name just a few major modifications to the original M77.  This line is now out of production as of 2006.  This rifle was build in 1996 according to its SN, yet remains in brand new condition!

Included in the purchase of this amazingly accurate rifle is a heavy leather  shoulder strap, a Bushnell Sportview 3X-9X/32 scope, trigger guard (lost key but easy to open without it), and a hard plastic carrying/storage case.
