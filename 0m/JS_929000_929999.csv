The AK-54R rifles are built upon Category 1 (nice, minty, un issued) Romanian PSL rifle parts kits, using a special receiver that allows for the use of regular AKM type butt stocks and pistol grips. They also feature a correct, and fully functional, scope mount, installed on the left side of the receiver . The barrel is shortened to 16.5 inches, and is re-profiled, allowing the gas block and handguard retainer to be moved rearward, so that standard AKM length gas pistons (we use a Tapco stainless unit, which provides an extra 922r compliance part) and standard AKM type handguards can be used! The idea is simply to give the end user an AKM sized package that delivers the powerful punch of the 7.62x54R cartridge. This initial batch of rifles will feature a non-pinned Romanian PSL muzzle device, on 14x1 LH threads, K-VAR synthetic furniture, in plum, beautiful gun kote finish ."

I have a Para Ordnance 1911 for sale. It is the Operation Iraqi Freedom edition that was only sold to soldiers serving in The Iraq War. Not many of these were made and even less are on the market. Most of them are still owned by soldiers. As far as I am aware this is also the only one on Armslist. It comes with 3 magazines and about 60 rounds of 45acp. I am taking offers and will also consider a SOCOM II or a M1A/M14 for trade. I also MIGHT take a CZ 75 in on trade. You can contact me on here or text me at 715-894-094zero. Please do not call before 3pm on weekdays. My name is Jon, thanks."

PMAG® 30 AR/M4 GEN M2 MOE® Window, 5.56x45 Magazine

Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) is a line of firearm accessories designed to provide a high-quality, economical alternative to standard weapon parts. The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality.

The PMAG 30 AR/M4 GEN M2 MOE Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M4 compatible magazine that offers a cost competitive upgrade from the aluminum USGI. It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

In addition, durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

The GEN M2 MOE is identical in form and function to the older model PMAG except that the optional Impact/Dust Cover is now sold separately.

Comes with two cylinders; one in .38-40 Winchester, and another in 10mm Auto. Wood Grain handle and blued finish. Discontinued manufacturing.


Unlike most other manufacturers, Ruger's 10mm is not a semiautomatic pistol. The Ruger Blackhawk ""Buckeye"" Convertible is a single-action revolver. Like all Ruger Blackhawks, this 10mm Auto version is strong and ultra-reliable. As this particular Blackhawk is a ""Convertible"" model it comes with a second cylinder in a different caliber. Both the 10mm Auto and the .38-40 Winchester use .400"" caliber projectiles and so either caliber can be fired down the Blackhawk's barrel by simply switching cylinders.

As already mentioned, Ruger's 10mm came in the form of it's popular single-action Blackhawk revolver. This was a run of 5,000 guns for Buckeye Sports Supply, and truth be told it wasn't actually a dedicated 10mm, but rather a dual-cylinder convertible with one cylinder in 10mm Auto and the other in .38-40 Winchester. Has the Buckeye flower rollstamp stamped on the topstrap.

The Huldra 5.56 Midlength Evo-Slank 14.5 Upper (Ultra Lite Piston Upper) is a .625"" lite profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The mid-length piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. With the combination of the .625 ultra lite pencil barrel, the Samson Evolution hand guard, and the new reduced radius permanently affixed flash hider, we now have the lightest dedicated piston upper on the market. With the patented Adams Arms piston system, you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler and longer than any other AR upper you own. Brand-New-In-Box

Deadly accurate at 200 yards and very effective up to 500 yards.

This is a complete Home Defense or Tactical Package.  The AR-15 semi-automatic rifle has a 16"" barrel with a A2 Birdcage flash-hider. The barrel is heavy duty chrome-lined that only a few manufacturers make.

Chrome-lined barrels are corrosion resistance and can endure much more the cheap DPMS, CMMG, YHM or other Remington products.

The A2 Flash hider can easily be removed and replaced with a Muzzle Brake to enhance accuracy after repeating firing. You can also replace the A2 Flash hider with a suppressor or silencer (If permitted by your state). This is a NEW and has all original paper work intact in the factory, Smith & Wesson box.

Bushnell, Firefield, Sightmark, Nikon, etc. I can boot the deal if you have something that is far more valuable than this barrel, but I'd prefer to keep it a straight trade.

If you're interested just shoot me an email with what you have along with pictures of the scope. Ill be sure to send pictures of my barrel too.

Brand New AR-15 upper half in the 5.56/223 caliber. This is is a complete rifle. The barrel is 16"" M4 profile with the 1-7 twist. The receiver on the upper half is made from the durable 7075 forging which is mil-spec. The rail system on this upper is a free float 10"" modular rail system which allows the shooter to move the rails where it best suits their needs and makes it easier to grip with the smaller diameter. 

These rifles have been modified so that they will fire the military ammo flawlessly or whatever you may decide to feed it. This upper is extremely heavy duty. 
The upper was built by Precision Arms International in Alabama.
The lower is extremely heavy duty also being a complete Rock River Arms lower with a 6 position stock. 

These two rifles have consecutive serial numbers from Rock River Arms and are identical.

I am selling these in Oklahoma City. I am pretty firm on the price asking $1900 each.

Figured I would throw this out there since I just put it on Craigslist too. This thing is bad-to-the-bone...and I should NOT be selling it prior to the the Superbowl. I'll probably hate myself if it sells before then. You have to come see this in person to believe it, some serious wow factor. Jaws drop whenever someone comes to my house and it's on.

Only a few months old and less than 100 hours on the lamp (good for 4000 hours). 25ft (yes, FEET) screen in HD...doesn't get any better, just be warned you won't want to look at another regular TV again...and you WILL be having the Superbowl party at your place!!

Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles."

I have a brand new DPMS LR-308 precision AR chambered in .308 up for sale or trade. Gun has a rifle length free float aluminum handguard and a heavy threaded barrel. This gun has only had two boxes fired through it and comes with the bipod, and the 6x18x44 scope pictured. Gun also has the soft case and all the paperwork it came with when I bought it as well as the factory magazine, I might even have a couple boxes of .308 left to throw in. This may be one of your last chances to get a .308 AR10 varient and especially in this condition! Most everyone is asking closer to $3000 for this rifle right now so I believe my asking price of $2500 OBO for trade on everything is decent. I will work with you on the price if you are wanting to buy it straight across with cash. I am looking to trade for a few things right now and they are as listed:
Full size or possibly compact Springfield XDM or XD in .40 or .45 + cash
Full size M&P in 9mm, .40 or .45 + cash
Full size Glock in 9mm, .40 or .45 + cash
1911 varient + cash
AK47 varient + cash
Nice bolt action rifle in 30 caliber or larger + cash
OR I AM WILLING TO TRADE STRAIGHT ACROSS for a motorcycle or 4x4 truck/SUV or a couple older dirt bikes.

I am willing to do more then one gun on trade to even out the price, but I do need some cash on this deal unless you have a streetbike, 4x4 truck/SUV or a couple dirt bikes then as I said I would trade you straight across. This post will remain up until the deal has been made on the DPMS at which point I will take it down so there is no need to ask if it is still available. Send me pics of what you are offering to trade or I won't respond to you, and please only serious offers or inquiries.

Trade value is $2500 OBO and I don't want any low ballers, if you wanna buy it straight across I will work with you on the price. Thank you."
