This is brand new and has never been fired.  I am also including a 12 gauge flare adapter (Retail $30).  The red piece that is pictured.  

The HAVOC launcher retails for $299.99 plus tx and shipping.

I have the original box and instructions.

I am looking to get $300.  Maybe open for trades on guns."

I would like to trade for a decent .223 or .308 hunting rifle with a decent scope. I would consider a 30-30 or 22's as partial trade. I am interested in 9mm's, Beretta 92, CZ 75,and Tanfoglio EAA Witness. If is't not on my wish list feel free to offer, worst I can do is say no thanks. All deals will require an AZ DL and signed bill of sale/trade. Thanks for looking.

Wish the grip had more texture?  Tired of stick on grip tape and rubber sleeves that will only end up failing? Not interested in changing the entire appearance of the weapon?  If so, here is your answer.

Using the factory back strap of your choice (S,M,L) I will add a textured ""scale-like"" pattern to it which will add the extra grip shooters need to help manage recoil.  

I will also add a textured pattern to the front strap of the weapon which provides a course grip giving the shooter more control of the weapon.

Variant 1 (DA/SA), manual safety and de-cocker.  You can also carry this cocked-and-locked like a 1911.   

The German marks are the ""DE"" and the Stag Antler markings.  You can see them in the pictures, though I have obscured part of the serial number in the pictures. This one is brand new and never fired or disassembled.  The new HKs are assembled in the US and the quality control, many say, is simply not the regimented and strict quality control of the German HK factory.

Comes with two 12 round magazines.  The new HKs ones you can buy will be the US-assembled ones so get one of the more rare full German ones, and for less.

Item/set-up was taken out of my Chevy Suburban. In Full working order with exception of a 12vdc neon tube inside the enclosure (can be replaced with ease and minimal cost). Also including remote Bass Boost module for the amp (lighted knob kind), - you will need a double mono 1/8 end cable to plug it in . As you see, there was no expense spared on this stereo (everything was purchased BRAND NEW), Amp was $800 shipped, Enclosure was $750+$150 shipping due to size/weight and capacitor was $200. So, not including all the terminals and wires, spare fuse and Bass Boost module This set-up was $1900. As you see from the pics, there are over $120 in wires and high end voltage distribution hardware. I ran this set-up via 0ga DC cables, second dedicated Optima Yellow Top Battery with upgraded to 130AMP Bosch alternator and Battery Isolator (none listed are included) as this is a power house and, obviously draws some juice. Capacitor helps big time, thus was added into the initial installation mix from the beginning and proved to be a huge value. Any questions, shoot me an email."

It was my first project rifle - I've replaced the stock with a Choate Dragunov stock with cheek rest, and drilled and tapped the receiver for a Choate scope mount. I've also removed some of the clunkier military features of the rifle - the bayonet, the grenade launcher sights, etc.

Included in the sale price is the rifle, scope (4x32 manufacturer unknown), sling, original fixed 10-round magazine, two Tapco 20-round magazines, cleaning rod, original cleaning kit and sight adjustment tool, and a Plano hard case for scoped rifles.

It has been a fun, cheap plinker - just needs a new home. I may take trade offers - let me know what you've got! Thanks for your interest!"

I bought this used back in December 2000, and haven't shot it since 2002 or 2003. 

It has Trijicon night sites, which are still glowing well enough to use, even though they're 10+ years old.

The case is marked 
220-45-K
P220-45 K, 2MAGS-7RD
I believe the ""K"" refers to Sig's K-Kote finish, although I'm not sure.

The finish shows some holster wear toward the muzzle end, but is in otherwise very good condition.

There is a piece of skateboard tape on the front grip. It was this way when I bought it.

The right side of the slide is marked ""P220. Made in Germany"" (not ""W. Germany""), and the left side is marked ""Sig Sauer. Sigarms Inc.. Exeter-NH""

There is no date or proof code. According to this internet forum thread, ""If your German made slide doesn't have the proof marks and date code that means that the gun was never assembled in Germany. It was imported to Exeter to be assembled at SIGARMS. All handguns that are made in Germany must be proofed and stamped. Your SIG's were proofed in the US. You can probably find a circle P stamped on your barrel. That is the US proof."" There is no circle P stamp on the barrel of this gun. I think they started doing that in 1995, so this gun would have been made between 1995 - 2000.

It has the American-style magazine release behind the trigger guard, not the European-style heel release.

For people who have asked, I am not willing to sell the guns without the extra magazines. The reason is simply that it would not be worth my time and effort to try to sell the magazines separately once the gun is sold. Now if somebody wants to buy the set of all four magazines separately for $140 before I sell the gun, then obviously I would lower the price of the gun. And no, I won't break up the set of magazines, again because it's not worth my time and effort to sell just one magazine. As noted above, they are available from CDNN. Besides, any serious handgunner should have as many magazines as possible, with 5 being a commonly recommended minimum. The reason for this is (1) be ready for any ""serious social purpose,"" and (2) so you can use your range/training time more efficiently by shooting, instead of reloading magazines (you do load your magazines before going to the range, right?) Remember that magazines are the weak-link in semi-auto firearms: they are the part most likely to get dropped, broken, bent, stepped on, etc. The more you have, the better.

The Colt Python Hunter was made only in 1980 and was the first field-ready handgun hunting package from a major handgun manufacturer.  Perhaps 2400 were produced.

Bench resting, on a sandbag, I have shot three inch groups of six rounds, using good ammunition and shooting very carefully.  Very very carefully.

This weapon has never been fired in anger, or in haste.  It has only been fired with care, and with love and with deep satisfaction.  Some will say that this is the BMW of the weapons from Colt.  Not true.  It is the Rolls Royce.  This is the finest revolver Colt ever produced.

This weapon is near to mint.  It has been shot, but it was perfectly maintained and is ready to become a part of the discriminating buyer’s collection.  This is a particularly fine weapon.  It’s the type of quality weapon that Thomas Crown would have and enjoy as part of his good life.  It’s one that the older Bond would appreciate and the newest Bond would kill for.  Oops.  Bad pun there.

This weapon is from my personal collection so there is no paperwork or sales tax.  It is an attempt to “thin out” what I own.  And perhaps to raise a little money for to spend.  Kind offers entertained and reasonable offers may be accepted.  

But, you must have a valid Arizona ID and be legally able and eligible to purchase one.  It is not suitable for mailing because of the extra fees involved, and because I want to sell only face to face and only here in Northwest Tucson or within some reasonable driving distance.

Cash (no checks, money orders, or stamps) is preferred, but interesting trades will be considered. I am seeking a short barreled 22 similar to the S&W model 36.  And who knows what else.  Please no leather, whips, chains, or teenage children.  Already have enough of those.  

Not incidentally, this weapon will never be listed on Ebay.  Or Craigslist.  Or be available at any of the Gun Shows because I don’t like the heat and dust and humility at the Pima County Fairgrounds."

Smooth operation with little to no marks or rust. Absolutely beautiful threads and shoots tight groups even with cheap surplus ammunition. Comes with bayonette, sling, cleaning kit, ammunition pouches, and 40 rounds of 182g. FMJ. In case you are unfamiliar with the round, the 7.62x54r is basically a .30 cal. Russian round with casing size in between a .308 and 30-06. With the power closer to the 30-06 and ballistics more similar to the .308. In other words, an incredibly versatile, accurate, and powerful round. Very capable of taking nearly if not all North American game with ease. Also i can give it a Duracoat job for another $100. Duracoat advertises and guarantees that it never wears. Only if you subject it to extreme shock and/or abrasives will it show wear. I would suggest tactical grey/green as it compliments the character of the rifle and is versatile in most environments."

It is an accurate, reliable 1911. It is pleasant to shoot, and although I don't have very many rounds through it, it ate them all up without a hitch. I don't really need to get rid of it but I have more handguns than I need right now and I prefer to shoot my cheaper 9mms, and I don't have a good rifle or shotgun anymore.
I also have a specific 1911 project in mind and I need a steel framed gun for that.

From MEC site: 

The MEC 650N gives maximum performance with a minimum of effort. It works on six shells at once. With every stroke, a reloaded shell is completed. The MEC 650N does not resize except as a separate operation. This is the ideal press for the person who wishes to resize and inspect their shells as a separate operation. The MEC SuperSizer is recommended to fill your resizing needs. 

The MEC 650N has three crimping stations. The first station starts the crimp. The second closes the crimp. And the third station places the taper on the shell that is so important for proper feeding in a pump or automatic.

Available in 12, 16, 20, 28 gauge, and .410 bore. Die sets are not available.

Minimum effort 
The Automatic Primer feed is standard. Fill with a full box of primers and the MEC 650N does the rest.

Now is your chance to get one at a very fair price.  (No, I'm not a firearms dealer.)

I'm selling this Auto Ordinance 1911.  It functions flawlessly (never a failure to feed or eject since I've owned it).  

So why so cheap?  The frame had some pits, that I filled in with Duracoat leveler, then I duracoated the entire firearm.  (Look up Lauer Duracoat if you don't know what the finish is.) I did not fill in the pit near the serial #, as I didn't want to get anywhere near it.  Also... I didn't take the advice of the gunsmith who put on the duracoat, and fired it before full cure (2 weeks), and some of the durracoat rubbed off on the hammer (see photo)... it is purely cosmetic though.

The price I'm asking reflects these very minor cosmetic defects.  You'll see from the photos that I'm trying my best to disclose these slight defects.

Why am I selling?  Because I finally bought myself a 1911 Kimber, and think this will just sit in my safe until I die.  (And I'm planning a trip to Vegas :)

This gun comes with 2 magazines, and plastic pistol box.

Please no lowball offers... I'm not going to sell you this for $150 because you are the first to respond, and as you shop around, you'll see the price is fair.

I'm also interested in fair trades.  Email me some proposals, and I'll get back to you (usually the same day)

This is a piston driven pistol, much like the Sig556 rifles and is alot easier to maintain than the AR DI rifles. Really cool firearm that has alot of umpph shooting the rifle ammo out of this. The fireball it shoots is insane in lowlight. This firearm has about 300rds through it.

This rifle is NEW IN BOX and comes in the original factory box with the serialized, owners manual packet.  

This is the very desirable, nearly impossible to find new, very limited edition Remington Model 700 200 year anniversary of Eliphalet Remington in 30-06 with a 22"" barrel made in 1993 and carefully vault stored ever since. The to celebrate the 200th Anniversary, Remington pulled out all the stops and fitted a collectors grade stock on this rifle in truly spectacular, ultra highly figured fiddleback maple finished in unstained natural maple high gloss finish with a Monte Carlo comb with raised cheekpiece, generous skip line cut checkering both on the pistol grip and for end, black caps on the for end, pistol grip and on the butt stock which wears the Remington logo. 

The pictures simply can't show the true beauty of the wood. The stock has a 3D, holographic effect to the exquisite fiddleback grain as you look at it from different angles. The rifle is factory drilled for scope mounts (I did install a weaver type mount off of another M700 BDL but never installed a scope) and is furnished with the factory sling swivel studs. Being a Model 700 BDL it has the factory Remington open sights installed with the front having a removable hood and the rear being adjustable for windage and elevation. The magazine has a hinged floor plate that has a gold filled etching paying homage the 200th anniversary of the company's founder and the metal work has a rich, deep blue gloss finish which looks superb with the gorgeous maple stock. Also, note that this rifle does NOT have the silly locking bolt shroud as some later 700's do. As you would expect on a NIB rifle there is no wear on the bolt face.

 The rifle is listed elsewhere at a fixed price.

Shipping is $40.00 to your FFL to the lower 47 (Sorry, I DO NOT ship to California) states. Ak and Hi will be higher and I will only ship to the 49 US states, no exceptions what so ever. I am an individual, not a dealer so be sure your FFL accepts shipments from individuals. If your ffl requires shipments from another FFL holder that will cost extra and contact me first to find out how much extra. I highly recommend insurance (additional approximately $.75 per thousand of value) for this item. The rifle will be very securely packaged.

You are responsible for checking as to whether this gun is legal in your state or locality! I will ship ONLY to your FFL and require a signed in ink copy of your receiving FFL's holders license. No exceptions. 

I am open to the possibility of a face to face sale to a bonafide Arkansas resident to save you on shipping. I also believe in describing an item accurately, pretty easy to do with a new rifle... Feel free to check my feedback on ebay (handle- achildofthesky), 24 hour campfire, Marlin Owners, The High Road (THR), gunbroker, arguntrader. I am an individual and not a dealer or business and because of this, the gun is sold with out warranties of any type on my part and all sales are final. That said, if you have been looking for a new in box example of these exceptionally beautiful and VERY rare rifles, you will not be dissapointed with this one. Thanks for looking and good luck bidding.

I have a couple of other guns and some ammo I will be listing in the coming weeks to further fund unforeseen medical expenses. Thanks for looking and be safe."

Stoeger 2000, semi-auto, inertia driven, 12 gauge. 2 3/4"" or 3"" shells. 28"" vent rib barrel with fiber optic front sight. Has Limbsaver recoil pad installed. Comes with several choke tubes (takes Beretta choke tubes, so they are easy to find everywhere). I have the original box and paperwork. I have put thousands of rounds through this thing (mostly at Colorado Clays) and have only had three minor ejection issues in those thousands of rounds and those were ammunition related. I cleaned and lubed it after every 100 rounds or so.

Length: 260 mm
Barrel length: 127 mm
Capacity: 6 rounds



This revolver was developed at the Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield in 1926 - 1927. The design is based on scaled down Webley Mark 6 ""break-top"" frame, with cylinder chambered for 6 .38/200 rounds. The hammer/trigger group was redesigned, with manual hammer safety lock added, and with separate cylinder lock. This revolver was adopted for British Military service in 1932 as Enfield revolver, .38 caliber, No.2 Mark 1. After 1938, almost all No.2 Mk1s were converted into No.2 Mark 1* configuration.

Enfield No.2 Mark 1* were developed in the late 1930s for British Tank Corps, and are distinguished from early Mark 1 by spurless, Double Action Only hammers, lighter mainsprings, and re-shaped grip side plates. The spurless DAO hammers were required by Tank Corps command to avoid snagging the hammers on tank internals.

Enfield No.2 Mark 1** appeared in the 1942 as a simplified, wartime design. These guns were similar to No.2 Mark 1*, but withouth the hammer stop. After the 1945, all those revolvers were recalled and converted into No.2 Mark 1* configuration."
