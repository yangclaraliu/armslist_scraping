I used a Spikes Tactical Zombie Lower with a DPMS parts kit. I replaced the stock grip with a Magpul MIAD Grip and I installed a standard A2 Butt Stock with an internal storage compartment. The Buffer also has some wadding stuffed inside with the weights to keep rattling down. This lower was then mated to a Bravo Company Mid-Length Upper with a 1:7"", chrome lined, Magnetic Particle tested barrel, fitted with a standard A2 Bird Cage Flash Hider. Inside the upper is a Bravo Company Bolt Carrier with a CMMG bolt and pin which is also MP tested. Then I added the Magpul Mid Length MOE Handguard which comes with three rails. A 5 slot on the front bottom which is holding the Harris Bi-Pod via a MAKO bi-pod adapter, a 9 slot rail at the rear holding the EMA Vertical Fore Grip (w/ battery storage) and an empty 9 slot at the 2 O'Clock position available for a light or laser etc.
The Bi-Pod has a canting feature making it easier to shoot on uneven ground and is spring loaded. Adjustable form 9 to 13 inches. 
The scope is an Accu Shot made by Leapers. It is 3-12 x 44mm and has an illuminated reticle. An extra battery is included as well as a color wheel chart as you can scroll through all the colors of the spectrum (Fun!). It comes mounted with low rings and flip up caps.
With this package, I will include the MIAD Grip accessories, a couple papers for the scope and bi-pod, TWO Magpul 20 round PMAG magazines and a Blackhawk 3-Point Universal SWIFT Sling that comes with various attachment options. 

This AR15 was just built and I have not fired any rounds through it as I want to keep it in brand new condition. Yes, that means you will have to zero it but I'm sure most won't complain. 
And please take into consideration manual labor, shipping costs, time, love and finesse with the price tag. Thank You!"

Looking to sell my good old SKS!
She fires true and I love the gun, but I live in the city and will be moving soon and don't need to take her with me. 
As stated, this is the NATO style Yugoslavian SKS. It fires 7.62 x 39mm rounds. It has a foldable bayonet and also a 22mm grenade launcher barrel attachment. (This shoots old style grenades, not the standard 40mm shot today.) It is gas operated,semi-automatic, and does have the sites attached for the grenade launcher. It includes a stock wrap that holds 20 bullets. The banana clip is not the standard internal magazine and does detach. It is a 15 shot clip. 
Gun has been cleaned once and has mainly sat since. Shot multiple times but not often. She is a well made, well-greased, older, quality weapon that shoots accurately with almost no recoil. 
In the back of the barrel is a circle you can put your finger into with a spring inside. These guns have a special cleaning kit you can put into this spring-loaded storage area. Very-handy, but I do not have the kit unfortunately.

If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.""

""The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech® system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that’s more than a pound less! The ComforTech® system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest shooting and most reliable shotgun ever.""

Comes with case, manual, breech lock, and two magazines, just like it came from the factory.  The only reason I'm selling it is because I have a new higher capacity home defense pistol on order and need the bucks to pick it up.  

This is the 3.9"" barreled version of the Sig P220.  8+1 capacity.  Night Sights.  Short reset trigger.  Sig Thin Grips.  The actual model number on the box is 220R-45-BSS.  If you Google that model number, you'll get more information on the pistol and see that my asking price of $685 is $100 less than the cheapest new price.  Most retailers are asking fm $800-850 for this model.  I'm also including a new box (20) of Hornady Critical Defense .45 ACP ammo.  That's another $20 at least you don't have to spend.

This is a superb hunk of lead tossing perfection, but the wife says my new gun I have ordered has to be a zero-sum transaction, which basically means that I have to come up with the bucks myself to buy it.  Don't let my married-with-no-spine status put you off, though.  My loss is your gain.  

$685 is what I'm asking.  I don't have too much wiggle room due to the previously mentioned zero-sum spousal mandate.  Face-to-face sale to Washington residents only.  I'm in Vancouver, but would consider meeting you a reasonable distance away to do the transfer.  If you're in Oregon, the sale/shipment has to go through an FFL.  Don't let that stop you Oregonians, though.  If you haven't done it before, just know that it really isn't that much hassle and is pretty cheap, certainly worth the effort for the right gun.  To ease the pain, I'll consider taking $25 off for Oregon residents to cover part of the transfer cost."

In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92 and 99 9mm pistols. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 and in adjustable sight model 99, you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

Loaded Chamber Indicator Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

3 Position Safety Decocker Try the ambidextrous Three-Position Safety on any Taurus pistol capable of firing in both single action and double action. It's easily operated and provided at no additional charge. Depress with your thumb and safely drop the hammer to de-cock the pistol. The safety returns to the OFF position, ready for double action shooting. Push the safety up and your cocked pistol is safe to carry in the single action mode. When applied to a de-cocked pistol, safety is ON and the first shot is double action.

In good shape, only taken to the range a couple of times.  I got it on trade to play around with but am now ready to sell and am looking for cash only.  The decocker sticks but who really cares about a decocker on a 22 with an external hammer anyways? ha Probably an easy fix but I'm not savvy enough to try.  Shoots great, and VERY accurate with a ""real"" gun feel to it that you don't get with a lot of 22 handguns.

Up for sale is my virtually new Saiga 12ga semi-auto shotgun with 2 original 5rd mags and a padded hard rifle case.  I've put maybe 50 rounds through this, and then found a great deal on a fully tricked out Saiga 12 with a couple of drum mags and other goodies, so this one needs to go.

Weapon is in like new condition and functions flawlessly.  Was cleaned after the only range trip I took (putting the 50 aforementioned rounds through it) and put back in the case.  It's a stock Saiga that I was going to tac out, but found the other one fully tricked and that was that.

The other mag is at my work so I couldn't get it into the picture. Also included in this package is a full box of WWB 100rd. Also I will have a mag loaded with Golden Saper HP's for self defense (6+1). $275 firm"

Selling my like-new .45 ACP Sig P220 Carry, approximately 300 rounds through it, pristine, cleaned religiously after each time to the range. Comes with case, manual, breech lock, and two magazines, just like it came from the factory. The only reason I'm selling it is because I have a new higher capacity home defense pistol on order and need the bucks to pick it up. 

This is the 3.9"" barreled version of the Sig P220. 8+1 capacity. Night Sights. Short reset trigger. Sig Thin Grips. The actual model number on the box is 220R-45-BSS. If you Google that model number, you'll get more information on the pistol and see that my asking price of $685 is $100 less than the cheapest new price. Most retailers are asking fm $800-850 for this model. I'm also including a new box (20) of Hornady Critical Defense .45 ACP ammo. That's another $20 at least you don't have to spend.

This is a superb hunk of lead tossing perfection, but the wife says my new gun I have ordered has to be a zero-sum transaction, which basically means that I have to come up with the bucks myself to buy it. Don't let my married-with-no-spine status put you off, though. My loss is your gain. 

$685 is what I'm asking. I don't have too much wiggle room due to the previously mentioned zero-sum spousal mandate. Face-to-face sale to Washington residents only. I'm in Vancouver, but would consider meeting you a reasonable distance away to do the transfer. If you're in Oregon, the sale/shipment has to go through an FFL. Don't let that stop you Oregonians, though. If you haven't done it before, just know that it really isn't that much hassle and is pretty cheap, certainly worth the effort for the right gun. To ease the pain, I'll consider taking $25 off for Oregon residents to cover part of the transfer cost."

I purchased it a few months back in preparation for Wisconsin getting concealed carry. However, I have decided to go a different direction, so this is up for sale. 

The gun has approximately 30 rounds through it, and is in great shape. It has functioned flawlessly. It has never actually been carried. It also comes with a crossbreed supertuck holster, which has never been used. The holster is made to be used with the Crimson Trace laser grips, which I never purchased. It comes with everything that came with it new, which is basically the manuals, trigger lock, case, and 1 magazine. I also added a Hogue grip to it - and cut out a square piece where the laser grip goes (My buddy has the same gun w/laser, so I tried it on mine). If you don't want to buy a laser, you can use the holster as is (it's a bit loose, but still works), or you can send it back to Crossbreed and they will change out the kydex for a fee.

Paid 400 for the gun, and 70 for the holster. I will sell both of them for 425."

It has screw in chokes, of which 3 are included. This shotgun is basically in MINT condition. It has a very ""grippy"" stock, that would be great for duck hunting, or conditions where it might get wet or damp.

I recently purchased this as a replacement for my old Benelli SL80 - which had trouble feeding 3"" shells. Unfortunately, I don't shoot nearly as well with this shotgun, so I'm going to try to find a Benelli M1 or M2 to replace this one.

You aren't going to find a nicer Semi-auto 12 gauge than this one for the money. She's a gas operated beauty, that has worked flawlessly over the 150 or so rounds I have put through it. This is also a great shotgun for lefties - as you can flip the safety around, so that it is on the other side (I actually did this already, I shoot lefty. If you want, I can flip it back if you purchase it).

I will sell it for $600.00. Thanks!"

I was looking around the site and found what the 1911 did looked like starting out. The difference is that mine does not have the lanyard loop on the mainspring housing (I had it replaced with a slim housing), the trigger (mine has the three hole), hammer (mine has skeleton) and the beavertail (mine turns up and is longer), the picture of this one does not have the ejection port flared or lowered. The barrel was already throated but the gunsmith enlarged it more and polished the throat and the ramp. Before taking it to the gunsmith I tried to chamber a winchester ranger le 230gr t-series round and it would not go at all but after getting it back I tried it again and it is night and day difference and the trigger pull is super sweet. There has been 100rd fired with no problems. I hope this may help give an ideal of what it looks like and will also try to find a way to post a picture of the the gun. Again this picture is only for reference of what the 1911 looked like before the upgrades."

I've owned the rifle for under ten years, fired just enough ammo to sight it in, and its been in storage ever since. The catch is there is a crack to the synthetic stock (fixed up with epoxy) and the butt pad is missing, as should be visible in the not-so-great photos.

This would be a real problem on a centerfire rifle, for a .22 its more a matter of looks, works fine as it is, you could improvise another cheap fix, or spend a few bucks prettying it up. The rifle is in otherwise excellent mechanical and cosmetic condition.

I am moving on monday and I'm not sure its worth the trouble to fly with a .22 rifle, I am willing to entertain all offers esp. trades for SMALLER guns (.22 pistols, derringers, etc.), knives,.40 cal ammo, or stuff that will be useful to me when I'm moving - I'm thinking luggage but who knows what else I might need.

Things I would consider in partial trade are Glock 19/23 factory magazines, 357SIG barrel for a G23, or a 9mm conversion barrel for the G23. However I would prefer cash and face to face. I travel up to Lake county fairly often"

decided to take it to range, and get some footage through my shooting glasses, to show how it handles.
