4x magnification 
Generation 3

 The pilkington kite is known in the British army as CWS common weapon sight. In the USA they are made under the name by Raptor. SA80 rail mount on it. I do have a weaver adapter that slides into the sa80 rail so it can be mounted on a weaver or picatinny. This adapter isn't the greatest but it works. You can purchase the newer rail adapter that will replace the sa80 rail. The night sight is amazing at night and is in great working order. The parallax is really smooth when your adjusting the focus. I believe these are set up for 100m-300m... It takes 2 AA batteries 
In service in over 50 countries.
Pilkington's were made in the early 90's and bought out by qioptiq which has been bought out by some other company I think Thales .

Anyways here's some info from qioptiq 
http://www.qioptiq.com/download/Qioptiq_KITE_Nov2011.pdf

It has a illuminated reticle kind of like a upside down chevron sight with a line on the top and a dot in the center that is used for day and night time use.

Used they sell for $4000-$4300 if you can find one.

Hunting season is right around the corner!  I've got this really nice Browning A-Bolt Stainless Stalker chambered in .338 WinMag up for sale.  It has a custom muzzle break, and a very nice trigger job that measures at about 2.5 pounds.  Breaks like glass.  The action is smooth and the rifle has a low round count as it was only used for hunting.  It is a stainless steel receiver and barrel, with black composite stock.  It comes with a Burris Fullfield 3-9x40 scope, sling, and soft case.

80,http://www.armslist.com/posts/525080,For Sale/Trade:  Vintage Allen Compound Bow- NEVER BEEN SHOT,"3 miles N of Jantzen Beach in Vancouver, Portland, Oregon",$ 125,"Listed On: Saturday, November 17, 2012",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a beautiful Vintage Wooden Compound Bow. The label say Fasco Compound Bow. From what I have found through research is that this is an Allen Bow made for Fasco. Holless Wilbur Allen patented the compound bow in 1969 and this is a very early model if not the first model. It was built sometime between 1969-1973. This bow has never been shot, taken to the woods, etc... The metal pieces to adjust the cables still have the ""plastic wrapper like piece"" that would have been on it when purchased. Their are identifying marks that seem to be a hand engraved that say 355-10 in two spots underneath the black metal pieces that are attached to the red piece of wood. And then there is a long hand engraved serial & maybe even model # and I think even some technical specs. Its on one of the two big black metal pieces of the bow. 

I have seen a couple pictures of an old Allen Bow that doesn't say Fasco anywhere on it but does say Allen Bow Co. and the long strings of #s, letters, etc. are hand engraved on that bow the same as it is engraved on this bow.

THIS BOW HAS NEVER BEEN SHOT

Holless Wilbur Allen developed the compound bow in 1966 ant the patent was granted in 1969 The best estimate of when this bow was built is between 1969-1973 which is the first couple years when the compound bow was being built. My estimate is based  off several things. 
1.) When my dad thinks he remembers buying it, and 
2.) The dates other people with Allen original's that look identical (different colors but same parts, etc..) say their bows were built.
3.) The Kluson Deluxe ""tuners"" I am not sure what they are called on bows but this bow has two of these and they are used to adjust the cables. They say Kluson Deluxe, which I looked up on google and they are tuners you find on old Fender and Gibson guitars. I found a series of pictures that dates when the tuners were made and the two on this bow look like the model they made from 1964-1967. Also I believe the company went out of business in 73'. 

The bow is in immaculate condition for any age, but especially for something 40 years old. This has never been refinished or anything, 100% original.  AND THIS BOW HAS NEVER BEEN SHOT, USED OR TAKEN INTO THE WOODS EVEN.

The only thing left original on it is the receiver. I target shoot, hunt and do a little run and gun with some friends pretty often and this is a do it all 10/22. I installed a Kidd trigger,hammer,seer,bolt, bolt buffer, cocking assembly with a subsonic spring. I polished the inside of the receiver. I installed a Tactical solutions 16.5"" threaded barrel with a compensator. It has troy t22 stock with a 4 rail hand guard. Burris bi pod with a quick connect attachment, UGI 1"" quick connect scope rings and a Mueller 8.5-25×44AO Tactical Scope (It is currently on my old savage model 10 right now). After sighting it in it will keep a 3.5 inch group at 200 yards and this setup works well for rabbits and prairie dogs or any other pest on the farm. For run and gun I take off the bi pod and add a forgrip.I replace the scope with a Primary arms micro red dot and a Troy single point sling. The final and by far the most entertaining addition is the slide fire stock. it will not work with a stock trigger but with the trigger job it works flawlessly. I would also include 3 bx-25 magazines, 2 10 round ruger magazines, soft case,and all the original parts.  So I know I have invested around $1700 in this gun and i would never expect to get that back but don't low ball me.  Email me and ill get back to you as soon as i can.

I have decided to get rid of a chunk out of my coin collection. Most of them are silver, but some are just rare and pretty cool. I am looking for a trade or partial trade.

I would consider trading for any 1911 (i really like nighthawk, kimber, para, colt, springfield, wilson, dan wesson), beretta 92s, ar-15, ak-47, norinco sks, marlin .22 or .45, any glock, luger, browning hi-power 9m, desert eagle, taurus judge, ruger mini 14, heckler and koch, Benelli Super Black Eagle, or cool knives. I would be willing to listen to just about any reasonable trade.

Silver:

1988 S Morgan Silver Dollar- The Morgan silver dollar is probably the most notable coin in American histroy. The official silver bullion coin of the United States is made of 99.9% pure silver and is worth ~$28 (today) melted down. The most expensive silver coin ever sold was a 1893 S Morgan Silver Dollar which sold for $502,000. This coin is in really good condition. This coin is in ""fine"" condition and would make an excellent addition to any connosieur's collection.

1923 S Liberty Peace Dollar- This is a beautiful coin with almost no wear at all! This coin is in ""extremely fine"" condition. The Liberty Peace dollar was minted between 1921-1935. In ""perfect"" condition, this coin is valued at $8,250.

1912 S Barber Half Dollar- The details on the face of this coin is slightly worn, but every other part of the coin is in ""fine"" shape. All of the writing on the coin stands out and is able to be read perfectly. In ""perfect"" condition, this coin can go for as much as $1,150.

1963 D Franklin Half Dollar- 1963 was the last year that they minted this coin in honor of a true American hero. The short production length was due to the assassination of John F Kennedy who replaced Franklin on the coin. This coin is in ""fine"" shape; this coin in ""perfect"" condition would go for up to $200.

1964 Kennedy Half Dollar (2) This coin was first minted in 1964 and is still the fifty cent piece issued by the US mint. One of the coins is in ""extremely fine"" condition, the other is in ""fine"" condition.

1943 Liberty Half Dollar- This is a beautiful coin in ""fine"" condition. In ""perfect"" condition, this coin would go for about $100.

1943 Washington Quarter- This coin would probably be considered in ""poor"" condition, although every image and letter is definitely readable. This coin represents a monumental point in American history.

1899 P Liberty Barber Quarter- The front of this coin is in ""good"" condition, and the back of the coin is in ""extremely fine"" condition. The fact that this coin has no print indicates that it was minted in Philadelphia. In ""perfect"" condition, this coin would be valued at $475.

1927 S Standing Liberty Quarter- Only 2% of the standing liberty quarters of this time period were minted in San Fransisco making it the rarest and most valuable quarters of the era, and this coin in ""perfect"" condition would be valued at $7,250. This coin is in ""good"" condition 

1943 W Mercury Dime- This is a unique piece of American history featuring one of the only coins to feature a Roman God. This was one of the last years the Mercury Dime was minted. The back of this coin is in ""extremely fine"" condition and the head is in ""fine"" condition. This coin in ""perfect"" condition is valued at $30.

1947 Roosevelt Dime- The Roosevelt Dime was minted after his death and has continued until present day. This dime is in ""extremely fine"" condition and in ""perfect"" condition, this coin is valued at $17.

1902 Barber Liberty Dime- This coin has no mint mark, making it much less rare than the Barber Dime printed in San Fransisco. This coin is in ""fair"" condition; in ""perfect"" condition, this coin is valued at $179.


not silver:

1937 Buffalo Nickel- This is one of the last years that the Buffalo Nickels were minted. This coin is in ""extremely fine"" condition; this coin in ""perfect"" condition goes for about $53.


1905 Liberty Head V Nickel- This coin is in ""good"" condition considering it was minted over a century ago! In ""perfect"" condition, this coin would be valued at about $135.

1883 Indian Head Penny- This penny is the oldest in the collection. It is in ""extremely fine"" condition, which gives it a value of approximately $17. This coin is cool and hard to find.

1943 Steel Penny- This penny is in ""fine"" condition and has been banged up slightly around the edges but shows no fading. These are not nearly as valuable as the other coins (about $10 in ""perfect"" condition), but this represents a vital piece of American history.

I also have 13 1976 bicentennial quarters that are all in ""fine""-""extremely fine"" condition."

I have decided to get rid of a chunk out of my coin collection. Most of them are silver, but some are just rare and pretty cool. I am looking for a trade or partial trade.

I would consider trading for any 1911 (i really like nighthawk, kimber, para, colt, springfield, wilson, dan wesson), beretta 92s, ar-15, ak-47, norinco sks, marlin .22 or .45, any glock, luger, browning hi-power 9m, desert eagle, taurus judge, ruger mini 14, heckler and koch, Benelli Super Black Eagle, or cool knives. I would be willing to listen to just about any reasonable trade.

Contact me via email or call/text me at 205-nine0three-9791



Silver:

1988 S Morgan Silver Dollar- The Morgan silver dollar is probably the most notable coin in American histroy. The official silver bullion coin of the United States is made of 99.9% pure silver and is worth ~$28 (today) melted down. The most expensive silver coin ever sold was a 1893 S Morgan Silver Dollar which sold for $502,000. This coin is in really good condition. This coin is in ""fine"" condition and would make an excellent addition to any connosieur's collection.

1923 S Liberty Peace Dollar- This is a beautiful coin with almost no wear at all! This coin is in ""extremely fine"" condition. The Liberty Peace dollar was minted between 1921-1935. In ""perfect"" condition, this coin is valued at $8,250.

1912 S Barber Half Dollar- The details on the face of this coin is slightly worn, but every other part of the coin is in ""fine"" shape. All of the writing on the coin stands out and is able to be read perfectly. In ""perfect"" condition, this coin can go for as much as $1,150.

1963 D Franklin Half Dollar- 1963 was the last year that they minted this coin in honor of a true American hero. The short production length was due to the assassination of John F Kennedy who replaced Franklin on the coin. This coin is in ""fine"" shape; this coin in ""perfect"" condition would go for up to $200.

1964 Kennedy Half Dollar (2) This coin was first minted in 1964 and is still the fifty cent piece issued by the US mint. One of the coins is in ""extremely fine"" condition, the other is in ""fine"" condition.

1943 Liberty Half Dollar- This is a beautiful coin in ""fine"" condition. In ""perfect"" condition, this coin would go for about $100.

1943 Washington Quarter- This coin would probably be considered in ""poor"" condition, although every image and letter is definitely readable. This coin represents a monumental point in American history.

1899 P Liberty Barber Quarter- The front of this coin is in ""good"" condition, and the back of the coin is in ""extremely fine"" condition. The fact that this coin has no print indicates that it was minted in Philadelphia. In ""perfect"" condition, this coin would be valued at $475.

1927 S Standing Liberty Quarter- Only 2% of the standing liberty quarters of this time period were minted in San Fransisco making it the rarest and most valuable quarters of the era, and this coin in ""perfect"" condition would be valued at $7,250. This coin is in ""good"" condition 

1943 W Mercury Dime- This is a unique piece of American history featuring one of the only coins to feature a Roman God. This was one of the last years the Mercury Dime was minted. The back of this coin is in ""extremely fine"" condition and the head is in ""fine"" condition. This coin in ""perfect"" condition is valued at $30.

1947 Roosevelt Dime- The Roosevelt Dime was minted after his death and has continued until present day. This dime is in ""extremely fine"" condition and in ""perfect"" condition, this coin is valued at $17.

1902 Barber Liberty Dime- This coin has no mint mark, making it much less rare than the Barber Dime printed in San Fransisco. This coin is in ""fair"" condition; in ""perfect"" condition, this coin is valued at $179.


not silver:

1937 Buffalo Nickel- This is one of the last years that the Buffalo Nickels were minted. This coin is in ""extremely fine"" condition; this coin in ""perfect"" condition goes for about $53.


1905 Liberty Head V Nickel- This coin is in ""good"" condition considering it was minted over a century ago! In ""perfect"" condition, this coin would be valued at about $135.

1883 Indian Head Penny- This penny is the oldest in the collection. It is in ""extremely fine"" condition, which gives it a value of approximately $17. This coin is cool and hard to find.

1943 Steel Penny- This penny is in ""fine"" condition and has been banged up slightly around the edges but shows no fading. These are not nearly as valuable as the other coins (about $10 in ""perfect"" condition), but this represents a vital piece of American history.

I also have 13 1976 bicentennial quarters that are all in ""fine""-""extremely fine"" condition."

It has barely been fired and comes with everything that it would include if bought new. Two 17rnd mags, two keys for the integral lock, case, and paperwork. I am the original owner.

Although this is the 'full size' Steyr pistol, I would consider it closer in size to, say, a Glock 19, as opposed to a 17. And quite frankly, I think it's better in every way. More than anything, two things stick out: the grip is more ergonomic and comfortable, and the trigger is phenomenally better than any other DAO I have fired. It honestly feels like a single action, with a nice crisp break. Glocks are good guns, to be sure, but their mushy-feeling triggers just do not compare.

This is a later model M9A1, as evidenced by the pin below the rear sight and the lack of a loaded chamber indicator on the rear of the slide. The earlier versions got a bit of a bad rap; the trigger did not have the same feel, and the extractor was a little weak. This gun does not have those issues.

I can't point you to any articles where someone has buried this gun in mud, or dragged it behind their truck, or dropped it from a plane (for Glocks, these do exist). But as far as the experience of actually firing the weapon- I favor this gun, hands down. As far as durability under conditions of absurd neglect...I don't think anyone has studied that one yet. This particular one has certainly not been neglected, and has had zero malfunctions.

I am asking $450 OBO. I don't think you can buy a new one for under 500 (plus tax and background check). Bud's has them at 550. Serious offers only, please.

I wanted to add that this is a legit import of the latest US version of the M9A1. It would appear the earlier ones, which were available a little cheaper and got mixed reviews, were 'grey market' imports, in addition to lacking some of the current revisions. I do not think Steyr will even service them. So buyer beware if you see one of these offered with the earlier markings (and lacking that little roll pin underneath the rear sight)."

The flagship feature of the Jimenez Arms J.A. Nine is its easy to use massive screw adjustable rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation. Other, higher priced, pistols do not offer this kind of flexibility. The high visibility front sight is another great feature which adds to a highly effective sight pattern. These features coupled with a last round slide hold open makes this pistol uncommonly accurate and a delight at the range.

JIMENEZ   J.A. 380,  380mm  comes with 2 mags
The Jimenez Arms J.A. .380 is quite possibly one of the simplest, easiest to use and most comfortable compact .380's on the market today. Jimenez Arms includes such features as: a comfortable stance and an extended finger rest located at the bottom of the magazine. Other manufacturers offer this feature only on specialty clips at higher prices. Jimenez Arms, however, includes this feature at no extra cost. If you're in the market for a compact .380 and price, accuracy and comfort is a factor- the Jimenez Arms J.A. 380 is your solution."

I bought it less than three years ago, replaced all fluids (engine / gear oil), put a new battery in it, and so forth.  

I've ridden it a couple of times each season, but I just don't have the time to use it now, and need the garage space back.

Plastics are 100% with no cracks.  It has a ball hitch on it for towing wagons, moving boats, etc.  Maxxis tires look practically new.  Seat is perfect.  Starts right up, doesn't smoke, and runs like a beast.

Uses Yamaha's rock-solid manual 5-speed with automatic clutch.  

What I'm asking is below average retail, according to N.A.D.A value of $1745 on this 2000 model.

May be interested in trade, so e-mail me your idea - worst I can say is ""no thank you"".

It has a clear Ohio title.

If you're interested, it's a good idea to buy one before fall - at that point, the prices go up.

Serious inquiries only please.

Think Ruger Single Six quality with a 10 round capacity and updated sights.

I've installed a scope mount  but it can easily be removed to allow the rear Williams Fire optic, adjustable sight to be reinstalled.  Easily can do this with a few basic tools in less than 5 minutes.  

The Single Tens are selling locally for $500 plus tax ($37.5) without the optics mount ($40).  The cheapest I've found them online, without mount, is roughly $510 OTD including FFL transfer.  It would be $550 with mount.

Rabbits w/2,3/4in # 6&7.  Son got a Turkey w/#4 shot.  Very accurate to have just a bead for sight.

The Range Officer is a Gov't size 1911 chambered in .45 ACP with a 5"" barrel.  It has a parkerized finish and comes with all original Cocobolo wood grips, factory box, paperwork, 2 - 7rd (std) metal magazines, ILS key and adjustable rear target sight.  I painted the front sight with red nail polish and you might like it ( I do) or you can just take it off with polish remover.  I think it's easier to pick up with red.

It comes with a lifetime warranty from Springfield and that warranty will go with the gun.

The gun is nearly as it was when I bought it a year ago.  If you are looking for a ""like new"", used 1911,... this is the one you want.

I don't want to sell it but my wife got her concealed carry license and I am using this sale to buy her carry gun.

Price is $750 FTF, cash only.

I am not looking to trade unless you have the specific gun I am looking for.  A S&W model 632 Pro, chambered in .32 Federal Magnum.  That is the ONLY gun I would consider towards a trade.

Colt M4 Commando is the most compact of the Colt 5.56mm Family of Weapons featuring a 4-position sliding buttstock and an 11.5"" (29.2 cm) long barrel. The M4 Commando is famous for its lightweight, ease of handling, accuracy and reliability, qualities that make it a valid choice for a wide variety of law enforcement applications. In fact, the Colt M4 Commando is often chosen over smaller, less powerful sub-machine guns, allowing for full 5.56mm power and accuracy, in a sub-machine gun size weapon."

The truck was my daily driver for a couple of years until I bought something bigger so it's time for it to go to a good home. The truck is pretty clean with a few small used vehicle dings and very minor rust around the wheel wells. The interior is in great condition and was never smoked in. The exterior is very clean for a vehicle of this age, especially a Toyota pickup. The truck has manual windows and locks. The heat works and the air conditioning actually works too and blows ice cold. Has the original am/fm radio with cassette player. The truck has locking hubs and the 4wd engages flawlessly. The bed has a Bodygard bedliner. The truck has about 40% rubber left on Goodride Radial M/S 31x10.5x15's with black American Racing steel wheels. The tires need balanced. The oil was changed at regular 3,000 mile intervals. The truck will come with a service manual, owner's manual and an oil filter. Here's the deal with the truck it starts and runs but I think there is a problem with either the fuel pump or idle air control valve. Sometimes it will drive fine for 30+ miles and other times it will stall when coming to a stop. Also sometimes it surges when under throttle and feels like you are giving it gas but it won't go. It can be driven home or to a shop to be worked on . It also has a power steering fluid leak. I had this for sale a few months ago when it was running fine and was getting offers of $2500-$2600 but I'm sick and tired of messing with it and I want it gone. The best offer at or over $1800 can have it. I'll entertain offers for about a week and if someone comes up with the cash it's theirs. Within the past 2 years I replaced or fixed the following (have some receipts):

-brakes and rotors
-frame welded in a few spots
-exhaust
-battery (5/6/12) 
-throttle position sensor
-O2 sensor (4/28/11)
-spark plugs (4/28/11)
-spark plug wires (4/28/11)
-distributor cap and rotor (4/28/11)
-igniter (3/28/11)
-starter
-replaced all 3 belts (6/8/10) 
-air filter

Only trades I'd be interested in are Glock 17, 19 or 26 or AR15 parts upper or lowers, barrels, handguards, 2-stage triggers, stocks, etc. but there needs to be some cash included.

Please feel free to call, text or email with questions or to view and drive the truck.

The truck was my daily driver for a couple of years until I bought something bigger so it's time for it to go to a good home. The truck is pretty clean with a few small used vehicle dings and very minor rust around the wheel wells. The interior is in great condition and was never smoked in. The exterior is very clean for a vehicle of this age, especially a Toyota pickup. The truck has manual windows and locks. The heat works and the air conditioning actually works too and blows ice cold. Has the original am/fm radio with cassette player. The truck has locking hubs and the 4wd engages flawlessly. The bed has a Bodygard bedliner. The truck has about 40% rubber left on Goodride Radial M/S 31x10.5x15's with black American Racing steel wheels. The tires need balanced. The oil was changed at regular 3,000 mile intervals. The truck will come with a service manual, owner's manual and an oil filter. Here's the deal with the truck it starts and runs but I think there is a problem with either the fuel pump or idle air control valve. Sometimes it will drive fine for 30+ miles and other times it will stall when coming to a stop. Also sometimes it surges when under throttle and feels like you are giving it gas but it won't go. It can be driven home or to a shop to be worked on . It also has a power steering fluid leak. I had this for sale a few months ago when it was running fine and was getting offers of $2500-$2600 but I'm sick and tired of messing with it and I want it gone. The best offer at or over $1800 can have it. I'll entertain offers for about a week and if someone comes up with the cash it's theirs.

I AM interested in other surplus military rifles, other WWII era rifles, etc. 

The pictures tell the story. The stock was duffle bag cut, the barrel was cut but not recrowned yet, and the bolt handle was broken when the previous owner tried to bend it for scope clearance. You can still buy bent bolt handles and sporter stocks to finish the job. 

Another option is to use it for parts, as most of the metal is in great shape. Screw heads are nice, the butt plate is not rusty, good receiver with nice serial number, etc. 

The rifle comes with some used brass as well as 3 reloads that were given to me.

This double-action pistol may be tiny, but it’s a reliable defensive arm. The tip-up barrel of this pocket pistol allows rounds to be loaded directly into the chamber without slide retraction. Precisely rifled for accuracy, the barrel is forged out of special high strength stainless steel.

QUALITY POCKET PISTOLS. 
The same dedication to advanced design, uncompromising quality and strict quality control that make the 92F, Cougar and Cheetah such international standouts is found in all Beretta small caliber, pocket-size pistols. Simplicity, safety and practical use are their best qualities.

PRACTICAL AND SIMPLE. 
User-friendly design is common to all Beretta small frames. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore quickly checked. Jamming and stovepiping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas. 

ADVANCE MATERIALS. 
Keeping an eye on quality helps keep Beretta small caliber semi-automatics out front. Beretta pistols in the 21 Series utilize the toughest of forgings for their barrels, while slides are fashioned from solid steel bar stock. Frames are machined from solid aluminum forgings. The new Inox versions utilize the finest materials, difficult to machine but exceptionally corrosion resistant and durable. 

21 BOBCAT. TRUSTWORTHY AND PRECISE.
Chambered for .22LR or .25ACP (6.35 mm). This compact, rugged small frame measures just 4.9 inches (125 mm) overall and weighs only 11.5 ounces (325 grams). It features a lightweight, alloy frame, blued steel slide, tip-up barrel, and double/single action. The Bobcat comes with a 7-round magazine for .22LR ammunition, or an 8 round magazine for .25 (6.35 mm)caliber cartridges.

To be very clear, don't waste my time or yours with low ball offers, the rifle WILL sell, and im more than capable to sit on it for a few months until i get what i want. Send me an email for more pictures or questions.
