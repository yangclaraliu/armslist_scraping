""Covert frames are coated in Desert Tan KimPro II™ a premium finish that is durable, self-lubricating and extremely resistant to the elements. Black matte slide and small parts give each pistol a dynamic appearance. 

Tactical Wedge night sights, 30 lines-per-inch front strap checkering and beavertail grip safety are standard on all Covert models. The Custom Covert II and Pro Covert II have lanyard rings plus a magazine with an extended bumper. 

Covert pistols are made in the Kimber Custom Shop, where they are fit and finished by hand. Crimson Trace Lasergrips in digital camouflage pattern with Kimber logo offer critical tactical and training advantages. 


Covert pistols have Tactical Wedge night sights and Crimson Trace Lasergrips. If you can see, you can aim. Light weight aluminum frames make them easy to carry, and Kimber quality ensures absolute dependability-even when the lights go out. 

This is a used gun; It's not in perfect 'like new' condition, but it's close.  The night sights glow and the laser is strong, bright and tight.  The trigger pull is clean and crisp.  It is the best shooter in my collection.

The gun has probably a little less than 400 rounds through it. I hand fitted and installed the rear sight on my own and didn't have a sight pusher so the rear sight has some shallow dents in the side where I used a punch wrapped in duck tape to tap it in place (shown in pics). If you have a sight pusher and a dremel it could be dressed up and reinstalled in probably 15 minutes. I did carry this gun for a little bit, so there is some light holster wear on the dust cover (shown in pics) and two little nicks in the finish behind the ejection port (shown in pics)."

CZ-52 pistol (known in Czechoslovak service as 7,62mm Pistol vzor 52, or Vz.52 in short) was born from Czechoslovak army trials for a new military pistol, conducted between 1947 and 1951. Early trials requested pistol to be made in 9x19mm Luger / Parabellum. The basic design of the CZ-52 is attributed to Jan Kratochvil, who worked at CZ-Strakonice arms factory. This was a double-action, locked-breech pistol with an unusual roller-locking system, borrowed from the German MG-42 machine gun. Under pressure from the USSR Czechoslovakia standardized the 7.65x25 round of Soviet origin as its pistol and sub-machine gun ammunition, and the new pistol was redesigned for the “new” cartridge by Jiri Cermák, who worked at CZ-Uhersky Brod (CZ-UB) arms factory. During the redesign this pistol also lost its double-action capability (but retained decocking feature of its safety).
Introduced into Czechoslovak army service in 1952, this pistol was declared obsolete in 1982 with adoption of the 9mm vz.82 pistol, and most retired pistols were sold as surplus after 1987. The Vz.52 was not a popular weapon among its users, but mostly because of over-powered standard issue ammunition intended for sub-machine guns and loaded to higher pressures. With the standard, “pistol grade” 7.62x25 or 9mm ammunition it more manageable and may show good accuracy and an adequate life cycle.

The Vz.52 pistol is a short-recoil operated, locked-breech pistol of somewhat unusual construction. The barrel recoils linearly, without any tilting, which increases the accuracy potential (at least, in theory). Two rollers, located below the breech part of the barrel, are used to interlock the slide and barrel in the early stages of recoil. The rollers allowed to move laterally toward the axis of the gun, and this movement is controlled by cam-shaped cuts in the frame. When the barrel and slide are in battery, the rollers are extended from the barrel sideways and engaged in the respective cuts in the slide. Upon recoil, the rollers are withdrawn from the slide cuts following the cam-shaped tracks in the frame, thus unlocking the side from the barrel and allowing it to resume the reloading cycle. Another unusual feature is that return spring is located around the barrel, and its rear end is resting against special part, which is integral to the barrel unit but does not move upon recoil, being locked to the frame. The trigger is of the single action type, with an external hammer and a frame mounted, decocking safety. Yet another unusual feature (at least for a full-size service gun) is that while it has a slide stop, which holds the slide open when the last cartridge has been fired, the slide stop does not have a manual release lever. The only sure way to release the slide from being held open is to remove the empty magazine, pull the slide all the way back, then release it and let it slam home. One could try to push the slide stop lever (located above the trigger guard at the left side of the frame) with a finger, but this may or may not work, especially with wet or oiled hands. The grip panels are made from bakelite or plastic and held in place by a U-shaped spring clip. The sights are fixed, with the rear being dovetailed to the slide. Magazines are of single stack type, and the magazine release is located at the heel of the grip.
Manual safety: Lever at left side of the frame, behind grip panel. To set on safe: push the lever up; to disengage safety: pull the lever down; a red dot will appear on the frame. The safety blocks the action regardless of the hammer position, cocked or not. To decock the hammer: push the safety lever up from ""safe"" position, and hammer will fall. NOTE: do it with an empty chamber to avoid accidental discharges if parts in the safety mechanism are worn.

How to field-strip (disassemble) Cz-52 pistol 1) remove the magazine by pressing the magazine release button; 2) check that the chamber is empty; 3) push the safety lever up to decock the hammer; 4) pull down the serrated take-down knobs (located at the top of the frame, above the front parts of trigger-guard); 5) holding the knobs down, push the slide slightly forward and remove up and out of the frame; 6) while holding the slide upside down, use the front tip of magazine bottom plate (or a flat screwdriver) to move the roller cam (located below the barrel breech) forward, so the rollers will be retracted from the slide; 7) tilt the rear part of the barrel slightly up and pull it out of the slide; 8) remove the return spring from the barrel.
Reassemble in reverse order.

This is the version with the side rail (for red dot or other optic); the current batch of Saiga 12 shotgun imports do not have the side rail, but I am fuzzy on whether this is a permanent or temporary change to the import rules, production, or something else.

This rifle is in rough shape, A fixer upper.

The receiver is a winchester and the manufacturer can be seen, even though it is nearly illegible. The internal parts are mix and match from various armory reworks, I would guess. This rifle is barrel stamped as an import.
The barrel might need to be replaced I believe as the bore does not appear to be very good. I note a couple splits on the handguards. The main stock appears to be sound though aged.

I would suggest this rifle for someone that wanted a rugged looking wall hanging or perhaps for someone learning drill team with an M1 and not wanting to damage a valuable rifle in practice with drops.

        I am truly pained to do this, but because of some unfortunate events in life, I am forced to sell one of my loved ones. I bought this Rifle with the intention of keeping it for the better part of my life. Picked her up about three months ago... And again I honestly never thought i would have to sell this gun but here I am doing the unthinkable. I bought the gun from Past Tenths Sports Inc. (Jerry Schwier) for $910.00. The Rifle was equipped with the Tasco scope when I picked her up. The trigger action is crisp as is the lever action. Well maintained Rifle. One of my favorite features of the gun is the octagonal barrel. All wood is in great condition with few minor scratches or divots. I would say the gun is in 90% condition. The shoulder strap mounts were obviously used. Other then that the gun is awesome shape. Hands down one of my favorite. Hate to get ride of such a beautiful and awesome functioning Rifle, but life has got the best of me and my toys once again. Also comes with 75 rounds of Tactical Ammunitions 7mm Mag. May or may not come with soft case. 

My price is $950.00 Firm. Not a penny less. FTF Only. Can meet at FFL dealer. Serious inquiries only please. You can call/text me at REDACTED - Dalton. 

I am only open to trades if the value of the trade exceeds $550.00 with $500.00 cash on top (your end)."

Note the screw caps and rubber eyepiece are NOT included.  I'm looking for $650 shipped or $640 FTF in the Lexington area.  I will consider trades for a VX-III or VX-3 2.5-8x33 or 3.5-10x40mm scope in matte or silver finish plus cash on your end to make it fair.

This gun has an SB2 frame with NT prefix, serial number 327xxx.  The .223 barrel is original to the gun and the .270 barrel was purchased used last year on Graybeard but it fit perfectly without any modifications.  Both are very accurate and are equipped with Nikon Omega 3-9x40mm scopes with the regular Nikkoplex reticles on NC Star quick release rings.  The entire set shows minor use but rates 95% overall.  

I can meet for a FTF in Lexington, buyer must show valid driver's license or CCDW to prove residency.  Looking for $725 for everything shown or $425 without the scopes and rings which I can use for something else.  I will also ship to your FFL but figure another $25 for the cost of transit.  Either way I'll throw in a well-used but functional double rifle black plastic hard case which is not shown.  

I'm not really interested in parting it out yet but will consider it if I have a buyer for every component.

This model is very similar to the traditional sidelock T/C New Englander but features all-weather stainless steel construction, Rynite synthetic stock, 24” barrel with 1:48 RH twist, 7 lb approx weight and 41” OAL.  

This rifle comes equipped with an illuminated T/C 3-9x32mm scope on genuine T/C rings and base.  Overall the gun is in excellent condition but shows minor signs of use. Note that I do not have the rear sight and have never shot this rifle.  I had one just like it without a scope, sold it last year then found this one soon after.   My previous Grey Hawk was an exceptional shooter with open sights within 100 yards so I’m sure this one will be no different.  I’d keep it but have a Traditions muzzleloader that I like more so am letting it go.  

I'm looking for $300 FTF in the Lexington area and buyer must show a valid driver's license or CCDW to prove you are of age.  Since this is a muzzleloader, I can ship this directly to your doorstep anywhere in the Lower 48 for an extra $25 and only require an emailed or paper copy of your driver’s license for my records.

I added an ATI pistol grip and picatinny rail (that mounts via standard AK style mounting pad that is riveted to the left side of the receiver). This allows you to mount a red dot or scope, etc. The rifle has the cleaning rod, bayo lug, screw-on AK74 style compensator/flash hider. I am including THREE proper Bulgarian magazines. The stock is also black polymer and is a tad longer than the typical AK47 wooden stock according to my judgment. It fits better, IMHO, unless you are wearing plates.
IS THIS AN AK-47??? Note, this is exactly like an AK47 but takes the newer round used by Warsaw Pact; 5.45mm x 39. I have plenty of places I shop that sell it for about $130 per 1,080 rounds. It is more accurate over longer distances, lesser recoil (less than an AR15, too) and ammo is cheaper than 7.62x39. It is also becoming more available than 7.62x39 since it has been replacing it in military service since 1974 (thus the name AK-74). Most AK accessories fit exactly the same ,too.
I am in central Ohio. Price is cash only to an 18 year old Ohio resident. I prefer CCW Licensee. If you have more questions please feel free to ask. I have a few extra mags I can sell as well.
Plate carrier, plates, AR mags, IFAK, camelbak, pouches and EOTech are not included.

These leather butt stock covers will make you the envy of all your friends.
Made from real leather, then they are stained to look like they have traveled the wild west right along with John Wayne. 

MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS IS MADE TO SAVE THE WOOD ON YOUR STOCK

THREE STYLES TO CHOOSE FROM:
Morgan Dollar Deluxe **ON SALE! $39 
The Trapper **ON SALE $34 (has the holes along front of cover)
The Hunter **ONSALE $34 (no holes on front)
The hunter doesn't have the decorative holes around the front of the cover. It's more of the original 1800's style.
 Very simple for the original hunter style that many protected their 1894's. Like the Trapper, it does have the leather ribbon on the right side. This was the most common decoration on the old Winchesters. 
It was often seen to have feathers or beads added. Many now days leave it just like it is.
**Does not slip around on stock once laced on**
Not only does this cover add style to your lever action it serves a huge purpose to protect your stock from scratches and dents.
(No two covers are alike stained, all may vary from one to the other)

Came from a Winchester estate collection and is unfired. It shows a couple minor handling marks but is overal in excellent shape. It is a Mississippi River Gambler Spirit of St. Louis. It is a 30-30. From what I can find there were three versions of the Ms. Gambler made; St. Louis, Memphis and New Orleans. There were only 40 of each produced. This one is numbered #23. It would make an excellent addition to someone's collection. I did not get the box or paperwork with it. If you are interested I think the value is around $950 but I will sell for $900 and will take trades. I have no way of knowing a good value for it because I have been able to find out very little about it. I will consider offers but please no lowballs, I knowwhat I have in this rifle and was planning on just holding on to it to see what I could find or make on it in the future, but do not have the time and have a long list of other guns I would rather be shooting instead of looking at.

Excellent condition, look and function. This is pistol is virtually externally identical to the M9 in use by the military, except this is a stainless model and is chambered for .40 S&W instead of the NATO 9mm. It is fun and affordable to shoot at the range and packs more than enough punch to use in a defense situation. 
 I am only selling it to pay for a new toy that I have my eyes on. 

The gun comes with the original factory 10 round magazine, trigger lock, and the box with case.


I have additional accessories for an additional cost if you are interested.
For pictures or any other information please shoot me an email."

Below is an email I received from the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners Association.   Everyone should read before voting tomorrow.

---------------
With Iowa, South Carolina, Florida and Nevada Presidential nominating contests behind us, it's now our turn, right here in Colorado, to go to the Presidential Caucuses. 

Keep in mind, tomorrow night's caucuses are a straw poll -- the results are not binding -- but I want you to go into the caucuses fully informed.

So, I want to give you a quick update on our Presidential Survey program.

RMGO has teamed up with the National Association for Gun Rights in mailing every candidate for President an official Presidential Gun Rights Survey.

While Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann returned their surveys while they were still in the race, Ron Paul is the only remaining Republican candidate who has returned his survey 100% in favor of gun rights. 



What we do know is that each candidate has the Presidential Survey in hand -- and that's why I am worried. 

I have serious concerns about Romney, Santorum, and Gingrich. It's their records that are disconcerting. 

Let me take a minute or two right now to remind you about the positions of the three Presidential candidates who have so far refused to return their Rocky Mountain Gun Owners Presidential Survey.

Mitt Romney:

So far Mitt Romney has refused to respond to his gun rights survey, perhaps because when Mitt Romney was Governor of ultra-liberal Massachusetts he signed a bill to ban an entire class of firearms.

Would he do the same thing -- or even worse -- as President of the United States? His record indicates that he would. 

Mitt Romney supports the Brady Registration Act, mandatory 5-day waiting periods, mandatory firearms ID cards, the Federal Feinstein Gun Ban (so-called ""assault weapons ban"") and he signed the Massachusetts Semi-Auto Ban in 2004.

He even went as far as to say that he supported Massachusetts' tough anti-gun laws: ""We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them... I won't chip away at them; I believe they protect us and provide for our safety.""

And to throw fuel on top of Mitt Romney's anti-gun fire, he received the endorsement of John McCain this week, who himself has recorded promotional commercials for anti-gun groups hell-bent on restricting our Second Amendment rights.

Rick Santorum:

If you’ve watched any of the Presidential debates, you’ve noticed that Rick Santorum claims time and again to be a “fighter” who has “led on conservative issues.”

Rick Santorum’s record on the Second Amendment, however, tells a different story.

In the 90s, he voted to support the Lautenberg Gun Ban, which stripped law-abiding gun owners of their Second Amendment rights for life, simply because they spanked their children or did nothing more than grab a spouses wrist.

He voted for a bill in 1999 disguised as an attempt to increase penalties on drug traffickers with guns... but it also included a provision to require federal background checks at gun shows. 

In 2000, Santorum voted to force pawn shops to require a background check on anyone coming into the store to sell a firearm.

And then he voted with gun-controlling Democrats Dianne Fienstein and Frank Lautenberg to mandate locks on handguns in 2005. 

But worst of all, Rick Santorum has a storied history of bailing out anti-gun Republicans facing reelection. 

Rick Santorum came to anti-gun Arlen Specter’s defense in 2004 when he was down in the polls against pro-gun Republican Pat Toomey. Specter won and continued to push for gun control during his years in the Senate.

He also supported and openly campaigned for anti-gun New Jersey governor, Christine Todd Whitman.

It certainly appears that Rick Santorum has no regrets about his past anti-gun record. Worse, it appears he’d be happy to continue along this path as President.



Newt Gingrich:

For those who have followed Newt Gingrich’s career, the revelation that he talks out of both sides of his mouth won’t be a surprise.

Despite claiming to be pro-gun, Newt Gingrich’s reign as Speaker was downright hostile to our Second Amendment rights.

Newt supports the Brady National Gun Registry, a national biometric thumbprint database for gun purchasers, the Lautenberg Gun Ban and the “Criminal Safezones Act."" 

Newt doesn't think the Brady Instant Gun Registry goes far enough -- he wants thumbprints: 

""I think we prefer to go to instant check on an immediate basis and try to accelerate implementing instant checks so that you could literally check by thumbprint... Instant check is a much better system than the Brady process."" -- June 27, 1997 

Gingrich may claim to be pro-gun . . . 

But his record indicates otherwise, and his refusal to answer his gun rights survey should give any Second Amendment supporter cause for concern.



You and I know that we have the most anti-gun President in the history of our country right now in the Oval Office . . . 

. . . but perhaps even more dangerous would be a Republican with a proven anti-gun history cutting backroom, anti-gun deals.

This package is extremely hard to find as Ruger only offered this for one year in 1999. To find the package is one thing but to find it still intact is another. To top it off,this one is new and unfired. No box is present.
This was a rare offering by Ruger that came in a stainless carbine with laminated stock equipped with a factory scope,rings and sling. The scope and sling have the Ruger emblems on them from the factory.

It is in pristine condition.

This is a highly sought after rifle that keeps climbing in value.
It was the only offering Ruger provided with a 22"" barrel. This model is sought after not only for it's shootability but because of it's collectability as well.

This is the older first generation 22"" sporter that has recently has been reintroduced but with a cheaper painted barrel and plastic trigger guard. This rifle has the polished SS barrel and metal trigger guard. The less expensive birch sporter stock was replaced with the more deluxe version true walnut with factory checkering. The results were a great shooting rifle with amazing looks.

These models are fetching more than $300 for the ones which the lesser birch stock. This one is equipped with the much nicer quality walnut stock.

The P9 Covert model is no longer made by Kahr -- it preceded the PM9. It features a P9-length slide/barrel assembly with a PM9-length grip. It is believed that these were ""made"" by Kahr by cutting down and refinishing P9 frames at the factory rather than molding unique P9 Covert frames, and indeed you'll see aftermarket P9 Covert conversions occasionally. This is confirmed as a factory P9 Covert by the factory sticker on the Kahr case.

This pistol is in excellent condition and round count is estimated at less than 1000 total (less than 400 in my use). Includes one flush 6-rd magazine and one 7-rd extended magazine. It also has the factory-option tritium 3-dot night sights, though they are not especially bright now.

This P9 runs exceptionally well; the only malfunction in my own use (between 300 and 400 rounds) was with Blazer aluminum-cased ammo. No malfunctions with any JHP's I've tried, nor with WWB hardball ammo.

I'm also including a Comp-Tac Minotaur MTAC IWB holster, with brown regular belt loops, black hidden belt hooks, and extra hardware. This has some wear; essentially, the same wear you'd put on it the first 3 or 4 times you used it. This holster plus extra belt hooks would run you over $90 new.

The package includes:

Kahr P9 Covert w/ original Kahr molded box, Kahr papers, trigger guard lock
6-rd flush magazine
7-rd extended magazine
Comp-Tac Minotaur MTAC IWB holster with brown belt loops and black hidden belt hooks w/ extra hardware

$525 face to face in MS (willing to travel short distance from Jackson/Ridgeland area)

$525 plus actual shipping cost via UPS Standard Overnight Insured to your FFL (must accept shipment from individual)
