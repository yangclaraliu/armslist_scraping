It comes with a well fitted beavertail grip safety is standard as is a combat hammer, match trigger and a slightly extended mag release. The magwell is also beveled for easy seating of a magazine. The grips are hand checkered and are the slim variety which is fitting for a concealment 1911. This pistol is all steel with a forged slide. The barrel is 3 1/2 inches long and has a bull barrel which does not use a bushing. The recoil system has duel springs for reduced felt recoil. These are series 70 type guns without the idiotic lawyer inspired so called safety systems of some other 1911 makers. This makes for a much better trigger pull. In fact the trigger on this gun is very crisp with little takeup. The pistol comes with two magazines made by ACT of Italy. These are the same magazines used by Novak and Wolff Gunspring company. They are excellent magazines and feed very smoothly. Of course you can also use any full size magazine in this gun for your extra magazines. Gun has been carried has some finish marks around the muzzle. Shoots every round put to her p+ loads etc. Comes with two 6rd clips and holster.Thanks for looking all laws obeyed FTF"

This gun was made in 1954, and has been shot very little.  I aquired the gun 10 years ago.  At that time, there were a few hunting marks on the barrel and stock.  I took it to a professional gunsmith that completely dissassembled the gun, cleaned it, re-blued just the barrrel, and refinished the stock. It was put away and never fired since.

The Model 4 is a relatively simple handgun of blowback design, with a fixed barrel, an external extractor, and a concealed hammer. Its most unusual feature is that (like its predecessor the Model 3) its extractor and ejection port are on the left. The barrel acts as a guide for the concentric recoil spring, which is held in place by a bayonette-type lug that covers the front of the barrel, and by a sleeve at the rear which also serves to cover the spring. When the slide moves rearward, it forces the trigger bar down, disconnecting it from the sear. The safety is a rotating thumb lever that positively locks the cocked hammer. There is a screw on the backstrap of the grip that regulates the tension of the flat hammer spring. The gun is well-balanced, fits the hand very nicely, and points instinctively. It is also reasonably accurate.
There is absolutely no play in the fitment of the slide and receiver. The gun is spot-on at 25 to 50 yards. The trigger pull is rather heavy and the gun has considerable recoil. Recoil causes the trigger guard to batter my trigger finger, making it sore after a couple of magazines, so I prefer to shoot the gun with a glove on. Nevertheless, the grip fits my hand perfectly and it points better than any gun except the Remington Model 51. The slide does not stay back on the last round, and there is no provision for locking it open. The gun lacks a magazine safety and may be fired without a magazine. The thumb safety is very easy to disengage, but it is more secure than that of the 1910 Browning,bore and crown are exelent, rifleing is strong, great action.fun shooter .ya might wanna make this one a safe queen,the finish is still almost all there it fires fine and has a nice pop to it, i will trade for a semi auto of equal value or sell for $500 no lowball offers please . must be of age and present state i.d"

NEBO PROTEC ELITE HP190LS combines a brilliant white light with an adjustable bright red aiming laser. It uses a highly efficient CREE® Q5 LED to generate 190 lumens of intense white light with a 5-milliwatt, 650 nanometer laser sight, located below the light. Light of this magnitude is enough to dominate an aggressor’s night adapted vision, ideal for military, law enforcement, and self-defense. The reflector lens focuses the beam for long distance lighting while also producing enough light to support the user’s peripheral vision. The HP190LS’ batteries will produce 3 hours of continuous illumination. The compact body of the HP190LS is constructed of aircraft grade anodized aluminum making it a lightweight, yet powerful light source. The HP190LS is also O-ring and gasket sealed to be completely weatherproof. The HP190LS features an ambidextrous momentary/steady On-Off switch to provide one-finger operation. This switch allows you to select 100% white light or defensive strobe. A separate switch on the bottom is used to control the laser. Laser travels over 450 yards.


Features

Serial no. is B 27650 which places this in the late 1896 for date of manufacture.  Numbering on this later continued by the famous successor arm the Model 1897 utilizing smokeless powder ammunition.  Action works well and the stock and forearm are solid, there are some hairline cracks on the forearm though, but doesn't affect the functionality of this piece. Missing a butt plate.  Production on the 1893 was limited, thus adding to the attraction of the type to collectors. This is an antique.  Not interested in trades or shipping.  FTF transaction with appropriate Ohio ID."

DPMS Panther Arms, continuing their commitment to customer service, has responded to numerous customer requests for a heavy hitting version of the classic 5.56 rifle by introducing the new LR-TAC20, a 20” tack-driving rifle chambered in .308 Winchester. This new LR-TAC20 features many of the same qualities which have made all of the Panther LR-308 rifles successful, including the milled 6061-T6 aluminum lower receiver, outstanding accuracy, reliability and an affordable price tag.
What defines this bigger and badder version of a classic 20” rifle is the thick-walled, extruded A3-style upper receiver (featuring a detachable carrying handle designed specifically for .308 rifles), the slim-line 4-rail free float tube and the kick provided by the .308-chambered heavy barrel with a beefed-up Panther Flash Hider. These features differentiate the new LR-TAC20 from all other LR-308 rifles, as well as the classic 20” 5.56 model. Additional features include a standard A2 front sight assembly, an A2 Black Zytel Mil Spec buttstock with trap door assembly and hard coat anodizing. DPMS’ black Teflon® coating completes the package. Customers will applaud the new beefed-up .308 version of a classic rifle and appreciate the upgraded upper receiver, 4-railed free float tube, reliability, accuracy and affordability of DPMS LR-308 rifles."

Original retail price $2800 bought on sale for $2174 and $2326 after taxes. Size 7 14k White Gold with a raised Trillion Cut( http://www.diamondsonweb.com/information/trillion-cut-diamonds.mhtml ) Center stone .4 Carats. Can you say big?
All stones are eye clean and I was unable to see inclusions with a 10X jewelers loop. Not a professional so I won't try and tell you the actual clarity measurements. Center stoned is complimented by 7 .085 carat (approx) diamonds in channel setting positioned with the corners up and down so they all touch corners in a a line. There is even a diamond under the main stone that increases the incredible fire the main stone already has. Ring comes with a Lifetime Rhodium plating and diamond warranty from Kay Jewelers. This is very useful being that a rhodium dip is around $30 right now and the average ring needs dipped every 6 months of wear to keep the luster. That alone saves you $60 a year that is $600 in ten years!!! This ring was a limited production ""showcase ring"" very few of these were made by Kay Jewelers, very hard to find another like it. Would hold onto it but my wife wants to take up shooting as a hobby so we are looking to get some start up cash to do so. If you want to see the ring we can meet at Kays in the mall or another similar neutral place. More pics available.

Front fairings and clip-ons were taken off and installed a new $400 LSL superbike bar set with triple clamp and steel braided front brake line. Also installed custom brackets to mount a Givi windscreen and single round 9"" headlight. Fresh Amsoil oil change, K&N air filter. Tires are good, chain/sprockets are good.

Comes with a brand new set of front and rear brake pads, never installed, although the brake pads on it are fine.

If you know anything about these TL's, you know that these vtwins have monster torque and power and sound like a muscle car.

The slug barrell is pretty darn accurate in my opinion shooting 1.5-2 inch groupings at 100 yards with 2-3/4"" Winchester XP3 300 grain Sabot slugs
This guns shell capacity is 2 +1 with the current plug. 
The wood stock has a few handling marks , and slight hardly noticable impressions from normal hunting use and the receiver has 2 very small scratchs under a quater of an inch.
This gun shoots good, the only reason Im selling is to purchase a camo Turkey gun.
Im selling the combo without the leather sling shown in the picture for $325.00 or i'll let the combo. go without the scope for $300.00

If you don't reload I can leave it out and adjust the price. If you just want the reloading components, make an offer on them.)

This is Fulton’s conversion of a Polytech M14s. Essentially everything but the forged, not cast, receiver was replaced. It is a heck of a shooter but when I got this done in 1999 I realized my eyes weren’t up using a serious match rifle. I took it to two matches and never used it much as shown by that unopened bag of brass.
The bore is excellent. Some of the white/yellow stuff in the pictures is the tetra grease.

Here is what Futon did:
Polytech Upgrade: Replace Hammer & sear, complete bolt 7790186 TRW ZJ, Op Rod 7267064 HRA, rear sight complete, NM flash suppressor without bayo lug (The was a ban on.), NM front sight,  reparkerized, op rod spring, NM spring guide, gas lock, op rod guide & pin, as system, connector lock, barrel, buffer, hammer pin.

Upgrade to medium weight barrel – marked Fulton Armory, NM gas system, NM aperture (rear sight), NM trigger. It was put in a GI fiberglass stock. The hole on the rear right is the missing naughty bits.

There are lots & lots of extras:

11 Twenty round mags, 4 never used by me but all surplus. I believe I bought these before the 94 ban since I had a reweld then.
2 5 round mags, came with rifle.

It has a Bushnell Sportview scope and mount. This had been on it before the conversion.

IMI Match 308 brass. One bag is unopened, I believe with 500 pieces. The other bag is once fired with 223 pieces.

A set of 3 Dillon dies and a Redding die.

A couple of books on the M14.

I’m not really interested in trades. Maybe for a small part of it but mainly cash.
