This gun has been in the family for decades but I'm looking for something new. It was primarily used for trap shooting.  It hasn't seen much action in the past 15 years and has been just sitting in the safe.  The gun has normal wear marks.  The wood shows signs of wear but it has no deep scratches or dents.  Overall a nice gun.  Im in downtown Indy.

I was overwhelmed with about 15 offers to buy it, then had two people not return my calls and show up.  Several people wanted both the rifle and scope, so that is how I have decided to sell it.

Price is 100% firm.  Cash only.  No trades.  I can meet you in the Brier Creek area any time tonight or Saturday.  First one to show up takes it.

Email goes directly to my phone, so I will respond quickly with my phone number if you want it.


The rifle is an older Savage Model III 7mm Rem Mag.  It works fine and has been my deer rifle for the last 10 years or so.  The wood grain of the stock is nice, but the stock could benefit from being refinished.  The barrel has some small bits of rust and needs to be blued.  I hope someone can use this as a project gun.  

The scope is a Bushnell Banner 3-9x40AO.  I bought it in 2010 and it is still in good condition.  The glass is clear and has no scratches, etc.  The end caps are included.

You must be a NC resident with a valid drivers license.  I will provide a Bill of Sale.

1) Springfield Armory 1911 LOADED
Trijicon Night Sights 2009 (Still very bright)
Wilson Combat Ambi Safety (Parkerized)
Wilson Combat G.I. Recoil Guide and Plug (Stainless)
Wilson Combat Barrel Bushing (Blued)
Wilson Combat Back Strap (25 LPI, Parkerized)

Comes with original wood grips (shown below), a set of Black Rubberized Pachmyer Grips, box and papers, 2 x Kim Pro Tac Magazines (8 rd) and one stock 7 rd magazine.

I am the second owner. I do not have the original parts as they were not included. The previous owner and I have both sent a total of about 650 rounds down the pipe. It is still in great condition with only minor wear on the lower front of the slide. I will also include a Blued Wilson Combat spare slide release, a Wilson combat Stainless G.I. Thumb Safety and a Wilson Combat Stainless Bushing for free.
Asking $760

2. Smith & Wesson 686-3, 6"" Stainless (Produced from 1988-1993)
Will come with 2 HKS Speed Loaders with magnum rounds and a dual speed loader pouch. Includes generic but decent pistol case, Blackhawk Thumb Break hip holster and a thororugh cleaing.
Excellent condition, has only shot about 140 rounds which were mostly .38spcl. It still has the original wooden grips as well.
From what I have found, the dash 3 models are a bit more desirable, but of course not as much as the dash 0, 1, or 2. It does have a thin line on the cylnder but aside from that and normal wear, it is in great shape. Adjustable sights with front red ramp and rear white outline. The hammer has the actual pin on it, meaning no transfer bar. And the parts are not MIM, they are forged as the dash 3 models were, I believe, the last do to so.
Asking $700

I require a BOS and atleast 2 forms of I.D.

Very slight visible blueing loss around the sides the muzzle end and on some of the highest ridges of the receiver. Very minor.

Nothing to detract from the overall appearance and function. Appears never to have been refinished. All original. Well kept. Beautiful.           

I bought this rifle from an old timer and original owner back in the early 1980's and never fired it. It appears he seldom used the gun himself. 
Most of the very light blue loss appeared due to external gun oil application and in-and-out storage/handling in a padded cloth rifle case.

This is an incredibly unique rifle.  I had seen them in parades and at funerals firing salutes… but never for sale.  It is as the government turned it loose.  It has a tag on it that says it has a good headspace and the armorer signed it.  I have a certificate of authenticity on it. 


I need to qualify though, it is not as it was created… They have redone these for ceremonial rifles… shortening them and chroming them.  Now, if you did that it would ruin the value… if the government does that it becomes a rare specialty gun.  

Note that this gun has no front sights.  When they toss them around apparently the sights are in the way.  You don’t need to aim if you are shooting blanks.  

I can see rifling in there but it is probably considered to be rough. 

Deep down you know that this is a bargain.  A decent looking Krag goes for $1400 unless someone has altered it… this one is certified authentic. The certificate goes with it.

I also removed the Stock trigger. It comes ribbed, just about everyone hates this, and it acts like a saw on your finger. I replaced it with a smooth trigger. Remember, some of the prices are for new, but there is no charge for Certified Armorer installation, shipping costs or tax added as well. The only noticeable wear is on the safety, I can remove it if you like, it will leave a slot in the frame that will not affect the function of the weapon at all. There is a very small nick in the frame in front of the slide release/stop. I have original box, paper work, cable lock and everything else that comes with it new. I only have a camera on my phone, that is why they are so poor. The pictures make the weapon look so much worse than it actually is. I am a certified Glock Armorer, if you have any further questions, just ask. This package is ready to use with your ammo!

I have a nearly new Glock 30SF with about 100 rounds through it - That's IT!
With this pistol you are buying a pistol that looks and functions like new.  It is about as clean as they come.  There are 2x 10 round magazines and 2x 13 round magazines. You will also receive everything that came with this pistol except the nylon bore brush (approx $2) - it was filthy and I pitched it.  I have the original casings from the factory test fire, ALL of the Glock paperwork package, The magazine loader, In the small plastic bag in the picture I have a 12lb spring and a 3.5lb trigger bay you may choose to install if you wish.  You will also receive a Kholster brand leather/kydex conceal carry holster that is used but was cleaned weekly with saddle soap and it has LOTS of life left in it!  Check them out at kholster.com.  Also, of course, the original case.

I didn't put nearly enough pictures up before and the ones I put up - frankly, sucked.  I think now you will be able to see the deal you are getting!

I prefer face to face sale with South Carolina Residents in a public place during normal business hours.  You must show me some proof of SC residency.  I WILL be glad to meet any Georgia resident at an FFL in Augusta that is convenient for me.  You will have to pay their transfer fee - (usually about $20-$25)  WHY am I acting picky?  Because I don't want to break the law, it's just that simple.  I can sell to any SC resident as long as I am in SC.  If I sell to a GA resident, law requires me (or anyone else selling across state lines) to take it to a licensed firearms dealer for legal transfer.  If it were up to me - I'd sell it to someone in GA without the FFL BUT I don't make the rules!

No trades, No shipping, No hassles.

The rifle has a deep blue/black metal finish and an attractive birch stock with a smooth carbine style butt plate. The trigger pull  released with four and three-quarters pounds of pressure. The magazine holds nine rounds of .17 magnum ammo, and is of the excellent rotary design. Ruger’s rimfire rifles have the best magazine design in the industry. Most competitive .17 magnum rifles have a box magazine that looks like an afterthought, but the Ruger design fits flush with the bottom of the stock, and has about an eighty percent capacity advantage over most box magazines. The barrel wears a set of adjustable open sights, and is also supplied with a scope mount base that attaches to the pre-drilled receiver.Any question just ask...

I went out and got a rifle that I didn't really need, and I figure someone else could use it. I got a thompson center arms .50 muzzleloader, black diamond, comes with bullets, primers, ammo. Its a composite stock, fiberoptic adjustable sights, excellent condition. This is one of the more advanced, modern muzzleloaders on the market!!! Been shot twice.  You pull the bolt open, but in a primer, shove some powder and lead down the barrel, and your ready. And I'll even throw in a bore snake and a cloth sleeve for it. 

Great gun for any muzzleloader shooter, or someone who like a good quality gun! Plus, you muzzleloaders get an extra week of hunting.....

I just want it gone now. Its taking up room in my safe."

Winchester Model 70 / 300 Win. Mag.
This is a Model 70 Grey Shadow manufactured for RMEF as the 2002 RMEF sponsor gun. The gun is push feed. The left side of the barrel is stamped with standard ""Winchester Model 70 300 Win. Mag.” The right side is stamped with ""RMEF 2002"". These guns were never listed in the Winchester catalog that I know of. It could only be obtained at an RMEF banquet. Stock is a light grey composite, with black 'rubber' Winchester recoil pad. Magazine has hinged floor plate, rather than a blind magazine. This gun is no longer manufactured. 

Used but not abused, looks like it’s had a box of shells through it, 26 inch barrel, action and bolt are in great shape. Stock is in very good shape, it does show some use as a hunting gun as it should. Nice set of Redfield rings and bases. Redfield 3x9 five star scope with duplex retical has seen some real hunting use, more than likely on a different rifle, it has some scars but glass is in great shape. I tested the scope on a 7mm-08 and it held an inch at 100yd.

I am offering a BNIB CZ RV-85 launcher for your consideration.  It is still in it's original box with all the paper work, test target, extra springs and firing pin and still wrapped in the original plastic and wax paper.

This was originally made as a flare launcher but history shows it was ony used for other purposes.  Flare are still readily available online.

Only 3000 were made and only 1000 were imported to the USA.  These are rare and will certainly appreciate in value.  The vast majority are still sealed in their original packaging and most are in lots held by a small number of people.  

Please be very careful of how you use this if you decide to open and assemble this time capsule.  If anything other than the intended flares are used, it's immediately a Class III Destructive Device and requires the NSA Tax Stamp and proper registration.  This is a serious piece of military/police equipment and should be treated with the upmost respect.

It’s built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. A 25- and 10-round version of the magazine is available. Both are proportionate in size to the centerfire version’s mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine. The estimated retail price for the MP5 A5 is $475.
Operation

The .22 caliber HK MP5 A5 operates on a blowback system. The bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its front sight is adjustable for elevation and comes with interchangeable posts. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety switch rotates in the same manner as the 9 mm MP5."

In 2001, DPMS expanded from its share of the .223/5.56mm market, and exploded onto the .308 rifle scene. The LR-308, the first and foremost of the .308 line, and for which the rifle series is named, is a rifle to be reckoned with. So much so that it was named the NRA Rifle of the year in 2005.  With a 24” stainless bull barrel, 1 in 10 twist, free floating handguard and a high ride receiver for easier mounting of optics, the LR-308 has gone toe to toe with bolt action rifles and delivered comparable accuracy, with higher magazine capacity and rate of fire. The conventional thought that ""only a bolt action could be considered a precision rifle"" has been in contention ever since.  With numerous upgrades available, the LR-308 is the ultimate long range target and competition rifle.
