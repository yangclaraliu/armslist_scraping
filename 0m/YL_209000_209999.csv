The standard magazine holds 10 rounds, and a second with a grip adapter that holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers. The SR9c compact pistol also features high-visibility 3-Dot sight, serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or blackened finish. Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

With ability to rapidly change calibers, barrel lengths and stock
configurations, the Bushmaster ACR adapts to varied conditions like no
rifle that has come before it. In minutes, without tools, it will go from
5.56mm to 6.8mm to 6.5mm by swapping the bolt head, barrel and magazine.
With an exchange of stocks, barrels and accessories, it transforms from a
close quarters weapon to a designated marksman platform. Simply put, the
Bushmaster ACR is the highest evolution of modular rifle utility. This
rifle is built specifically for law enforcement and tactical applications -
with Bushmaster's unrivaled standards for durability and precision. They've
nearly doubled barrel life and reduced maintenance with the addition of an
innovative protective coating. This is also featured on action components
for dramatically reduced wear and enhanced operation. For the ultimate
blend of strength and reduced weight, they used rugged, high density
composite for the hand guard, lower receiver and stock. The heart of the
ACR is their gas piston operating system. It's torture tested and proven
reliable in the most brutal conditions on the planet. From the magazine
release and fire selector to the non reciprocating charging handle,
ambidextrous controls optimize user effectiveness. Add Bushmaster's
hallmark commitment to quality down to the slightest ingredient, and you
have a platform that's a natural fit for any operator and every mission.

Ruger SR9c 9mm Subcompact Pistol 

The SR9c compact pistol has the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines, for both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds, and a second with a grip adapter that holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers. The SR9c compact pistol also features high-visibility 3-Dot sight, serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or blackened finish. Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

Previous/original owner stated the rifle had less than 30 rounds through it. I have personally not had a chance to shoot it yet. As much as I would love to keep this thing my better judgement tells me I won't get to use it like I would want to.

Rifle will also come with 90 rounds of Alexander Arms Hollowpoints and a bipod adapter.

This forearm allows you to free-float the barrel of your AR without having to remove the original barrel nut or delta ring. If you have a mid length rifle this is just a drop in part, installation is very simple, no gunsmith needed.

The all-stainless construction of the P220 Elite Stainless provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long. As the next generation P220, the Elite builds on the exceptional reputation of out-of-the-box accuracy with the addition of SIG’s new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The SRT provides you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable short reset for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. No production pistol is more closely identified with superior performance than the P220 and the new P220 Elite offers shooters new features that enhance the pistol’s performance. These features include an ergonomic beavertail grip which allows you to obtain a confident grip from the holster even under stressful conditions. The beavertail also permits shooters to grip the pistol as high as possible without worrying about slide bite. Front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITE Night Sights and custom wood grips complete the P220 Elite.

I was trying to sell a shotgun on armslist. Did not set a price...no offers. So, I offered the shotgun as a trade. 

Ended up with this rifle. I own 2 DPMS Ar's - which is why I took this as a trade. I have had zero problems with my other ones.

So, this rifle has had 60 Rounds through it. The one and only previous owner purchased a AR .22lr rifle to replace this one. He liked 
the idea of spending less money on .22lrs. This rifle is less than a month old.

There is a scratch 1/8 - 1/4"" long on the underside of the Flash Hider and I forgot to ask for the cleaning kit and sling.

Stainless/Synthetic.  Serial # 790-1xxxx puts manufacture date somewhere 2004-2005.

I got this early this summer at a retailer ans was told by them that the person who brought it in only fired it to sight in the scope and then never shot it again.  So, actual round count is unknown. I have fired 50 rounds since I got it.  

Also there is some ammo as part of this package.  Ammo is as follows:

17 Rounds 150gr Winchester Ballistic Silvertips

1 box Winchester 130gr Power Points

1 box 130gr Federal Fusion

1 box Fiocchi 130gr Soft point

1 box Remington 150 CoreLokt

7 rounds 130gr Hornady InterBond

6 Loose rounds that I think are Federal Softpoints

1 box Federal 150gr Soft points

A sling is included.  There is a scope that could be included depending on trade/price (atleast $150 more).  AimSports Illuminated Cross hairs, ill give more details on that if interested. 

Also About 140 once fired brass.  I traded a different .270 for this one and I have kept all of the brass.  

Im just looking right now to see what people are willing to offer for this rifle. 

The trades I would be interested in: 10mm, .243, .204, .308, 9mm, .223, .41 Mag, 44 Mag maybe others.

Not interested in shotguns, hi points, handi rifles, low ball offers.

What you get is:

Caliber X-Change kit Model CALX-226-9-BSS - Slide and barrel with siglite night sights and 2 9mm mags. ($409 retail with the extra mag)

If you aren't familiar with these kits they are very nice, you just lock the slide, take down the lever, remove the slide you want off and slide on the slide you want on and load the appropriate mag.  

This is like having 2 different caliber guns in one and you can also buy the .40 caliber and 357 sig if you want.  


The P226 comes with it's own sig case and the X-change kit comes in it's own hard palstic case so it is easy to take to the range.

He is small for his age, and I am looking for something short and light weight.  I think the 243 caliber will suit him best, but I am open to listen to other suggestions. 

So far, I think I like the Remington 700 SPS the best, but also like the Marlin x7y.  I would also consider the Remington 700 ADL (Walmart version) but I don't want to pay the $391 they cost brand new.  Let me know what you have.  I have had multiple offers for single shots, and I am really trying to get a bolt action, multi-shot.

I have cash, but would prefer to do some trading if I have anything you would like:

History of Taurus 92:  
In 1980 we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo “lock, stock and barrel”
and immediately sought to improve on the classic Beretta design, resulting in the acclaimed Taurus 92 and 99 9mm pistols.Today, we’re taking these pistols further than they’ve ever been. Most notable is
Taurus’ drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won’t crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety that is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic “cocked and locked” mode as well as a functioning DA decocking lever. Available in fi xed sight Model 92 and in adjustable sight Model 99, you’ll be able to face any situation without compromise."

For any collectors out there you know just how rare this rifle is. Barely 100k rifles made across 6 years of WW2. This variant is a 1943 model. This is basically the Hungarian M35 that was modified to the specifications of Germany. It fires the 8x57 Mauser cartridge, accepts K98 bayonets, and some other minor details. Has the right petina, has the factory rear sight leaf adjuster (very hard to find, most broke and were swapped with K98 sight adjusters). Bore is okay, a little fuzzy but it shoots straight as an arrow. Very few of these left, this one has a lot of character including a name carved in the stock, it's in service grade condition, just like I like them.

I do not have to sell this so low offers will get nowhere, nor will lousy trade offers. 

Will trade for: Pistols (looking to trade to two pistols), I would prefer a CZ75 SP-01 phantom for myself, and a S&W SD9 for my wife. Open to firearms trades of other kinds. Cash is always king. Would trade for a good TIG welder as well."

The 3XMag magnifying module is specially designed for compatibility with Aimpoint® sights and for maximum flexibility and increased performance in the field.

Some good modifications were done and some good body work - it will however require re-wiring (pretty simple on these) and some TLC. I got it running with a battery and putting gas in the carb before I brought it home and have done absolutely nothing with it since that day. This would make a great start to a rock crawler or just a cool toy to run around town in.



Engine: L134 (period correct at least, but I believe it is original) you can listen to it run or I can send you a video clip of it running.



Transmission: Works in 1st and Reverse - haven't tried 2nd or 3rd.



Transfer case: Works - 4WD works as well. Needs rear output yoke replaced, currently front wheel drive only



Body: Good condition (actually great for the year) little to no rust that I've seen. Hat channels were replaced with angle iron (well done) and the body was skimmed with bondo - which is cracking in several places.



Other: Spring over axle conversion was done for lift. May need to re-evaluate the angels that were used.



Being sold as a project only as is - where is. $1200 OBO may be open to partial trades for hunting items

Excellent condition. Someone put on a rubber buttpad on it at some time in it's past but original buttplate contour appears to be intact- could be put back to stock configuration with an $8 plate from Numrich. Has an arsenal stock repair behind the bolt.

FR-8 rifles were developed during late 1950s in Spain during their transition from military bolt action rifles to new, select-fire CETME Mod.58 assault rifles, chambered for then-new 7.62x51 NATO ammunition. The FR letters stand for ""Fusil Refromando"", and both FR-7 and FR-8 rifles are conversions of the earlier Mauser type bolt action rifles, which were in abundance at the time because of adoption of new, more effective guns.
The FR-8 rifles were converted from Spanish Model 1943 rifles, which are based on Model 1898 Mauser action, also known as ""Large ring"" Mauser action. Conversions included new barrels, inserted spacers in magazines (to accommodate shorter rounds), shortened forends and new iron sights. 
The FR-8 rifle is a manually operated bolt action rifle. It employs Mauser type rotary bolt with two frontal locking lugs and single rear lug (FR-7 bolt has no rear safety lug), and Mauser-type extractor which provides controlled feed. Cartridges are fed from integral box magazine with 5-round capacity, which can be loaded using stripper clips or loose rounds. Barrel is equipped with muzzle brake / flash hider, which also can be used to launch NATO-standard rifle grenades. The short tube, located below the barrel, has mostly cosmetic purpose, as it serves to provide bayonet mount interface. Its inner space also can be used to store front sight adjustment tool or small cleaning kit. The iron sights consist of adjustable, hooded front sight and combination aperture/V-notch rear sight, which is made in the form of rotating disc. The rear sight disc has V-notch for 100 meters range and three apertures for 200, 300 and 400 meters range.
Bayonets and slings from CETME's will work with this rifle.

Bore is excellent and finish is in great shape. I've seen several in the past with no finish left on the bolt handle, but it looks like this one hasn't been used very much. These rifles are somewhat rare and have just about doubled in value in the past couple years, and will probably continue to go up.
Comes with a box of soft points.

I'd be willing to take partial or whole trades if you have something interesting. Not looking for hunting rifles. Would like to find a stainless revolver in .357, or milsurp rifles I don't already have. 
Buyer must be willing to sign a receipt. Will not ship.

Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P220 Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE night sights.

Rifle: Savage 111 FCXP3. Chambered in a 30-06 springfield. Tasco or Barska cheapie scope 3-9x40mm scope (came with rifle when bought new). Bore sighted, 1 magazine included. I would say this is LNWB (Like new without box)

Details: I am the only/original owner of this rifle. I bought it for the upcoming hunting season but I am just going to use my fathers rifle. This rifle has not even seen a full box of shells (only 15 rounds of Remington to be exact.) I will include 25 rounds of Remington 165gr Core-Lokt ammo and about 70 pieces of unprepared brass (mostly Winchester). Looking to keep this as one package right now. This is a perfect package for the upcoming season. 

Trades: Not really looking at trades this time as I could use the cash. I never hurts to ask though. Handguns would be my preference"
