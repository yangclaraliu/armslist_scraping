I could not determine the origin from the proof marks, but I believe this gun was made in England or Belgium. There are no markings other than EM-GE Mod. 5 on the right hand side of the frame and the caliber designation on the left. There is no serial number. It closely resembles a Colt .25 automatic in size and shape and appears to be a well made, high quality piece (the photos are much larger than the actual pistol). It is in caliber .320, a British cartridge, which is the equivalent of an American .32 short Colt cartridge. I cannot guarantee that the Colt cartridge will fit as in some .320s it does and in others it does not. The overall condition is very good, with just a very few pit marks and most of the bluing intact.

Heres a little info on the rifle:
 K 



The Daniel Defense v7 6.8 is one of our latest additions to our M4 rifle family. The v7 6.8SPC gives shooters the stopping power of a 6.8 cartridge with the accuracy of the Daniel Defense Cold Hammer Forged barrel. With the incorporation of our new Modular Float Rail (MFR) 12.0, this rifle provides each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability. Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube. In addition, the 3” Modular Picatinny Rail sections allow the shooter to customize the rail set up.




The v7 6.8 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine, v7 6.8 comes in two different configurations: no sights, fixed front/rear sights.

This is a tare down single shot gun. The condition is lacking a bit. Finish on barrel and cylinder worn of in several spots and the hammer has what I think is rust on it. The brass is in great shape. Handle has minor scratches. Anyone with gun sense could clean her up and make her new again. Everything mechanism wise works great. There is no case for this or paper work.

In 1979 the New York State Police ordered 3000 custom ""N"" Model 520's with fixed sights but they cancelled the order before delivery was made. 

S&W was well into production so they completed the run and in 1980 they were made available to the general public. To this day the Model 520 is the only N Frame, S&W 357 Magnum Revolver ever built with fixed sights 

This one is in new condition and I believe that it has never been fired. The original box has seen better days but it is correctly numbered to the gun.

This one has turret adjustments, end covers, and is in excellent condition. It has only endured about 50 rounds, and was never used for hunting or anything more demanding than some range work. 

The only reason I'm selling it is because I don't need the turret adjustments, and I want a 3-9 zoom. 

Note that this never came with any documentation. I called SWFA and they said it doesn't come with any. But I found some instructions online, and it's pretty self explanatory.

Full, intact Mum.  Metal work is in good condition (much better than average, thought the bolt sticks a little on extraction, may just need a deep cleaning, I've not investigated).  Stock needs either serious work or replacement.   There's a crack under the action (not serious), and the front is warped about 10-20 degrees out of alignment.    I picked this up out of a collection of vintage WWI and WWII rifles.  I've done a quick clean, had it at the range this week and put a dozen rounds through it.  Shoots fine.  The 6.5 Jap is a fun caliber - light recoil but a serious stopper.   Ammo is broadly available (even Cabela's sells it) as are reloading supplies.   Produced by the Kokura Arsenal early in WWII.  Hang Tag - USMC Sgt A. Arguello (I presume this is who brought it home).    I'll email photos on request."

---Original ad follows, now obsolete---
Clearing out guns to fund a new project, so this one must go.
It's a Norinco SKS, with ATI Black synthetic folding stock, 30 round removable steel mag, original bayonet (looks like new) and receiver cover scope mount with picatinny rail.
All the metal parts of the gun are in excellent shape. I was told the gun hasn't been fired much in the past 15 years or so, and I tend to believe it.
The bore is like a mirror, and the action shows no signs of excessive wear.
The action is a little loose in the stock, but that seems to be a common thing with aftermarket stocks.
I was planning to bed the action to firm it up, but need the money more than another project gun. :)

The price is firm, but I might consider a partial trade if you have something interesting.
I will ship, but you'll have to pay the shipping of course, and you'll have to pay up front.
I DO NOT use PayPal.
I am able to accept credit cards directly, but it will cost you an extra 3.5%, which is what they charge me.
I'm willing to drive a little to meet up, but please don't ask me to deliver it to someplace more than 20 miles from my location, which is near Farmville, NC."

Up for grabs is a Smith and Wesson Bodyguard .380. It has an integral Insight laser and comes with 2 mags, the pictured Galco holster, 125 rounds of PMC brass cased FMJ ammo, and the original box and paperwork. I bought it brand new and put approximately 175 rounds through it. It functions flawlessly and has very dependable and accurate for being so tiny. It does have actual sights so it's much easier to aim than the Kel-Tecs and Rugers of similar size. This particular BG380 is a 2nd generation model, so it has the improved take down lever and laser activation buttons.

I'm not very fond of selling guns, so this one is up for trade. I would be interested in a fullsize M&P 9mm to compliment my compact model. I could also use a similarly valued AK47 or other semi-auto rifle. I like most pistols and shotguns as well so feel free to make an offer, the worst I can say is no.

Listed here is a somewhat rare and amazing firearm.  This is the H&K P7 PSP (Police Model) in 9mm (9x19mm).

There is a great history behind these pistols.  After the Munich Olympics, Germany went through a total revision of its firearms, 1 of which was the procurement of a new standardized pistol for the military and police.  This pistol was developed as a result of those trials.

If you have watched Die Hard you remember ""Hanz"" wielding one of these ! :)

This particular pistol has been in my collection for some time.  It comes with the original matching serial numbered box, gas chamber brush and disassemble tool as well as the original manual.

NOTE that when you look for these, you will find many of them were refinished at the H&K Arsenal and now have what is called the ""plum"" colored slide.  This handgun DOES NOT have that appearance and is in the original 90-95% condition finish.

This also comes with a VERY nice leather OWB paddle holster made by Wild Bill Holsters.

I am not interested in trading unless you have an AR-15 in 7.62x39 caliber or I will put cash towards a Robinson Arms XCR-L in either .223 or 7.62x39

Contact info is below.  Thanks for looking and let me know if you have any questions.

  This is a large majority of my firearms collection. I have decided to consolidate after realizing that I am only one man and can only shoot one gun at a time. To the same respect, I'm looking to shoot more often on fewer platforms. Restricting myself to only higher quality, higher end pieces. If I diminish my collection from many to few, I want those few to be the very best out there at what they do. I like to think of myself as a VERY diverse shooter. I enjoy the sport of shooting and am open to many different venues, situations, and purposes: Home Defense, Competition, Target, Etc. With that being said...My goal is to trade up, not to sell. I have no problem offering multiple firearms in exchange for one, as long as the VALUE and QUALITY is there. Every firearm I own is in excellent condition or brand new. Nothing on this list is below 95%+ condition and most are way above (unless noted). The prices listed next to each piece are fair middle ground prices. I could start high with the expectation to be bartered with, but why not skip all the BS and cut to the chase. Please do not contact me expecting to be able to pay the lowest price listed, as again, I'm not really looking to sell. I understand that due to location and demographic, the values I have listed may be lower or higher then what is available in your area. I would like to think I am a reasonable person. If you believe I'm too low or too high please let me know and depending on what you're offering we may be able to work something out. I'm not in any hurry to get rid of any piece so please no low ball offers. I'm looking for straight value for value here. If you believe your offer to have higher than expected value, please explain why. That is why I'm here, to get the best of the best.
