This gun was imported by Interarms in Virginia, which puts this back before rossi was bought by Taurus, meaning this gun was most likely manufactured in the 80's or early 90's at the latest. It is very acurate and has a smooth action. The only thing wrong with it is that it hiccups occasionally on double action. The cylinder will rotate, but the firing pin will not strike.

This is a Swedish Mauser in 6.5x55mm.  As you can see in the pic it is in pieces.  I picked it up many years ago from some one that started it and dident get very far and I did even less so its time to move on to the next person.  I do not know if everything is there and some of the parts do have some rust on them but all the important parts  like the action, barrel, bolt, trigger (both origional and aftermarket Timney)  are there.  I will ONLY do  a local FTF  sale in TUCSON.    

I want to add  if you are looking to ""restore""  this to its origional condition this is NOT the rifle for you .  If you are looking to make a nice shooter or hunting rifle this IS the rifle for you.    Also  I have no problem with you wanting to see the gun first.  However,  if your are thinking that once you  get there you can offer a lower price and I will take it that is NOT the case.  The price is firm.  This is NOT the swap meet, I will not hagle.   So dont try to insult me with a $50 or $60  offer.   The aftermarket Timney trigger alone is worth more than that!"

Vortex Ranger 1000 Rangefinder RRF-101 makes accurately assessing distances an easy task, even when you're perched in a tree stand or trying to compensate for angle.

An incredibly intuitive menu makes it easy to navigate the various features of the rangefinder, which is equipped with fully multi-coated optics for high light transmission and O-ring sealed for water proofing. The Vortex Ranger 1000 Horizontal Component Distance Range Finder can be used in the previously mentioned HCD mode, as well as a Line of Sight (LOS) mode and a Scan mode that judges distances in real time while panning across a landscape or tracking game. Vortex Optics has built the Ranger 1000 for durability, with a compact design and rubber non-slip armoring. What's more, the hunting rangefinder is easy to carry by hanging it from the included lanyard or clipping it to your pocket or belt with the included utility clip. For an intuitive, highly accurate range finder adapted for hunters, bring along the Vortex Ranger 1K Three-Mode Hunting Range-Finder.

The bottom-eject on these Ithacas make them appealing to both right- and left-handed shooters. These also make great home defense guns because they are so easy to operate, and the safety is right by the trigger finger instead of on top of the tang like most modern guns. These older Ithacas are really nice all-around shotguns and they just don't make them like this anymore.

The Ruger LC9 is a very compact and thin pistol that is perfect for concealed carry or back-up gun duties. Playing off of the incredibly popular LCP pistol, Ruger has chambered this pistol in the potent 9mm cartridge.
 The LC9 is a double-action only (DAO) pistol, fired by hammer, not striker. The pull is smooth, but not heavy.
 Super thin, this pocket gun is only 0.9"" wide. Seemingly impossible, the LC9 weighs only 17.1 ounces, yet still has a 3.12"" barrel, a 7+1 capacity and real, three dot sights.
 The LC9 frame is made of a high-performance, glass-filled nylon, while the slide and barrel are steel. The frame is black, and the slide is blued."

The only reason I am getting rid of it is because I finally got an H&K P7M8 that I use all the time, and never shoot the walther anymore.

I *MIGHT* bend a little on price, but probably not too much.  Its in great shape, and the extra mags and grip extensions make it very valuable.  I might consider selling it cheaper without the full size mags and grip extensions.

These pistols were contracted to Spain for the Nazi military. Approx. 60,000 were produced, but due to the Allied invasion of France, only the first 10,500 were delivered to the Germans. The rest of them ended up in storage until the end of the war. After WWII, the West German government needed to arm the police, and remembered the pistols in Spain. The Spanish forced them to repurchase them, even though the Nazi government had already paid for them . In effect, these guns were purchased twice. This pistol was made in 1944, with a 26xxx serial number. It comes with two original magazines and a issue holster. The gun fires standard 9mm Luger, and is in great mechanical condition. All serial numbers match, the mags are not numbered. There is slight holster wear on the high spots, but less than you would commonly expect for a gun of it's age. 85 to 90 % original bluing. No import marks. The bore is mirror bright. It is an accurate, well made pistol. Holster has faint ""Geco"" makers mark. A interesting piece of WWII history, and a good shooter.

Interested in nazi stampings, Chinese/ nap stampings and/or single rounds. Sorry but I'm not buying a box of ammo I only need one of to put in my display case unless the whole box is the same price I would pay for just one bullet. Also interested in Arabic or other non English lettering head stamps or any stamps that are from hostile armies. 


Of course still interested in american/NATO rounds I don't yet have in my collection. Wildcat cartridges, need a 5.6x28, 300winmag, 300 blackout, 456 rigby. 458SOCOM, any of the 500 rounds.

I also want to complete my collection of .22 caliber rounds. 

Just because its common doesnt mean I have it, there's no order to what I have so if you have a spare round or 2 and don't have the gun anymore and would take a few dollars for it offer it, I'm not gonnahi peoples :) 
i need some advice please, 
my partner wants to try sounding and i have no idea what to do. 
Ive never tried it before and can not find much info on the net except places to buy sounds, but we have already purchased one. 
we have got a van buren dilator set. 

is there any tips that people could give me on what to do, i know that you need to use a lot of lube (we have a good quality one) 
and the equipment needs to be serialized . 
the only way i know how to serialize objects is by boiling them, but i am unsure if this would be the correct thing to do with sounds . 

i have also read that if you are going to try something on someone to try it on yourself first, but i have the same problem of not knowing what im doing and i do know that male and female sounds are different shapes, well i have read anyway. 
please help 
kindest regards Kylie
 care if you offer something I already have so shoot me all offers. 

Please don't offer me your collection, my son and I do this together and it's no fun to buy a complete collection.  Not saying I won't buy multiple rounds from one person, but last time I posted this I had a few people offer my their entire collection already in a nice display for hundreds of dollars, that's the only thing I'm not interested in."

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

This is the ONLY year that these great shooting Alloy Framed 'Kit' Guns were produced in this barrel length, so not many available.
 Also; this one has the early indexing system soon dropped by the bean counters in favor of a less costly method of manufacture, & so has a smoother action than later years.
 This is a fun little revolver that is very light, and fires almost like an auto!
It is very accurate too! 
 The grips were based on the Colt Pocket guns of the 19th Century and were called 'the most comfortable grip' since the Civil War'.
 I've seen this model go for big money, but this one is 'well broken in' & is priced accordingly. it has the usual scuffs from the early style springless ejector, and wear consistent with it's age, but shoots perfectly & never shaves lead.
 If you are looking for something rare, exotic, & fun- let me know. I can send details & pics."

This  gun is chambered in 40S&W. 

I am including
-Five 10 round Hi-Point mags
-A soft carrying case
-300+ rounds of 40 S&W ammo. 250 rounds are UMC range ammo. About 50 rounds are Hornady Critical Duty and Critical Defense. 20 rounds of Hornady Zombie Max JHP and about 20 rounds of misc FMJ.

*I can email photos!*
*At $180.00, if you break everything down, you are getting the gun for $80.00 and the ammo for $110.00.*
I am not sure what a new stock from Hi-Point costs, but it shouldn't be too expensive. I paid $299.99 for the gun 3 months ago. The ammo, if bought at Walmart would cost you over $130.00. Just the 250 UMC bullets cost me $79.85 at Walmart, all the other ammo was bought at either  ShootStraight or Tims Guns.

Buds gun shop which is the lowest price you can find for guns lol sells the blued used Colt Gold Cup for 950, so a used stainless is well worth $1000 then you have the mag well, extended safety and release, guide rod, beavertail grip safety, extended mag release and wrap around grips is valued at well over $150 not including the price to install them.  The 8 rd Power mags are the best 1911 mags around and they sell for $25 each plus shipping, the 10rd tactical mags sell for $28 each plus shipping, plus you get 5 brand new Wilson Combat recoil springs valued at $5 each and 2 holsters plus all the original factory parts.  So for one of the best 1911 and most accurate you can get with all these extra I say for $1300 you are getting a great deal."

Remington has introduced the first ""Tactical"" pump 20 Gauge into the market which comes with a 2 round extension tube giving you 6+1 rounds with an 18"" barrel. Why a tactical 20 Gauge instead of 12? because you get almost the same wound/pattern/penetration with a lot less recoil. 

I've got it priced cheaper than you can buy it new with tax so you have to decide if you want it or not, not if I can pricing low enough to make you want it. That's a concept on armslist that a lot of people don't get. Also I'm not interested in any trades unless it's ammo. If you do have a trade, make sure it's worth more than mine to a degree that I could resell it for more than $400."
