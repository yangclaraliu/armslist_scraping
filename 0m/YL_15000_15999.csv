This is probably one of the smoothest firing handguns that I have ever used. I have fired this gun only 500 times and there wasn't a single problem. The only reason I am wanting to sell is because I am trying to get a smaller, more concealable firearm. Then gun has been kept in the case when not in use and cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range. The Taurus has little to no recoil when firing and is a great gun for beginners who may be hesitant at firing. I was able to teach my parents how to shoot for the first time and they enjoyed using this gun. The gun has a soft rubber handgrip that makes firing for long periods of time comfortable.

The following is the manufacturer's description:

Gas Piston systems operate cleaner then the direct gas impingement operating systems. With the piston system, the propellant gases that are being diverted at the gas block are now vented at the gas block, instead in the operating system of the upper receiver. Since the fouling from the gas system is not being vented in to the action of your firearm, it stays cooler and cleaner. Our system is designed around the short stroke piston operation. The piston pushes the anti tilt one piece carrier, which unlocks the bolt and allows the piston to return home while the bolt carrier continues to cycle independently.

The upper is built off of our standard forged A3 receiver with M4 feed ramps. The chrome plated gas piston is mounted in a solid one piece steel gas block attached to the barrel by pins. The dedicated, piston specific, anti-tilt bolt carrier is one piece, machined with the piston impingement key(not a bolt on). The carrier uses our standard Mil-Spec bolt. The barrel is our 4140 steel, M4 profile, 5.56mm chamber and bore, 1/9 twist ratio and 1/2x28 threaded barrel and our proprietary WASP surface treatment. The upper is finished with M4 handguard caps, M4 handguards and an A2 flash hider installed with a crush washer.

The piston gas block has a gas shut off setting for use with a suppressor to allow for maximum noise reduction. You must replace the crush washer with a peel washer if you plan to mount your suppressor on the original flash hider. Fits on any standard Mil-Spec lower receiver. All uppers have been factory head spaced and test fired. There are no upgrade options available with this model."

These come with flip up grenade launcher sights and flip up front night sights (no tritium inserted) and slant muzzle break. Features a stamped receiver with 1.6mm thickness and heavier barrel than most other AK's. I have had 3 Romanian WASR-10 AK's and this is BY FAR a more superior gun. 7.62X39. This is a great AK. Also comes 30 round steel mag and sling. Will meet for a FTF in Burlington/Greensboro area or will ship for $50 (I ship with full insurance). *Gun comes with the original grip (not pictured) and not with the CAA grip in picture. I can add the CAA grip for an additional $30 if you want. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Have one USA 30 round AR-15 .223 magazine by O'Kay Industries, Inc., New Britain, Conn.

This AR is in great shape and supreme working order. I had it fully serviced (new parts, fired & cleaned) by a gunsmith at Anderson's Gun Repair Shop here in Springfield, MO before putting it up for sale; new extractor spring & gas tube (had a dent in the tube which slowed the gas pressure). I also run some 40 rounds through it and cleaned it. It was flawless.

I've had this same rifle (but fully auto - M16) issued to me during the latter part of the Vietnam conflict (U.S. Army 1971-74). I hate to part with this, but with the times as they are now I would prefer a much larger caliber for home defense. Not worried about whether or not you can hunt with it.

Let me know what you have and I'll see if we can come to an agreement."

The GSG-5, a semi-auto .22 LR patterned after the famed MP5 submachinegun, was all the rage at last year's SHOW Show. And justly so; the German-made carbine slavishly replicated the subgun, down to the accessories and stocks available for it. This year brings the introduction of the GSG-5PK, a pistol variant patterned after the MP5K machine pistol. Also chambered in .22 LR, the PK is great fun to shoot, and, unlike the full-sized GSG-5, its four-or-so inch barrel also happens to be easy to suppress. If you would like to come look at it let me know...Thanks Kevin  840-9486"

The GSG-5, a semi-auto .22 LR patterned after the famed MP5 submachinegun, was all the rage at last year's SHOW Show. And justly so; the German-made carbine slavishly replicated the subgun, down to the accessories and stocks available for it. This year brings the introduction of the GSG-5PK, a pistol variant patterned after the MP5K machine pistol. Also chambered in .22 LR, the PK is great fun to shoot, and, unlike the full-sized GSG-5, its four-or-so inch barrel also happens to be easy to suppress If you would like to take a look at it call me at 840-9486 My name is Kevin"

This Bersa has the brushed nickel finish.  It is a fantastic shooting pistol, maybe the most accurate stock pistol I've ever shot.  I'm going away from 9mm altogether though, so this one needs a new home.  The gun is in very good condition except for a little nickel flaking off the chamber, the slide/frame/controls have no flaking and are in very good shape.  This is not one of the newest Thunder9's with the accessory rail. Pistol will come with one 17round magazine, no box, no papers.  

Also offering the following ammunition:

5 boxes (250 rounds) CCI Blazer 9mm. 115gr fmj. 
1 box (50) Federal 9mm.  115gr fmj.
1 box (100 round)  Winchester white box 9mm.  115gr fmj.
appx 50 loose various fmj 9mm, some 124gr, some 115.

I'd like to sell the gun and ammo to the same person.  I'd take $325.00 for everything: pistol and all the ammunition.  I'd sell the pistol alone for $250.00.  I'd ship the pistol to a dealer out of state, but it will cost $50.00 (I've had people ask about this).  I'd consider the ammo by itself only after the pistol is gone.  Not interested in shipping ammo. Below is a link to the exact same pistol.  This is a great deal on a great pistol.  Trades considered *1911 stuff, AR stuff, or whatever else.  Thanks for looking.

In great shape. Fewer than 500 rds through it. This gun is a blast to shoot.

NOTE: Last round of magazine will often feed improperly; fixed quickly by easing pressure on slide and letting round fall into place. I suspect this is a design flaw on these big rigs, though maybe a good gunsmith could smooth it out. I got used to it, but you should know before buying. All other operations flawless.
