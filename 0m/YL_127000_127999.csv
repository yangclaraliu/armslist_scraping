Sig Sauer 8 + 1 Round 9MM w/Night Sights/Black Finish

The P239 was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of ""performance engineering"" and it's one of the keys to all Sig Sauer pistols. Supplied with 1 magazine.

It comes with 4 factory mags (2 8rd and 2 7rd), the Hogue grip on it, the original Sig grip, and the case and paperwork. I got it in a trade and was told it had about 470rds thru it; I've put 50 thru it flawlessly. It has night-sights, but the front is just about dead and the rear is dimming. This one is stamped ""Made in Germany"", not West Germany as others I've seen. Don't know what the difference is, but that's what it says. It's a great gun, but I shoot my Glock 21 much better so this will just sit in the safe.
I'm mainly looking for a cash sale, but will entertain offers for something more concealable in .40s&w or .45acp.(No 1911's)

Scope $129

Extra mags $25 each (when you can find them that cheap)

4 mag pouch and scope cover $50 (the pouch is getting very hard to find.

I bought my first real gun and no longer have any desire to keep these. they are perfectly legal, i will just need to see an ID to make sure you are 18. but no bill of sale (for according to ATF, these are NOT actual 'firearms'). I am looking for 250 for both of these, for they do come with 6 blank shells, cleaning utensils for the blank firing gun, 2 CO2 cartridges and a few bb's for the BB gun, and a really nice case for the both of them.

It has a mid 40's Springfield Garand receiver they refinished, that again is not a reweld job that is unsafe to fire. Very few were made at the very beginning before they moved over to the much cheaper and plentiful cut up receivers that were so common. Is functionally identical to a semi-auto Beretta BM-59 except made in America. Every part is either Garand or BM-59 GI issue. Has the standard dings for an older rifle in the safe, only noticeable issues are looks like a shooter had a ring on his right hand while shooting that left some dings, and the crappy paint Beretta used on the ext of the gas tube is wearing. A Beretta import BM59 seem to be going for about 2500-3500 when available. This is an affordable alternative to own a cool piece of history in the m-14 family development."

Looking for a shooter, not a collector's item.  Must have original chrome-lined Warsaw Pact milspec barrel from original manufacturer, no US-made barrels please.  A WASR2 or SAR2 would be acceptable IF and only IF its sights and gas tube are straight and milsurp mags fit and feed properly, which are very big IFs with any Century product, as I'm sure you know.  Prefer to have the optics mount block on the left side of the receiver already installed.  Prefer fixed stocks but willing to consider triangle folders or AK100 series folders if the price is right.  No ""Planet of the Apes"" thumbhole sporters, please.

Anything else is negotiable, but keep in mind that I'm looking for a shooter, not a collector's item.

Edited to add:  looking for FTF private sale in Michigan ONLY.  Looking for a 5.45mm AK ONLY.  Reading is fundamental, kids.

Now use your rifle scope or iron sights..your scope stays fixed! The Ironsighter design by J.B. Holden places the two base elements (one piece each) exactly where gunmakers intended a base to go...over the bore....in the standard drilled and tapped holes. The finely machined Ironsighter base units form one half of the scope ring to cradle the scope in perfect, stationary alignment. The base design ads just 1/8"" to scope height over conventional top mounts. No drilling is required if your rifle has been drilled and tapped by the manufacturer. Standard rifle mounts design to hold 1"" diameter scopes in precision-machined grip. So you get easy, instant scope sighting, plus instant use of the iron sights! With the top caps secured, your scope is seated positively to the base. Nothing slips, slides or flips, remember? So, you get a solid-as-a-rock, as accurate a mount for your scope as you will find anywhere, at any price. Model 225 is quality made by J.B. Holden Co., Plymouth, Michigan. Precision manufactured using the finest materials. This is not a cheap import! It was made to sell at nearly $30.00. This see-thru mount assembly is in its original factory box.

Beretta 8 + 1 Round 380 ACP Pistol w/Black Finish & Plastic Grips

Made in Italy

 These medium frame pistols deliver .380 (9mm short) power in a personal-size package and maintain the reliability, safety and performance features of Beretta's legendary 92FS. The Cheetah pistols feature an open slide design that increases the reliability of the firearm. The frame is made from an aluminum alloy that delivers the strength and durability of steel, but with 65% less weight. The automatic firing pin block (F models) prevents the gun from firing in case of inadvertent drops or strikes against hard surfaces. Features such as these, and the built-in reliability and quality, make the Cheetah a natural for personal defense and an ideal back-up pistol for law enforcement professionals.

It comes in the original box with everything as it was from the factory. This model comes with both a pistol grip and a full size stock.

Sight is in excellent condition and works well. I had this on an FN/FAL but removed it to mount a higher power optic. A very interesting and historic optic...downward pointer/reticle is very unique but offers some advantages when you think about it. I tried to take a picture through the sight so you can see the reticle. It is hard to take a picture through a scope. LOL But you get the idea. This is an awesome combat sight but I decided to put a long range optic on my FN/FAL. You do not see these sights very much anymore. They are becoming rare to say the least.  If you have an FN/FAL or FAL copy then this is the classic military optic for your gun. This does not have the red lighted reticle.  Those normally cost more than double what I am asking for this one. I am open to trades for like items. Optics, scopes, range optics, range equipment, hunting equipment, ect.

with a raised Trillion Cut( http://www.diamondsonweb.com/information/trillion-cut-diamonds.mhtml ) Center stone .4 Carats. Can you say big?
All stones are eye clean and I was unable to see inclusions with a 10X jewelers loop. Not a professional so I won't try and tell you the actual clarity measurements. Center stone is complimented by 7 .085 carat (approx) diamonds in channel setting positioned with the corners up and down so they all touch corners in a a line. There is even a diamond under the main stone that increases the incredible fire the main stone already has. Ring comes with a Lifetime Rhodium plating and diamond warranty from Kay Jewelers. This is very useful being that a rhodium dip is around $30 right now and the average ring needs dipped every 6 months of wear to keep the luster. That alone saves you $60 a year that is $600 in ten years!!! This ring was a limited production ""showcase ring"" very few of these were made by Kay Jewelers, very hard to find another like it. Would hold onto it but my wife wants to take up shooting as a hobby so we are looking to get some start up cash to do so. If you want to see the ring we can meet at Kays in the mall or another similar neutral place. More pics available.
