It has a bipod quick detach mount, and an adjustable stock. The stock is the skeleton type and is just like the Choate tactical stocks. It has spacers to adjust length of pull and it has a built in monopod to adjust it for height when bench shooting. This Gun is practically new. I just purchased it 3-4 months ago along with 3 boxes of ammo. I have shot  43 rounds through it.. and the remaining 17 rounds come with the gun.
The Scope I installed on it is the Cabelas Pine Ridge 6-18x40 tactical turret and It has side focus. It also Includes seven turrets in varmint/predator calibers 
and compensates for bullet drop out to 400 yards and beyond .
I also replaced the stock picatinny rail with a Talley one piece high scope mount to clear the hammer.
The scope has been installed correctly by  lapping in the rings and was properly torqued with a Wheeler fat wrench.
The Bi-pod in the picture does not come with the rifle, as it goes to my Ar15 and I installed it on this rifle for pictures only.
I am selling the rifle with remaining ammo & scope for $450.00
I would consider keeping the scope and talley mount and sell the rifle with the remaining 17 rounds of ammo & the stock pictanny rail for $300.00 

It will come with the original Box and paperwork/manuals that it came with  from H&R/Marlin and it will come with the scopes box along with the other turrets.
Please ,no ""low ballers"". Im only selling this  to finish a custom Mauser project I have going on.

by rtipton » Mon Dec 12, 2011 9:44 pm 

I have an immaculate Browning A-Bolt Eclipse in .270 WSM. It has a laminated, thumbhole stock with a heavy barrel. The trigger is one of the finest I have ever felt. It does have the 60 degree bolt throw for short and fast bolt action.

It has the Browning floorplate system that has a removeable 4-shop clip...VERY nice for hunting. 

I put one box of shells through it to sight it in - it is an incredibly accurate rifle. 

I would be glad to let the Weaver bases that are on it go along with the rifle, if you would like. I also have a brand-new box of Winchester Ballistic silvertips for it.

This model DOES NOT have the BOSS system. 

I am asking $750. Feel free to email me (REDACTED), contact me on here or call/text REDACTED.

This is a double action only .380 with a built in laser.  Comes with Smith box, lock, adjustment tool and a zippered range pouch plus the factory fired casing and some other misc. stuff that comes with the gun.  It is just as good as buying a new one from a dealer.

PRICE IS FIRM AT $380

Best price you will find on a new one is $339-$349 plus tax then an additional $25-$30 per mag and I am including 2 at my price.

Best total you will find out the door is probably around $425 so if you would rather go that route then you should do that instead of wasting your time e-mailing me because I cannot take less than $380.

I priced it to sell so if you offer less I will not respond.

MUST GO!!,"china grove, North Carolina, United States",$ 0,"Listed On: Wednesday, December 14, 2011",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is my entire autograph collection. I have spent many years putting this collection together. I have collected autographs since I was a kid and I have enjoyed the hobby for many years. Now, my time with this great collection has passed. Over time, I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on this collection. The majority of my collection consists of vintage baseball autographs such as Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams, Joe Dimaggio, Ty Cobb, Roger Maris, and many more vintage baseball stars. All of my autographs have been authenticated and all come with certificates of authenticity. Below is a list of every item in my collection. You will also see a value for what each item typically sales for. These are not my asking prices. The total value of the collection is approximately $24,265. This is not my asking price. I am only asking $3,500 for the entire collection. I know I am taking a huge loss but I am in a must sell situation. My wife and I have found a piece of property that we are interested in purchasing but we need a larger down payment. So we do not miss the opportunity to buy our dream home. As I said, this is a must sell situation so I will listen to all reasonable offers. I was asking $5,500 for the entire collection. I have dropped my price by $2,000 because we really need to sell the entire collection as soon as possible. This is really going to be an amazing deal for someone. You will not find a nicer collection at a better price. I have thousands more invested in this collection than my asking price. I am taking a huge loss on this collection. I really hate to see this great collection go but I honestly have no other choice. We really need the money right now. My loss is your gain. This would be a great investment opportunity for someone. This would even be great for someone that sells on ebay. You could list these items for sale individually and you could make a large profit if you just have the time. We do not have the time to do this. We need this collection gone as soon as possible. With Christmas right around the corner, this would also make an amazing Christmas gift for the baseball fan in your family. This collection will not last long at this price. If you have any questions or would like to make an offer, please feel free to contact me by email. Thanks for looking.

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster.

Every component of your Leupold Mark 4 LR/T variable power riflescope is working together to help you make every shot count, whether you’re at the range, hunting, or in a tactical environment.

Features:

- The illuminated Mil Dot or Tactical Milling Reticle (TMR) allows for precision shot placement in low light, and is night-vision compatible.
- These reticles are ideal in tactical situations, yet also provide greater accuracy of range estimation for hunters and target shooters.
- The Xtended Twilight Lens System optimizes the transmission of low-light wavelengths, so you see the details of low-light scenes in greater, brighter detail than with any other riflescope available.
- Side focus parallax adjustment for fast, easy parallax focusing from 75 yards to infinity, from any shooting position.
- Finger-adjustable ¼-MOA windage and elevation adjustments with audible, tactile clicks.
- Once sighted in adjustment knobs can be zeroed.
- The 30mm maintube offers incredible strength and allows for the greater range of windage and elevation adjustment.
- 75-MOA of elevation adjustment and 70-MOA of windage adjustment. 
- Flip-open lens covers are standard issue with each Mark 4 LR/T riflescope.
- Rugged and absolutely waterproof, LR/T riflescopes can withstand incredible abuse.
- Leupold's third-generation illumination will keep you on target like never before. They have boosted performance with a 15 percent brighter reticle, 8 different intensity settings, an innovative motion sensor, and a redesigned, user-friendly interface.

The GSSF Commemorative Glock was released in 2001 through and for the Glock Shooting Sports Foundation. Only members were allowed to order, and they were sold at the same price as direct sales to officers . These 1000 pistols were to commemorate the 10th Anniversary of the organization which Glock, Inc. set up to encourage the use of Glock pistols in a competition that would not be dominated by professional shooters. For more info on GSSF go to [link]. Another unique thing about the GSSF Glock is that they do not have the ""US"" at the end of the serial number. Presumably, this was in order to fit the organization's initials into the serial number."

This is the SG built to run not only the standard 2.75"" shells, but also the devastating 3"" Magnum loads. Starting on the reliable, tough-as-nails 870 Express Magnum frame, has been upgraded with the following...

Hogue ""Tamer"" pistol grip assembly. (designed to ease the hit from Magnum load shells)
Hogue Fore grip.
Mossberg 18"" Tac barrel.
Mag extension, to 7+1 capacity. (tube dimples smoothed, NOT drilled)

This is not an over done ""Tacti-cool"" boat anchor. I like em simple, useable, & effective. Short & light enough to be easily portable(I tuck it between the seat and console in my car regularly). Increased the capacity, & improved the ergos. The only thing I may add soon would be a side saddle shell holder.

Also, comes with all the OE hunting gear, all in like-new condition. Wood grip/stock, wood fore grip, 26"" vent-beam hunting long barrel, birdshot plug. Basically, two shotguns in one!  :) 

Come with a nice stock of ammo as well.

You can throw me a cash offer, but I'd really prefer to do some trading.

While we all prefer US Made products, the competitor to the Rossi, New England Firearms, does not match performance with their single shot rifles against Rossi's in the bean fields of West Tennessee and Northeast Mississippi. From several years of reports from our local customers, the NEF Center Fire single shots produced in the last two decades do not perform as well as their H&R predecessors, and that is also the case against the well made Brazilian Rossi Single Shots. While neither will match a 700 Remington, we're talking about silver dollar or half dollar size groups for the Rossis against cigarette-pack 4-5 inch groups with the NEFs. Our interest in the Rossis takes into account their traditional Brazilian Goncalo hardwood stocks and forends, attractive traditional finishes. Not just those two counts, but also the side mounted lever safeties on the Rossis, and the patented Taurus hammer locks. The flat-faced tempered steel Rossi triggers simply do not exhibit creep and mush like their NEF competitors, and they come with scope mount base included. These specimens are chambered in the venerable and popular .243 Winchester, highly effective on our abundant coyote, deer, and ground hog population, all three the bane of soybean farmers throughout our whole region, more so down in the Delta lands. These weigh in at a well balanced 7 3/4 pounds unscoped, and their center of gravity is about 3 inches forward of the receiver, and even nearer to the receiver with some scope weight.  Rate of twist on the 23 inch heavy barrel is 1:10, normal for the caliber. This Rossi's chief competitor, the H&R Handi-Rifle, is not as accurate, not nearly as well balanced, and prices out at $300 apiece or more. We're offering these fine Rossi Heavy Barrel .243 rifles, the one in the photo or one of its identical mates, each for only	$ 239.00.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $20 flat fee lower 48 states; $50 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, UPS Ground with full insurance coverage.

For as long as they have been on the market, we have had excellent service experience, and suitable accuracy experience, with the Rossi Single Shots imported by Taurus-Held Company Braztech in Miami. Brazilian rifle and handgun workmanship has always been excellent. This is a Rossi – Braztech Single Shot Rifle in .243 Remington; and photos show a specimen we had in stock. The stock and forend appear to be walnut, but we are not absolutely certain about that. Factory specs are as follows: Taurus catalog number R243MB; caliber .243 Winchester; break-open single shot action; single stage trigger; transfer bar and manual lever safeties with Taurus lock system; 23 inch barrel; Weaver base & no rear sight; overall length 38 ½ inches; weight empty 6 ¼ pounds; Brazilian Walnut stock. This rifle comes with a Weaver type scope base and hammer extension for scope mounting, as well as two keys for its internal lock, the same type lock that comes on Rossi and Taurus Revolvers. If someone wants see-thru over/under scope rings on one of these, get ready to spend $50 on a set of higher sights because the iron sights on this rifle are low profile and very sturdy and compact. Competitor H&R Handi Rifles, from our local experience, are more prone to misfire, less accurate, heavier, and less well balanced. The H&Rs command prices of $300 apiece or more in our area. We’re offering the light, well-balanced, reliable and accurate Rossi Braztech in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates,          each for only           $ 219.00.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $20 flat fee lower 48 states; $50 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, UPS Ground with full insurance coverage.

Photos show one of the first specimens we got of Rossi Braztech’s new M830, named model Rio Grande Lever Action Shotgun. Although the history goes all the way back to the Winchester Model of 1883, this Rossi is more heavily indebted to John Marlin than to Oliver Winchester. The Weaver type scope base sitting atop this Rio Grande’s receiver emphasizes that fact as much as anything. That base is removable, of course, and it, the cross-receiver hammer safety, and the 1 inch recoil pad are the only 20th century trappings to this rifle. Styling is traditional repeating or lever action rifle type, only chambered for .410 gauge, 2 1/2 inch, shotshells. Construction is blue steel, and the barrel measures 20 inches, gently rifled for accurate use of slugs, but not enough pronounced rifling to interfere with Shotshells or even buckshot. Company does not advise whether .45 Colt Ammunition is at all feasible; probably not. Capacity is 5 + 1 rounds of .410 gauge, 2 1/2 inch shells; this shotgun is not 3 inch capable. Sights are traditional buckhorn type with step elevator dovetailed-in rear and dovetailed blade front with brass tip. Weight empty is 5.8 pounds, balanced just forward of the lever mount strut on the receiver. Overall length is 38.9 inches, and length of pull is a very adult 13 7/8 inches from the face of the blue steel trigger to the end of the buttpad. Buttstock and forend are traditional walnut-finished Brazilian hardwood. One sees Winchester 9410 shotguns advertised at prices approaching $1500 per unit.

The Ruger GP-100 has always been a top quality performer for us. This is Ruger’s answer to the Smith & Wesson 686 and, of course, the late Colt Python. Ruger has its advantages for ruggedness and it will ignite anybody’s primer. Note the massive frame top strap, shown in the photos. Ruger has roughly twice as much steel at that crucial stress point as any of its competitors at any time.

Here is the latest variant of an excellent and economical 9mm pistol, Smith & Wesson's incursion into Glock Territory, the Sigma Series Center Fire SW9VE, product Code #220025, in stainless steel and polymer. The Sigmas, like their Glock parents, have no manually operated safety, but they do include the highly important firing pin block safety that prevents accidental firing if the weapon is dropped. It is double action only, a long steady pull on every shot; barrel length is 4 inches; 3 dot sights; 24.3 oz weight empty. Each SW9VE pistol comes with a total of two 10-round stainless body magazines yielding a 11 round capacity.  The standard SW9VE will, of course, accept 16 round magazines, but those are not legal for civilians in several jurisdictions of the United States. This variant is fresh production with the new one piece boxes with insert protector and traditional Smith & Wesson Nox paper. Replacement price on these in our area is $400 or more. We're offering the SW9VE in the photos,  however, or one of its identical mates, each 		for only	$ 319.00.		For any buyers who may not want the 10 round magazines, $25 off and no magazines. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $10 lower 48; $30 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority Mail, insured with Delivery Confirmation.

Here is a recent revival of a very popular revolver, not only for both defense minded civilians and law enforcement professionals, but also for those of us who are interested in collectability.  This is the 442-2, named model .38 Centennial Airweight, but its model number should be 442-1, since it is identical to the 442-1 model that enjoyed a production run from 1996, with the introduction of the +P rated J-Magnum frame, until 2002 when the common variant 442-2 with internal lock carried on the matte blue steel and alloy production. Photo specimen shows one from a Smith & Wesson limited run of 442-2 No Locks, Product Code #150544,  furnished with the newer, slicker factory boot type short combat rubber grips presently on almost all lightweight J frames. As far as basic features, the Model 442 is full-time double action; since the hammer is completely enclosed inside the frame. For personal protection, many veteran law enforcement officers and firearms instructors recommend this model 442-2, since the Centennial cannot be fired in single action mode, where a person cocks the hammer and then pulls the trigger. It is an exceedingly dangerous situation when a homeowner hears a noise and immediately backs the hammer on any revolver. This configuration has long been very popular and, in our opinion, vastly less dangerous than many of its semi-automatic peers. In spite of its light weight, it is rated to withstand the pressure from +P, high-velocity proof-load .38 Special ammunition. Furthermore, given the state of the handgun market and consequent prices, we believe the Lightweight J-frame Smith & Wessons are among the best values in firearms. As far as Factory Specs, this revolver is .38 Special +P rated, double action only, 1 7/8 inch barrel, overall length 6 5/16 inches; aluminum alloy small frame J designation; satin stainless finish, Finger Grooved short rubber Boot Grip; serrated ramp front sight with fixed notch rear sight; internal hammer with locking mechanism; .312 width smooth Metal Injected Molded trigger; 5 shot capacity. We're offering these fine revived Centennials in limited quantities, brand new in their boxes with fired brass, 	 each	for only	$ 389.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California or the District of Colombia.  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $10 lower 48; $30 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority Mail, insured with Delivery Confirmation.

Remington 11-87 Sportsman 20 Gauge, YOUTH model, 3 inch chamber, 21 inch Vent rib barrel, black synthetic stock, and the Rem Choke interchangeable choke system. The Youth model is hard to find and has a 1 inch shorter stock than a standard Sportsman and the shorter barrel makes for a faster swinging shotgun.  

This gun has been used lightly by my son to hunt pheasants and deer.  It is in great shape.  He has outgrown the gun, but it was the best way to get him started that I could imagine.  The recoil is light, and without the ""kick"" factor, I think it helped him develop into a better shooter without the typical ""flinch"" you see as youth start hunting and shooting.   Photos can be e-mailed as requested. 

This is from the Remington site, and we would definately confirm it.
Young shooters are more likely to become stewards of the shooting sports if they start with a gun that fits properly. Exactly why we crafted our standard, premium-grade stocks with a shorter length of pull, then fit them to some of our finest firearms.

The gas-operated action of the 20-gauge Model 11-87™ Sportsman® Compact makes it the ultimate light-recoiling compact shotgun.

Key Features:
Ergonomically designed for superior handling 
Constructed with solid steel receivers for strength and durability 
Features smooth-operating actions that reduce wear and provide quick follow-up shots

I bought this from AIM surplus some years ago and it looks like the market price for it ranges right around $300.  I'd be willing to listen to reason if that's too high.

This is still liberally covered in commie cosmoline and will need some really nice cleaning.  The oak stock loos like it could be in good shape under all that.

The barrel has been cut down to 18 inches and threaded ½x28 to accept muzzle breaks, flash hiders, sound suppressors etc. It currently wears a recoil reducing muzzle break that takes all of the recoil away and makes this 7mm Magnum a pleasure to shoot. Has no kick but is extremely loud! Barrel is completely free floated and it has a detachable box magazine. All the metal on this gun has been media blasted and coated in bake on CERAKOTE. The color is Flat Dark Earth and if you don’t know what CERAKOTE is just research it. It is the strongest, toughest firearm coating on the planet and makes all other coatings look like water paint. All work has been professionally done. Never worry about rust again. I don’t hafta part with this rifle, so please no crazy low ball offers guys. Its not eating anything in the gun safe.

Gun is in very good shape with some wear from carry and no "" idiot mark "". It has some finish wear on the frame from a holster but its pretty minor and really no more than shiny spots in the grey finish. There is also some edge wear on the right side by the grip safety but again, not ugly, just honest wear from carry. Included is the factory box, 2 stainless KimPro mags and all manuals, packing materials and bushing wrench. It has Hogue finger groove grips on it and those are included in the asking price, but I also have a set of VZ 320 grips ( shown in the third picture ) that can go with the gun for an additional $50. The VZ gris are NOT included in my asking price
        I'm really looking to trade for a CCO or Champion/Commander sized 1911 and I strongly prefer Springfield. I may consider a 5"" gun if it has a lightweight frame and would also be interested in Kimber or S&W. Vances has the stainless Ultra Carry on sale for $869 so my price should be fair. Willing to meet around Columbus and buyers must be Ohio residents who can legally own this pistol"

  Revolver in the photo is one of only a few special edition variants of the S&W .38 Centennial Airweight Stainless. This a Talo special number, SKU 150957. Its grips are specially cut dark black gray laminate, somewhat on the order of the classic combat grips of the 1980s. This revolver left the factory on January 18, 2011. The named model of the revolver itself, of course, comes from its ancestor, the .38 Centennial Airweight introduced in the Company’s Centennial Year of 1952, a popular product descended from the experimental Air Crewman all-aluminum revolver of the early 1950s. Barrel, cylinder and parts are all stainless steel, integrated into a lightweight aluminum alloy frame, hence the 15 ounce light weight empty, down from 20-21 ounces for the steel J frame Smith & Wessons. The Centennial was introduced as a pocket revolver. Since its hammer is completely encased in the frame, there is no possibility of clothing snagging from the hammer spur. Action, then, is double action only; there is no way for the hammer to stand in single action. A distinct advantage to the Centennial is that an alarmed, armed homeowner will not be able to cock the revolver into single action when he or she hears a noise; but a steady deliberate pull of the trigger will fire the revolver with more certainty than any automatic ever produced. Smith & Wesson revolvers all have an internal transfer bar safety to guard against accidental discharge, and this 642-2 variant has the internal hammer lock, supplied with two keys, that puts it in compliance with all state laws, at least for the time being. The special edition grips allow a firm hold with minimal increase of the overall height or size of the small J frame. They are some of the most attractive, good feeling, and positive gripping stocks ever sold for the J Frame. Replacement price on these revolvers is now upwards of $600.00 in our area, if a person can even find one. We're offering the Talo Special 150957, 642-2 Centennial, in the photos however, or one of its identical mates, 		for only	$ 439.00.

Photos show a specimen of Smith & Wesson's newest Military & Police black gun series, the MP 9 Compact with manual ambidextrous lever safety, factory number 151118 variant with a total of two 12 round magazines, without magazine safety. This is an intensely popular pistol, over and above its Glock 19 Competitor and Progenitor, principally because it has a lock down ambidextrous manually operated safety. Specs are as follows. Weight empty, no magazine, is 21.7 oz; weight fully loaded will be a bit over 30 ounces. Overall length is 6.7 inches; 5 1/2 inch height; and very nice thin 1.2 inch width. Barrel length is 3 1/2 inches with a 5 3/4 inch sight radius. Sights are factory Three Dot, not night sights with tubes and radioactive material, but phosphor based dots that glow quite strongly and recharge themselves with light exposure, in a basic Novak style configuration. This pistol, like all M&Ps, is full time double action, striker fire action, with a very consistent 6.5 pound trigger pull that only travels .300 inches from rest to fire and resets in only .14 inches. Frame is Zytel Polymer, and barrel and slide are Black Melonite finished stainless. The frame, as the photos of the only specimen we have shows, incorporates a Picatinny Weaver type rail for light and laser mounting. Contrasting with its 206304 numbered variant, this M&P does not have a magazine safety, and it is so marked. That means that this pistol will fire a round with no magazine inserted. It is furnished with two factory 12 round magazines, as the photos show; one with finger rest and one flat plate. The M&P series takes all comers for ease of handling, positive feel, and reliability and consistency under the most adverse field and combat situations. M&P series has a fully ambidextrous magazine release setup; it is as easy to switch sides on it as a Beretta 92. This M&P 9 Compact variant commands retail prices in our area of $700 or more. We're offering the pistol in the photos, however, or one of its brand new identical mates 	for only	$ 489.00.		Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where the 12 round magazine are restricted, $ 40 off but no magazines. Includes Hawaii, New York, and Puerto Rico. 12 round magazines are not restricted in Chicago.

I wore it OC on my hip or carried it concealed in my purse for a couple of years, before my circumstances changed and I had to put it away. It never jammed or had any problems whatsoever. I used to go out to the range with friends and we'd take turns with each others guns and rifles. I've probably put around 200 rounds through it myself. It has wear marks and scratches on it, many of which it had when I purchased it (others are my own), but they don't take away from the functionality of the gun. I don't like to sell it but current circumstances have made that a necessity.

This is the faintly modified descendant of the 1955 Smith & Wesson Airweight Bodyguard, the model 638-3, current production 5-shot lightweight stainless .38 Special with the classic 2 inch barrel. With considerable demand for pocket revolvers in the 1950s, Smith & Wesson introduced its Centennial Model in 1952, but there was still demand for a pocket lightweight .38 that a person could still fire in single action mode, like the Airweight Chief's Special, only without the hammer spur snagging a person's pocket or purse upon drawing the weapon. The upper part of the frame, as the photos show, shield the hammer; but still exposes its cleat-serrated hammer spur enough to produce a cocking motion for precise single action firing. The lightweight stainless variant of the Airweight Bodyguard, the 638, was introduced as a limited run in 1989, then added as a regular part of the Smith & Wesson line in 1996, when Smith & Wesson beefed up the J-frame sufficiently for it to handle High Performance +P ammunition. This third, current variant of the 638 has a .312 MIM Metal-injected-Molded .312 smooth combat trigger and MIM flat-faced hammer with floating firing pin. All S&W Revolvers have an internal transfer bar safety that prevents accidental firing if a loaded weapon is dropped, and in 2002, the 638-3 entered the market with Smith & Wesson's patented internal lock. Barrel length is 1 7/8 inches, and this 5 shot pocket revolver only weighs 14 5/8 ounces empty. Grips are Smith & Wesson's new boot grip, softer rubber panels that give a surer grip without increasing the dimensions of the revolver. Smith & Wesson Product Code is 163070. These revolvers have always been fairly scarce, hardly ever more so than nowadays. Replacement price on them in our area, if a person can find one, is upwards of $600.00. We're offering the .38 Bodyguard Airweight Stainless model 638-3, the one in the photo or one of its identical mates, however	for only  	$ 369.00 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $10 lower 48; $30 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority Mail, insured with Delivery Confirmation.

Revolver in the photo is the most current configuration of the S&W .38 Centennial Airweight Stainless. Its name, of course, comes from its ancestor, the .38 Centennial Airweight introduced in the Company’s Centennial Year of 1952, a popular product descended from the experimental Air Crewman all-aluminum revolver of the early 1950s. Barrel, cylinder and parts are all stainless steel, integrated into a lightweight aluminum alloy frame, hence the 15 ounce light weight empty, down from 20-21 ounces for the steel J frame Smith & Wessons. The Centennial was introduced as a pocket revolver. Since its hammer is completely encased in the frame, there is no possibility of clothing snagging from the hammer spur. Action, then, is double action only; there is no way for the hammer to stand in single action. A distinct advantage to the Centennial is that an alarmed, armed homeowner will not be able to cock the revolver into single action when he or she hears a noise; but a steady deliberate pull of the trigger will fire the revolver with more certainty than any automatic ever produced. Smith & Wesson revolvers all have an internal transfer bar safety to guard against accidental discharge, and this 642-2 variant has the internal hammer lock, supplied with two keys, that puts it in compliance with all state laws, at least for the time being. Note the new-design Smith & Wesson factory boot grips that allow a firm hold without increasing the height or size of the small J frame. These revolvers also come in the new strong Smith & Wesson one piece boxes. Replacement price on these revolvers is now upwards of $600.00 in our area, if a person can even find one.

Has no kick but is extremely loud! Barrel is completely free floated and it has a detachable box magazine. All the metal on this gun has been media blasted and coated in bake on CERAKOTE. The color is Flat Dark Earth and if you don’t know what CERAKOTE is just research it. It is the strongest, toughest firearm coating on the planet and makes all other coatings look like water paint.

Actually a better gun than the old 1887 Remington that it was cloned from, this Norinco / Century Arms Coach gun is all blue steel, very sturdy, with American Walnut stock and forend. Barrels are 20 inch Cylinder Bore, wide open, and this shotgun has a tang safety as well as half-cock position for its hammers. We have sold China made Shotguns, Jin An and Norinco, now for over 20 years with excellent service experience, and we commend our Chinese friends on their expertise and workmanship on firearms. We refrain, however, from complimenting their packaging, normally any given one of these shotguns will have some sort of minor cosmetic flaw like the small dimple visible in the photo of the left side of the buttstock near the comb. These factors explain why this shotgun is $300 range, and its Italian competitors twice that much. These fine little shotguns weigh in at a healthy 8 pounds or so. Barrels are 20 inch blue steel, 2 3/4 inch chambers, Full Choke Right tube and Modified Left tube. The specimens we have miked gauge at .698 right tube and .685 left tube, definitely not for steel shot loads. Buttstock length of pull including their 3/8 inch thick rubber recoil pad is the standard 14 inches. While these are immensely popular in cowboy action shooting circles, they are also a fearsome weapon in their own right, always have been. In a current market climate where 8-shot Mossbergs are inflating to the $500 range, these are not only an excellent value, they are not only respectable competitors since the first shot, after all, is the most important in any scenario. These are also downright attractive. We're offering the one in the photo or one of its identical mates each for only	 $ 289.00.

I priced this out new at about $1994 after shipping. This price doesn't include any tax or transfer fees or anything. I got the prices from the vendors I originally ordered from which are the following:

BudsGunShop.com (Rifle, bipod, scope mount/rings)
StockyStocks.com (Stock and mag assembly)
TimneyTriggers.com (Trigger)
WebyShops.com (Scope)
PhoenixCustomRifles.com (Bolt Knob)

These were the cheapest vendors at the time but feel free to do your own research.

I would estimate that roughly 200 rounds have been fired through the rifle. Barrel is free floating. Bore is immaculate. Trigger pull is crisp and has almost zero travel. This thing is a tack driver.

I can include all original parts (stock, trigger, bottom metal).

I'M ASKING $1750 OR BEST OFFER. No lowballers. FTF in the Buffalo / Rochester area. I can include a Pelican 1750 case with uncut foam for an extra $150.

I would like to sell a brand new Rossi .223 Heavy Barrel Single Shot with Composite Stock and Forearm.  The rifle comes with a new Nikon 3x9 variable that has been laser bore sighted at 100 yards.  I put the Butler Creek flip up sight covers on as well.  Rifle comes with a nice adjustable heavy nylon sling and swivels.  I do not have the box but I have the manuals and receipt.

I bought the rifle at Dunhams last year for $200.00.  The scope was $189.00 at WalMart the next day.  Everything is new, unfired, no scratches just kept in a safe.  I am asking $250.00 OBO.  Great Coyote gun here for you.  I would trade for brand new Ruger Mini14 20 or 30 round mags.  I would have to have 6 of them to trade even.  Think about it and tell me what you have.

This was my first handgun that I purchased and I love it, the grip truly feels like a glove.  That is because it has not only an adjustable back strap, but also adjustable side panels that allow the handgun to truly form to your individual hand.  This gun is also completely ambidextrous, with a paddle mag release, a slide release on each side of the frame, plus a decocker that is located on the rear of the gun, just push it down and the hammer safety falls forward.  The P30 also has a true picatinny rail for lights and/or lasers.  This gun is crazy accurate and light on the recoil, which allows for fast follow-up shots.  The trigger is broken in and the pull weight has been slightly reduced due to use, but honestly that is a good thing... the DA pull was about 10-11 lbs, now it is probably 8-9 lbs and very smooth.  The single action is probably lighter too, but its breaking point is so awesome that it is hard to tell the trigger pull is better.  I would say the SA pull is probably still around 4-5 lbs, and breaks crisp.  There is some play before that point, but once it is there, it is AWESOME!!! The gun comes with TWO 15 round magazines, the original box, factory spent casing, manual, HK lock, and all side panels and back straps.  The only thing to note is that this HK has the ""glow in the dark"" sights, these are (in my opinion) better than standard dot sights, but obviously not as good as true night sights.  The only true reason I am even getting rid of this handgun is because I am now using 45acp handguns only and dont use this at all anymore.  If I dont have a practical use for it, then I want to find someone that will truly enjoy it as much as I have.  Requirements for purchase; FTF purchase within an hour away from Clarksville/Jeffersonville area (I may make exceptions), must show that you have Indiana ID and gun permit, have no felonies, and be willing to sign ""bill of sale"".  If you have any other questions just contact me through here and we can work something out. Not really interested in too many things to trade (I would rather sell the handgun), but willing to hear similar quality trade offers (Sigs, 1911s with light rails, anything 45acp), but if anything a high end AK74 in 5.45x39 (slr 105, etc) +/- extra depending on quality and condition would be awesome."
