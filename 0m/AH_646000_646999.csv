 It’s circa the mid 1990’s before Andy started building the super high $$$ gold inlay, mother of pearl and such exotic knives he’s known for now. This was a knife a poor man could own. It was either $400.00 or $450.00 new, I don’t remember now. I carried it a dozen times or so, then back in it’s case. The clip is scratched and the knife has very very minute scratches on it. The detail/engraving work is still outstanding, even being an early model. The case is original and what it came in. Blade, mint, never used it, never sharpened it, don’t know how. I collect firearms, not knives.
   If someone buys it and isn’t happy with it, I would offer a full refund.
What’s it worth,,,,well, to me,,,,, it’s still worth $400.00. So, if it’s worth that to you, buy it. If you want to offer a folder or 2 on trade, I’ll look at that too.

If I can’t get my price, I’ll just keep it, it costs nothing to keep and takes up little room in the safe, right? Maybe it’s gone way up in value, maybe way down, I only know what it’s worth to me. Thanks !"

It is a PSL. (Romak III) that has been reworked into a 16 inch barreled carbine. It was manufactured by waffen works out of TN. Below is a description of the rifle when it was available on atlantic firearms.

"" The AK-54Rrifles are built upon category 1 Romanian PSL parts kits, using a special reciever that allows for the use of regular AKM type buttstocks and pistol grips. They also feature a correct, and fully functional scope mount installed on the left side of the reciever. The barrel is shortened to 16.5 inches and is re-profiled, allowing the gas block and handgaurd retainer to be moved rearward, so that standard AKM gas pistons and handgaurds can be used.""

Basically they built an AKM in 7.62x54R. This rifle is no longer produced as it seems the import of the parts kits has slowed. I have seen these rifles sell for 1500+, with only one mag and no bayonett. I am offering mine up for 1200 with 6 mags, and a romanian bayonett to go with it, for more close encounters! These are a blast to shoot, and always turn heads. I am simply trying to consolidate my calibers. With that said, not in super hurry to sell. If the right offer comes along, I'll let her go. Have a nice day.

A super clean example of (arguably) the best fighting handgun ever made!
I bought this as a factory/armory rebuild, and have only put about 200 rounds through it to sight in after installing the Trijicon NS.

NOW, for the fun part:

IF you buy the gun as listed above, I will offer you two Glock FML mags- a  17 rnd and 33 rnd as pictured, for an additional $50. Bargain price, these mags have seen little to no use. At least a $60 value!


AND, if you buy the gun and mags as listed above, I will offer an Insight M6 Tactical Illuminator with laser, for an additional $150! This unit has only lived in my safe, never been out of the house. Normal retail for these units is over $200!

(Note: I can only find one M6 box, so one will be without packaging, but have the adjustment wrench and two fresh CR123 batteries. First come, first serve!) 


BUT WAIT THERE’S MORE! ;) 

Buy the gun with the additional mags and M6 as listed, and I will be willing to throw in 2 boxes (50 rnds each, 100rnds total) of Winchester Ranger LE 9mm Bonded ammunition, for only another $50! Retail per box is at least $35 if you can find it, so this is a substantial savings on a hard to find product! Perhaps the best 9mm defensive ammo made! 


So, gun (s/n HZKxxx ) only (case, 2 17rnd mags) - $450 cash, FTF.
Whole enchilada- extra mags, M6, and 100 rounds of LE ammo- $700, cash only, FTF.

Just search Armslist, gunbroker, or buds and you can get more of an idea. 

It's a Rock River Arms LAR-8 (.308), in Mid-length (16"") barrel A4 configuration which has a flat top, fwd site base gas block with sling attachment, Hogue grip, 6 position stock. Comes with 3-20round mags and uses the FAL surplus mags which are inexpensive online and at gun shows. The 308 gives you the power and size to hunt large game and gives you a lot more range due to the projectile mass as compared to .223 while also having the ability to be a close combat semi-auto weapon. Also gives you way more muzzle velocity and several feet less bullet drop than the 7.62x39 past 250 yards.

The scope is a Leapers 1x4 combat scope with illuminated red/green reticle on a low profile base which has long eye relief. With a 1x4 you can crank it down and use it like a close combat red dot or bump it up to 4x to take 300 yard shots. The mounts are weaver quick release. The sling is a heavy padded combat sling that adjusts and has neoprene sleeves on the steel buckles so it doesnt make noise or scratch the finish. 200 rounds of federal, 40 rounds of winchester core lock. The nylon bag is padded with a sling to carry on your back with mag pouches in the front. 

I'd like to get $1100 for the rifle and 3 mags.
If you'd want the ammo I'll sell it below what I paid. 
For the scope, bag, sling, mounts, etc it's negotiable

Trades Im interested in would be a 300 aac blackout AR or 7.62x39 AR in either rifle or pistol."

For sale is my Ruger MkIII. It is a Talo distributor exclusive 4.5"" target model with Hunter barrel fluting, fiber optic front sight, adjustable notch rear sight, and deluxe Altamont target grips. The model number is MKIII45H-TA. See the specs here - shttp://www.ruger.com/products/markIIIDE/specSheets/10134.html

I had the hammer and sear polished by a local gunsmith for a nice crisp and repeatable action. I also installed a Sam Lam bushing that eliminated the magazine disconnect.

This has been my primary target pistol and does show some wear and minor marks on the receiver/barrel assy from the picatinny rail, but is still in excellent working order and overall good aesthetic condition. It comes with the original case, paperwork, factory spent casing, picatinny rail, extra light pipes for the front sight, and two 10-round factory magazines.

Please send me a contact phone number if you are interested and I will call you directly. I do not like to waste too much time going back and forth over email.

This revolver was made when Taurus produced licensed copies of older model Smith and Wesson revolvers and has one of the best triggers I've ever used outside of a Smith or Colt. In the time I've owned it I've put about 300 rounds through it without one failure to fire or other malfunction. It does show some holster and carry wear and there is a spot on the right side of the frame where a Brazilian police placard was placed and subsequently removed. While there is some wear, there is not one spot of rust anywhere on this VERY reliable revolver and with the Taurus life-time warranty (confirmed on the phone by Taurus before I purchased the pistol) you can't beat the price.

A few scuffs on the slide which won't even show up in the photos - internals are clean and immaculate. This pistol has been carried much more than it's been fired. I'd estimate I've only put about 250 rounds through it in three years. The date code is NWN*** which makes it a 2009 manufactured pistol. I'm not interested in shipping the pistol anywhere and I am not interested in any trades. I'm asking $470 cash and will need to see a valid MN drivers license and valid current MN permit to carry.

TEM DESCRIPTION:

Original Old West Single-Action Look, Size and Feel. Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger® Vaquero® has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority. It is often referred to as ""the gun that won the New West"" because of its widespread popularity among single-action shooters and cowboy action competitors.

The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk®, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800's.

This is a brand new never fired in box with matching serial on rifle and box.  Most of these you will see anywhere are used and the price I am asking is barely over the average used price and less than what many are asking.  I know of 4 that recently sold on here for $900 to $1100. 

Brand new with manufacture's warranty. This comes with a bayonet lug and flash hider. Also included are Two (2) G3 alloy magazines, 20 round capacity and trigger lock.

This rifle was made with the highly desirable stamped steel receiver (not the cast receiver, which can break). These are getting harder to find as this comes from the last manufacturing run. Get yours now before the inevitable price increase.

I look at the gun shows every time for these and used/new have ranged in price from $850 to $1300.  I am asking $900.  At the last Freeman show I went to I saw four total.  One dealer had two one new one used the new one was $1100 and the used one was $900 and in my oppinion looked awful.  I found a second dealer with a new one that looked pristine and was $1300 which was excessive in my oppinion,  Finally I found a gentleman walking around asking $850 for his used rifle that looked pretty beat up to me.



These are easy to modify and a blast to shoot.  I absolutely love my tricked out cetme with quad rail bipod foregrip collapsible stock which was very inespensive to do and still love shooting my standard one with iron sites just as much.



If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask.  I am willing to consider trades if the offer is right.  What interests me most is, Sig P238, Springfield XDS, Springfield XD 357, Springfield XD Mags, Umarex H&K 416 Pistol, Kel-tec KSG.  I have other interests but these are at the top.  For the most part I am not interested in 1911s, just not my thing.

Shoot me offers. This gun needs paint/coatings. The finish is worn and there is a little bit of rust pitting on the receiver. However, the function of this gun is perfect. It has never failed, never had an issue, fired about 500 rounds through it. Don't know how many rounds have gone through it in total. It is 922r compliant (a lot of them you find like this are NOT compliant). I am only seeing if I can get rid of it, not needing to and if I don't, I don't care. Do NOT low ball me. Standard MAK-90's run for $550 (poor original condition) to well over $1000. I am asking $900 obo. Trades are really what I am interested in though. Trades plus cash work just as well. 

Comes with 7 mags, few extra parts, Bushnell red dot and as many original parts as I could salvage. Contact with questions. Trade value must be $1000 plus. Your P95 is not WORTH the $350 you gave for it brand new a year ago now that it has 500 rounds through it. Your AR with 2000 rounds is NOT worth the $1000 you dropped on it two months ago before your course, however, if you have the right AR (i.e. good quality to include DPMS, Spikes, BCM, etc) then we can trade straight across or I may be able to sweeten the deal for you. If you have an optic, don't expect me to count it as retail, I won't. I'll let you keep it for more than about 30% of original cost because I can get them cheap brand new, no offense intended.
