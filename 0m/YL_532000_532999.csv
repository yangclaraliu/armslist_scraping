I have a large quanty of 1950's Polish ammo in the 1260 Round Tins. What's nice about the Polish ammo is that it has a Steel FMJ that make it almost like an Armor pericing round.  Most public target ranges will not let you shoot it, because it causes so much damage to there range.  The Polish ammo is hard core deep penetrating round, and it's sure fire, I've never had a bad round.  If you want to trade stright up, round for round, Polish for new production 7.62x25 ammo.  I'll trade any amount you want.  I'm not a dealer, I bought it to shoot it, and I'm shooting up more every day.  But I just target shoot, and don't care about how good it penetrats.  If you like the Polish ammo and want to trade some new production ammo for it, let's do it.  This Polish stuff is almost becoming a collectible.  I almost hate to shoot it as a normal target round.  By the way the new production ammo uses a thin copper jacket, so it does not penatrate like the thick steel jacket on the Polish ammo.  Thanks, Mike"

This rifle is brand new in box and comes with a harris bipod. The USO scope and rings have been sold and are no longer available.

Carved from years of hard-earned insight, the Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. Designed to adapt to a user’s every need, this revolutionary precision rifle offers long-range performance that others can only dream of.

Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it’s not a descendant of anything. This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting.

Thanks to its modular layout, this rifle can be adapted to fit each user’s exact needs. Its straight-line design, running from the muzzle to the shooter’s shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip. This allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a fresh round into the chamber as the bolt silently glides through a polymer guide. 

The Model 98B rifle’s aluminum upper receiver boasts an 18-inch M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions. 

This impressive long-range weapon isn’t all work. Equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod, it’s also a pleasure to shoot. From its highly efficient muzzle brake to its shooter-adaptable design and unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action.

Sig Sauer P238 – 50 rounds thru it. Bought new in 06-12. Box is marked manufactured 04-12. 
It is 2 toned. Comes with Sig hard case, (1) 7rnd factory clip, Factory Sig Laser (not attached), has night sites and factory finger groove grips. 

What I want:

Not interested in revolvers at this time but:
May even consider a North American Arms in 22mag caliber as part of the trade. 

I value my Sig trade at 600.00 as stated above. Options (extra’s) are available to add on my side if necessary to make a deal.
Options include up to (5) more factory 7rnd magazines, a Woolfe right hand IWB leather holster and a factory wallet holster.

You are looking at a gently used DPMS Model A-15 AR-15 rifle. This rifle was bought brand new and has only had one owner. I have put around 400 rounds through her with no problems or malfunctions to report. I have put a lot of time and effort to fine tune this weapon system to what exactly I wanted it to do and have all the things I've ever wanted. So to make a long story short this is not your ordinary stock rifle!

The features of this rifle are as follows; it shoots the 5.56 NATO round along with .223 remington. I have added a Magpul ACS stock in FDE(SOPMOD stock style), Magpul MOE pistol grip in FDE, Magpul MBUS front and rear sights in FDE, Magpul ASAP sling adaptor, Magpul MS2 one point sling(can also transition to two point if you add another sling adaptor to the rail), Promag tactical latch installed on the stock DPMS charging handle that was included with the rifle, Knights Armament RAS quad rail hand guard(the same thing used by our brave men and women overseas(God bless our troops!) Laserlyte K-15 Laser sighting system in tan, Eotech 512 A65(manufactured in 01/2012 and in like new condition. The rifle also comes with 3 PMAG magazines.

The special offer with this rifle is the possibility of also getting my tan Condor tactical soft case that i have been carrying this rifle in. It offers a snug fit for the rifle with two straps to strap down the rifle. The second layer of the case contains two padded compartments secured by velcro for storing accessories, tools, handguns(I put my government model 5"" barrel Kimber 1911 in one of the pouches for range days) etc. on the outside of the second compartment is molle and three already attached pouches for carrying more accessories and magazines. Its a pretty nice soft case and worth over 100$ and does its job! For the right price I'll part with it 


The last topic to discuss is that you may contact via e-mail through this site or for a much faster experience you can contact my cell at REDACTED.

P.S. serious offers only, no lowballers. I do not NEED to sell this set up I just want to start up a new project.

PRICE IS SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION. So don't be afraid to offer, the worst I can say is no."

Not only do they allow the shooter to stay on target at all times, but lets the intruder know he won't be missed.  In person transaction only.

I am open to trades (Cash may be needed by either party to level out the deal) for the following weapons and items:

AR-15 (Rock River or DPMS only, 6.5mm lower with 5.56mm upper preferred)
H&K P2000SK
H&K P30
SPAS 12-S Shotgun (Authentic only, no reproductions or replicas)
Browning Citori 20 Gauge
Browning BSS 28 Gauge

1300$ is a steal for this lil pistol

this lil pistol is 100% reliable with steel cased ammo i have about 1000 rounds through it with no ftf fte this is boringly reliable

i have received a lot of emails stating that the buffer tube on there is illegal it is not......it has the holes for the stock filled and welded and the endcap is epoxied on there.....there would be no possible way to attach a stock on this buffer tube making it perfectly legal......


also would like to state that while this is listed in rifles it is a pistol i posted it in this section because someone looking for a rifle is much more likely to pick this up then a guy looking for a ccw
only trades would be for a glock 19 (3rd gen only) a suzuki drz 400 or a 85-92 vw golf"

Any hunter, target shooter or gun enthusiast who has lived in Denver knows that the capital city of one of the most gun/hunter friendly states provides few opportunities to maintain proficiency as a hunter or marksman. While there is a selection of shooting ranges in the city, albeit dwindling, many are considered to be over-priced, un-welcoming, or unsuitable for certain types of shooting (3-gun, quick draw, long range, etc.). The easiest alternative is to find private land with owners consent. However, few city-dwellers have easy contact with farmers and ranchers, and few farmers and ranchers are overly eager to have gun-toting city dwellers traipse about their land. That leaves public land, owned by the Department of Wildlife, the Forestry Department, or the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). One look at a government map of the state of Colorado shows an abundant supply of free-to-shoot land... on the western slope. Us Front-Rangers are mainly limited to Pawnee National Grasslands in the northeast, and Comanche in the south. I have personally been to both Pawnee and Comanche, and can testify that while they are both no-frills nothing-fancy areas to shoot, they are perfect for any activity you can think of, within the confines of the law, obviously. The only draw-back to Pawnee for Denver shooters is the drive. From Exit 1-25 exit 200, the shooting area I have visited was just around 90 miles away, and that was the well known ""busy"" area. There are more remote areas with longer distances to backdrops for distance shooters, but those may be another 20 miles away. For a solo outing to blow off some rounds or to dial in a rifle, a 160-200 mile round trip drive is less than ideal. Which made me ask; has anyone seen, heard of, or thought about a Denver Metro Shooting Club? I am not talking about a gun club with fees or weird initiations or mandatory meetings, I am think about something more relaxed and useful.
 The idea I have would be to make a Facebook page where people could simply post where they are going to shoot, when, for how long, and how many people they could take. Also, they could list what they might expect to help out with gas, as well as rules they would want to abide by. 
An example would be;

1 shooter going to Pawnee Sunday, August 26th. Departing Denver at 0930, will return home 1700. Have room for 3 more shooters. Would like $10 per passenger for fuel, or a box of 12ga or 5.56. No drinking, no littering.

I understand many are wary of strangers, but have to say everyone I have met on Armslist has been really cool so far. I've sold magazines to military veterans and purchased sights and rifles from active and retired law enforcement. I think that if we are honest about what the group could be, efficient car-pooling and friendly shooting with responsible individuals, this could be a success. It could also be a great way for hunters to network and make new hunting friends. Small-gamers could gain access to new prairie dog and rabbit land, and any friends of farmers can help their farmer friends out with a plethora of new responsible shooters. There will be no tolerance for the shooters that spend all afternoon drinking and shooting and leave hundreds of shotgun shells and dozens of beer cans littered about giving a bad name to shooters everywhere.

If something similar to what I have described already exists, I would love to know about it. Please feel free to email me at docneuey@gmail.com and let me know what kind of shooting you would like to do, and maybe a short paragraph including your shooting experience. If there is a strong enough response, I will take the next step in making this real.

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this. I would appreciate any feedback you may have.

It has a Nightforce 20moa base, with a SS 16X42 tactical mil-dot scope with caps. This rifle also has a Badger tactical bolt knob, Versa-pod dowl mount and Versa-pod bipod. The rifle sits in a very comfortable Manners T-4 OD green stock with an adj. cheek weld. This stock also has the famed Manners all aluminum Mini-chasis system which allows perfect drop in rifle capability without the need to glass bed the rifle, with the same accuracy benefits. This stock is much better than the McMillan stocks in my opinion as I had a McMillan A-4 on this rifle and switched it for this stock, which is a more rigid stock with better fit and finish. I also have the Badger M-5 bottom metal with AI detachable 5rd mag that was factory installed with the mini-chasis. I am looking to trade this rifle for an LWRC piston AR-15 or a Noveske, or Knights armament SR-15 rather than sell outright. I am not inerested in any other trades at this time. Thanks"

Springfield Armory made a .45cal 1911 Officers Model called the ""Compact"". These were either steel (35 oz) or aluminium (24 oz) and were originally 6 round magazines (6+1).

They do offer them in their custom catalog and the price starts at $800.00

Without the magazine, you can use it as a single-shot rifle, the magazine holds seven (7) rounds. The rifle has a bull barrel with recessed muzzle; the trigger is not adjustable, the front sight is fixed, and the rear sight is a micro-adjustable peepsight Mossberg S100, Mossberg S133, or Lyman 57 MS (and there may be other sights out there). The barrel is ""lead-lapped"" which is a process (as explained to me) that fills in the micro-cracks in the metal producing a very smooth surface with very little variance or imperfections.
