Here is what Chiappa says about the rifle.

The M1 carbine is a lightweight, easy to use semi-automatic carbine that became astandard ﬁrearm for the U.S. military during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and was produced in several variants. It was widely used by U.S. and foreign military, paramilitary and police forces, and has also been a popular civilian ﬁrearm. A total of over 6.5 million M1 carbines of various models were manufactured, making it the most produced small arm for the American military during World War II. Despite being designed by Winchester, the great majority of these were made by other companies : the largest producer was the Inland division of General Motors, but many others were made by contractors as diverse as IBM, the Underwood Typewriter Company, and the Rock-Ola jukebox company. The Chiappa Firearms’ M1-22 is a rimﬁre replica of the M1 carbine, featuring a blowback system and an adjustable rear sight, which can be removed to leave guides free for optics mount. The barrel and bolt are made of solid steel, the trigger guard, stock and magazine of polymer. The 10 round magazine has a straight proﬁle like the original. The stock is interchangeable with the original; a wooden stock version and a black synthetic stock version are available."

If you enjoy the freedom of firearms ownership and the responsibility that goes along with it, this applies to you. 
I attended the gun show in Carter Lake recently and was incredibly disturbed to see people walking around drinking beer and other alcoholic beverages. While no harm came of the situation, don't you (firearms owners) think that we are already fighting an uphill battle against mainstream perception? I, personally, think that we should be doing everything possible not to draw any negative attention to ourselves and to firearms in general. If the media were to get ahold of pictures of people at a gun show drinking beer, what on earth do you think they would report?!?!  I would never want to be portrayed as anything other than responsible when it comes to firearms ownership. We as a group need to wake up and evaluate how we are viewed by non-firearms enthusiasts. We should be ever wary of the image we present. In this day and age, we need to constantly politic for our right to the 2nd amendment. Perception is everything when it comes to firearms and the people that don't like them, and I guarantee you that we will be forced to battle for our freedoms even harder if we are portrayed as beer drinking fools walking around trying to buy up our list of goods for a coming apocalypse. 
I value my right to own firearms as one of the most important freedoms I have in our country! Please join me in doing everything possible not to allow ourselves to look like idiots!"

Be advised this is a ""Saturday Night Special"" pistol. I inhereited this thing from a family member and frankly, in my opinion this is nothing but pot metal junk. Do not expect alot from this thing. But if someone wants a pocket pistol to shoot at point blank range, this is as cheap as it gets but still goes Bang.

A 3x9 scope(not an expensive one, but a good, sturdy one)
An interchangeable barrel in .222 Remington (what the .223 was based on. A sum up of it is it shoots a bit further, and flatter than the .223, but it doesn't tumble on impact.)
2 .222 five round mags.
Seven boxes of .222 ammo.
And a laser bore sight for .223.

It also fires milsurp 5.56 quite well, and prefers the 55gr rounds as opposed to heavier.

All you need for swapping the barrels is a vice and a wrench, and somewhere around 15 minutes work to realign. Not hard, but not an on the fly thing.

A great, accurate, versatile rifle.
Has a few scratches from hunting, but has been cleaned and cared for well.

I have some great pictures, but they are too large for the site. Please email with offer if you request pictures, just to raise my moral a bit. I understand that nothing is final before you see what it is. And I like pictures, too.

Note: I have no need to sell this, so unless you are local, and willing to pay much more than its worth, I will only consider trades."

Might want to buy ahead of the much-discussed assault weapon ban, because if it goes into effect as written this version of the venerable SIG556 will no longer be available!

I have only fired around 100 rounds through this rifle since I bought it new. This rifle features a collapsible folding stock, a flip-up rear sight and I have also installed the Sig Sauer Red-Dot sight, which co-witnesses perfectly with the fixed sights.  I have also installed a Grip-Pod fore-grip that converts to a bi-pod with the push of a button.  

Everything you see in the photos goes with the rifle, including the SIG hard case, lock, and owner’s manual.

You can’t find any SIG556s on the shelves right now, and if the ban passes there may not be any more available. Get it while you still can!

Let me know if you have any questions. CASH only, not interested in any trades – FTF with valid ODL.

SIG556® ER features a 16” military grade cold hammer forged barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”. The flash suppressor uses a standard .5 x 28 TPI thread pattern, ensuring compatibility with after-market accessories. The forearm housing the gas operating system is a vented non-slip polymer featuring the SIG TriRail design with three integrated Picatinny rails for mounting accessories. The optional flip up front combat sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. The Picatinny rail equipped receiver is made of high strength steel with a durable wear-resistant Nitron® finish. The Picatinny rail features an optional flip up rear sight that works in concert with the optional front combat sight, providing iron sight performance and a back up sight option for optics. The trigger housing is machined from an aircraft grade aluminum alloy forging with a hard-coat anodized finish designed to survive extreme conditions. The rifle comes equipped with a smooth two-stage trigger, ambidextrous safety and is designed to accept standard AR magazines. A 30-round magazine is supplied with each rifle. The collapsible buttstock features a rubber butt pad, multiple sling attachment points, and a waterproof battery compartment.

This is a some-what rare shotgun. I have done some research and found that only 5000 of these were made from 1985 through 1988. The model 120 was originally produced for military and police applications.  These shotguns were a cheaper, ""no-frills"" version of the model 1300 (and parts are interchangeable between the two), but their rarity increased the value to most collectors.

I bought the gun for 308.00 out the door and the ammo is worth about 12.00 and the holster around 11.00 so this is definitely a deal and I am absolutely firm on the price so don't waste my time if your not willing to pay 300.0 and meet in Tacoma.

I am only looking to sale because I found a very rare 9mm that I am wanting to buy and need the cash to do so.

Lots of good reviews and bad out there on this gun, my opinion is that it is identical to a Kel-Tec P11 if not better made. It certainly looks and feels nicer but again I haven't shot the gun so I don't know how it handles.

I have an Adams Arms AR in .556/.223. The metal on these rifles receive a Melonite treatment similar to that on a Glock or Springfield XD and it looks and feels nicer than the DPMS that I also have. It's a flat top with a Magpul flip up rear sight, Magpul enlarged/rounded trigger area, Magpul buttstock, Magpul grip, and Magpul hand guards. It's really nice but we haven't had a chance to shoot it and with the way things are right now I thought I'd see if someone else would want it.

This is not a standard SKS that takes stripper clips or duck bill SKS mags. This was converted by the Chinese in the early 90's to except AK-47 magazines. The mag release is identical to the AK. They originally came with a thumbhole wood stock but the previous owner has installed this after market polymer stock (very sturdy). This is a good price on these rifles. This is what they were going for before the panic. I have seen quite a few standard SKS rifles on here for quite alot more. This rifle is in excellent condition.

Here are the details:

1. 1919 Ishapora Lee Enfield No.1 MKIII Shtle.  This rifle is FULLY MATCHING, every single part.  The only negative part of it is the stock, it's in rougher shape, but I never wanted to refinish due to it being a full matching rifle.  I have 160 rounds of mil-surp .303 ammo to go with it.  All still in original unopened boxes.
2. 1937 Turkish Mauser based on the German Gewehr 98.  Very good condition and includes 20 rounds of new manufacture ammunition.  The action is excellent on this rifle, you can beat the German Mauser action.  No issues to speak of.
3. 1930's S&W breaktop ""lemonsqueezer"" 5 shot revolver chambered in .32s&w.  Good condition.  This is a bit more rare for these pistols, it is the 3"" BLUED bbl.  Most were nickel.  Serial number dates it to the 1930's.  I have 50 rounds of new manufacture ammo to go with it.  No issues to speak of with this revolver.

Not sure what to ask for these since I'm trying to make them quick sales.  I'd like to see $350 - $400 for the Enfield (the ammo is worth quite a bit right now).  The Mauser I'd ask $150.  The S&W I'd like to see $250.  If someone can get them today/this weekend, I'll do $700 for all OBO.  I think that's a heck of a deal for 2 rifles, a revolver and almost 250 rounds of ammo.

Not interested in trades at this time, trying to get cash for another purchase ASAP.

Thanks all, please email me with any questions or offers and I'll respond right away.  Emails come right to my phone."

It is also supposed to eliminate copper fouling. According to Hodgdon's load data, it produces among the most impressive velocities for .223/5.56 and .308/7.62. From Hodgdon's website:
""Introduced in January 2012, this versatile spherical rifle propellant incorporates in its formula CFE, Copper Fouling Eraser. This ingredient, originally used in military propellant, greatly deters copper fouling. It contributes to longer periods of top accuracy with less barrel cleaning time. Being a spherical powder, metering is superbly accurate. CFE 223 yields top velocities in many cartridges such as the 204 Ruger, 223 Remington/5.56mm NATO, 22-250 Remington and the 308 Winchester/7.62mm NATO, plus many, many more. Match, Varmint and AR shooters will love this one!""

I bought this powder a while ago on a whim, and then realized it burns too slow for my M1A, which is much more picky than AR pattern rifles. It is brand new and unopened. I would sell for $20 or trade for another powder or reloading stuff. Just send me an offer. Cash price is firm."

I have vintage ""glass rods"" this is what I learned to fly fish on; also many are graphite or composite. I have a some inexpensive reels and can match a reel to a rod if you like. These are great fun for pond fishing for bream or bass. I have a few heavier rods that are good for fly fishing in the surf, just be sure to wash your gear down really good after each use. You can make an appointment to come see them most any time. If you are new to fly fishing I will be more than glad to give you a tutorial. I am in Awendaw.

Like I said, looking for a 44 Mag or possibly a 41 Mag revolver.  I prefer 44 Mag over the 41.  Would rather have double action over single action unless its the Hunter Model. The only Taurus 44 Mag I will consider is the Raging Bull.  I can add cash depending on your offer. Cash offers will be ignored for now unless I find a revolver I want at a retailer. Face to face No shipping.  PTP/PTC required. I show you mine, I see yours. You must be willing to meet me half way between you and me and would like to keep it with 45 minuets of Mankato.

When you reply please send pics of your trade.  I would request them anyway, so it will speed the process up if they were included.  I will add pics here when I get home from work or will reply via email from my phone with pics. Also include if you have any extras (i.e. brass, ammo, reloading components etc.)...

It is almost impossible to find the 15rd or 17rd magazines now, and if you do they are insanely priced.

Here is a link to see what just the 10rd mags are being sold for right now:

You can search Ebay for other auctions for 5906 mags and see that they are all going for over 50 each for the 10rd. All of the mags in this sale are the 15rd and 17rd.......

 The AK has been completely cerakoted in graphic black and the wood furniture has been refinished in Russian Red. It will come with 2 sets of furniture, one set is original the other set is Bulgarian with a pistol grip.
 I am interested in trading for a Government sized 1911, but will consider all offers. I like a wide variety of guns and calibers, I also reload 9mm, 45 acp, and 357 sig so a combination of weapons and reloading supplies will be looked at closely. I could use a good spotting scope if you have one you would like to pair with something else to make it a more appealing offer. I would also be willing to trade for a Walther PPK/S All German or Sig P230SL all German pistol plus cash.

 I do not need to get rid of this gun so if the right deal does not come along I will keep this in the safe, I am wanting to trade it as I am really wanting a 1911. I would also consider a pistol in 10 mm like a S&W or Colt, I'm not to fond of Glock 10mm pistols.
 Trade should be in the Hampton Roads area, FTF, with 2 forms of ID and we will do a bill of sale. So no felons. Will consider a cash price as well.
