The 9mm is a good round for self defense and is a cheaper round to buy than many others.

There have been 250 rounds through the rifle total and it is in perfect condition well cleaned and taken care of after each outing. It has been a fantastic hunting and plinking gun, but its time to move on to another project. The rifle comes standard with the HS Precision stock which are some of the best in the world. It has a 20 Inch Fluted Bull Barrel, I replaced the trigger with a Rifle Basics tuned to a nice crisp 2.5 lbs pull which adjustable if thats a little too light for you. It has a Trijicon 5x20x50 Scope up top it has a Burris 20 MOA mount and Burris XTR rings. The rifle is currently zeroed at 100 Yds. As you can see it has a Harris rotating pod, and a Harris Bench Rest bi-pod attached right now I'll also throw in the tall version bi-pod you see which is also a Harris, it also has a monopod on the back that just attaches to the sling stud. Everything you need to make the perfect rifle has already been done its good to go right off. This rifle is golden 700 yds and in but with the right round 1000 yds is possible. I'l also toss in 60 rounds of Federal Sierra Match King, and 20 Hornady TAP and a .308 bore snake. IF you could find this rifle will all the parts and smithing you would pay around 2800 your paying 1100 less for a rifle already broken in and sighted in.

I will sell them a few bucks less than Cheaper Than Dirt sells them. If I trade them, I will value them at what Cheaper Than Dirt sells them at.

I have then at my storage unit so I don't have info on the grain of the Handgun Ammo. All the ammo listed here is 100% new BUT aprox. 30 rounds of 40 S&W were in the Magazines for my handgun.  

All the Handgun rounds are designated for personal Protection.
-9mm Luger. 2 boxes of 50. Federal Classic JHP
-40 S&W. 2 boxes of 50. One box is Winchester Ranger, the other is Winchester (I can't remember the exact label but its a white box.)

Rifle Rounds:
5.56 NATO. Russian made, 62gr SP. 350+ rounds. 200 are loose in a ""bulk storage box"" the rest are in the manufacturer packaging. $225.00 FIRM cash or trade.
17HMR. Hornady. I used some of the rounds but the box had 50, now there are aprox. 30rnds. I'll let them go cheap.

I am in Lakeland and I'm willing to meet somewhere withing a 45 minute drive. I have 90% silver US coinage also I would consider using towards a gun.

This is a very early saiga import with the conversion done by B-West. They were sent out by B-West then had to go back as BW Forgot to install bullet guides (some useless trivia) for the geAKs.
Anyway compared to today's Arsenal SGL-31 the differences are:

B-West conversion is on the early smooth sided receivers, Flash Hider is permanently attached and I replaced the plastic with wood furniture. Outside of the wood furniture, it has been untouched parts or accessory wise since purchased new.
ALL matching numbers EXCEPT for the receiver cover, which is a smooth side one that early saigas came with

The SGL-31 is running $850 + transfer + shipping, range

This rifle like my arsenals do not have any serial numbers other than what is on the trunnion. 

From the ""93"" stamp and early 100 serial number I would have to say this was part of the original B-west imports. For those who don't know b-west were THE first to start importing the AK-47.

Also have another AK for sale as well if you click on the ""listings by this user"" tab on this page

Specifically one that's of the older body style.  I'm aware of the sale value of this bike, and am willing to set someone up with guns and ammunition for an equivalent value. 

No, I don't mean junk guns or weird caliber ammunition.  

I absolutely will not play games with gun or bike value, an honest person will appreciate this.  

If you're one of those underground illegal dealers (people that buy and sell guns constantly for a profit without benefit of an FFL) looking to score a profit, then we aren't going to see eye to eye.  I've dealt with too many people of that kind and wont do so again.  Yes, I've been around long enough to know who you are.

Yeah, I now, my comments may get me flagged by people who have nothing better to do - again, you know who you are.  But this is an honest offer for trade, my guns, your bike.

I'll keep this ad up til I find a trade, I specifically want a off-road and highway capable bike, NOT a converted dirt bike.  My guns live in a safe and I'll expect the bike to have lived a similar existence.  Prior to finalizing any trade, a colorado ID will have to be presented or a Colorado CCW.  The trade will take place upon issuance of title at the local DMV, where we'll both be present. To protect both of us.  

I can travel a reasonable distance to make this happen, but if it's LONG distance there need to be some pictures.  

Tell me what you hope for, and I'll tell you if I we can make a trade!

Thanks!"

It is a no excuses, get the job done, seriously bad a** rifle that also has everything to convert it back to factory if you want and all factory pieces are in excellent condition. It is a Chinese Norinco SKS. Comes with pro mag brand 30 rd mag & factory 10rd mag, muzzle brake, UTG shell deflector, UTG receiver cover with scope mounts and a pronghorn scope, a second Norinco brand scope mount for having 2 different scopes in mounts zeroed and ready to go (just 2 screws change them out), utg quad rail, tapco fusion system tactical stock (has the T-6 6 position stock with storage compartment), magpul angled foregrip and seperate rail mounted finger grip, led light, bipod, rail mount sling mount with new sling, multiple receivers including the numbers matching factory receiver, factory original stock with original cleaning kit and rod all in excellent condition, still mounted factory iron sights that can be seen under the scope and through the quad rail, recently replaced main spring, ammo, tools (including a 7.62x39 broken shell removal tool that has never been used that is currently in the pistol grip) and more. I have been debating on putting it on armslist to trade for another gun and some cash or multiple guns trade for awhile. Guess I'll see what happens. I dont have to (and kinda dont want to) sell it, I'm just seeing whats out there that i might want instead. I have only seen one sks on armslist that even came close to what mine is and he was asking 850. (and it didn't even have everything mine does) I was told by a trusted gunsmith that mine is worth around 950 with everything that mine comes with. It will hit 12 inch steel targets at 300 yds with the IRON SIGHTS and a good shooter. The scope puts it out even farther. Kept clean, oiled and rust preventative used. Still takes SKS mags but i have the manual that shows how to convert it to take AK mags. (comes with the rifle)      There is probabaly more that i am forgetting....its that complete!     900 firm is the cash price but would like to trade with cash

I also have a sweet Lorcin 25 auto subcompact with white night sights that glow bright green in the dark, green fiber optic front sight, 2 mags, Hogue rubberized grip sleeve, pocket holster and ammo (defensive, hp and fmj) i can put with the SKS for the right trade. It is very light and very small which makes it easy to conceal and carry. Just had it checked out today (9-21-12) by a gunsmith and mine shows no signs of potential problems that some of the Lorcins have had. Shoots great. Kept clean and oiled. Great gun.

For sale is a hard-to-find Modular AR platform from MGI Military.
For a little background, here is their site:
www.mgimilitary.com
This unit has a quick change barrel system, meaning you can change not only the length but also the calibers in mere seconds. Automatic headspacing is accomplished merely by rotating two locking levers. Genius!
This rifle also has a removable magwell, and comes with the standard AR magwell as well as the AK magwell. You can now run your AK mags through your AR, training with the same weapon and even utilizing the same push-button magazine release not found on the AK series.
Rifle comes with the bolt and firing pin for 223 and 7.62Ã39, as well as 16 in barrels in both 223 and 7.62Ã39. Added up, it means you are running two guns through one with the capability to expand even further.
MGI is still developing more magwells, but pistol conversion kits are available. Try finding any of these complete rifles on Gunbroker, ArmsList, etc and youâll be disappointed. Iâve been waiting for this one for 7 months, and finally got it on island. Situations have arisen, and I have not even taken it to the range once. My loss is your gain.
Asking price is $2,000. Willing to negotiate, but bear in mind these are all backordered and the craze is about to start. I will keep this ad up through Sunday and then take it down.
I have a new Pelican 1720 available as well that I will include for an additional $200. That is below their new price and already on island, so no wait time or shipping charges.
Open to trades, but please make them worthwhile. It never hurts to ask!

My package has high capacity 20 round magazines, no mag holder. 

this is some information from another listed about the rifle-
Pix #1 In the late 1960's Israel ordered an unknown quantity of Armalite AR-7 22lr cal semi auto survival rifles. They made the various modifications pictured here, provided a canvas roll bag. The set was then strapped to the ejection seat in their fighter aircraft. A few years ago less than 200 of them were imported into the U.S.

Pix #2, Among the Israeli modifications was to shorten the barrel to 13 inches. Before the importer could re-sell the guns he had to attach the 3 inch simulated muzzle break to bring it back out to a legal minimum 16"".

Pix #3, Nearly all the changes made to the gun were done with pre-existing parts. Note the grip is for an FAL. Forward sling swivel is for an L1A1. I'm not sure what the canvas sling was used on but it is original to the gun.

Pix #4, Close up of the barrel just ahead of the chamber. Note the serial numbered on the barrel not done on factory Armalites. Also the importer's stamp under The Armalite address.(not shown)

Pix #5, Barrel removed & stock collapsed. Package length would have been 13"" had the 3"" barrel extension not been added for legality. Note the front sight, it's for a K98 Mauser!(not shown)

 I have three- 20 round magazines for mine- Check out the price of 20 rd mags... I think you will be satisfied this is a better package. 
Also- I am a fan of spare parts- so I have a couple extra springs for the AR-7
I will offer my AR7- the 3 twenty round mags, and the two sets (4 total) action springs 

I am not desperate, I welcome offers, But please no dumb offers- for example some genius offered me $300.... I really don't need to talk to someone who is that ignorant of gun values. 

 I am just looking for a more modern rifle(s) or pistols.... I am happy to entertain all trades, the worst I can do is say no... I will add cash if your trade is worth more"

This is the complete tactical sks setup you've been looking for!!!!


This is a complete tactical SKS kit! ......I have the meanest, baddest tactical sks you will probably ever find. It is a no excuses, get the job done, seriously bad a** rifle that also has everything to convert it back to factory if you want and all factory pieces are in excellent condition. It is a Chinese Norinco SKS. Comes with pro mag brand 30 rd mag & factory 10rd mag, muzzle brake, UTG shell deflector, UTG receiver cover with scope mounts and a pronghorn scope, a second Norinco brand scope mount for having 2 different scopes in mounts zeroed and ready to go (just 2 screws change them out), a UTG quad rail that hides the gas tube and makes it look more like a ""black rifle"" (ar's, m4's etc.), tapco fusion system tactical stock (has the T-6 6 position stock with storage compartments in the pistol grip and buttstock), Magpul angled foregrip and seperate rail mounted finger grip, led light and rail mount, adjustable bipod, rail mount sling mount with new sling, multiple receivers including the numbers matching factory receiver, factory original stock with original cleaning kit and rod all in excellent condition, still mounted factory iron sights that can be seen under the scope and through the quad rail, recently replaced main spring, ammo, tools (including a 7.62x39 broken shell removal tool that has never been used that is currently in the pistol grip) and more. I have been debating on putting it on armslist to trade for another gun and some cash or multiple guns trade for awhile. Guess I'll see what happens. I dont have to (and kinda dont want to) sell it, I'm just seeing whats out there that i might want instead. I have only seen one sks on armslist that even came close to what mine is and he was asking 850. (and it didn't even have everything mine does) I was told by a trusted gunsmith that mine is worth around 950 with everything that mine comes with. It will hit 12 inch steel targets at 300 yds with the IRON SIGHTS and a good shooter. The scope puts it out even farther. Kept clean, oiled and rust preventative used. Still takes SKS mags but i have the manual that shows how to convert it to take AK mags. (comes with the rifle)      There is probabaly more that i am forgetting....its that complete!     900 firm is the cash price but would like to trade with cash

What i have is an original crash axe(duracoated to your liking) but instead of having the full sized handle I have shortened it to give the blade more forward weight for chopping through metal. Thats right our hawks can take the roof off cars, break chains and master locks too. I am asking 550 for the hawk or open to trades. This is the only one of its kind custom straight from  the shop. We are currently back ordered on the site so this is the quickest way to get one of our hawks in your hands. Plus they are re selling on ebay for 200 over retail. I also have a colt junior in 25 acp.

It is in excellant condition.  Great rifle for upcoming deer season. Cleaning jag and tool to take primer holder out is included as well.   Thanks for looking.

The G  trigger is fantastic and the gun is utterly reliable. The Tantal muzzle break is one of the best breaks out there and the recoil is more on par with a .22 then a military caliber rifle. Add to this the legendary reliability of the AK platform and you have the perfect SHTF,Zombie or just plain fun gun.

It has a MI rail handguard with a top designed to hold an Aimpoint micro (or clone like PA). The gun comes with 9 original AK 74 magazines (Russian and Bulgarian  made - NOT Tapco) with pouches. Of course, the original furniture is included in the deal.

For extra $200 you can also get an original wooden crate with 2200+ rounds of ammo  - that is less then 10c for a round. Some .22 rounds cost more.

The Remington Model 700 series is the all-time best selling line of bolt action sporting rifles in the world. They were an immediate hit when introduced in 1962 and have never looked back. The Model 700 has also become the favored action of many custom rifle builders.

The Model 700 action was designed for ease of manufacture, given the manufacturing technology of the early 1960's, and uses a round action machined from bar stock, a plunger ejector in the bolt face and a sort of circlip in the bolt face that snaps over the rim of a chambered cartridge to extract the fired brass. The bolt face is recessed to enclose the base of the cartridge, which is also surrounded by the chamber end of the barrel and the front receiver ring. The cartridge head is thus circled by three rings of steel, much as with the Weatherby Mark V action, and this fact was not overlooked by the Remington advertising department.

Traditionalists considered these cost cutting innovations ""cheap,"" but the customers responded in droves to the undeniable good looks of the Model 700 ADL and BDL rifles themselves. They were among the best looking hunting rifles ever introduced and the stock design handled recoil very well, which made them pleasant to shoot. The two position safety (back for ""safe"" and forward for ""fire"") at the rear of the action is easy to operate; it used to lock the bolt (to prevent inadvertent opening in the field) as well as the trigger, but the former feature has been eliminated. They were also hell for strong and very accurate. An excellent user-adjustable trigger with the exceptionally fast lock time of 3.0 milliseconds complemented the inherent accuracy of the new rifles.

Remington got a leg up on the market because in 1964 Winchester introduced a revised version of their famous Model 70 rifle--really a new action--also designed for easier manufacture, that pleased practically no one. The new Model 70 was actually a good action, but the stock design, barrel bedding, checkering, and so forth left a lot to be desired. Many previous Winchester customers turned to the sharp looking Model 700 from Remington.

The Model 700 has evolved with the market place and today it is available in a bewildering array of models. Some are pretty plain and some are bespoke rifles turned out to special order in Remington's Custom Gun Shop. Model 700 barreled actions are made from carbon or stainless steel, with matte or polished finishes, and stocked in solid walnut, laminated wood, and synthetic materials. They come in a variety of barrel lengths and contours and for a wide range of cartridges. The constant (at least for the centerfire rifles) is the Model 700 action itself, the heart of every Model 700 rifle.

I have been involved with Model 700 rifles since 1965 and I have lost track of all of the permutations over the years. In 2008 alone the Remington catalog lists some 21 variations of Model 700's, excluding Custom Shop offerings.

It is impossible to chronicle so many models in one article, so I will attempt to describe only a few of the best known and most interesting Model 700 variations. For 2008, the top of the Model 700 line is the CDL (blued barreled action and walnut stock) and CDL SF (stainless/fluted barreled action and walnut stock). CDL models come standard with a hinged magazine floorplate (the release button is inside the front of the trigger guard). The classic style, straight comb stocks are laser cut checkered in a generous pattern and supplied with studs for detachable sling swivels. Both the barreled action and the stock of all CDL models wears a non-glare satin finish. We have reviewed the 2008 Limited Edition version of the Model 700 CDL SF in .260 caliber, so for further details about this model I will simply refer you to the Product review Page.

The Model 700 BDL (which I translate as ""B-grade Deluxe"") was the flagship of the Model 700 line from its inception until the introduction of the CDL in 2005. BDL models come standard with a hinged magazine floorplate (the release button is inside the front of the trigger guard) or a detachable box magazine (""DM"" versions). Stocks are checkered and supplied with studs for detachable sling swivels. Left handed BDL's are available.

The traditional BDL comes with a genuine walnut Monte Carlo style stock which is cut checkered in an attractive skip-line point pattern that wraps around the fore-end. This stock is fitted with a black fore-end tip, pistol grip cap, and black butt plate or recoil pad (in magnum calibers), all set off by white line spacers. The barreled action receives Remington's polished blue finish. An adjustable open rear and hooded ramp front sight are standard. This is Remington's most attractive regular production rifle.

Over the years, the walnut stocked BDL has been available in more calibers than any other Model 700 variation. in 2005 the list included .17 Rem., .222 Rem., .223 Rem., .22-250 Rem., .243 Win., .25-06 Rem., .270 Win., 7mm-08 Rem., .280 Rem., 7mm Rem. Mag., 7mm Ultra Mag, .308 Win., .30-06 Spfd., .300 Win. Mag., .300 Ultra Mag, .338 Win. Mag., .338 Ultra Mag and .375 Ultra Mag, but by 2008 the list had been significently reduced in favor of the newer Model 700 CDL.

There is also a Synthetic Stainless BDL. This version features a matte black synthetic stock with a recoil pad and a satin (silver) stainless steel barreled action without sights. The BDL Synthetic Stainless is a handsome example of a rifle of its type. It is available in calibers .270 Win., 7mm Rem. SAUM, 7mm Rem. Mag., 7mm Ultra Mag, .30-06 Spfd., .300 Rem. SAUM, .300 Win. Mag., .300 Ultra Mag, .338 Win. Mag., .338 Ultra Mag, .375 H&H Mag. and .375 Ultra Mag.

Special long range Model 700's include the Sendero SF and Varmint rifles. The Sendero SF is an ultra-long range big game rifle that features a fluted, stainless steel, heavy barreled action in a special, un-checkered, aramid-fiber-reinforced stock with full length aluminum bedding blocks. Calibers are limited to the various 7mm and .300 Magnums, plus the .338 Ultra Mag.

The three Model 700 Varmint rifles are the 700 VS, a heavy barreled varmint rifle with a fiberglass composite stock; the 700 VLS, a heavy barrel varmint rifle in a laminated wood Monte Carlo style stock; and the 700 VS SF, with a heavy, fluted, stainless steel barreled action in a fiberglass composite stock. None of these stocks are checkered. Calibers include .220 Swift, .223 Rem., .22-250 Rem. and .308 Win. The latter, of course, is not a varmint caliber at all.


An oddity is the Ultimate Lightweight Model 700 Titanium. This features a titanium action mated to a 22"" lightweight stainless steel barrel, a fluted bolt, and a very plain, un-checkered, carbon-fiber composite stock. It weighs only 5 1/4 pounds in short action calibers .260 Rem., 7mm-08 Rem. and .308 Win. or 5 1/2 pounds in long action calibers .270 Win. and .30-06 Spfd. Maybe they should have named it the Ultimate Kick Model 700 Titanium!

One of the neatest Model 700's is the Mountain Rifle LSS. The Mountain Rifle LSS is a deluxe model that features a stainless steel barreled action with a slim profile 22"" barrel and a slender, modern classic style, laminated hardwood stock. It is what Remington refers to as a ""Specialty"" rifle. Remington literature says that the Model 700 Mountain Rifle is designed for wilderness or high country pack-in hunts that involve rigorous hiking.

In the Remington world, ""LSS"" signifies a rifle with laminated wood stock and stainless steel metal parts. The internal magazine has a hinged floorplate with a trigger guard mounted release. The stock is stained a medium walnut brown color. The barreled action is made from satin finished 416 stainless steel. It is a good looking rifle that stops just this side of being gaudy--a line that other stainless/laminated rifles often, unfortunately, cross to their detriment. The stock has a tough synthetic finish to protect it from the elements. It also has a black forearm tip, a black pistol grip cap, a solid rubber butt pad and studs for detachable sling swivels. It is checkered in a generous and deeply laser cut point pattern that wraps completely around the forearm. Calibers offered in 2008 are .270 Winchester, .280 Remington, 7mm-08 and .30-06.

Remington Model 700 rifles have always had an excellent reputation for accuracy and that has been my experience with them. To this day the deluxe models remain among the best shooting and nicest looking production rifles on the market.

Note: Full reviews of the Model 700 Mountain Rifle LSS and Model 700 CDL SF can be found on the Product Reviews page.

I have changed out the forward pistol grip/heat shield with another amd65 heat shield and added rails to mount a Mako folding foregrip, it makes the gun more ergonomic and easier to change 30 rnd. mags and adds a buffer area between your hand and the shield. In its original configuration the pistol grip would get in the way of a 30 round mag change and the side of your hand would be touching against the heat shield and would get hot.

It is a wire stock side fold configuration, as intended originally for tank crews and paratroopers i guess.

I'm selling the rifle, along with right at 2500 rounds of 7.62x39 and 20 mags (some 30 round and some 20 round steel and poly) because I am moving back to NC to be closer to my kids. So this must go.. I'm asking a firm $1200.00

If you are looking for a load-bearing vest designed for special operations and tactical situations, look no farther. In partnership with Kyle Lamb, 5.11 Tactical Series has produced the ultimate load-bearing platform. The LBE Vest is made from a stiffened mesh that provides the necessary structure for all your gear, yet allows air in for ventilation and breathability. The LBE Vest has our hidden document pockets and is fully compatible with our VTAC Slickstickâ¢ pouches or standard molle gear. A grab handle is located on the interior of the vest, not visible to an outsider, but there if you need it. A hydration pocket is also located on the interior of the back of the vest. The LBE Vest is adjustable in girth and length. We use only quality YKKÂ® zippers and high quality high impact plastic clips.

You can use any number of our Slickstickâ¢ accessories to customize your LBE Vest for any situation. The 5.11 Slickstickâ¢ accessories are compatible with standard molle attachment systems, yet functions like none other. The Slickstickâ¢ slides through a UV-resistant ring making it easier to arrange and attach your pouches and other gear. Slickstick attaches like a normal molle attachment, but it slides to make it easier. To remove an item, just pop the snap and pull the stick out. The design combination of our LBE and our Slickstickâ¢ accessories give you an unlimited variety of configurations."

1)  3rd Gen Glock 19, doesn't look like it's seen a lot of use.  I properly installed some Trijicon night sights on it but they are getting a little dim.  The grip on it is made by Talon Gun Grips.  Think of it as a softer version of grip tape.  I think it's surprisingly comfortable.  It peels right off if you don't want it.  Comes with 2 mags and the old Glock box.  I let the other guy keep the clamshell.  I can also install an extended slide stop if you're interested.  Asking $500"

You know you always wanted one and nowâs your chance to get it ALL in one low price! 

You get everything listed below. Only 626 rounds have been put through the rifle and it was cleaned after each range trip (you will received the barrel log and owners manual with the sale). Cosmoline was removed prior to the first firing, so no gummy surprises. NO CORROSIVE AMMO HAS EVER BEEN FIRED THROUGH IT!

We experimented with different brands of ammo and the Herterâs brand steel cased rounds are the tightest grouping ones weâve tested. So, the ammo youâre getting with it shoots a real nice group. The rifle has a chrome lined barrel, no canted sights/gas tube, and comes with a cleaning rod. I replaced the furniture with a TAPCO 6-position M4 style stock with a recoil-reducing rubber butt pad. It also has a very nice Hogue rubber foregrip. It SIGNIFICANTLY improves the grip and reduces the heatâ¦ your hand doesnât feel like itâs melting after a few mags. The gas tube cover is vented as well, keeping you operational longer. The front sight post was replaced with a colored one for easy target acquisition (extra posts of different colors included).   

It comes with 8 magazines total (30 rds each). 3 are metal, 5 are TAPCO. All have been spray/sponge painted into the MARPAT digital woodland camo color (see pics). Matte sealer was also applied so the finish will last. My next project was to paint the entire rifle, so the mags were the test case. No paint chipped off of them!

In full disclosure, one of the metal mags gave me problems the last time it was out. I havenât pulled out the calipers to check tolerances, but Iâd guess some dremel work on the feed lips are in order (Iâve corrected almost a dozen metal AK mags for that problem; the bottom of bolt rubs one of the feed lips, slowing it down and stopping the round from being chambered). I didnât want to mess with it and go put more rounds down range knowing I was selling it. 

Other than that, you have a kick-butt rifle setup, ready to rock and roll.

I have seen the asking and selling prices for this pistol between 600-1000. I dont have a set price but will not give it away either, I have no problem leaving it in the safe. If interested please feel free to contact ,e at REDACTED by calling or text."

This is THE best all around .22 tactical assault riffle out there. It has a nice scope that is zeroed in and super accurate. 2 30-round banana style magazines and original 10-round clip. Fun and cheap to shoot all day long. Why buy a .223 ar-15 that you can't afford the ammo for. It was only a special run that Remington made so there are not that many out there for sale. This one I found brand new this year and has about 1000 round through it. Just been cleaned and oiled.
