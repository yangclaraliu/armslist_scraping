This is the baddest handgun ammo in the market. May be your last chance to own.  Here is a description from Wiki: The SS190 FMJ, a refinement of the SS90, was introduced in 1993. It offered superior performance over the prototype projectile as well as slightly reduced length. The latter change allowed it to be used more conveniently in the Five-seven pistol also being developed at that time. Fired from the P90, the SS190 propels a 2.0-g (31 grain) bullet at a muzzle velocity of roughly 715 m/s (2,350 ft/s). It has a steel penetrator and an aluminum core. The SS190 has been manufactured with a plain, black, or black-on-white tip color. Buyer is responsible for legal use in his area. Seller assumes no liability.

I have no use for them and, in fact, had forgotten all about them until today.  They're not antiques.  They are Italian made, .36 caliber Navy model, 6 shot, black powder revolvers.  I did inspect them today and they both have shiny bores, nice clear rifling, and rust free cylinder bores.  Blueing is well worn so they look old.  I'm not sure of the year of manufacture but I think it must be in the 1970's to very early 80's.  They both have 4 digit serial numbers.  No manufacturer's name I can fine.  Both say, ""Made in Italy, .36 cal. Navy.  Black Powder Only.""  One has a 5"" barrel, the larger one has a 7 1/2 inch barrel.  They are complete with the exception of the front sight bead on the shorter one.  The shorter one has a super smooth action, appears to have been shot more than the larger one.  Sorry I don't recall anything about my fathers use of them but he was interested in Cowboy shooting at the approximate dates I have given.  $200 for both OBO. + shipping.  These should be exempt from background checks in most areas.  They are in CT, at least for the moment."

That's the Gun, Here's the story: I ordered this last Oct. for a bird hunt, it was back ordered so I bought an O/U. I forgot the back order and so did the dealer. Guess what, it arrived 1/28/13. I don't need it, so if you do. Save yourself $55 and sales tax & grab this one. As you may know; Baikal was Imported & Marketed by Remington. Baikal is now on it own. It's a Very Nice NEW Shotgun for Not a Lot of Money. 
Like Joe Biden says: ""forget the AR, if you want to defend your family and home, buy a shotgun"".

You also have the owners manual, the sling, the 5 round magazine, and 3x aftermarket 30 round magazines. You also get the gun case for it and about 200 rounds of ammo. 

It shoots like a dream. For those that don't know, these are amongst the highest quality AK's you can get. These were built in Egypt, but the factory was set up by the Russians, so everything is up to spec of the original AK's.

Make me an offer an I will give it consideration. Here is your chance to get a great deal on a top of the line barrel for your 1911.

Barsto Precision semi drop in barrel.
5"" semi drop in barrel, black oxide finish, matched barrel bushing.

New in plastic, and has never been installed in a pistol.
I ordered this for a replica build of the USMC's MEU(SOC) 45 or M45 pistol, but decided to scrap the project for something else. This is the exact barrel that the armorers at the USMCs precision weapons shop install on the custom built M45.

If you have been thinking about upgrading the barrel in your 1911, save yourself a few bucks and the 3-5 month wait to get one of these high quality barrels from the manufacturer.

This barrel goes for 315.00 from barsto (215 for stock barrel + 100 for black oxide finish).

Barsto advertises 1.5""@25 yard accuracy out of these barrels. Better than most of us could hope to shoot under normal conditions!

Awesome Semi-Auto .223/556 Rifle. less than 50 rounds through it. 
Overview:

An unrivaled combination of precision accuracy, blazing-fast follow-ups and hunt-specific features. The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality.
For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And the new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. The semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This firearm has the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage and open country. It comes with a five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories. The R-15 VTR Predator Rifle has a 22"" barrel and is the best choice for long shots.

I am only willing to meet at a local gun store in Raleigh to do a legal FFL transfer, no negotiations on that. Feel free to email me with any questions. I will respond quickly. Please leave a phone number in your email so I can contact you. Make me an offer!!!"

This is loaded ammunition, a one piece plastic bullet and case with aluminium rim. Presumably used for short range training (I have shot it in the basement with proper backstop). This discharges with enough lethal velocity to separate the bullet from the case but not enough energy to rack the slide on a typical automatic pistol.  

Has functioned well in Beretta 92, Beretta CX4 Storm, Sig P6, Sig 226, Walther PPQ, Glock 17, 19, 26, 34, Taurus PT111 and M&P9.  Accuracy great to 10 yards and good to 25 yards.  No recoil and builds muscle memory by simulating fail to extract issues.

Manufactured by German maker Dynamit Nobel A-G, each round is labeled DAG and 9mm Luger on the side. Your 5 boxes are factory sealed! Fun to shoot or collect.

The 80 Percent anodized AR-15 lower receiver is our standard 80 AR-15 lower receiver with mil-spec hard coat anodizing.

These 80 Percent AR-15 Lower receivers start as 7075-T6 forgings from the lead forge in the US and are fully machined to mil-spec tolerances. The operations left to be completed are as follows/ fire control group, trigger pin, hammer pin, trigger slot and the safety selector hole. These are anodized with a mil-spec type III hard coat anodizing. This is a not an FFL item. This is not a complete receiver and still requires machining to be done.

I am a gunsmith in Lakewood CO and I fit this bbl and stock last spring. I performed most of the custom work on the rifle myself in the last two years. I hunted with it for one season. It has had approx 30 rounds through it as a result of test firing and sighting in the scope (antique bushnell horse hair scope w/ leopold mounts included). Stock shows minimal signs of wear and oil spots from being carried through the field, no damage or scratching to wood or metal work. Extractor is still very stiff, but gun functions flawlessly. 

Comes with soft case and nice soft/padded hunting sling. Has custom sling swivel mounts installed on stock.

You can pay 1700 for an AR that will be worth less than 1000 in a few months, or grap a piece of history guaranteed to hold its resale value. Ammo is priced 1/2 of what the high dollar .223 is. Magazines  and bayonet priced fairly too. A sweet package deal. 
Lets add it up:
M1-900.00 (conservative) stock alone worth over 275.00
1000 rnds ammo- 500.00 ?? Depends on day 
6 -15 rnd @ 15 ea - 90.00 (valued over 20-25 ea)

I am only interested in a straight across trade.  My 9mm is in great condition, comes with factory storage box, papers, original factory test round, and 2 16rd mags.  It is the full size frame and has been a blast to shoot, however since I am getting my CC permit, I am looking for something in a compact frame.  For this reason I am looking to trade.  Also, my wife's hands are smaller and she finds a compact frame more comfortable to shoot.  So if you have a compact frame 9mm that you are willing to trade, hit me back and I can answer questions that you may have.  I am stationed here at Ft Carson, even though my number is out of state.  I am NOT going to travel 2 hours to meet, sorry, Colorado Springs only, and face to face transaction.  If you are not military, I would like to see your CC permit, or CO ID showing you are of age to own, and sign a bill of sale.  If you are offering a trade in a different caliber, I am willing to throw in ammunition that I have on hand provided you are willing to do the same.  I have 1.5 boxes (65-75rds) of 115gr FMJ, and 1 box of Magtech (20) 124gr JHP as well as about 2 boxes of once fired brass, I have a uncle mikes IWB neoprene holster, and a universal fit ambidextrous hip holster as well.

I have a full sized tactical and a commander sized 1911 and it works great for both of them. I live in frederick near the highway 119 and I-25 exit, and if interested I would need to meet around my area. I am willing to travel from Hwy 34 to 136th (the Walmart on the corner). As a political science and criminal justice major, I, personally don't see much legislation passing to the degree that everyone thinks. But none the less, there is a possibility that we can no longer buy these mags in the near future. I am asking 35 dollars which I think is fair considering the prices of mags that i see on here, but i am also not hard pressed for that amount. If interested MAKE AN OFFER. I will consider all offers that are presented and will try my best to reply to all.  I can send pics, or give more information if needed. I would also consider trades in ammo but all that i need would be .45acp, .40 s&w, 9mm Luger."

The operations left to be completed are as follows/ fire control group, trigger pin, hammer pin, trigger slot and the safety selector hole. These are anodized with a mil-spec type III hard coat anodizing. This is a not an FFL item. This is not a complete receiver and still requires machining to be done.

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest."
