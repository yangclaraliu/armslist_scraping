The frame and slide were both forged there, as well as the small parts. The early models (marked with the Star of David) were all built in Israel, while later models were essentially parts kits sourced from the Philippines. From what I've read the early models are pretty desirable (if you're looking for an Israeli 1911) as there weren't that many that made it to America and they are of a much higher build/parts quality than their Filipino counterparts.

I've got a Commander length, forged stainless frame, blued slide, Israeli 1911 for trade. I bought this recently from this website and am going in a different direction. I bought it to be a carry gun then a week later found a killer deal on a Sig. The Sig is might lighter on the belt

Pistol comes with an old OWB Galco holster and 2 magazines. One is a CMC 8 rounder that works great in the pistol, the other is the factory magazine that will sometimes fail to feed. I believe the feedlips are too wide on the factory mag. This pistol is all stock, as it came from the factory. They are not Hogue grips, but what the Israelis put on them as a factory option."

What makes this one different is it's one of a small # that Anheuser Busch / Michelob had speically made with a gold coin in the stock back in the late 60's early 70's.  Supposedly they made 500 but most were destroyed in a flood in their storage facility and destroyed.  Gun has some very light surface rust that can probably be removed by the right person and has damage around the gold coin.  I am including a space Fancy wood stock, very hard to find considering they only fit the classic models.  Coin could be put into this stock.

Twin Kar-Bar pistol daggers configured horizontally vs under the barrel.

the ak74 is built on the traditional ak47 chassis but fit to fire the russian 5.45x39 rd (about the same as a 223, but more of a tumbler once it hits the target). also an extremely cheap round to fire, i buy spam cans at fleet farm 1080 rds= 130-150 bucks. as compared to 223 which will run you 4-500 bucks for the same quantity.

bullpup meaning it has the same length barrel, its just the body of the gun that is configured differently to achieve such a short rifle. hence short tactical rifle without loosing long range accuracy. 

I eliminated the wobbly sight mount cia put on there and and added a better sight mount that came with the saiga forgrip. solid as a rock now. 

this gun is a blast to shoot, i hate to see it go, but im on to my next project rifle and need the fundage.

We stock a rim-fire target that is safe, small, yet VERY loud. This product does not have the same properties of standard Tannerite rifle targets.  If shot in a dry hay field, these could initiate a fire. Although they pass drop-tests and are safe with any normal handling procedures, we donât want a customer to mistake them with Tanneriteâs unusually safe properties. Although they wonât explode from a flame or cigarette, they can burn at a fast rate if they come in contact with fire, so just follow the precautions stated on the package."

One of the primary reasons for the .30-30's popularity amongst deer hunters is its light recoil. Average recoil from a typical 150-grain (9.7 g) load at 2,390 feet per second (730 m/s) in a 7.5-pound (3.4 kg) rifle is 10.6 pounds-force (47 N) of felt recoil at the shooter's shoulder. This, combined with the cartridge's ability to take the majority of large game in North America, as long as the game is within 200 yards (180 m) of the shooter, results in a highly effective hunting round."

Except for the Remington 572 (probably 60's vintage) I purchased all these firearms new.  They are all in excellent to pristine condition with low, low round counts.  Price is firm so please no e-mails asking what my lowest price is.  I think this is a reasonable price for the lot.

VA residents 21+ only.  I will write up a bill of sale showing both parties IDs so we both have a good record of the transaction.

I will try to list everything included and am glad to answer specific questions.

*Ruger Mini-14:  SS & wood, carbine not ranch model, 1x5-20-30 rd magazine, sporting scope, hard transportation case, manual, sling. 
*Ruger Blackhawk .357:  blue, 6.5"" barrel, made in the pre-rush year of 2005 (no lock), has typical light Ruger ring on cylinder but no blueing wear as never holstered. Have original box, manual, and fired case.
*Remington 870 Express Magnum:  12 gauge, 21"" bbl, low glare finish on gun and stocks.  improved cylinder & turkey full choke, soft case, sling, rifled and smooth barrels, extension tube gives 7+1 capacity. 
*Remington Fieldmaster 572:  .22 long, short, & lr. with same vintage soft case, scope (I think for air rifle originally).  This rifle was my father's.  I don't think he shot it much and I shot it a few times in high school.  It's been in climate-controlled storage for 20+ years.  No exaggeration - this is in great condition, no scratches, stocks are beautiful, blueing is not worn anywhere it shouldn't be, i.e. where metal touches when pumping, but that's it.  
*Winchester (Daisy) 722X: .22 cal spring piston air rifle.  Gorgeous stocks and shoots great.
*Crosman American Classic 1377:  .177 cal pump air pistol.  very accurate and fun.

   I have hunted this rifle since the late 80's don't remember exactly when I got it.  It has a few marks on it as you would expect for 30 years of hunting.  

  .338 can really do it all with the exception of varmints, 160-180 grain bullets from Barnes or Nosler work very well for deer sized animals right out to 500 yards.  Step up to 200-225 grain bullets for larger game like elk, moose.  If you are going for brown or polar bears or on an Africa hunt the 250-300 grain slugs are the way to go.

  Old age and poor health tell me I need to pass this fine rifle on to another hunter, it has served me well and I'm sure it will you also.

 I will ship anywhere in Montana, but buyer will pay shipping.
  I WILL NOT SHIP OUT OF STATE so don't ask.

Purchased new. Very Good Cond.  Have the BOSS wrench and standard recoil piece.  Leupold Vari X II 3-9X40 Scope with box and felt bag. Browning Rifle Soft Case, Browning Strap, I have a box or two of shells as well that go with it. This is an awesome big game setup; I just donât hunt anymore and have no use for it. This thing was hitting right on at 100 yds  with a very tight group last time I shot it in 2009. Ready to hunt! The 300 WIN Mag is the most versatile big game rifle offering the most variety of bullet grains. Hunt Antelope with 165 Grain, Deer and Elk with 180 Grain or Moose a Grizzly with 220 Grain.  The 180 Grain makes this one of the best long range Calibers and bullet weight.  Winchester trajectory tables show that the 180 grain Power Point Plus bullet zeroed at 200 yards rises only 1.4"" at 100 yards and falls just 6.4"" at 300 yards. This is identical to the trajectory for the 130 grain Power Point Plus bullet in the famous .270 Winchester caliber. Obviously, Winchester's .300 is a fine long range big game cartridge.

The flip side of launching heavy bullets at high velocity is recoil, and abundant recoil is the dark side of all .300 Magnum cartridges. You can't cheat Mother Nature or the laws of physics.---The BOSS System Revolutionizes this though.  This 300 Win Mag has the kick of a 270 or lesser powered rifle thanks to the excellence of Browning's BOSS System. 

For those not familiar with Browningâs BOSS system. Ballistics Optimizing Shooting System is a fully adjustable muzzle break with settings for each specific brand and grain of shell. Allows you to fine tune your groupings to amazingly tight patterns.  For those who like the standard recoil of the 300 Win Mag, the standard recoil BOSS attachment is also included.

Asking $775 or Trade for SS 44 Mag revolver or SS 40 Cal Semi Auto Handgun.  Might take partial trade of other decent quality firearms.  I'm willing to seperate from the scope if desired."

The M6A2â¢ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2â¢ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 âreal estateâ to mount your accessories.

The Russian Tokarev was a military service pistol produced in Russia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Poland, North Korea, Egypt and China. The Tokarev typically chambers the powerful 7.62x25mm bottleneck cartridge. The Chinese made a unique variant chambered in 9mmâthe Norinco 213â for the civilian market. The State Factory 66-manufactured all-steel 213 is nearly identical to the Russian TT-33 Tokarev with one key difference: an additional frame mounted safety. (Given the similarities. some gun guys speculate that the Hungarian Tokagypt 9mm pistol inspired the 213.) The 213 is pleasant to shoot, remarkably accurate and reliable.

I recently took a new job with a company car and I am no longer in need of my former daily driver. This vehicle has 156k on the odo most of which are highway miles zipping up and down the turnpike to Tulsa, Lawton, and down 35 to Dallas. This vehicle has some light hail and a little damage to the rear bumper but not bad at all. It is a very reliable, fuel efficient vehicle. On the highway I usually get around 30mpg and I am not in a tuna can!! Tons of room. I put two new tires on about a month ago. I would have put all 4 but I knew I would be selling it soon. The back two still have some tread left so I didn't see the point in replacing them yet. The lock actuators on the back doors do not work so those I just operate manually. There is only myself or 1 other person riding with me 99% of the time so it did not bother me at all. The interior is very clean non smoking, charcoal cloth interior. I have an aftermarket xm receiver that is installed. No mechanical issues other than the door. Has been the most dependable car I have owned. Overall a very good car for the money

This car would be perfect for a daily driver as it has been mine for the last 3 years. I know some of you big truck drivers looking to save some gas and wear and tear on you truck this would be a great option.

I'll post a few pics but if you need more or have any questions let me know. This is a great car at an aggressive price. I have an Oklahoma title and lien release in hand. The tags are paid through next August (2013).

Looking to get $4000 obo. Will look at firearms as partial trade. Let me know REDACTED or email me."
