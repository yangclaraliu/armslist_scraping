The trigger I put in has a slender trigger bar in the back so it doesn't contact the grip safety, if you switched out the grip safety or trigger it would work.

The handgun comes with one 8 round magazine that came with the gun.  I have put around 200 rounds through the gun, and it has run without any malfunctions.  I've only run brass cased Winchester rounds through this gun.  This has been strictly a range gun, and has spent all of its time in a climate controlled safe.

Walther PPS is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses modified Browning type locking with tilting barrel. Frame of the gun is made from impact resistant polymer. Trigger is of double action only type, striker fired, with pre-cocked striker system, similar to QA system used in Walther P99 pistols. This system requires a manual recocking (by partial slide retraction) in the case of misfire. Gun is fitted with automated trigger safety and firing pin block; additional ""storage type"" safety is provided by removable backstrap of the grip; once backstrap is removed, the firing pin is automatically decocked and gun is blocked until the backstrap is reinstalled. This patented system is called QuickSafe by Walther. Sights are low profile, with rear sight adjustable for windage."

In case you doin't know a cache of these rifles laid undisturbed in the palace for over 100 years in far from perfect storage conditions.
  The lever on this one opens and closes the breech action pretty smoothly - it could probably be cleaned up really good & fired as long as you get the firing pin/mechanism working.....Looks complete as far as I can see, lever action, trigger, 2 steel bands, stock (in pretty decent condition considering the age), cleaning rod & butt plate...alot of these have frozen/siezed actions, but not this one..
  Legally considered an antique, you don't need a U.S. Federal Firearms License to own or transfer this rifle. 
  Can ship to you, for $25 UPS (Pay via PAYPAL) as long as your state/city doesn't have some goofy law against it..

A reliable handgun chambered to fire the inexpensive and plentiful .22 Long Rifle cartridge is truly a treasure to own. Though most .22 pistols follow standard design, This model allows you to stand out in a crowd. 

The Wolverine is a revival of the 1950's pistol designed by Robert L Hillberg. It has a super-sleek design reminiscent of science fiction ray guns, with a tough polymer frame and a vented rib. Most shooters find this pistol fits their hands and points quite naturally. The magazine shell is all metal for strength and durability, and the pistol is easily disassembled without tools. The Whitney Wolverine is available in a variety of colors, and it can be dressed up with wooden grips, a flash suppressor, and an adjustable rear sight."

Walther PPS is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses modified Browning type locking with tilting barrel. Frame of the gun is made from impact resistant polymer. Trigger is of double action only type, striker fired, with pre-cocked striker system, similar to QA system used in Walther P99 pistols. This system requires a manual recocking (by partial slide retraction) in the case of misfire. Gun is fitted with automated trigger safety and firing pin block; additional ""storage type"" safety is provided by removable backstrap of the grip; once backstrap is removed, the firing pin is automatically decocked and gun is blocked until the backstrap is reinstalled. This patented system is called QuickSafe by Walther. Sights are low profile, with rear sight adjustable for windage."

It has the new 1 gig of dedicated Graphics memory and anoth 512MB built in which makes it fly.  This computer is worth over 3200 dollars with no software installed but I am willing to take quite a bit less in trade.   I will add a Business edition install of Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 with all of the programs including Word, Powerpoint, Excel and Outlook.      I have its box and everything it came with.  This computer is amazing. Not one scratch or dent. Its beautiful and is only a month old.   It has 1 year of APPLE CARE on it, meaning IF ANYTHING, I mean ANYTHING they will replace it or fix it if its just a small problem.      I will be including a $65 dollar hard snap on case made by INCASE that protects the computer and an $80 dollar INCASE carrying case as well.

The GI model is designed with slightly looser tolerances to accommodate all the crappy .308/762x51mm you get for cheap or steal from the range. The SN on this rifle is well outside the range of ""defects"" that PTR let out (those rifles are SNs 0001-0250), and when headspaced at the store it was at .333mm. After firing and cleaned it was at .25mm, well within acceptable boundaries. The rollers are those that all PTRs come with, and oversized rollers WILL NOT be necessary until your round count is at least in the 5000s, if that.

I've fired 120 rounds of Lake City M80 reloads (VERY clean-shooting), 40+ rounds of Silver Bear, and 40 rounds of Wolf. Never any FTF, FTE, malfunctions, etc. Shoots reasonably accurate, no adjustments to the sights had to be made at all.

I have 9 20rd magazines total for it, 1 PTR-91 Inc mag, and 8 West German surplus aluminum mags that have been cleaned of cosmoline and have no rust on the followers. 

The DMS-1/mount is optional, it's a damn good 1-4x scope and I could use it on any of my other guns. If you want it without the optic then I'll bring it down to 950.

Here are a few of the questions we have designed the Defensive Pistol course curriculum to specifically address: 

• Do I know what type of people commit crimes, how they commit them, who they commit them against, and how to spot tell-tale signs of a crime about to happen? 

•Is my pistol a defensive tool I know how to competently operate, or am I merely expecting its mere presence and noise when fired to stop an attack? 
•Can I pull the trigger on a justified deadly force threat that is attempting to do serious physical injury or even kill me? 

•Am I a good enough shot to consistently hit what I'm aiming at without endangering those around me? 

•Do I know how to get my gun back in the fight quickly when it malfunctions? 
•What if one or two shots aren't enough to stop an assailant? What if ten shots isn't enough? 




COURSE OVERVIEW: 

Defensive Pistol 1 is one full day of training including lecture, practical exercises, and live fire on the range. Many courses are focused on the needs of law enforcement and military. This pistol-focused class is designed for people who want to acquire real-world defensive pistol skill sets designed specifically for civilian carry.



YOU WILL LEARN: 

•How to select an appropriate firearm 
•How to manipulate your firearm as a defensive tool 

•How to shoot accurately and consistently, and how to speed up consistent accuracy 

•Quickly clearing malfunctions when your firearm experiences them 



YOU WILL NEED: 

•***Please Note: all below equipment is available for rental/purchase as needed - try before you buy! Don't let a lack of gear stop you from taking this class!***
 •A semi-automatic pistol and at least 2 magazines 

•200 rounds of ammunition
 •Ear and eye protection 

•A folding camp chair for your comfort 
•Money for lunch 

•Proper attire for the weather and conditions 
•A hat and/or sunscreen is advisable 




In self-defense, we only get one chance to do it right: the first time. We need to find out the realities of self-defense in a safe, controlled training environment where we get a ""do-over"" when our preparations or equipment fails. We do NOT want to find out what doesn't work in a dirty mall parking lot where failure means serious bodily harm or even death; we would much rather discover those deficiencies in our preparation and equipment in training so we won't have to fail when it matters! 

You will never be set up to fail in this course. Our staff is certified, friendly, competent, proficient, fun, and professional. This course is designed to improve you from the very first moment you step in our door, starting from any skill level, with your own equipment, because the edge that you acquire from training will translate to a life-saving difference when it matters most. Pay attention in class, apply what you learn, and you will succeed in every single exercise!"

 This is an older Remington auto shotgun with a 20'' modified barrel on it with one site bead. Shoots only 2 3/4 shells, has wood stock. She is old and shows her years of use, but is in excellent working condition. This was the days of changing barrels instead of chokes, so it also comes with a 29'' Skeet barrel with 2 site beads on it. Again shows years of use, but no rust.

Rifle, its' original serial number matching box, a Ruger factory 5 round magazine, and a set of matching Stainless Steel scope rings. This rifle's serial number is 188-xxxxx which places its' manufacture in 1990, clearly produced before the 1994 Assault Ban. This is a beautiful, LIKE NEW, example of an early Pre Ban Ranch rifle. The MSRP for a current model without the nice wood stock is $949.....I don't even think a Laminate Stock is even offered anymore. Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger Mini 14 rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. The popularity of these fine rifles has created an aftermarket of accessories that can modify these rifles into anything you can imagine, from folding tactical stocks, high capacity magazines, to the most advanced optic mounts; the options are limitless. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles. Here is a chance to own a 100% Mini 14 Ranch of Pre Ban manufacture in Stainless Steel with a beautiful Laminate stock. This Ruger may have been fired but not since it has been in my collection, it is spotless, the bore is bright and shiny, and the rifling is crisp and clear. Please see picture for its outstanding condition. This Ruger Mini 14 Ranch will make a great addition to anyones collection. ANY TRADES TO BE CONSIDERED WOULD BE IN MY FAVOR. $550 Firm"

I came across this sweet looking gun, and really know nothing much at all about it. What we have here a beautiful Flli Pietta - Made in Italy .36 cal. Black Powder Gun. Has assorted markings on it? BZ in a box, PN with a star over it, 2 crossed 16 May 1643 on it, says also Engraved by W.L. Oresby New York & Patent No., but no number is there? Say Hartford on top of barrel. Beautiful wood grips have some initials on on side, just can not figure out what they are. I read that this is their Colt type version of this gun. Also that they can be converted to a regular shell type gun. Serial number is # 525461, it is a beautiful gold frame and black barrel and cylinder. When cocked the trigger has notch to use as sight when lined up with little gold ball at end of barrel. She is in georgous condition. A little bar knocks out to remove the cylinder, I'm told this is a cap and ball type blackpowder gun, a 6 shooter. Comes with a beautiful leather case and belt.

Great Spanish Airforce crest on receiver, no importers markings, all matching except for bolt (these were frequently changed in the armory when rifles were serviced or refurbished). No splits or cracks in wood, just some minor handling and storage dings. About 80% to 90% original arsenal finish, bright bore, mechanically excellent. Includes bayonet that fits perfectly, but not original to this rifle. Still, looks great for display. Missing cleaning rod, but any Mauser cleaning rod will work as replacement for display. Shoots great and includes 74 rounds of surplus ammunition. Ammo is sure fire good ammo, but corrosive like most military ammo, so clean the rifle after you use it.

Burris Technology

Burris uses lenses with a greater diameter than the competition
• “Signature Select” scopes lenses are 40% larger than the competition in 1” tubes
• “Fullfield II” lenses are 25% larger than the competition in 
1” tubes

MODEL TUBE DIAMETER LENSES DIAMETER
Black Diamond™ 30 mm 15.4 mm
Euro Diamond™ 30 mm 15.4 mm
Signature Select™ 25.4 mm 15.4 mm
Fullfield® II 25.4 mm 13.8 mm
Others 30 mm 15 mm
Others 25.4 mm 11.0 mm



Unique Technical Features
The outer tubes & internal components are extremely robust.
The adjustment system is:
- repeatable
- steel on steel
- with audible clicks
Double internal spring force. Every Burris scope has it.



Posi-Lock
• Posi-Lock is a coil-spring assisted retractable steel post that firmly and & securely locks accuracy into place. 
• Once the reticle is zeroed, the covering tube (red) replaces the internal spring (green) & locks the inner tube in place. 
• All scopes have one spring that allows the adjustment of the reticle. 
Some of the competition competitors offer a double spring whereas the double spring is the STANDARD for all Burris products. 
• As an optional, it’s possible to have the special Posi-Lock system. 
Posi-Lock scopes remain perfectly zeroed year after year even during transportation.

In the closed position, the force of the spring is substituted by the force of the steel post on the internal tube of the scope.



On all rifle scopes:
• Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope
• Every scope is individually recoil, water and fogproof tested 
• Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage



Recoil Test
Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests
An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration.
This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.

Waterproof Test
All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof.
Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C.
The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. 


Fog Test
The nitrogen contained in the scope is:
• of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen)
• ultra pure
• ultra clean
To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of 
• pressurizing the scope
• subjecting it to a vacuum
The tests are both cost & time intensive


I do not have the packaging for either item.
