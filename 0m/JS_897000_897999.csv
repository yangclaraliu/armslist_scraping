With all this craziness if you weren't able to get an AR this is a great alternative, especially this .40 cal version, the 9mm verison is under powered and the 45 is a slower round. But this .40 SW version coming out of the longer carbine barrel it reaches 10mm round stopping power and the ammo is a lot easier to find that .223/5.56. Comes with 1 10 round Magazine, Factory trigger lock, and factory Hi-Point tool.

From Sig: The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Shiny bore and tight breech lock. No Rust or pitting. Was refinished in some kind of wonder finish or something similar. has a few scratches to the finish but they are not gouged into the metal. the stock is in pretty good shape. All around great gun for everyday use. Toss it  into the bottom of the duck boat and don't worry, it will fire when you need it to.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order: 

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information: 

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are a effing retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S. 

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."

If you are interested in collecting a fine example of a Nevada Centennial Scout, then this might be the one you have been waiting for.

Original issue price is reported to be around $75 and 3984 were made.

As far as trades, I will only consider trading to an AR-15, preferably new, but we will see. The accessories on this gun are as follows: Hogue Grip, Magpul rail ladder covers, Magpul MBUS Gen II sights, Trijicon Red/Green Dot sight, & NCStar Green sight laser. I'm not listing a price because I'm looking for offers. You can also locate this on gunbroker.com under auction 326887479. It does have a reserve and buy it now option.

I purchased this for my collection and it has sat in my safe for too long. Time for someone else to enjoy it. The Daewoo is one of the best designed semi- auto rifles that I have ever encountered. It utilizes the gas piston system of the AK47 and the bolt and receiver of similar design of the AR15. This rifle strait up uses the AR 15 trigger group, so replacement parts for the fire control group are not an issue. That along with the chrome-lined barrel help make this probably the most accurate 7.62x39 rifle you will ever fire. This rifle comes with 2 magazines. It will be shipped in a hard case and insured for the full value of the rifle. You will hardly ever see one of these for sale. Reason being once you own one you never want to get rid of it. they are just that good. As for me I have bills to pay.... The bidding on this rifle will start at $1400.00.

*sarcasm* Surely putting this on an innocent looking Charger will convert it into the ultimate Assault Weapon and require it banned, as it will be magically transformed into a tool of death and destruction instead of a handy plinker.  LOOK AT IT!!!! LOOK!!!  IT'S EVIL!!!  You can tell 'cause it's black and has RAILS, and *gasp* a free-floating foregrip, which instead of enhancing accuracy is only used to keep your hands from being burned as you rapidly bust caps!  Think of the children, the children!!! */sarcasm*

This is the standard version(as opposed to the deluxe which includes flip up sights).  New in package, never mounted.  Will ship.

I've had quite a few inquiries as to the exact model of this gun.  This a 686 Silver Essential.  These were designed as no non-sense field guns.  They have all the functional features of the higher end 686s but lack fancy stocks, scrollwork, etc.  The blueing is 100% with no thin spots, rust, or pits.  There is a little finish wear on the reciever, the paint is worn on the trigger, and the stock has been refinished at some point."

Please see the following link on the Trijicon website for more information:

http://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=TX30

Some of the features of this sight include:

Retical (red dot) is a 14.4 MOA red chevron, great for close quarters work and shorter range plinking
Retical is powered by 3 separate, independent sources (sunlight via fiber optic, tritium, and a backup battery)
Standard sized 30mm tube for easy mounting, with a ring mount with a weaver base included
Completely sealed, waterproof to 100ft

Trijicon sights are 100% American made, and are built to stand up against stout recoil and rough conditions.  While this unit does have an electronic light source, it does not rely on sophisticated electronics or lasers to generate the retical pattern.  This means that there are fewer parts that can fail.  That is why I believe Trijicon fiber optic sights such as this are an excellent, highly reliable choice for any shooter.  This sight would be equally at home on a home defense carbine as it would a plinker, with the operator knowing that he or she could count on this sight lighting up each and every time, even after sitting in a safe for years.  This is the sort of technology you could give to your children, and be confident in its function.

This unit retails for $650 to $700 (search Amazon and Opticsplanet).  I am asking $550 FIRM, cash.  If you are outside the Houston area, please add $15 for shipping via UPS.
