The info below is copied straight from Remington. However, I just took this in trade and it makes me wish I shot right handed. This is a great looking rifle. The Mossy Oak Brush finish is great and now I want it on all my rifles. The gun has a very smooth action, and one of the best triggers (X-Mark Pro) on a rifle I've ever pulled on a stock rifle. 

The Model 700 ADL Varmint in Mossy Oak Brush camo is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700 action; the most solid, dependable and trusted action in existence.

Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to the most popular high-velocity varmint calibers.  Plus, the ergonomically designed synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation.  The Mossy Oak Brush camo stock will remain hidden from sharp predator eyes.  The Model 700 ADL Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.

It shoots a .45 long colt, which prevents errant shots from going into the next county, but I promise you'll be very impressed with the damage a .45 caliber bullet will do to a deer. It is extremely accurate with open sights and not heavy at all. I actually used it a few times as a brush gun when I was hunting in very thick foliage. I will text you pictures upon request.

The same pistol made famous in the 1968 Pulitzer Prize winning photo.  

This pistol came out of an estate.  When I found it, it was wrapped in duct tape and inside some foam padding.  The duct tape ate through the blue into the metal.  I completely disassembled the pistol, sandblasted it down to bare metal, and coated it with Dura Coat flat black.  There is still sign of the damage to the metal visible under the coating.  It also now has a fine cylinder line from turning while shooting.  I replaced the grips with a nice pair of S&W logo grips.  Fun to shoot, without much recoil, but plenty of noise.  I'll include a partial box of ammo if you don't make a stupid offer.

I have barely gotten past the break in procedure. One of the pictures is while I was breaking it in... With the muzzle break this rifle has it kicks less than my ar-10.

Up for sale is my PW87 1887 style lever action 12ga shotgun. This PW87 is patterned after the Winchester 1887 shotgun, infact it funtions the exact same, and looks the exact same (except for the shortened 18 1/2"" barrel.) 

These PW87's are made in China, imported by Century Arms in Georgia, and there extremely well built. The wood and finish is very, very nice. The gun is in great condition, almost new infact. I put 50 rounds down the pipe. You know how it goes, a new gun is catching my eye right now, that's why I'm selling :). The firearm looks exactly like it did when I received it, there is no wear or damage. Holds 5+1, and be ready to rack it hard ;).

Included with the gun is the original box, styrofoam and manual. Most retailers are already sold out of these! 

I'm looking to partial trade for pistol style rifles like the PAP Zastava, SPECTRE, etc. Let me know what you've got! (I've also listed this gun on Midwestguntrader.com) 

Cash only, $400.

High grade walnut stock with the spacers, cap etc. Very nice looking gun. 

Includes Leupold mounting bases and rings. Does not include scope, but I can include that if its a deal breaker. Doesn't include the strap.

The scope is a 3-9x40 Simmons Blazer. It does the job, and holds zero. Its about a $60 scope though. 

Rifle is in great shape. I've only shot it enough to sight it in, and the previous owner did not even put a full box of ammo down range. Super bore. 

The previous owner removed the front and rear sight, but left the original screws. New sights are available for $20. 

Jeweled bolt.

Excellent blueing.

Rifle has never seen a truck, the field or even a rainy day,  but has some typical signs of handling and storage that one would expect for its age. 

A foot away, this thing looks brand new..and in your hands looks new. It has seen little if any use, and has been very well taken care of. 

I bought a scope base that sets the scope further back since I took the pictures. It includes both the original, and the new one.

Functionally 100%

Cosmetically amazing, I would put it at 90% or better.

I'm located in Festus, Missouri.

You can take any game in North America, and some big game in Africa with such a caliber. 

This gun is a a beauty. It looks new, except for the fact that it looks more luster and deep than the new ones. 

They don't make this gun anymore, in .300 Magnum.  Its holding steady in value. 


I will throw in a box of Federal Power-Shok ammo to get ya started.

I really don't want to sell the gun, but I kinda need the money, and I don't get to use it much.  A trade plus cash would be ideal, that way I get a gun, and some much needed money. 

Thanks,
Steve

I have fired 60 rounds and purchased it new about two weeks ago.  It has an extended slide and magazine release, AmeriGlo Night Sights, and two 10 rounds magazines with pinky extensions (both add +1 rounds).  I have all the original paperwork, box, speed loader, brush, etc that came with it when purchased brand new.  

I am interested in an even trade for a Gen4 Glock 19 with night sights.  Must have at least two magazines, box, papers, and be in near-new condition similar to mine.  

I originally purchased this for CCW purposes, but am holding off on getting my carry permit for the time being and would like the 19 as it fits me a little nicer.  You must have a CCW or PP (I have a PP) so all laws will be followed.  

If you're interested in buying, I'll accept $575 which is less than what I paid for the gun plus all the custom work two weeks ago.  I'm more interested in a trade for the 19 Gen 4.  I will *NOT* accept a Gen 1, 2, or 3 as their grip patterns bother me.  I'm sorry, but it must be a Gen 4.  

This gun looks identical to all other Glock 26's with the exception of the night sights.  They're really nice, and I certainly prefer them over the traditional fix glock sights.  Email me if you have any questions.  Please note, I'm not interested in driving across the state.  If you'd like to meet in the Raleigh/Garner area, I'm more than happy to oblige."

My wife wants one of the Team USA Ruger 10/22s (the blue ones) & I can't afford to buy one, so I'd trade this for one of those with a little cash on your end.  Also would trade for a S&W r8 with some cash on my end.  Open to other trades, but not junk or rusty garbage.  Call or text REDACTED"

I got it in a trade a while ago, I am not the original owner, but it is a fantastic shooter and the gun itself is in great condition.

The wood is dinged up a bit, not uncomfortable to use or anything like that but it won't win any beauty pageants. The finish on the gun itself is rock solid. The one magazine it came with is scratched up, looks like the previous owner tried to scratch words into it but I can't decipher them.

Comes with most of a tin of ammunition, I think around 300-400 rounds.

The Cass County Historical Society, Inc. was organized in 1965 for the purpose of discovering, collecting and preserving material which identifies and illustrates the history of this area. We collect material illustrative of life conditions, events and activities of the past and present.

It is loaded with everything you need to hit the water., 2009 Mercury 9.9 motor, AS NEW, pump, oars, tank, everything. It is a BLAST !!! 
There’s a reason the Navy SEALS use Hypalon RIB’s as does the Coast Guard for rescue missions,,,,,they are TOUGH, they are nearly unsinkable and draft very little water. They can carry a ton of weight and go anywhere. This RIB can be carried to the water in it’s own bag. The floor is rigid so it’s very tough, easily beached without harm. I use this on local lakes and also down at the beach on the ICW and on nice days you can hit the open ocean !!! Fishing off the RIB is easy. You can go where no one else can, explore remote locations and beach at secluded beaches no one else can get to!
 This set up was  $5,520.00 new, WITHOUT THE TRAILER and used less than 15 times. This isn’t a cheap rubber raft, this RIB is for real.
 Again, look at the Navy SEAL and Rescue boats, they use RIB’s !!!

I just bought a trailer to make transport even easier ! Then I customized it to also haul the Mercury 9.9 so as to avoid the hassle of putting it in the car trunk, the motor just mounts to the front of the trailer. 

Price is FIRM at $5,000.00, no less. I’m looking for a, GUN COLLECTION, a Harley or a crotch rocket type bike, I don’t want a metric cruiser unless it’s worth more than my RIB.

If the RIB is so great, why am I selling it ???? Simple, I want a BIGGER RIB and need to make room!!! So, it’s for sale/trade, as is my bigger hard boat also."
