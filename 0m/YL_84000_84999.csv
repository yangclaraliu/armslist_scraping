What I have here for sale is a Ruger Mini-30 (7.62x39) with Folding Stock & extras. 

This Ruger was manufactured with a high capacity magazine prior to the 1994 assault weapon ban.

I bought this about 10-15 yrs ago for my collection and ran a few boxes of ammo  through it, and the previous owner stated he had put less than 300 rounds through it. 

It comes with the original 20-round magazine, as well as 2 extra 30-round magazines.
Folding Stock and composite “tactical” hardware are in excellent shape – as new. 
Barrel has a black matte finish - in excellent shape.

It also comes with a “Tac Trigger” that is supposed to make it “like” an “auto”.  Never installed it and I can’t guarantee how well it would work nor it’s legality if installed.

Semi-Auto-22. A living tribute to the genius of Browning.
Few autoloading rimfire rifles have endured the test of time and the marketplace like the Browning SA-22. It stands alone as one of the first autoloading rimfires, and one the most desirable rifles ever made. The SA-22 was one of the last of John M. Browning’s designs, and his genius shines through in every feature. The slim, stylish forged steel receiver and slender barrel takes down into two compact units without tools. The SA-22’s tasteful engraving and select walnut make it an object of lasting beauty and enjoyment. Surely these rifles are meant to be enjoyed in the field as much as they are admired as heirlooms.

A crazed shooter opened fire on a crowd of innocent people. The death count is 6, including a 9 year old child, with at least ten others wounded. Congresswoman Giffords was shot in the head and in critical condition. This is a devastating loss to our nation. There is no doubt and it is unfortunate that some are willing to use this to there political advantage. The liberal media is already pointing fingers at the tea party movement and conservative gun owners. This is a disgrace to good hearted patriotic Americans. If you have time today say a prayer for the wounded and the families who lost thier loved ones.

SA-22. A living tribute to the genius of Browning.
Few autoloading rimfire rifles have endured the test of time and the marketplace like the Browning SA-22. It stands alone as one of the first autoloading rimfires, and one the most desirable rifles ever made. The SA-22 was one of the last of John M. Browning’s designs, and his genius shines through in every feature. The slim, stylish forged steel receiver and slender barrel takes down into two compact units without tools. The SA-22’s tasteful engraving and select walnut make it an object of lasting beauty and enjoyment. Surely these rifles are meant to be enjoyed in the field as much as they are admired as heirlooms. Check out the legendary SA-22 at your Browning dealer today.

Wilson Combat’s® UT-15 Urban Tactical model is an ideal all-around tactical or sporting semi-auto carbine. It offers precise accuracy and fast handling versatility in a lightweight package, with our famous unequalled quality, relentless reliability, and superior service. We start with precision CNC machined upper and lower receivers, using high-quality 7075 T6 aluminum forgings. The upper utilizes a flat-top receiver and a 16.25” free-floated, fluted, match grade barrel. Uppers and lowers are hand-matched by a master riflesmith.
 The UT-15 features a precision JP trigger/hammer, tuned to a crisp 3-3.5 pound trigger pull, facilitating the inherent accuracy potential of this carbine. A master riflesmith then carefully assembles and fits the rifle with what we consider the finest barrel in the industry. The result is a tactical rifle that you can stake your life on; one guaranteed to shoot 1 MOA at 100 yards with quality ammunition.
The same qualities that have made the UT-15 Urban Tactical rifle a favorite defensive weapon also make it an outstanding choice for a sporting rifle. Light weight, compact size, dependable performance in all weather conditions – plus extreme accuracy – assure excellence in the field.

I do hate shipping but I hate giving stuff away. I did find a frog for the bayonet.

This is an Egyptian Hakim semi-auto rifle in 8mm Mauser. It comes with the basic 10 round and a 25 round Federal Arms mag. The bore is VG+. The wood is in good solid shape and the metal has some wear but most of bluing. This has a huge muzzle brake so recoil is negligible. (It is also really loud!) It is accurate for milsurp and a fun plinker.

The bayonet has a scabbard and the blade is good. It has been sharpened. It is missing the bayonet catch nut but the the catch screw & spring are included.

There is a gas adjustment tool included and a Garand sling.

The ammo is 45 rounds of 1970 FNM on stripper clips and about 80 rounds marked 83 * 8x57JS. I have fired both of these is the Hakim and they have worked fine.

I regard the high cap mag as more of a backup. This rifle is best fed through stripper clips. It just looks very cool – like what an AK wants to be when it grows up.

The asking price is based on the bayonet and big mag which are hard to find nowadays.

These guns were reworked from M.1943 Mauser rifles, and this one is accordingly stamped on the receiver, ""Fabrica De Armas La Coruna 1955"". The receiver displays a slightly fading Spanish crest. FR-8 was used for practice by Spanish soldiers before they were issued CETME assault rifles. The rifle has a fake gas tube installed under the barrel, to make it look like the CETME rifle. This fake gas tube is actually a cleaning kit container (the cleaning kit is not included). This gun has stronger, 1898-type action than FR-7, which was build on 1893-type action. Straight bolt handle. Stock with pistol grip. The stock does not display any markings. All matching serial numbers (the matching serial numbers are stamped on the receiver, barrel and on the bolt only; all the remaining parts do not display any numbers, which is correct for this model). No provision for the cleaning rod. CONDITION: Excellent, as rebuilt by Spanish arsenal. Most of phosphate finish is still on metal. Very nice stock has been filled in two places. Excellent bore with strong and shiny rifling. Strong action. All the internal parts of the rifle are in excellent condition, with little visible wear. Mechanically, the rifle is in great condition.

Accurate 2230 is a fast burning, double-base, spherical rifle propellant. This versatile powder was designed around the 223 Remington, but can be used in many small and medium caliber cartridges including the 308 Winchester. 2230 also works well in big bore straight wall cartridges such as the 458 Winchester.  The excellent flow characteristics and grain size of 2230 make it ideal for progressive loading. Made in Belgium."

This rifle was made by the same manufacturers who made for the Rifles for the Television Series Sharpe's Rifles. This Rifle is unfired and in new condition.

This is a beautiful replica of this famous rifle.  The rifle corps of the British Army, along with a number of other foreign armies financed by Great Britain, used the Baker Rifle throughout the Napoleonic Wars. In North America, the rifle companies of the 60th Regiment used the Baker Rifle during the invasion of Maine in 1814.  The famous 95th Rifles used them at New Orleans in 1815.   

The vent is not drilled from the pan into the barrel yet, but any gunsmith can do this. The frizzen is case hardened to produce good sparks. The seamless tempered barrel is made of high-carbon steel (type:BS970 no.080M40) and the breech is threaded. The barrel is not rifled (.62 Cal). 

Originally bought from MilitaryHeritage.com in Canada.

I could go into some history on the ""Colt Sauer"" but if you've read this far you probably already know something of the scarcity and history of these fine, hand crafted rifles. They were made from 1973 to 1985 for Colt Firearms by the master German gun maker, Sauer. They are considered to be amoung the smoothest and finest bolt action rifle ever made. This is a beautiful example of a fine and very collectable firearm. I will sell this Colt Sauer for $1500 without the Leupold Scope - $1650 with the scope. I WILL NOT SHIP.

You obviously can't believe everything someone says but this thing looks new besides some handling marks which aren't very noticeable at all. Only thing really worth mentioning is the mark right below the slide release.

The gun functioned 100%, has a great trigger but only have one issue which isn't the gun's fault. My hands are so dang small for a man that I can't actuate the slide release while in the ready to fire position. Shame because this is a lot of firepower in a small package!

1. M91/30, Izhevsk, 1943. Bore is good, no pitting and not counterbored. All numbers matching. Cosmoline has been cleaned, but the original finish is still intact.

2. M91/30, Izhevsk, 1939. Bore is good with no pitting, counterbored. I'm not exactly sure what is up with this rifle, it has characteristics of a Finn captured rifle, but it is not marked. Numbers electropenciled to match with lots of older parts including the one piece ejector spring/feed interrupter and serial numbered cocking knob. Bluing is really nice, unlike the wartime and refurb ones. Stock has a few arsenal patches. I refinished the stock years ago in a really nice military type BLO finish, looks much better than the Russian shellac. This might be a fairly valuable rifle, but I don't have the time to do the research. Comes with cleaning rod, bayonet, cleaning pouch with all tools, oil bottle, ammo pouch and sling.

nice to see you are back messing with people. the guy who has the mak-90
listed does indeed have a rare ak-47. it is a milled mak-90 and they only
imported them for one year and in a very limited number.
 norinco arms at the time was still a manufacturer of military arms and got
busted for selling illegal arms in the usa. therefore the government banned the
sale after prosecuting them.
 i have seen these go for anywhere from 950.00 up to 2000.00 at one time
now if you new what you were talking about it would be one thing. unfortunately
you dont.

It would make a great shooter!  It was sent back to the factory several years ago (before I aquired it) and had the safety conversion done, as well as having a brand new 4 5/8"" barrel put on.  If you want a nearly antique Ruger 3 screw that isn't too expensive to shoot, this might be the one.  There is only the slightest bit of ""box wear"" on the sharp back edge of the recoild shield and a tiny bit of high edge wear on the outside-front edge of the ejector rod.
