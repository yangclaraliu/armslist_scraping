It's a great rifle and I don't want to get rid of it but I bought it for my wife and she doesn't want it.

Most don't know but ATI lowers are multi cal and meet military specs. Meaning, it can be married with a 556/223 upper when you're ready (Smith and Wesson M&P 15-22 can't do this). This gun is a great starter platform for an AR15 and can be tricked out with military spec parts, such as MagPul.

You can shoot, train and have fun with the 22lr upper, and then get a 556 upper and have a serious rifle.

I will only sell to Oklahoma residents who are at least 21 years old and who are legal to own this rifle.

It is brand new, never been fired. Comes with hard case, one black 30 round PMAG. It was purchased in mid-December. Anderson makes high end AR's with a metal treatment (RF-85) that does not require oil or cleaning solvents to maintain (Unless you want to use them) The treatment reduces friction by 85% compared to a non-treated oiled weapon. This also has the result of allowing the rifle to cycle faster. The fit and finish on the rifle is comparable to Rock River and other higher end ARs. This isn't a home built ""Frankenstein"" rifle that you've been seeing on here lately.  Details from manufacturer are below. http://www.andersonrifles.net/

Must be legal to own, no bad guys. Asking $1,750.00 CASH (MSRP before the shortage and panic buying was $1450)(can also do partial cash/credit card). Need to see ID for credit card transactions.

As far as the ban is concerned, who knows? I think mag restrictions are coming, maybe a assault rifle ban, maybe even a national registry of all fireams you own. One thing is for sure something is coming its not a question of IF, its just a question of when and what

Good luck to everybody if you are not a member of the NRA become one, we are ALL in for a fight

From the research I have done, these were most popular in the late 60's and early 70's.  The barrel appears to be an original 2-groove Long Branch military barrel which was reworked to give it a nice sporter taper.  Unlike a vast majority of Enfields, the bore on this one is smooth and bright; it does not appear to have been fired much at all.  It is exactly as it was when I purchased it ~6 years ago.  Comes with 24 rounds of ammo, and 15 pieces of once-fired brass (I lost one piece somewhere).  Would make someone an excellent deer rifle at a very low price compared to even the newest cheap plastic rifles.

These are backordered for over a year, and that's if you'll still be able to buy them.

Face-to-face transaction. No paperwork. Must be legal to own.

The Burris MTAC and red dot have only been professionally mounted and bore sighted--If the rifle sells, i'll take them off. They do not come with the rifle. Again, it is unfired.

Right now i'm taking offers--the best offer gets the gun. I'll entertain trades of all sorts of firearms, so long as they're quality. Shotguns, pistols, bolt-action or semi-auto firearms, etc. Offer away."

It has spent nearly its entire life in my safe and needs a new owner who will utilize it.

The light is in perfect shape and used very very minimally, just enough to test and briefly play around with.  It mounts on the rail of 3rd and 4th gen Glocks.  It comes with everything as a new one, including the case, instructions, and spare bulb.  Per Glock's website, ""The high-resistant GLOCK polymer casing holds Xenon-technology electronics packing high luminous power, available at the touch of the ergonomically-placed ""Soft Switch"". 60 lumens.""

One Glock 19, gen 3, with 225 rounds fired through it.  For perspective, it is common for Glocks to fire 30,000 to 50,000 rounds before needing any kind of minor part replacement.   Anyway, this was my CHL friend and ensured my safety for a couple of years.  I am transitioning to a different model and want this excellent pistol to be someone else's friend now.  

What is included:
nearly new Glock 19 pistol
night sights (tritium)
IWB holster (Desantis)
two (2) factory Glock magazines
pistol lock & keys

I also have a 31 round Glock magazine that can be added to the deal for a bit more on the price.  Up to you.  Most folk are selling them for at least $50 each right now. 

If you are new to firearms, I am also willing to show you how to take apart this Glock and put it back together again.  Since Glocks mostly share the same basic design, this will enable you to disassemble and reassemble nearly any of them with ease.  I want a buyer to be comfortable with their purchase, and knowing how to strip the weapon and clean it is important.

Preference given to buyers who live in Ohio.  If you have any questions, please feel free to send them my way."

 In all this is one of the best out of the box AR-15s available. Various police forces use them due to their reliability and performance, but the quality and fit of the Colt can't be matched.

This maybe your last chance to ever get one this nice; new in the box!

-Glock 20SF. I'd like it to have at least two 15 round mags and be in good condition. A case would also be needed (since glock has nice cases). And some ammo would make the deal perfect.

.357 Magnum Snub Nose Revolver. Looking for an ankle carry gun. Black. Nothing special.. functional and in fair condition. Again ammo would be a plus.

.308 Bolt Action. Scoped. Bipod. Looking to start long range shooting. A sling would also be nice.. of course some ammo would also be a plus. A fairly nice long range scope. not picky on make or model..just tell me what you've got.

Now, these aren't AR-15's, I'm not a panic buyer, and I'm from a small town where I can still actually get stuff from the local Fleet/Farm. So I'm looking to buy these USED for a USED price. So just keep that in mind..I'm open minded though so just tell me what you have.

Thanks very much for your time,

p.s.
Also looking for exactly THREE steel mil spec 30 round ak mags, 1 box of wolf HP ammo (the box with the wolf on it, not WPA or Mil. Classic boxes) I have 480 rounds that I got for $130 so I'm just looking to complete the case (or if you have more so I can fill my mags I'd be interested as well). Also desperately seeking a cleaning rod and cleaning kit for my WASR (mine came with 2 mags instead of the fun accessories) so if you have those or any other wasr goodies I'd be more than happy to hear what you've got.

also, 1911 accessories (mags, shoulder holster, cleaning stuff), .45ACP ammo. 12 gauge ammo. Slings, optics, etc. etc.. just hit me up, we'll work out a deal for the main stuff, and figure out deal sweeteners after that..

1 10 round factory magazine
BSA red dot and mount (not shown in pictures)
Ruger sling (not shown in pictures)

I've never had a problem out of the rifle or magazines.  It's in great shape and you must see it to truly appreciate the rifle.  The high capacity magazines are a lot of fun.  The HR3C magazines store 20 additional rounds in the magazine that can be input via a stripper clip to where reloading is done in a matter of seconds.  No more sore fingers from loading the magazines (at least with these, not so much with the factory or Eagle mag).  The Eagle magazine is an older one that doesn't have the problems the newer ones have.  The factory magazine is great too.  It really follows the lines of the rifle and is good for when you are hunting and don't want a banana magazine sticking out.    

All in all, this is a great rifle and good deal.  I would not hesistate to buy this rifle and magazines to introduce new shooters to the sport or for someone looking to do some plinking / hunting.  With this being an older 10/22 (better quality components), stainless, the value of the magazines and the red dot I feel $500 is a fair price for this rifle.  Sure, you can get a lesser 10/22 cheaper, but you will be getting a blued barrel and plastic components."

Colt's new SP6920MP-B shares many features of its combat proven brother, the Colt M4. The heart of this new carbine is its 16.1 chrome lined barrel.

Magpul MOE handguards, MOE carbine stock, MOE pistol grip, MOE vertical grip and a Magpul Back-up Sight all come as standard equipment on this exceptional carbine.

The upper is built off of CMMG's standard forged A3 receiver with M4 feed ramps. The chrome plated gas piston is mounted in a solid one piece steel gas block attached to the barrel by pins. The Gas Block's 1913 Piccatinny rail is receiver height and requires a front sight designed to be mounted on the same plane as the rear sight. The dedicated, piston specific, anti-tilt bolt carrier is one piece, machined with the piston impingement key(not a bolt on). The carrier uses CMMG's standard Mil-Spec bolt. The barrel is 4140 steel, M4 profile, 5.56mm chamber and bore, 1:9 twist ratio and 1/2x28 threaded barrel. The upper is finished with M4 handguard caps, M4 handguards and an A2 flash hider installed with a crush washer. The piston gas block has a gas shut off setting for use with a suppressor to allow for maximum noise reduction. This upper was fired approximately 300 rounds. There are signs of wear where the bolt carrier rubs against the inside of the receiver. Strictly cosmetic only and does not affect the function of the rifle. This item DOES NOT require an FFL. I will not sell to california or other prohibited states."

I will not ship or drive to meet someone outside of my general area , and you must have a valid Wisconsin ID.

    Moly-coating reduces wear on your barrel and enhances velocity and accuracy.  The profile of these projectiles delivers low drag and flat trajectories.  They are built with a swaged lead core which provides uniformity and consistency and is very accurate when conducting long range shooting.

If you can show your CWP or WAC, then no paperwork is needed.  

It has the set-screw mod for the rear take down pin.  This makes it so you can change stocks without having the spring and detent fly out and lose it.  

I'm unsure of the trigger kit brand, but I paid $180.

Buffer retainer and spring are included.

The trigger guard is Fiji-Blue metallic car paint.  Very durable and adds a nice flare.
