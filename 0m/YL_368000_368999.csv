This model is not made anymore as far as I know.  Too heavy for me to carry and too beautiful for a range gun.  Need room in safe and money for projects.

Gun has polished sides, jeweled (swirled) metalwork on bushing, mag release, hammer, grip safety, exposed barrell, and trigger.  Has extended ambi safety, novak style sights, and skeletonized trigger and hammer.  Does not look tacky or like a Bling piece.  

The total effect is tasteful and unique.  You will not find another like it.  It will really turn heads.  I wore it open carry to a swap meet one time and had numerous offers for cash that I should have taken but the gun was still new to me.

Gun shoots great.  It is reliable and accurate.  It shows very little wear (less than 500 rounds).  Trigger has been worked and breaks clean.  Comes with 4 grips (wood, black rubber, hogue wraparound, and black pearl), and 3 mags.  There is a a light idiot scratch on it, but otherwise it is nearly perfect.

Make me an offer.  I have $650 invested in this gun and I don't think I need to lose money, but we will see what offers I get.  Please no lo-ballers."

*  Yes, I am aware that there are ambidextrous safeties for 1911's.  I've tried them of several 1911's and just never felt confident with them.  They always have had a bit of play in them that I didn't care for.  As such, I'm letting my last 1911 go."

The XDS is available with a standard thread mount that replaces the 1/2-28 flash hider  Like its big brother, the LRT (7.62mm), the XDS has proven itself by improving the host weapons accuracy by dampening barrel harmonics.

The entrance cap has been laser welded to the main tube body but the exit end cap can be removed so the unit can be disassembled for cleaning.

It has the Crimson Trace Grip laser, original grip, 2 speed loaders, and a Galco concealment holster. All of this new was about $1,300 (I'll include the receipts if I can find them) Ammo must ship seperately so shipping reflects two packages one for the gun to your FFL, and ammo straight to you. And please don't waste my time offering something dumb. The ammo alone is $200 and I paid $299 for the laser grip.

This is a 1967 manufactured rifle in great condition. There are some minor wear marks on the receiver and the wood does show some handling amrks/wear.
This rifle comes with a 4-Power Bushnell scope mounted on see-through rings. This will make a wonderful brush gun as you can use the open sights or scope. It handles well and is a wonderful gun.
The RC models with Saddle-Rings are extremely rare. You just do not see these very often. I saw two a the big Wanimacher show last weekend priced at $550 and $575 with no scopes.
The listed price is for a cash sale & I do prefer cash. I would consider a trade/partial trade if the deal was right, but no junk guns please. 
The only firearms I am really interested in right now are Ruger or S&W 22 revolvers or Colt/Umerich 22 (M-4) rifles. Possibly a 22 Mag lever gun.

This is what Field and Stream had to say about this gun. ""This is not a handsome rifle or a paragon of the rifle-maker’s art. It’s consistent with Savage’s philosophy of spending its time and effort on whatever will improve accuracy and not worrying a hell of a lot about looks. If I stuck with the best-shooting load for this rifle I would have a .500-inch gun. If I went to a custom smith with $3,000 I might get a rifle that would do .400, or even .350. Might. For an off-the-shelf factory rifle to shoot the way this one does, and for under $1,000, is nothing short of fantastic.""

This pistol is from one of the first production runs out of FN after Liege was liberated from the Germans, assembled from parts produced under German occupation but with all Liege/Allied markings (no German stamping of any sort).

After speaking with someone from FN, more information has come to light about this particular Hi Power as to the origin dates. Based on the serial number, it was probably produced in late '44 or early '45. Smooth top slide, no rib, GI sights. Serial number is A60xx -- four digit with A series prefix.

As I understand it from someone who is a euro gun expert, not me, the slide was an arsenal replacement at some point later on which is why it includes an external extractor. It was then used by the Austrian police service or Austrian military police (If I recall correctly from the roll marks).

I'm in no hurry to sell this as I don't really need the money, this is just for my fun fund. I picked this up from Todd at FF&F a few years back and just never rotate it into carry or really shoot it at shoots. As we all know, I don't keep guns I don't regularly (or at least semi-regularly) shoot.

Includes one serial number matching 13rd FN (extremely rare type magazine with split tongue baseplate), two non-matching 13rd FN OEM mags, and two 15rd MecGar mags, Spegel style grips and original WWII grips, Israeli 1911 holster modified to fit the Hi Power, and a Hunter leather holster that fits it rather well."

When I bought this I was told it was from Spike's Tactical. It has a keyhole forging mark. 

This upper was milled slightly out of specs, but enough to keep it from dropping into a lower properly. Two parts of this receiver have been sanded to allow a proper fit. The rear of the receiver has been sanded, and the front pin lug has been sanded. Both areas have been painted black. 

This upper now fits fine into a lower. I have pinned it to a Spike's Lower and an Aero lower with no problems. Obviously the sanded and repainted areas do not show on the exterior so aesthetically this upper lacks nothing. 

I had an experienced individual look at it, and I was told it was good to go. 

The reason I am not keeping it is because I have another stripper upper with a laser engraved graphic that I like better. 

This upper receiver has never been fired. 

70$ is my price and I am firm on it. If you want me to ship it add 5$. Otherwise FTF in Salem/PDX locale takes it for 70$. 

I will entertain trade offers for AR 15 accessories (Magpul gear, gas block)  Glock Night Sights, Red Dot Sight, or Free Float Rail for DPMS AR 10."

The only reason I am selling this lower is because I had a custom lower on backorder from Spikes for my .50 Beowulf, after waiting nearly 2 months I got tired of the wait game and bought this one, the very day the YHM lower got to my FFL, I got a call from Spikes letting me know my order was ready and had been shipped, go figure.  As I stated this lower is unused brand new and I am listing it for less than I paid for it (lower is 379.99 plus the shipping and the ffl transfer fee) you won't be able to buy this lower for this price alone, and on top of that you have the shipping and ffl transfer fee to figure in, my loss is really your gain. As for trades I would be interested in a semi-auto handgun (nothing smaller then 9mm) Or really anything else interesting to add to the collection. Anyone in this market knows that ""good"" lowers are getting hard to come by, everyone has a long lead time right now. Here's your chance to beat the rush and get your build started.

As I stated this lower is unused brand new and I am listing it for less than I paid for it (lower is 379.99 plus the shipping and the ffl transfer fee) you won't be able to buy this lower for this price alone, and on top of that you have the shipping and ffl transfer fee to figure in, my loss is really your gain.
