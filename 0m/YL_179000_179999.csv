Brief History of The M1917 Enfield 


   As the United States prepared for European conflict at the onset of The Great War, it found itself short of the necessary quantity of service rifles of the then current issue model, the M1903 Springfield. The firms of Remington, Winchester, and the Remington subsidiary Eddystone Arsenal, had just completed contracts for the production of .280 Rimless M1914 Enfield's for Great Britain. With government arsenals producing the M1903 Springfield at top capacity and still behind in supplying demand, it was determined that with minor modification required to utilize the .30 caliber U.S. service cartridge Model of 1906, the same tooling could be used to produce the needed quantity of rifles. Thus was born the M1917 Enfield. 
   The M1917 found itself in the hands of more Doughboys during The Great War than the Springfield, including the famous Alvin C. York, who during the battle of the Argonne Forrest, ultimately won the U.S. Congressional Medal of Honor for employing his M1917 with deadly effect in wiping out a hornets nest of German machinegun posts and capturing 
132 enemy soldiers, including 3 officers, virtually single-handedly. The M1917, though slightly heavier and sometimes considered a bit unwieldy compared to the M1903, was nonetheless, durable, rugged, and extremely reliable. The aforementioned feats accomplished by Sergeant York attest to its accuracy potential in capable hands. 

   At the conclusion of World War I, the M1917 was retired from active duty in favor of the well entrenched M1903. As clouds of war began developing at the onset of WWII, many M1917's were again called out to be issued for training, reserve usage, and foreign aid. Prior to this activity, most were re-barreled and refurbished by contracted armories, including the firm of Johnson Automatics. This, combined with the propensity to take military bolt action rifles and alter them to sporting configuration for hunting, makes original, unaltered M1917's extremely scarce and highly desirable."

It will run everything from 2 3/4"" birdshot to 3"" magnum loads. Saiga 12 model IZ-109 with 19 inch barrel. This is not your typical ""kitchen table"" conversion that you see for sale everyday. This also does not just use a simple $50.00 bolt-on pistol grip and stock. This is a real deal conversion where the trigger is moved forward and it is worth every penny. This is also an original Russian American Armory imported Saiga 12. The importer markings have not been etched out, as seen with more recent imports. I don't want to sell it, but bills and car repairs are forcing me to.

Future Saiga 12 imports will not include the scope mount on the side due to new ATF restrictions. This does include the side mount for using scopes, red dot rights, etc.

Chrome lined barrel. The bore is bright and shiny. This weapon has been taken care of and maintained by me. I am the original owner.

** DRUM IS INCLUDED **

Here is a list of some modifications that were performed on this Saiga 12:

- Rear tang removed and internal stock adapter added for custom aluminum skeleton stock.
A folding mechanism can easily be added for about $60.00, I just chose not to add one. Solid aluminum skeleton stock uses slip-on AR15 recoil pads. Recoil pad is also included as pictured.

- G2 Double Hook Trigger
For added reliability, the extra notch was added to receiver to accommodate the double hook trigger.

- Aftermarket gas plug installed.
Hand adjustable, no tool needed to press the pin to turn it. Allows you to easily tune the gas setting depending on the shells used. 5 settings vs. the 2 settings on the factory gas plug.

- Standard AK pistol grip nut used for mounting the pistol grip.
Most conversions use a cheap trigger guard that the pistol grip bolts onto. This method is NOT secure. My Saiga 12 uses a standard AK pistol grip nut with a pistol grip hole cut in the receiver, just like standard AK's, for a far more secure grip.


Also included:
 - Cleaning rod
 - Cleaning kit
 - Oil bottle
 - Factory muzzle nut wrench
 - 5 round magazine
 - 20 round drum


I am asking $1,100.00 (firm) with the MD Arms 20 round drum. $1,000.00 without the drum. Contact me via email with any questions.

If you are an out-of-state buyer, I will ship this Saiga 12 to a local dealer in your area for an additional $45.00 once I have verified their FFL number.

Thanks for looking.

Rifle features:
The heavy-contoured, hammer forged barrel is fitted with a flash suppressor / muzzle brake to provide greater accuracy with reduced muzzle signature. Both the barrel and the receiver feature a black oxide finish to eliminate glare. The short, smooth 60 degree bolt throw allows for rapid operation and, like the safety release, the bolt action is quiet. A massive six-lug lockup system is used to give the SSG 3000 greater strength and accuracy, while the lightweight firing pin means an extremely short lock time in the range of 3 milliseconds. The steel receiver and bolt are both precision-machined to exact tolerances. The bolt locks directly into the chamber, eliminating headspace concerns. The ergonomic qualities of the SSG 3000 are also exceptional. The tough McMillan composite stock is designed to put the user in a natural shooting position that facilitates comfort and concentration over long periods of time without fatigue or distraction. The SSG 3000 is designed with a comfortable pistol grip and fully adjustable stock to give the shooter a custom fit. The trigger is adjustable for trigger position, trigger take up, let-off point, and trigger pull weight. The receiver on the SSG 3000 features a dovetail that will accept a wide range of sighting systems, including a factory available M1913 rail. The SSG 3000’s modular design not only provides ease of maintenance, but also the ability of the end user to easily replace the barrel eliminating costly gunsmithing expenses.

Here we have an Iver Johnson break-top 5-shot revolver in 32 S&W. This one is a 3rd model made between 1915 and 1926, so it's OK for smokeless powder. Grips have a little piece missing near the bottom, but they fit in the hand fine. Cylinder advance is a bit sloppy, as it tends to be on these old lemon squeezers, but but it seems to lock up in the right spot. It fires fine and I haven't noticed it shaving any lead. Would make a nice wax bullet belly gun for CAS, having that mini-Schofield look. It's a fun little piece, but I gotta make some space. 

Cash and face to face only, and have your WI driver's license with you. Would consider a trade for a pistol in 22LR."

I'd like to find either an 18.5"" cylinder bore already set up for HD or a used longer barrel that I could cut down to 18.5"". I would prefer a true Wingmaster barrel, with the high-lustre bluing, rather than a matte-finish 870 Express barrel. 

Obviously, I'll pay more for one that's already set up for HD, but if the price is low enough on the longer barrel, I'd be more than happy to consider it. Don't need a 3"" chamber; don't need a vent rib; don't need one with bulges, rust, or pitting inside or out.

So, if you've got an old plain jane Wingmaster barrel gathering dust in your safe, let me know what you'd like for it. Please keep in mind that I can buy a Wingmaster HD barrel factory-fresh for $132 shipped to my door.

I have for sale, a hardly shot (less than 500 rounds) Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22.

The rifle was $449 new plus tax, plus $20 each for the additional magazines.  I have $500 in the gun and mags.

This is the AR-15 style 22lr that shoots 25 rounds. This gun is in fantastic condition, I have never had any issues with it. 

It comes in the original box. I am looking for the paperwork that came with it but at the time of this posting I could not locate it. If I find it by the time you purchase the rifle, I will of course include it.

Normally this rifle comes from the store with 1 magazine, but as you can see in the picture the rifle comes with 3 magazines. Trust me, with this rifle you can never have enough magazines!!!!

This gun was bought locally in Fuquay and has been in my possession for about 3 months. 

It comes bone stock, except the 2 additional magazines which cost around $25 per depending on who you buy from.

I took this gun out last week and it fired flawlessly. Once you load the magazines properly (Ill show you) you will have no problems. I havent had a FTE or FTF since the first day, and those were my fault..

I just cleaned and oiled this gun 5 minutes before posting this, so it is ready to rock. 

I will also throw in a couple hundred rounds of 22 ammo, which is $18 for 500 rounds. 

The only reason I am selling this gun is I want to buy a true zombie killer, a AR-15.

The gun is not sighted in. I had a scope on it and just put the stock sites on for the purpose of selling.

There are a couple of rules for buying that are not negotiable.

They are:

You are not a felon
Sign a bill of sale
A valid NC drivers license.

Prefer to meet locally"

It also has factory GLOCK night sights that are nice and bright.  This is a great little pocket freight train and I love this little gun.  Only gripe is it's a little small for my big ole' fat @SS hands.  So I would be willing to trade this for either a Glock 30 or a 29 straight up.  Or am interested in M&P's in either .40 or .45acp.  Would like it to have night sights also but not a deal breaker if it's in excellent shape like this one.  Or if you just want to buy...I will take $500 cash.  No box.  The original owner contacted me wanting to buy it back when he sells one of his guns, so if I don't sell by this weekend I'll just pull the ad and hold for him or I will just keep it.

It is in pretty good condition for its age. It shoots the 45/70 ammo. It appears to be all factory. I cant see anything on the gun that someone has tried to refinish. It says US Springfield on the side of the rifle and it says US MODEL 1884 on the receiver right behind the rear sight. It is really hard to see it but it is there. The bluing is all still there. The wood is in good shape. The cleaning rod is there. The bore is nice. It has 2 barrel rings. I have never fired the rifle but it looks like there would be no problems. The hammer cocks back nicely and it releases fine. This rifle is a great piece of american history and would be a great piece for someones collection. I am looking to trade for a nice carry pistol. Im looking for a colt defender or a kimber ultra carry 2. Let me know what you have and lets see if we can work out some sort of a deal.

So here it is. A Red Jacket custom - Ak-47 with all MP5 furniture and Mp5 sights perfectly grafted onto this AK receiver. Custom gas system, flash hider, and 1 point sling on the back.

It's perfect and runs perfect as well. I actually shot this at the Red Jacket birthday bash and Discover channel has footage of me with it. Don't know if that is ever going to make it into an episode.

This is not a cheap Draco or anything like that. It's a quality piece and you will have no trouble with it. I've put maybe 150 rounds through it.

I can't find what one of these would sell for - but I am looking at $750 or best offer. Or maybe something I don't have and some cash.

According to the Ruger web site, this was made in 1993. I'm not sure, but I have seen comments online stating that they only made these in 9mm for 1 year, so they're pretty rare.

It's a five shot revolver that uses full moon clips (10 included).

The Trigger guard latch spring and hammer spring have been replaced to lighten up the trigger pull and it is very crisp now. I have the stock springs that are still in good condition if you want to return it back to stock.

Included with the revolver are 10 full moon clips, hogue grip (installed), stock grip (in box), Uncle Mikes inside the pants holster and a package containing the stock and extra springs.

I never carried this and only shot it a few times, with less than 200 rounds through it since I have owned it. It's in excellent condition, with the only imperfection being some slight scuffing on the left side by the grip.

I asking $500 and am firm on that price.
Buyer will need to show me a MN id and permit to purchase or permit to carry. I will also require you to sign a bill of sale."

Research done on this particular model shows it as being either an ex Dragoon with arsenal updates or an early prototype 91/30.  

  The rifle is in extremely good shape.  The stock has been refinished in red mahogany with a satin finish clear.  Bore is very shiny; no pitting, no rust anywhere.  Trigger was shimmed to improve pull geometry and crispness.  Bolt has been buffed out and action is smooth like butter (well, for a Mosin).

  Comes with sling, two ammo pouches, takedown/headspace tool, cleaning kit, bayonet, and oil bottle with free cosmoline.  

  As far as trades, anything goes, including 7.62x39 ammo, MREs, or especially beat up military rifles in shootable/restorable condition.  I can add cash for the right weapon.  Just surprise me...no hunting rifles, please.

  Will meet FTF in the Concord/Charlotte are for any transaction.

  For cash, just make a reasonable offer.  Mosins are not rare by any stretch of the imagination, but, it's not every day you find a hex receiver this old and in immaculate shape.  I need the money for other restoration projects, so I need it gone... 

  Thanks."

I want to buy your Old, Rusty, Broken or Fire Damaged Winchester Rifle - Parts missing = OK. Broken, Does Not Work = OK Model, year not important. Older, the better! If you have a project that you will ""get to one day"" and haven't - I want to buy it. I'll use the parts to make another Winchester almost new again! In the medical field you could say that I do ""transplants"" to patients needing a new heart, lung or such. Your old Winchester will live again but in another body. Go now, to the fartherest corner of your shop and dig out that old, tired soldier and send it to me. I'll prepare it for surgery.
You'll be surprised how much I'll pay for it!!
