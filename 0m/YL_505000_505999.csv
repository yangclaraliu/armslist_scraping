Also one of the sight adjustment caps on the scope got lost.  I bought it for my little brother to have and get familiar with, I let him take it to his fathers for the summer since his father says he ""knows guns"" and it came back as it is now.  Im selling it mainly because I was going to get something with a bigger caliber since hes getting bigger now.  Took it out to the range over the weekend, its in great working condition and is still very accurate (shooting penny size groupings easily).  Comes with an already mounted and sighted scope, 3 magazines, a Gander Mountain soft carrying case, some left over rounds, and some earplugs (the rounds and earplugs were in the case so why not).  I will even throw in the sling that I bought for it but never got around to putting it on the rifle.  selling for 150$ OBO.  You can contact me at REDACTED anytime after noon.

Below is a brief description from the Sig website:

SIG recently released the SIG P522, a pistol version of the SIG 522 rifle.

Both function great and are in good working condition. 

The ATI stock had some inner webbing removed so the stock could fully fold over the top of the shotgun that had MMC ghostrings sights installed. Without removing the inner webbing, the stock would not completely fold over. Not too pretty, but it functions perfect. 

The stock has a sling adapter ring and optional shell saddle mounting holes.
I only have the adapter, screw, and washer for the Remington 870 12/20 gauge. Might fit more models, i'm not sure. 

The Surefire foregrip is branded LPC (Laser Products Corp.) That was Surefire before they became popular. This is the orginal design and probably one of the first forend weapon lights made, somewhat of an antique. Has a touch-sensitive pad that functions great but is starting to show signs of weathering. It has a Surefire P60 bulb which is rated for 65 lumens. The bulb can be upgraded to a variety of bulbs on the market such as LED high intensity, 120 lumen, etc bulbs.The foregrip comes with 2 Surefire CR123 batteries installed.

One is a BRAND NEW Rock River Entry Tactical; NIB, Never Fired! It is an M4 configuration,1:9 twist, chrome-lined barrel, two-stage trigger, chambered for .223 or NATO 5.56, 6 position collapsable stock, Hogue grips, Tactical Rear sight, bayonet lug, birdcage suppressor and tactical sling mounts. Comes with aluminum 30rd. magazine and hard carrying case. I purchased this rifle during the '08/'09 craze and paid $1200. Now that the assault rifle debate is at a lull, I'm willing to take a loss and sell it at comparable prices. I've never had the pleasure of firing this rifle, but I'm sure it will make a great addition to your collection. The Second rifle was put together with a lot of TLC. A law-enforcement friend told me about a company called Essential Arms out of Louisiana. I bought the A2 upper and the lower from Essential Arms and was TRULY amazed at the quality. Anyone who knows what some knock-off machined AR uppers and lowers can look like will be truly impressed. Essential Arms has gone the extra mile to make sure their product is way above industry standards. My son and I put this rifle together as a project. It is an A2 model, 20"" chrome-lined pencil-type colt barrel (the barrel was purchased from a seller who owned a skid of colt barrels that were still in the original packaging), new bolt (we think it was a colt bolt from the markings, but we couldn't verify that as a fact), it has a DPMS parts kit, birdcage suppressor, bayonet lug, forward assist. This rifle only has 100 rounds through it. When finished, we took it to the range and tested it and it fires very true. This auction is for BOTH rifles; RR-Entry Tactical M4 and Essential Arms AR-15A2. Winner also receives a black cordura padded rifle case along with FIVE MagPul magazines. Buyer pays $50 shipping which includes both rifles. If costs are over $50, I will pay the difference. If shipping is under $50, I will return the difference to buyer. BUYER MUST send copy of FFL along with Money Order Payment with FFL address."

It's old, I'd say a gunsmith special or someone who wants to learn, use it for parts... I don't know. Looks like someone tried to fix the spring with JB Weld. 

It will cock and advance the cylinder and drop the hammer when trigger is pulled. I have not shot it personally. 

Asking $50.00 OBO or will trade for:
* Couple of boxes of 45 ACP or Federal bulk 22lr ammo
* GSG accesories - scope, stocks, tactical grips, tactical cases, etc. etc.
* Leg drop tactical holster for full size 45

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look.

12 gauge made by High Standard and sold by Sears as a JC Higgins. High Standard called it there RIOT GUN model. It is a 20 inch barrel. Someone before me paid a gunsmith to thread the inside of the barrel for choke tubes. They did a very nice job. It comes with 3 choke tubes and since there is no trigger reset you can slamfire this model just like the Ithica model 37. The wood on this shotgun is Very nice. It has a sort of silver inlay on the bottom of the buttstock.

Call/Text David @ REDACTED

Will accept legitimate offers but no trades.

Info on the gun below: 

The Kimber Ten is a 1911 with a frame that holds a 10 round magazine. Simple as that —the unequaled accuracy and dependability of a Kimber plus more rounds in the magazine and as few design changes as possible. A pistol you can trust.

Compare a Kimber Ten with other high capacity .45 ACP pistols, even the ones that look like a 1911. They change just about everything, starting with the trigger and safety systems. Those changes might sound good in the store but don’t necessarily prove out on the range. If you want the best .45 ACP and high capacity, you still want a Kimber.

All the Ten pistols have the custom features expected from Kimber, and the all-new polymer frame is almost identical in dimensions to a standard single stack. Kimber frame inserts are machined from the finest aluminum and steel, then molded into a polymer body. This is more expensive than machining an investment casting like other brands but the Kimber insert is more precise and lasts a lifetime.

This year, the Kimber Tactical Extractor with loaded chamber indicator feature is standard on every Ten pistol. Other features include a stainless steel slide. Both beavertail grip safety and mainspring housing are polymer.

The Pro Carry Ten II features a four-inch bushingless barrel, and is available in .45 ACP."

The rifles were made in 1986 and the SRC in 1991. They are made true to the original design with no tang safety or rebounding hammer (that causes light primer strikes) as the newer Winchester have. 

This rifle is in next to new condition with about 30 rounds through it. It was purchased from Turnbull years ago and never used. It is chambered in 45 70. They are only going up in price every year. Located in Tucson, FTF cash deal. I will consider trades. I am looking for a nice 4"" 1911, a Colt Gen 2 Walker, Lever action 12 gauge, or nice AR Upper, possible eotech with mag. Let me know what you have."

This rifle was used for 3 Rat seasons in Central Oregon. It might have as many as 500 - 600 rounds fired, and is in excellent, flawless condition.

It can also easily fire 22LR, by simply switching the barrel. All the internal parts work with either ammo.

This is a superior Varmint Shooter as the ammo above suggests. The Valquartsen carbon fiber bull barrel makes it a extremely accurate and light weight bush or field gun. The trigger is outstandingly smooth. This gun can 'reach out & touch' like you won't believe!

I'd really like to fund my new 1911 project and therefore open to a reasonable offer. All I can say is ""Yes"" or ""No'; so if the gun is of interest to you, don't be shy.
