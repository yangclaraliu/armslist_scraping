 Here is an unfired FEG AMD-65 7.62x39 Milled AK 47 THE PICTURE POSTED IS ON I GOT ONLINE, THE ONE I HAVE IS STILL HEAVILY COATED WITH COSMOLINE. THIS IS THE OLDER VERSION WITH THE MILLED RECEIVER. As you can see it has the very cool skeletonized side folding stock so it is handy for home protection or easily stored away for future use. To keep it compact it comes with 1 brand new 20 round magazine that snaps in nice and tight. There are plenty of 30 & 40 round magazines available on line. 

 I have owned several AK47s over the years and they are still the most dependable and durable weapons for SHTF situations. I am sure these rifles are the first on Hillary's list to ban. I found this in the back of the vault and decided to put it up for sale before that happens. It is my last AK47 so get one while you still have an opportunity. I can still do a face to face sale in Iowa if you show ID and shipping to an FFL in most states is about 35.00. This sale of this compliant rifle will be in accordance with state and federal laws. I can only sell to an out of state buyer through an  FFL in that state.
I do not need to sell it and it will only increase in value so the price is firm. I may also trade for a 8-10k generator. 

IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY: If you voted for a Liberal I will not sell this to you, it is obvious that you are incapable of making wise choices with firearms.

The sites are Meprolight night sites and are less than a year old...very bright. I have 4 factory 12 round magazines as well. The holster is made by Tommy Theis; horsehide and works very well. 

I'm going to ask $475 (price is negotiable) for the package but would very much like to entertain trades for a short action deer rifle (.243, 7mm/08, 308). Ideally one without sights and a not so heavy or long barrel. 

Gun does have some holster wear, but nothing that wouldn't clean up with a smidge of effort. The pictures make it look a bit worse than it is. The one black smudge was just that...a smudge. The pictures came out kind of backwards/upside down, but give you the idea. Thanks for looking and email me with interest or questions.  I'm not sure if the pics will show up or not. If not, and you would like to see some, I can email them to you.

It features the old-style, German-made carbon-steel slide with the same accuracy and balance that made the original P228 so popular. In addition it has SigLite night sights, and a tactical rail that is a standard feature on the more modern P229s

It's a Thompson Center Hawken Muzzleloader in .50 and appears to be an older model, but I can't verify that as TC has no serial number records. It has a nice piece of wood, a great trigger and the rifling looks strong. The exterior of the barrel shows some wear due to age, but it looks to have been well maintained. My knowledge of muzzleloaders is limited at best, but I will try to answer any questions I can.

Cheap Smith (shades under their M&P platform), but packs a light weight punch. Purchased the pistol in 2008, ran about six hundred rounds through with NO jam. 

Pistol comes with four magazines, original case, gun lock, case lock, owners manual, and original receipt.  

Selling because I fell in love with Sigs, and I need some extra cash around the holidays for my kids. I do not want to pawn it and would like to see it go to a great home. Would make a great starter gun, and has protected many campsites, dark nights, and fishing trips.

I started with a clean, probably never-issued, SKS, with matching numbers, then customized it by removing the grenade launcher and grenade sight, added an after-market flash hider, removed the bayonet and cleaning rod, then ground off and reblued the attaching lug.  I then added a rear scope mount with a JMT XTA Tactical 4x30 scope.  One can look through the scope base and still see the original open sights.  A correct and original sling rounds out the package.   The unused tool and cleaning kit is still present in the buttstock.

The SKS has a teak-wood stock, rubber butt pad, and a bright, shiny bore.  I will include all original parts that were removed during the customization, plus a comprehensive operation and maintenance manual.

This is one of the rifles discovered still in their original wooden crates, as shipped from the Zastava State Arsenal to the Yugoslavian military almost 50 years ago.  It is a beautifully-preserved example of classic European craftsmanship at its best.

It's a great gun, it's just time to get rid of one of my toys to buy a new one.  The sale must be a face-to-face, cash transaction.   If you see this ad, the SKS is still available.  I check my email regularly so you should receive a response the same day that you message me.

I have owned the gun for less than a year,fired 300 rounds at most though it with zero issues. 

It is virtually new,I have all the paper work,everything that came with the Ruger,plus 2 extra magazines (Ruger provides only one). They all have the finger rest extension. 

Galloway Precision preformed all the work that includes the following:

-LC9 Trigger System Upgrade ( Shortens the stroke by half the stock pull length and break at the half way point of the stock travel, all while maintaining the factory safeties)

-Stainless Steel Guiderod (replaces the stock plastic one)

-Upgraded Recoil Springs (20lbs springs vs 16lbs stock ones,Will help tame recoil and muzzle flip and handle high powered defense loads)

-Reduced Power Springs ( helps eliminate the stacking at the end of the trigger pull)

-Removed the Magazine disconnect safety (The gun still has the regular,switch safety but the mag safety wouldn't let the gun fire without a magazine in the gun,I found this extra safety unnecessary,still have the parts,many LC9 owners do this).    

The people at www.gallowayprecision.com did a great job, the difference versus the stock LC9 is huge,night and day. 
Compared to the stock trigger pull, it is now much lighter,shorter,crisper. Recoil is reduced. 

The work parts and labor cost me total $150. Also two extra magazines, for a total of 3 magazines. I am asking $450.00 for this excellent CCW firearm.  

Any interested parties contact me anytime on my cell REDACTED or email me via the post email."

More pics can be emailed if needed.





I have for trade the following;

Antique Japanese Nihonto Wakazashi sword from the Shinto Era.

Sword details;

This is an unsigned sword with an NTHK attribution to Hisamichi.

Hisamichi was a member of the Mishina School and there were several 
generations using this name. 

It is in reasonable polish there are some scuff marks on it but the details 
of the hamon and hada are clearly visible and all the detail can be seen. 

The fittings are fairly plain and in keeping with what is a quite austere and 
powerful blade (typically mishina in my experience).



Shinto Era smith's worked from around 1650 to 1800.

I would put this sword to be very early Shinto, probably around 1650 to 1700.

This sword would retail well over 3500.00 if not more, as it is made the traditional way Japanese swords were made, and no Chinese junk here, superb craftsmanship on this blade, and all of the fitting as well."

TERMS OF SALE:

Due to recent political developments, there is much talk of re-instituting an ""Assault Weapons"" ban on the federal level, and the drafts of such a ban that I've seen presented by Sen. Dianne Feinstein would even include this innocuous little hunting rifle.  Because of that, and because such plans would prohibit the future manufacture, sale, or even transfer of such guns, I suddenly don't need to sell it that badly.  Yep, you read that right.  The new AWB is looking to ban even the TRANSFER of ""AWs"", so ONLY people who currently own one will be allowed to have one after the AWB is passed. Because of that, the price is now $1000.00 cash, FIRM.  I will not consider offers of even one penny less.

*** UPDATE ***
The draft copy of Sen Feinstein's proposed AWB aims to ban the SKS and its variants BY NAME.  This gun IS on the list of banned rifles in the legislation that Sen Feinswine plans to take before Congress.  SKSs are now going for over $800 on Gunbroker.com so don't wait!  You can pick this one up TODAY and have it safely in your own home with NO PAPER TRAIL.  By the time you figure in shipping and FFL fees, you will pay the same for one of those Gunbroker rifles as you will for this one, but then you'll have to be dealing with an FFL.  Why make yourself a target for future confiscation?  By face-to-face, then nobody but you has to know that you have it.


If you want to buy this semi-auto rifle before they can pass a ban, here is what you must do:

1) Do not ask if it is still for sale. If this ad is up, it is still for sale. I will immediately delete any emails asking if it is still for sale.

2) You must be an AZ resident (or active duty military here on a PCS move, qualifying for AZ residency).  I am not a firearms dealer and I'm looking to sell this privately, face to face, from one law-abiding citizen to another.  Emails from residents of other states will be deleted immediately. No sales to CA residents, period. 

3) You must not be a ""Prohibited Posessor"" under AZ or Federal law.  I am a sworn LEO, and I will arrest you myself if you are prohibited from owning a gun and try to acquire this one.

4) Don't waste my time.  When you email me, you need to state:
   -Your name
   -Your phone number
   -That you have cash IN HAND
   -Where you want to meet (Huachuca City, Sierra Vista, or Bisbee).
   -When you want to meet, but must be after 3pm Thursday-Monday (including weekends), or anytime Tuesday or Wednesday.

5) Do not ask me to commit any illegal act.  I will not break any laws.  Requests to ""pretend"" you are an AZ resident and/or make an illegal sale and/or break any law will be immediately forwarded to State and Local law enforcement, and the BATFE for prosecution.  Ignorance of the law is no excuse.  If you are buying a firearm, you better know the laws pertaining to such a purchase, or you risk spending 10 years in Federal pound-me-in-the-butt prison.

If you can follow all of the directions above, I will call you at the number you provide and set up the details of where in town we'll be meeting.

I'm not going to chase you down to sell it to you.  At this point, every single semi-auto rifle that might be banned has already sold out of all the gun shops in AZ.  If you want to get a rifle like this before they ban it, this is probably going to be your last and only chance to get one.  The price is high, but the way things are going you won't be able to buy one at ANY price soon.  Plus, you are paying a premium for a face-to-face sale that will have NO PAPER TRAIL, just in case a future ban does not include a ""grandfather clause""."

Many airsoft MP5 accessories may also be used on the GSG-5. Magazines for the GSG-5 are available in 2-round, 10-round, 15-round, 22-round and 110-round drum configurations.

The GSG-5 utilizes the H&K style drum sight that is adjustable for windage. German Sport Guns provides a weaver rail attachment that slides onto the top of the frame, allowing other sighting systems to be added.

Really a fun gun to shoot. It comes with 5 factory GSG 22 round Magazines.That is 4 more than came with the gun. THESE MAGS ARE ABOUT $30 BUCKS EACH SO YOU ARE ACTUALLY GETTING THE GUN FOR UNDER $250. ALSO A BOX OF 500 ROUNDS"

Fires 7mm Mauser ammo. It is a short carbine with bent bolt, not a long rifle (looks just like K98). I don’t know how accurate it is, I never took it to the range, just fired few test shots (cycles and fires fine). Bluing on the barrel is gone, almost looks like polished steel. Bore looks dark but rifling is well pronounced. Receivers on these rifles never had bluing to start with. Receiver has Austrian markings and Chilean crest. There is a crack on the wood on the upper hand guard, hardly visible about 2 “ long, does not affect anything. Retaining pin on the bayonet lug thingy is missing (should be a cheap repair, or you can use a small screw), but the cap is sitting firmly and does not get loose even after few rounds fired. Rifle is all original, all numbers match, no import markings. I also have a German bayonet for K98 (blade and sheath have matching #s). Blade is in excellent condition, never was sharpened.

With all the features of the popular SR9® and the award winning SR9c™, the Ruger SR40® is possibly the easiest recoiling, smoothest shooting .40 on the market.

HIGH-VISIBILITY 3-DOT SIGHT SYSTEM: Rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable and front sight is windage adjustable.

UNIQUE REVERSIBLE BACKSTRAP (FLAT OR ARCHED) that allows shooters to quickly customize the size and feel of the grip, without the use of separate inserts or special tools.

AMBIDEXTROUS THUMB SAFETY AND D-SHAPED MAGAZINE RELEASE are easy to reach and actuate.

INTEGRAL ACCESSORY MOUNTING RAIL provides space for mounting lights, lasers and other tactical accessories.

OTHER FEATURES: Though remarkably similar in size to the popular SR9, the SR40’s custom slide design reduces recoil and slide velocity, making it more comfortable to shoot than many of its competitors."

The sight is made of high quality aircraft aluminum with crystal clear optics. Works similar to the real thing--the right button brightens the reticle, the left button darkens it. A total of 20 brightness levels. Press both buttons at the same time to turn it off and either button turns it back on. You can change the reticle from red to green using the center button. Fully adjustable for windage and elevation. It has the quick detach mount and the regular mount, too. Ideal for hunting small game and target practicing; however, if you are after bad guys here or abroad, I recommend getting the real thing. Includes a batterys and hex wrench to adjust the quick release mount. This is not a real $500 EOTech, however, if you want an eotech style sight without the hefty price tag, it is a great option.
come with scope cover and neoprene protective cover and quick disconnect locking mount.

I'm selling a 2011 ice bear road warrior trike in the richmond/norfolk area asking $$$3500$$$ OBO. Yes it's the same price as a new one but ....it has very low miles (less than 1000), highway safe rear tires and pirelli front that are new, has a recently rebuilt and tuned carb, new fuel lines with inline filter installed, new fuel pump, custom air intake to allow high flow air filter, new battery, plastic fenders cut from unibody and the edges re trimmed, new metal fenders fabricated and radiused just for the new tires, exhaust has had catalytic converters which I had cut off and extension pieces welded on to allow emgo downslash mufflers to be mounted (sounds great), kuryakyn iso grips, new mirrors, and has a free and clear title.
This trike is a great around town while looking cool kinda bike which I invested a lot of time and money (about 3k in upgrades) into for my wife. She has had good news recently and the medical issues forcing her to ride on 3 wheels instead of 2 are gone so I'm looking to pass this on to a good home. It will cruise at 60-65mph and she has been using it to run for groceries and back/forth to work. 
I am open to almost any trade offer, multiple guns, guns plus cash, ammo, optics, etc; heck...you might have something to trade I don't even know I want/need so don't hesitate to call or text me to make an offer or get more info on it. I have a trailer and can deliver and have no problems with serious people taking test rides. It is full size as you can see with my wife on it, you can see how I finished the edges when I chopped off the fenders, and my home made new fenders you can see look like they belong on it not some home hack job  Theres a lot of time love and a bit of blood in this thing and I want it going to a good home!

Looking to make room in the garage and so my wifes little 110cc dirt bike has to go. It is a really fun pit bike that can easily handle my rather large self riding it and it tons of fun. 4 speed, kick start, mint condition (might have a little mud on it but that will wash off), never dropped and starts easily. This has low hours as it was used to help my wife re-learn how to ride on 2 wheels (I'd guess less than 10 hours run time total). I paid 750$$ a few months ago and it is like new and well maintained so 500$$$ maybe a little more in trade.

I purchased this TV brand new and put it in my Cell Phone store. I took a picture without flash to show image quallity and a picture with flash to show how great of condition the whole thing is in, it still has the sticker on the front. It is LCD, HDMI and pictures of the back show all the hookups. The megapixels in the photo does not show how FANTASATIC the picture is, it has a wonderful image. I very rarely turned it on as I always had the stereo on. This TV costed $2200 and is like new in excellent condition. I MEAN REALLY GREAT CONDITION! I still have the price tag taped to the side from when I bought it. If you would like to buy with cash I will consider REASONABLE offers only. I would rather have a nice trade, something neat, nice, cool or awesome from my want list. *****I prefer if you pick this TV up,***** it is big. I would consider delivering it only if you come here and see it and seal the deal first and live close to me. I just dont wanna move this thing more than needed.
