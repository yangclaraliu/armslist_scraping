The Ruger LCR is a compact .38 Special caliber revolver built by Ruger and announced in January 2009. The LCR acronym stands for 'Lightweight Compact Revolver'. It incorporates several novel features such as a polymer grip and trigger housing,[3] monolithic receiver, and constant force trigger. At 13.5 oz (380 g),[4] the LCR is nearly 50% lighter than the stainless steel SP-101[5] and with only the barrel and fluted cylinder made of stainless steel. The frame is aluminum alloy and synthetic glass-filled polymer finished in matte black with Synergistic Hard Coat. The LCR operates in double action only (DAO) as the hammer is concealed within the frame handle's fire control housing of the gun and cannot be cocked prior to firing. It features a friction reducing cam that gives it a crisp and light trigger pull that is non-stacking, which is rarely found on double action revolvers that mechanically by nature gives it a very heavy trigger pull.

In June 2010, Ruger released two new models of the LCR. The LCR-357 is chambered for .357 Magnum rather than .38 Special. The LCR-BGXS has a Hogue smorth boot grip and a tritium dot sight.[6]r engraved cylinder and gold trimmed cylinder."

I'm also including a separate rifle case with five mag pouches. I've added on a basic holo sight (read not the best sight in the world but should last for a good 1000 rounds or so until you can get a better sight). It's a solid gun if a bit on the heavy side. The bull barrel allows for more accurate shots overall if you're into precision shooting. I will be including some loose surplus ammunition, 40 rounds of the M855 rounds, 19 surplus tracer rounds, and around 40 or so reloads. 

If you have any questions about the rifle let me know. Concealed Weapon License holders preferred. I will be asking for basic information and a signature on a bill of sale, one for me and one for you. Cash only. 

Important: Sorry, I can't ship the firearm. The case is far too large for me to actually take to a shipping location. I use a scooter year round and it's a miracle I go the rifle home the first time. I would be unable to carry it in a package or with the case. You must be willing to pick up the firearm yourself in the Provo-Orem area."

This ammo was made by Lake City in the late 1960s to mid-1970s. See ""Lake City M196"" on YouTube to see how this stuff lights. Because of the age, some rounds won't trace, but the shooting characteristics are just like any other ammo. Tracer ammo can and does start fires. Overall a good value for brass case surplus 5.56mm blasting ammo, great for volume shooters who use ranges where fire risk is minimal and a ton of fun.  The photos are stock photos identical to the box you'll buy.  The ammo can is sealed.

This is a serious rifle for serious people.  Please don't get angry at me because you can't afford it.  I am posting a picture of what an HBAR looks like but will not be posting any pictures of my rifle.  I will show the rifle to a serious buyer, in person...  If there is someone out there that has M16 parts (Legal with the proper tax stamps) this rifle can be converted to a real live M16 and you have a $20,000 rifle.

358,http://www.armslist.com/posts/866358,For Sale/Trade:  ANTIQUE JAPANESE SWORD MADE AROUND 1550 ...,"OHIO, Ohio, United States","$ 1,000","Listed On: Saturday, February 2, 2013",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a traditionally made Japanese made sword, also called Nihonto that was made around 1550, by a very famous sword smith, his name is as follows ;

MIHARA MASATSUGU


Here is the info / details on the sword / blade.

When i got the katana , it was just the blade and blade only, I made the saya for it, re worked an tsuka, sanded, and cut down to fit the nakago perfectly, added new ray skin, wrapped it myself, added high grade officer ww2 fittings, took me over 6 months to find a tusba that fit the blade perfectly, and made the habaki from a solid piece of brass, as you can see by the pics, it has great hada, and a beautiful hamon.

The blade was made during the KOTO period, and the tsuba was made in the early Edo period.

The blade does have a couple small battle marks, where this blade was used in combat by an Samurai, the nicks are not bad, but these do add value to the sword.

There are no fatal flaws, and no opening in the blade, and a recent full polish was done to it.

Its is signed by ;

MIHARA MASATSUGU


This a very beautiful blade, being it was made around 1550, makes it even more rare, and is a signed blade, with beautiful file marks on the Nakago.

Has only one pin hole, where it has been mounted just once in its life time, which adds more value to it.


This sword, the blade alone is well valued more then 2000.00, I have no use for it, I would rather have one of the items listed below, so this would be a great deal for someone willing to do the trade.

I also 5 antique Japanese arrows that will go with this sale one has a beautiful wide war point, two other have nice basic war type points, and the other two have practice tips on them, really beautiful arrows made in Japan a very long time ago.

I have plenty more pics, email me for more pics."

I bought it from the original owner and he didn't shoot it much and I know I haven't put a box of shells through it. The action is still extremely tight. It has 28 inch barrels and comes with a Cynergy hard case and the original 5 choke tubes. The original owner paid $1,928 for it new at Gander Mountain and I see on their web site that they are now $1,999 new. Please contact me through this site with any questions. Here are the specs from the Browning web site: The revolutionary Browning Cynergy is one of the most technologically advanced over and under shotguns on the market. It boasts an ultra-strong MonoLock Hinge with 300% more pivot surface area to distribute wear and a low profile receiver that reduces muzzle jump and perceived recoil. The exclusive Reverse Striker ignition system with mechanical triggers and a rifle-type striker provide faster locktime and reduced overtravel, while Impact Ejectors feature dual springs for positive, consistent ejection. The long travel Inflex Recoil Pad system reduces felt recoil as much as 25% and offers a wide range of length of pull adjustments. The synthetic camo receiver is Dura-Touch Armor Coated for added durability and the barrel selector is integrated with the top tang safety. Includes Vector Pro lengthened forcing cones and Invector-Plus full, modified, and improved cylinder choke tubes. Mossy Oak Duck Blind camo finish."

Browning Buck Mark rimfire pistols lead the industry in quality, reliability, accuracy and variety. Every Buck Mark starts out as a solid piece of aircraft-grade 7075 aluminum alloy, and then is CNC machined to exacting tolerances. The finger grooves, laser stippling and stylish wave patterns combine to form an Ergonomic Interactive Surface (EIS) that puts your hand in the same place on the grip for every shot, resulting in more instinctual shooting and improved accuracy. The textured surfaces are comfortable and secure in any condition, while the narrow profile makes them perfect for all hand sizes. Features alloy receiver with matte blue finish.

http://impeachandrewcuomo.com/

On January 15th, 2013, Governor Andrew Cuomo dealt a major blow to your second amendment rights. His new firearms bill will cost the state millions in new registration databases and enforcement, cost dealers thousands in absurd record keeping and make you a criminal for possessing the same firearms you owned legally on January 14th, 2013. All of these additional costs will burden the consumer and the tax payer. The new law will do nothing to curb gun violence or stop a mass murder. But those who voted for it and the Governor do not care; they don´t want you to own firearms PERIOD. Not only does this measure trample the very Constitution he swore to uphold, but it was rushed through in the middle of the night. The bill was not released to the public before it was voted on and Cuomo waived the mandatory three day cooling off period before forcing a vote. He is a treasonous tyrant who is out of control. Sign the petition below to impeach this man and restore our once great State from the top down.

I DO NOT WANT YOUR TRADES UNLESS IT IS SPECIFICALLY LISTED BELOW.  

Savage 10 Precision Carbine in .223 with a 20"" medium bull barrel, accu-stock & trigger, recessed target crown & a Vortex Viper PST 6-24 scope.  Has Ken Farrel base & rings, a Harris bi-pod with an A.R.M.S. QD cam mount, forward pic rail (for bi-pod) & sling.  Scope has the EBR-1 MOA reticle that is night vision capable & illuminated.  A very quality piece of equipment that's almost $1k new.  It is equipped with Sharp Shooter Supply bottom metal & 3 high-cap (11 rounds, but better than 4) magazines.  Magazines are available through Wyatt's for $68 & are very well made & heavy duty.  The bottom metal is a drop in replacement & no longer made.  This was a very costly mod. & took over 8 months to get.  Also included is a single shot ""sled"" that works instead of a magazine for range or BR shooting.  This replaces the factory bottom metal, but it is also included if you want to make it a 5 shot rifle again.

This is a ""one-hole"" rifle & capable of sub 1/2 minute patterns.  I have shot several 5 round groups that is 1 ragged hole @ 100 yards.  Great gopher, or varmint rifle or just fun to shoot.  Also included is around 100 rounds of ammunition.  Some heavy match (mostly 68gr. HP).  $1695 cash.    Do the research before sending hate mail, please.  These rifles are hard to find & very costly.  It's getting too expensive to shoot even .223.  Call or text REDACTED  Thanks for looking.

I would be interested in a pre-1964 Winchester .243, a Winchester pre-war 1894 in 30-30 or similar as a partial trade.  I also like Savage 99s in 30-30, 250-3000, or 300 Savage.  A Ruger 10/22 Team U.S.A. TD would also interest me.  I like Colt revolvers, but don't expect an even trade unless it's a Python in the box.  Mainly I want cash.  No AR-15/10 trades wanted.  No tupperware guns.  No AKs, imported cold war guns.  No boats, cars, lawn care, etc.  If your gun is selling for $500 on Gunbroker, don't offer it as an even trade, you are wasting your time."

Product Description

For AR-15 / M16 type rifles, optical sights provide superior performance at longer ranges, but iron sights can be more effective for close-range engagements. However, attaching an optical sight either prevents the use of iron sights or results in a setup that produces a front sight ""shadow"" on the optical image, and/or results in problematic transitions from optical to backup iron sights. Not anymore. Rapid Transition Sights (RTS) provide shooters with the quickest possible transition between longer- and closer-range target acquisition, greatly increasing their efficiency and effectiveness in battle and competition. These sights mount directly to a weapon's Picatinny rail, offset from center by approximately 45°. This unique offset position makes transitioning from optical to iron sights simply a matter of quickly canting the weapon with your wrists and locking on to the target. There's no removing a hand from the weapon or making a manual adjustment, and no cluttered field of vision or iron sights blocking the optical sight. Just smooth, quick transitions that could mean the difference between winning or losing a competition, or more importantly - a gunfight. Weight: Rear sight - 3 ounces (85g) / Front sight - 1.5 ounces (44g)

This is the first year production on the Light Twelve model.  Based on the Brownings web page the year would be a 1954-55. (Serial number is L69810).  The blueing is in pretty bad shape, the forearm has the typical crack from past owner not understanding the heavy vs. light load setup.  Other than those two items its a really nice gun.

It cycles nicely and is dead on at 25 yards. This gun predates the use of ""High Velocity"" .22 rimfire ammo, so if you want to be accurate you need to purchase ""Standard Velocity"" .22 rimfire. I will include the 200 rounds of CCI Standard Velocity ammo that I have. It has a 6"" barrel and has a top break. You can push the release up with your thumb and empty/reload the entire cylinder without having to load/unload one at a time."

Picture from TangoDown Website

From TangoDown Website -- A basic problem for plastic magazines is that they have to have a constant curved interior to be molded in one piece. There is no other way. But the magazine well of the M16/AR-15 weapon system is straight. So much compromise has to be reached from a design standpoint to make the two work together. So side effects of magazines not dropping free, are often seen. The optimum solution would be a straight upper section to properly present cartridges through the magazine well, and a constant-radius lower section to accommodate remaining ammunition. However, this design has been impossible to produce in polymer… until now.

The patent pending two-piece modular construction allows us to create the ultimate magazine for many reasons. In addition to the proper magazine form, we are able to achieve maximum strength and integrity when the components are molded. Precision molding is achieved much easier on two small parts versus one large one. We can also mix materials, impossible with conventional plastic magazines. We can offer transparent-solid color lowers/high tensile strength upper sectioned magazines that avoid the brittle feed lip issue of all-single material construction. Modular construction makes perfect sense for the unprecedented strength- we eliminated the removable floor plate, so the magazine becomes a five-sided box. ARC Mag survives the impact that crushes metal magazines.

ARC Mag takes full advantage of the latest polymers available from the aerospace industry- materials impervious to the effects of solvents & lubricants. After molding, we permanently bond the two sections together with advanced adhesives during manufacturing, so no disassembly is possible, or required. ARC Mag has a unique low-friction semi-floating follower that is slotted to allow for easy magazine cleaning. Just dunk the ARC Mag in hot soapy water, rinse and invert to drain. That’s hassle-free maintenance. ARC Mag also features a premium stainless steel spring. Life expectancy for this spring is 100,000+ cycles.

Our design team created a magazine that could be handled by the operator in any condition- note the aggressive ridges front and rear. They allow a positive purchase when seating the ARC Mag. The deep waffle pattern on the magazine’s sides assist in rapid extraction from mag pouches. Every surface on the ARC Mag was given careful consideration to help out the operator."
