This one was made by Auto Ordinance (no Kahr junk) in West Hurley New York in September of 1975. The pictures you see below is the gun I have for sale, note the forward hand grip: it is NOT an AOW as it has a total factory length of 27” and there is no way to affix a stock to this. It has perfect wood and nice bluing, although there are a few very minor safe rubs.  This one came with a 13” barrel, it also comes with (6) 32rd stick mags.

these were made to be a ""value"" model of the A5. solid bird bustin workhorse. wood is in great shape, the receiver has got some rash on it -the camera flash makes it look worse than it really is.  it's a woods gun to be sure so you don't have to worry about running around with it and making it any less ""pretty"" - great piece of browning hardware. no longer in production.

Mag. The rifle is a 1996 build purchased new by my friend. It has been out of the safe only a few times with less than 50 rounds total fired. I have the rifle in my possession and would describe it conservatively as 95% condition. I have not found a mark of any significance anywhere. Included with the rifle is a Nikon Monarch UCC 5.5-16.5X44. The scope is in similar condition to the rifle. Accessories include BOSS-CR (conventional recoil) body, Browning woven/leather sling, Browning soft zipper case and two boxes (38 rounds) of Hornady Custom 162 gr. BTSP Interlock. Everything is in excellent condition. 

NOTE: The Monarch scope was mounted professionally in Leupold rings and base; however because of the length of the scope I feel it is too far forward for proper eye-relief and cannot be moved further back. A new base or extended rings will need to be purchased. I base this note on how the rifle fits me (6'2"").

First is a Winchester Model 9422 in 22S,L,LR. Serial number indicates this is either a 1978 or 79 build. This is an XTR version with non-checkered wood. It is complete and original except for a sling swivel in the buttstock and one mounted on the magazine tube. The wood and metal carry only insignificant use marks.

Second is a Weatherby Mark XXII 22LR tube magazine with Weatherby Mark XXII 4X50 scope. This is a Japanese-made rifle with serial number T00XXX (Perhaps someone can shed light on year of manufacture?). It is complete and original except the rear sight was missing when I bought it. I have since purchased (but not mounted) an original-style three-leaf replacement from Weatherby. The wood and metal carry only insignificant use marks.

A2- Bar10 308 - With factory upgraded Skeleton stock and Izzy Muzzle Brake

ONE OF THE MOST ACCURATE 308s ON THE MARKET

It is in perfect working order, with minimal signs of ever being used.

The Bushmaster .308 series was manufactured in late2004-2005

THIS IS NOT THE O.R.C.- This is the first edition that was built better than all the rest to beat the competition. was the only amidextrious 308 on the market! Perfect for Righties or Lefties!!! 
These guns sold for around $1,800 stock.

Heres what Bushmaster has to say about this gun:
The magazine controls are ingenious, both in how they have been adapted to the FAL magazine and in how their ergonomics offer the shooter improved control. The magazine catch is a spring-loaded latch that engages the locking lug on the FAL magazine’s upper rear face. The release is fully ambidextrous. When the release is pressed from either side, a lever retracts the latch and the magazine drops free.

Like the magazine catch, the bolt release is a departure. It consists of a one-piece bar that extends across the bottom of the rifle just forward of the trigger guard behind the magazine well. Pressing down on either side releases the bolt. The optional ambidextrous safety transforms the Bushmaster .308 into the only fully ambidextrous AR-type rifle available. Bushmaster also eliminated the sometimes inconvenient charging handle latch, replacing it with a hidden spring-loaded detent in the center of the charging handle that engages a recess in the upper receiver.

The upper and lower receivers are made of forged 7075-T6 aluminum. About half of the .308’s components interchange with those of .223-Rem. caliber rifles, but none are stressed, so reliability is unaffected. Two versions of the Bushmaster .308 are available—an A2 type with fixed carry handle and sights and an A3 variant with a flat top upper receiver and a three-rail gas block. Barrels are rifled with four lands and grooves in a 1:10"" right-hand twist.

The Bushmaster rifle came with an optional Ace Ltd. “ARFX” skeleton stock. This stock replaces the “A2” type fiberglass stock with one of hard anodized aluminum that is both lighter and stronger than the original. The stock has a closed-cell foam cover over the buffer tube. This provides a much improved cheek weld, and dampens vibration and noise. The stock comes with a 1/2"" thick recoil pad that has a “tacky” feel that helps hold the stock in position."

I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. I have much more invested in this weapon than my asking price.

This is a hard to find Lightweight Operator full size 1911 pistol chambered in 45ACP.  If you are reading this you probably already know the Springfield Operator is one of the best pistols around. 

This model sells for $1200 or more, This is the hard to find lightweight model with rail. it has had new night sights and new springs installed. It was carried for a while and shows a little wear on the slide. (nothing crazy just wanted to mention it, some people don't even notice it.)  

it has the original box, paperwork, cocbolo grips ( dual cannon) that are also hard to find, 2 magazines and  key for locking Main spring and kydex holster.  I am missing the mag holder that they come with. Wilson Combat SS grip screws and black textured grips (my favorite). Also a WILSON COMBAT mag well.  I have polished the barrel and feed ramp and internal metal surfaces.  All contact parts have been treated with militec 1 .  

This is a great shooter, it shoots better than I do. I never had it jam on any ammo.  

Any questions feel free to ask, You must be able to legally own a firearm.

I love this gun but i'm just too picky i guess.  This gun shoots very nice and I haven't had a problem with it.  The gun only comes with 1 mag and a case.  I will only do an even trade for a stainless (SILVER) model with night sites and 1 mag.  If you have a stainless (SILVER) model with out night sites then you will have to pay a little on your end.  I will also consider a trade for a glock 32 with a little money on your end depending on your set up.  I am FIRM on the price so anyone offering a lower price will be ignored.  This gun is completely worth the money and I will also let you test shoot it too.

I purchased this J-frame a month or so ago (manufactured in 2011), and I have fired 70 rounds (15-.357 and 55-.38). I dislike the wideness of the front sight, and I don’t feel like blowing all the money practicing to master it when I have another J-frame I’m perfectly content with. Function, finish and fit is everything I could ask for. There is a small scratch on the side plate and a couple other scratches here and there from carrying. It builds character.

I am really looking for a Ruger .204 but my second and third choices would be a 22-250 or a .243. 

I know my price range will probably keep me from getting the 22-250 but let's see what we can work out. 

All of that being said, I do have a budget but the budget depends on the rifle and any additional items included. I'm not looking to rip someone off as I'm not looking to be ripped off. I am willing to work out a deal for the right rifle but I will not pay new prices for a used rifle. I know the accessories can add up but I really don't need all of the bells and whistles. I simply need a tack driver at 300 yards that I am not afraid to scratch while in the woods. 

If you have something you think I might be interested in at a fair price, please send me an email with a couple of pictures as well as your asking price. I am not a great negotiator and tend to do my research before making an offer. If I make an offer on your rifle, it will be my best offer. If I feel your asking price is fair after doing some research I will simply accept your price and purchase the gun. If I feel we are too far apart, I will simply let you know I am not interested without making an offer. I do this because I understand that sometimes we carry a personal attachment to a weapon and often value it more than it's actually worth. I know I have several weapons I wouldn't sell unless the deal weighed heavily in my favor.

If you are interested in trading, I may have a few items to trade but I would prefer a cash deal as I don't like to get rid of my stuff :) However, if I need to in order to get the rifle I want, I will work something out.

Sorry for the lengthy message but I didn't want there to be any questions about how I deal. 

I am willing to drive up to an hour or so from Richmond for the right deal and a FTF trade. Even though I am the buyer, I would like to see your Indiana DL as well as complete a simple bill of sale.

Thank you"
