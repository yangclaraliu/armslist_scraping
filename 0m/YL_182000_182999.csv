Price dropped for quick sale! Brand new in box CZ 75B 40 Cal S&W in satin nickel finish. Absolutely brand new never even had a round placed in a mag. I purchased this because I always wanted a Czech walnut gripped 9mm but never got around to buying one and instead bought a S&W 5904 at the time. I bought this on a whim just to have it, but decided to carry an ultra compact 45 for personal protection so I'm offering this up for sale to purchase some home improvemant items. These are on backorder or otherwise unavailable anywhere you check online and are nowhere near this price locally especially with tax added.

Item/set-up was taken out of my Chevy Suburban. In Full working order with exception of a 12vdc neon tube inside the enclosure (can be replaced with ease and minimal cost). Also including remote Bass Boost module for the amp (lighted knob kind), - you will need a double mono 1/8 end cable to plug it in . As you see, there was no expense spared on this stereo (everything was purchased BRAND NEW), Amp was $800 shipped, Enclosure was $750+$150 shipping due to size/weight and capacitor was $200. So, not including all the terminals and wires, spare fuse and Bass Boost module This set-up was $1900. As you see from the pics, there are over $120 in wires and high end voltage distribution hardware. I ran this set-up via 0ga DC cables, second dedicated Optima Yellow Top Battery with upgraded to 130AMP Bosch alternator and Battery Isolator (none listed are included) as this is a power house and, obviously draws some juice. Capacitor helps big time, thus was added into the initial installation mix from the beginning and proved to be a huge value. Any questions, shoot me an email."

I cleaned it up and mounted a rail to the side and the bottom of the stock. It has been painted desert sand with the grips left black for contrast. I have mounted a 3-9x42 compact scope on it with a red lighted reticle. Its sighted in, but I do have the original iron sights with it as well. I will include the scope and the laser with pressure switch that I mounted as its a good fit and match.

459,http://www.armslist.com/posts/182459,Want To Buy:  DONATE UNSAFE OR UNWANTED FIREARMS FOR HUNTER EDUCATION USE,"Wichita, Wichita, Kansas",Offer,"Listed On: Saturday, September 24, 2011",Shotguns,no type,no type,no type,Shotgun,"I am a Hunter Education Instructor looking for help. If you have any old, unwanted guns around, unsafe or otherwise, I would like to turn them into non-firing models for use in classes. We can use any firearm, modern or old, any style, about any condition, as long as it's reasonably complete. If you have any old barrels that have been exploded out, that would make a great demonstration tool as well.

To be clear, this is not something the state or Wildlife and Parks is officially doing at this point. I am looking for tools I can use in my classes, and which I can lend to other instructors for their classes. Currently, we have to use toy guns, which is better than nothing, or our own hunting firearms, which have to be extremely carefully monitored, especially with larger groups. The safer and more effective way is to bring in the real thing, disabled and painted up to show so. This allows us to actually demonstrate safely loading and unloading dummy ammo, as well as ways to verify that a real gun is unloaded, with each student getting a chance for hands-on with a variety of firearm types. Another value of the real thing is in its weight. We can show how carrying a real gun can make arms tired, and the effect of that on safely carrying in the field.

So, if you have anything you'd like to offer, it would be greatly appreciated.  

Thanks for your time.
Dave

PS: I've gotten queries about upcoming classes, and should have mentioned this before.  Class season is just starting, so keep an eye on www.safehunters.com to find a class for you or your kids.

Very clean, well taken care of, correctly built M4gery with a round count of about 1000 rounds through the pipe; about 500 through the original CMMG BCG it came with and another 500 or so on the current LMT bolt carrier group (bcg). I’d like to sell this as a package deal, the gun, accessories, mags, holsters, bag, ammo, and brass, but I’m negotiable.

Parts list with the price I paid for them:

$125 - stripped lower receiver by SI Defense out of Kalispell, MT (I wanted it ""made in Montana"")
$70 - Daniel Defense lower parts kit
$110 - Magpul CTR (mil-spec) stock kit with heavy buffer, not carbine buffer (meant to slow cycling and compliment the auto carrier's longer lock time to reduce wear and add longevity)
$25 - Magpul rear sling attachment plate
$50 - Magpul MS2 adjustable sling; very comfortable and easily goes from 1pt to 2pt configuration
$20 - Magpul  front sling attachment ring
$30 - Magpul MOE handguard 
$35 – Magpul B.A.D (Battery Assist Device) lever
$20 - Magpul MVG forward grip
$50 - Magpul MBUS rear buis; rear sights have a lower 1/3 cowitness through the red dot sight tube
$75 - tritium front sight post and two dot tritium rear aperture installed into MBUS sight...very bright green dots.
$160 - ADM 1” quick detach riser & Primary Arms microdot rds; red dot is very bright in the sunlight and has 11 settings so at night it can be very dim if needed. comes with bikini cover. mount is rock solid and locks securely in place and keeps zero after repeated removals when needed
$20 - Ergo grip; has 2 cr123a batteries and two rounds stored inside
$16 - 5x Magpul pmags with windows and round level indicators
$500 - CMMG 14.5” 4150 cmv steel barreled, 1/7 twist, 5.56 chamber, chrome lined chamber & bore, phosphated finish including under fsb, pinned yhm phantom flash hider with aggressive tip (pinned per law to be 16”), mpt/hpt/shot peened barrel, m4 feed ramps properly cut, “government” or m4 contoured barrel..includes original CMMG bcg (good backup) lightly used until replaced with the LMT bcg listed below. Bore never scrubbed with metal brush, and never had a metal rod in the bore…just properly bore snaked clean.
$140 - LMT bolt carrier group (BCG) full auto carrier with shrouded firing pin; mpt/hpt/shotpeened with gas key properly staked, gas key tool steel per mil-spec also.
$45 - BCM gunfighter  big latch charging handle

$40 - two double mag pouches
$50 - padded carry case with 4 pockets for mags and shoulder strap

There's some other items that cost me money on this gun but you get the point. While this all adds up to just over $2100 I do realize this gun has a round count. I'm in need of bill paying and just can't hold out any longer on this and must sell it. I'm including what I paid so you can measure the value of what I want for it all. 

Always carefully cleaned after every few hundred rounds and properly lubed with twb25 grease, never dropped, no blemishes, dings, scratches, nothing. It's an outstanding gun I built (one of many I've built over the years) adhering to every possible military specification I could find (arfcom, m4carbine.net, etc.) so it is no ""boutique"" or ""hobby"" gun, it's a battle rifle through and through.

$1350 is what I""m after. It’s as low as I’m comfortable going and plenty of sacrifice so please don’t low ball me. I'll only drive as far north as Missoula for delivery if you can't make it to Hamilton. Too much stuff to ship so don't ask. This is your chance to get a non 4473'd top quality battle carbine with 400+ rounds and all the accessories you'd need...and brass to reload with. I need cash only, sorry no trades.  I’ve made a good, high resolution “video tour” of the gun if you’d like to see it up close and personal…just don’t mind my fat butt.  If you want to buy this gun, please be sure you are legally able to do so and make sure you live in Montana too.
Thanks for looking!"

Overall really nice gun for the money. I've been pricing them around the area and have come to the conclusion that just the gun itself with one magazine is close to $90-$100 cheaper if you were to buy this one instead of going to a gun store. Magazines usually go for about $30-$40 and the grip that i have on it is a hard one to find. The gun does have some Holster wear but nothing that would deter anyone from purchasing.

I am possibly looking to sell my Saiga S12 (yes the one that is almost impossible to find now). The gun has NOT had the trigger conversion done but all the other tune ups including new gas ports,polished bolt amd carrier, new gas adjuster, quad rail mall ninja kit, 3 10 and 12 round mags, a 100 round drum, and more.

I have spent a lot of time getting this gun in this condition and it fires like a champ. 90% of sagas suffer from a frustrating FTE issue befoe they are broken in or nodded, I have had ZERO failures in the past month with everyone from cheap federal, 6 shot, 8 shot, 3"" mags, and my favorite, the army shells from Olin (00 buck). The gas system works like a dream and you rarely need to turn it past the second setting. 

This gun draws a crowd and if you have been to shooters center in Racine on a Saturday morning, you have probably seen it. The guys at shooters know me by name and as the saiga guy so they can tell you all the work time and money that's gone into getting this gun perfect.

Saiga prices are all over the map right now, and if you ask the crooks at the gun show they will tell you anything from they are ging to be banned to there is a shortage at the izmatsch plant. I don't believe any of this to be true, but the fact is they are hard to gt right now and for the forseeable future. 

I am typing is from my iPad so I don't have pics but if you search arms list for saiga Milwaukee you can see the gun.

I am looking for AR style guns, a nice .45 cal - preferably 1911, or anything else that's intersting.

This gun is like a Harley, you can continue to build on it or just keep it as is. 

I dpnt have a set price but if you are offering a trade, it needs to be worth at least $1700. Cash won't be as appealing so please don't send me silly emails. My original plan was to sell this gun and start on a new one, but now that they are going for $1000 and up, I am abandoning that plan"

Those of you that are addicted to collecting these know what I am talking about.  This gun has a very clean bore.  It is not a jumbled up, mix n' match surplus gun like some of them that are floating around. It even has vintage cereal box pieces from the 1950s that I found in the fore-end stock.  Somebody put them there a long time ago to either free-float the barrel, make a more snug fit, or quiet some rattling.  I left them in the stock, so you get a little extra piece of history with the deal!

The rifle has only seen 430 rounds through it and still needs to be broken in some more. I'm the original owner and have scrubbed the weapon after every range session. Everything from the muzzle to the firing pin doesn't have an ounce of gunk on it. Barrel and insides were oiled before storage.

Upon sale or trade the original parts that were swapped out will go too along with its original springfield case (the case came with a holster, ammo holster, original paperwork, mags, and a set of keys that lock the gun rendering it useless to kids or thieves you decide).

What quickly and dramatically sets the Ruger LCR apart from and ahead of the many old 5-shot, double action .38 Specials is the wondrous double-action trigger pull. While the trigger gauge shows it as about a nine pound trigger, Ruger has refined the trigger geometry and spring rates so it feels much lighter. The LCR has a smooth and consistent trigger pull that makes it relatively easy to cycle the cylinder and fire this revolver while maintaining a constant sight picture. As that is the whole idea with a personal defense pistol, Ruger can't be commended too highly for pulling this one off. It has an out-of-the box feel as if it had been tuned by the likes of Jack Weigand. The LCR is that smooth.

The primary ammo used was the Stars & Stripes Custom Ammo 125 grain Speer Gold Dot combat rounds. Shooting through the CED M2 chrono screens, the 5 foot velocity ranged from 767 – 796 fps, which is formidable, especially taking into consideration the diminutive 1-1/8 inch LCR barrel. After shooting fifty rounds of this ammo through the Ruger LCR, I can't call this revolver the ideal plinker by any means, but calling the recoil quite manageable is a fair assessment. It was surprisingly manageable considering the light weight of this handgun. For comparison, let me mention one of my least favorite type of handguns, the common .380 blowback semi-auto. Many of them are just nasty little palm-slappers, with crummy trigger pulls and an unfortunate propensity to stovepipe. Often you'll find them with merciless hard plastic crucifix type grips and slides that find new ways to slice the top of your hand, as well.

It's not true of all .380s, to be sure, but palm-slapping, hand-slicing stove-piping little monsters with snag-o-matic external hammers are something I genuinely revile. It is the exact opposite of what I'd want to rely on in a high-stress, self-defense situation. In fact, the only .380 that I personally consider fun to shoot for extended periods is a Makarov IJ-70 and even the IJ-70 wears a set of of Pearce grips.

The .380 genre of pistol, even with good ammo like Speer Gold Dot, suffers in penetration compared to a .38 Special revolver. You need only compare the sectional densities of a 90-95 grain .380 bullet to a 125-158 grain .38 Special bullet to see why.

The benefits of a wheelgun for personal defense are straightforward and well known. Stovepiping and failures to feed are not a possible and cycling past a dead round requires only a second pull of the trigger. Anything that is tethered to the function of the ammo to work is going to be less reliable than an action that is not.

Setting up at 10 yards, I emptied the LCR as fast as I could into a Shoot-N-C target. The results were more than adequate to neutralize most intimate threats, with actual use likely to be at less than half that distance. Published studies vary a bit, but most self-defense applications are measured in feet, not yards. A friend of mine likes to put it this way, “If I was purposely going to a gunfight, I'd use something else.” So would I, as a matter of fact. However, that isn't the point. We aren't going to gunfights, we simply want the ability to defend ourselves and our families should we be unexpectedly forced to do so. In this regard, the Ruger LCR shines. It is easily carried, swift to deploy, manageable in recoil allowing for confident initial shot and follow-up shot placement, is clearly a well-built, and fundamentally reliable protection piece.

For in the home only defense, certainly a 12 gauge pump like the current Ithaca Model 37 Home Defense gun with a 20 inch barrel and a moderate load of #1 buck could be considered a more forgiving, effective approach. When concealability and portability are paramount, the only form of self-defense that matters is the one you have access to at that precise moment.

The LCR is available with laser grips, but the approach I prefer has just been announced by XS Sight Systems for 2010, an improved standard dot Tritium front sight for the Ruger Part Number: RP-0008N-4. I'll get one installed as soon as I can.

The Ruger LCR is a rare revolver, one that is optimized for a specific application, and fulfills the fast handling, ease of use, speed of use, outstanding build quality with a mass produced, double-action trigger pull that has never before been equaled in this personal self-defense platform. It is a home-run for Ruger and a winner in this category of this revolver with no question in my mind. Ruger has extended and improved the breed with their little LCR .38 Special +P."
