Here is a lightly used, well cared for kel-Tec Sub-2000 in 9mm that uses the ever popular Glock magazines.  It is the perfect compliment to your Glock 17, 19, or 26 pistol.

This Sub-2000 has several upgrades, most notable a Blue Force Gear AR-style front sight replacement. This heavy-duty tactical sight has a protected front post with a tritium insert for night visibility and adjusts for elevation with a standard AR15 sight post tool.  It also has a picitiny rail underneath for attaching a light, as shown in the pictures (Streamlite NOT included).  The rifle retains its original folding and locking ability.

The rifle's cheek rest has a polymer cover, also from Blue Force Gear.  Last, the pistol grip has a grip sleeve to improve grip and better fill the shooter's hand.

Also included is a new Kel-Tec soft bag specifically designed for the Sub-2000, as well as the original box, original 10 round Glock magazine, documentation, and all accessories.

Optional:  I have several Glock OEM 33 round magazines for the Sub 2000 that can be purchased for $80 each (4 available).  These are true Glock magazines, not an aftermarket ""me too"" product.

in Springfield will walk all over YOUR constitutional right to keep and bear arms.

EVENT DETAILS

WHEN:  Sunday, January 20, 2013, 2:00 PM

WHERE:  Wilmette Public Library, 1242 Wilmette AVE, Wilmette, IL

WHO:  This event is being hosted by a band of gun controllers 
including Mark Walsh of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence; 
Lee Goodman of Stop Concealed Carry Coalition and; Jennifer Bishop of the Million Mom 
March.  
These people are the real deal - the hard core top dogs of the gun control movement.  
These are the people leading the charge to raid your gun safe and 
confiscate and destroy your guns.  These are the people who want to 
prevent you from carrying defensive firearms.  
These are the people who don't care if you or your family members are raped, 
robbed and murdered by violent criminals.  They only care about one thing - disarming 
you.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRO-GUN PEOPLE

1.  Plan to be at the Wilmette Library between 1:00 and 1:30 so that you can get a seat.  

At past events like these, the anti-gunners try to play a game claiming 
that the room is ""full"" so as to  deny entry to pro-gun people.  
Our aim is to ensure that there are more of OUR people there than THEIR people.

2.  Be observant of abuses of your First Amendment rights by village officials.  
Get the name and title of any official who attempts to 
suppress your right of free association, assembly and speech.

3.  If you have an I-GOLD t-shirt, hat, or badge, wear it!  
If you have an ISRA hat or an NRA hat, wear it!

4.  If you see members of the media there, don't wait for them to come to you.  
Rather,  actively approach them, tell them you are a law-abiding firearm owner, 
and then tell them that you adamantly oppose punitive gun control laws 
being proposed by the organizers, Obama, and Emanuel.  
Make sure the media hears our side of the story first, and often!

5.  Bring your children, grand children, and other young people with you.  
They are the next generation of patriots.  Let them see how effective 
grassroots organizing works!  If there is a question and answer session, 
have your children ask the organizers why they want to leave kids 
and their parents defenseless against criminals.

6.  Be polite, but be assertive.  Do not let the anti-gunners shout you down.  
Defend your 2nd Amendment with passion.  
If you have a smart phone, video as much of the proceedings as you can.

7.  Remember, this is our Lexington, this is our Concord.  
Be prepared to teach the gun controllers a lesson in Liberty.

8.  Please share this Alert with your friends and family - 
encourage them to show up at the rally.

9.  Please post this Alert to any and all Internet blogs 
and bulletin boards to which you belong

REMEMBER - YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRESERVING YOUR FREEDOM - 
IF YOU DON'T DO IT, NOBODY ELSE WILL"

Purchased and never fired. 
No problems with. No blemishes. Perfect shape. Have original everything.

This is the Benelli equivalent, made by same company, at a lower price. Same shotgun as the Benelli Nova.

12-ga. P-350 Defense is a 3½"" chambered slide-action shotgun with a pistol-grip polymer buttstock. 
The shotgun has an overall weight of around 6½ lbs. and an overall length of 39¾"" with an 18½"" barrel. 
The polymer buttstock features a 1"" ventilated recoil pad and a molded-in sling attachment point, matched to a steel sling swivel on the shotgun's magazine cap. 

Operationally, the P-350 Defense employs a 4140 steel bolt assembly with a rotating, multi-lug head. The bolt head locks directly into a barrel extension, which is threaded onto the rear of the P-350 Defense's barrel. This allows the shotgun to employ a lightweight 7012-T6 aluminum alloy receiver. In addition, the multi-lug, rotating-bolt system of operation provides an extremely strong lock up. The end result is a strong and lightweight shotgun. Dual action bars have pretty much become the standard these days in slide-action shotguns, but the P-350 takes that design a step further. One of the theoretical advantages of dual action bars, which connect the sliding fore-end to the bolt assembly, is reduced action binding as well as added strength over a single bar.

And if you want to convert it to a full evil AK you can add the bullet button (I hate them, but you can for now). Will go to any dealer in West of El Cajon and South of Miramar, including the aformentioned cities. I will only meet those who put in any acceptable offer first.

Its lightly used and has been converted back to having a pistol grip and stock (both US made, polymer) instead of the thumbhole one that K.S.I. sold em with. It also has a g2 trigger set thus bringing it into compliance with the 922r foreign parts limit.

I've shot this rifle a few times and it seems to keep around a 2"" group @ 100yrds 1"" right of the very center point. That part could be my trigger pull habits though, hard to say.

Anywho, I have the original trigger set and sling as well as one 30rnd magazine. I might still have some ammo, but Ill have to look.

Currently the rifle is painted all matte olive green (Krylon paint) with some snakeskin pattern brown

For those who arent famailiar with the Norinco Mak 90:

More MAK-90 rifles were imported from China than any other model of semi automatic AK type rifle from any other country. The model name MAK-90 stands for Modified AK-1990.This was because AK rifles with pistol grips, folding stocks, threaded muzzles and bayonets were banned from importation to the USA in 1989. The first AK rifles imported in 1990 after the ban were modified by replacing the the pistol grip and stock with a one piece wooden thumbhole stock. The threaded end of the barrel had a muzzle nut screwed on to cover the threads and some were tack welded on. The bayonet lug was ground down so a bayonet wouldn't lock on. The model name was ground off and the modified rifle had the new model name MAK-90 stamped on them. Some had 90 added to the serial number that denoted the year of import. The MAK-90 rifles imported after 1990 had the threads on the muzzle turned off and a 2 digit year of import stamped in front of or in back of the serial number. Some have a space or dash between the serial number and 2 digit year of import stamping. There were a half dozen or so companies that imported MAK-90 rifles. The importers company name, city and state will be stamped on one side or the bottom of the receiver. Some had it stamped on the barrel between the gas block and front sight.

All MAK-90 rifles have stamped sheet metal receivers except for one lot of rifles imported in 1993 that had receivers milled from a solid block of steel. The two types of receivers can be distinguished from each other easily because the stamped receiver has rivets holding it together and the milled receiver has no rivets.

The MAK-90 has a larger diameter barrel,1.5mm thick stamped sheet metal receiver and the double hook disconector of the Ak-47. Other models of AK rifles imported from other countries with the same length barrel have smaller diameter barrels,1mm thick stamped sheet metal receivers, and the single hook disconector of the AKM rifle. The front sight of the MAK-90 has a fully enclosed hood/sight protector with a hole in the top and a smooth receiver cover of the AK-47 Vs. the sight protector that is open on the top and ribbed receiver cover of the AKM.

The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE is at the forefront with Tapco's 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but Tapco has made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, they made the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, they redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, they made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But they didn't just stop on improving the spring, they also totally revamped the follower.

Tapco has kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won't be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag.

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

DICK ACT of 1902 . . . CAN'T BE REPEALED (GUN CONTROL FORBIDDEN) The Trump Card Enacted by the Congress Further Asserting the Second Amendment as Untouchable The Dick Act of 1902 also known as the Efficiency of Militia Bill H.R. 11654, of June 28, 1902 invalidates all so-called gun-control laws. It also divides the militia into three distinct and separate entities. The three classes H.R. 11654 provides for are the organized militia, henceforth known as the National Guard of the State, Territory and District of Columbia , the unorganized militia and the regular army. The militia encompasses every able-bodied male between the ages of 18 and 45.

The Dick Act of 1902 cannot be repealed; to do so would violate bills of attainder and ex post facto laws which would be yet another gross violation of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The President of the United States has zero authority without violating the Constitution to call the National Guard to serve outside of their State borders. The National Guard Militia can only be required by the National Government for limited purposes specified in the Constitution (to uphold the laws of the Union ; to suppress insurrection and repel invasion). These are the only purposes for which the General Government can call upon the National Guard. Attorney General Wickersham advised President Taft, ""the Organized Militia (the National Guard) can not be employed for offensive warfare outside the limits of the United States ."" The Honorable William Gordon, in a speech to the House on Thursday, October 4, 1917, proved that the action of President Wilson in ordering the Organized Militia (the National Guard) to fight a war in Europe was so blatantly unconstitutional that he felt Wilson ought to have been impeached. During the war with England an attempt was made by Congress to pass a bill authorizing the president to draft 100,000 men between the ages of 18 and 45 to invade enemy territory, Canada . The bill was defeated in the House by Daniel Webster on the precise point that Congress had no such power over the militia as to authorize it to empower the President to draft them into the regular army and send them out of the country. The fact is that the President has no constitutional right, under any circumstances, to draft men from the militia to fight outside the borders of the USA , and not even beyond the borders of their respective states. Today, we have a constitutional LAW which still stands in waiting for the legislators to obey the Constitution which they swore an oath to uphold. Charles Hughes of the American Bar Association (ABA) made a speech which is contained in the Appendix to Congressional Record, House, September 10, 1917, pages 6836-6840 which states: ""The militia, within the meaning of these provisions of the Constitution is distinct from the Army of the United States ."" In these pages we also find a statement made by Daniel Webster, ""that the great principle of the Constitution on that subject is that the militia is the militia of the States and of the General Government; and thus being the militia of the States, there is no part of the Constitution worded with greater care and with more scrupulous jealousy than that which grants and limits the power of Congress over it."" ""This limitation upon the power to raise and support armies clearly establishes the intent and purpose of the framers of the Constitution to limit the power to raise and maintain a standing army to voluntary enlistment, because if the unlimited power to draft and conscript was intended to be conferred, it would have been a useless and puerile thing to limit the use of money for that purpose. Conscripted armies can be paid, but they are not required to be, and if it had been intended to confer the extraordinary power to draft the bodies of citizens and send them out of the country in direct conflict with the limitation upon the use of the militia imposed by the same section and article, certainly some restriction or limitation would have been imposed to restrain the unlimited use of such power."" The Honorable William Gordon Congressional Record, House, Page 640 - 1917"

I can't really say anything bad about the well loved (and well used) SKS's out there that are the most common, as they're built like tanks and I've never had any problems with any of them. The stocks are ugly, and the bluing is worn, but they always work great. 

But this particular SKS has a very nice stock, and minor (if any) bluing wear. It's a step up from the average SKS. I've owned probably 10 SKS's in my day, and this is hands down the nicest one. No contest. If you're looking for a stock SKS, this is the one!

Also included is an eotech 512 model that takes double A batteries. The diodes in the eotech are fading a bit. It's hard to see them in heavy light. I'm not particularly sure what the issue is but it could be a battery connection problem or it could need to be refurbished by eotech. From what I have been told, if the sight is in warranty, it will be replaced or repaired for free. If it's not, it will cost you $58 to have it completely refurbished. Nonetheless, it still works fine in lower levels of light. Also included is a Vector Optics green laser. This is a very high quality laser and is extremely bright. The laser alone cost me a pretty penny. Also included will be one, 50 round magazine. I will consider partial trades for steel AK magazines, 7.62x39, and perhaps a few other things that I need. Sell will occur in or around the Salisbury area. I will ship the rifle if you are from another state but it will be at your cost.

Steve Stockman (R-Texas) has barely had a chance to get his feet wet in Congress again, after serving one term from 1995-1997. But already he's making bold threats to file articles of impeachment against President Barack Obama over gun control measures being sought in the wake of December's mass shooting in Newtown, Conn.

In a statement released Monday, Stockman accused Obama of seeking an ""unconstitutional and unconscionable attack on the very founding principles of this republic"" in the president's recent suggestion that he was willing to undertake executive action toward to goal of reducing gun violence.

""I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary, including but not limited to eliminating funding for implementation, defunding the White House, and even filing articles of impeachment,"" Stockman pledged. ""The president’s actions are an existential threat to this nation. The right of the people to keep and bear arms is what has kept this nation free and secure for over 200 years. The very purpose of the Second Amendment is to stop the government from disallowing people the means to defend themselves against tyranny. Any proposal to abuse executive power and infringe upon gun rights must be repelled with the stiffest legislative force possible.""

Fury mounted in conservative circles last week when Vice President Joe Biden, leader of Obama's task force on gun violence, said that the president was prepared to to take executive action on the issue. Obama confirmed the broader plan at a press conference on Monday, clarifying that he thought such steps were within his authority. Congressional officials have since claimed that the president is weighing 19 steps that could be taken through executive action alone.

OKAY -------- WALKER ! YOUR NEXT FOLLOW TEXAS AND THERE TOP NOTCH GOVERNOR !
""WE THE PEOPLE ---> “The Right to Bear Arms.” Everyone has heard this statement before. It is the second amendment of the constitution that states that we the people of The United States of America have the right to own a firearm. Recently, our government has been taking the necessary steps to abolish this amendment. Owning a gun is a right, not a privilege. We as citizens have to protect the second amendment so we can protect ourselves if necessary.

No one is capable of taking away all arms. Every gun in the country cannot be tracked down. The amount of money it would take to go door to door collecting firearms could be spent on lowering all types of crime. There are numerous people who would not give up their guns. What would happen to these people; be imprisoned because they want to be free? It is possible that this could result in another civil war. There are a number of people who live on the streets who carry a pistol in their pocket. How will these gun owners be found if they don’t even have a home?

     Has anyone ever thought of how the people would defend themselves if our country was invaded in a war? If a war is fought here, the only protection we can count on is our military. They can’t defend this country forever. In the American Revolution, the colonists had to defend themselves from the British. What would America do if her beloved military failed? Citizens would be forced to defend their lives and homes. They would need arms in order to be successful. We couldn’t possibly fight against a great force without war implements.

NOTE: WE ARE HERE IN UNITED STATES ARE  NO LONGER THE ONLY SUPERPOWER IN THE WORLD , BIG THINGS HAVE CHANGED ! WE ARE IN DEBT TO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES TO SAY THE LEAST. 
WE TRUE LAW ABIDING, TAX PAYING AMERICANS MUST STAND STRONG! TOGETHER AS BROTHER SISTER AND FAMILY. WE ALL KNOW HOW TO BALANCE OUR CHECKBOOKS AND IF WE DONT BALANCE OUR FAMILY'S BUDGET WE WILL CERTAINLY BE SUED OR JAILED FOR WRITING BAD CHECKS. THIS GOVERNMENT IS FUNDAMENTALLY NOT CONNECTED WITH ITS PEOPLE, OUT OF TOUCH COMPLETELY , UNETHICALLY UNBALANCED.  3 DECADES , HERE WE GO AGAIN OF FALSE PROMISES NEVER KEPT! WHEN WILL WE LEARN???"
