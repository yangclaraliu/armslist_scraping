Cure for the common pistol. Built in the Kimber Custom Shop, Raptor .45 ACPs take their name from dynamic slide and frame serrations, feathered logo grips and finish accents. While the design theme is unique, performance is exactly what shooters expect from Kimber-unequaled.



Stored in safe, never carried less than 2 clips through it. It's in 99% condition.
I just has a jackass email me trying to explain I was lying about the condition because if the pistol had been fired It was not 99%, could not be at all.
Told me to go check my gun values. Most of the real 1911 aficionados out there know the gun was fired at the factory. Some companies run 1 round, some 8 and some up to 80 in higher end guns. I did not carry it, it has not been in a holster. The gun has been fired less than My Mint new Wilson Combat which did get fired 80 rounds at the factory.
Hell I would rather know a gun worked if I was ordering it. Some people
So the gun was sold mint new and it was fired. Therefore it was at 100% condition.

If I ran 2 mags through it to make sure I liked it, well you want to guess at it and that's fine with me, but there is no deceit taking place, my description should have been fine. 97 percent ok with the thread cop? Just a perfect gun and didn't want to use NEW.

IF you have questions please let me know.

Photos are exactly like it, just used stock photos until I can get the photos taken.

I am not going to be dealing on it, it's very hard to come buy, Blued used models sell $950 to $1000.00 and we all know that's going to rub off quicker and it doesn't look as nice as the stainless in my eyes. 

This model is hard to find, and I am not going to take advantage of that fact, but I am not willing to sell it for a loss at all. 
I know I can sell it, and I would not hate keeping it. Just carry a nicer gun now and never broke it  in.

I bought it in 2001 from Gander Mtn in Eau Claire, WI - still have all the paper work.  I had the open sights taken off by the Gander Mtn gunsmith.  He plugged the holes with flat-head screws.  They could be removed.  Unfortunately, I don't have th original open sights.  I lost them in a move in 2003.  They were far inferior to today's fiber optic sights, so there really isn't much lost on that one.

The gun is in good shape, but bears the markings of a ""hunter"".  There are some blemishes on the barrel, but they may be able to be worked out.  The stock is actually in 99% condition.

The gun has a Bushnell Sportview 3-9X Duplex mounted to a weaver rail with Leupold Rings.  I also have it fixed with studs and a very nice Butler Creek shoulder strap.  It also comes with a Rem 597 case. 

This gun is a shooter.  It doesn't like fancy match ammo at all.  But, it shoots the hell out of Federal Classics (100 rounds included).  It's also very good with CCI MiniMags (50 round included) and Remington High Velocity (35 rounds included).  I can easily hold a 1"" group at 50 yards.  I know it can do better than that, but all I ever use are the plastic front rests at the range.  At 25 yards, all holes are touching.  The gun doesn't jam, and cycles very nicely.  It comes with two plastic clips - one works perfectly and the other sticks once in a while.  I tiny bit of lube might make it better.  

I haven't done any trigger work, and it would benefit a lot from an improved trigger.  The lawyers at Remington went a little overboard with the safety.  This things is about a 9 pound pull.  

Some 597's can be problematic.  This is a ""good one"".  It has always served me well.  So, why am I getting rid of it?  Because these days, my small arms interest lie with air rifles (damn good air rifles).  I just don't shoot my rimfires anymore.

The gun is priced to move.  Add it all up.  I'm not trying to squeeze every penny out of it, because I mostly just want to find it a good home.  It would make a great first rifle for a new hunter.  At the same time, I'll not be talked down any more.  The price is firm and if it doesn't go for the asking price, I'll just hang on to it until I meet a kiddo who deserves it. 

I'd be willing to drive as much as 20 miles to meet up with the buyer."

Probably the best trained defensive shooter in the country, Dr. Ignatius Piazza
chooses and carries ""Glock"".

http://frontsight.com/newsletter/html/17-right-gun.html 

 I will tell it to you straight because Front Sight does not sell guns in our pro shop.  We have no beneficial interest in any gun manufacturer and there is no ""Front Sight Service Pistol"" being promoted to anyone.  We are as pure as the driven snow as far as our interest in directing you to what is the best choice for a simple, reliable, and easy to use handgun that carries lots of fight-stopping cartridges.

Simplicity: The Glock is by far the simplest.  Trigger, magazine release, and slide release.  That's it.  The Glock is as simple as it gets. What about the Safety? Glocks have a safety on the trigger.  Safety is between your ears, so keep your finger out of the trigger guard until your sights are on the target.  We train YOU to be safe with ANY gun. We routinely place Glocks in the hands of students taking our courses who have never shot a gun before and they do extremely well with them and are extremely safe with them. 

Ease of use:  The Glock wins again with a trigger press that is essentially the same with each shot and has no safety lever to engage.

Accuracy:  Accuracy is really about YOU and not the gun.  Consistency is a better term to describe the gun.  Put the gun in a vice. How consistent is it in shooting a tight group?   You cannot hold the gun as steady as a vice, so all modern handguns are more consistent than you can accurately hold them.  If you can't shoot a tight group it is not the handgun.  The good news is we can train you to shoot accurately up to the consistency of your gun.

Speed:  Glock wins again.  The less you have to do to shoot the gun, the smoother and faster it is to deliver a fight-stopping hit. When we teach you how to properly re-rest the trigger for your second and subsequent shots, you will be amazed at how fast you can shoot an auto-loading pistol ACCURATELY.

So what do I carry? I can carry and shoot any gun extremely well.  I choose to carry. a Glock.  Why? Because in a gun fight, I too will only be half as good and half as smart as I am on my best day on the training range due to the stress of a lethal encounter.  Fortunately, a ""half as good"" Four Weapons Combat Master is still miles above the average dirtbag predator on his best day."

It has the LWRCI Mark 1 ARM-R rail system and utilizes LWRCI’s patented short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The 5.45x39mm cartridge was developed as the Soviet’s answer to the American and NATO countries 5.56x45mm cartridge. It was chambered in their AK-74 rifles and it’s ballistics closely mirror those of our 5.56 round.

I have fired around 200 rounds through this gun and it's a pretty amazing weapon. The SR-22 is by far the best of the AR style 22's. It is solid and feels substantial in your hands. Extremely accurate and fun to shoot. 

I also have 2 hotlips 25 round magazines and an auto-loader which definitely takes the pain away from rapid firing 25 rounds and then having to reload. 

.22 ammo is dirt cheap and this has been a great friend at the range. I am purchasing a Saiga 12 gauge this weekend and I promised the girlfriend I wouldn't have too many guns in the house at one time. So, I think I am going to part with this gun. 

I have a little over $700 (actually probably closer to $800) invested in this gun if you include tax and background check. I purchased it at the shooter sports center in Racine WI. 

This gun is perfect for plinking, hunting small game, training someone who is new to guns, but it also looks pretty tough so you wont get any funny looks at the range."

Superior versatility in the high performance caliber 10mm: through reduced dimensions compared with the standard size Glock 20, the subcompact Glock 29 is also suitable for concealed carry. In addition to the use as backup weapon for hunting, more and more security personnel on patrol duty appreciate the comfortable firing characteristics and the grip ergonomics of the Glock 29 with a standard magazine capacity of 10 rounds."

(radiator holds fine no overheating etc.) power stearing leaks slowly I have to refill about every 2-3 months. not enough for me to bother replacing, the starter is missing a tooth or two on the flywheel causing it to slip occasionally maybee once a week if that, again not enough for me to justify replacing. the interior is mostly clean. the driver seat bracket is broken causeing it to lean to the right, it does not impair driving and not uncomfortable to drive with, its just there. and the headliner is out right now I was replacing and decided to go with a custom headliner, I orderd the fabric and never got it so its just bare metal right now. and finally someone installed a 6 disk cd player in the back half assed and it caused the sterio not to play. some body damage but hardly noticable unless your looking for it. a branch fell on the roof just over the driver door causing it to cave a little. door closes fine and no leaks, this caused the door to catch the fender when opening. the other thing is a little damage on the passenger rocker pannel that was there before I got it. I know it sounds like alot of bad but its a jeep not meant to be perfect and isnt a whole lot of money to fix everything. The good for the jeep is straight 6 auto tranny dana 35s are all funcioning perfect starts first crank everytime gaurenteed (unless the starter slips) only 136,xxx miles on the jeep which is really good for the year. the lift was done properly is fine doing 75 from tulsa to okc all day long with no death wobble at all. then can hit the trails to. the diffs lock in great everytime and 4x4 works like new! This is my baby and is my daily driver. would make a good trail rig, farm jeep, hunting rig, or good daily driver. Will make someone very happy I have disclosed everything there is to disclose I dont want you to be surprised when you see it, its better than a lot of vehicles on here where people just arent upfront with you and dont tell you whats really wrong with there car. not really looking for trade really, partial trade for a gun maybe we will see. please no scammers per your email will only be laughed at and possibly responded back to with hatemail. thanks again for looking.

It is the “Precision Operator” model, but I had it built on a standard height flat top instead of the lightened version with shorter rails. It has an 18”, 1:8 twist, stainless, bull barrel. The upper is attached to a factory built RRA lower with two stage trigger. It has a 2.5-16X42, Bushnell Elite 6500 scope, with DOA reticle, mounted in Burris XTR rings. 

This gun is very accurate and it runs right. I have not had any problems with it. I just have the idea that I want something different. I will trade the entire gun (minus bipod), the gun minus the scope, or just the upper, with or without the scope. For now I want to keep any trades FTF in SC. I am in the Lowcountry, and I am willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet. I have included links to all of the components for pricing reference. It would cost about 2 thousand dollars to duplicate this gun at retail prices. I am putting the trade value at $1600. I can trade up or down for partial value trades.
I don’t really know exactly what I do want, but here are some ideas. If you want try me on something else, fine. Thanks for looking.
