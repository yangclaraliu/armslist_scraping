The only reason I'm selling/trading this is because I'm getting out of the .45acp because of hand problems (arthritis) and switching to all 9mm handguns.

Up for sale or trade is a very hard to find 3/4 Straight Cut Dust Cover Rail, model number PX9105ML not PX9105MLP.  This thing is a tack driver and extremely accurate.  They only a made a few of these before they switched to the 1/2 rail currently found on Marine Core Operators.  It has had over $500 of gun smithing work done to it to polish and tighten everything up.  Trigger is match grade 3.5-4.5lbs pull that breaks like a glass rod.  I have smaller hands so I had a short reach trigger installed but it also comes with the original.  It also has a Wilson Combat GI Plunger kit installed instead of the FLGR.  It has had less than a 1,000 flawless rounds down the tube, never a jam or FTF.  I don't have the Crimson Traces grips for it (even though it is shown on the receipt).  I absolutely hate to get rid of it, but the 9mm is more comfortable to shoot.

I also have extra magazines, holsters and ammo for sale to the buyer.

Trades I'm looking for is anything tactical or cool.  Just try me

The date and eagle and U.S. Springfield are there and still very legible. This musket was actually a lamp found in the atic of an old house. The barrel is 36 inches long, cut down from 40. Has a hole in back by hammer where the light cord went through. And the butt plate was cut off and rear of stock flat to attach to the stand. It was coated in an aluminum paint which has been cleaned off. The lock plate and mechanisim work great, cocks, fires. Those parts alone I could sell on gunbroker or ebay for good money. The stock does have two cartouches but cannot see them very well on the left side. A shame she got cut up to make a lamp. But still a piece of our history that should be displayed on a wall and would do so very nicely. Soldiers would lighten their rifles by cutting the stocks down and barrels too during the civil war so there is no way of knowing if that was done then or by someone years later. There is a bead sight on the end of the barrel. So it was used after being cut down. Nice wall hanger and conversation piece that looks better this way than being a lamp for sure. Would trade for 22 rifles or pistols, ruger standard, mk1s, or other old military surplus pistols"

Amount paid varies on specific item, condition and the current market.

For example, if you purchased a new item for $500, but it is now used and in good condition. We may be able to get it from the factory or a distributor for $400, and 50% is usually knocked of the value of a used item, so we may offer you $200. But, if there is very little market for the item and we cannot turn it around quickly, then we may offer less or even say that it is not something we are interested in at this time. However, certain items retain their value much better than others. We have paid up to 90% of retail before. You will just have to check with us for an estimate.

This gun was sold exclusively through K-Mart stores in the late 90s.
 But whatever these little shotguns are branded, they are extremely well made with a very simple, safe, and functional design.
 This 'MARLIN 200' has a beautifully colored case hardened receiver, a nicely blued barrel, and the metal to wood fit is awesome.
 This gun is like brand damned new, & rock solid! It would make a great huntin' gun for a newer shotgunner or a perfect little spare for an experienced shooter that just wants to 'simply' shoot stuff wthout fiddling with knobs, dials, & switches.
  These little guns are All American Made & have great reviews.
 The OAL of the Barrel is 27.5"", is chambered for 12 Ga. shells up to 3"", and it has a Modified Choke. 
 There is a transfer bar mechanism to prevent the dreaded 'hammerslip' which is also a very nice feature.
 I will take cash, but if you come up with a better idea- I'd love to hear about it.
 If you're looking for a great single shot 12 ga. 'Pardner', here is a like new example. And the best part is, it's a MARLIN, or at least that's what it says."

Custom built AR 15 semi auto rifles.  Please email us for custom builds.  Sky Guns International specializes in custom built tactical and hunting weapons.

It has the following features:

•M15SA lower receiver made from aircraft grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging same as currently used by US military,
with 16"" inch M4 contour barrel and A3 Upper receiver 

 •M4 Feed Ramp barrel extension

 •T-Marked forged upper receiver

 •1-11"" twist, 6 grooves, right hand twist

 •11595E Barrel steel Manganese Phosphate finish barrel

 •This 6.8 SPC caliber SPEC II  barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer

 •The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports M4 contour and length handguards with full heat shields, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function

 •The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel

 •This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection

 •These barrels are of Mil-spec M4 contour (.750 under the front sight base) complete with the M203 groove in the front

 •This contour is the perfect balance between light weight, heat dissipation, and accuracy

 •The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 11"" twist

 •The 1/11"" twist is best for this caliber because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights

 •The barrel is mounted on a FORGED A3 upper receiver with built in Mil-spec M1913 Picatinny accessory rail, with the correct rail numbers engraved, made from certified forgings, hardcoat anodized IAW Mil Spec A8625, Type III, Class II, black per No. 37038, Table IX with nickel acetate seal, as per the Mil-spec

 •The upper features a forward assist and hinged ejection port cover

 •The buttstock tube is the mil spec thickness (1.145"" OD) M4 buttstock (not the cheaper carbine buttstock)

 •This buttstock features 6 positions for maximum shooter comfort, reinforced honeycomb design for heavy duty use

 •MADE IN USA!

 •Warranty: 1 year warranty against manufacturer defect.

I have a 1937 S/42 Mauser made German Luger in 9mm. This gun is COMPLETELY original with ALL matching numbers (small parts, grips, etc) and yes I even have the original magazine with the matching numbers and stamp as well. As you can see for yourself this gun is in amazing condition, and surpasses the quality of most I have seen.  The gun also comes with another magazine and an authentic Luger holster made in 1940. Just remember this gun is like a classic hot rod, you won't be able to go out and just find them, and good examples like mine only appreciate in value every year, and are becoming harder and HARDER to find, all the stockpiles and secret caches are gone and most of the surviving pieces are mismatched numbers, don't have all the original pieces, or look like they were dragged behind a truck for miles. 
DO YOUR HOMEWORK please before offering me, these things go around $1500 in half the quality of what I have, look at all the sites and speak to people, with all matching numbers, the original magazine, and in this condition most people ask between $2000-$2500 as this is the Mauser made S/42 that is the sought after model and the one I have is what every collector looks for in every aspect (condition, quality, desirability).

Don't be afraid to shoot me an offer I am looking for a Springfield M1A (I will trade straight across for any model M1a) , AR-10's, AK's, long distance shooters (308's with bull barrels, etc) quality handguns (sig sauer, springfield xdm, etc) or even a trained bird dog, or a couple good pupppies to train myself. these are some ideas of things I am looking for, but as always I am open to trades and offers just let me know what you have, and the worst I will say is no.  If you prefer to just purchase it that is fine, just shoot me a reasonable offer and we will talk her out.  Thank you

In closing, please ONLY SERIOUS INQUIRIES I am a military man and a single father, I have no time to waste and would appreciate it if you are unsure to just wait to contact me until you are sure, thanks."

I fired a few shells through it to make sure that it shoots. Other than that, this hasn't seen the light of day since the mid 1970's.

SOLD  SOLD  SOLD  SOLD
Here is an unfired FEG AK47 7.62 x 39  As you can see it has the thumbhole stock and adjustable iron sights. It comes with 4 brand new durable Tapco polymer 30 round magazines that snap in nice and tight. That will give you the capability for 120 rounds of sustainable firepower in dire circumstances. This one did have a chip in the stock that was glued before I got it. There is a close-up picture and it will not affect the operation.
 I have owned several AK47s over the years and they are still the most dependable and durable weapons for SHTF situations. I am sure these rifles and magazines are the first on Hillary's list to ban. I decided to put one up for sale before that happens. Better get one while you still have an opportunity. I can still do a face to face sale in Iowa if you show ID and shipping to an FFL in most states is about 35.00.

I do not need to sell it and it will only increase in value so the price is firm. I may also trade for a 8-10k generator. The magazines alone may be worth the asking price very soon. 

If you voted for a Liberal I will not sell this to you for any price. Maybe you can trade your Obama phone or birth control for one somewhere else. Many Americans died in wars to protect our freedoms and you have blasphemed them. My vote and my principles will never be for sale.
 Thank You so much to all veterans!
