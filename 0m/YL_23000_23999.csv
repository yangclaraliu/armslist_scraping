It's still perfectly funtional, just shows mostly duty-wear. It's a 50's production, I believe, so it's an older pistol. This revolver is pretty much an Argentenian knock-off of a Smith&Wesson service revolver from back in the 50's. 
Like I said, it's perfectly functional, just not the prettiest thing to look at. Good cheap revolver to have floating around your house for that rainy day someone comes knockin you don't want around.
DO NOT SHOOT +P LOADS! This pistol was made before those loads came around, and it will not handle them. Shoot only .38 special standard loads.

Update i have dropped my price on this by 25 bucks for either option. i will NOT take any less than 250 for this gun. i have had people ask me about the condition of the bluing. yes the bluing is starting to come off but there are NO rust spots at all on this gun and bore is superb. for 7 bucks you can reblue this gun if you want and if you are good it will look great done it before with other rifles. i can understand if you dont want the scope so the option is available. to compare if you bought this rifle you will save almost 150 bucks on a new one if you can find it. this gun shoots great and like i said i will through in 15 rounds of 30-30 ammo with the gun if you buy it regardless of scope or not. thank you"

I left the factory 5 round clip at the range (yea i lost it) so it has no magazine, but these are sold everywhere.  You can just buy an 8 or 12 round magazine instead.  I would like $700 cash for it.  

19 inch barrel, takes 2 3/4 and 3 inch.  Has 3 holes drilled into the barrel where the gas piston is (this is good, means its not the cheaper vodka specials floating around). 

Cycles nicely, just needs a magazine.   You can shoot the 100 round federal target load bundle for $20 at walmart (best deal around) on the magnum setting (1 setting that is), which not all saigas can do (most cycle it on 2nd setting).   I never had to switch to the 2nd setting for the cheaper target load ammo.

This saiga will not cycle the cheap winchester target loads, from what i hear not many saigas will.  My remington 870 even has problems with that cheap ammo. 

If your interested then shoot me an email for pics."

It was created off of a custom order in which several concerns where addressed with some styling of holsters.  

Its sleek contours and beautiful accented rivets are just part of what makes this holster appealing.  Front piece is made from choice pick of leather to give it just the right feel and texture.  The back piece is designed and chosen from only the thickest of bull leather, to give it stability and years of wear.  Finally on the backside of the holster is a belt loop system designed with care to accommodate any belt thick or thin.  

The major key points of the holster are all centered around design, comfort and reliability.  It is high enough and tight enough to be worn under a simple shirt without printing.  Sturdy and fitted well to provide countless years of  wear and tear.  The major factor is the comfort.  With a high rising back to protect from sweat and oils from the body and also to serve as a protection for the body.  No more sitting down and feeling the press of a hammer or beaver tail pushing against your side.  

The holster is available in our store, as well as any gunshows we attend.  We are able to ship, provided we have a mold of your weapon on hand, and if not we are always willing to go the extra mile and do a custom fitting directly to your weapon.  

We provide custom holster, custom duty belts, accessory holsters and more.  Have something in mind?  We can make it happen!

It is a little more pistol than I want. It comes with 498 rnds of ammo. I will trade it straight across for a Colt 380 cal Mustang plus 2. I will consider other Colts as trade."

Has minor surface scratches which is very common on these type pistols (the surface shows them easily, hence many users duracoat them for more cosmetic appeal).

It is actually an Indian made Ishapore 2A, with a sporter stock.  The Ishapore factory has been making Lee Enfields since 1904, and in the 1960's they started making them of strengthened steel to handle the new NATO cartridge.  When I bought this rifle I had my father in law go over it as he is a retired British Army Armourer and is intimately familiar with the Lee Enfield no.1 design.  

Lee Enfield rifles are one of the two best bolt action battle/military rifles of the twentieth century.  The other one being the Mauser 98.  The Mauser is stronger and heavier but the Lee Enfield is faster to operate and smoother.  They are both ultimately reliable.  My father in law checked the headspace and everything else in the action of the gun and told me it needed a new bolt head and a few other parts.  I ordered the parts and he put them in and it is ready for duty, as a hunting rifle or maybe to be made up into a scout rifle.  The headpsace is like a new rifle. The bore is good and the rifle extracts ejects and fires fine.  It is an accurate rifle as well.  I only have a 100 yard range at my gun club and I am not a very good shot, but I was able to get groups within a couple of inches at 100 yards, and this is with the iron sights. 

This rifle comes with a ten round removeable magazine, and I also have another aftermarket magazine that comes with it.  These rifles will shoot any 7.62NATO ammunition as well as any commercial reduced recoil .308 ammo, such as made by Remington or Federal.  

I will sell this for $275.00, and the price is not negotiable.  If we meet up and you check it out and you decide you don't want it that's fine, but if you show up just to make a lowball offer then we have both wasted our time. Thanks and all the best to you."

Painted black for turkey hunting, with a ported Polychoke that has an extra-full setting.  

You can also dial back the Polychoke to cylinder bore for slugs.  

I had a pair of rifle sights added to this barrel by my gunsmith, and it is an accurate shooter out to about 50 yards.  The bore is excellent, except for a spot at the end which was etched by some bluing solution back some time ago.  This does not affect the operation.  

I am also including an 18 inch cut down barrel that goes on this gun so when you are not hunting with it, it can serve double duty as a home defense weapon. 

The Ithaca model 37 feeds and ejects from the bottom of the receiver and is an extremely reliable shotgun.  The best thing aout the bottom feed/eject feature is when you are walking around in the rain and snow it does not have any openings in the top or sides so your chamber does not get wet inside.  This is not a fancy gun, just a working mans' double duty shotgun.  

I will sell this gun for $275.00 firm.  If we meet up somewhere and you decide that you don't want it, that's fine.  Just don't show up and make a lowball offer, you will only be wasting your time and mine. Thanks and all the best to you."

I have recently inherited an early 80's mark x Rifle, and unfortunately need to sell it. (The wife says that if i want a new gun this one has to go!) This gun was owned by a family member and was seldom used. in its near 30 year life, it has had 5 boxes of ammo run through it totaling 100 rounds fired. 

This is a very clean rifle and has few signs of wear. There is no damage to the rifle itself, but there are some blemishes to the bluing on the underside of the trigger guard from sitting on something. The stock still gleams and does have a few small indentations in the wood and a shallow scratch (all only visible close).

This rifle includes some ammo (about 27 rounds plus 11 fired brass for reloading) and a Bushnell banner 4x - 12x scope."

I had rifle sights and a ported Polychoke installed and the gun is painted balck for turkey hunting. The gun takes 2 3/4"" shells.   

The Polychoke has adjustable settings.  For turkey hunting you can dial it up all the way to extra full.  For shooting smoothbore slugs you can open the choke up to cylinder bore.

The barrel is in very good condition except for s spot near the end where it was etched by some bluing fliud that spilled in the muzzle.  It doesn't affect the function of the gun.  

This gun also comes with a cut down 18 1/2 inch barrel that you can install on the gun to keep it for home defense purposes.    

It is an accurate gun out to about 50 yards.  I like the Ithaca 37 action as it feeds and ejects from the bottom, for right or left handed shooters.  You can also sit or wander around all day in the rain and snow without worrying about moisture getting in you chamber.  It is a reliable action and this is a reliable gun.  It comes with a sling a recoil pad.  This is not a fancy gun, if the paint gets scratched it is easy to touch up.  

I will sell this shotgun for $275.00, firm.  If we meet up and you look at it and decide that you don't want it, that's fine.  If you show up just to make a lowball offer then you will have wasted your time and mine.  Thanks and all the best to you."

Ruby .38 special revolver. Pretty much an Argentenian clone of a Smith&Wesson service revolver. Production date is sometime around the 50's. This is an old pistol, but still shoots.

This was my grandfather's pistol. It had no sentimental value, so I am selling it. I personally have not fired it, as I don't have any .38, nor care to buy any. But I've seen my cousin fire this pistol a few years back, so it's perfectly functional. It's only really bad wear is the finish on the frame where it has obviously seen much use in a holster. 
DO NOT USE +P LOADS. This pistol will not be able to handle them. 

Comes with a generic belt holster.

The Blueing shows some wear in spots, as this rifle was used for hunting, but no rust.  The wood has some nicks in it as you would expect for something that has been hunting.  The bore is perfect, the gun hasn't seen very many rounds.  The gun is not in perfect shape, but is overall nice shape and has always been well cared for.  Buyer must be a Colorado resident over the age of 21 who can legally own firearms.  I will need to make a photo copy of your Colorado drivers license for my records if you purchase the gun.  I am open to offers and possible trades, I have several weatherby's and just don't need this particular one anymore."

AR-15_A1 Pre-Ban - Factory issue 5.56mm PWA Commando w/Colt barrel. This AR is not for everyone. It is a collectors item. There are a few people out there who understand what an early issue pre-ban is and understand my price for this AR. Serious inquiries only.

Upper: Colt 20-inch barrel 1:9 twist w/ bayonet lug. Barrel marked ""C MP Chrome Bore""; C for the manufacturer Colt, MP stamp means the barrel was magnafluxed and proofed, chrome bore and chamber. Bolt Carrier manufacturer stamp ""Shield (8 sided octagon) and SE""; Smith Enterprise. Bolt carrier group parts are in excellent shape; NO pitting, cracks, chips, scratches,  or scaring.

Lower: PWA (Pac West Arms, Milan, Ill.; this was the early LMT company I believe and Rock River Arms bought out PWA. From everything that I have heard they are excellent lowers!) 5.56mm Commando. This is a forged lower not cast.  Serial# 11,174. (PWA post-ban have a year prefix in the serial number. The serial # cutoff was 35,222 for preban status).

Standard two point sling and A1 stock w/ butt storage compartment.
Has a new AR-16 cleaning kit (Small Arms Maintenance Equipment Case 8465-00-781-9564). 
Have one USA 30 round AR-15 .223 magazine by O'Kay Industries, Inc., New Britain, Conn.

Just spent $144.00 at a gunsmith making sure this is in excellent working order. I had it fully serviced (new parts, fired & cleaned) by a gunsmith at Anderson's Gun Repair Shop here in Springfield, MO before putting it up for sale; new extractor spring & gas tube. I also run some 120 rounds through it and cleaned it. It was flawless.

I have a tactical Ruger 10/22 with a lot of upgrades. Here is the list of what it comes with. 

1. The rifle itself is a Ruger black synthetic semi-automatic Carbine with a Black Matte finish. 
2. One standard Ruger 10 round rotary clip 
MSRP is $277.00
http://www.ruger-firearms.com/products/1022Carbine/specSheets/1151.html

3. One 25 round Banana plastic Hot-lips clip (clear color).
MSRP is $19.97
http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/MAG412-36.html

4. Two 10 round Steel-lipped Hot-lips clips (clear color). 
MSRP is $16.12 + 16.12 = 32.24
http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/23973-36.html

5. Two 30 round regular clips. (smoke color)(These are okay but are NOT the best clips available). 
MSRP is $13.99 + 13.99 = 27.98
http://www.cactustactical.com/osc/eagle-international-round-1022-magazine-p-1826.html

6. Hot-lips speed loader. (It is a little fussy with the 30 round clips but it does work). 
MSRP is $24.59
http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/23975-1.html

7. Double-Muzzle Brake and Flash hider. This thing is always on backorder it seems and it took me about four months to get a hold of one that didn't cost more then 25 bucks. I'm only charging $19.97 like they sell it for.

9. RedHead Pursuit Deluxe Red Dot Sights with Multiple Reticle feature. There are four sight types; 5 MOA, 10 MOA, Cross Hair, and Circle X. I am not charging what this scope is worth because I bought it with a discount because the circle-x feature doesn't work. (For some reason it has completely filled with what ever light that the scope uses so there is no open space in the circle. The rest of the features work fine though, and have been for the past year. I never use any but the smallest dot anyway because if it's any bigger it becomes distracting and takes your eye off the target.) 
MSRP is $99.99

10. Leapers UGT Multi Function Universal Folding Bipod. I am leaving the adaptor on my 30-06 so just the bi-pod comes with the 22. Because of that, I'm taking $10.00 off the price.

11. Coleman flashlight that I mounted with weaver rails. (It shines at 115 Lumens and is made with an Aerospace grade aluminum body so it is light weight. It also runs off of AA Batteries so you don't need to buy those really expensive ones.)

14. A soft Read Head rifle case with a side pocket for gear. This thing is big enough to 
pack all the range gear you could ever need for a 22 rifle. I can't find it online but I know that I bought in at Walmart on sale for $15.00. It was regularly $25.00. I am selling it for $15.00. If you don't want it then I'll keep it and take $15.00 off of the price.

15. A swinging target system that resets itself, so no more getting up and taping more paper targets. That was always a real buzz kill for me!

 If you are local I'll give you a really good deal on some 22 ammo too. Price is FIRM! So DON""T lowball me! As you can see, there is $734.09 worth of gear. I'm not charging for the amount of time it took to get all of this stuff and install it. I am also taking off $34.09 because it is very slightly used. I've put less then 2,000 rounds through it and have cleaned it every time I brought it back from the range. If you want it, I'll throw in the rods and tips for cleaning as well. I have too much time, effort, and money invested in this to give it away at some ridiculously low price. It is a reliable weapon that is worth every penny that was put into it. If I can't get back out of it what I put into it then I won't sell it. I know that a lot of people say bigger is better in weapon size but with the current political situation who knows when it will become illegal to own those ""big"" guns. This type of rifle is a small enough caliber that it will be legal long after any other weapon. Thus, it is the perfect small game and survival gun. 
I reserve the right to close the sale at any time.
The buyer is responsible for all FFL fees and shipping fees.
If anybody is looking to trade, I am interested in AK's or a SKS but will consider any weapon. 

Thank you for looking!!!"

Description 
M500A
The SureFire M500A replaces the original handguards of your M4 or similar carbine. It features a 9-volt shock-isolated incandescent lamp with a 1.62"" reflector suited to close- to medium-range applications, and two low-output navigation lights available in white, red, or blue. Primary beam output is 125 lumens for one-hour of runtime using an MN10 lamp assembly (included) or 225 lumens for 20 minutes using an MN11 lamp assembly (included). The M500A has three primary beam switches integrated into the forend: a constant-on rocker switch (left side), a momentary-on pressure pad switch (right side), and a system-disable rotary switch (rear of battery housing) that locks all lights in the OFF position to prevent accidental activation during covert operations, transport, or storage. The navigation lights are operated by a smaller momentary-on pressure pad switch (left side). Proven in combat, used by military and law-enforcement around the world.

Magazine capacity: 5 rounds

French army was among the first to adopt the smokeless rifle ammunition in the form of 8mm Lebel cartridge in 1886. By the early 1920s this rimmed cartridge became obsolete, so French began to develop a more modern, rimless cartridge, more suitable for proposed lightweight machine guns. By the 1924 French army had the new 7.5mm cartridge, but this proved to be unsuccessful, and by the 1929 the updated version of the 7.5mm ammunition has been adopted as 7.5mm Cartouche Mle.1929C (7.5x54mm). By the same time, French also developed a lightweight machinegun, the MAC 1929. Initially, French tried to convert earlier 8mm Berthier rifles for new ammunition, but it was apparent that the new rifle is desirable for French infantry. In 1936 French military officially adopted the MAS Mle.1936 (MAS-36) bolt-action rifle, developed by the Manufacture D'Armes de Saint-Etienne. Later on, French forces adopted the modified paratrooper's version, known as MAS-36 CR 39. This version differed from basic rifle by the aluminum butt stock, which can be folded down and under the forend. This rifle served with French armed forces until the semi-automatic MAS-49 and MAS-49/56 replaced it in service during 1950s and 1960s. The MAS-36 rifle was in production up until the mid-1950s. The MAS-36 action also served as a platform for FR F-1 and FR F-2 sniper rifles, which are still in service with French Armed forces. Since 1951, some of MAS-36 rifles were converted or made into MAS-36/51 pattern, by adding the permanently attached grenade launchers and rifle grenade sights. Grenade launcher was attached to the muzzle of the gun, and was used to launch rifle grenades using special blank ammunition. Folding grenade sight was attached to the left side of the front sight base.

MAS-36 is a manually operated, magazine fed, rotating bolt action rifle. The rotating bolt has two opposing lugs, located at the rear of the bolt body. The bolt locks into receiver walls, the bolt handle is located at the rear of the bolt, and is bent forward for more comfortable operation. The square-shaped receiver is machined from steel, and contained integral magazine. Magazine is loaded using charging clips or single rounds, with clip guides machined into the receiver bridge. The wooden stock is made from two parts (butt stock and forend), both connected to the uncovered receiver. The spike-shaped bayonet is stored in the tube below the barrel in reversed position, when not in use. Diopter rear sight is located at the rear of the receiver, and marked from 100 to 1 200 meters in 100 meters increments. Probably the most noticeable feature of the MAS-36 is the lack of any manual safety - rifle was supposed to be carried with empty magazine, and loaded only before the actual combat.

The gun safe is not fire proof but I do have a little over $100 in it and its about 3 months old.
I will let it all go for the right hand gun with ammo. Would like a .40 or 9mm in S&W or Ruger P series (open to other brands just let me know what you have, just no sub compacts). I can show ID and LTC. May go full distance if holster and extra mag(s) are included in trade offer and you are less than 101 miles from Lynn IN. May also add a climber stand for right trade.

It is constructed of lightweight aluminum (save for chrome lining on the inside of the barrel), with fluting to save a lot of weight, it is noticably lighter than the factory barrel, while being much thicker to aid accuracy.  It has been shot just enough to be properly broken in, less than 50 rounds put down the pipe.  The only reason it is being sold is that I switched to using open match sights, and a longer barrel was chosen to increase sight radius.  Perfect for your target-.22 build.  Also lightweight and short enough to make a great and handy hunting rifle barrel.  Will sell for $150.

Also for consideration: 

The original 10/22 barrel that was bought on the stock rifle.  It is in used condition, and completely functionally sound.  I will sell it for $40.

Lastly, the original optic I had mounted to the rig (pre-match sights).  It is a Tasco 6-24x42 duplex scope, with adjustable focus and parallax.  Comes with low-sitting Leopold scope mounts.  Great for smallbore benchrest shooting, or larger-bore long-range shooting in general.  Asking $50, and will make package deals if you are interested in multiple/all items listed."
