For more information on the AR57 setup, check out their website at www.57center.com. Economic realities are forcing me to consolidate calibers, so this upper has to go. I have fired exactly 50 rounds (one box) through this upper...it is absolutely in brand-new condition. The upper will come in the original box with the original AR57 buffer...everything is included per new. In addition, I'm including 2 brand-new in-box genuine FN P90 50 round magazines. These are not the cheap Korean copies, these are the real-deal FN magazines (I paid $70 each, price tag is still on the boxes). I've also got 2 boxes (100 rounds) of FN blue-tip ammo that are included. I'll also include a Magpul PMAG in foliage green that has been hollowed-out and sanded down to use as a spent cartridge collector. The AR57 ejects cartridges down through the magwell of your lower, so this customized PMAG will hold a full 50 spent cartridges.  Lastly, I'll include a Spike's Tactical pistol buffer tube and end-plate.  This is basically an entire AR57 12"" pistol + ammo, all you need to supply is an AR15 lower and buffer spring.

Note that one of the images below shows this upper on my SBR. This is just to show you what the unit looks like on an AR15 lower....I am not selling a complete rifle, only the upper as shown in the other photos and the accessories described above (Spike's Tactical pistol buffer tube is not pictured, but included). Nothing else from the rifle photo is included in this sale.  Also note that all NFA rules apply with this upper.

Also for the right trade I'll include my Glock 19.  This G19 has approximately 500 rounds through it, and is in perfect shape.  The Glock is bone-stock with the exception of new night sites installed.  The night sites are about 6 months old, so the tritium is very bright and in great shape for years to come.  The Glock comes as pictured, in the original hard case with 2 15 round magazines and the magloader, per new.

Here's what I'm looking for:

For the 57 setup alone, I'm looking for an Aimpoint T1 or M4 with a LaRue mount.

For the 57 setup and G19 together, I'll accept an Eotech (AA battery model) or older Aimpoint (PRO, M2, M3) AND a decent 1911 (Kimber, Colt, etc....no low-end Rock Island or similar).

I am not interested in any AKs.  Other than that, let me know what kind of trade you'd be willing to make, and we'll see what we can work out."

Overall, pretty decent shape. I've had this shotgun for years, and it has been an excellent shooter (bird shot, buck shot, and slugs). I enherited it 8 years ago from the origonal owner who purchased this new back in the mid 80s. This gun has been cleaned and oiled every time it's been shot, and once every few months it's been sitting in the safe. The gun is about 25 years old, so the blueing is not in ""perfect shape"", but overall this gun has aged well over the years. This gun has been a pleasure to shoot and own...excellent hunting / home defense weapon.

This shotgun is made in Brazil by CBC and imported by FIE (as per the stamp on the barrell). I have not fired this shotgun at all. It's been a hand-me-down gun which I aquired 2 years ago (2 previous owners and the person who gave it to me, had never shot it either). It is in decent shape...no serious rust, and the wood is in decent shape. It is very light-weight and would make a good hunting shotgun or to keep around as a collector's item.

This gun is in great shape and has trijicon night sights installed.  The gun has less than 500 rounds on it and was a primary carry piece for a few months before it went back to safe duty.  I maintain all of my firearms in top condition especially the ones I carry. There has been some trigger work to smooth out the pull and the gun is a real pleasure to shoot. I have the original case; two magazines; small, medium, and large back straps.  I will include 40 rounds of 165gr Speer Gold Dot ammo (~$45 value) and a galco IWB holster (pictured).

This is one popular and excellent shotgun. This IS NOT the A1 and it IS NOT the basic 500 model. It shoots great and funtions flawlessly. It was painted by the previous owner who had a love for OD/Tan colored weapons. This can easily be painted back to the origonal 'black' color or left as-is (the color grew on me, so I left it as it is now).

Along the Front Sight ramp theres 4 holes laser cut into the barrel like Magnaport does but IMHO this porting job works better than magnaport as i've owned several magnaported guns and a few ported in this style. first it actually works. Holes are cut up for muzzke jump and makes it very controlable, Second its cut angular to the rear to help with at least 40% of the recoil. She has a set of S&W Presentation Grips selling at gunshows for 150. For large hands like mine thet feel great and really do help with the recoil and control. There has also been trigger work before I bought it. single action feels like 1 1/2 lbs and double action is smooth and light like it was rolling on bb'a its glass smooth and this gun is intrinsically very accurate. Reach me at REDACTED or REDACTED. I will also give 200 rounds of quality ammo with this gun and more if nessesary like Speer Gold dot Hornady HP-XTP, Magtech etc. will even take the buyer to the range to verify what has been said of this Revolver"

Its in decent shape (has some chips in the blueing and wear in the blueing around the edges of the gun), but is in perfect firing condition. It has never misfired while using quality ammo, and the misfires i have had with it firing cheap bulk ammo were very rare (Probably only 2 or 3 times in the couple hundred rounds I have put through the gun). It is a really neat little gun that is fun to shoot, and would make a good pocket pistol for someone whose summer dress wont accomodate anything larger. It comes with the orginal box.

Up for ( SALE or TRADE ) Is an excellent to like new in the box condition, Is a rarer and hard to come by RUGER P90-DC decock only model 45acp pistol, This pistol has only had a couple magazine run threw it since it was bought new, It has also had the grips upgraded to a set of Uncle Mikes textured soft neopreme rubberized grip, For a better grip retention against sweat and moisture unlike the factory plastic ones, It also come with two ( 2 ) factory magazines, A factory hardshell carrying case, And a factory manual...

The Ruger P90DC decock only model was only made for a couple of years, And only in a limited number of lots from the factory, So these models have been harder and harder to come by, Making them rarer and rarer to get a hold of, Especially one that is in excellent to like new condition, So my asking price is $550 OBO on this piece for straight up cash, Or $600 dollars if you are wanting to do some horse trading...

I believe this means that at least the receiver was made in ""Gustloff Werke, Werk Wiemar, Weimar"". The reason why I say that is because some of serial numbers on the bolt do not match, like so many other Mauser's in circulation. However, the entire rifle works flawlessly and the only missing piece would be a front sight hood. Since it has been in my possession, I have cleaned off all the grease and have shot up to about 40 rounds of 8mm. It is nice shooter and a great piece of history...if you don't mind the swastikas. This particular rifle has two swastikas, one on the receiver and one on the side of the barrel. There is also an ""x"" marked next to one of the swastikas which I think means this was Russian capture. Another spooky discovery I made with this rifle was a spot of dried blood on the inside of the handguard. Of course it could be some clumsy gunsmith's blood who cut himself or it could be from conflict. There is no real way to tell, but it certainly adds character to this rifle.

With the rifle I will also include several stripper clips that each hold five 8mm rounds. These insert at the top of the magazine like normal and also pop off when you close the bolt...if you can do it right."

The gun holds 6 rounds, 5+1. Comes with the 18.5 inch barrel. Blue finish with black synthetic stock. I have removed the original stock and installed an ATI rear pistol grip. The original stock will be included. I also have an ATI forend pistol grip as well. I am including both ATI installation instructions as well as the remaining accessories. I also will be throwing in a laser mount for the gun, 8 new batteries, and the laser. The laser seems to be defective, however, I just purchased it new off of ebay so maybe you will have better luck with it than myself. I am also including approximately 100+ buckshot rounds and 20+ slug rounds. It also has a fiber optic site installed. The gun is in great shape and has less than 50 rounds through it.

I am looking to trade for a handgun. I am looking preferably for a 9mm or a .45acp, however, will also entertain .40 offers. I will listen to all offers, worse I can do is say no. I prefer to do a straight trade, though I might accept a gun plus cash.

I am in Jackson County which is about an hour south of Indy and an hour north of Louisville. I will only do FTF and prefer not to drive across the state, though for the right deal anything is possible. For those of you in the Northern part of the state I will be in the Elkhart area towards the end of July.

Long story short, it makes me nervous. So I am going either 5.56x45 or 7.62x39. To that end, I'm selling this rifle.

It is a Century Arms 'M74', their AK-74. For those who don't know, the barrel isn't chrome lined. Otherwise it is a straight shooter, I've confirmed that the gun does not keyhole, and the 'bullet-muzzle' test has shown about 1/8"" between the case and the muzzle, so the bore is definitely 5.45mm. I cannot speak to accuracy as this was the first gun I ever shot and still had trouble with the irons on my last outing to the range.

The condition is good. This rifle came from Century with great parkerizing, and except for the areas in front of the HG retainer and the sling loop it's still pretty good. (see pics). The wood is a little off, I tried refinishing the handguards, which came-out so-so, and the Buttstock still had original Bulgarian shellac. I can strip and re-shellac the buttstock if desired. I can include the original ugbug plastic Century put on it, but for some reason the original upper HG is loose (wood and polyamide still tight)

The bore is in great shape, I've been meticulous (read: anal retentive) about keeping it clean after shooting. The bore is shiny with clear rifling and no pitting. Have shot about 200 rounds through it.

Some accessories were bought for the rifle. Polish sling, mag pouch, bipod, and steel magazine. Including a K-var 5.56/5.45 buttstock cleaning kit and half a bag of bore patches. Also included is 270+ rounds of 7N6 ammunition and the original 4 C10/C21 magazines.

Fore-notice, any potential exchange will include presentation of ID and signature of a bill of sale/receipt."
