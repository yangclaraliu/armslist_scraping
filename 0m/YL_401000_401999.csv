This is a very neat law enforcement only shotgun that was way ahead of it's time.  It was put into service for SWAT and LEO in the mid 1960's but still very capable today!  It has a built in carry handle as well as a flashlight built into the handle.  I was able to get the light to work and I can show you how.  To work like original it may need a few new parts.  

It reads on the side:

It is legal length with an 18.25"" barrel and a total length of only 26"".  This is a very rare piece of law enforcement history.

Magpul MS2 Multi Mission Single Point Two Point Sling - Black - Magpul

Driven by the operational experience of Magpul Dynamics instructors, the MS2™ Multi-Mission Sling System was designed to give a versatile weapon-retention solution for a multitude of tactical environments and missions. As a standalone product, the rapidly-convertible MS2™ allows an operator to leverage the maneuverability of single-point® attachment for direct-action, or two-point attachment for stability. Single-hand adjustments, quick-detach lanyard and positive-locking metal hardware provide flexibility and durability in a truly adaptable sling system.

The MS2 enables seamless transitions into an array of shooting positions without getting bound or fouled. The MS2 concept allows switching from Weapon Shoulder to Reaction Shoulder for shooting around corners, under vehicles, or to minimize exposure. The MS2™ can also increase operator survivability by keeping the weapon in the fight in case of injury to the operator's shoulder, arm, or hand.

The concept is simple: Your survivability rate dramatically increases if your gear allows you to move freely in a dynamic environment."

It has an M4 style 6 position stock with a pistol grip for a handle with built in finger grooves. installed on the stock is a buttpad specifically for that stock and a six shell holser made specifically foe that stock.

The pump or forrend part of the gun has been converted to a pistol grip that allows for steady shooting and a better more natural_ hold of the gun.

I am seeling my Huglu U4E Over/Under Shotgun. This gun was crafted and designed by Mark Dehaan of Dehaan Shotguns. If you would like to know how well these guns are made and the craftmanship that goes into them then please go to www.dhshotguns.com and read all about the process its VERY WELL MADE!
This model is the U4E Sport model which sells new for around $1500.00 then there are all of the extras that this gun has! Mark Dehaan and I have spoken over numerous emails and he has told me that this was one of his nicest guns and most expensive, but now with the economy and things I have to part with one of my favorite guns of all time, YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE HOW NICE THIS GUN IS. 
A man once told me that a Huglu from Dehaan was the nicest gun that you have never heard about and he was so right!
I will list all of the specs of the gun below, and please look at all the photos as they are of the exact gun you will purchase.

Barrel length is 30""
Barrel are matte finish (so nice)
Ported barrels ($250)
Screw in choke system with 2 Chokes 
Auto Ejectors ($299)
Palm Swell (fits hands very nice)
Adjustable Comb ($295)
Adjustable safety switch at the thumb
Butt plate pad
And the hand engraved side plates which are so NICE!

This over under is built extremely well and if you can find anyone who has actually had one they are often compared to Berretta style. You will not find a better over under for the price and craftmanship that goes into these!
I would love to answer any questions you have, and I will entertain all serious offers.
I would prefer to meet up in person and do the sell that way but if the buyer needs it shipped to an FFL I will be happy to do this but at the buyers expense. All shipping and final pricing can be negotiated to make the deal.
Thank You and buy with confidence you will not be disappointed."

It’s a sig 522 .22lr with a 20” blued bull barrel has a 3-postion stock/folds sideways also. I have 2-25rd mags and 2-30rd mags with this price I am including all four mags and two optics one is a slightly used Tasco Red Dot With 11 brightness settings and a Center 1x25mm multi-TAC Sight has (4) Different crosshair options Red/Green.  The rifle in my opinion is the best one I’ve owned and I have a Ruger 10/22 (NOT FORSALE) just a reference. Back to the sig the date on the box it was made is 6-MAR-2012 I don’t shoot any High cost ammo I use Federal Bulk 550 from wal-mart and it shoots perfect and when its sighted in its quite accurate meaning I sighted it in at 16 yds and it was hitting center in a ¼ inch round sticker round after round now that’s with the tasco red dot I have yet to sight in the center point or even really use it I had it on the sig at one point but never got around to sight it in so I took it off, also the gun does not have iron sights it did when I bought it but they weren’t good at all so I got rid of them. I’m asking about $535ish I think that should get me the gun I want. Also I’m interested in any firearm trade (please no pistols) I don’t care for pistols I prefer rifles now also I like semi auto rifles but I think it would be neat to own a bolt action that has iron sights on it.

I am selling a barely used Loaded Springfield Operator in almost new condition.  The gun has only been to the range a couple of times and shows almost no wear.  The finish is in excellent condition.   The mainspring housing has been changed out (the original is included).  Safety is single sided.  I hate to see this one go as it is one of my favorites - when you rack the slide's it's like they are moving on glass (selling because I need money for a business I am starting).  This is one of the best built Springfields I have seen and they can be pretty hard to find.  Here are the specs from Sringfields Site:

The Springfield Armory® operator pistol was the first pistol offered by a major 1911 manufacturer having a light-mounting rail forged directly into the frame. While others have followed our lead, we still offer the most comprehensive line of 1911 light-rail guns available. The Standard Picatinny mounting platform readily accepts the most popular whitelight and laser illumination devices used by military spec-ops and law enforcement tactical teams. These fully-capable extreme-duty firearms are truly the best of the best.

600 - Winchester pre 64 model 94 in Winchester Special 32. Not original blueing. Comes with antique box of ammo made by Dupont. (Was told by collector the ammo alone is worth 150) Great shooter, and wood is in good shape. Great for deer, could use for elk up to 300 yards.

SOLD ****400 - Weatherby .308 with scope. Good shape, and I was getting .42 inch MOA @ 100 yards. Great all around gun. Comes with hard case. Was going to be my elk gun, but was replaced....

350 - Taurus Tracker in .22 7 shot revolver. This thing is a beast! It shoots amazing, and would be a great way to teach your kids gun safety, or fun plincking/trail gun. Have size 30-32 leather belt holster for it, for an extra 25 bucks.

This is for the FrogLube 4oz kit Containing 4oz LIQUID, 4oz PASTE, Microfiber Cloth, and Applicaton Brush. We usualy ship Next day! FrogLube is a revolutionary bio-based gun cleaner, lubricant and preservative (CLP) product made from food-grade ingredients all obtained exclusively from US suppliers. It is a new “green” product developed for government use by San Diego-based Audemous, Inc, a company that evaluates products in the emerging environmental, safety and health sector. FrogLube was founded by CAPT Larry Lasky, US Navy SEAL (ret), who spent the past 32 years in service to the United States Special Operations Command, Naval Special Warfare and to the U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines whose gallant performance he attributes to every success on any mission and on any battlefield he has served. After a career of uncounted operations in every environment from jungle, to arctic, to maritime and desert, he’s seen the impact of these extremes on weapons and equipment. He felt the best equipment, products and weapons always came from combining the most arduous conditions and the solutions created by the world’s best field “operators”. He’s taken this ethos into product development with FrogLube, a new technology lubricant designed to replace inferior and toxic petroleum-based products that foul actions, attract carbon and stick to dirt and grime. CAPT Lasky’s experiences involved shooting or deploying troops who shot hundreds of thousands of rounds in every conceivable extreme environmental and tactical condition. In his experience, stoppages, missfeeds, fouling-caused malfunctions occur way too frequently and an area often overlooked became the source of his quest to develop FrogLube.

The 50,000 Volt TASER® Advanced M26-C provides an effective non-lethal alternative to hand guns. It is known worldwide for its tremendous take down power. TASER® devices are the preferred choice of many professionals, yet are available for purchase by regular citizens. TASER® devices use proprietary technology to incapacitate dangerous subjects who pose a risk in a manner that is generally recognized as a safer alternative to other uses of force. TASER® technology saves lives every day. The TASER® Advanced M26-C utilizes compressed nitrogen to project two small probes 15 feet at a speed of 180 feet per second. These probes are connected to the TASER® device by high-voltage insulated wire. A 50,000 volt electrical signal (same voltage as the military and law enforcement versions) is transmitted throughout the region where the probes make contact with the body or clothing, resulting in an immediate loss of the person's neuromuscular control, balance and the ability to perform coordinated actions. TASER® devices are not considered firearms. They can be legally carried (concealed or open) in most states. TASER® devices are prohibited for citizen use in six states including HI, MA, NJ, NY, RI & MI (legal for bail agent, private investigator, or properly trained aircraft pilot or crew in MI).

I got it because I got my carry and conceal permit and the truth is, I just never carry it enough to have it. It comes with a Galco Summer Comfort holster, tan in color, and a black, I believe blackhawk, cloth holster. Both holster's are in perfect condition and are IWB. It also comes with 50 rounds of ammo. It's not expensive ammo but it comes with it. This gun has never been shot. I bough it brand new from Superior Pawn and Gun right after tax time. I will throw in everything that I have for the gun.
