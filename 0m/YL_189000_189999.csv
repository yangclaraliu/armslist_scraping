6,http://www.armslist.com/posts/189006,"For Sale:  U.S. Percussion Rifle, Model 1841 - Remington Contract ""Mississippi"" Musket - Percussion","Denver, Denver, Colorado",$ 900,"Listed On: Monday, September 5, 2011",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Model 1841 Remington Contract ""Mississippi"" Rifle - rifling is faint but is the 7-groove rifling.  Flayderman Guide grades this gun as Fair condition.

M1841 ""Mississippis"" saw heavy usage by both Confederates and Union soldiers in the early part of the Civil War--usually by state units--but their popularity declined as more 1861 Springfields were manufactured and issued. 

The rear notch sight is intact, and all brass furniture, including barrelbands, triggerguard, sideplate and butt box are intact as is the front sight.  Ramrod is of the Civil-War era full-iron replacement variety, as many of the brass-headed ramrods were removed due to metal separation issues in battle.  Butt-mounted brass patchbox lid hinge is sturdy, patchbox has a compartment for bullet patches, nipple wrench/screwdriver tool, worm and spare percussion nipple.  Brown barrel lacquering (original) is evident in large places along the 33 inch barrel.

Stamped marks on the brass buttstock read ""J"" over top of a ""13"".  There are two oval cartouches stamped into the wood on the opposite side from the lock to the rear of the brass curled lockplate on that side.  To the rear of the hammer on the lock is stamped ""US 1849"", and in front of the hammer, a very faint ""Remington's"" with some unintelligible stamping below that.

I believe that the very front of of the stock - muzzle end - of the rifle is a piece of replacement wood, although it looks to be a period replacement.  Front brass barrel band is slightly loose due to the lack of humidity in Colorado (rifle is from Pennsylvania).

Asking $900 due to condition and piece of replacement wood (I believe) in stock, or best reasonable offer.  Face-to-face, cash transactions only.  Rifle can be seen at my pub (Scruffy Murphy's Irish Pub, 2030 Larimer Street) by appointment only - please contact me via message through Armslist to arrange."

95,http://www.armslist.com/posts/189095,For Sale:  Leupold Mark 4 CQ/T Scope,"Southwest Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma",$ 750,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 28, 2011",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a new Leupold Mark 4 CQ/T scope for sale.  The scope is variable from a true 1 power for close-in work to 3 power for hitting a few blocks away with complete accuracy!  

The Mark 4 CQ/T 1-3x14 is a simple, rugged and compact sighting system that is ideal for long-range hunting, law enforcement and military. The magnification of 2x and 3x in this Leupold rifle scope gives you a clear and accurate view of your target. The Mark 4 CQ/T 1-3x14 has a DiamondCoat lens coating that protects your lens from dust and scratches. You get eleven illumination settings that help you to match all lighting conditions. The Multicoat 4 coating offers utmost light transmission to give you remarkable brightness.

It is mounted to a LaRue Tactical LT-106 mount, which if you look at the picture you can see is MUCH beefier than the factory mount!  I mounted it to my rifle but never fired it before I decided to go a different direction.  The mount alone costs $150!  Check it out here:

http://www.skdtac.com/LaRue_CQT_Mount_QD_p/lrt.310.htm

This is the new version, 67670, with the RED reticle that is easy to see in all situations, not the yellow reticle that is easy to lose in a bright background.

This scope was in a recent article in Guns magazine where they had this to say, ""Leupold's Mark 4 CQ/T has a cult-like following among some serious operators, especially those who splash around in salt water.""  Nice, huh?

It comes with pop-up lens covers both front and back, and I put ladder-style covers on all the Picatinny rails, too.  If you want more information on the scope, you can visit Leupold's website:

Anyways here is my main reason for posting

First of all to the 99.9% of people on this list this post is not for
you because you post a fair price an asking price or atleast a
ballpark if you are looking for offers.  EVERYONE ELSE THIS IS FOR
YOU!!!!!!!!

1.  IF YOU DO NOT LIST A PRICE OR LIST AN ITEM AT $1 YOU ARE A
DUMBASS.  If you want offers indicate a ballpark in the post or list a
price in the post title and indicate OBO.

2.  DO NOT POST A PRICE THAT IS WHAT IT COST YOU.  Everything
depreciates, get over it and list a reasonable price.  The guns
drawing full new value are NIB from a dealer, antiques collector
items, or rare firearms.....(ie. your 700 dollar AR or AK is not
magically worth 1200 when it is bare bones stock)

3.  If you are not a dealer your gun is not NIB .......IT IS
USED!!!!!!  Price it like wise.  It may be unfired but no one cares it
is still used just not fired so it has depreciated less.   Don't say
that you bought it and didnt like it either that is BS why did buy it
to begin with.  If some one wanted to buy a NIB gun at a NIB price
they would go to any of the numerous retail stores available and buy
one.

4.  If you Dont list a price expect to be low balled!!!!!!!!!! For all
anyone knows you are desperate for money and need to sell quick, or
you have no idea the value.  No matter the reason if no price is
listed expect low offers because you didnt specify...don't get
offended just counter offer or reply with what you would like to get.
 BEST SOLUTION IS TO LIST A BALL PARK FIGURE!


AGAIN THIS POST IS AIMED AT IDIOTS THE MAJORITY OF USERS ARE GREAT,
LISTING REASONABLE PRICES AND MAKING GREAT POSTS"

 My trade interests are MAINLY compact Sigs (really want a 239)(no polymer sigs)
quality snubby 357 or 38s, nice 1911s, and possibly subcompact glocks.

I am willing to add cash for the right trade!!!

The stock is a Choate Ultimate Sniper stock, which takes the bite out of the .300 win mag recoil incredibly well, making this an easy to fire weapon. The downside is the weight, of course, but it's manageable. The stock has a Harris bipod attached. The scope is a Barska 8-32x50 with attached flip up/down scope covers. I have around $525 invested in the scope and stock alone. Comes with sling and carrying case as well. Hasn't been shot/used much. I am willing to negotiate the price within reason, and definitely open to trades and partial trades. I'm not interested in other hunting rifles though. The lone exception would be the Remington 700 bull barrel rifle (special purpose/sniper type) chambered in .308."

(again, just google it if you don't know what it is). It runs as fast as you can pull the trigger no matter what kind of ammo. Even the cheap stuff works great.

It has a quad rail with a forward grip and small bi-pod attached. The scope is a cheap ebay one that works but not super great. It also has an aftermarket dustcover with a rail mount on it. It comes with three magazines, one Inch and two Metric. The Inch one works perfect but the Metric ones are a little loose and can cause mis-feeds if your not carefull but work fine for playing at the range. Also comes with a leather pouch that holds two FAL mags if you want it. And last but not least, it comes with the hard case as well.

I did the custom camo paintjob. Did it wth quality paint and it has a real durable clear coat over it. If you don't like it you can easily paint it black in an afternoon but I get nothing but compliments on it. :)

If you have any questions feel free to ask. I didn't know a thing about these cool guns before I got one but I have grown to like them a lot. I don't really want to sell it but the money would help a lot right now.

I have fired less than 200 rounds in this thing!
It comes stock with a threaded barrel to accept any silencer or suppressor you may have. also accepts most any muzzle tips (flash hider, flash suppressors, muzzle breaks, bird cages) the barrel tip that is in some of the pictures, the one with the holes in it, does NOT come with this gun. i just bought it and want to put it on my rifle. I just put it in the picture to show how the threaded barrel. The reason I am selling this is because I am closing on my first house and wow lol now i need some fast cash. 

Fun and easy to shoot gun. This is a great deal to be coming with the red dot sight and the laser sight. the laser is dead on, shoot bulleseye from the hip, the red dot i never did get sighted in. I feel Im taking a pretty good hit on this but need the money and still feel this is a fair price.

I can meet you anywhere around Myrtle Beach/Conway area, can meet people from Wilmington, Florence, or Charleston. Must be 21 to buy. Will not ship unless you arrange all the details and i just have to drop it off. 

It has a list of things to go with it.
--picatinny rail on the top AND on the bottom. for lights, lasers, sights, anything.
--low profile laser with adjustable windage and elevation.
--red dot doctor sight on top with same type of adjustments.
--cover for the doc sight
--Allen wrench for moving sights around and what have you.
--10 round magazine
--thread protector for the threaded barrel
--Custom kydex grip panels

It has a few modifications done to it.
--sling shot mod, makes it easy to release the bolt when reloading.
--magazine safety removed, makes it so you can still fire a round when the mag is removed( incase you only want to load one round, you don't need the mag.)
--red added to safety to make it easier to see
--Custom grip panels, black on black just look great!

It is a very strong, thick-walled cartridge which when loaded is approximately the same OAL as a standard .45ACP round. Due to the larger caliber, the cartridge operates at relatively low pressure and has a long reloading life.

The concept was to create a practical 50 caliber pistol without unnecessary bulk and weight but with the benefits of increased knockdown power while still being completely controllable during rapid fire. The 50GI was intended primarily as a self-defense round but is still very versatile and can be loaded to higher or lower levels if desired. 

The attributes of the listing say 50 Action Express, but this is the 50 GI, it is a totally different cartridge, see pictures below.  

50 GI with a 300 Grain JHP at 950 fps has more knockdown power than a 44 Magnum 240 gr JHP going 1350 fps.  

Taylor Knockdown ratings:
50 GI 300 Grain JHP @950 fps = 20.36
44 Mag 240 Grain JHP @1350 fps = 19.86

The wood has some dings in it, but they're minor and could be cleaned up if someone was so inclined. I didn't want to alter this rifle in any way, so I haven't tried.

These were made in the 50's and 60's by Egypt using machines that originally made the Swedish AG-42, which is similar in action but a different caliber.
These rifles were some of the first direct impingement battle rifles. Only 70,000 or so were ever made, and of that only a couple thousand were imported into the US. They have an adjustable gas system, excellent muzzle break, and are fed by 10 round detachable box magazines.

Bore and crown are in good shape, the bore is PRISTINE and it shoots straight as an arrow. Took it out recently and put about 60 rounds of Yugo FMJ through it and it ran flawlessly.
Have a couple boxes of ammo still on clips to go with it.

Any other questions, just ask."

This pistol is in beautiful shape and functions perfectly. The fellow I got it from said it had been in his Aunt's house since she purchased it new in box and was probably never fired. He fired 3 magazines through it with no issues. After I got it I took it to the range and fired another 3 magazines with no issues. So, less than 50 rounds down the pipe.

This pistol was manufactured in 1924. As was common with many of these pistols, the nickel plating was not factory original, nor were the white grips it came with. I still have the original white Franzite grips, but replaced them with a new set of laser etched checkered walnut grips based on the original COLT pony style that look great. I have the original box as well. I am guessing the nickle plating is better than 95% -- only noticeable loss is on the side of the magazine itself, with two pinhead sized spots missing at the extractor and muzzle crown which are easily overlooked. No other scratches or dings of note.

Pistol is worth about 650, but I got a good deal on it and do not expect to get that much out of it in this economy. Grips cost me about 70.

Although I could really use the cash, I'd like to trade this for something else, preferably something of lesser value plus cash. I am interested in .380 ACP right now, but not terribly fond of polymer or striker fired. I prefer aluminum alloy frames or steel. I like the SIG 230/232 and Bersa Thunder. Would especially be interested in a Thunder with satin nickel frame and slide. Will consider other interesting .380 pistols, including double stacks. Would also consider a Beretta Jetfire .25 as a partial trade.  Will entertain fair and reasonable cash offers as well.

I noticed another ad posted for a nickel Colt .25 yesterday, but this is a different pistol and seller.  Will try to get pics up later tonight."

The DPMS LR-308 Semi Auto Sniper System (SASS) was born of military necessity. US Military Snipers and marksmen overseas found themselves rapidly switching from scenarios involving precision long range shooting one moment, to close, violent encounters where they were at a disadvantage due to the low ammunition capacity and slow rate of fire of their bolt action rifles. The Government sought a solution to this problem...The DPMS SASS is the answer.

With an 18” fluted bull barrel, free floating 4 rail hand-guards, and JP adjustable Trigger, it is capable of sub-MOA accuracy at long range, fulfilling its role as a precision rifle. The 19 + 1 ammunition capacity and semi auto fire control group ensure the shooter is never outgunned, and allows for faster follow up shots. The Magpul PRS stock (new for 2008, previous models feature a VLTOR modstock), Panther Flash hider, DPMS Mangonel back up iron sights, and A3 receiver, complete the package.

Look, I know my old six shooter isn't the prettiest or most rare gun on the site. It functions flawlessly and is dead accurate though. Also I'm not in that big a rush to be rid of it either. However since I had to sell off my other pistols & long guns to pay off my wifes hospital bill it's all I've got left to barter.
 All that being said, I don't expect you to offer your Colt, Kimber or whatever high dollar gun you have either. Lower end used (not used up!) 1911's like Llama are along the lines of what I expect. As long as it functions 100%"
