I'm doing this as a make offer only, so I will not state prices.


1) Glock 19. The gun is like-new in box with NO marks of any kind. Comes with all of the things you'd get as you would if you bought it new. The Glock is in perfect condition and has only had two magazines through it. The gun is a generation III Glock. This gun will come with two magazines. This gun is chambered in 9mm.

2) Glock 21. This gun has been my favorite for a while, although I've only run one magazine through it. (I have owned a couple Glock 21s in my time so this one was bought to be a safe queen.) The gun is in like-new in box condition with NO marks of any kind. This Glock will come with all of the things you would receive if you were to buy this straight from the factory yourself. The gun also has Trijicon NIGHT SIGHTS as well. The Glock 21 is a generation III. This gun is chambered in .45ACP."

I am looking for $OLD!!! OBO. No Low Balling! Make me a fair offer & I will consider it. First ""I'll take it"" followed by a PM gets this PM7. If you put I'll take it & back out for any reason, a NEGATIVE iTrader feedback will be left.

This Dan Wesson has definitely been used but not abused. It has some scratches as seen in the pictures below, it is a shooter and definitely NOT a safe queen. It also has the idiot mark that was put there from the previous owner. However, this has the ""Match"" barrel & shoots like a dream. The scratches are just cosmetic. This is one of the best PRODUCTION 1911's for the money, no MIM parts!

The bullet’s nylon coating reportedly helps reduce airborne lead, and it helps prevent the soft lead from building up in the revolver barrels. 
As every shooter knows (or should know), there are no magic bullets. Expect none of the commercially available .38 Special cartridges to provide instant incapacitation of drug-crazed dragons. The Evan Marshall statistics show that from a 2’’ barrel the standard velocity 125 grain Nyclad .38 hollowpoint has a one-shot-stop about 63% of the time. The .38 Special 158-grain roundnose has a one-shot-stop record of only around 49% when fired from a 2’’ barrel. The +P 158-grain lead semi-wadcutter hollowpoint is successful from a 2’’ barrel 67% of the time -- ---------------------------------REDACTED----------------------

This has been my daily carry gun for the past year and has served me very well. I shot my father in law's Kahr today and it just fits in my big bear paws better, so I am looking to get one of those.

Specifics:
LC9 is in very good shape for a daily carry gun. It has about 400 rounds through it and has the typical barrel wear on top of barrel from sliding against the slide. The only hick-up that it has ever had was when the firing pin broke on me last month, I sent it back to Ruger and had it back in a week with a new firing pin and 40+ rounds through it at the factory to make sure it functioned flawlessly. I have really worked with the trigger on this gun and have dry fired it quite a bit in the last year, which caused the firing pin to break. It is working flawlessly now since it came back from Ruger.

Extras:
This gun comes with a custom Harwell IWB Kydex and Leather Holster ($55 retail), a Fobus holster that works with the gun without the laser guard, and a Biancci IWB rough-out leather holster with a retention strap. The gun also comes with original box, lock, (2) 7 round mags, and soft case. It is a very nice package for CCW.

I am looking to trade for Kahr CW9 in very good condition + some cash to even out the trade.

I am willing to sell the pistol (and extras) without the Crimson Trace Laser Guard for $375

Parlor pistols and rifles (zimmerschutzen from German, ""room marksman"" or ""room shoot"") were popularized in the mid to late 19th Century, particularly in the Germanic countries, as a way to entertain guests, have family fun, and to increase one's shooting skills. Generally heavy barreled and often elaborately engraved rifles (zimmerbusche) were produced for clearly upscale clients. These generally used a Flobert (CB-Cap) cartridge chambered a few inches from the muzzle. Sometimes equally elaborate parlor pistols (zimmerpistole) were chambered for Flobert cartridges or simply used a percussion cap. In this country, a small, almost toylike parlor pistol was briefly manufactured by Remington in 1860.

I have a LNIB Mossberg 590A1 18.5"" Adjustable Stock, 3-Dot Sights, and Parkerized finish. These retail for upwards of $549.99 + tax or shipping.  I have fired 50 rounds down the pipe. Love the platform; but just can't let go of the 870. No need for two shotty's so this one's gotta go. I'm asking $480.00 for the 590a1.

You might be asking why I'm taking such a hit on a firearm that is barely used; well there is a tiny superficial scratch on the reciever (obviously doesn't effect function); so I know most of you are anal like me; so I had to decrease value accordingly due to that ding. I have a nice gunsmith at H&H put some bluing over the scratch; so it's nearly unnoticeable. If you want to see pics of the superficial scratch; I can text you a pic.

Barrel measures 19-1/2 inches.  Holds 7 rounds with one in the receiver.  Comes with one box of Remington 170 grain bullets.

Mechanically/functionally it is perfect.  However, he never kept it in a case and basically hauled it around behind the truck seat or in a trunk and it shows.  There are nicks in the grip and stock.

Not perfect by any means, but this would be a nice little carbine for this coming season, one you wouldn't have to worry too much about putting a scratch on.

I just changed the plug and did some minor maintenance. You will not find a nicer quad at this price. The plastic is in good condition with a few marks and dings but no serious cracks or anything. I will also consider trades for guns or bulk ammo in certain calibers. Cash is king. This is an automatic model. The only issue is that the electric start is broken. The pull start still works fine. It has been sitting for a month or so and was rarely used before that. It was originally purchased for my wife and it is just a little too much for her. Thanks."

One Sig GSR Revolution railed up for sale, with two 7-round magazines, X300 LED Surefire light, BladeTech paddle holster (carbon-fiber finish), and Hogue grip. This had some teething problems before break-in, but now runs perfect at ~700 round count. Very accurate to boot. Tritium night sights are good, buffer installed, and has a finger-groove insert installed under the original Sig grips. Dummy scratch is present, but other than that, I would rate it in overall excellent condition. Will not seperate, this is a package deal. Holster will not retain the pistol without the light attached. 

Trades considered include: Browning HP, Beretta 96, or Walther P99QA (1st gen. model) in .40S&W ONLY, a commander or officer sized 1911 in .45ACP, .45ACP revolver (4"" barrel), or .357 8-shot revolver. You can shoot me an offer for other pistols in those calibers, but not interested in tupperwear guns (Glocks, XD's, ect.) This will be a daily carry/shooter, so I have no need for special edition/limited models either. Just looking for a solid, plain jane piece. 

$900 or best offer for the package. Located in the south Fox Valley area, occasionally make my way up near Stevens Point. Willing to accomodate a meet halfway, or closer if convenient."

These later Remingtons are a bit more hard to find than 1917 dated examples. This particular rifle has not spent any time in Finland, as is typical for many M91's, but I've never been 100% sure on it's history. It has some Spanish Civil War features, but a few of the parts are not correct for a rifle which spent time in Spain, so I've never considered it as such. It's possible the incorrect parts were added by someone here in the States, but there's no saying for sure. The other possibility is it's from a Balkan nation (Romania, Albania, ect).

In any case it's not import marked and has a pretty nice bore on it. A bit dark, but strong lands and grooves.

I'd prefer to trade for another C&R rifle first, but I might sell it if I get a good offer.

Galil's have the highest combination of accuracy and durability of all assault rifles. Its a Caspian milled receiver marked century arms with an F stamp, if you know what that means. Basically the parts are all IMI issue mil-spec (which is now IWI), imported by century. The receivers marked century were either built by ORF or Caspian. The ORF models did not all get properly heat treated so the Caspian starting with serial number GLN (what I have) is very desirable. Furthermore there was a recall on several early models so they started marking the bottom of the new models with an ""X"" for passing condition and an ""F"" for the finest condition firearms. The F stamped lower receivers are obviously the most desirable and mine is also an ""F"" stamp. Galils like mine are almost never seen up for sale, and if you buy a cheap CAI Galil the receiver will not be properly heat treated, and the head spacing will be off at the very least. Thats why my Galil is directly comparible to a $2000+ IMI al original Galil because that's basically what it is... When Caspian made the receivers they parkerized the whole thing including the chamber... I have since polished the chamber just because thats how God and Uzial Gal (the inventor of the Galil and Uzi) intended it to be. The headspacing is correct as well as the height of the feed ramp. I have added quad rail, front grip, and polished chamber. Comes with 7 mags and possibly up to 200 rounds ammo. Shoots steel case all day. Shoals area.

Lone Wolf match grade engraved barrel that is stainless and extended a half inch, Lone Wolf match grade trigger with trigger job, Lone Wolf match grade titanium guidr rod and titanium springs, Lone Wolf firing pin, extended mag release by Glock. Thats all the internal aftermarket parts i can think of... As far as exterior performance it has a magwell, hogue grip sleeve made specifically for yhis glock, grooved slide, accessory rail, glock grip tape on trigger guard and slide. Thats all i can think of... As far as optics it has new night sites on the rear (i have the front one also if you prefer and it is included) and in the front it has a fiber optic site in florescent green glow that makes aiming this beast a breeze. As far as what allbit comes with and accessories, it comes with 3 15 round mags, a case, cleaning brush, fubos tactical holster, glock take down nice parts diagram cleaning mat, a box of law enforcement hollow points, and the front night site. As far as price, i am being way way more than fair to sell it for 800.00. The gun valued used at 475 stock and taking a little off of the parts still adds up to over 1100.00. Trade value is at 900.00. If you have a seroius cash offer i will listen, if you don't i will ignore or argue with you, whichever mood i am in. As far as convenience, i work alot but i can meet within reasonable distance, you can text or call my cell but you may get a voicemail, leave a message.

This quad is in good condition and runs very well. The tires are in good condition. Starts up and runs great. Also has a tow bar for pulling. This atv is rarely used so it needs to find another home. Attached is a stock photo. If you would like actual photos of the atv, please contact me and I will send them via email. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I am asking $1500 or best offer. I just changed the plug and did some minor maintenance. You will not find a nicer quad at this price. The plastic is in good condition with a few marks and dings but no serious cracks or anything. I will also consider trades for guns or bulk ammo in certain calibers. Cash is king. This is an automatic model. The only issue is that the electric start is broken. The pull start still works fine. It has been sitting for a month or so and was rarely used before that. It was originally purchased for my wife and it is just a little too much for her. Thanks.

I started out in the 400 dollar range,as this is what the few I'd seen had been selling for.My wife is enamored with a friend's  Ruger Charger that she can hold like a rifle , can pick up much easier and hit what she is aiming at with a laser(lol).Therefore,if I can get enough to get her the Charger,that will be good for anyone interested in this gun.

No box or papers. Full disclosure would include the fact that there is some very slight pitting (needle tip size) where the old Hogue grips rode, and when I say slight, I mean you have to look for the marks, thus the lower price.

I am the second owner of this pistol and have put 300 rounds through it. I have no idea how many the original owner put through it. It locks up good, and will shoot as fast as you can pull the trigger.

Finish is stainless redone with a  satin type polish like on some S&W's. It is much easier to maintain than the bead blast type finish. 

White outline rear sight, partridge front blade. Wearing a set of Pachamyr Presentation grips (smaller k-frame type)

Brownell's trigger kit is installed in the pistol, along with an extra length firing pin. The original hammer spring, rebound spring, and firing pin are included with pistol. Will also include a couple steel full moon clips and some RIMZ poly ones. It can be fired without moon clips, but extractor star will not push cases out.

The pistol is pretty accurate and has a nice trigger pull (about 3 pounds single, and 8 pounds double action, it has no problems lighting off CCI primers.

Price is $600 cash, face to face in Windsor, Fort Collins, Loveland. I will need to see a valid Colorado Driver's License or CCW card to complete sale. Sold as is.

If you would like to shoot the pistol before buying it, you can do so at the Front Range Gun Club in Loveland as a guest of mine for like $13 + cost of ammo, providing you can pass a background check.

It's a stainless steel finish with soft rubber Rossi grips, much like the Pachmyr set I put on my other revolver.  It's 2"" barrel makes it a great pistol for concealed carry, and the added weight of the stainless steel frame will definately help you with those heavy 357 Magnum rounds, or 38 Special +P.   I am the second person to own this gun, and I haven't shot it.  The lady I got it from says she fired 200-300 rounds out of it over the period of a few years. It has a few light handling marks.  It does not come with the original box, or owners manual.  There is a cheap little holster with it as well.

 For those of you that are unfamiliar with Rossi handguns, they're made in Brazil by Taurus.  I've included some info below off the Rossi website.

MODEL R46202FC .357 MAGNUM 2"" BARREL IN STAINLESS STEEL
These handguns are built to the same quality and reliability standards that have been part of the Rossi name for over 100 years.  Rossi offers medium and small frame revolvers in various barrel lengths-all feature deep, contoured finger grooves in the grip for a solid grasp and maximum shooting comfort.  Rossi revolvers are machined from forged steel and will routinely fire powerful .38 Special +P rounds for the lifetime of your revolver.

According to Rossi, MSRP on a new one is $461. 

Going rate on gunbroker.com is $350-365 for new.  I'm asking $300 cash OBO.  No trades will be entertained.

Please have NC CCP or pistol purchase permit in hand.  No exceptions will be made.  Buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale, which you will be provided a copy of at the sale.  I will not travel, I will not ship.  This is a face to face transaction.

Would prefer a rifle with a magazine rather than single shot but I would not pass up a good deal on a single shot.

- Original CZ case & box, cleaning kit, cable lock, manual, factory target & original plastic grips

I purchased this new a couple months ago. It has only seen limited range use, and it has been thoroughly cleaned each time. It’s accurate and functions perfectly, but it is a bit disappointing to shoot side by side with my Hi Power and 1911 (i.e. trigger). It needs a good home and an owner who will use it more.

Face to face in Fort Collins ONLY

Price is firm. I have about $300 worth of goodies included, and I do not need to sell.

Buyer must sign bill of sale and present valid CO driver’s license. Must be 21. CHP preferred.

Cash only
