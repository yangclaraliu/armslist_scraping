Stripped Glock 23C & 26 Slide and Barrel 

These Glocks where retrieved from a safe that was in the high park fire 
I was going to rebuild them but need money to rebuild a H&K P7M8 9mm and the parts for that gun are not cheap 

The slides and barrels have been bead blasted and cleaned 

The Glock 23C has quite a bit of heat pitting on it but nothing a coat of Dura Coat would not take care of. The fire did not get hot enough to un-temper the steel. the Glock 26 has very little pitting at all 

the slides and barrels will also come with the Extractor, Firing Pin, Firing Pin Safety and Extractor Depressor Plunger (No Springs or Slide Cover Plates)

I was going to buy all the parts i need to make them complete gun from http://glockstore.com

87,http://www.armslist.com/posts/538087,Want To Buy:  Looking for restoration of my shotgun (I am willing to ship),"Westchester NY Area, New York, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Wednesday, August 29, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a Belgian made ""Manhattan interchangeable"" double barrel hammer shotgun. I know (err I am pretty sure) its not worth much and likely never will be (but please do correct me if I am wrong) so I would like to hire some one to restore it into working condition so I can enjoy it a few times year. Additionally I would like for some one to point out the appropriate type of ammunition to use it with it and where I can procure some. I know the barrels are Damascus barrels and I am sure that since it is a hammer gun that the original loads for it must have been black powder as this is what they were shooting back then. I believe the gun  dates from 1905 + or - 10 years but more likely leaning towards the +. It is a ""Manhattan arms"" shotgun. 

The bore is in pretty decent shape and the trigger mechanisms work quite well. The springs are still quite heavy and I imagine that this gun was not used very often. Frankly I impressed with the quality since it must be over 100 years old. 

I would get a real kick out of (no pun intended) bringing it along with me on one or two shoots a year and shooting some skeet or trap with it. 

I would be interested in a full restoration including Re-bluing, polishing of the receiver (it has a very ornate and wonderful pattern), possible finish work to the stock if you think it needs it (but most likely not). And any functional repairs or maintenance required. 

I have all the parts for the gun, and I will include as many pictures as I can. However if you are interested in doing this work please email me and I can send more detailed photos. 

Please email me an idea on price after you have looked at all the pics and keep in mind that when you get the gun from me the barrel will down to bare metal, the bore will be honed / polished and the bump at the end of the barrel will be fixed.

French MAS-36 is a short, carbine-style rifle with a two-piece stock and slab-sided receiver. It is chambered for the modern, rimless 7.5x54 French cartridge
The MAS-36 bolt handle was bent forward in an ""awkward fashion"" to bring it into a convenient position for the soldier's hand.[2] The MAS-36 had a relatively short barrel and was fitted with large aperture (rear) and post (front) sights designed for typical combat ranges. Typical for French rifles of the period, the MAS-36 had no manual safety.[3] It was normally carried with a loaded magazine and empty chamber until the soldier was engaged in combat, though the rifle's firing mechanism could be blocked by raising the bolt handle. The MAS-36 carried a 17-inch spike bayonet, reversed in a tube below the barrel. To use the bayonet, a spring plunger was pressed to release the bayonet. It was then free to be pulled out, turned around, and fitted back into its receptacle."

Has the bayonet lug which will fit a standard m-9 bayonet. The gun is in good shape with low round count (around 20). Has a little wear on the magazine tube from the pump from cycling the action, still looks awesome, it just happens on pumps!!

The firearm functions very well and is comfortable to shoot or carry.

The Ultra RCP is Kimber's ultimate concealed carry pistol. This is the older version with black grips and external extractor. This pistol has no traditional sights but rather a trench the user aims through. You can be surprisingly accurate with this little pistol despite its lack of traditional sights.

There is a small blemish on the frame visible in one of the pictures I posted above the trigger on right side of gun. Other than that only slight holster wear and faint scratching from being used as a carry. This is the only damage or blemish on this pistol and does not impair its function.

Been kept clean and only left the safe a few times. Uses AR15 magazines, mag release, triggers, hammers, dis-connector, and selector. So, it can be customized with those compatible parts if you wish. 

Upper receiver has an 18"" 1:9 twist barrel, and a 5.56 chamber. I fired a couple hundred rounds of 62grn green tips in one range session with no problems, but ive mostly shot 55grn .223 through it, and its accurate with both types of ammo. It features a reliable but uniquely light piston operating system. Rifle barely weighs 6 pounds! Compare that to other piston alternatives to the AR15. It's easy to break down and clean.

The stock is removable and can be replaced with an ACE folding stock, among others. I was going to do that myself, but finances prevented it. I bought this in order to have a second rifle that would work with my existing AR15 rig. Now I kinda need the cash more than a backup rifle. I might consider a trade down toward an inexpensive but reliable handgun, an ar15 lower, or a kel tec sub2000 w/glock mags, and at least some cash on your end. If your cash-only offer is too low, I will not get pissed but I will say ""no."" I don't need to sell to pay bills, I need to sell to put money into other fun stuff.

Only modifications are a luminescent paint bead on front sight (removable), rail for vert grip under handguard (removable) and single point sling attachment (removable). Im including the front sling swivel for 2-point sling use, one pmag, and one GI mag with magpul spring/follower/ranger floorplate. BTW, this rifle fit and fed aluminum and steel mags, as well as new and old pmags, master molder mag, and 60 round surefire mag.

$700 OBO. Must be able to legally own and have TN ID. If you have a carry permit, that's all the better. Thanks and God Bless."

The AK-47 type Compensator for 7.62x39 caliber rifles carries the Arsenal Inc logo and the “US” marking as a testament to its uncompromising quality. The new compensator combines a slick design with detailed attention to perfect functionality and workmanship. This compensator is made in one piece and incorporates the ever popular cresset design. The one-piece design creates a perfectly symmetric compensator, resulting in an equal amount of excess gas escape and uniform recoil reduction with no negative effect on accuracy. Utilizing precision cutting machines, Arsenal Inc. ensured that the unit is coaxial, with the threads and the two concentric circular openings being centered and perpendicular to the cylindrical body of the compensator. The combination of high grade tool steel and sophisticated heat treating process in vacuum furnaces result in a compensator that maintains its perfectly cylindrical shape, free of any warping, deformation, collapse, or surface contaminants. The consistent and precision cut 24x1.5mm right-hand threads eliminate the wobbly effect common with other units. The compensator remains rock solid even if the incorrectly cut threads on your front sight block do not allow it to screw on flush with the wall of the block. Summary: Compensator, US made for AK-47 (7.62x39 caliber) in AK-74 style. Fits directly to front sight block 24x1.5mm right-hand threads (DOES NOT FIT DIRECTLY ONTO BARREL). One piece “half moon” design."

It is chambered for the modern, rimless 7.5x54 French cartridge
The MAS-36 bolt handle was bent forward in an ""awkward fashion"" to bring it into a convenient position for the soldier's hand.[2] The MAS-36 had a relatively short barrel and was fitted with large aperture (rear) and post (front) sights designed for typical combat ranges. Typical for French rifles of the period, the MAS-36 had no manual safety.[3] It was normally carried with a loaded magazine and empty chamber until the soldier was engaged in combat, though the rifle's firing mechanism could be blocked by raising the bolt handle. 
The MAS-36 carried a 17-inch spike bayonet, reversed in a tube below the barrel. To use the bayonet, a spring plunger was pressed to release the bayonet. It was then free to be pulled out, turned around, and fitted back into its receptacle.

*Has clearly been taken care of (2 owners)
*Nice, clean trigger pull 
*No rust anywhere
*Barrel looks good
*Very accurate (easily zeroed in at 100 yards)

The Not-So-Good
*Stock has a few scratches
*Barrel, receiver, and trigger guard are flaking (see pics)
*Doesn't really like lower velocity rounds (Bolt has a little bit of a catch when returning to battery, significant enough that lower velocity rounds will not always completely cycle. Could likely be addressed by someone with some light sanding, but it's really not necessary, as the gun works just fine with CCI's, etc.)


I paid $125 for it a few months back, and have shot it twice since then.  Selling because I prefer bolt action for this application.  This is a really neat gun in good working order, great for a novice shooter who wants a dependable, entry-level 22 at a great price."
