Pendersoli Model 1874 Sporting Extra Deluxe

Hello, I bought the gun below about ten years ago with the thought that I would be using it for long range cowboy action shooting.  Well, ten years later it never happened.  I have shot several hundred rounds thru this gun over the years and actually taken it to Montana buffalo hunting.  Yep, I got one.  I am unsure how to grade a gun and this one is in great shape but not perfect so I will be happy to send pics to anyone who may be interested.  I am the original owner of this gun and have decided to sell.  Since I am not sure how to grade this gun I hope potential buyers would be able to come check it out for yourselves.  These are quite pricey now but I got a great deal when I bought it and it is priced to sell so I will part with this for $1500 which is less than half of what you would pay for a new one.  
My name is Dean Akey and you can reach me at REDACTED.  I live in Elburn IL.  Thank you and please let me know if you have any questions.  I do travel for work frequently so the best way to ask questions is via e mail.  You can e mail me at REDACTED.

The laptop I'm actually posting this from is the T42.  It's in really good shape, running Windows XP Professional, and it has Office and stuff on it.  If you are just gonna browse the web, it'd do pretty well - if you want to get any more intensive it may need another stick of RAM.

The T43s (there are two of them) are a little bit ill.  One of them has a broken hinge and was included for parts I guess.  The other one only turns on for a second and turns right back off.  I don't know if the battery is bad or what since it just won't come up.

Thought I would give this a try and save $100 bucks.  Anything higher and I will just pickup a new one this weekend and be happy.  If you have a Gen 3 Glock 17 or 22 sitting around... Just think, You have had it in your sock drawer for 6 months.. $400 cash looks a lot better collecting dust in your drawer than something you might shoot once a year... lol   Let me know what you have!

To help you along in your cost assessment; below is rough estimate of current value of the rifle and accessories:
rifle w/ clone reciever all other parts original HK with original black furniture and wide forearm - ~$700 - 800
HK steel bipod - ~$60 -75
magpul prs buttstock (w/ heavy buffer spring) - ~$200 - 250
Leapers forearm w/ modern railing - ~$70-75
B square claw scope mount - ~$50
10 HK steel and aluminum mags - ~$3-7 each
set of green HK furniture with the jungle slim forearm and buttstock with buffer spring - ~$20
HK battle sling - $30

There are some normal wear on the finish hardly noticable.  There is a more noticable scratch on the top of the receiver where the claw mount attaches that when the mount is on, you cannot see it."

So the glock currently is all factory but will also come with extended mag release and slide stop lever and extended take down lever. The glock has adjustable rear sights and comes with tool.

Looking for possible trades for this excellent shotgun. I traded for it on a whim and unless I want to punish myself with slugs at the range, I have nowhere to shoot it except twice a year at my friends property in MI. It is incredibly accurate with Federal Truball slugs, thats all I have had a chance to fire out of it. Its clean, 99% condition and has been treated with froglube.

I'm not too keen on giving it up but I'm putting it out there for the right trade. Ya just never know.

I would like to complete my basic handgun collection so I am listening to trades for the following.

Glock 17 Gen3 with all factory stuff
Beretta 92FS, M9
1911 style in 9mm
GSG 1911 .22
Other 9mm??

DAVIDSON'S AND TAURUS - 2 LIFETIME TRANSFERABLE WARRANTIES!
Brand new, sealed, still has the manufacturer's grease on it, the Taurus PT 99 AF has an adjustable sight
and is the MOST TESTED and widely used double action auto-loader design in history.

Refined and enhanced by Taurus to be better than the originals. The action on this gun is silky SMOOOOOTH. Bought 1 for myself, too.

Most notable is the Taurus innovation of a three position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety which allows these guns to be carried in classic DA cocked and locked mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. I'm a female leftie - the ambidextrous control is exactly where it needs to be to make it easy for me to use.

Other features include accessory rail, three dot micrometer adjustable low profile sights, and the Taurus Security System.

**TWO Lifetime TRANSFERABLE Warranties, New In Box, Cleaning Brush, two lock keys (locks directly on body of gun), small screwdriver, and two 17 rd magazines.**

Kahr CW9.  500 rounds fired so it is just broken in for you.  :)

I've never had a failure with it, not even during the recommended 200 round break in period.  Long, smooth trigger pull feels like a really nice revolver trigger job.  The sights are actually pretty nice for a gun this small and it is very comfortable to shoot in my opinion.

Completely internal! Keep your current holster for your GLOCK, keep your tactical lights, keep your favorite grips. Extremely rugged. The LaserMax Guide Rod Laser for GLOCK meets or exceeds both Mil-Spec and Homeland Security durability test standards (drop tests, blowing sand, temperature and humidity extremes, salt water fog, deep water immersion, 20,000+ rounds live fire). Installation takes minutes. If you can field-strip your GLOCK, you can install your LaserMax Guide Rod Laser sight—No gunsmithing to your GLOCK required. Hi-Visibility Pulsating Beam. A pulsating laser beam gives effortless awareness of muzzle direction, and it transcends language barriers. It can be used outdoors from dusk till dawn, or indoors round-the-clock. Infra-Red versions are optimized for NVG characteristics. Alignment. The Internal Guide Rod lasers for GLOCK come permanently aligned from the factory* for center-of-mass accuracy at 20 yards. It will never drift out of alignment. There is no need to re-zero after changing batteries. Accuracy. As close to the bore of the GLOCK as possible, positioning allows for the closest and most consistent relationship between your point of aim and point of impact (POA/POI) over all shooting distances. Especially useful for moving targets. Turn it on! Ambidextrous switch in custom take-down lever that very closely resembles the factory GLOCK take down lever. Deliberate on/off activation which is highly desirable in a tactical or personal defense situation!
