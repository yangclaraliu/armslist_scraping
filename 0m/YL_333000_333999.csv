It's the only thing wrong with it, and I've only flipped it open.... it hasn't even cut anything.

I have a solid gold 24kt Canadian Maple leaf Coin, circa 1988. Its half ounce in weight. Ii is in mint condition. At todays gold prices it has a value of a $1000 (monex.com) or to as high as $1400 (ebay.com).

The price of gold is steadily moving up, and is predicted to go as high as $2000 an ounce or more!! So this coin is going to be worth a lot more in the future.
I am interested in trading for a Sig 551 or Sig 556 rifle (223 cal). Looking to do a straight trade

Will also consider trading against a full size Kimber 1911 (45 acp) not interested in compacts. I will also consider a muti gun trade, Glocks, Beretta, Springfield 1911, quality stripped AR lower (no plum crazy!), maybe AR upper, depending on what you got (I can buy NEW DSA AR Uppers for $395 complete).

I will consider all trades as long as they are not junk!! I am familar with the value of gold and guns so lowballers and scammers need not reply. If you are fair with me I will be fair with you. If you hold onto this coin more than likely it will increase in value!!

It is the model 715 in stainless steel.  It has a 3"" fixed barrel and an incredibly smooth action.  It is a very accurate revolver and has an adjustable rear sight for windage and elevation.  If you shoot .38 special it feels more like you're shooting a .22!  Even with .357 the recoil is very manageable.   

I'd like to get $425 for it, but I am open to trades as well.

I am an FFL dealer, but as this is part of my private collection no background check or form 4473 is required.  

Thanks for looking!

 I take personal defense seriously and wanted to make sure the gun was completely dependable and that extra parts were available immediately should they become lost or broken. I do this with every firearm I own. When SHTF, where are you going to buy extra parts should the need arise? 
 It's accurate and the recoil is mild. Especially with the extra power Wolff springs. Looking for a trade value of $635(15% off retail) or $595.00(20% off retail) cash.  I can add 800 rounds of XTP hollow point ammo depending on price difference. 

We're good on handguns so looking for long gun trades. Here is what we're interested in and in order of interest:

5.7x28mm(AR57 platform, complete or upper only)
22 LR(10/22, Marlin 60, possibly others mag/tube semi/bolt)
22 magnum(mag/tube semi/bolt prefer Savage, Marlin)
22-250 Savage with Accutrigger
204 Savage with Accutrigger
357 magnum(lever action only)
45-70(lever action only)
12 ga pump ro semi(maverick 88/Mossberg 500/Rem 870/Saiga)
12 ga SxS
410 Saiga


The addition of cash/ammo by either party will be determined by real world value. A new LCP with Crimson Trace runs $500+- without all the extras. My prices are fair and(in my opinion) how a used firearm should be priced. You must be willing to price your used firearm realistically(i.e. value it less than full retail as I have mine) to do business with me. Too many ruger 10/22 ""sellers"" wanting to trade even."

This is a great combination scope for small game and target because at 1.5 magnification it is very easy to “find” your target in the field of view. I set this up to use rabbit hunting and it’s very well suited for that. This rifle is in very good condition, the scratches that show up in the pictures surprised me because it doesn’t look that bad in person, these pictures represent the “worst” spots. The bluing is in great condition, and it fires flawlessly. I bought this gun in the early ‘80s. The new guns don’t have the nice graining in the wood like this."

The hydrographic process can be used on metal, plastic, glass, hard woods, and various other materials. In the process, the substrate piece to be printed is pre-treated and a base coat material is applied. A polyvinyl alcohol film is gravure-printed with the graphic image to be transferred, and is then floated on the surface of a vat of water. An activator chemical is sprayed on the film to dissolve it into a liquid and activate a bonding agent. The piece is then lowered into the vat, through the floating ink layer, which wraps around and adheres to it. After removing the piece from the water, a top coat is applied to protect the design. With multiple dippings, hydrographics printing can achieve full 360° coverage of the part surface, including small crevices[img]www.hlhydrographics.com[/img] Call me or Text for info on decorating your piece REDACTED website is www.hlhydrographics.com

It is marked as manufactured in 1942, and while I have no records of its service, it looks to me like it's been put to good use!

The weapon is approximately 44½"" overall and weighs just a little over 10 pounds as shown – with sling, scope and an empty 10-round magazine. I personally have never fired this weapon, but it appears to be in excellent functional condition. As I said, it clearly has not spent the last 70 years in a rack, but the action is clean and slick, and the bore is clean and shiny with strong rifling. It's still ready to go!

Included in the sale is the military-style (I believe, original-style) web sling; a knife bayonet with scabbard; a spike bayonet with scabbard; the Simmons 3-9x40 Wideview scope and mount shown on the weapon; and the one 10-round magazine shown. Also included are 219 rounds of loaded ammo, some commercial and some military; 122 reloadable .303 Brit brass shell casings, mostly new; and a set of RCBS reloading dies for this caliber. It's a complete package to enjoy this gun for a long time to come!

If desired, I would sell the weapon without the scope, and I could also sell the ammunition and components separately, though I will not do so until the weapon is sold.

All in all, The rifle, scope, other accessories, ammo, and reloading stuff is worth $550.  Please be prepared with cash in hand, proof of Texas residence, and be willing to sign a bill of sale. I would prefer to deal face-to-face anywhere in the San Antonio area, but I try to be accommodating.

If you're interested in trading, the only things I'm specifically looking for are a GI-issue M-1 Carbine, a Springfield M1A NM, and a Saiga-12, but let me know what you have to trade and we'll see if we can work out something. I'll have several others to list in the next few days.

The 9mm has been fired and has the upgraded bolt assembly. The 45acp is brand new, never fired. I ordered a threaded barrel for the 45acp.

The JRC is an ambidextrous design allowing for either right or left handed shooters. Changing from right to left hand takes just a minute or so.

Changing calibers on the JRC is simple as well and only takes a few minutes. All tools needed for the caliber change are included in the kit.

The JRC is an AR type weapon. It uses standard AR trigger groups, safety's, buttstocks and pistol grips. Any upgraded parts that would fit on your AR will fit on the JRC. The JRC also has a floating quad fore end allowing you to use any picatinny mounted accessory.

I only have the 9mm and the 45acp kit. JRC also offers a 40 cal kit as well. They are also working on a 22lr kit as well as a 22mag kit.

The barrel length is 16.25"". Its a flat top design.

In addition to the jrc and kits, I also have a bunch of replacement parts that come with the gun as well. These include a new firing pin and spring, 2 new buffer springs, a nylon disc.rubber buffer set, 2 new feed ramps for the magwells, threaded barrel cap, a new 9mm extractor as well as a new 45acp extractor. Plenty of parts to keep the JRC in great working order.

Both the 9mm and the 45acp use standard Glock magazines. 1-10rd 9mm and 1-10rd 45acp are included.

I've taken them out a few times, but I've never really been satisfied with their reliability--they're accurate, but the semi-auto jams too much, and the follower in the magazine in the bolt actions hangs up from time to time.  These rifles are otherwise indistinguishable from new guns, I just don't feel like spending any more time trying to figure these two out--maybe you're better with this kind of stuff than I am.  Here's what I have--you can have them both for $100, or either one for $50:
