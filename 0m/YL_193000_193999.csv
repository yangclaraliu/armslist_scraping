These were sold back in the 50's by Sears and were put together by High Standard. They are put together of the highest quality. (They dont make them like this anymore!) The action is a HVA small ring mauser (one of the best ever made.) The barrel is a chrome lined 22"" High Standard barrel. The stock is in excellent shape with no cracks and just a couple light pressure indentions. It is a very light weight Feijen with checkering. Hinged floorplate. Leupold bases and rings. 

Scope NOT included. 

There are quite of few of the model 50's (FN actions) out there but you will look a long time to find the 51L in this condition. I also have a re-production owners manual. This is basically a ""mountain"" rifle. I bet it does not weigh 6lbs without the scope. 

This one has some light blue wear at the muzzle end and a couple light scratches on the floor plate. A little bluing loss on the trigger guard. Bore is in excellent condition. No rust or pitting just some minor bluing loss in a couple small areas. 

These are SUPER accurate with butter smooth actions. The general consensus is if you can find one ""buy it.""

This is a great platform to start from for a defensive/combat style shotgun. Cut down the barrel to 18-20 inches, add a mag extension (will accept them with no modding needed because its so old) add a side saddle & new stock & forearm and you got a real nice shotgun.

These sell for at least 800, and that is with the stock (moderately crappy) mount, not the one on this model.  It is used, and has minor cosmetic scuffs (see pics), but the glass is absolutely fine so if it is not going to be used on a safe queen it is more than good to go.  1.5 magnification, just enough to bring distant targets noticeably closer, while not sacrificing speed when used on close targets.  

This particular model has a TON of eye relief, I actually had it mounted to my *quad-rail*, and had no eye-relief issues.  It puts the eye relief of other ACOG's to shame, and has the most of the entire line of ACOG's that I am aware of.  Also I was a bit hesitant to use the amber reticle (I had always used red) but I was very pleased with it, and would not hesitate to buy more amber models in the future having used this one.

It is mounted in an American Defense quick release mount, which installs via a throw lever, and will return to zero after re-installed.  Pretty neat, and worth it, especially if you use other optics or practice with your irons.  

General information on the Trijicon ACOG:  If you've read this far, you probably know at least something about these.  They are illuminated via a fiber optic, which automatically adjusts to the ambient brightness (never too bright or dim for your environment), and are also illuminated via radioactive tritium which illuminates it in total darkness (the tritium has a half-life of around a decade, Trijicon offers replacement services).  They are commonly used by servicemembers for their ease of use, and extremely durable construction.  I have absolutely nothing against this optic, it has been exceptional in every way, I just personally prefer my aimpoint."

was believed that there was little demand for the .25 model and few were made.. H&R also produced a .32 model which, while based on webley practice, was not a counterpart of any webley and scott model. it was 'hammerless' ( i.e internal hammer)model with open topped slide and extended barrel, and a short grip safety at the rear of the butt. it also used a coil spring recoil spring above the bolt, instead of the webley v-spring system. this model appeared shortly before the first world war, and continued to me made into the early 1920's. this one is clean as a whistle with original holster minor wear , no rust, no pitting. shine in bore strong rifleing. perfect grips 8+1 capacity.

Less than 100 rounds down the barrel. It is a great gun and great for concealed carry with quite a punch. I have loved this gun but I don't need a subcompact anymore and would prefer another full size pistol. The gap cartridge is newer yes, but many police departments are adopting it. It has the same ballistics as a 45acp but slightly smaller to make a subcompact 45. For a subcompact, its recoil is rather small for a 45. It has the same dimensions as the glock 26. I have 190 rounds of lawman ammo, 31 rounds of federal and 83 rounds of remington that I will include as well as 2 six round, 2 8 round and 1 10 round magazine. This is quite a discounted package. The ammo is worth over 150 dollars and the extra mags are worth 75 dollars, without shipping/tax.  I will have pictures up once I fix my camera.

Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use."

One of them is a S&W Model 586-1 with a 6"" barrel in a blue steeled finish.  It holds six (6) .357 magnum or .38 special rounds.  It features adjustable sights, though I've never had to adjust them.  It fires single action and double action, with a very smooth trigger pull in double action and a very short crisp trigger pull in single action.

I've fired this weapon only a handful of times, and have cleaned it after every firing and monthly inspections.  It has had a box of .357 magnum rounds and .38 special rounds shot through it, and has little to no wear.  This weapon has been babied, with no rough handling and has primarily sat next to my bedside in a protective case.

This weapon is versatile and can suit a number of functions.  The interchangeability between calibers allows for cheaper .38 special rounds for target shooting.  The smooth and crisp trigger pulls helps bring extreme accuracy, with adjustable sights to fine tune.  The ability to chamber heavier magnum loads allows for heavy hitting home defense as well as handgun hunting.

I have a local FFL that we can handle this transaction through at Duke's Sport Shop in New Castle, PA.  If you are requesting shipping, then email me and we'll work things out.  Payment must be in the form of money order or check."

I also loaded some with between 6.3-7.3 grains of Bullseye using 200gr handcast lead flat nose bullets and found them quite accurate at between 1.5""-2.75"" center to center at 25yds, the most accurate being the 6.3 grn load.

The Cobra Tactical delivers reliability and firepower with a 5 + 1 capacity magazine. This easy to maneuver, short barrel pump shotgun comes with a standard molded stock. The Cobra Tactical has one feature that truly separates it from the competition (aside from its incredibly low price); it comes with a return spring in the forearm. This allows the user to pull back on the forearm to eject the shell and then simply release. The spring returns the forearm back to position and shucks another shell into the chamber in one extremely fast motion, allowing for a quicker reload."

This part gives the cosmetic appearance of a factory HK select fire rifle while retaining semi-auto legality. Under federal law it is 100% legal to possess and install this part. It will NOT change the function of the firearm to full auto. Both the full and semi auto positions will produce semi auto only fire when used with a semi auto trigger pack. An unmodified full auto trigger pack CANNOT be mounted on an unmodified semi auto receiver by the use of this part. That said you can use this part with a LEGAL, REGISTERED and properly modified NFA Trigger pack, auto sear etc for a legal select fire conversion. 

I have several available. Short and long tang. Long tang is pictured. Long tang fits HK-91 only, short tang fits 91, 93 and 94. Specify which you want. Same price either way.

The rifle has a Bell & Carlson Medalist stock with the sniper hook, clearance from midway at $225. Truly free floating, as the original Hogue overmold would touch when using bags or a bipod. Some reviews have deemed this the most accurate out of the box rifle tested. Shooting American Eagle 55gr FMJ at 100 yards at I had 5 shot groups all holes touching. Scope is just a Tasco Varmint, 6-24 powered but it does the job. Mil Dot reticle. I have about $1050 in the build, and will take $750 cash or would need $850 trade.

This was Leupold's answer to the most expensive European scopes that was introduced in 2007. It was the best they ever made but didn't sell in high enough volume to stay in production. Compare this to a Schmidt & Bender to see this scope sits lower on your rifle, has as good of low-light performance, is lighter, has better turrets & covers, comes with the Alumina flip-back lens covers and rings, and has a lifetime warranty (instead of a 2-year warranty) at about half the price of a comparable Schmidt & Bender!

This is new and in the original box. Shrink-wrap was removed but the scope has never been mounted on a rifle. It is flawless. 
Scope comes with Leupold 34 mm PRW rings and Leupold Alumina flip-back lens covers in the box as a factory set. 
Xtended Twilight Lens System
DiamondCoat 2 Lens Protection
This scope has the ""pop-up"" turret covers that are captive so caps never get lost & it has side-mounted parallax adjustment.

We took the mystique and power of the last best places on earth and distilled them with crystal clarity into the single best series of hunting riflescopes on earth. The Leupold Golden Ring VX-7. A full century in the making, it was worth the wait, because the VX-7 incorporates everything we know about optical excellence. About ruggedness. Waterproofing. And the hunting spirit. The Leupold Golden Ring VX-7: built to fuel your passion, not your ego.

Product Features:
The Light Optimization Profile delivers the light transmission and light throughput benefits of a large objective, yet mounts like a riflescope with a much smaller objective lens for a better cheekweld and more comfortable shooting.
The Xtended Twilight Lens System optimizes the transmission of low-light wavelengths, so you see the details of low-light scenes in greater, brighter detail than with any other riflescope available.
Low-profile SpeeDial adjustments smoothly slide up and open for adjustment.
The finger-adjustable 1/4-MOA click adjustments are easy to zero.
A more generous eyebox than you'll find even in premium European optics.
Blackened lens edges reduce light diffusion, so more usable light reaches the shooter's eye, for a brighter image with higher resolution.
The XT Duplex reticle is a VX-7 exclusive, with unobstructed aiming at small targets at long distance, and fast, accurate target acquisition of large game at close range.
Available with the Leupold Ballistics Aiming System for more accurate long-range shooting, including the Boone and Crockett Big Game and Varmint Hunter's reticles.
Lead-free glass lenses offer the excellent optical properties such a precision instrument deserves, with greatly reduced weight. They are produced without the hazardous environmental byproducts common to standard glass production.
DiamondCoat 2 lens coatings on exterior lens surfaces provide the highest level of scratch resistance Leupold has ever offered.
Dual Spring, 4x erector system is designed to withstand the most devastating recoil. It virtually eliminates erector system backlash and stress on the internal workings of the system, for longer life.
Includes Alumina flip-back lens covers.
Internally threaded, extreme fast-focus eyepiece with Alumina rubber eyepiece guard.
Tactile power indicator identifies your magnification level with a touch.
34mm maintube crafted from 6061-T6 aircraft quality aluminum alloy increases the body strength, and allows for the necessary windage and elevation adjustment travel.
Satin black 34mm PRW rings are included with each VX-7L.
Available in our exclusive satin black finish.
Incredibly rugged, with absolute waterproof integrity.
Covered by the Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee and the VX-7 Custom Care Package.

I'd like to sell this flatbed.  I originally took it off a 79 f250 then put it on a 89 f150.  I traded in the 89 so here it is.  It looks good and is well made and in good shape.  It will likely wear out a couple more trucks. 

Yes it has a hidden hitch in the center as well as the reciever type one on the back.  It has the nice tailights installed also.  If you are setting up a hunting or work truck this is the perfect addition to it! Bow season is about to open, gun season will follow soon. 

I'd trade it for a good rifle, or 1911 45acp or maybe you can trade plus some boot if your gun isn't expensive enough for this bed."

This is a great platform to start from for a defensive/combat style shotgun. Cut down the barrel to 18-20 inches, add a mag extension (will accept them with no modding needed because its so old) add a side saddle & new stock & forearm and you got a real nice shotgun. Or use it as a hunting gun, this gun does not need to be blued if not so desired!

This part gives the cosmetic appearance of a factory HK select fire rifle while retaining semi-auto legality. Under federal law it is 100% legal to possess and install this part. It will NOT change the function of the firearm to full auto. Both the full and semi auto positions will produce semi auto only fire when used with a semi auto trigger pack. An unmodified full auto trigger pack CANNOT be mounted on an unmodified semi auto receiver by the use of this part. That said you can use this part with a LEGAL, REGISTERED and properly modified NFA Trigger pack, auto sear etc for a legal select fire conversion.

I have several available. Short and long tang. Long tang is pictured and representative sample of what they look like, they are all new. Long tang fits HK-91 only, short tang fits 91, 93 and 94. Specify which you want. Same price either way. The rifle shown in the pictures is shown for illustration purposes only and is not included in the sale. This is for the lower housing ONLY.

I built this gun for competition to compete in the United States Practical Shooting Association, Production Division. So if you were considering honing your firearm skills and shooting competitive matches this gun is already set-up and you wouldn’t need to do anything. Or if you just want a very nice Glock to shoot with at your local range this is a fun gun to shoot.  I would not recommend this gun for CCW in it’s current set-up. If you want to carry it, I recommend you replace all the aftermarket springs with Glock factory springs. It’s a “great looking” Glock just look at the photos.
 (Using a Lyman digital trigger scale, the trigger breaks at just 3lbs.)
