Unfortunately, the original magazine was missing (probably why it was never fired) but I have located another and have installed it.  I obtained the gun with a removable 40 round metal magazine that will go with the gun, although its probably a better paper weight than anything.  I have only fired a box of 20 rounds through this gun during my ownership.

It's a SIG Sauer P6 9mm, single stack.  Classic SIG DA/SA with manual decocker.  It's roughly the same size of a P228/P229, but thinner thanks to being single stack.  Comes with box and two 8 round magazines

Gun has been 100% for me through a few hundred rounds and is very accurate (see pic below, but keep in mind I was trying a different grip/stance so my shots were going way left...check that grouping though)  This gun was originally used by a Swiss police officer, so it does have holster wear on the slide.  Frame is nice and clean

i am well versed in firearms and this rifle is a tack driver...i can shoot sub moa well beyond 300 yds, and that is not something you can expect right out of the box...the action alone is far easier to run than a normal 700...I do not expect that this rifle will be valuable to someone that is unfamiliar with precision distance shooting and I am not interested in trades...If you are looking to be a serious shooter, please let me know...I am not pressed for cash, I just bought an armalite sass and do not want to see my 700 going unused...I will not just sell it to someone with a half assed offer, i want a firearms owner that will be proud to have this gun and will take care of it. I will provide all applicable ballistics info to give you the best opportunity to shoot sub moa after our transaction is complete....not everyone will understand the value of this rifle, but i dont need them to."

Here is a real beauty This Ruger Security Six .357 Mag revolver is in super shape on this 4"" six shot revolver. The gun is the perfect size in my opinion, not too small and not too big..... PERFECT size for carry and for target shooting. The gun's bore is clean and bright with strong rifling. The rear sight is adjustable and the double and single action trigger pull is fantastic in both modes. The gun shows only slight bluing wear and it is simply fantastic. These are very strong revolvers and this one is the one to get if you want a great .357 Mag. The gun will shoot .38 Special loads as well even the hot .38 Special +P loads that are so popular.

The USC
Derived from the HK UMP, the USC is a civilian utility carbine that uses the classic hard-hitting .45 ACP cartridge. Matched with the simple and ultra-reliable blowback operating system, the HK USC is a radical departure from traditional firearms designs. Extensive use of the same durable, reinforced polymers used on HK's line of military and police arms ensures lightweight and durability. And the highest grade of weapons steel is used where it matters-in the cold hammer forged target barrel and the solidly constructed bolt mechanism. User ergonomics are not sacrificed. The skeletonized buttstock is topped with a comfortable rubber cheek rest and recoil pad. The web of the pistol grip is open for a comfortable shooting handhold. Hard points located on the top and front of the receiver make attachment of optional Picatinny rails easy, allowing almost any kind of sighting system or accessory to be mounted.

Features:
.Tough, light weight, corrosion proof polymer construction
.Molded-in hard points for mounting accessories
.Accessory Picatinny rails for easy mounting of optical sights, lights, and aiming devices
.Rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation
.Easy disassembly for simple cleaning and maintenance

This remanufactured product is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, reloadable, and packaged in 100 round, sealed plasti-packs. It is both economical and precision manufactured by an established American cartridge producer. 

Remanufactured ammunition has been around for decades. Some of the world's best shooters use only remanufactured or custom manufactured ammunition to achieve a level of consistency and optimal ballistics performance that cannot be achieved with mass-manufactured ammunition. Remanufactured ammunition is produced by assembling carefully selected components to include specialty bullets, propellants, primers, and previously spent brass cartridge casings. The bullets, propellant, and primers are always newly manufactured while the brass cartridge casings are typically reprocessed to reduce costs or improve consistency. 

This MBI product is manufactured using only the highest quality products available to ensure consistent ballistics and firing performance. The propellant is manufactured by Hodgdon, the bullets are manufactured at either the Lake City military manufacturing facilities or by Hornady, and the primers are manufactured by either CCI or Winchester. In addition to using only the best available components, MBI ammunition is assembled using some of the most modern electronic press equipment available. Because exceptional consistency is a major factor in creating accurate ammunition, a production facility that uses finely calibrated electronic press technology is key to ensuring that each shooter is well-pleased with the performance of their ammunition. 

Each brass cartridge casing used to produce MBI ammunition is processed by first undergoing a lengthy mechanical cleansing process. Once cleaned, each casing is then re-calibrated by an electronic press to ensure that the final dimensions of each round are within micrometer tolerances. Each casing is then re-primed and re-charged using high-quality primer and propellants. Once the new bullet is seated using a precision-tuned electronic press, each round is hand-inspected to ensure perfection. 

This product is not just remanufactured ammunition. It is ""precision"" remanufactured ammunition for the serious shooter. The fact that it costs less than most new ammunition is simply an added benefit.

This remanufactured product is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, reloadable, and packaged in 100 round, sealed plasti-packs. It is both economical and precision manufactured by an established American cartridge producer. 

Remanufactured ammunition has been around for decades. Some of the world's best shooters use only remanufactured or custom manufactured ammunition to achieve a level of consistency and optimal ballistics performance that cannot be achieved with mass-manufactured ammunition. Remanufactured ammunition is produced by assembling carefully selected components to include specialty bullets, propellants, primers, and previously spent brass cartridge casings. The bullets, propellant, and primers are always newly manufactured while the brass cartridge casings are typically reprocessed to reduce costs or improve consistency. 

This MBI product is manufactured using only the highest quality products available to ensure consistent ballistics and firing performance. The propellant is manufactured by Hodgdon, the bullets are manufactured at either the Lake City military manufacturing facilities or by Hornady, and the primers are manufactured by either CCI or Winchester. In addition to using only the best available components, MBI ammunition is assembled using some of the most modern electronic press equipment available. Because exceptional consistency is a major factor in creating accurate ammunition, a production facility that uses finely calibrated electronic press technology is key to ensuring that each shooter is well-pleased with the performance of their ammunition. 

Each brass cartridge casing used to produce MBI ammunition is processed by first undergoing a lengthy mechanical cleansing process. Once cleaned, each casing is then re-calibrated by an electronic press to ensure that the final dimensions of each round are within micrometer tolerances. Each casing is then re-primed and re-charged using high-quality primer and propellants. Once the new bullet is seated using a precision-tuned electronic press, each round is hand-inspected to ensure perfection. 

This product is not just remanufactured ammunition. It is ""precision"" remanufactured ammunition for the serious shooter. The fact that it costs less than most new ammunition is simply an added benefit.

Marked Stevens, Savage Arms Chicopee Mass. The Stevens Model 77 was the most issued shotgun in Vietnam, according to what I have read about it. The barrel is 26"" and has a good bore.  It is missing the front bead and I have given the gun a coat of flat black paint.  It looks like it is parkerized and is very easily touched up if scratched.  I was going to cut the barrel on this to make a riot gun out of it but was given another gun by my dad.  This gun has a 2-3/4 inch chamber and I think it is a modified choke.  The wood on this gun is nice walnut, and I think that it was made in the 1950's. The gun is in good working order except that it fails to feed every once in a while.  You just have to lift up the lifter when this happens.  I was told that two springs are worn, the lifter spring and the release spring.  These are available at Numrich but I have no desire to try to take this gun apart again or mess around any further as it is a complicated gun to properly assemble.  I would definitely recommend obtaining a manual."

PBM serial number prefix, one of the latest production with none of the earlier G30 trigger bar problems. In other words, it has the newer 4256-1- trigger bar.
Mar 10 2010 test fire date.
Exactly 300 rounds of factory ammunition (Federal, WWB, Speer) has been fired for function testing. Very accurate, soft recoil for a 45cal. No malfunctions or other issues, flawless operation.
It is in excellent, ""like new"" condition. Thoroughly cleaned and inspected before firing. Lubricated (with Gun Butter) per manufacturer recommendations. Doesn't even have the usual ""smilies"" on the barrel (although I can't take full credit for that, the new barrel finish is great).

I'd love to keep it, but I now have a new baby and a young family to support. This would be a great pistol for someone looking for 45cal in a compact, accurate package. $500 FTF. No taxes (or shipping and transfer fees if buying online). Also, no 4473 to fill out if that is important to you.

From another website --
The Oakley M Frame Array includes two shields of pure Plutonite. The gray lens controls reflection and transmission, while the clear lens provides optical armor for night and low light shooting. POLARIC ELLIPSOID geometry maintains razor sharp clarity to keep your focus on the bullseye and a low profile nosepiece won't fragment your field of view.

The Oakley SI M Frame included in the array surpasses ANSI Z87.1 Industrial Standards for high-mass and high-velocity impact protection. The lenses are made of pure Plutonite, a proprietary material that offers the highest level of optical clarity available in eyewear. You get razor-sharp clarity at all angles of view, which maximizes peripheral vision and protection against sun, wind and side impact.

* Features: Shatterproof, scratch-resistant Plutonite polycarbonate lenses can be interchanged
* Polar Ellipsoid lens shape eliminates distortion
* Hammerfang ear stems provide a 3-point fit to comfortably accommodate various head sizes
* Patented hydrophilic silicone earsocks and nosepieces become tacky when wet, so they won't slip down when you perspire
* The eyewear and extra lenses fit into their own special case
* Included Lenses: Clear Lens - All-purpose. Allows the maximum amount of light through for the most accurate representation of your environment.
* Grey Lens - Medium to bright light. Excellent all-purpose lens with enhanced contrast for sunny conditions.

Whether it's dove loads in September or steel shot in November, the Stoeger P-350 will digest them all without so much as a hiccup. And there's even a 13 ounce recoil reducer that screws right onto the tail of the stock bolt to tame the kick of the heavy magnums. The P-350 fore-end assembly features twin action bars for smoother, non-binding cycling.
There are nine different models of the Stoeger P-350 to choose from-an 18-1/2 in. barreled home security model, the Max-4 HDT camo gun for waterfowlers, a Timber HD for turkeys, an APG HD for all around hunting, or the standard, all-purpose black synthetic. In addition, every P-350 field gun comes with five choke tubes, including an extra-full extended turkey choke, so no matter what your game, the Stoeger P-350 has you covered.

It is in excellent condition, about 90% blue, lands and grooves still deep and sharp. All numbers matching, all marked Mauser Waffenfabrik A/ Neckar

Most commonly known as the ""Red Nine"", these pistols were produced during World War One for Prussia, and got their nickname by the large digit ""9"" on the grip. This was done to remind the soldier to not to load the 7.63 rounds into the pistol. There were 150,000 ordered with approximately 137,000 delivered. The serial number on this pistol is 42018, making it early pistol and definitely was delivered during the Great War. The pistol right now is wearing reproduction grips, but I DO have the original grips serialized with the gun. Also included with the pistol is the manual and several original stripper clips. The pistol was last fired in the '50s. The pistol is entirely original and matching, including the stock/holster.

COMMENTS:
Ultra-fast. Ultra-reliable. Ultra-lightweight. It's no wonder the 85s are the most popular family in the Taurus line. They pack them with a combination of customer-requested features and pair them with the .38 Special +P ammo - making them powerful, easy to carry - and lightning-quick to use. For many individuals in Law Enforcement, these are must-have revolvers.

I have around ~ 200 5.56mm 55gr FMJ Rounds that I will throw into the purchase. 100 rounds fired only! I took it to the range once. This rifle was purchased earlier this year (receipt available as proof) and was manufactured late last year per Smith & Wesson verifying this myself. I love this rifle, but due to financial difficulties I am forced to give up some of my possessions. Everything here has been kept cleaned, oiled and stored well. Please read everything twice and take notes and check for yourself that everything, including the extras is being sold here at a ridiculous price. Do your homework and the math and you will see that this is a hell of a deal. Price is firm and I am not looking for trades as I need the money. I prefer to deal with local buyers due to the amount of extras being thrown here and don't want to deal with shipping. Everything looks BRAND NEW, because it's been stored since I purchased it. I took the rifle out to an indoor range once and that was it! I don't have the time and money to enjoy this rifle and would rather just sell it instead of letting it sit there.
