Tactical AR (adjustable stock, forward grip, optic of some kind, etc) - (may have to add depending on whats on it)

Stock AR with cash or maybe another gun of some type?

Long rifle (open to options, mainly a heavier load rifle) and cash

Not really looking to get a handgun so if you offer that expect to add a lot.

Please text me offers at 513-907-4880 or email me at clontzjr@gmail.com

All parts are correct for a pre March 1918 weapon.  Early slide markings, US property mark on the left side of the frame, JMG acceptance mark above the magazine catch, Colt rampant horse at the back of the slide and shorter radius of the recoil spring housing at the front of the slide.

This pistol is in very good condition.  A large amount of original blue remains, approximately 80%.  The wear shows this pistol has spent some time in a holster.  The edges are bright and the finish is spotty on the forward end of the slide and frame.  There is a slight bit of rust pitting in the right side cocking serrations, mostly likely due to corrosion of a brass holster snap.  The finish on the front strap of the grip has mostly been worn away.  A small dent is also present at the front right corner of the slide, this is hardly noticeable and does not effect the function or accuracy of this pistol.

The magazine included is not original.

I used this several times out shooting 600+ yards with a .308. The entire setup is designed to take the hits(even the stand, chains and bolts). If you paint the plate it helps to see your hits through the spotting scope at distance, I haven't painted it since my last trip as you can see. I spend over $80 on the stand building it from parts purchased locally at home depot, the AR500 Plate was purchased online and the mounting chains totaled more than $30.

Build one yourself and spend almost $150 or buy mine, paint the plate and take it to the mountains. These things are great for shooting up close with handguns and ARs also!

Note: The AR plate hangs upside down because of the positioning of the mounting holes. It was meant to be on a stand, not hung. When I take it out, I load the plate and chains in my ruck because it's easier to hike with the bare stand over my shoulders otherwise I would have welded it all in place..."

Chambered in 9x19mm, This gun is rugged and designed with the no-fail striker fire system that Glocks and Springfield are known for.

It is in EXCELLENT condition; has low round count (appox. 150). It has no visual signs of wear; really perfect condition. In fact, this gun has been stored in an airtight and waterless environment for a while, so expect a near new looking gun (without all the cosmoline, of course.)

You would get two factory magazines; one 10rd and the other 17rd. Both pristine condition. Also included is a Fobus Holster.

You would also get a carrying case and approximately 150 rounds of FMJ ammo. If I can find it, I have the original Ruger shipping case it came with too. Pics forthcoming.

I paid full price for the gun... listed at $530 MSRP. I rarely shot it, so it's value is at about $480 + $10 (for case) + ~$60 (ammo). You do the math... I would rather trade up to something else than get cash, but throw something at me, and I might negotiate."

This is a single-stack 6+1 alloy-framed gun in .45ACP. It's about the same size as a Glock 19 and shoots very well, especially considering how small it is for being a .45 (shoots much nicer than my friend's Glock 30, and is smaller to boot). This is a great concealed carry piece that I picked it up not long ago but decided to stick to my HKs.

All German made (unlike the newer P220 Compact).
I was told less than 1000rds through it when I bought it. I put 100 through it myself with no issues.
Comes with 4 factory P245 magazines.
Has factory SigLite night sights that work fine. Not brand-new bright but far from useless.
Couple of small nicks, one on the front of the grip and a couple on the slide that don't penetrate the finish (see pics).

$725. Need to see a WA DL/CPL. Trade for ARs/parts, other guns?

Any questions, feel free to ask. More pictures available here: http://www.machrpm.com/p245

There is a written exam along with a shooting test. You don't need to worry about either test as I give you everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour course. 

I have no minimums on my classes and will NOT cancel them because I don't have enough people for the class. One person is all it takes.

You can bring your own pistol for the shooting portion along with 50 rounds of ammunition. I recommend using a .22 however any caliber is accepted. If you don't have a pistol yet or would just like to borrow mine I have a .22 Ruger.

This is a brand new 7.62x39 Saiga rifle, which was professionally converted by Sierra Arms International from the original “sporting/hunting” configuration to a very affective Assault Rifle platform. This conversion is second to none! 

Professional modifications are as follows: 
Barrel threaded with 14-1 LH threads; Front sight replaced with superior AKM unit; Barrel machined to receive traditional lower hand guard and retainer; Feed ramp installed to receive any AK magazine;
Bolt and carrier modified and polished at contact points for smooth action;
Fire control group replaced with G2 and moved forward; G2 fire control group machined and polished for supreme fit and function; Trigger guard and mag catch replaced with monolithic AKM unit; Pistol grip nut clearance machined into receiver and grip moved forward; Very thick, nearly corrosion proof, mil-spec parkerizing in very dark satin gray. 

Premium features are as follows:
16"" chrome lined barrel; Black US-Made K-Var butt stock, pistol grip, and foregrips; Bulgarian vented gas tube; Indexed AK74 type muzzle brake for increased control; Adjustable AKM front sight with muzzle brake detent; Fitted and mounted cleaning rod; Shepherd’s hook fire control group retainer; Bolt hold-open latch; Adjustable flip up rear sight; Scope mount side rail.

Also includes the following:
Original Russian owner’s manual; Original oil can; Original tool/cleaning  kit, which will fit into K-Var stock; Bulgarian 30 round magazine with steel feed lips.

If you're in the market for an AK47, get yours from the country who created it: the authentic Russian Kalashnikov AK47. This rifle is far superior to cheaper versions that originated from other countries and were most likely rebuilt from a kit. This is a solid and affective rifle, and it will last for decades."

TASER ECDs use replaceable cartridges containing inert, compressed nitrogen to fire two small probes that are attached to 15 foot (4.5 meter) insulated conductive wires. Energy is sent over the wires into the probes, which can penetrate up to two cumulative inches of clothing. The charge is transmitted between the two probes, jamming sensory and motor functions, and inhibiting muscular control. This NMI effect continues in 10 second cycles each time you press the trigger. The X26C ECDs can also be used in direct contact stun mode.

Effective

TASER ECDs are the only devices that allow you to take control of your personal safety by consistently incapacitating aggressive, dangerous people.

Safe

Safer and more effective than other options, such as sprays or direct contact stuns, which require potentially dangerous chemicals or close range to an attacker and often prove to be ineffective on individuals under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.

Keeps You Safe at a Distance

Unlike other options which require you to be close to the target, TASER ECDs are effective at a range of up to 15 feet, which keeps you out of harm's way.

Easy To Use

The TASER X26C has been designed for easy use during high stress deployment situations. Combining a LASER sight and LED light with a quick flip safety, the X26C allows you to respond quickly and effectively to a threat.

Police Proven

The TASER X26C is based on the same design used by law enforcement worldwide. It's designed to be compact and easy to carry and to give a 10 second cycle of incapacitation that gives you time to get in control of a threatening situation and get to safety
