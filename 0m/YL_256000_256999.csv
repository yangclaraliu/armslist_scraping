These species are diurnal and often have brightly-colored bodies. Although all wild dendrobatids are at least somewhat toxic, levels of toxicity vary considerably from one species to the next and from one population to another. Many species are critically endangered. These amphibians are often called ""dart frogs"" due to the Amerindians' indigenous use of their toxic secretions to poison the tips of blowdarts. However, of over 175 species, only three have been documented as being used for this purpose (curare plants are more commonly used), and none come from the Dendrobates genus, which is characterized by the brilliant color and complex patterns of its members. At least that is what I was told by a friend of my other  brother Earl.

In excellent condition, previous owner stated ~200 rounds down the tube and it doesn't appear that it would have more than that. Blueing is in excellent condition and barrel does not show any marks or scuffs. The laminated stock I would rate at a 95%or better, there is one very small mark on the bottom of the stock next to the sling stud, very unnoticeable my camera would not pick it up, other than that is in A+ condition. The rifle has a 24"" stainless ""medium"" contour barrel. Not sure what the twist is. Leupold bases are included. Scope, rings and bipod are not included. I am asking $600.

Kimber Ultra Crimson Carry II - .45 ACP A small, lightweight pistol ideal for concealed or backup carry. Crimson Carry .45 ACP pistols have lightweight aluminum frames for easy all-day-every-day carry. Crimson Trace Lasergrips project a red dot that is visible in virtually any light, a tremendous psychological and tactical advantage that also promotes speed and accuracy under stress. Laser grips can dramatically improve accuracy and reduce time between shots for any level of shooter. Crimson Carry pistols come with Crimson Trace Lasergrips; the finest laser sight available today. Combining that advantage with Kimber quality makes Crimson Carry pistols an unbeatable value. To ensure dependability, Ultra Crimson Carry light weight aluminum frames are machined on the same computer-driven machines and to the same unequaled tolerances as Kimber steel frames. Each model has standard Kimber features like rounded and blended edges, beveled magazine well, extended thumb safety and bumped beavertail grip safety. They fit almost any size hand and point naturally. Best of all, the crisp, clean single action trigger eliminates long travel, heavy pull and the guessing that goes with it. For concealed carry, nothing beats a 1911 – and no 1911 beats a Kimber.

We will also clean and polish the inside of the magazine tube and the follower for improved feeding performance and reliability. The entire action is then treated with a heat applied metal conditioner and lubricant. The gun is reassembled, function checked again, headspace checked and fired for function. The completed action will be smooth and reliable for years to come. Forcing Cone Lenghtning and Barrel Honing & Polishing: We modify the forcing cone using our proprietary profile, then hone and polish the chamber for improved extraction, and hone and polish the forcing cone and bore all the way to the muzzle to remove tight spots and manufacturing marks. The result is approximately 30% reduction in felt recoil and an improvement in the tightness and evenness of the shot pattern that has to be seen to be believed. This is where the greatest gains in barrel performance occur and our barrel performance equals or exceeds anything out there. Mag-Na-Porting: (Except Breacher Barrels) The latest EDM porting system in the industry. Elliptical metering ports electronically cut, not drilled, resulting in reduced felt recoil, reduced muzzle jump and faster follow up shots. No damage to finishes, no bulges or burrs and a diffused muzzle flash/signature in low light. The ultimate Porting System.

Probably have fished more water than I realize. Have come to a juncture in life when one has to make decisions. Sold our boat(s) and doubt I will ever fish again.

The equipment I have is too plentiful to list individually. I will list the rods, each rod is equipped with a pretty decent reel. A few of these bought and never used. All in all a pretty good deal.

Rods:
Shakespeare Lady Fish, 7’ medium action; Daiwa Wave, 7’ medium action; Shakespeare Ugly Stick, Bait Casting, 6’6” medium action, w/Garcia Ambassadeur Royal Express; Shakespeare Ugly Stick, Spinning, 6’ medium action; Bass Pro Lady Lite IM6 Graphite, 6’6” medium action; Shakespeare Sigma 5’ ultra lite; Shimano 5’ ultra lite; Daiwa Power Cast 6’6” medium action, w/Bass Pro Extreme reel model ETX10SLD.

Tackle:
You will have to see the pictures. I have many bags of plastics, 6+ plastic lure boxes which are filled with spinner baits, jigs, ratl traps, Smithwicks, etc. Lots of line, hooks and weights. Also Rapala tools, pliers, hook extractor etc. As you can tell a lot of this stuff has never seen water.

Probably $1000 + worth of fishing stuff. Make me an offer for the lot, not going to sell it piece by piece, that’s just too much work for me. Make a fair offer and we might can make a deal. Don’t bother low balling or try stealing the stuff. I’m not in hurry to sell and if I don’t sell it, it’ll just sit where it is. Thanks for looking. I am located in the Heights area of Little Rock. Will probably add stuff that is not pictured as I find things!

This is a single-action six shooter.  It bears a striking resemblance to a Colt SAA.
As you may know, Beretta makes an excellent variety of shotguns.  The quality of this revolver is something the Baretta Company can be proud of.  If you can't afford a Colt SAA at $1500, you won't do any better than this pistol at 1/4 the price.  The case-hardened frame, the bluing, the rifling and the action is something you can be proud of.

 The AP-9 was an inexpensive, simple to manufacture 9x19mm pistol, designed to capitalize on the market of the Intratec TEC-9 series of guns in the 1980s. It was manufactured by AA Arms and distributed by Kimel Industries, Inc of Indian Trail, NC. The AP-9 became widely available in 1990 and continued until 2001, however sales dropped off and cosmetic changes had to be instituted as a result of the Clinton Assault Weapon Ban of 1994 (officially known as the Omnibus Crime Bill 1994).

Many people confuse the AP-9 with the TEC-9. 

Externally they are similar but there are many small differences, the most obvious being the front sight and the shape of the receiver. Both guns can load and use the same magazine."

This helmet was made using a thick DH-132B ACVC shell, which was drilled for multiple mounting positions for the chinstrap, as shown in the photos - allowing for completely flexibility in fit and comfort.  It includes a Crye NAPE pad rated for level IIIa, size Large/XL.  The shell is lined with ACH velcro discs, and comes with a full set of ballistic pads that can be positioned and removed according to user needs.  The chinstrap is a standard MICH 4-point harness, extremely rugged and stable.  In the back of the helmet is a goggle retention strap for use with eyepro or a cat eyes headband.  The entire outer surface of the shell has been refinished in a desert/arid ""snakeskin"" camouflage pattern using similar color tones and blends as Crye Precision's Multicam pattern for the most effective camouflage possible in arid or temperate environments.

The helmet shell is rated above the ACH with a ballistic V-50 of 2,250fps.  It is above NIJ level IIIa, but still not rifle-proof at level III.  This helmet offers the best ballistic protection available short of the Crye Airframe, and the shell design allows the use of almost any hearing protection or communications headset - I have used it comfortably and effectively with Peltors, Surefire, and Howard Leight.

Please ask any questions, I check frequently and will be happy to help with any concerns you may have."

I am willing to take 100 bucks cash for this rifle today, but here are a few things I am NOT going to do and if you ask the answer is no.

1. I do not have time to go ""test fire"" this rifle with you, I might understand if its a 1000+ dollar rifle but NOT for a cheap .22 rifle. You are more than welcome to inspect the rifle (ie take it apart, inspect it with a borelight, dry fire it with a .22 snap cap, etc) the rifle works and is in damn near new condition.

2. I am not willing to ship this rifle, trade it, or spend 50 bucks in gas driving to sell a 100 dollar rifle, aint gonna happen.

3. If you want this rifle, then you agree to the price. Do NOT waste my time by ""swinging by to take a look"", and if I show up with the gun ready to sell and you decide all the sudden to disregard anything we have agreed upon by saying ""I only brought xx amount of money"" or something similar then it is not a deal and goodbye. I would understand if there is something SERIOUSLY wrong with the rifle, but as I said gun is like new.

4. I WILL NOT SELL THIS GUN TO ANYBODY THAT IS NOT LEGALLY ABLE TO POSSES THIS GUN (ie you are a felon, been convicted of a misdemeanor of domestic violence, been dishonorably discharged, or spent some time in a insane asylum)

I do not want to dissuade potential buyers from this gun by this rant, but this is getting rediculous and I have had such a large influx of people responding with calls and texts (most I might add are literally wasting my time) that the few good people who want to really buy this might have been overlooked. 

I have a Savage Mark II Bolt Action .22 rifle that is equiped with a bsa x4 power scope. Overall condition is very good with few wear marks on the gun, and this gun is pretty accurate (consistently can hit a small sauce pan at 100 yds with bulk walmart .22 ammo). This would make a excellent gift to a son, daughter, cousin, niece, nephew, etc for this christmas. Im only asking 115 for the rifle, and i can be reached either through email or my cell at REDACTED. Thank you and Merry Christmas."

Has had about 200 rounds down the pipe. Trigger has been professionally adjusted down to a crisp, light, 2.5 lb pull which is adjustable. It comes mounted in a Bell & Carlson Medalist Tactical stock ( $225 stock) featuring dual front studs and a very comfortable palm swell pistol grip. Action is free-floated all the way to the recoil lug and in this stock recoil is almost non-existant. 

Very nice starter sniper rifle. I have personally shot this out to 1000 yds at both paper and steel targets with 75gr Hornady BTHP and AMAXs. 

This is for RIFLE, BIPOD, SLING, and STOCK only.

Stock Info:
The new A2 Style Vertical Grip Tactical was designed with one thing in mind .... precision shooting! That's correct, it's half the money plus offers a precision alumininum bedding system that runs from the bottom of the grip to the forward swivel stud.

The vertical grip with comfortable ambedextrous palm swell keeps the hand in precise alignment with the trigger. The forend is widened to 2 3/8"" at the bottom and perfectly flat for great stability off any rest. It also features dual forward studs, one for the sling and an extra for the bipod. The drop-in design is perfect for Police Specials and Heavy Varminters alike and will give you the free-floating barrel everyone seeks right out of the box. Torque the receiver screws to the precision bedding block and you'll see what your barreled action is really capable of. If it don't shoot in this unit it ain't gunna!

Many professionals believe the aluminum bedding block system is the best way to achieve the best out-of-the-box accuracy from any rifle. With good reason: when you take a CNC machined block of aircraft-grade 6061-T6 aluminum and surround it with layers of hand-laid fiberglass and Aramid mats, then encase the entire unit in a virtually indestructable carbon-composite shell the result is not only a unit that will take just about anything your duty can throw at you, but one of the finest fitting precision handles available for todays sporting arms.

The stock is designed for a free-floating barrel and is available in all the finishes that we currently offer, including our web and camouflage patterns. Reliable over a temperature range of -50ºF to + 140ºF and all stocks are covered by a limited lifetime warranty."

Both ESPs sell right now at Guitar Center used for $150 each. Looking to clear out our back room and get my wife a CCW for Christmas. Can email pictures. Thank you

UPDATED: I was not really interested in selling the Llama separately. Mainly either sell the guitars, trade the guitars and pistol in a package deal, or do a straight trade on a 9mm semi auto pistol for the Llama. But if you are solely interested in buying the Llama I will sell it for $350 and I can guarantee you that will be the cheapest price anywhere on the net right now. Please let me know what you think. Thank you

***I pulled out the Llama from its holster to give it a twice over and noticed two smithing marks near a push pin hole. One mark being exactly 1/32th of an inch long and the second being exactly 1/16th of an inch long. So it is not in truly mint condition as I was believing. The blueing is still perfectly in tact. I have reduced the price from $350 to $325 accordingly. Thank you***

UPDATED: I was not really interested in selling the Llama separately. Mainly either sell the guitars, trade the guitars and pistol in a package deal, or do a straight trade on a 9mm semi auto pistol for the Llama. But if you are solely interested in buying the Llama I will sell it for $350 and I can guarantee you that will be the cheapest price anywhere on the net right now. Please let me know what you think.
