Extreme conditions call for an extreme gun. And never before has a rifle this durable and rugged been introduced to the world of hunting. The cutting edge in rifle design, the Model 700 XCR (Xtreme Conditions Rifle) uses Remington's proprietary new TriNyteT Corrosion Control System to make the Model 700 XCR virtually impervious to even the most extreme conditions. The TriNyte System takes firearm protection further than it's ever been before by using proven corrosion-fighting materials and an innovative, state-of-the-art application process. The result is a finish that provides scratch and corrosion resistance far superior to stainless steel alone and better than any other gun on the market.
Designed for shooters by shooters, the Model 700 XCR is built for superior handling in adverse conditions. Its feature laden synthetic stock is not only stylish and comfortable, but a technological marvel. Features include an R3® recoil pad from LimbsaverT - the most effective recoil pad produced today - and patented rubber overmolding technology from Hogue® - a revolutionary technique incorporated into the grip and fore-end areas to provide the surest grip even in the slickest environments. The new standard in rugged durability, the Model 700 XCR Xtreme Conditions Rifle will have you delivering your appointed rounds while the others stay home.


This firearm is in Excellent Condition (99%), with no visible wear or tear. Rilfe has less than 60 rounds through it. 

The reason I am trading it is that I now have a Remington 700 Police in .308, and have no need for two bolt-actions."

All laws will be followed and the appropriate documentation submitted (transfer to my class 3 dealer if applicable). Please have your transfer paperwork ahead of time and or your CCW and picture ID from N.C. or a state W/ reciprocity.

Here is the information from HK's website about the firearm:

The USC:
Derived from the HK UMP, the USC is a civilian utility carbine that uses the classic hard-hitting .45 ACP cartridge. Matched with the simple and ultra-reliable blowback operating system, the HK USC is a radical departure from traditional firearms designs. Extensive use of the same durable, reinforced polymers used on HK's line of military and police arms ensures lightweight and durability. And the highest grade of weapons steel is used where it matters-in the cold hammer forged target barrel and the solidly constructed bolt mechanism. User ergonomics are not sacrificed. The skeletonized buttstock is topped with a comfortable rubber cheek rest and recoil pad. The web of the pistol grip is open for a comfortable shooting handhold. Hard points located on the top and front of the receiver make attachment of optional Picatinny rails easy, allowing almost any kind of sighting system or accessory to be mounted.
Features:

    * Tough, light weight, corrosion proof polymer construction
    * Molded-in hard points for mounting accessories
    * Accessory Picatinny rails for easy mounting of optical sights, lights, and aiming devices
    * Rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation
    * Easy disassembly for simple cleaning and maintenance
    * Ambidextrous safety/selector lever
    * Open, skeletonized buttstock for better grip
    * Oversized trigger guard for easy operation while wearing gloves
    * Sixteen inch cold-hammer forged target barrel

For the folks unfamiliar with a Cavalry Arms lower:

These receivers are injection molded from glass filled nylon 6, a polymer material very similar to that used by other firearms companies. Polymer offers unsurpassed corrosion resistance, finish durability. and is significantly lighter than aluminum based receivers.

They are molded in two halves and assembled using a linear vibration welding process. Linear vibration welding forms the two halves into one solid piece. Every contact surface between the two halves is bonded together with a weld that is even stronger than the parent material.

Injection molding allows for more cost effective and faster production of parts of consistent quality. Production cost savings are passed onto the consumer.

CAV-15 MKII Receiver Features:

    * A1 Length integral Stock (5/8"" shorter than A2) with sling loop. 13"" Length of Pull.

Much more accurate than any AR based .308 and lighter too. 

The description from FNH: ""Descending from the legendary Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), the FNAR puts autoloading speed and bolt-action accuracy into one powerful package. Chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO (308 Win.), the FNAR is available with either a 16"" or 20"" cold hammerforged MIL-SPEC fluted barrel with hard-chromed bore and recessed target crown. The matte black synthetic pistol grip tactical stock is fully adjustable. The FNAR is equipped with multiple MIL-STD 1913 rails for mounting your choice of optics, lights and lasers. The FNAR is the ideal competition and practical rifle when both speed and power are your top priorities.""

This is the light version with a 20"" fluted barrel. Included is a Nikon Monarch 4-16X42 Side Focus scope on a Wilson Combat one piece mount for easy zero repeatability. Also included are FIVE extra, very hard to find, $74 magazines which hold 20 rounds. The rifle retails for $1821 but usually sells online for around $1450-$1500. With the included $450 scope, $100 mount and $370 in extra mags I have more than $2370 in this exceptional rifle. All the customizable combs and recoil pads as well as the shims and factory case are also included.

It comes with the rifle itself, shoulder strap, internal cleaning kit and rod, (2) 30 round magazines, (1) 10 round magazine, and a new case.  On a scale of 1-10, I would give this rifle an 8.6 in terms of cosmetics and a 10+ in terms of functionality.

399 rounds through it, you ask?? When new, I purchased 1000 rounds to go out shooting...I had 601 rounds left when the time came to trade it for .223 ammo (for my AR-15)  I have 50 rounds left that are going to be sent with the gun so you can start shooting right away.  Shipping should be $30 for the box and shipping (no handling charge); although, I would prefer to meet FTF.  This gun will only be sold to a qualified individual will only be sold to a AK-47 legal state.

All have been refurbished, everything checked out. Any laptop over $200 is covered under warranty for 30 days except the batteries (they are depletable, like the ones in your car). However if you need a battery for one you bought from me (or even one you didn't) let me know and I will get you in touch with my vendor(s)... they are about 1/2 price of what batteries plus charges. These all have fresh corporate OS and utility packages installed: OS, Symantec A/N (corporate never expires), office 2k3 or 2k7 (depends on model but 2K3 has the compatibility patch so it will work with 2k7 files). Some also have Nero 7/9 (depends on the OS), power DVD, ANYDVD/CloneDVD/CloneCD. ALL LAPTOPS HAVE WIFI!

Glock has discontinued the OD green frames, so get them while you can!

You're probably asking what the SGT means.  I have no clue and Glock really didn't have an answer for me either, but there are factory upgrades with this G17.  It is not a Gen4 or RTF2 frame.  The frame set-up is identical to that of the Glock 34.

Factory upgrades (Glock parts, installed by Glock at the factory):
Competition trigger package
Rounded smooth wide trigger (not the pyramid step trigger on the G19)
Extended magazine release
Extended slide stop
OD green frame

This was purchased a few months ago to use as a backup to my G34 for IDPA shooting and I decided to get another G34 after having other IDPA folks interpret the weapon failure rule.  It has less than 700 rounds though it and is in excellent condition.

Comes with (2) 17 round mags (Gen3 mags), hard case, loader, paperwork, brush, rod, papers.  If you were to purchase one and try to get these upgrades aftermarket you would find there's about $150-$200 worth of upgrades (parts and labor), add that to the retail price of a Glock 17 and the price could have been as high or higher than $600...obviously I'm not asking that.

$550

I will consider partial trades on this, depending on the item (ammo, other handguns, rifles, shotguns), however I would prefer to sell this outright.

Face to face required.  CCW holders preferred, must have ID and/or CCW in hand at time of transaction.  Due to the BATFE's recent attempts to go after private sellers I now require transfer through a local FFL holder for those who do not have a valid CCW.  If you have a valid CCW permit (out of State is fine w/ valid Missouri ID), you will receive a signed bill of sale from me that you must also sign to protect us both.

Need a shotgun AND a 22LR?  Don't want to spend money on 2 guns?  
You're in luck, this matched pair is Like New with the original box and carrying case, I bought it last Christmas and have shot it once. You can put the 22 barrel on and have a great, accurate rifle. The sights are dialed in and ready to go. Single shot action makes the perfect training tool/ ammo saver. Make every shot count! I really like the solar sights on this 22 because you just line up the green and red dots and you're on target. A great way to shoot open sights and much easier than iron sights. You can also put a scope on the 22. Are the leaves a little thick for Squirrel hunting? Put the 20 gauge shotgun barrel on and give yourself a great chance at getting a bushy tail. 20 gauge light loads are recoil friendly and shooting a .410 is expensive and frustrating because of small buckshot patterns. 

You can break this down and put it in a sleeping bag, the back of your truck, you can carry it around like a gym bag or just stick it next to the tent. 

I will also include 50  Shotgun shells   FREE

Comes with original box and soft carrying case.

                                            GUN REVIEW
SIG Sauer pistols are well known for their world class, state-of-the-art, ""to hell and back"" reliability and the SP2022 is no exception. It is likely the most under appreciated gun in the SIG Sauer lineup with most of the attention going to the P-series pistols. The SP2022 is every bit as good. It is a polymer framed gun built with quality. It is rugged and it is reliable. God's own Gunsmith, Bruce Gray carries the SP2022 in .357 SIG as his duty pistol. A man that can build anything he wants has great confidence in his SP2022. That speaks volumes. Whats more, it is not as expensive as the other SIGs. Lockup is solid with very little slide-to-barrel and slide-to-frame play. Slide operation is smooth with no noticeable stiffness."

This is a model 1895 Chilean Mauser in 7mm Mauser (7x57mm) in Very Good shape. The wood has some handling marks but is solid with a beautiful tiger stripes. The bolt does not match but rest of the rifle does. It does have discreet import marks. The metal is excellent with a blued receiver and barrel in the white. The crest has not been removed. The maker's marks are:

MAUSER CHILENO MODELO 1895
DEUTSCHE WAFFEN - MUNITIONSFABRIKEN
BERLIN

The bore is quite good . The lands are sharp and bright and the grooves are good, a little frosty. The bolt does not close on a NO-GO gauge so there is definite shooter potential.
The ammo is surplus made by FN in Belgium. There are 4 boxes for a total of 400 rounds. It is very clean with clean brass.

It has the neck protector, groin protector w/ level III plate, level III plates front and back in the vest, and D.A.P.S (deltoid-shoulder protection).  The level III plates can stand up to 7.62 ball ammo, and with the plates out the kevlar vest will stop pistol rounds and absorb some energy from larger rounds. It is size medium, I am just over 6', around 185lbs, and it fits me--but I am probably about the max height for it, you could fit a slightly bigger chest size.  If you took the groin plate out maybe a little taller, the issue is the awkward placement of the groin plate if you are any taller.  The vest is 100% unused.  It has been tried on but never worn outside--so no sweat, rips, etc. 

I have been told the vest, plates, and groin protector is worth around $900, and the D.A.P.S. run another $200.  I will not separate any of this!!

I will take $800 cash for all of the above.  There is one on gunbroker WITHOUT the plates for $950 as of 8/27.

I bought this pack used a few months ago, loaded it and have stored it in my truck. These packs are huge and bomb proof and I've had three of them in the past. I am simply going with another color at this time so this one is going to find a new home. As stated it is used, but in great shape. It does NOT have the waste belt. I received it that way from the seller whom never got back to me about the belt. The zipper pulls have been replaced with OD 550 cord and the drag handle has been wrapped in 550 cord also, both of which can be undone. Below is a webiste I found about the pack and four pics that the seller sent me. Google for other sites for your own research if you'd like and I can also send some more pics if needed when I'm off. I will throw in as many of the Gray color Grim-lock carabiners as I can find. I'll have to check when I get off.

I would work on trade toward  compact .45 1911 style.  The only reason this pistol is for sale, is I ended up with two.  

This pistol comes with all the original equipment: two magazines, two safety keys, carrying case, manual, and box with matching serial number.

If you are looking for a pocket pistol, you need to check this out.  Most .380s operate on the blow back system, which requires a heavy slide and strong recoil spring.  The 738 utilizes the locked breech system like larger caliber pistols, thus the weight can be held to a minimum.  Since it is so light and easy to conceal, mine is with me all the time.  

Taurus tried to make a carrying case to make concealment easier in warm weather.  The black belt case looks like you are carrying a 1970's model calculator.  The pistol fits so nicely in a pocket, that is my carry mode of choice.

Below is from the Taurus web site:

Make way for the lightest Taurus ever created! The 10.2-ounce 738 TCP is not only the lightest semi-auto in the Taurus line; it's lighter than any of our small frame revolvers too! The 738 TCP offers 6+1 shots of .380 ACP, a durable polymer frame and low-profile fixed sights. You have to feel it to believe it!
