Kicking around the thought off selling my beloved DPMS SASS 308. There's been only 15 rounds shot from it (I cleaned the bore after every round). It would come with a case, 2 mags, bipod, flip up sights, rail covers, & manuals.

Additions would be a MAGPUL UBR stock, Heavy Buffers CAR buffer & spring, and a Hogue monogrip.

$1900 would take it home.

""PRICE DROP"" Cash price $1800

 I would be interested in a partial trade for a Ruger Gunsite 308 or similar.

She-who-must-be-obeyed says it has to go if I want to equip the eldest with a competition rifle. So here we go…

This rifle is of the older, better style with a 21.5” barrel and 18 round magazine. They aren’t making those anymore, unfortunately, due to idiotic laws limiting magazine capacity. So here we have a “pre-ban” plinking and small game rifle. This year in particular has a nice spring-loaded cap for the brass tube magazine, which locks into place positively. Unfortunately earlier models don’t have positive lock. I guess that brass tube is a sought-after feature, since newer models don’t have it.

Accuracy is exactly what one would expect of Marlin’s wonderful rimfire barrels, and the trigger has been worked on to break cleanly at 4 lbs. The squirrel stock is apparently becoming a sought-after option. This one has some scratches and dings, but feels very nice in the hand and comes to the shoulder beautifully for an adult. Of course it has the lovely lines this rifle is in part famous for. These traits combine to make this rifle feel like a “real” rifle, not a kid’s toy. The only real weakness with this rifle is the rear sight – I guess Marlin figured everyone would put scopes on these. Maybe they’re right, since the barrel seems to justify some optics. 

I’m aware that one can buy a brand-new Model 60 for $170 or so, but it will be $200 by the time you pay for transfer and all that nonsense. Worse, you don’t get the longer barrel or higher capacity, and you’re stuck with a crappy plastic stock. This was made back when they made real rifles out of real wood.

The usual legal nonsense…Face to face only, bill of sale and WI driver’s license required."

Overview:

The most durable hunting rifle ever built. Featuring our TriNyte® Corrosion Control System, the introduction of the Model 700 XCR in 2005 stretched the previous durability limits of stainless steel. And for 2010, the Model 700 XCR II is redefining its looks as well. The stainless steel barrel and receiver are now coated with matte black TriNyte for a more classic look with less glare for superior stealth. It's every bit as impervious to extreme conditions, with the same proven track record in accelerated saltwater testing that opened the world's eyes to the power of our patented technology. Simply put, TriNyte delivers scratch and corrosion resistance dramatically superior to standard stainless steel as well any protective coating by any other manufacturer.

The Model 700 XCR II is also optimized for sure handling in adverse climates. Its feature-laden olive drab green synthetic stock is a technological marvel that looks and feels the part with patented Hogue® rubber overmolding featured at the grip and fore-end areas. These revolutionary enhancements give you a positive grip in the slickest environments. And shots are made infinitely more comfortable with our SuperCell™ recoil pad - the most effective on the market today. Our X-Mark Pro® Trigger System gives you a level of crispness and shot control once only available through high-dollar customization.

As far as things I like to trade for, I don't like 'new' things. I like things with dings and scratches and a little character to them, a gun that looks like it has stories to tell. Granted, I want it to be functional and not a piece of junk, but they don't have to be 'pretty'

Sharp as Saladin’s legendary blade, the sleek, classically curved Cold Steel® Scimitar® places the power of the sword in your pocket.
Our craftsmen have captured the timeless quality of superior cutlery and united it with the finest in modern materials. The result is a dazzling, high impact folding linerlock® like no other knife available.
The Scimitar® blade is hollow ground stainless steel, honed to razor sharpness and features the famous curve of its ancient namesake. Painstakingly designed to facilitate the draw cut, the most effective cutting stroke known to man, the blade also features a needle sharp point which pierces at the slightest touch.

Superior engineering combines traditional appeal with the latest Western technology in the contoured Zytel® and steel frame handle designed exclusively by Lynn Thompson for the Cold Steel® Scimitar.® The pistol grip handle facilitates all types of forward grips, including the saber, quarter saber and hammer grips. Its sleek curves, finger grooves and checkering settle naturally and securely into the hand, maximizing the user’s ability to control both the edge and the point. Reverse or palm reinforced grips are mastered with ease, making the pistol grip shape of the Cold Steel® Scimitar® handle one of the most versatile and user-friendly ever devised. A hard-hitting ball shaped pommel contributes to the Scimitar’s® rock steady grip and versatility. The pommel can be used as a striking tool to deliver less than lethal blows to nerve centers and soft targets. It can also serve as a secondary grasping point, allowing the user to extend his reach by as much as three inches.

Lock strength is critical in a high performance knife, and the Scimitar® is head and shoulders above the rest. We have equipped the Scimitar® with a state-of-the-art titanium linerlock® for maximum strength and durability. The strength of titanium is peerless in the cutlery industry, and tests on this mechanism resulted in it holding 100 pounds without collapsing, far exceeding the load-bearing ability of our competitors.

A pocket clip makes it a snap to carry and access quick as a flash. Feel the extraordinary power of history’s most famous sword design in a folding knife of unequaled versatility- and put it in your pocket - with Cold Steel's Scimitar®.

Cz 82. 9/18 with 2 mags , holster, and box 
The CZ 82 is a compact semi automatic pistol made for the Czechoslovakian military with the designation ""Vz. 82"", ""Vz"" is an abbreviation for ""vzor"", which translates to ""model.""

Manufactured by the Czechoslovak firm Ceská zbrojovka the vz. 82 replaced the 7.62x25mm Tokarev vz. 52 pistol in Czechoslovak military service in 1983. It is a compact, double-action, semi-automatic pistol with a conventional blowbackaction. This type of action allows the barrel to remain solidly fixed to the frame, resulting in improved accuracy over pistols with pivoting barrels (like the U.S. M1911 series). The low bore axis of the vz. 82 provides for less muzzle rise and quicker follow-up shots. For added convenience, both the frame-mounted thumb safety and the magazine release are ambidextrous. The vz. 82 was the first service pistol to feature both these features. The bore is chrome plated, which gives it three advantages: longer barrel life, resistance to rust from the use of corrosive ammunition, and ease of cleaning. Another feature of this pistol is the use of polygonal rifling in the barrel bore. This replaces the traditional lands and grooves rifling design with a rounded, smooth polygonal pattern which has a more ""hills and valleys"" appearance.

The vz. 82 was added to the US government's ""Curio and Relic"" list with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE) in February 2007, after an individual wrote a letter to the ATF attaching a letter from a federal museum curator who stated that the vz. 82 had ""museum interest"" as a curio and relic.

This is the Military and Police model with the Trjicon 24/7 SX night sight front post and the heavier duty stainless steel cylinder and scandium frame, its NOT the 340 PD model.  There is a big difference.  

This model only weights 13.3 ounces 

This model has been shot only 60 times ever.  50 of those times were a box of .38 special light loads and 10 rounds of .357 magnum.  Shooting .357 was actually very pleasant and I carried .357's in it when I was out and about.  This gun will come with its original box.

It does have a slight ding on the right side rear sight channel.  The pics will show this.  There are also some light handling marks as I carried this gun at times.  

I have had this handgun checked out by a master firearms instructor and gunsmith.  It is in great condition.   This would make a great carry piece.  I could barely tell it was in my pocket and sometimes forget it was there.  

$600 plus $20 shipping to your FFL.  

This gun lists brand new at over $750-$800 so here is a chance to get a great gun at a resonable price. 

No trades other than Colt 1911's

The meaning of ""Ku"" has long been a subject of speculation, with most experts concluding that these were a late war Luftwaffe contract, that was assembled with substandard parts, hence the use of the ""Ku"" or ""Kummerrer"" markings behind the serial number, indicating leftover or mis-sized parts. While others have theorized that these were assembled by the Krieghoff factory using left over Mauser parts. In either case there were only approximately 5000 total produced making these fairly scarce.
Pistol has a serial numbered barrel with 2 serial numbers, first one is punched out with O's, second does not match the rest of the gun, only other part that is mis matched is the take down leaver, it is marked 41 instead of 40, the mis matched parts fir the senerio for this gun as they were made out of left over parts."

967,http://www.armslist.com/posts/481967,For Sale:  Browning 4X Rimfire Rifle Scope,"Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 200,"Listed On: Sunday, July 22, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a Browning 4X scope made by Redfield.  It has the ¾” tube and I left the attached rings in place.  I’m not a collector so I would like it to go to someone who can appreciate its collectible status.

I removed it from a 1971 model Browning BL-22 I purchased that was well cared for.  The optics are clear and crisp and there is no discernable damage to the finish.  There were no lens covers (and I don’t know that there ever were).  Because I did not attempt to remove the rings I do not know if there are any mounting marks beneath.

The stamping on the reticle housing is not worn, but it was apparently not stamped uniformly deep enough for a really consistent inlay of the gold fill.  If you turn it you can see the lettering OK.  Both plastic adjustment covers are also in excellent shape.  

This Browning 4x Rimfire scope was made between 1965 and 1976. FOV is 24 feet at 100 yards.  Evidently when these scopes were marketed under the Redfield name they were called the Sport-STER 4. The STER apparently stood for Standard Eye Relief.  The ocular bell was smooth- not a serrated ringed design like Redfield.  Otherwise, it’s supposed to be the same scope.  The diminutive dimensions make for a really nice look on the smaller lever action.  

This is a collectible scope though it is still a really nice optical instrument.  I just think it should be with someone who can appreciate it more appropriately.  Otherwise it is destined to end up with a nephew who will just sell it for $10 in beer money.

This scope looks to be in about a 98% condition."
