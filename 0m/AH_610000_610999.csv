I still have the original Warranty card that lists the date as 1974/75. 

Please do not bother contacting me unless you have your New Jersey F.I.D. card and a New Jersey Permit To Purchase Handgun form. Thanks :-)

I bought this gun from a retired NY officer who used it as a shield gun. It has performed flawlessly and no issues, except for an occasional loosening of the plunger from constant firing. Simple to fix, all I had to do is just tighten it after 50 or so rounds fired.

I have attached several pictures listing everything that is included - The original box and foam inserts, the original warranty card, two Taurus manuals, Model 66 Manual/insert and assorted .38 Special and .357 magnum rounds. There are 38 rounds of Blazer .38 special lead nose bullets, 25 rounds of Remington .38 special, 7 rounds of Armscor .357 magnum and 13 rounds of Remington .357 magnum included.

As you can see in the pictures, the bore is shiny and bright with minimal wear - the overall condition of the gun is very good with no major or minor dings or scratches on the steel, and the wood grips are also in excellent condition.

I do not know how many rounds were fired by the owner before me, but I personally have only put about 150-200 assorted .357 magnum and .38 special rounds through it and have never had one issue. It shoots dead on, a lovely shooter and probably the best Taurus overall I have ever had the privilege of shooting. 

Selling because I really am not interested in owning a revolver at this point, and am sticking to semi-autos. 

I'm fairly firm on the $350 price since it is in excellent condition, has all the original materials, shoots fantastic and also includes some ammunition. 
I would be open to a trade for a rifle or shotgun, but would prefer cash. However, I would be willing to listen to any offer! :-)

The Desert Warrior also has an extended ambidextrous thumb safety, plus a short (military length) guide rod for fast takedown. Kimber G-10 grip panels ensure a positive grip regardless of conditions, and a lanyard ring offers additional retention options. Standard Kimber features like match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing ensure unequaled accuracy. Warrior pistols include a 7-round magazine with extended bumper for fast, positive loading, as well as an extended ambidextrous thumb safety that allows fast operation with either hand. The best pistol to carry is a 1911, and the best 1911 is a Kimber.

This is probably the finest concealed carry revolver ever made. These were made in limited quantities by Smith & Wesson's Performance Center.

I put exactly 93 rounds through this in one range session right after I bought it new in 2008, and it's sat in the safe ever since. I use and carry nothing but semi-autos, so it's time to find this a new home.

- Tritium front site
- Performance Center action job gives a smooth DA and crisp SA trigger
- 7-shot cylinder factory-machined for moon clips (2 included) for speed reloads
- ported barrel to lessen recoil
- Rosewood checkered combat grips on a rounded grip frame
- locking Performance Center case

It is tough, absolutely dependable and very accurate. Both slide and frame are machined from solid steel and wear Desert Tan KimPro II, a non-reflective finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to wear, salt and the elements. The Desert Warrior also has an extended ambidextrous thumb safety, plus a short (military length) guide rod for fast takedown. Kimber G-10 grip panels ensure a positive grip regardless of conditions, and a lanyard ring offers additional retention options. Standard Kimber features like match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing ensure unequaled accuracy. Warrior pistols include a 7-round magazine with extended bumper for fast, positive loading, as well as an extended ambidextrous thumb safety that allows fast operation with either hand. The best pistol to carry is a 1911, and the best 1911 is a Kimber.

You know who else thinks so? Ted F-ing Williams, that's who. Why else would he put his name on it? Certainly not for the purposes of endorsement revenue. How dare you even think that!

I learned to shoot with this thing before I could read. I have valiantly defended my grandmother's pear tree from furry perpetrators with this weapon and thereby earning many delectable pear pies in the process. 

It's accurate and hits like a Mack Truck. When I say it's accurate, I do mean accurate. Has great sights and a crisp trigger break. There are only two downsides to this: 1) It's heavy, but built to last. 2) It's single-shot, but that's all you'll need, that is unless there is an army of bushy-tailed vermin conducting a coordinated attack on what should become your delicious pear pies. 

It's in excellent shape. Bluing is all there except for the pellet cover slide. It has been well maintained and has many years of life left in it. It also comes with a very worn box and a cool tin of pellets (oxidized so don't use them) which I never used but kept. 

This is a rare piece and the prices on these things have been all over the map. I picked the mid-point but will entertain serious offers. 

On a side note, while my father taught me to shoot with this, it's not really meant for kids. The grip is too big for most kids. 

The options don't allow me to select the correct information, so the description here is correct."

The stock triggers on these are horrible, so I had it replaced with a Huber Anti-Friction Ball Trigger, installed by John Huber himself. It’s the Match Grade Black Teflon model. It’s fully adjustable for creep, over-travel and ball height. It’s currently listed as $80 on his website, but I only paid $65. This is a sweet set-up... this trigger is as nice as any I’ve felt on any hunting rifle, etc. (YES-- I still have the original trigger.)

With the sale, I’ll also include:
125 rounds of military FMJ on stripper clips ($45 value)
20 rounds 150gr Wisconsin Cartridge Company PSP ($20 value)
11 rounds 170gr Federal Power-Shok Soft Points ($25 new, 11 rds = $13.75 value)

This gun was only fired 54 times! I bought this several years ago from a friend of mine, and it was still covered in cosmoline. I have too many guns, and never shoot this one-- it’s time for a new home.

It's one of the last good steel ones that Winchester made before switching design and metals to a cheaper easier to make and therefore crappier gun.
It's in good shape, has had a williams peep added but other that that it's stock. I'd give it an overall rating of 85% with good blueing and stock.
The action is tight and this rifle functions excellent. 
this in NOT a collector gun, it's being list and price as a great vintage shooter.

Cannon - Environment Control System: Climate conditions inside a safe can vary greatly from external surroundings. Trapped air within the security enclosure will tend to drop in temperature. With no escape or distribution of this cold air, items within the safe can be come vulnerable to damage by liquid condensation caused by increased humidity factor. GunSaver heats to a surface temperature of less than 130 degrees Fahrenheit. Because of its unique design, it circulates warm dry air throughout the gun safe on a continuous basis. This means each and every internal surface is continuously bathed in warm DRY air. This is the key to the operation of the GunSaver. It maintains all parts 2 to 3 degrees warmer than the room, thus practically eliminating the possibility of condensation and the resultant rust and corrosion of metal parts, not to mention the mold and mildew associated with dampness and humidity. The low, even temperature will keep your guns nicely preserved."

Improves Accuracy, Functioning; Elimnates Frame Cracking From Recoil
Easy-to-install kit instantly improves cycling, reliability and accuracy without modifying the frame or the slide. Exclusive, injection-molded, polyfiber buffers slip onto the guide rod be- tween the head and spring and keep the slide from hitting the frame. Prevents expensive frame damage and softens the felt recoil of high power competition loads. Full-length guide rod keeps the recoil spring straight for smoother functioning and longer spring life. Together they provide consistent barrel lockup and increased accuracy.

This rifle is a beauty and I still have the original barrel for it, just need to locate it! I will include the original barrel with the rifle if I can locate it for no extra charge. This rifle is a tack driver and has had only 15 rounds through it since being rebuilt in the current setup. I did a M1D Clone because I always loved the D but wanted to be able to shoot one and not feel bad when I took it hunting. This is a beautiful rifle that someone can shoot and enjoy, if bought FTF I will also provide some Hornady Ammo for the Garand. If rifle needs to be shipped I will charge actual shipping charges."

This is a rock river varmint with a 18 inch barrel with a skeleton rock river stock.  I have it topped with a nikon m223 3-12x42 scope ontop of a rockriver highrise cantilever mount.  This rifle will consistently shoot sub MOA with decent ammo.  I have around 100 rounds through this and purchased it new in August for 2200.  I do not enjoy taking advantage of the current AR situation like some people and raising the price to way more than I payed for it.  That being said I do think that 2100 is a fair price considering military style weapons are soon to be banned....
