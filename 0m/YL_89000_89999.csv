For those of you unfamiliar with the tripower line, it is a red dot sight but uses a combination of batteries, fiber optic, and tritium to achieve its brightness.  Furthermore it is not a dot reticle but a chevron aiming point.  It's got a little silver going on in the adjustment screws, aside from that it's great.  I tried to show it in the pic, but it's not huge so that's the best it comes out.  

It sits in a Larue cantilever mount, which costs 130 on its own.  Larue makes excellent mounts, which can quick detach with the throw of a single lever, and re-attach just as easily with usually less than one MOA difference."

It has had a mount upgrade, a GG&G quick-detachable throw-lever upgrade. Decide you don't want it for the moment to switch to a magnified scope? No problem, just throw the lever over, the Eotech pops off, when you want it back on just throw the lever back over it's that simple. It will even generally hold a zero to within .5 MOA or so, no need to rezero!  This optic is in excellent condition, with only a pair of tiny silver nicks on the protective hood which seperate it from looking new.

If you are unfamiliar with this optic, it is a very sturdy, reliable, fast, and effective holographic red dot sight. It features a 1 MOA dot inside a 65 MOA circle, meaning the dot is one inch wide at 100 meters. It is adjustable for several brightness setttings. What's best about this optic that seperates it from Wal-Mart specials is that it is very sturdy. Eotech's are commonly purchased by servicemembers for use on their duty rifles overseas, because they are sturdy, reliable, and very fast on target. 380 and a pick-up in the Stillwater area please.

I have only fired two 17rd mags through it. I have no problem in keeping this Beretta, but my friend recently got a Glock 22 and after looking over it I think it gave me Glock fever.

The Beretta is the ""Type F"" model with the manual safety and de-cocker. It has the rotating barrel that all the full size PX4s have as well. The recoil is very manageable compared to other 9mms I have shot. It comes with two 17rd magazines and I have a paper that can be sent in to Beretta to get two more magazines. The gun will also come with everything shown in the picture. I have 66 rounds of Federal American Eagle 115gr FMJ to go with it. The white stuff on the slide guides and slide is Mil-Comm grease. I clean all my guns with CLP and use mil-comm to lube.  I just got this gun in November and have only been out to shoot it once so far and have only put 34 rounds through it (It started to snow really hard when I was shooting so I quit early). Never had one FTF or FTF. It shot just like a Beretta should. You can tell from the feed ramp this gun has been shot very little.

FTF with Ohio ID

I would like a Glock in 9mm or 45ACP. (NO .40 S&W). Preferably a Glock 17, 19 or 21 but I am open to offers just as long as it is NOT chambered in .40 S&W. I prefer military caliber pistols always. For the right deal I also have a $100 American Eagle Outfitters gift card.

This is a used but very well cared for Austin&Halleck mountain rifle.

I purchased this muzzleloader new about 5 years ago. I shot it probably about 100 times. Always loved shooting it then I moved to the city about 3 years ago so I haven't shot it since. I've cleaned it a couple of times but I haven't shot it. It's a .50 caliber with 1:66 twist, excellent round ball gun. I use 0.18 patches. It will also come with nice leather possibles bag and powder horn, both used very little. Also about 100 round balls, about 200 0.18 patches, 1 pound of unopened triple seven ff powder and a capping tool, brass powder meassure, ball starter and patch worm. Everything you need to shoot and maintain this gun comes with it."

Beautiful patina finish. Smooth as butter action, I mean really smooth,. The 1892 is the Cadillac of the Winchester Lever actions, and this one is especially smooth. The old cowboy who originally owned it must not have fired it too much and kept it in good shape. Desirable “widow's peak” hammer (see picture). Someone at some point has cut back the barrel and mag tube (see pictures for details), otherwise I'd be trying to sell this one to a collector for big money. Has been keeping in a safe for years protected top to bottom with ballistol. Someone needs to buy this beauty and have fun shooting it.  It would make a very nice cowboy action shooter.  The bore is fairly bright and in excellent condition. Has good rifling.   The length from the tip of the barrel to the receiver is 22 1-4"". The overall barrel length is 22-7/8"" (from end to bolt face).  See pictures for condition.

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or blackened finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

All are shot very little and have bright bores and rifling, I've cleaned them often and taken good care of them, I just can't afford the ammunition for shooting and I'm not much for hunting other than for Coyotes.

800 cash obo for all, trade bolt guns only for an SKS.
I'll trade all for any other rifle I have listed, or for one I take interest in.
I'm not interested in bolt actions, shotguns, small caliber rifles or handguns, I'm wanting to trade up for a semi automatic rifle only.

I collect old battle rifles, but at this point I'm looking more to collect semi automatics than bolt actions because I had surgery on my right hand not to long ago and it acts up painfully when I operate my bolt guns.
Doesn't have to be an outrageously tactical gun, I'm only looking for a gun of equal value but if you'd like to trade me something I have listed in my trade for section I'd be more than happy to do so.
I can pass a background check and present valid Missouri ID and receipts of purchase with my name on them for each of these guns from the places I bought them.
I will give you all the ammo I have for each with the trade, which is about a box of 20 each, I do not have any .308 ammo currently and I can drive to meet you halfway or come right to you if you're close enough.

I can throw in guitars or guitar effect pedals for the right deal if you're interested in them, or I can throw in an xbox 360, I don't have the cash to spare right now or else I'd throw cash in instead.

It has been in my family for many years but, due to some financial circumstances, I find myself forced to sell.  I'm not an expert in such matters, but I'd rate the gun approx. 85% in finish and 95% in function (I've only had it to the range a small handful of times in 10 years and have had three failure-to-eject using cheap ball ammo).  There is some bluing wear shown on the outside of the gun on the slide, but overall it's in fantastic shape for its age-a rebluing or restoration specialist could definitely make it perfect.   It is being sold with one original magazine.

Below is a link containing a lot of information on the particular model (including fun facts like General Patton used to carry one in WWII).  As per the standards described on the site, the gun was manufactured between 1918-1921 and would make an excellent piece for a collector.  The same model listed on Gunbroker without reserves are priced between $650-$1100, but I am asking $600 to hopefully facilitate a quick sale and not a lot of lowballing.  I would be willing to entertain a partial trade for a subcompact in .380 or 9mm (Ruger LCP, Kel-Tec, etc) but I will need $300 cash at minimum in addition.  I know there are some people out there that like to email and offer 50% of the asking price-- if this is you, please save both of us the trouble and don't do it.  I do have some things I need to take care of, but I will not just give the gun away.

Please don't hesitate to email me with any questions, specific picture requests, etc.  If, for some reason, I cannot get the pictures to load on the ad I'll be happy to email them to you.

Thanks a lot!
