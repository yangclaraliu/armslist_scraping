The seat and bench of the Big Game Swivel Action Shooting Bench swivels 360 degrees, so you can find the most stable shooting position no matter what type of terrain you're on. Once you find that position, lock the rest in place with the swivel lock for a steady shot. Made out of steel, the bench has a weight rating of 300 lbs. but weighs just 39 lbs. itself, making for easy transport and setup. The 29 x 29 inch bench top has extended armrests on both sides, so you have a place to lean even if you're a left handed shooter. The 2 inch thick seat is 12 inches W x 14 inches D, so it gives you plenty of space to get seated just right just before you start shooting. The versatile gun rest accommodates all shooters and is adjustable to nearly any position. The rest is coated with nonscratch rubber to protect your firearms. The bench top is covered with padded vinyl and has two shell gear pouches to hold spent cartridges, or other shooting accessories."

Quite a bit of stuff in one place.  I have personally hit 18x18"" steel with all 3 of these rifles at 300m standing - repeatedly. 

all three rifles are in great shape and all chambered in 6.5x55swede - the greatest cartridge on Earth in my honest opinion. great bores and great shooters.  AG-42b with lighter stock - not shot much at all.  What are you getting with this sale:
1941 husky (husqvarna) M38 - serial: 602571. non threaded barrel. appears all matching (including bolt). Little chip on the stock (see pictures)
1943 (dark stock) Ljungman AG-42b - serial: 20593 - great shape and great shooter. buttplate matches - uncommon!
1943 (light stock) Ljungman AG-42b - serial: 21008 - great shape and great shooter.
if you do not know about Ljungman AG-42b - about 33000 ever made, equipment sold to Egypt and Hakim was born (looks a lot alike). 
3 bayonets with frogs.
2 Ljungman tool rolls - complete
2 swedish leather slings
10 swedish stripper clips (these work GREAT)
90 pieces of once fired winchester brass (6.5x55swede, obviously) in two new plano 50-slot boxes.
one rifle cleaning bottle with a brush.
1 magazine - long story, but I can only include one magazine pictured.  Hakim magazines or MG-13 25rd conversions work just fine with these (currently JB sells some hakim converted mags for under $100 ea), so you will have to either share a mag between two rifles or get some on your own. 

there are plenty of pictures, please ask for any other specific images if needed.
all of these are over 50yrs old = thus C&R eligible.
also listed elsewhere
price: $2100 CASH.
reason for selling:  well, I collect swedish mausers and Ljungman rifles + anything in 6.5x55 for that matter....  with that said, I need to raise $2100 fairly quickly.  If this sells first, well it is sold...however, if my SVD Dragunov sells first, I will take this lot off the chopping block.  So, I do not want to sell, I need to raise cash and these 3 rifles are duplicates anyhow of what I already own...  I do not own junk nor junk you will recieve :).

Few things out of the way:
a) $2100.00 is a firm price.  CASH! - no exceptions
b) not looking for trades
c) I do not do layovers, I am a private party
d) do NOT spam me
e) if you hit 'Contact Seller' button for more pictures/information - please include your telephone number where I can call you to discuss.  I am NOT going to pass it on, I just do not want my time wasted.
    Thank you for understanding.

You can google this model and it come up with several references to it being made by High Standard, but not sure!  It isn't a safe queen, but honest fair to good. Some freckling...maybe light pitting on the barrel, but not too bad. Some bluing thinning all around from cleaning up. Stock has some marks and scratches here and there, but there is also a slight bulge on the butt right behind the grip area about 2"" long? Looks like its old damage or may even have been from tightening the butt stock on or assembling the internal sling? The internal sling is intact, functional and looks solid. Functions on 22 LR 100%...tried three different types with no problems. Didn't have any Longs or shorts to try. My son found this at a sale from a 50+ yr old guy selling off his closet guns. He had this one and a JC Higgins tube Bolt action rifle. He wanted the semi auto over the bolt gun (what kid wouldn't!) Now he wants something else.....sounds like a big 40 yr old kid now! 

Asking $150

I am trying to figure out how to post pics, but I can email plenty of pics. Our asking price isn't terrible though considering the retractable internal sling is ther and functional! 

email direct for pics and offers....we are in NE Ohio near Youngstown in Berlin Center for face to face. I believe this is C&R since last ones were made in 1959. 

So I will need at least a C&R to ship and USPS Money order. If you could include a zip code in your offer...give me your total offer with shipping included so I can determine shipping into to it.

The upper receiver features flattop Lo-Pro Extruded. The Upper Receiver made of 6066-T6 aircraft aluminum. The Lower Receiver ismade of 7075 T6 aircraft aluminum and feature semi-auto trigger group,aluminum trigger guard, and a aluminum magazine release button. The stock is DPMS Pardus Carbine Stock. The handguards are GlacierGuards oval carbine length with aluminum Delta Ring.

Essentially, this is a DPMS sport rifle. The right side of the receiver is streamlined, and is not equipped with a forward assist or a dust cover. All other components of the rifle are the same as the more expensive DPMS Panther packages. If you are a plinker, these components are not necessary anyway, but if you wanted to upgrade, you could pop on a new upper receiver for very few dinero.   

This rifle is a flat top. I have added Yankee Hill back-up iron sights to the rifle. The sights pop up and down easily. The sights are about $75 a piece but I will sell them along with the rifle. 

This rifle was purchased new 2 years ago for $799. Less than 100 rounds have been fired through the rifle. I have aquired another AR platform and have no use for this one. Unfortunately, the market has been flooded with AR rifles, and I can't expect to get back what I paid for it. 

If you want an AR platform for cheap, this is your baby. Comes with case, cleaning kit, and as stated earlier, Yankee Hill back-up iron sights. 

I will provide pictures via e-mail if you would like to see them."

The WASR (nationally regarded as the best entry level AK by Guns&Ammo magazine) was purchased by me factory new a little over a year ago and has had ~2000 put through it during this time. It has been lovingly maintained and correctly stored during all periods of inactivity. 
It has a synthetic TAPCO buttstock with aluminum plate and a traditional style wooden vertical grip. It will come with the case pictured above (Uncle Mike's patrol rifle case), three steel, ribbed 30 round magazines and a quick-detach capable optic mount with two different sets of rails... perfect for mounting a variety of red-dot sights, scopes etc., a broken shell extractor, bayonet and sheath and Century Arms Lifetime (of the weapon) Warranty. 
The WASR parts reserves are slowly drying up, and its painfully obvious in the $100+ spike in MSRP since I purchased this rifle. With cheap bullets, it makes a fun plinker. With high quality commercial loadings (Hornady's V-Max or Z-max ammo) the ballistics of the 7.62x39 perform very similar to a .30-30 Winchester... making this rifle also ideal for hunting or home defensive use. I am really regretting having to sell this, but my loss is your gain. Email or text 274-1554 if interested. Serious inquiries only. $550 or best offer

I have a Springfield standard receiver with installed barrel, rear & front sights, bolt stop, connector lock, op rod, op rod guide, complete flash suppressor and complete gas cylinder. All parts are installed except for the gas cylinder. The GC is not from this rifle and I never installed it so the barrel splines may need to be adjusted for a proper fit. I don't have any barrel gauges here so I can't measure throat or muzzle erosion but it still looks great and shot good before I parted out the rifle. 

The receiver has some finish wear but is still well within spec. I am the second owner. The first said he had put 400-500 rounds through it. I have put around 250 through this receiver/barrel. It has been properly greased since I owned it.

It should make a good receiver for a USGI style build. That was my original plan but I have other projects I need to finish before I dive into yet another M1A/M14 build. If sold, I will type up a bill of sale, 1 copy for me and one for the buyer. If you have any questions just email me or text/call REDACTED."

Haven't shot it much. Tried to trade it off one time before now but withdrew the trade offer before it had a chance to take off because I thought I might be making a mistake. At this point, it's either I trade it for a gun I want and like to shoot, or I start doing drastic things to the gun which will wreck what collectable value is left in it.

Now to start off with, I have an email from FN stating that the serial number this gun used was made in 1946, others have said 44-45, but I believe that FN is dead on with 1946. Having said that, I can attest that the slide portion was an arsenal replacement because as you can see it has an external extractor, which didn't come along until later. As I understand it the A proceeding the serial number on the frame is something that makes it a little more collectable. All the markings match up properly and I am including links to those pictures.

Right now it has (1) split-tongue base mag serial number matching to the gun (these are extremely rare and denote the 1944-195x time frame), two OEM 13rd Browning Mags, two 15rd MecGar Mags, an Israeli 1911 (Like the Blackhawk Serpa) holster modified to fit the 1911, a Hunter leather holster, Original WWII well-worn walnut grips, Craig Spegel style grips (cocobolo).

What I'm interested in: Metric FALs, Cugir made PSLs, Marlin Camp 9, 44-40 Revolvers, 45-70 Lever actions, Eotech XPS2 (or others) etc. Make a trade offer. 

Cash price: $800 + shipping.

The body is a 1967 and the Shelby fiberglass kit is for a 68 but works fine as an update for the 67. The original powerplant was a 289 V8 that is included but has a cracked block. All of the brackets for the accessories are still on the block. The original transmission is in unknown condition. This is a factory air car. Also included is a nice 5.0 V8 and auto transmission from a 1989 foxbody mustang, the engine has around 100,000 miles on it but was running great and burning little oil when removed. Most accessories and the engine computer are with the engine. The Shelby fiberglass kit includes the hood, trunk deck, headlight buckets and lower front valance. There is rust in the roof due to it being a vinyl top and a new rust free top is included if you want to go that route. There is a little rust in the floor pans but can be patched. There are extra sets of fenders, marker light hoods, and trunk lid, plus other extra bits.

According to website, the No4 Mk II (or Mk2) was adopted in 1949, with production at ROF-Fazakerley in July, 1949 until 1955. Fazakerley was the only plant to manufacture the No4 Mk2  .A first year production MK2 to be exact and one of the first few months off the line!  A fairly rare specimen and one to be proud of. The biggest difference in the MK2 and the MK1 is that the trigger of the MK2 is pinned to the receiver instead of the trigger guard. Pinning the the trigger to the receiver made it a more consistent in that the relationship of the trigger to the sear never changed save for wear.  I bought it over 20 years ago when it was still arsenal wrapped in cosmoline to include complete barrel end to end encased in cosmoline.  I was young and stupid (weren’t we all) and made the decision to “Sporterize” the original stock with the intended use for Deer and Elk hunting. The original stock is pictured below with wood in fantastic condition.  I recently purchased for $120 an arsenal NEW – NEVER FINAL FITTED/MOUNTED Dark Hardwood Stock that is simply fantastic.  Normal pressure marks on buttstock, one slight chip near triggerguard.  Note you will need to remove/have removed about 3/8” of wood  from the inside front of the action inletting to get the action to fit as this was never arsenal mounted as I am told…however this means you will have a custom fit stock to the dimensions of your action for impeccable service. I have pictured on:  Finish on Metal is incredible for its age and as compared to other similar rifles being sold on GunBroker.  Magazine, Action, Bolt numbers match. Bore is brilliant bright metal with DEEP rifling. Mounted on the action is a “B-Square” scope mount that uses the existing features of the action to attach…NO DRILLING of the action has taken place. Scope is a BSA (wanted to stay with British Theme) classic series 3-12x50mm with metal screw-in protectors for the glass.  I have the original screw that fits in the side of the action as well as the Original Micrometer iron sights with the cross-pin, pressure springs, etc. required to put back to original.  I will as well include the following accessories:  Blade Bayonet dated 52? That has never been out of the original factory cosmoline/encasing with original arsenal wax paper. Sling Swivel and Barrel Clamp, barrel band, and extra Brass Buttplate that has never been mounted…I cleaned off the original arsenal cosmoline so you could see the perfection of the buttplate.  Guys, lets’ be honest – everything is here to put back to original specification, and you will be very hard pressed to find such a fine example of a #4 Mk II anywhere for under $600. I require a bill of sale to be signed by the purchaser. Please call me with questions REDACTED"

Price above does not apply...Make offer on A5 with LOW serial number starting with “193xxx” which according to the Browning site places date of manufacture/import from Belgium around 1938-40.  Marked “Browning Arms Co. of St. Louis MO” on left side of receiver, with same on Barrel.  Barrel is 2 ¾” chamber, 28” in length, smooth top with bead site, and  .7” internal muzzle opening measurement on dial-calipers for choke (full?). Barrel features the following numbers (F67596, 42  1577) with lots of proof marks from factory inspection. Metal is in outstanding shape for its age, and action/action portion of barrel still has cosmoline in some areas.  Wood is as expected with the traditional forearm repair of crack along interior barrel channel/magazine tube (see photos).  Buttstock has beautiful wood with knobbed drop at handgrip. Small crack at Buttstock base next to buttplate. Slight blemish on left side of buttstock midsection. Traditional buttplate with “FN” markings.  Please contact me with questions, I tried to provide as many images as possible to indicate condition…If you need more photos – just ask.  No warranty expressed or implied, sale is final – no inspection/ return period.  This was passed down to me from my father and I don’t know if/how many times he has fired it…With some of the cosmoline still present – doubtful it would have been much.

It is all original except the trigger pull is about 3 1/2 pounds. It actually still has Gaston's ""weekend"" sights on it (look it up, it's a good story) and they function very well. At 7 yards you are knocking out a good sized hole. I am not the original owner so I do not know round count but if you look at the picture of the barrel you can see it is not high.

I am looking for a Glock 17 of equal value and condition. Gen 1 or 2 only. If it is a Gen 2 I would prefer pre-ban years (pre-1994). If you have pre-ban, numbers on the sides magazines, an even swap of pre-ban mags could be arranged up to a total of 2. If not I have newer mags that we can swap evenly.

FEG AK47 SA2000M - Made in Hungary. This rifle takes the 10 round hungarian steel mags. The receiver can be modified to accept 30 round mags by simply milling out the mag well to accept 30 round mags but I have neither the time nor the inclination to do this as I have other projects I am building. If you have questions about this, please Google it prior to emailing me. These are somewhat rare from what I have read and are no longer imported. I have around 250 rounds through the rifle. 

I'm asking $500.00 obo. If you have a trade in mind, and want to email me, I will look at what you have. please no stupid trades, like boats or car parts. Interested in Guns, no shotguns or anything smaller than a .380 - I favor 9mm semi automatic pistols and .40's. 

comes with five 10 round hungarian magazines

Some specs on the rifle:

A. Choate Polymer dragunov sniper style stock with recoil pad and length of pull spacer
B. 18.5"" barrel length
C. Overall length is 38""
D. Typical AK front and rear sights
E. Original pinned AMD muzzle-brake
F. Tri Rail for accessories, You can still use the iron sights through this rail. perfect for flashlight, red dot, etc. 

The fit and finish of this rifle is awesome, a few small dings in the finish on the barrel, that were there when i purchased this rifle many years ago.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

 The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design. 


Trijicon ACOG TA31F-G with Bobro single quick throw lever mount and original. Only 60 rounds shot when using this optic! Comes with everything it did new including scope cover, pen brush , papers, case, etc..etc..

This amazing shotgun was a limited run for the 2005 Shot Show. They are pretty difficult to find, especially at a fair price. It comes from the factory duracoated in OD green. The magazine tube capacity is 7+1 which is also a factory modification. This shotgun also has the pistol grip. There are a few light knicks and dings but nothing serious. The OD is actual OD green. I know it is difficult to see in the photos, but I assure you, it is OD green. This model also has a bayonet lug.

This gun is used but in good shape. There are minor signs of wear on the trigger and receiver screw heads.  There is also a very minor scratch on the butt stock that is hardly noticable.  Over-all the barrels, receiver, and wood are in really good condition.  Weatherby told me that this gun was manufactured in either '85 or '86.  It weighs about 7pds.  This gun has screw-in chokes.  I have Imp, Sk, Full, and Mod sizes with the choke tube tool.  This is a beautiful gun.  It comes with a soft case.  I'm located in downtown indianapolis.

I would prefer the Smith & Wesson over the Interarms model as I have a large collection of Smiths. Yes I know the reputation Smith have, but it's what I prefer. :)
 This pistol includes the following:
 • Ruger LCP .380 Auto Pistol (Blued)

 Additional information about the Ruger LCP 380: http://www.ruger.com/products/lcp/index.html 
Weighing just 9.4 oz (266.5 g) this is Ruger's first entry into the field of tiny, ultra-light defensive pistols.[4] LCP stands for ""Lightweight Compact Pistol"" and was designed in direct response to customer requests for a compact firearm for use by police as a back-up, and as a defensive handgun for civilian concealed carry needs.[5]
 The pistol has a glass-filled nylon frame, a two-finger grip, and a through-hardened blued steel slide. It is similar in appearance to the Kel-Tec P-3AT which weighs 8.3 oz. and uses a similar tension spring for the lightweight hammer, identical locked breech mechanism, and similar takedown method. The main differences are the Glock style extractor and the incorporation of an external slide stop. It is possible to tell if there is a round chambered by looking at the ""view hole"" next to the extractor
 Additional information about the Laserlyte laser: http://www.laserlyte.com/products/ck-amf
 LaserLyte answers the growing demand for lasers specific to the increasingly popular conceal carry market with the new Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser (CK-AMF). At half the cost of a leading competitor, the CK-AMF fits on the side of the Ruger LCP and the Kel-Tec .380 and .32. Easy to mount on the gun by simply pushing out and replacing the stock pins with the new screws (included). Then push the ergonomic activation button with the index finger and the laser is on target. The CK-AMF design works also as a finger guide that allows for safe trigger control without blocking the laser beam. The programmable laser features a pulse or constant on mode and also has an auto-off function to prevent an unwanted battery drain. The side mounted laser allows the pistol to fit in virtually any nylon pocket holster. The new LaserLyte Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser is compact and light, and foremost – deadly.

This rifle was partially built by LRB. The receiver, bolt, barrel and op rod guide were installed by them. The rest was assembled by me. This has been a fantastic weapon so far. I got my barreled receiver in from LRB at my local FFL in September 2011 and assembled it a few days later. Since then I have put around 200 rounds through it. Every single round has been 168gr FGMM, no reloads or junk ammo.

It has a Vortex PST 4-16x50mm FFP scope mounted in Burris Tactical rings. The scope is available. It is the MOA/MOA model.

I'm not in a huge hurry to get rid of this rifle but I am asking $3500 OBO with the Vortex scope.

I bought this for my wife, but she doesn't like the fact that it does not have a safety, and of course, you can't return a gun.  So, I am putting the gun up for sale for 95 dollars less than you would pay for it from the store, or best offer.  I have fired twenty rounds through it total, and it comes with the case, and all the original paperwork and accessories.  

It's a great gun, but as I stated, it does not have a safety because that's how it was designed.  Also, so you are not caught off guard, the slide lock is intended to lock the slide back, but not to release it forwards--can be done, but not as easy as most European designs; this model follows the American design where you release it by pulling it back slightly by hand.

I have this AR10 carbine. It’s a 16” Rainer Arms UltraMatch Barrel:
•	Stainless Steel Match Grade Shilen Blank
•	Length: 16?
•	Twist: 1:10
•	Gas Block Seat: .750 Diameter
•	Thread Pitch: 5/8×24
•	Weight: 2 lbs 7 oz
•	.308 Rainier Match Chamber
•	Mid Gas System
•	6 Groove
•	M4 Feed Ramps
•	Proprietary Contour
•	Bead Blasted Finish
I would describe the weight as medium weight. It’s a great shooting barrel that loves 165gn Hornandy loads. The rail system is a Daniels Defense Lite 9.0. The buffer has been changed out with a XH from Slash’s Heavy Buffers and an AR15 tube so it will use any MilSpec AR15 stock. The included stock is an VLTOR Emod. The heavier buffer helps soften felt recoil. The carbine weighs 9.2 lbs.

I designed this gun to make easy 500 yd shots while remaining light enough to hump around. It’s taken three deer over the last 2 seasons. The furthest shot was 160yds. With the factory Hornandy 165 grain loads, it will easily maintain 1”.

Also included are 10x Generation II 20-round magazines, a 10 round magazine, and a 5 round magazine."

I have a benelli 12g pump action Nova that i would like to sell or trade out. I'm not in a dire need to get rid of i just have too many shotguns. It does come in the advantage timber cammo print. shoots 3.5in mag shells recoil pad and white bead all of which you can see in the pics. standard length barrel. Its a great shotgun that hasn't seen much use except a few turkey seasons. I know what its worth as well but i'm fair. so if you try to trade me a single shot H&R prolly not gonna be a deal..I had it listed in the past but if i didnt respond I was out of town.

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W, the SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm."
