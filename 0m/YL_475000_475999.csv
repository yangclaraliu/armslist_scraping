These two pistols are in great mechanical shape and function well. The lock up is tight and there is little to no play. From what I was told about them they shot mostly .38 special and the blued one has some wear and tear on the finish.

The blued pistol has some handling marks all over it as well as the bluing is worn on parts of the cylinder and barrel. The rear sight appears to have seen the ground [it looks like it was dropped on the rear sight blade] and the grips have some scratches and wear. The mechanicals on the pistol are great and when I put about 18 rds through it, it worked great and was very accurate. this pistol also has the target grips.

The second pistol has been refinished with a teflon/moly coating in OD Green and black accents. It looks in great condition and does show some wear on the grips. It has the target grips and shoots great.

Looking to sell these off in either a pair for $975
Or I can split them; the blued pistol for $425 and the OD Green pistol for $575

This one does include the famous ""gill"" slide serrations. Essentially its a precursor to the gen4, but with gen 3 internals in addition to the gen 3 sized grip with aggressive texture.  I bought it expecting to transition to the Glock family and wanted the texture without the Gen 4 (has't been vetted long enough for me to buy into it) however I do not foresee myself transitioning to it as my serious use/training/nightstand firearms. As Such I figured would through my hat in the ring and see if anyone out there is interested in a Glock variant that is getting a little harder to find these days. 

Details:
-Glock 17 RTF2 with just under 100 WWB rounds through it, includes 2 factory mags, box, lock, bore brush and paperwork (everything it came with)
-PEW prefix serial number (11-29-2010 test fire date)
-Not looking to travel to far from the Springs, but feel free to contact me we may be able to work something out.
-Price is rather solid as it is like new and I am in no need to move it, however interesting trades are welcome and all trades will be considered 

Thank you for taking the time to look, feel free to ask any questions about the firearm, or posit any offers. I will also try to accommodate an photo requests. If interested I will be using a bill of sale with legitimate drivers licence required at the time of sale (to protect you and me, also to act as a receipt), and obviously one should be 21+ with no legal history or reasoning that would prohibit them the legal ownership, possession, and use of firearms. Price is pretty firm, though all reasonable offers and trades will be considered.

I've had it 2 years and never shot it. Everything is original Winchester EXCEPT Handguard, it is Inland. No dents, scratches that are not shown in pics. The 2 vetical marks on the forearm are defects in the wood not dents or scratches. No refinishing on any part of the gun that I or my gun dealer can see. It is NOT an import. The stock is walnut with dull finish. Has cartouche on stock as well as all the markings on the gun in my pictures. The only one that is confusing is a ""U"" on the pistol grip. The bolt is blued the receiver is green and the barrel is black. The barrel has the original machining marks the length of the barrel which tells me it has not been reblued. The receiver still has pronounced machine maks that would have been worn off if used very much. The only 2 defects that I know of is a small patch of rust on the butt plate and the upper snap on the sling doesn't want to stay snapped. Very, very nice collector gun that I must sell.

Very good for practicing for steel challenge, or just having a nice reusable target. Each one has a metal base. The rebar will not be effected by pistol rounds (as I have discovered; I'm not as good of a shot as I'd like to think).

The CF-X delivers 1000 fps velocity with just one cock. Features a rifled steel barrel with a grooved receiver for mounting a scope, fiber optic sight, a rugged synthetic stock and two-stage trigger. Very accurate and powerful. When the rifle is cocked, the rotary breech allows you to place a pellet directly into the barrel. The barrel stays at a fixed position when cocking with the cocking lever.. The Gamo CF-X comes with Truglo Fiber Optic sights, a black, all-weather stock with a ventilated butt pad, twin-cheek pads, and a non-slip checkering.

This is the Carbon 15 M4 model that is both light and durable. Bushmaster claims that the carbon upper and lower receivers are 40% stronger and lighter than aluminum. I am the second owner and have put a hundred rounds through it of various manufacturers and grains. It comes with a carbine stock endplate sling mount installed. It also has a Viking Tactical quick adjustment sling and quad rail weapon light mount. It has a forward grip with battery compartments, flashlight, ladder rail covers and is currently set up with a Tasco 30mm tube style red dot sight. The sight is inexpensive but works really well. It is similar in function to a low mount Aimpoint sight in that it allows you to cowitness with the iron sights and still look over the fixed rear sight just to use the red dot. The front sight post is illuminated as well, but I don't know what brand. The barrel is 1/9 twist and it shoots both 5.56 and .223. If you have any questions, email."

This gun is in 99% condition, I say 99% as it is used but not much!!! No rust, scratches, or any other issues. It is flawless.

When I say highly collectable, first off it was made in 1975, this was the first year Ruger made this gun in Stainless Steel, also this is a PRE-WARNING revolver. In 1977 Ruger started put warning stamps on the barrel stating to read owners manuel etc... before using the gun. My gun has no warning, lastly it is the snub nose version made with a 2 3/4"" barrel, these are alot harder to come by as the production numbers on these length barrels were very limited. It has adjustable sights as well. Try and find a 2 3/4"" Pre warning in this condition, you wont, I searched two years before I found this one and it was a fluke, they are just not out there for sale very often??? I just checked Armslist and there isnt any 2 3/4"" barrel Security Sixes even listed. They are really hard to find.

I have a nice pair of Hogue Grips on the gun and I also have the original wooden grips, the original grips are mint condition. This gun has been fired very little and lockup is super tight and the trigger in single action is crisp, so crisp and light it is amazing. One of the best pistols I have ever owned and fired. Selling it to fund another project!

Lastly this gun comes with a handmade leather holster, this holster was special made for this gun and the two combine for a excellent carry piece.
This gun also comes with two Dade speed loaders and some ammo."

The gun does come with 2 mags.  I've had the gun for about 3 years and it only has a malfunction every once in a great while if ever.  I cant say i haven't had any FTE/FTFs but its so rare that its not an issue but its a .22 so you kinda have to expect it.  I know the gun works very good with CCI mini mags, Federal bulk pack (550 red box), and Remington golden bullet.  I've always used the federal ammo.  I can also say the gun HATES Winchester ammo.  It doesn't like to chamber a round because it doesn't blow the slide back far enough.  Im not looking to sell, just to trade for whats mentioned above.  I'm not in a hurry and if it doesn't go then thats fine too.  Just thought I would try this out and see if anything happens.  Also if interested I am gonna want to test out the kit while you can test my mosquito.  Range will be no charge."

Re: NOVESKE STAINLESS STEEL BARRELS
Our stainless barrels are made to fill a precision role while retaining flawless function. Retaining accuracy and reliability is a complicated balance in that the chamber needs to be slightly modified from the NATO to improve bullet hook-up in the throat, while keeping to functional properties of the NATO body dimensions.The result is our proprietary Noveske chambering. The steel used is a type of 416r and hardened to about 30 HRC prior to any machining. These barrels are button rifled with our proprietary 7 PT button. This rifling profile differs from that in the chrome lined barrel line in that the lands have a slightly more trapezoidal shape. This design and the type of stainless used helps the lead edge of the rifling from eroding as fast as it might with conventional rifling, and the barrels tend to outlast others. For use in any precision application, we recommend the stainless barrel for its edge in accuracy and excellent reliability."
