Here's a 22 mag cylinder, probably from a F.I.E. Bring your 22 single action over, and see if it fits. If it does, you can have it for $20.

After meeting with a fellow OSA guy to try out the cylinder in his 22 (too small) it dawned on me that I should get some dimensions. Here they are;

OAL= 1.615""
OD = 1.406""
Cyl Length, less the gear and spacer on the exit side= 1.444"" 
gear height= .090
spacer height= .080""
gear OD= .565""
center hole diameter= .220""
exit side spacer ID= .465""
lock width= .146""
most importantly!!! Distance center to cener, axle hole to chamber= .465"" 

But Dave! How do I get the center to center accurately??? Measure the axle hole bore, and exit side chamber bore. Add them together, divide by two. We'll call the product of this equation ""A"". Next measure outer edge of axle hole to outer edge cylinder hole. Let's call that ""B"". Subtract your first product (A) from second product (B). That is the center to center. Oh Crap! Algebra!!!! 

I can make any adjustments (especially making it smaller) short of moving the chamber holes. Bear in mind these are rough measurements, they are accurate + or - .002""."

As you can see it is a custom gun that was created for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. I do not know how many were made, but it wasnt very many. It says LVMPD-45 on one side. Also, by the rear sights it has one side the Badge and on the other the Patch of the department. 

I had planned on using this gun for duty use... ended up going another route. don't really shoot it, It has easily under 300 rds through it and that is a high estimate. 

It also has trijicon night sights, but the front one is missing. I don't know how this happened, but apparently while getting installed it wasnt set right, and while shooting it must have come out somehow. Very easy to put a new one in there though. 

Its a nice gun, and would make for a good collector gun, or just another sidearm to carry if you prefer.

Light scratches on the receiver, nothing major.
Shoots good, doesn't jam, accurate and reliable.
Only 150 rounds through since I bought it brand new, comes with everything pictured plus 550 rounds of Silver Bear non corrosive ammo.

I'm NOT interested in cash, bolt actions, single shots, shotguns etc.

I'm only looking to trade for a heavy caliber semi automatic rifle so I can go hog and coyote hunting, this AK just lacks the range and power I really need to make those long shots, and I just don't have the cash for another rifle, and the ones I want are still going to be above my budget even if I sell this rifle for what I can get, so I'm looking for someone that will trade straight across for me.

Thanks for reading."

This is a great gun, I have fired approximately 1500 rounds through it with no failures.  It is a very accurate gun and a joy to shoot.  The p250 is a modular handgun which allows you to transfer the fire control mechanism between different grip modules.  This allows you to have either a full size duty gun, a smaller compact gun or a subcompact gun all in one.  I have used this as a ccw firearm as well as a target shooting range gun.  The gun conceals well, I have carried it in the summer under just a t-shirt or polo shirt as well as during the winter under heavier outerwear.  The gun has factory night sights which are still very bright, the gun is only two years old.  I also have four magazines for the gun which I will include, they are 2-16 round magazines and 2-15 round magazines.  There is minor holster wear on the slide release, otherwise the gun is in wonderful condition and has been meticulously maintained.  I also have a kholster brand holster for the gun that I will include for an additional $25.  This is a tuckable iwb holster similar to a crossbreed holster.

Never opened. Never used. Not refurbished. Amazingly compact and simple to use, this Bushnell Scout 1000 rangefinder features Bushnell's exclusive Angle Range Compensation (ARC) technology, which accounts for terrain angle to give you an accurate ""shoots-like"" distance--all with the tap of a button. A Bow mode provides true horizontal distance from 5 to 99 yards, while the Rifle mode provides bullet-drop/holdover data in inches from 100 to 800 yards. This weather-resistant rangefinder features a black body, built-in inclinometer, fully multi-coated optics, and built-in tripod mount.

This rangefinder is the best, you won't know how you lived without for so long!

Targeting Modes

* Bow: Provides true horizontal distance from 5 to 99 yards based on angle.
* Rifle Mode: Select the ballistic group of your firearm (guidelines supplied). When you range your target, an inclinometer displays the angle and provides bullet-drop/holdover in inches (up to 99"") from 100 to 600 yards.
* SCAN: Allows you to pan across the landscape while viewing a continuously updated LCD display of the distances between you and the targets you scan.
* BullsEye: Geared for close-range use, this mode acquires the distances of small targets and game without inadvertently measuring background target distances. When more than one object is acquired, the closer of the two objects is shown on the LCD display.
* Brush: Ignores the foreground, such as brush, boulders and tree branches, and provides distances on the LCD display to background objects only.

The Beretta Px4 Storm Sub-Compact pistol is the most advanced sub-compact sidearm of its kind. Built around Beretta’s latest Px4 modular technology, the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower. Available in two calibers (9mm and .40 S&W), the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact uses a very reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more compact and lighter weight system. A stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion resistant, perfectly suited for concealment close to active, perspiring bodies. The pistol adapts to different hand sizes easily with interchangeable backstraps (included). An ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. A reversible magazine release button can be mounted on either side and can quickly be replaced by a smaller and larger size button (optional). An interchangeable slide catch can also be replaced with an optional extended profile configuration. A standard Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD-1913) allows for an array of aftermarket accessories.

Why fool around buying all these parts yourself and then hoping they will fit right on your rifle? I have installed, adjusted, padded and tightened everything and this gun has fired over 1000 rounds at the range with barely a jam (only when I get a dud bullet). Can hit a plastic bottle at 100 yards conesecutively for almost a whole clip. This has a metal trigger assembly and the receiver and barrel are in excellant shape with only several very unnoticable scratches.
