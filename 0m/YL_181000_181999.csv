I just want a gun like an XD, Glock, Judge which are typically $450 guns.

This is my wifes and my old jewelry that we dug out of out closet. It is all perfect chains, bracelets, spoons, earrings, rings, keychains, and a silver cup. This came from all over the world in our travels to mexico, italy, the USA, and my wife is from India so there is some of that also. You can probably sell this as jewelry for more than the silver value because it is all perfect, but I am trading it for less than weight value. If you want to do cash that is fine, but a gun trade is more interesting."

What quickly and dramatically sets the Ruger LCR apart from and ahead of the many old 5-shot, double action .38 Specials is the wondrous double-action trigger pull. While the trigger gauge shows it as about a nine pound trigger, Ruger has refined the trigger geometry and spring rates so it feels much lighter. The LCR has a smooth and consistent trigger pull that makes it relatively easy to cycle the cylinder and fire this revolver while maintaining a constant sight picture. As that is the whole idea with a personal defense pistol, Ruger can't be commended too highly for pulling this one off. It has an out-of-the box feel as if it had been tuned by the likes of Jack Weigand. The LCR is that smooth.

The primary ammo used was the Stars & Stripes Custom Ammo 125 grain Speer Gold Dot combat rounds. Shooting through the CED M2 chrono screens, the 5 foot velocity ranged from 767 – 796 fps, which is formidable, especially taking into consideration the diminutive 1-1/8 inch LCR barrel. After shooting fifty rounds of this ammo through the Ruger LCR, I can't call this revolver the ideal plinker by any means, but calling the recoil quite manageable is a fair assessment. It was surprisingly manageable considering the light weight of this handgun. For comparison, let me mention one of my least favorite type of handguns, the common .380 blowback semi-auto. Many of them are just nasty little palm-slappers, with crummy trigger pulls and an unfortunate propensity to stovepipe. Often you'll find them with merciless hard plastic crucifix type grips and slides that find new ways to slice the top of your hand, as well.

It's not true of all .380s, to be sure, but palm-slapping, hand-slicing stove-piping little monsters with snag-o-matic external hammers are something I genuinely revile. It is the exact opposite of what I'd want to rely on in a high-stress, self-defense situation. In fact, the only .380 that I personally consider fun to shoot for extended periods is a Makarov IJ-70 and even the IJ-70 wears a set of of Pearce grips.

The .380 genre of pistol, even with good ammo like Speer Gold Dot, suffers in penetration compared to a .38 Special revolver. You need only compare the sectional densities of a 90-95 grain .380 bullet to a 125-158 grain .38 Special bullet to see why.

The benefits of a wheelgun for personal defense are straightforward and well known. Stovepiping and failures to feed are not a possible and cycling past a dead round requires only a second pull of the trigger. Anything that is tethered to the function of the ammo to work is going to be less reliable than an action that is not.

Setting up at 10 yards, I emptied the LCR as fast as I could into a Shoot-N-C target. The results were more than adequate to neutralize most intimate threats, with actual use likely to be at less than half that distance. Published studies vary a bit, but most self-defense applications are measured in feet, not yards. A friend of mine likes to put it this way, “If I was purposely going to a gunfight, I'd use something else.” So would I, as a matter of fact. However, that isn't the point. We aren't going to gunfights, we simply want the ability to defend ourselves and our families should we be unexpectedly forced to do so. In this regard, the Ruger LCR shines. It is easily carried, swift to deploy, manageable in recoil allowing for confident initial shot and follow-up shot placement, is clearly a well-built, and fundamentally reliable protection piece.

For in the home only defense, certainly a 12 gauge pump like the current Ithaca Model 37 Home Defense gun with a 20 inch barrel and a moderate load of #1 buck could be considered a more forgiving, effective approach. When concealability and portability are paramount, the only form of self-defense that matters is the one you have access to at that precise moment.

The LCR is available with laser grips, but the approach I prefer has just been announced by XS Sight Systems for 2010, an improved standard dot Tritium front sight for the Ruger Part Number: RP-0008N-4. I'll get one installed as soon as I can.

The Ruger LCR is a rare revolver, one that is optimized for a specific application, and fulfills the fast handling, ease of use, speed of use, outstanding build quality with a mass produced, double-action trigger pull that has never before been equaled in this personal self-defense platform. It is a home-run for Ruger and a winner in this category of this revolver with no question in my mind. Ruger has extended and improved the breed with their little LCR .38 Special +P."

This weapon is near to mint.  It has been shot, but it was perfectly maintained and is ready to become a part of the discriminating buyer’s collection.  This is a particularly fine weapon.  It’s the type of quality weapon that Thomas Crown would have and enjoy as part of his good life.  It’s one that the older Bond would appreciate and the newest Bond would kill for.  Oops.  Bad pun there.

This weapon is from my personal collection so there is no paperwork or sales tax.  It is an attempt to “thin out” what I own.  And perhaps to raise a little money for to spend.  Kind offers entertained and reasonable offers may be accepted.  

But, you must have a valid Arizona ID and be legally able and eligible to purchase one.  It is not suitable for mailing because of the extra fees involved, and because I want to sell only face to face and only here in Northwest Tucson or within some reasonable driving distance.

Cash (no checks, money orders, or stamps)  is preferred, but interesting trades will be considered. I am seeking a short barreled 22 similar to the S&W model 36.  And a Python or Diamondback.  And a Leupold with Target Turrets.  And who knows what else.  Please no leather, whips, chains, or teenage children.  Already have enough of those.  

Not incidentally, this weapon will never be listed on Ebay.  Or Craigslist.  Or be available at any of the Gun Shows because I don’t like the heat and dust and humility at the Pima County Fairgrounds."

Items I've added consist of a full length XS Sight Systems picatinny rail for better scope mounting (factory forward rail comes with it) & a Burris Fullfield II 3-9x40 scope with ballistic plex reticle. Scope also comes with the Butler Creek flip-up covers. 

I tell ya this is one mean looking rifle. Gunsite & Ruger got this one right. Only reason I'm selling is I received a good deal on a new Remington 700 Police LTR in .308 so wife says I have to get this one out the door.  I have about $1,200 in rifle & accessories so you won't be doing too bad to get this one while you can.

Up for sale here are two items:

First is a set of BARELY USED 7” AR Carbine handguards.  They came off a Smith and Wesson M&P 15P carbine (piston-driven).  The upper half of the handguard does not have a heat shield, that’s how it came off the weapon.  The upper half also has a larger cutout to accommodate the S&W piston, but can quite easily accommodate a conventional gas tube.  The lower handguard DOES have the heatshield.  The heatshield may have a tool mark or two, I initially attached a MagPul polymer rail section and an AFG2, but nothing that would impair its use or operation.  Obviously, I do not have an original packaging for them, but they will be packed carefully and securely for shipment.

This sale also includes a BARELY USED MIL-SPEC collapsible stock for M4/AR-15.  This came with the same Smith and Wesson M&P 15P carbine (piston-driven).  I swapped it out for a MIL-SPEC MagPul MOE, and haven’t used it since, but I’m sure someone out there can make use of this one.  Freebie:  GG &G rear Sling Thing (retails about $32)

BE AWARE:  There IS a difference between MIL-SPEC and COMMERCIAL-sized stocks.  If the receiver extension tube on your weapon is Commercial-sized, this stock will NOT fit your weapon, PERIOD.  MIL-SPEC tubes are generally between 1.145” and 1.150” diameter, whereas Commercial-Spec tubes are usually between 1.160” and 1.175” diameter.

PAYMENT:  I accept cash for FTF transactions.  If I have to ship, the only PayPal payments from CONFIRMED BUYERS with CONFIRMED ADDRESSES and VERIFIED ACCOUNTS at this time.

SHIPPING:  I ship all my items through USPS Priority Mail with Tracking and Delivery Confirmation.  I will waive shipping fees for any of my sales with a price above $75, or if you buy multiple items and the total price is above $75.If you request local pickup I will also waive shipping.  If the price is below $75, I will require a flat rate shipping fee of $10.00 per item.

MAGPUL BUIS (MBUS):

Up for sale here is a front & back pair of MagPul polymer MBUS GEN 1 and another GEN 2 front sight.  Thes GEN1s came with my Smith and Wesson M&P15P out of the box, but I never fired the weapon with them installed.  I was leery of the GEN1 front sight, but the dealer would not swap, so I bought a GEN2 and never bought from him again.  I do not have an “original packaging” for them, but I will pack and ship them as I would want them packed and shipped, if I was the buyer.

As stated, I never fired the weapon with the MagPul MBUS, but judging from the rest of their product line, I don’t see why their sights would be anything less than a great “bang for your buck,” pun COMPLETELY INTENDED.
No scratches or damages to either MBUS, and I will include the MagPul polymer front sight adjustment tool at no charge (I have a metallic one on my keychain, so why do I need another one?).

***NOTE***:  MagPul Industries does not recommend that the front MBUS be used on weapons with railed gas blocks (like the M&P15P, so why did you sell it to me that way???).  

From their website:

“Cannot be mounted to a railed gas block due to excess heat issues. Front MBUS must be mounted to a railed fore end on the same plane as the receiver rail. Because of this the sight is not compatible with the MOE Hand Guard.”

Up for sale here is a pair of BARELY USED Troy Industries Micro BattleSight BUIS.  I initially bought these to use with my Smith and Wesson M&P15, but they turned out to be too low for it.  Very precise, but a bit too low…  

Speaking of low, these retail at around $199 before tax and shipping...  Buy them from me and you pay neither

Since I believe in truth in advertising...

1)  This is from my email correspondence with one of Troy’s representatives:  
“Normally for standard AR-15 rifles like the Smith and Wesson M&P we do not recommend using the Micro BattleSights as they are too low to function. We manufacture the Micro BattleSights for alternate rifle platforms and M4 platforms that feature receiver rails that are higher than the conventional AR-15. For the standard rifle I would recommend using the standard height BattleSights. These sights are standard AR-15 height and will work with carry handles and FSB’s.”

2)  They came as a set, but I no longer have the original blister package for them.  They will be packed and shipped as I would want them to be if I was the buyer…

3)  See the third picture.  The rear sight has a slight scratch on the inside of the adjustment slot, and the front sight has a small scratch near the front right of the front sight post well.

4)  I will also include a front sight post adjustment tool with the set, at no extra charge (I have a few that I don’t need, so why not?)

Spain was ostensibly neutral in World War II, but favored the Axis powers. In 1941, Astra sold  pistols to the German military   . By 1943 the Model 600, chambered for the 9mm Parabellum, was in production, and the first 10,450 guns were delivered between May and July of 1944.  Due to the Allied forces invasion of Southern France, the second order was never delivered, and the remaining production of the Model 600 was ultimately sold commercially. A total of 59,400 Model 600s were produced."

I definitely loved this rifle but have to sell it to pay for grad school.  It's reliable, very accurate, and fun to shoot.  Thanks to the light weight, low recoil, and 6-position collapsing stock, most any shooter can handle it easily.  My girlfriend loves it almost as much as I do.  It shoots both .223 and 5.56 ammunition."

I got this in a trade from a buddy.  It's an awesome AK.  Probably the best variant of AK I've ever had.  It is bar none the smoothest shooter I've experienced and has an INSANELY nice trigger pull.  My friend said that it runs like a ""raped ape.""  Now, I've never seen an ape run, let alone one that's just been raped but I assume that means it fires well.  I have seen my mom's sewing machine run and this rivals that in smoothness and pure awesomeness.  I put about 60 rounds through this the other day and prior to that it looked like it hadn't been shot much but I don't have an approximate or truthful round count.  






This rifle is chambered in 5.56x45 (.223 Remington).  It is NOT chambered in 5.45x39, 7.62x51, 8mm KURZ, 9mm Luger or 7.62x39.  It eats WOLF .223 (5.56) like it's candy.  It should, right, I mean, it is an AK.  It also has a super sexy AK-74 style muzzle break/flash suppressor.  

It was made in China.  By Chinese.  In a Chinese factory named NORINCO.  They haven't been imported in YEARS and probably won't ever be again unless those silly import bans get lifted.  Considering, though, our immediate future I don't think that's gonna happen.

Magazines.  It comes with 4 Chinese made steel 30 round magazines.  They would run ~$40-$50 each *IF* you could find them.  I know that you're thinking ""Hey, Todd, wtf?  How am I going to get mags for this in the future?""  Well, I'll tell you.  Buy the Bulgarian Circle 10 mags from K-Var.  Some will fit straight away, some require just a bit of filing on the lips and rear catch area to slim down a bit.  You gotta put those things on a diet.  Once you get them filed down they work great.  

The Sling.  It's a real AK sling.  It's made in Bulgaria.  By Bulgarians, I think.  I'm not sure if they have the same problem of illegal immigration that we do but I'd assume it's made by Bulgarians.  Maybe Gypsies, though, or Turks.  Whatever, it's a good sling.  

The stock has a few little dings and scratches here and there but they all look like they've come from banging around in the safe more than anything else.  

Must meet in the Kent/Auburn/Covington area.  I really don't want to travel very far. 

Here's the deal on the new package.  

An offer of $875 will get the gun, mags, sweet chinese made rifle case, and taiwanese made CRKT M60 SOTFB knife.
An offer of $850 will get the gun, mags, and sweet chinese made rifle case.

I have too many .22s and just simply isn't practical to have so many guns that I don't really shoot that much.

I have a Remington 597 in .22LR that has been sprayed with a camo pattern. It shoots dead on I have the sights adjusted for elevation and windage dead on for my eyes. I love the sights on this rifle because you can adjust them with a screw driver and allen wrench for elevation and windage. It has a nice target crown and shoots great. It comes with two ten round magazines but the springs in one of the magazines is getting a little weak and it doesn't feed right sometimes when you put all 10 rounds in it but the other magazine functions fine. I always clean it after I shoot it by taking it apart and cleaning it from the chamber to the bore like you are supposed to. I just cleaned and lubed it so it will come ready to shoot. It was well cared for and has served me well dispatching groundhogs around the farm. It would make a boy a nice rifle.

You can put a scope on this rifle with either a weaver scope base or it also has dove tails cut in the receiver. If you want to go the weaver base route you will need a weaver 414M scope base which cost about ten bucks. It mounts to the receiver with three allen screws which are already drilled and tapped in the receiver."

NEW Bushmaster ACR Model #: ACRSS16M-C
With ability to rapidly change calibers, barrel lengths and stock configurations, the new Bushmaster ACR adapts to varied conditions like no rifle that has come before it. In minutes, without tools, it will go from 5.56mm to 6.8mm to 6.5mm by swapping the bolt head, barrel and magazine. With an exchange of stocks, barrels and accessories, it transforms from a close-quarters weapon to a designated marksman platform. Simply put, the Bushmaster ACR is the highest evolution of modular rifle utility. This rifle is built specifically for law enforcement and tactical applications - with Bushmaster's unrivaled standards for durability and precision. They've nearly doubled barrel life and reduced maintenance with the addition of an innovative protective coating. This is also featured on action components for dramatically reduced wear and enhanced operation. For the ultimate blend of strength and reduced weight, they used rugged, high density composite for the hand guard, lower receiver and stock. The heart of the ACR is their gas piston operating system. It's torture tested and proven reliable in the most brutal conditions on the planet. From the magazine release and fire selector to the non reciprocating charging handle, ambidextrous controls optimize user effectiveness. Add Bushmaster's hallmark commitment to quality down to the slightest ingredient, and you have a platform that's a natural fit for any operator and every mission.

Heres a review
What quickly and dramatically sets the Ruger LCR apart from and ahead of the many old 5-shot, double action .38 Specials is the wondrous double-action trigger pull. While the trigger gauge shows it as about a nine pound trigger, Ruger has refined the trigger geometry and spring rates so it feels much lighter. The LCR has a smooth and consistent trigger pull that makes it relatively easy to cycle the cylinder and fire this revolver while maintaining a constant sight picture. As that is the whole idea with a personal defense pistol, Ruger can't be commended too highly for pulling this one off. It has an out-of-the box feel as if it had been tuned by the likes of Jack Weigand. The LCR is that smooth.

The primary ammo used was the Stars & Stripes Custom Ammo 125 grain Speer Gold Dot combat rounds. Shooting through the CED M2 chrono screens, the 5 foot velocity ranged from 767 – 796 fps, which is formidable, especially taking into consideration the diminutive 1-1/8 inch LCR barrel. After shooting fifty rounds of this ammo through the Ruger LCR, I can't call this revolver the ideal plinker by any means, but calling the recoil quite manageable is a fair assessment. It was surprisingly manageable considering the light weight of this handgun. For comparison, let me mention one of my least favorite type of handguns, the common .380 blowback semi-auto. Many of them are just nasty little palm-slappers, with crummy trigger pulls and an unfortunate propensity to stovepipe. Often you'll find them with merciless hard plastic crucifix type grips and slides that find new ways to slice the top of your hand, as well.

It's not true of all .380s, to be sure, but palm-slapping, hand-slicing stove-piping little monsters with snag-o-matic external hammers are something I genuinely revile. It is the exact opposite of what I'd want to rely on in a high-stress, self-defense situation. In fact, the only .380 that I personally consider fun to shoot for extended periods is a Makarov IJ-70 and even the IJ-70 wears a set of of Pearce grips.

The .380 genre of pistol, even with good ammo like Speer Gold Dot, suffers in penetration compared to a .38 Special revolver. You need only compare the sectional densities of a 90-95 grain .380 bullet to a 125-158 grain .38 Special bullet to see why.

The benefits of a wheelgun for personal defense are straightforward and well known. Stovepiping and failures to feed are not a possible and cycling past a dead round requires only a second pull of the trigger. Anything that is tethered to the function of the ammo to work is going to be less reliable than an action that is not.

Setting up at 10 yards, I emptied the LCR as fast as I could into a Shoot-N-C target. The results were more than adequate to neutralize most intimate threats, with actual use likely to be at less than half that distance. Published studies vary a bit, but most self-defense applications are measured in feet, not yards. A friend of mine likes to put it this way, “If I was purposely going to a gunfight, I'd use something else.” So would I, as a matter of fact. However, that isn't the point. We aren't going to gunfights, we simply want the ability to defend ourselves and our families should we be unexpectedly forced to do so. In this regard, the Ruger LCR shines. It is easily carried, swift to deploy, manageable in recoil allowing for confident initial shot and follow-up shot placement, is clearly a well-built, and fundamentally reliable protection piece.

The LCR is available with laser grips, but the approach I prefer has just been announced by XS Sight Systems for 2010, an improved standard dot Tritium front sight for the Ruger Part Number: RP-0008N-4. I'll get one installed as soon as I can.

The Ruger LCR is a rare revolver, one that is optimized for a specific application, and fulfills the fast handling, ease of use, speed of use, outstanding build quality with a mass produced, double-action trigger pull that has never before been equaled in this personal self-defense platform. It is a home-run for Ruger and a winner in this category of this revolver with no question in my mind. Ruger has extended and improved the breed with their little LCR .38 Special +P."

Also included are:

Phantom MX is a 100 Grain 4 blade broadhead that features a 1-1/8"" x 1"" cutting diameter and like our other MX-Series heads offers shorter profile with less blade surface for superior flight and maximum accuracy, even at high speeds. The Phantom MX also features .040"" thick main blades and .036"" thick ""Bleeder Blades"" for maximum strength and durability.

I had intended to mount a hunting scope on this and use it on my AR15, but never got around to it, and have since decided to go in another direction with my rifle/optic setup.

This would be great for someone who wishes to place a riser under a red dot (for co-witness purposes), or who wishes to add QD capability to their optic.

774,http://www.armslist.com/posts/181774,"For Sale:  voodoo tactical 36"" tactical bag","magazine/russellville, Arkansas, United States",$ 75,"Listed On: Monday, August 22, 2011",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This case is designed to hold one or two of the M-4 carbines with a collapsible stock and a 16 inch barrel. It will also hold similar carbines with a collapsible stock, a folding stock rifle, or any other weapon that is under 35 inches in overall length. This 36-inch Voodoo Tactical brand padded rifle carrying case will help protect your rifle from the hard knocks of transportation, whether in your vehicle or in the field. It can also be used if you break down your gun or to carry different uppers. 

Inside are two sets of adjustable tie downs so that you can be sure your optics are not going to get knocked about. The attention to detail and heavy thick foam on all six sides is a welcome change from the standard nylon case that has foam only on two sizes or the flimsy egg-crate foam of some hard-shell cases. It even features additional padding to protect your muzzle and the zippers are tough enough to meet the demanding conditions required by the military and law enforcement. 

Behind the pouches, there's a second compartment with two padded pouches built in. Each is designed to hold a pistol, but you could also use these for optics or other accessories. 

This case comes with the three external pouches you see here, giving you plenty of storage space for magazines, boxes of ammo, cleaning kits, your log book and other accessories. The three exterior pouches have gussets, making them hold far more than you would think. The two outside pouches can hold five or six standard size magazines and the center pouch is even larger. 

This Voodoo Tactical gun case features three carrying methods: A standard handle in center of the bag, a shoulder strap, and back-pack style shoulder harness. This backpack style carry is great for long distances. And if you use the PAL webbing to attach MOLLE or ALICE pouches, you can haul even more gear."

Great starter pistol or for Concealed Carry. I have bought a different CC pistol and no longer need this one. This pistol is in great shape and has already been warranty repaired by Colorado Gun Works. These pistols have a factory problem of a spring jumping out the notch that is suppose to ride in and then fires erractically. CGW has machined the notch a little deeper and then inserted the spring and staked it off. Unlike a lot of other Bersa's out there, this one will now fire reliably when needed. Great pistol, just not needed anymore. Comes with factory box, key for integrated trigger lock, external trigger lock, factory test round, blackhawk holster, and factory magazine. One of the coolest features of this pistol is that fact that it is a Double Action/Single Action pistol with a De-cocker. This means you can breach a bullet into the chamber and then de-cock it. So then if you needed to defend yourself it will take a harder, safer, double action trigger pull to get the first round off. Then every round after that is single action. Love this feature. Alot of your smaller CC pistol are Double Action only, of which is not nearly as accurate as single action. Email if you would like to set up a meet to look at this pistol.

I have seen these rifles go for almost twice this price.

Marked as Izhevsk 1932 with the sturdy Octagonal receiver.  It has a PU type scope and this combined with the octagonal receiver mean that this is a re-arsenaled rifle (sent back to Izhevsk arsenal to be reconditioned - likely in the 1950's) prior to import.

Rifle is 7.62X54r -very powerful.
Rifle comes with 30 rounds of non corrosive ammo.

All serial numbers match (barrel, butt plate, bolt, and magazine floor). These are not a force match, these are original serials.

It has the sniper bent bolt (not aftermarket). 

Scope is clear and in great condition.  Rifling is sharp with bright lands and dark grooves.  Muzzle is not countersunk and is in great shape.  Stock appears to be original and not laminated. Bluing is good in most places and about right for an 80 year old rifle.  Bolt action is smooth.  Everything works on this rifle.  

FTF Cash or trade.  Must have Ohio DL and be willing to sign Bill of Sale.  I get to Columbus several times a week so I can meet there or MV.

I may flex a little on price but I won't give this away as it has matching numbers and is in great shape.  Shoot me an offer if you are interested.  The worst I can say is no."

These are the infamous Black Talon rounds produced in the 90's by Winchester that got all the anti-gunners stirred up.  The evil black bullets, evil name, and bad publicity forced Winchester to discontinue production.   They are more of a collectors item than a shooting ammo. It appears I have the second version.  The original version had nickel plated cases.

They have been kept in a sealed ammo can since I bought them so they are good clean ammo. I have fired a few and they work great. 

Since these are a collectors item, and I am not a collector, I thought I would put them up for sale and see if anyone's interested.  $50.00 a bag  (50 rounds).  Cash only.  Pick up in Wakefield Kansas or I can meet you in Junction City.."

893,http://www.armslist.com/posts/181893,"For Sale:  Class 3 Dealer, NFA Items, Machine guns, Silencers, SBR, SBS, AOW, NOW Using Eforms and have reduced waiting times!!!","SW OKLA., Oklahoma, United States",$ 150,"Listed On: Monday, June 16, 2014",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"We are a class 3 dealer located in SW Okla. I do NFA transfers for items you have already purchased. I also sale Silencers (all brands), transferable machine guns (yes civilians can own machine guns), SBR's (short barrel rifle), SBS's (short barrel shotgun), and AOW's (any other weapons). If you have a certain thing you are looking for please contact me at 580six95eight340 and leave a message if no answer, or email me at REDACTED . Silencers start at $199.00 and the process is very simple. If you can buy a handgun legally in the state of Oklahoma then you can buy a silencer.  
We have silencers for .22LR that start at $145.00, silencers for AR-15's/5.56 calibers that start at $425.00, and 7.62mm silencers that start at $499.00. We are now using ATF's new Eform system and it has reduced the wait time from 10 months to 3-5 months. Hurry and get yours before the wait time gets bumped back up. Our prices are ALL below MSRP and we will price match if you find a better price. Military is welcome to purchase suppressors as long as you are PCS in Oklahoma. If you chain of command allows it you can take these on deployments since we know that only the ""cool guys"" get them issued. You never know this could be the piece of equipment that helps save your life or someone else. It helps reduce recoil, keeps your situational awareness, and reduces your muzzle signature when you fire. These are just a few reasons that they could benefit a combat soldier. I sale all major brands of silencers so if you have a special request just ask. It is now legal to hunt with silencers in Oklahoma so get one before the wait gets longer. Anyone who can buy a handgun should be able to qualify for a silencer. I will complete all paperwork for you and make the transfer a smooth and easy process. If you decide to put your suppressor in a trust which I recommend, I can assist you with the process and you won't have to get the CLEO sign off or fingerprints. ATF has proposed to start making trusts also get the CLEO sign off and fingerprints but it is not in effect yet so hurry before the process gets more difficult. Transferable MAC 10 Machine guns typically start at $4500.00 and go up from there. The process for transferable machine guns is the same for silencers, and YES civilians in Oklahoma can own machine guns and you only have to pay the one time $200.00 for the ATF tax stamp when you purchase it. I am an experienced class 3 dealer and if you have any other class 3 or NFA needs or questions please contact me at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED. Leave a message in reference to what you are calling about if I don't answer and I will call you back ASAP. Thanks.
