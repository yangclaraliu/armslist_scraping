My bet is your a gun snob that thinks you have to spend $600+ for anything worth owning, maybe you should try one of these and have some real fun shooting a reliable low budget firearm.

The gun does have markings on it- a capitol F with a small capitol T to the right of ""F"" on lower left hand side of barrel and a sideways X on flat of same side of barrel, also 20 stamped into ejector plate & face of cylinder.  He said there is a possibility it is an experimental or prototype Pryse and if so it would be worth a few grand.  Anyone know of a collector/ dealer around Ft. Collins that can tell?  The last guy said even if it's a clone, since rare, would bring $200-300

.45 cal  breach action with ejector 
Double action kinda

It actions & looks cool, no clue what it is or if will fire.
Put it on the wall, use it for cowboy photos, great paperweight.

There are no markings/ identification on the gun.
I've taken it to a couple shops & still don't know what it is.
Kind of looks like an old Mexican pistol.

Smith & Wesson Model 916T Field Grade 12 ga Pump Shotgun LNIB


The only S&W shotgun that was ever MADE IN USA. Not all 916T's were created equal. This one is a rare version of the 916T that has:

- Wildlife Scene (Duck in flight with Catails) Engraved in the Receiver
- Checkering in the Forearm and Grip
- White Line Spacers at the Recoil Pad and Pistol Grip Cap 
- Two-Bead Wavy Top Ventilated Rib.
- Correct O stamp Barrel (NO Recall) with Chrome Bore

This is the barrel that shipped with the gun, not a S&W recall replacement barrel, so the gun must have been a very late one with the revisions already in place. The barrel is 28"" and Steel Shot Safe.


In all the years I have owned the gun I have never seen another one like it (I saw 'one' that was similar but did not have the correct barrel). Every other 916T I have seen was the plain jane version with no engraving, no checkering, no spacer's, if they had a VR at all it was a standard one, and all, but a handful, did not have the correct O stamped barrel which can be dangerous.


Barrel Markings on Left Side:

SMITH & WESSON - MODEL 916T
SPRINGFIELD, MA., - MADE IN U.S.A.

Right Side:

PROOF TESTED 12 GA.
- 3 INCH CHAMBER -
MODIFIED CHOKE


I bought the gun brand new many years ago. Fired 50~100 rounds. I have the original box, but cannot find the paperwork.


Please no message's quoting book value as this gun is simply not in the book with the feature's that it has. The book lists only the plain jane 916T with a potentially dangerous barrel.

Rifle has maybe 200 rounds through it before duracoating. It has been fully dis-assembled, sand blasted, and coated with 4 coats of DuraCoat SL. The SL is self lubricating and will make this thing run smooth as can be with hardly any oil. I have 4 32round mags and 1 15round mag that come with it. I have installed a new Buffer Technologies Neoprene buffer (if you choose to ""bump fire"" this increases the fire rate to over 1500 rounds per minute-and will handle the abuse) and I installed a larger raised cocking handle. It comes with the original cocking handle also, both were duracoated at the same time as the rest of the gun. Has a Tasco red dot scope with a brand new battery. Bore looks brand new and is accurate as can be. Bolt block was disassembled and coated internally and externally. This thing is a great plinker and is something all your friends will beg to shoot. And being 9mm is the cheapest fun you can have, especially if you start laying down 32 round bursts. If you do bump it through a full mag, it will empty the whole clip before the first shell casing hits the ground. I'm open to almost all trades but prefer the cash, don't be offended if I don't want your cheap hi-point pistol tho. Feel free to ask any questions or for more pics. Soft case NOT included."

The enfield is in overall good shape. The bore is a little darker but the rifleing is strong. The rifle has been reblued but that was before I got it. The stock does have a hole in one side of it that you can see the stock bolt through because to much wood was removed when it was sporterized. 

This would be a great project rifle if you're looking for something to work on or a great hunting rifle as is.

With the rifle I am including a case, an extra bolt head, and close to 150 rounds of surplus ammo (106 rounds of 1960's Pakistanie ammo and 40 rounds of 1944 british surplus ammo in striper clips in a canves battle pack).

The 1st AR is a high standard flat top with the A2 stock and has a 16in barrel.  It also has a surefire 660 light with pressure and toggle tape switch.  This rifle has less than 100 rounds through it.  I would like $1000 for this rifle with the light and everything but i am willing to negotiate a little

The 2nd AR i have I got in a trade.  Had the gas tube and bolt repaired by hoover tactical firearms.  This is a bushmaster with a 20in national match barrel.  It does have a problem though.  It seems to keep jamming or not feeding the next round.  Probably a simple fix like replacing the stock spring.  I just dont want to put any more cash into it.  Also comes with an NcStar quad rail.  I would like $1000 obo on it.  I'm willing to negotiate quite a bit on this one given it has issues so just make me an offer.  As long as it isn't stupid low i'll probably take it.

The 1911 i bought used at hoover tactical.  I've put 2 mags through it since then and it has just sat on my night stand.  Has after market grips (not sure what brand.  They came with the gun when i bought it), the box with paperwork, and 3 loaded mags and an in waist band holster.  I would like $600 obo for this.  Again i am willing to negotiate.

The grip and back strap, If you've ever handled one of these SW99's feels like a bar of soap. Even with the thin back strap they have a large hump. The hump was shaved and the back strap lines blended. The grip texture is like a medium to coarse grit sandpaper. The grip texture is very pleasant even after several rounds. The grip was shaped to simulate a 1911 with an arched mainspring housing. It has a Bedair custom built stainless captured guide rod and will include the stock polymer rod. XS Big Dot night sights tops off the package (XS is now used by the US Navy Seals) and comes with 3 factory 9 round magazines, factory box, sights and literature. Also in the deal is a new Aker high ride black leather right hand paddle holster. The SW99 series pistol have a very unique trigger system. You can carry the first round as double action. Or in the long single action, or in the short single action, and at anytime there is a de-cocker located on top of the slide. The de-cocker is very easy to operated with either hand and the magazine release is also ambidextrous and very much like the H&K USP's mounted on both sides at the rear of the trigger guard. I like using my right index finger to operate the mag release and my off hand thumb to operate the de-cocker. The pistol also incorporates a firing pin block that is only released at the full depression of the trigger. S&W is the manufacturer of the slide & barrels and Walther is the maker of the frames on the S&W SW99 series pistols. To date S&W is the only company to manufacture this pistol design in the 45 ACP. Currently Walther & Magnum Research are still manufacturing these in 9mm & .40 S&W only."

A Little History

The Commando Special was a limited time offering from Colt.

During the big Colt strike of the mid-1980's, Colt didn't have enough polishers still working to do the amount of work needed.

So, they introduced a series of Colt revolvers with unpolished black finishes, and had the available polishers concentrate on the premium guns like the Python, and the easier to polish 1911 autos.

These were nothing more than standard guns, only unpolished and with flat black parkerized finishes.

There was a ""Peacekeeper"" which was an unpolished Trooper Mark V, an unpolished Detective Special known as the ""Commando Special"" and an unpolished Cobra and Agent.

For unknown reasons, Colt didn't assign special names to the unpolished Agent and Cobra versions.

The Commando Special was only made from 1984 to 1986.

The buying public didn't care for these unpolished guns, so as soon as the strike ended they were dropped.

Internally, the guns were the same quality as the polished guns."

I am the original owner, and this gun has seen about 400rds, varying Winchester White Box and Blazer Brass ammunition.  Zero failures, and shoots fantastic!

I will include another 2 mags, for a total of 4 OEM16-rd mags.  Also included, is an OEM mag with Arredondo 5-rd extension plus hi-power spring for 21 rds (FLAWLESS OPERATION and includes stock spring and base).

I will also include an XD Guys extended slide stop, along with the stock piece.

It is very ugly with a lot of rust, pits, no blueing to speak of.  Any wood on this is cracked wood. This certainly is not that nice Patina that collectors desire, it is ugly rust that you may die from touching.  
I cannot imagine there is another person on the planet, like myself, that would actually want to own this gun.  Prior to handling this Browning you may consider getting a Tetanus shot. It doesn't even smell that great.  I understand this sat in the back of a pick-up for several years.  Initially I thought that meant behind the seat, but for all I know it looks like it sat in the truck bed.  I cannot believe the bolt even opens.  One thing that throws me off is the rod that comes out of the stock, it still looks good for some reason, which is why I hate that ""uppity"" part of the rifle.  And the rifling in the bore... don't get me started.  I wanted to pour some rust growth down the nearly perfect barrel just so it would match the outside.  Despicable how clean the bore is to how ugly the rest of the rifle is.  
Most of the checkering on the furniture has been rubbed off.  The hole in the stock where you stick it in is also in good condition for being a hole that is 49 years old!  If there ever was a Browning trademark on the trigger guard, it has been replaced by a bunch of rust.  The rear sight looks like it has seen better days, and the front sight looks like cancer is starting to take it over.  
Currently, it's best performing trick is coming apart into two pieces.  It still does this well.
I usually don't post my entire serial number of a gun for the public to see, but what is the worst you are going to do?  Call Browning and make a warranty claim using my 49 year old serial number? 
SN:2T41417 ... Yes, that is correct, the end of this serial number is THIS AREA CODE!!!  (417) BABY!!!  
What's that?  Have I shot it?  Nope, I have not even tried.  I am concerned some of the rust will come off, and may even embed itself in my skin.  Being a Belgium Browning, this damn thing will probably still fire 49 years later even if it is as rough as Charlie Sheen on 1/2 price p0rn star night.  
How much?  Too much.  $475 and you are welcome to send me hate emails telling me how you bought one for $75 back in 1901 at Sears and they served you with a smile.  Awesome for you, mine is $475.  
They quite making this Belgium Browning in 1974, so all that are ever going to be produced were done 37 years ago.  I think this WAS considered a ""Grade 1"" but now it is ""Rusty Rifle #1"".
If you made it this far, you have as much time on your hand as I do.  Blame it on Sarah Palin and Obama is 1/2 white."

( 1st ) It has a highly polished blued 22"" inch heavy tapered match grade Varmint barrel, That is heavier than a standard barrel is around the chamber for slightly stronger hunting loads, Without having to go to the extreme extra weight a Target style bull barrel...

( 2nd ) It also has a forged milled steel receiver, That is factory milled to accept Ruger style scope rings, For a precision mounting of optics...

( 3rd ) It also has a factory hand ( Lapped, Fitted, & Polished ) chrome hardened bolt assembly, That is precisely fitted for a smooth action...

( 4th ) Next it has the modern 3 postition side lever safety on it, It has a firing position, A trigger safe postion, And a firing pin block locking position, So that the firearm can be safely transported while it is loaded...

( 5th ) Then it has a beautiful solid hardwood Walnut stock, That is finished in a very nice semi gloss finish, For a beautiful lustrious look that is not to shiny glossy that it would scare off any game...

( 6th ) The stock is also fully checkered on the front and rear grip areas of the rifle stock, To get a good solid firm grip on the rifles stock, So that way the shooter can make a good solid controlled shot on his target...

( 7th ) It also has front and rear factory installed sling swivel studs, That are percisely ( Centered, Drilled, and Factory installed ) to add a harris bi-pod or any type of stud mounted carrying sling...

( 8th ) It also has a factory installed 3/4"" inch neopreme rubber recoil reducing butt plate with the Ruger logo embedded in it, This is not the standard cheap plastic or the thin hard rubber one that is found on the standard models...

( 9th ) It also has a hinged lower floor plate to quickly and safely unload the internal box magazine, Instead of having to jack them out of the action one at a time using the bolt...

( 10th ) It also has a pistol grip lower bottom end cap plate, With the Ruger medalion logo on the bottom of the pistol grip area, Which also helps to protect this area from chips and small cracks if it is light bumped around....

This is the top of the line limited edition M-77 varmint hunting rifle that Ruger made a couple years back, This is not a standard cheaper M-77 model, That a lot of you guys out there are looking up, And then trying to give me a lowball offer or asking me to trade for cheap thing, So please don't waste your time or mine trying to haggle, This piece cost just over $829 dollar a couple years back, Serious inquiries only on this item, please do not waste our time...

Trades I will consider would be a good quality concealed carry piece with some extras and ammo included in with it, Or a nice 1911 style pistol in ( 9mm, 40S&W, or 45acp ), I am an Ohio resident on the Eastern side of Ohio, Mainly looking to trade FTF with other residents in Ohio with proper state photo ID, Interested parties must be willing to drive to my location, As I am disabled and have problems on long distance drives...

So let me know what you have to offer in trade and we can go from there, The worst I can say is no thank you, And if I am interested in your offer, I would want some pictures of it to look over, Also before I will actually commit to any trade offer, I would have to look the item over in person to make sure it is what we agreed to, And to make sure it is in satifactory condition..."

I have fired approximately 200 rounds through it. It runs flawlessly. They retail over $700."

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety."

From www.tapco.com:
>>>>
Continuing our trend of modular stock systems, the INTRAFUSE® Mini-14/Thirty Stock System gives you countless options to customize your stock. Do you want to use the optics or the iron sights? The answer doesn’t matter because we give you two different receiver extensions that let you choose either option. The straight extension offers a perfectly aligned cheek weld when shooting with optics and the angled extension gives you unrestricted use of the iron sights.

Maybe some days you want to use a forward grip but other days, you just don’t feel like having a vertical grip protruding from the underside of the stock body. Again, the choice is yours because this stock system has a bottom Picatinny rail with removable cover. Aren’t comfortable with the length of the rifle? With our 6 position adjustable buttstock, we let you pick how long you’d like your rifle for the most comfortable setup. These are just a few examples of how we’re putting the power into the customer’s hands to make their Mini-14 work for them. This stock system also includes  a SAW Style Pistol Grip, and is complete made in the USA out of military grade composite. When it comes to the INTRAFUSE® Mini-14/Thirty Stock System, there is no better choice for your favorite rifle.

TWO DAY SALE REDUCTION!!!

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer. check link for a better pic.

Might be a shot in the dark but I was looking for a VR6 engine swap for my car. If you know about volkswagens then you will know what I am looking for. If not then you don't need to read any farther as I am not trading for anything else. I know some one around the Columbus area has to have a swap sitting around.

It is for a MK3 so I mainly just need the engine, tranny, clutch master cylinder, clutch slave cylinder, clutch assembly, ecu, and wiring harness. It can be obd2 or obd1. I DO NOT need the cv axles or pedal cluster or subframe... just the stuff listed above. I have done these swaps before so I know how to do them. I want a motor that isn't blown the f out. It can be coilpack or dizzy but I prefer coilpack.

If you are looking for an AR15 rifle and have one of these engine swaps sitting around let me know. If I don't get any responses from people with a swap in the next couple weeks I am just keeping this rifle. I will ignore trades for guns, I already have too many guns.

The rifle has cheap A2 handguards on it now that dont fit together right. I just bought them new and they came to me like this. I will be getting a set of magpul MOE handguards for it. It has a BCM bolt upgrade kit in it that I just installed with new extractor and extractor spring and gas rings."

You can shoot it vertically (almost out of sight) or horizontal, the tongue reciprocates utilizing the 2 gas shocks when shooting horizontal to greatly reduce the recoil.
