The price on this is $650. That price is firm. I will just put this back in the safe rather than be lowballed. I will consider cash plus ammo if you have factory 45 acp ammo. I will also consider a trade for a Colt or other quality 1911, and I can add 500 rounds cowboy action ammo to make the deal right as well.

The first person to text and setup a deal will take this rifle home (but please note that if you say you'll take it, it means you need to come pick it up in SE Portland, and within a day or so, I can't hold this for weeks waiting and passing up other offers.

Love the gun but it's the only one I've got worth selling.  I don't think I've put 300 rounds through it, and I paid right around $1200 after taxes and such.  I did put one little scratch on the slide.  You know how it is, that one time I decided to carry it I had to go somewhere and throw it under the seat for a minute.  Holster was another roughly $80, it's a leather pancake with a thumb break.  I want to say its a Bianchi but I don't have it in front of me.  Ammo is about $14 a box and there's 5 of them, Federal 230 grain FMJ.

This is a really good deal.  I'll go $900 without the ammo because I have another 45 but I have no use for the holster so that comes with it either way.

Thanks for looking.

It is in excellent / like new condition.  I did however, get the wood stock sprayed with black bed liner to weather proof it.  Though I never ended up needing it weatherproofed because it's never left my house.  It looks awesome that way though.

This is a powerful, multishot pellet gun.  It shoots at 1000fps.  It uses a rotary clip so it's not necessary to load a pellet manually after each shot.  It is extremely quiet and has absolutely zero kick.

It's had less than 100 pellets put through it.  Looks like a brand new gun.

It will come with three rotary mags, a sling stud mounted bipod and scope rings (NO SCOPE).

Also, it does not come with a pump.  You'll need your own pump, compressor or scuba tank to fill it with air.  I use a scuba tank and you can get around 40 fills of the gun on a full scuba tank.  The scuba tank itself cost around $8 to fill.

$300 OBO (retail for this gun is around $475...that is what I paid for it).

I'm also interested in trades...  Primarily for Marlin 1894 style rifles.

Finish - absolutely beautiful Colt bluing, no notable flaws, no noticeable wear, not brand new, but like new. Estimated 98%. 

$1,150 plus costs of shipping/transfer.  Buyer responsible for price, plus costs of shipping/transfer.

Manufactured in 1975, this pistol features a blade front sight and Colt Elliason adjustable rear sight, adjustable trigger stop, skeletonized serrated alloy trigger and checkered walnut grips with gold Colt medallions. The right side of the slide is marked ""GOLD CUP / NATIONAL MATCH"" followed by the trophy and the left side is marked ""COLT'S MK IV/SERIES '70 / GOLD CUP NATIONAL MATCH / .45 AUTOMATIC CALIBER"" followed by the Rampant Colt. The accurized barrel is blue with a polished chamber marked ""COLT .45 AUTO. N.M. / MK.IV SERIES 70"". 

The box and related materials lost in fire several years ago - no box etc.  I am selling to make room for recent custom purchases. Kindly note that I was four (4) years old when the gun was manufactured and thereafter (relatively recently) acquired from an Estate (gun dealer/FFL estimated condition at north of 98%). I never spoke to the deceased, god bless his soul. The gun looks as if it was hardly used/shot and instead spent its time in a safe; that said and unless the deceased, god bless him, decides to impart some  guidance fromn above, I will never know what the man did with the gun except to say he appeared to have cared a great deal for it.

Given the foregoing, please do not ask me nonsense like ""how many rounds"", or similarly annoying questions most commonly raised by ""window"" shoppers and similarly pesky little fellows who know very well they can't/won't be buying (t/d/b/a ""strokers"").

The Mossberg 930 SPX Tactical has an aluminum receiver, a tactically sound 18.5” steel barrel, an extended magazine tube and a tough but lightweight synthetic stock. The gas-operated, semi-automatic shotgun is a direct descendant of the excellent Mossberg 930 hunting guns. The shared self-regulating gas operating system reduces recoil and eases stress on its components by venting whatever excess gas isn’t required to cycle the action.

The system uses two gas ports in the barrel to power a piston that surrounds the magazine tube under the barrel. The set-up gives the Mossberg a bit of a chunky for-end (to accommodate the moving parts), but nothing that looks out of place. The 930 SPX functions smoothly and reliably without a gas seal ring."

Hey Gents! 

""BOY DO I GOT ONE HERE"" I found this lady in the safe last night! Talk about ""RARE""! I have a ""Custom Model 64-3"" and she is ""PRETTIER THAN THE PROM QUEEN”! Yep, ""You Guessed It"", ""She’s got a custom 6"" barrel that is perfect for Target Shooting or any IDPA competition!  A professional gunsmith has put a custom trigger job on her, that gorgeous 6” bull, and full aristocrat upper with custom target sights!  WOW!  Talk about headshots… EVERYTIME!

Want more details?  YOU GOT IT!  The Competition Action & Smith Work makes this the Ultimate Revolver! The action on this combine techniques learned from some of the most respected professionals in the Midwest! From there we got our hands on her and broke her down to the bone… full Zombie work to smooth her out and make sure that there is no way you will get any gunk up after shooting! The internals were lightly coated in Zombie Blood and the mechanical parts that typically collect gunk and residue were also given a nice coat of ZB!   I call it a “Z-Job”.

This Rare ""Silvered Crippler"" sports the ""DOUBLE T'S"" (That's Target grade Trigger and Hammer, naturally they are my favorites of All Time 

Gents, This Revolver is lucky to have had 250 rounds fired through her.  She has only been out a few times for Dot drills! 

Speaking of “Dots”… We only shoot double action!  I have shot 19’s (DA) consistently with her and have personally witnessed a Double Action 29 shot (WTF Literally an impossible feat.).  Hearing that you know you are getting the crème de la crème of accurate shooters!

Some have asked why not 357 Mag?  Well given the casing and the way it sets into the barrel, studies have shown that .38 special can be more accurate!  We both know that if you are shooting competition for accuracy that can and will matter. 

If you smoking your competition at a PPC or IDPA match or are poppin’ Zombies at 50 yards I can promise this crippler will be your go to firearm… its that good!

This is ONE GREAT SHOOTING OR COLLECTING SMITH REVOLVER, the Choice is Yours! These Photos Were Taken today but, were not set with the ""ZOOM"" features on my camera (Which I always Usually have)! 

By The Way Gents, ""THERES HARDLY EVEN A FRECKLE ON HER""!  She’s as perfect as perfect gets… the ""CREAM OF THE CROP""! 

I have been offered upwards of $1300.00 for this best but, at the time was not ready to give her a new home.  Like that say... ""Every dog has her day"" and today is the day I am deciding to let her call another man (or woman) daddy!  I am pretty open on her at this time so feel free to make an offer... cash or trade.

MUST HAVE FOID CARD 

Feel free to contact with questions or for additional pictures.

She is ready to be picked up or shipped From My Favorite FFL to Your Local Hometown Favorite Gun Shop! I ship via UPS (you pay next day shipping) No Hassel - Smooth as Silk - And Legal as Eagles! 

Gents, Thanks for Viewing!  

Respectively,

Bobby Cundiff (Owner of Zombie Blood Custom Gun Co.)!

The all stainless steel frame and slide of the STX are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance. The frame features 25-line per inch checkering on the front strap – while the mainspring housing has 20-line per inch checkering – and both the frame and slide are de-horned for comfortable full-size carry. Like all SIG SAUER products the 1911 STX pistol contains only premium internal parts including a match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. For safety the 1911 STX features a beavertail grip safety with speed bump, extended ambidextrous thumb safety, firing pin safety and hammer intercept notch and ships in a plastic gun case with cable lock."

It is ADL, so it has the internal blind magazine. The action of this gun is very smooth and it loads and shoots perfectly. It has a refinished wood stock, that has a few marks here and there on it. The gun includes Weaver ""rolling scope mounts"". These allow you to use a scope or the iron sights. I have a picture below showing how they work. They are very nice!

There is one crack in the stock near the front sling screw, from over-tightening that screw. The screw hole there also is pretty worn out, and the screw doesn't stay in very well. This gun most likely will need a new stock if it will be used heavily. I have a picture of the crack below as well.

The gun itself though works great and is great condition. The blueing on the receiver and barrel looks great. Like I said, the bolt operates very smoothly and has no problems whatsoever. Unknown round count

I would like to sell the gun as is for $400 FTF.

On the side I have a few side items for it:
About 30 rounds of 165gr PSP 30-06 ammo- $25
Bushnell 6-18x40mm scope with japanese lenses- $150.
High-mount scope rings- $15 (used on the Bushnell scope because of the large lens size


I will sell everything as a whole for $575. I will also trade for a nice compound bow."

All serial numbers match.

The idea of the compact firearm that will fire cartridge of intermediate power, allowing for effective range of about 500-800 meters or so caught on with Soviets who were set up to build a whole family of infantry weapons, designed around newly developed M43 7.62x39mm cartridge. This family included following guns: lightweight bolt action carbine - an idea that never left the prototype stage; a self-loading carbine; a select-fire assault rifle; and a light machine gun - squad automatic weapon. Assault rifle became the famous Kalashnikov AK-47. Squad automatic became the Degtyarov RPD. And self-loading carbine became the Simonov SKS.

The SKS (Samozaryadnyj Karabin Simonova = Simonov Self-loading Carbine) was designed by famous Russian arms designer Simonov, who already designed the self-loading rifle AVS-36 and an anti-tank rifle PTRS. First prototypes were built in the early 1945, and were tested in small numbers on the front against Germans. In consequent years both SKS and the cartridge were refined and in 1949 this carbine was officially adopted by the Soviet Army as an ""7.62mm Samozaryadnyj Karabin Simonova obr. 1945 goda - SKS"". SKS was brought into service along with the Kalashnikov AK-47, and was widely used during the first two or three post-war decades. With the increased numbers of the AK-47 and AKM brought into service, numbers of the SKS in the front-line services gradually declined, but some SKS were still used by non-infantry and second-line units of the Soviet Army as late as 1980s and even 1990s. At the present time most army stocks of SKS are in storage or sold as surplus on both domestic and foreign markets, and the most notable role of the SKS is that it is still used as a ceremonial weapon by the various Russian Honor Guards.

As with many other soviet weapons of the post-war period, the licenses to SKS design were sold or given to some Soviet-friendly countries, such as China, DDR (East Germany), Yugoslavia, Albania and some others. These countries also built vast numbers of SKS with some minor derivations from original design. So, Chinese SKS featured spike-shaped bayonets instead of original blade-shaped ones. Yugoslavian SKS carbines often were equipped with combined muzzle device - rifle grenade launcher, grenade sights and a gas cut-offs. Other variations also existed. Many off those carbines, along with the original Russian ones, were sold as a military surplus during the last decades, either in the original for or in the ""civilized"" form, with bayonets removed. Cheap prices of both carbines and 7.62x39mm ammunition added to a popularity of SKS on the civilian markets. Being a sound, but outdated military design, SKS is a great all-around civilian arm, capable of numerous functions: small and even a medium game hunting, plinking, home defense. Wide variety of aftermarket accessories (stocks, sight mounts, sights, large-capacity magazines, bipods etc etc) only helped to keep this neat gun on the market.

SKS is a gas operated, magazine fed, self-loading weapon. It utilizes a short-stroke gas piston with its own return spring, and a tilting bolt locking, where a bolt tips down to lock onto the floor of the receiver. Charging handle is attached to the right side of the bolt carrier and moves when gun is fired. Receiver is machined from steel. SKS is fed from the integral 10-rounds magazine, which could be loaded from the top through the open bolt by loose cartridges or by using special 10 rounds stripper clips. Stripper clip guides are machined into the front of the bolt carrier. SKS features a bolt catch device, an essential feature for any clip-loaded firearm. Magazine can be safely and quickly unloaded via swing-down opening magazine cover. SKS is a hammer-fired gun. Safety switch is located inside the triggerguard. SKS features a single-piece wooden stock, a hooded post-type front sight and a range-adjustable open rear sight. Military-issue SKS carbines are equipped with non-detachable bayonets, that could be folded down and backward when not in use. Soviet, East German and Yugoslavian carbines use blade-shaped bayonets, Chinese Type 56 carbines use spike-shaped bayonets, which are slightly longer than blade-shaped ones.

In general, the SKS is an excellent all-around weapon that offers slightly longer range and better accuracy than Kalashnikov AK-47, but, for military use, lacks the magazine capacity and selective-fire capabilities. But for civilian use it's still hard to beat, especially when it comes to the cost/effectiveness issues."

Has only had maybe 30 rounds through it max. Comes with a pistol grip and a rifle butt stock. It has a blued finish. Asking 360, price not set in stone. 
If purchased before the 1st of May, I will throw in a very nice rifle bag.

I have dropped my asking price from 400 to 360. Effectively you are getting a brand new Mossberg 500 for 360$. No tax, no transfer fee, no dealer fee, no shipping fee. Comes with an awesome rifle bag.
**I dropped the price after realizing you can order one brand new for 289 (not including tax, shipping, or ffl fee) so I believe 360 is fair."

This gun is not perfect as it is used but as you can see it is very pretty and a solid rifle. The gun has a 22"" barrel with a clean bright bore and strong rifling.  it is mounted with a Glenfield scope as well, there is a spot near the butt stock were the finish is off and a couple of spots were the stock does have some paint transfer from leaning on a wall.   I bought it to transfer the stock to another model 60 I had but it would not fit it.  Great little starter rifle for a kid, or good for anyone to just plink with.  Rifling and bore are very good.

It can be used to carry (about the size of a p229, but the p6 is single stack so is much slimmer) or to add to your collection, especially if you are a Sig nut. 

This comes with old school Sig Sauer box and 2 magazines.


- Standard sights, original grips
- DA/SA, decocker (like most Sig models)
