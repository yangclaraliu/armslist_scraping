Has a 19"" inch barrel with a monster claw brake attached to it. It eliminates muzzle climb and reduces recoil. Has an aircraft aluminum grade quad rail with vertical grip. Truglo red dot/holographic sight with four different reticles, red or green. Magpul collapsible stock with ATI scorpion grip. Can also still use factory iron sights, under the top half of the quad rail. Also has a 6 setting gas plug(beats the hell out of the factory 2!)  and a custom gas puck. This saiga was manufactured on 03/22/12. Comes with original box, paperwork and factory cleaning kit. One twenty round drum, two ten round SGM magazines and the factory five round.  This saiga runs like a raped ape and feels more like a 20 gauge. You can run all kinds of loads, including slugs(a lot of ppl ask if you can shoot slugs out of it?). It is NOT set up to shoot the low pressure/low brass loads. FTF only, will not ship. Must show ID and your license to carry. If no license to carry we will go to FFL for transfer.

Gun is in very immaculate condition, I would say 95% or better. No cracks in the stock, only one or two little marks on the barrels. Barrels are ported straight from the factory. It does not have exposed hammers. Definitely a beast of a shooter, it's a pretty heavy gun so that takes away a lot of the recoil that comes with a 10 gauge. I don't have to sell or get rid of the gun, just seeing what all is out there. Also comes with a nearly full box of shells. It's a real quality piece, do your research and you'll see for yourself. If you're interested, just shoot me an email and make an offer. I'll upload pictures later today"

This weapon is in outstanding condition. It has never failed me and I have taken extremely good care of it. 

I've priced this at its actual value to help out a fellow New Yorker. This is not inflated and I'm not going to try to take advantage of the political climate. This is a once and a lifetime offer to get one of the highest quality AR's before they need to be grandfathered in NY.

EDIT::: Please note that the price is firm and this is for local sale only. I've received a number of emails on the rifle and I would like to complete the sale as soon as possible. Please call: REDACTED if you can do a cash, local sale today."

I decided to go back to bow hunting again now that i can do it again. So no need for my shack. The shack is 4ft wide around 8ft long and the ceiling is about 6ft2in. Theres 1/4in thick plexi glass windows 360degrees that you can shoot out of. there's 2 swivel chairs in it. two big guys can hunt out of it comfortably. I have had two big guys and a kid in there with no problems at all. its tin sited outside. all the walls and ceiling has 6inch insulation in them. floor is solid as a rock. Its sitting on and bolted to a pipe frame. the frame is around 4ft if i remember right. Has one door to enter the shack. this thing took the 100mph wind we had a couple  years ago and didnt even move it. Theres a small heater in it that goes with it that will keep it nice and toasty even in single digit weather with a cold wind. its darn near air tight if it aint air tight. holds heat for a long time. The windows have shelfs to rest your rifle on as well. If your tired of sitting in the cold and in the snow when rifle hunting then this is your ticket. I gave 1500.00 for it and would sale it for 1500.00 you move it once its yours. Times are hard now a days so i would do some trading on it also. Im looking for good semi auto pistols. heres a few i have in mind let me know what ya got. I will also take rifles as well. Let me know what ya got and what kind of deal your looking for. Not sure why the two bottom pic are not right side up i will try to fix them Thanks.

The patented SERPA lock engages the trigger guard as you holster the pistol and won’t let go until you release it. The release is made using your normal drawing motion, with the trigger finger beside the holster body. As your trigger finger naturally comes to rest on the SERPA lock’s release mechanism, simply push the mechanism as you draw the weapon and it releases the gun for a smooth, fast draw. No awkward use of a middle finger release or thumb break to interfere with a full combat grip, the SERPA lock lets you draw the weapon quickly while establishing a full grip from start to finish. Unlike thumb breaks, which can sometimes be difficult to fasten one-handed, the SERPA lock allows you to re-holster quickly and securely every time, using only one hand. The SERPA holster has the same speed cut and concealment enhancing design of our Standard Model Carbon Fiber Holster. All BlackHawk® CQC™ SERPA holsters come with both belt loop and paddle platforms."

I also have some P-MAG 30 round magazines, so if you want those make me an offer."

Takes 3 inch shells. Awesome small varmit gun! Great for beginer rabbit hunters. The finsish is scratched up some from hunting but it is in the finish and can be fixed easily. Still because of this it looks rough. I want to trade only. I will not repspond to cash offers and I am not in a hurry to get rid of this gun. Just looking for a new hunting gun or toy.

I also have what I believe to be a Hopkins and Allen 12 gauge single barrel I would part with in trade with it for the right firearm.

I'm not traveling out of Springfield. Ive had too many of you people not show up or not bring what you said you would to justify wasting my gas and time anymore. Thank you."

I'm putting in a dealer order WEDNESDAY.  I can order and my distributor has IN STOCK:

Ruger 10/22 .22lr 25rd Steel Lips Banana Mags, clear and new in packaging by Butler Creek for $29/each.
Ruger 10/22 25rd Clear Hot (read: red) Lips Mags new in packaging by Butler Creek for $23/each.

SKS 10 round detachable mag's metal for $25/each.

CMMG 22lr 25 round mags for $24/each.
Colt 22lr 25 round factory mags for $37/each.

AK47 7.62x39 48 round Thermold mag's for $20/each (love these mags, use them myself).

GSG 22lr 2-pack's, factory mags $65/pair.

These are all your cost picked up directly from me in the Florence, KY area.  I can meet within a reasonable distance.  I do NOT have a store front, I'm just an FFL holder trying to help others get the mags I have access to without being price gouged.

I can NOT get any metal AK 47/74 mags or any AR mags, unfortunately.  From what I read, PMAG's have a backorder of something like 4 million.  Backorders may take up to a year.

Order goes in WEDNESDAY 9am, please email me with what you'd like and I'll put the order in.  You don't pay until you pick up your items.  I'm in NKY.  Willing to ship, but buyer will need to pay via Paypal and then pay cost of shipping (obviously that will make sense to buy in bulk or with a group of people).  If you don't pickup within a week, I'll list them for sale on here at these prices.  Again, just trying to help people get what I have access to, but don't need.  I'll confirm with you by email that I've received your request and advise you when your order comes in.  My distributor advised me that LARGE orders like this can take up to 2 weeks to ship, but they're usually pretty good about sending sooner."

I'm putting in a dealer order WEDNESDAY. I can order and my distributor has IN STOCK:

Ruger 10/22 .22lr 25rd Steel Lips Banana Mags, clear and new in packaging by Butler Creek for $29/each.
Ruger 10/22 25rd Clear Hot (read: red) Lips Mags new in packaging by Butler Creek for $23/each.
Ruger 10/22 22lr 10rd Blued Mag Factory New $20/each.

75 round Asian metal SKS 7.62x39 drums for $165.
SKS 10 round detachable mag's metal for $25/each.

CMMG 22lr 25 round mags for $24/each.
Colt 22lr 25 round factory mags for $37/each.

AK47 7.62x39 40 round clear smoke mag's (Bulgarian) for $23/each
AK47 7.62x39 40 round metal lined polymer mag's (bulgarian) for $28/each.
AK47 7.62x39 48 round Thermold mag's for $20/each (love these mags, use them myself).

GSG 22lr 2-pack's, factory mags $65/pair.

These are all your cost picked up directly from me in the Florence or Covington, KY area. I can meet within a reasonable distance. I do NOT have a store front, I'm just an FFL holder trying to help others get the mags I have access to without being price gouged.

I can NOT get any metal AK 47/74 mags or any AR mags, unfortunately. From what I read, PMAG's have a backorder of something like 4 million. Backorders may take up to a year.  Most AR manufacturers websites are listing 8-12 months for complete AR backorders to be filled.

Order goes in WEDNESDAY at 9am on the dot, please email me with what you'd like and I'll put the order in. You don't pay until you pick up your items. I'm in NKY. Willing to ship, but buyer will need to pay via Paypal and then pay cost of shipping (obviously that will make sense to buy in bulk or with a group of people). If you don't pickup within a week, I'll list them for sale on here at these prices. Again, just trying to help people get what I have access to, but don't need. I'll confirm with you by email that I've received your request and advise you when your order comes in. My distributor advised me that LARGE orders like this can take up to 2 weeks to ship, but they're usually pretty good about sending sooner."

This rifle was built using a near new AKM kit and a Krinks receiver by our company, Ironwood Mfg. We are a class 2 firearms mfg. & have been in business in Tucson for 14 years.
This rifle is unique in that it has all the original Romanian trigger parts, which we believe are far superior to some of the US made parts most imported AK come with. The trigger has been re worked to produce a short, smooth stroke with a light 4# pull. The bore is excellent, bright & shinny.    
The durable finish is Brownells baked on Teflon/Molly coat.
The gun has been test fired only and functioned flawlessly. It has a threaded Tapco muzzle brake & US made soft pistol grip. The wood is very good with no noticeable dings & no cracks. 
Because it does not have US made internal parts the gun does require a magazine with at least 1 US made part, (floor plate, spring, or follower.). It comes with 2- 922r compliant mags and a universal follower,($3 fromTapco), you can put in your fav. magazine to comply."

-STOCK PICTURE-

""Centurion Arms introduces a set of new “diopter” style iron sights for use with AR-15 or M4 flat top receivers. The new sights are designed to the correct ergonomic height for the standard AR-15/M4 flat top receivers for the proper feel and rapid sight acquisition.
The rear drum has four different apertures, allowing the shooter to rapidly adjust for different light conditions. It uses a standard HK type adjustment tool for windage and elevation. The front sight mounts to any commonly available same plane rail style hand guard (LMT MRP, La Rue, Knight’s free float rails, Daniel Defense, Samson, Troy Ind. and Yankee Hill Machine to name a few.) It uses a standard fixed blade which can be replaced with the tritium front sight blade commonly sold for the HK91/94/93/ and MP5’s.
Both front and rear sights are also compatible with any standard AR-15/M4 sights, including any standard height back up iron sights or the detachable carry handle rear sights. This offers the shooter maximum sight options. The new Centurion Arms sights also take up a minimal amount of rail space leaving plenty of room to be used as back up iron sights in conjunction with Aimpoint, EOTech and most other readily available red dot sights."""

I'll list at the bottom what i'm looking for. Here are the specs for my gun:

My Gun:
- Condition: 80-85% (some bluing has been worn off a bit and there are some scratches on the side - I got it on trade this way, but have taken great care of it since)
- Function: It functions perfectly - I've fired 30-40 shells through it and it is a great gun. I hate to get rid of it in fact, but I want to trade towards something else.
- What it comes with: Tube Plug for hunting, I can include several shotgun shells (i'll have to look for an exact count on how many I can include) and the gun.

I don't really have a cash price as i'm looking to trade towards one of the guns I want - But i'd probably take $275 for it. If you are interested in buying it hit me up. I could meet anywhere between the Berea Area to Lexington Area for this trade.

Have a trade offer - Hit me up, i'm happy to try to work something out.

* I can also supply pictures of the gun - I'm just not with it right now, I'll take some later."

Own this gun without paying the taxes or the other fees associated with transferring a gun from one person to another.  If Obama gets his way this week, private, person to person sales of this gun will be illegal. academy sells extra magazines for this gun for $25.
The third picture is of the rear sight.  It is fully adjustable.  Up, down, left, right.  Looking through it you can see right under the top rail, so even if something is mounted on the top you will be able to use that sight.

This gun has the hard to find handle on the top with the accessory rail on top of that.  (not from academy)

We gift these to clients after our term with them is through. These are extras and were saved until last as the best of this year's lot. 

They are individually crafted by a wood artisian and each is unique.

Various woods (cedar / hickory / maple / walnut) lengths and carvings. Most have the ""Wood Spirit"" carving but I have one ""Big Foot"" hickory unit left too. That one wasn't photographed. It's a slight, but definite variant of the Wood Spirit face.

Priced $35 to $60 each, and I cannot guarantee any individual unit is still available. I will bring at least five (5) on any meet to show. All are superb.

On the rifle
Rifling is sharp and bore is bright, all matching numbers, finish in excellent shape with the exception of a small spot on the bayonet, and the rear sight leaf. Night sights still work a tiny bit.

3 ammo pouches, allowing you to carry 180 rounds, or 240 if you can squeeze 4 loaded stripper clips in each pouch. I managed to do it with the very light leather pouch.

Buttstock cleaning kit, Yugoslavian

Bayonet still mounted, along with funky spigot launcher an the cleaning rod

Oil banjo

39 stripper clips

Some free cosmoline.


Pictures available upon request and please ask for pictures before you buy. Out of state buyers will cover all shipping.

Accessories will not be sold independently unless the rifle is sold first. This prevents a headache.

This is an excellent package rifle on a budget.

Minor wear is okay in my book (I just don't want a beat up and neglected gun), it has to function perfectly.

- Mossberg 500 20 Gauge (this one: http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/46366), included will be shells, plug for hunting, etc. (80-85% shape....some bluing has been wore off and there are some scratches - i took it in on trade. It functions perfectly and it a great shooter!)
- I also have a Ruger 10/22 BARREL (stainless, fluted - really accurate and in good shape)
(I would potentially sell the Mossberg for $275 and the barrel for $60)
