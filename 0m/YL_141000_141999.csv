It's been converted using a G2 single-hook FCG, Tromix trigger guard, and nylon hole plugs. Has a matching Tapco SAW grip and 6-position collapsable M4-style stock in tan (they call it FDE, but that's a steaming load). Has a UTG quad rail forend, which is heavy but rock solid. Also included are the original factory 5rd. box mag, a single MD-20 drum with clear cover, 5rds. of slug and 150rds. of bird in an ammo can, and a two-point QD sling with HK clips. Also, it has a YHM Phantom bracher brake threaded on the original muzzle threads, and I will also include the original thread protector if you want to take it off.

The gun has had 25rds. of walmart slug, 100rds. of #7.5 bird, and 25rds. of Sellier&Bellot 12-pellet buck through it, all functioned fine. The S&B shells are too long for the drum, so I sold the rest away long ago, be aware that roll-crimped ammo will only fit in the box magaqzine.

I value the gun at about $1200-1500, and I'm looking to trade for a nice pistol or bullpup. All bullpups that I am aware of are similar in value and very interesting to me - PS90, FS2000, RFB, MSAR...Pistol-wise I'm looking for a FiveseveN, HK pistols (Particularly the USP in .45 or P7 and P9S models, but am interested in anything HK), or a Desert Eagle just for shits and giggles. I'll consider anything that's close in value, but I've decided that I want to basically collect ""fun-gun"" pistols and bullpups only, so that's where my focus is shifting. Will also take trade plus cash for lesser-valued guns.

I will only trade FTF in WA state, don't want to bother with shipping as none of my nearby shops are willing to accept transfers. I live in Bremerton and am willing to travel several hours if necessary to meet."

I've loved this rifle every time i've shot it, hate to see it go but would like to try something different.
All Century Arms CETME rifles are a roller lock, delay blow back, design with fluted chambers for reliable functioning and are built using a cast, 17-4 stainless steel receiver. This receiver is produced using vacuum cast technology. Each casting is hot straightened and heat treated to 42-47 RC. The rifle is finished with a baked on gray/black paint just like the H&K process.
At this time I'm not looking to trade. No LOW BALLERS, please don't waste each others time we know its worth every penny.

This was not a trade in, and is in great shape. The only thing I noticed is some finish has rubbed off the top of the rear sight due to carry. The pistol has a low round count, and has been 100% reliable. You will be hard pressed to find a better carry package, as the holsters and light make this a very versatile setup.

The upper, lower and charging handle are NP3 coated. The MRR rail is black anodized. Everything is new, but the upper is a POF blemished upper. It looks like new, except for a few very light streaks on the back side (see picture). These are NOT scratches, only very faint imperfections in the finish. 

This stuff retails for:

POF Lower - $500

POF Upper with MRR Rail - $850

POF Charging Handle - $50

POF Ambidextrous Bolt release - $60

Everything together cost approximately $1460. I'm selling it all for $900.00. There is a reason why these rifles sell for 3000.00, their stuff is top quality.

Comes with the Ruger soft case, Troy rail covers, a magpul RVG(railed vertical grip), and an M16 bandoleer repack kit as extras. I bought this from a friend, and he kept the magpul Pmags, so I do not have them here to include. If the 3 mags are a deal breaker, I will throw in 3 of my own to close the deal.

This is a good price, these rifles are getting harder and harder to find period, let alone for under $1500. I payed alot more than what I'm asking, and all I've done is put about 20 rds through it to test function.

Really just looking for cash to fund a custom AR build. I might be interested in a trade on an Arsenal AK, or a really nice BCM middy AR15. 


DO NOT REPLY IF YOU HAVE NO INTENTION OF BUYING THIS RIFLE. I am sick of reposting this ad because people don't actually have the cash, or think I'm gonna be interested in trading for something worth a third as much at the last minute. Serious inquiries only, please."

NIB Springfield Stainless Milspec - NM Serial

If you've ever looked for one, you know these aren't the easiest Springfields to find. I searched high and low and finally found a stainless NM Serial Milspec, and this one came together RIGHT. Fit and finish are absolutely flawless in every way, and the trigger is the best non-custom 1911 trigger I have ever felt that has come right out of the box. This is an incredible example of the NM Milspec - They only come together like this one every so often.

I bought this as a gift, and it is unfired outside of the factory. I have decided to go in a different direction. 

The price is ABSOLUTELY firm - $600 + actual shipping. I will do a FTF in the Toledo area AT AN FFL ONLY (you pay the transfer).

Thanks for looking.

It's Model 395KB - 12 ga - c-lect choke. #832627. Uses either 2 3/4 or 3 inch shells.  Original owner.

Has some rust issues and also the rear sight was sawed down a little (to make it more 'vent-rib-look-alike') only to realize that it should not have been.  

Replaced sawed down rear sight portion with a 'home brew' taped on piece of metal with a ""V-notch"" cut into it (to get the point of impact in line with the aimpoint).  

So she's not too pretty to look at but she'll 'get the job done'!

Has a detachable (box-like) magazine which goes through the stock and holds 2 rounds.

Great gun for a beginning Deer or Dove hunter.  

Also great as a backup gun that you're not too worried about as far as how it looks.  

Could also easily remove the firing pin to make it a ""scary-looking-but-can't-shoot-it"" 'bluff type display' - to maybe scare off trespassing intruders with - should that ever be needed.

New 20"" cylinder bore barrel, new 7 shot mag tube, new magtube spring and follower too. Less than 100 rounds down the new tubes.

Here's the cool part about this gun - I chemically stripped the aluminum reciever down to bare metal and began sanding. 600 grit, 1000 grit, 1500 grit, and finally 2000 grit wet/dry paper.
2 hours on the buffing wheel and this thing is clean enough to shave it.
I applied two coats of ""Flitz"" metal polish on it, but I wouldn't recommend hunting with this one.
The reflection of the receiver would scare every 4 legged animal for two counties! Two legged critters/zombies would probably stand still thinking to themselves ""Whats that shiny thing over there""- making it an easier shot if necessary.

Recently found out my wife is pregnant, so my priorities have changed a little..

First up, I have three motorcycle batteries that are brand new, never been hooked up.  I have one Z7S battery (the same size as a 5L, but with more cranking power).  These sell in the shops for $75.  I also have two Z14S batteries (same size as 12A-BS, also with more cranking power) that sells for $90.  These were purchased this April for motorcycle projects I was working on.  All the bikes but one are gone now.

Second - I have a fairly generic lawnmower battery (Group U1).  Puts out 225 CCA or so.  They sell for $30.  Thought I had a battery problem, turned out to be the starter.

Third - I have several sealed lead deep cycle batteries.  I have 2 12v, 55AH batteries (Normally $145/ea) and one 12v, 100AH battery (Normally $280/ea).  I bought these for an off-grid solar setup, but when the guy came to set everything up, we concluded that I wouldn't get enough sun to make it worthwhile.  Wind is also out due to the trees.  They've mostly been sitting charging.

I am firm on the price because I spent a lot more on all this stuff. If you would like to trade something email me some pictures. If it’s something worth more than mine than I could add cash. No .22 rifles or shotguns please. I like stuff like the ar-15 and ak 47 but nothing that is over $500.

Has all matching numbers except the aftermarket scope mount that replaces the original dust cover which I don't have.

The SKS is a great gun that shoots ammo that I've bought for as cheap as $0.25 a round! Comes with everything you see in the pictures, including a Simmons 4x28 scope with Leapers mount, and additional NcStar Tri-mount, a NcStar shell deflector (to use with longer scopes), the original 10-rnd mag, a cleaning kit that has everything but the brush, and the sling. You can have the 30-rnd mag as well but its internal plastic bullet pusher piece broke so probably will be of no use.

im selling my shotgun or trading for another rifle (prefer to sell)

this shotgun has 65-70% blueing was gonna re blue it but i dont have the time to do it. it has a bead sight and the barrel is short (it has the bead sight but originally had heat shield with ghost sights but was sold) the gun is chambered at 12 gauge and has a magezine tube that holds five plus one in the chamber. it has a pistol grip and adjustable tactical stock. i had a friend who knows alot about guns check the bore and he said its good shape. gun fires smoothly for a shotgun( to me lol) i only shot it three times and put maybe 100 shells through it and i cleaned it always so yeah.
i bought it from a cop so no worries and i do have a valid foid just fyi.
the reason for selling this shotgun is beacause i just got into surplus rifles i recently bought a yugo 24/47 mauser and its in really good shape with matching serial numbers so im kinda getting into surplus rifles
but if trade for the shotgun i prefer a semi auto from a cool looking .22 caliber all the way to a surplus rifle like a sks or other. so if you want to contact me i dont use my email much call my number at REDACTED
only serious  deals please and thank you"

First Of All If You Look At The ""Sooner State Pawn Postings"" They Seem To Basically Believe And Claim That Everyone Except Themselves Are Inflating Prices Or Ripping Off People Here On Armslist If They Have The Same Or ""Simular"" Gun For Sale. The ""11-87P"" Posted For $827 Is Another Fine Example Of Arrogant Stupidity And Desperation To Sell A Gun At The Expense Of Accusing Another Seller On Armslist Of Trying To Rip Someone Off. Look At The Posting This Idiot Put Up And You'll See That The Picture He Posted Is Of The ""Older Version 11-87P Model#29849 With Ghost Ring Sights' With The ""Old Style Recoil Pad Minus The Barrel Clamp"" That Commonly Sell For $600 To $800, And Not The Model# 29861 Pictured On The Other Posting He Is Slandering. This Model He Shows Is The Least Desirable Of The Three Models Availiable And That Is Why ""DAVIDSONS"" Still Has Over ""60"" Of Them For Sale If You Want To Pay Over A $1000 For One, And The ""MSRP"" Is $1206.41 On That Model, But At Least It Would Have All The ""New Improved Features"" Over The Old Version He Has Pictured And Come With A ""Lifetime Warrenty"" From Davidsons. If You Go To ""DAVIDSON'S"" You Will See That There Is No Availiability Of The Other ""2"" Most Desirable ""11-87P"" Versions With ""Bead Or Rifle Sights"" To Buy. This Person Is Posting As A ""Private Party"" But In All Reality Is Probably An Associate Or Advocate Dealer Of ""Sooner State Pawn"" In Oklahoma City, Or A ""Scammer"" Using Their Name Trying To Use The Same Tactics To Sell A Gun Probably Picked Up From Some Poor Individual At Less Than Half It's Value That Sacrificed It To Pay Bill's Or Feed Their Family. You Would Think That If The Deals Are So ""Great"" From These Guy's They Would Be Able To Just Post Their ""Guns And Price And Sell Them Quick"", Rather Than Make False Accusations On Other Armslist Member's To Make A Sale, I've Been To ""Sooner State Pawn"" In Oklahoma City, And They ""Did Not"" Have Any ""Remington 11-87P Models In Stock"" But Can Order You One Of Those Availiable With Ghost Sights Model#29849 From ""DAVIDSON'S"", And Frankly Their Prices Are No Better Than Most Other ""Gun And Pawn Dealer's In Oklahoma"" I've Been To. Bottom Line Is That ""This Guy And Sooner State Pawn"" Are Like Shady Used Car Dealer's Apparently Working Together To Make Desperate Sale's By Trying To Make Any Competition Look As Dishonest As They Apparently Are In Order To Make Sales. Hell, If They Were So ""Great And Respectable"" We Would Not Need Armslist Here In Oklahoma, Everyone Could Just Buy, Sell, Or Trade Gun's Through Them And They Could Be Like The ""Obama Administration With ObamaCare"" Looking Out For All Of Us Gun Owner's Best Interest In Their Humble Opinion. Take A Brand New In The Box Gun In There To Sell Them And See How ""Great"" A Fair Price They Offer You For It, And Compare That Price To What They Will Turn Around And Sell The Same Gun To You For. ""Hopefully"" This Post Will Make The Idiots Wake Up And Realise That I'm Not The Only ""Legal Gun Owner/Collector"" That Is Tired Of Seeing The Derogatory Postings Of The Idiots Who Consistantly Use The Un-Professional Tactics Of ""Mine Is Better Than The Other Guy's"" Technique To Sell Their Crap. Especially When Trying To Slander Other Member's Postings Integrity With False Picture's And Statements To Try To Make A Sale. This Should Be A Red Flag To Anyone About These Peoples Character And Honesty Before Buying Anything From Them. It's Apparent That ""Quality Firearms And Fair Prices"" Are Not Good Enough To Sell Their Guns, So They Try To Convince People With The Old ""Trust Me, I'll Not Rip You Off Like The Other Armslist Member's Or Gun Dealer's With Inflated Price's Etc..."" And The Only Way To Stop This Kind Of ""Trash Postings"" Is If Respectable Armslist Member's Consistantly ""FLAG"" The Idiots Until They Get The Message. Anyway, ""Happy Memorial Day To All You Veterans Who Have Served As I Have, Or Are Actively Serving Now, And Lets Not Forget Our Fallen Brother's And Sister's Who Can't Be Here Today"".

Let's See What He Come's Up With Next, And When He Is Done I'll Re-Post His Original Listing I've Made A Copy Of So A Comparison Can Be Made To See Just How Pathetic And Desperate He Is. He Still Needs To Change The Claim That ""Sooner State Pawn"" Has Those Guns In Stock For Less Than $900 In Oklahoma City For Example. ""I Wonder If He Will Just Copy The Other Guy's Posting And Change The Price And Contact Information To Look More Professional And Intellegent, Rather Than Rewriting His Post And Possibly Sending An Apology To The Other Armslist Member For His Stupidity And Lack Of Professionalism. I Only Up-Dated This Post To Let The Idiot Know His Effort's Are Not Going Un-Noticed And Am Just Tired Of This Kind Of Crap Here On Armslist, And It's Time Someone Steps Up And Exposes These Idiots, And Yes, Idiot Is The ""Polite Title"" I'm Using Rather Than A More Accurate One More Commonly Used In The Navy. Just Another Example Of How Far These Idiots Will Go To ""SCAM"" Someone Out Of Their Hard Earned Money.......I Also Just Called ""Sooner State Pawn"" And Asked Them About The Posting And They Claim Not To Be Associated With The Idiot And Don't Have Any ""11-87P's"" In Stock And Can Still Only ""Order One From Davidsons That Are Still Availiable And In Stock"" And It Would Have The Lifetime Gaurantee. They Said They Would Contact The Oklahoma City Posting To Correct His ""Product Information"" Regarding Using Them To Sell His Gun, Even Though I've Seen ""Sooner State Pawn"" Posting's In The Past Here On Armslist Using The Same Tactics And Statements On Other ""Armslist Member's/FFL Dealer's"" In The Past Trying To Drum Up Business Here In Oklahoma. Again, Let's Put A Stop To This Crap, And If The Need To Slander Or Make Accusations Is A Must, Send It To ""Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid And The Rest Of The Anti-Gun Activist Out There"" Who Want To Take Away Your Gun Right's And Tell ""You"" What's In ""Your Best Interest""."

This is a great rifle for plinking or getting a few squirrels for that last minute dinner. The action is smooth and cycles rounds without a problem. The barrel is 24”long with good rifling and a shiny bore what I would rate at a conservative 8++. The bluing is good with a slight patina. All serial numbers are matching including the stock and buttplate. There are some minor handling marks, which I tried to show in the pictures

Overall this is a very good gun which I just used for plinking. If this model 12 is not as described, you may return it in the same condition for full refund of purchase price within 3 days after it is received. Refund given pending inspection of condition after returned. Purchaser pays return shipping. C&R OK. If not need to ship to FFL.

950,http://www.armslist.com/posts/141950,For Trade:  Wicked Lasers Spyder Arctic III 1 Watt blue laser. Burns/Cuts/Melts,"South OK, Oklahoma, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Saturday, May 28, 2011",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This is a brand new Wicked Lasers Spyder III Arctic 1 watt blue laser. Right off the bat, I'll tell you that you can go on to Wicked Laser's website right now and order this very laser for $299.99. However, I won't take anything close to that. The FDA (yes FDA) has put an import ban on any handheld laser above 5mw. This particular laser is 200x more powerful then what current import allows. Actually getting your hands on one of these is VERY diffcult. I'm a GM for UPS and even with my connections in customs, it still took me 6 1/2 months to get a hold of mine. From what I'm told 85% of these are seized.

However, once you DO have one, they are pretty incredible. It will burn or melt most things dark colored. You can cut through plastics, light cigs, pop ballons, start fires, etc. The beam is so powerful that if you pointed it straight up in the air, no only can you see the beam the entire way up, but the only reason it doesn't hit outter space is because our inner atmosphere diffuses the beam. If you were at sea, and pointed the beam straight out infront of you, the only reason you aren't able to see it past a certain point is because of the curvature of the Earth.

I understand this isn't what you typically see, so if you have any questions feel free to ask."

~148k miles, Good tires/brakes, replaced not too long ago. New battery this winter. Power windows, locks seats work. Clean Interior.  rust by the running boards as most of these do. Has towing package. Radio/speakers doesn't work well. Heat works great! A/c needs recharge, haven't done it because i never use it anyways. 4X4 works...but needs a new electric switch to turn it on and off, ($60-$80) Tail gate doesn't open, someone tried to force it open when it was locked, will be trying to fix that before it sells(TAILGATE NOW FIXED). Someone was also kind enough to scratch ""ass whole"" into the rear passenger side panel(noticeable up close and when wet) other scratches in paint as well from over the years.

Overall very dependable car! Used it all winter back and forth to appleton without issues, just looking to buy something different. Would consider trade for Fullsize older pickup. Has to have working heat, drive dependably and decent tires as mine does.
