6 shot .22 Long / long rifle, 5 1/2"" Barrel, Excellent bore. Aout 96% Original Blue Showing virtually no wear with only a few cylinder drag marks and a small holster wear spot at the end of the ejection rod tube. Action works excellent (both single and double action) The serial number puts the gun at about a 1959 manufacture. Very shootable and very accurate. Put some CB caps in this and be real quiet, LOL. Come to me and I will even throw in a hard case.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

 Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

 I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are a effing retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."

It's mil spec forged 7075-T6 with teflon coating.  I've had some folks question it because of the name.  I have two custom rifles built on CD and never had a problem.  If you look around, you'll see there more manufacturers/final finishers than the half dozen or so forges--and while it clearly matters the blueprints the finishers use, not only is this mil spec finish (obviously minus the auto sear pin holes) but it starts with the same raw forging as the ""big name"" finishers.  Anyway, not to be rude, but I've had some lowball offers--if you don't understand the value of the quality (check some of Fortier's writings in Shotgun News or surf AR-15.com) please don't make an insulting offer (so for one guy, no, $90 isn't ""fair to both of us"").

He had it on consignment from the estate of an insurance executive who had recently passed-away. One of the heirs advised him that their father had purchased the gun “several years ago” and kept it in the safe in his home office.

The dealer was under the impression that the Colt had been manufactured in 1933 and was, at one time, in South America.  I bought the gun simply on the basis that I thought it was beautiful.

I took it out and ran it through its paces, finding that it shot very reliably and true to aim, consistently. It particularly liked cheap, Winchester white box fmj ball ammo.  

I conducted some research about its origin. The C168004 serial number indicates that it is one of the 5,320 Hartford Colts that were made in 1933 and issued to the Buenos Aires Police Department, aka a “Policia de la Capital” pistol. This was confirmed by the “No. 1849” stock number stamped on the top of the slide. The “JLD” stamp by the mag release further indicates a South American presence at one time. The unusual thing about the pistol is the absence of any of the Argentine roll marks customarily found on these pistols. 

As you can see from the pictures, condition is excellent. I assume that it was professionally refinished, however the Colt roll-marks look as fresh and sharp as they do on some of my Colt originals. I also assume that the grips are replacements, as they are unblemished and the checkering is still sharp. The gun is mechanically excellent. The two identical magazines are generic aftermarket.

DESCRIPTION:

We started by improving the optical configurations which lowered the F-stop factor and increased optical resolution. By doing this, more light travels through the lens to the tube. More light and better resolution simply means brighter and sharper image. Then we added our precision ""Red on Green"" aiming system, easy push button operation, reticle brightness adjustment and our detachable most powerful in the industry 450 mW Infrared Illuminator with dedicated windage and elevation adjustments. Our  ATN Aries MK 390 Weapon Sight is the best 1st Generation scope on the market.
The ATN Aries MK 390 easily mounts onto any U.S. standard 7/8"" weaver or Picatinny rail.

FEATURES:

Powerful multi-coated all-glass optics

High resolution Gen 1+ Image Intensifier tube

Easy-to-see “Red on green” reticle system

Great quality mags made here in Holland, Michigan!  Would like to get $50 each.

The CAMMENGA MODEL EM3-556 EASYMAG is a heat-treated steel magazine, with tip-proof steel follower, chamfered feed lips, and a stainless steel main spring, which improves upon the reliability and feeding performance expectations for M16 and AR-15 type weapons. Built to last with high-strength 1050 spring-steel finished with a two layer anti-friction coating. The EASYMAG features an open case design that allows for fast loading, unloading, and cleaning. The front half can be unlocked and opened to facilitate rapid loading without the aid of a loading device. The EASYMAG also accepts stripper clips and can be quickly cleaned without disassembly. Also works great with Bump fire!

Heat-Treated 1050 Steel construction is highly resistant to deformation and maintains critical dimensions. This increases the EASYMAG’s service life, feeding performance, and reliability compared to any similar magazine designs. Continuous curve geometry design provides optimal feeding performance and dramatically reduces the likelihood of malfunctions in battlefield environments. Slide-open design allows for rapid loading, unloading, cleaning, maintenance, and inspection without disassembly.
Accepts standard 10 round stripper clips, spoons, and other loading devices.

This is not the typical big box store AR. This AR was custom built by an industry leader. This is your opportunity to own a high quality rifle that will provide you years of excellent service.

Nobody could have predicted the success of Les Baer Custom’s Police Special, the special 16” AR that was designed to include every important feature a police officer wants but none of the stuff he doesn’t. Nobody but Les Baer who knew there was a need for a high performance rifle that could serve as either a patrol carbine or a high energy tactical rifle. For 2012, Les has sweetened the pot even a little more by adding a few additional high demand law enforcement features including a new LBC national match carrier, a six position M-4 style collapsible stock, and a very special LBC flip-up front sight.

As a patrol carbine or a high energy tactical rifle, the Les Baer Police Special is the new class of the law enforcement market. It’s loaded with the thoughtful, businesslike features that make it a serious pro, and it’s intentionally devoid of the amateur gee-gaws that cheapen the purpose and limit the usefulness of a police rifle for real police work.

Features include:
• LBC forged and machined upper and lower receiver • Removable carry handle with rear sight • Picatinny flattop rail on upper • LBC National Match carrier, chromed • Precision bolt and extractor • 16” precision button rifled steel barrel with 1 X 8 twist • LBC flip-up front sight • six position M-4 style collapsible stock­ • Special Picatinny 4-way handguard, free floated • Lockable sling swivel mounted on stud on 4-way handguard • 1” nylon sling • A2 style flash hider • Bead blast blue finish on steel parts • Anodized finish on aluminum parts • Timney Match trigger group • (2) 30-round magazines

This is a great gun. The fit and feel is fantastic. 
The sights take a little to get use to, but I am convinced they are 
superior to the standard dot sights. It shoots well. I've only put a 
couple hundred rounds of Federal FMJ's thru it, but so far no 
FTE's or any other issues. It is a great value. 

The Steyr M-Series pistol is what a handgun should be for the utmost in performance,
safety and reliability. Revolutionary design and safety features, such as the world's first
integrated limited access key-lock safety in a semiautomatic pistol, put the Steyr M-Series
light years ahead of the competition. The unique triangle/trapezoid sights offer a new level
in ease of sighting and rapid target acquisition. This double-action-only pistol features black synthetic grips and 2each 12-round magazines. 
Grips, metal, and bore are all in excellent condition."

This professional Winchester Model 70 controlled feed claw extractor action gives the strength and accuracy of machined chrome-molybedium steel with all the most preferred features.

The anti-bind bolt design helps to insure smooth cartridge loading. The innovative, field strippable bolt assembly is easy to inspect and service without tools. The gun offers precision and durability from the cold hammer-forged rifling (1:12 inch, right hand twist) and the medium heavy fluted barrel is free floating for consistent performance and accuracy. Comes with the factory with a Mil-Std 1913 type machined steel rail, with 20 MOA additional elevation built in, installed for mounting optical sights. All of these features are wrapped in a FN/Hoague synthetic stock with anti-slip texturing on the forearm and the flared bottom pistol grip. SUPER ACCURACY!

Bushmaster Dissipator Carbine AR 15 Rifles 
With four models from which to choose, the Bushmaster Dissipator Carbine AR 15 rifles are specifically configured to disperse hot gases and making shooting easier. With your choice of a Solid Stock or TeleStock, all models have 16” heavy profile barrels and are chrome lined in both chamber and bore for seriously long-lasting reliability. Chambered for the .223 Remington round, these rifles can also handle the powerful and popular 5.56mm NATO cartridge. 


Unlike other carbines, the Bushmaster Dissipator Carbine AR 15 rifles have air vents and internal heat shields on the handguards, which are constructed of a thermoset polymer composite. Seriously accurate and high-performance, even the most discriminating gun buff can appreciate the quality of these Bushmaster AR 15 rifles.

Some of the bikes features include, S&S 113 motor, Baker Transmission, Primo open belt drive. It has a 230mm rear tire and 200mm front (hence the Fatso edition). Bourget uses a signature and patented internally ran oil system, which means it has no oil tank, instead it is ran internally through the frame tubing. You will not find this on another bike.

Well all was fine until my wife discovered I bought the rifles and there's still a hole in the roof where she went thru it.

Needless to say I have sold 4 and this is my last one.  As I stated this is an investment quality rifle and I paid a high price for it.

I realize I will not get what I paid and someone will get an awesome rifle at an awesome price.  I am accepting offers for the rifle.

This is a used rifle and has bluing worn off in spots, so don't expect a safe-queen.

Must be US Citizen, able to legally buy and own a firearm and have a Valid Colorado Driver's License for Bill of Sale.

If you need to pay by credit card, I'm willing to accept payment via paypal, but need to charge an extra $20 to cover the fee."
