I only put that I would trade for the other items because people kept asking if I would trade.

The sight picture on this gun seems to activate your brains ""auto-aim"" feature too.lol Just about every one I have ever let handle it has been amazed at how easy it ease not only to acquire a good sight picture, but with how little muzzle flip it has too.  I have 3 - 10 round magazines for it. Also including 10 Winchester Hollow Points (to keep you and yours safe) and a total of 120 FMJ Winchester and Fiocchi (to get you in some practice with it just in case you ever have to use it). If you are a righty, I can toss in the thigh rig I use for it. If your a lefty, I may have a spare holster too, will have to look for it - I think I have a brand new SpecOps brand holster thats M.O.L.L.E. compatible. I think its a universal and the Steyr will fit it. Either way I'll throw it in. Been a great concealed carry and home defense gun. My kids and wife loved learning on it, but now they are older and have their own ideas about the guns they want. Kids... gotta love 'em :-) Got questions or your ready to buy... call FIVE-EIGHT-ZERO - SEVEN-THREE-SIX - EIGHT-FOUR-NINE-FOUR and ask for Tony."

Full sized duty pistol. Spur Hammer, Parkerized, low profile fixed sights, improved ambidextrous safety levers, with two original parkerized 13 rd magazines, two aftermarket 13 rd, one 15 rd and one 20 rd.
Checkered walnut grips and a pair of wraparound Pacmeyers.
two Leather belt holsters.
Excellent condition mechanically, some nicks and holster wear on original finish. This is a used duty pistol, if you are looking for a brand new pistol with no finish wear, this is not it.
This is the current military and law enforcement configuration, and has a black barrel. This particular gun was made in Belgium in 1985.
Buyer must have a state issued photo ID and sign a sales receipt. No felons, no out of state buyers.
The Browning Hi Power was designed by John M. Browning and he considered it an improvement over his 1911 design. It has been issued to more military forces than any other pistol in history and is still in service today. Many have argued the HP should have been the pistol we replaced the 1911 with, if we insisted on going to 9mm in the US armed forces. Controls and operation will be very familiar to the owner of a 1911 model pistol, although takedown is much simpler.
I'm sorry the Smartphone pictures are not very good, but the gun looks better in person. The glare is from oil and flash. 
$550 or best offer. Will consider trade. This gun is too large and heavy for my wife to carry. A smaller single stack 9mm might work better for her."

I am including a leather holster, 50 hallow points and a Lasermax red laser in addition to the case and two magazines that the gun comes with in the first place.

The mag pouch is actually a one of a kind, I have never made another since mine. Here is a list of parts and more done....

All parts and dehorn done meticulously until fit was perfect and smooth. I would bet my life on this pistol any day of the week.

These pictures are grainy. Closeup looks like its pitting. Gun is immaculate. I've listed as many pictures as this site will allow.  If serious, I can email you more.

As the original owner, i bought this nice 20g to shoot skeet with, thus the extra IC choke that comes with the gun.  Would estimate its condition as 92-95% on the conservative side.  Oil finished wood out of the box.  Have approximately 700 rounds threw it.  Still as tight as a clam. Upgrading to a new Cynergy which is causing me to sell 2 of my guns to justify a $3k purchase.   Blemishes are few and minor.  Encourage local pu which will keep the low ballers from wasting my time.  Its a nice gun, period.

Price does not include S&H.  Will ship direct to your FFL (unless you live in OH or neighboring states)and you pay actual costs. No California sales.  Must be at least 18 years old with a valid drivers license.

PS. I'll throw in the original wood furniture and 250Rds

This gun has been a joy to tinker with, however I was so busy working on getting it in shape that I have never even had the privilege of chambering a round, it's only signs of use is literally the safety (which should be disengaged when stripping the gun) This baby is literally NEW. 

I will entertain trades: Handguns and other rifles (possibly with cash flow in either direction) Feel free to ask, The worst I can do is say no.

Our veteran instructors are experienced criminal justice professionals.  As a student in one of our North Carolina Concealed Carry-Handgun (CCH) Courses, you will hear the legal issues explained to you like never before.  We use actual case-law examples to show not just how the laws are written, but the spirit of the law, how they have been interpreted, and how jurors may view a case.

Sadly, the majority of law-abiding citizens who have been prosecuted for killing an assailant may not have been charged had they understood the laws.  While acting in ""self-defense"" many CCH Permit holders have been convicted because their actions were based on incorrect information about the laws.  Don't take chances.  Insist on learning the laws from those who know it best.

The Stinger DS LED is the Streamlight rechargeable flashlight with fully independent dual switchs (DS) and now with C4 LED Technology. 

Streamlight is able to triple the brightness of an LED with technology known as C4. The StingerDS C4 LED Flashlight has an intense, long-reaching bright beam that pierces the darkness. The brighter C4 Power LEDs are made possible by a combination of a new diode chip and Streamlight's innovative use of reflectors to magnify, direct, and intensify the light beam. 

Streamlight introduces C4 LED Technology. With a brighter, more powerful, blinding light than any LED thatâs come before. The Streamlight-engineered reflector with C4 Photonic Crystal technology almost triples the brightness and creates an intense beam that pierces the darkness. So you get the long-run times and indestructibility of an LED with a new level of brightness that leaves other LEDs in the dark. Since the StingerDS LED Flashlight is equipped with powerful C4 LEDs, they are the perfect solution for a wide range of professional tasks that require extreme brightness, while benefiting from exceptionally long run times. The enhanced LEDS are made possible by a new development in laser chip manufacturing called Controlled Collapse Chip Connection or ""C4"". Because no two LEDs are precisely alike, Streamlight has carefully selected only LED suppliers that incorporate world-class technology in order to consistently produce 'prime cut' power LEDS for our StingerDS LED flashlight. This means that our customers can be assured that the Streamlight StingerDS LED flashlight with C4 LEDs are consistently bright, with improved light output efficiency. 


DUAL SWITCH TECHNOLOGY â Access any of the three variable lighting modes and strobe via the tail cap or the head-mounted switch.

This gun is custom built from the polished and hand-fitted internals to the stippled front strap and the machined finger groove relief for high hand-hold below the trigger guard. When I got the gun in Texas I was told that a gunsmith at WIld West Customs built the gun for his personal carry weapon, and seeing the high level of detail and meticulous workmanship that went into it, I believe them and have since enjoyed the gun. No other small frame 1911 will feel this good in your hand, I guarantee it.  

The gun is not for sale. I want to trade it only. I'll keep it unless I find something that I would enjoy more. I would prefer to have a full sized 1911 over anything else, stainless a plus. Please only offer handguns. high end revolvers will be considered and other nice autos. I'm looking for a straight trade but can take or add cash if your gun intrigues me."

You'll be getting 3 35 round magazines and a Galil/Golani-specific cleaning kit along with this very enjoyable firearm. I'm sad to see it go, but it's yours for $800.

From the manufacturer:

""The Golani is light weight, air cooled, gas operated, magazine fed
shoulder fired firearm. Ease of operation is a notable characteristic as the upward
pointing knob on the cocking lever, the positioning of the safety lever and magazine
release allows ambidextrous operation. No tools are required to field strip this rifle. The
safety lever, when in the SAFE position, blocks the trigger from moving and covers the
slot in the receiver in which the cocking lever travels, thereby preventing not only cocking
the rifle but also preventing dirt and debris from entering the action which could result in
a stoppage. The convenient folding stock allows operation in tight areas and also allows
the rifle to fold into a compact package for easier storage. With a twist rate of 1-9â the
rifle should readily handle both the 55 and 63 grain 5.56mm ball ammunition.""

""Caliber: 5.56mm; Type of Firearm: semi-automatic rifle; Barrel: 16.25"";
Rate of Twist: 1 turn in 9â; Overall Length: 29"" (with stock folded), 38â (with stock
extended); Weight: 8.13 lbs.; Magazine capacity: 35-rounds; Sights: Rear, twin aperture
flip-type peep with protective wings, Front, dual post with protective ring; front sight
adjustable for elevation with an accessory sight tool, windage adjustments are made with
the screws at the front sightâs base; Sling attachment points at left sides of gas tube &
receiver; Folding stock locks into extended position via a spring-loaded mechanism."""

I recently purchased a new Sig P938, and I figured Iâd see if anyone is interested in a good P238. Iâve carried it everyday for the past half year, so it has some minor wear on the slide and some cycling scuffs on the barrel, but looks like new otherwise. Iâve fired mostly Remington UMC FMJs, along with some Federal, PMC and Fiocchi. Iâve had 3 FTEs out of about 400 FMJ rounds (UMCs) which I attributed to ammo and poor grip. This 238 is more picky in regards to JHP, but it likes Speer Gold Dots. 

It does not have the ambi-safety. The serial number has the 27A prefix and is a current generation model that does not share any of the flaws surrounding early models.  

$650 in cash will give you a nice Custom Shop P238 ready to carry. I will happily keep this as a back-up if I cannot receive my full asking price.

Buyer must possess valid CHP and sign a bill of sale (buyer will be provided a copy).

Selling because I can't seem to hit the broadside of a barn with it no matter what chokes I use. Comes with 5 chokes- Cyl, IC, M, IM, F. And the box.
I am wanting $400 because it has $50 worth of accessories on it, including a green Truglo Longbead and a Limbsaver recoil pad made for Yildiz.
It's had about 150 rounds through it, still isn't broken in yet. The action has been lubricated a couple times with Breakfree CLP and works a lot smoother than it did out of the box.
This is a good deal because the Limbsaver is so much better than the crappy factory pad (recoil is very minimal with the aftermarket pad), Truglo bead can be seen in low-light conditions, and it's almost broken in.
Hopefully someone will be able to hit with it better than I can."

Iâve been debating selling this for awhile, so buy it before I change my mind. I bought it new a year ago, and itâs been nothing short of a pleasure to shoot. I do not shoot it much though as I focus on 9mm and .22 LR handguns. Iâve found I donât need a .45 no matter how much I like the round. 

Iâve only tried ball rounds, and the Federal 230s work great. No issues with those after the very first magazine.

I'm sure I got gouged but its expected when that's the only available one. Will sell for 600 no less. 

Have a trade worked out but I'm looking for a beretta storm cx4, the carbine. Prefer in 9mm

Will only sell to oklahoma resident who is not a felon. Thanks
I am in tulsa, so will meet in tulsa"
