In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

Caliber: 9mm
Capacity: 19+1
Magazines: 3 magazines for a limited time
Barrel: 5.25"" match grade select fit steel, melonite, fully supported ramp
Sights: red fiber optic front (replacement red & green filament incuded) and fully adjustable target rear.

Frame: Black polymer
Slide: Forged steel with lightening cut
Length: 8.3""
Height: 5.75""
Weight w/ empty mag: 29oz
(M)odel Contour Frame

The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XDM, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.

(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations

Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.

(M)ega-Lock Texture
The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XDM isn't about cosmetics, it's about function.
The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

(M)elonite
Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance.
The rugged Melonite® finish on the XDM is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

(M)atch Grade Barrel

Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XDM match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

(M)inimal Reset Trigger
The new XDM trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

The Standards

In 2001, Springfield Armory® set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features.
With the introduction of the XD® polymer pistol, they did just that….

Loaded Chamber Indicator

The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.
Striker Status Indicator

The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position.

Grip Safety

Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

USA Trigger System™

The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.

This is the model with carry handle (not removable).  I'm not crazy about the all the plastic on the Mossberg, and in the interest of full disclosure, the 25 round magazine is horrible, i can only get about 15 rounds in it max.

(M)odel Contour Frame

The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XDM, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.

(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations

Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.

(M)ega-Lock Texture
The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XDM isn't about cosmetics, it's about function.
The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

(M)elonite
Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance.
The rugged Melonite® finish on the XDM is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

(M)atch Grade Barrel

Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XDM match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

(M)inimal Reset Trigger
The new XDM trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

The Standards

In 2001, Springfield Armory® set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features.
With the introduction of the XD® polymer pistol, they did just that….

Loaded Chamber Indicator

The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.
Striker Status Indicator

The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position.

Grip Safety

Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

USA Trigger System™

The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.

Weight w/ empty mag:

(M)odel Contour Frame

The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XDM, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.

(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations

Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.

(M)ega-Lock Texture
The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XDM isn't about cosmetics, it's about function.
The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

(M)elonite
Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance.
The rugged Melonite® finish on the XDM is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

(M)atch Grade Barrel

Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XDM match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

(M)inimal Reset Trigger
The new XDM trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

The Standards

In 2001, Springfield Armory® set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features.
With the introduction of the XD® polymer pistol, they did just that….

Loaded Chamber Indicator

The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.
Striker Status Indicator

The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position.

Grip Safety

Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

USA Trigger System™

The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.

I don't need to get rid of it, just seeing what's out there for trade. I'm not retarded enough to think this is worth $1200 like some, but at the same point, I'm not giving it away either. Do your research and propose a fair offer and ill get back with you. I live west of middletown, and I work north of Dayton, by huber heights, so I can meet anywhere in between, ill even go as far south as Hamilton, west Chester.

ok, im going to be a little more specific as to what fair offer means, i think i could reasonably sell this rifle for around $800. so when i say propose a reasonable offer, that means propose something of similar value, i won't trade this ar for something i can go onto ebay and buy for $200-$300. also im not going to trade it for a $400 pistol. PLEASE don't waste your time trying to get me to trade for your taurus or 380, again, i know the value im looking to get and if it's not there, i can hold onto the ar. if i dont get back with you, sorry, but i have gotten 14,000 offers and havent had time to reply yet, or im not interested.Thanks."

By completing this class you will then be eligible to apply for your Kansas Carry Conceal License through the Attorney General's office.

The class covers CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Self Defense, and Interaction with Law Enforcement. 

There is a written exam along with a shooting test. You don't need to worry about either test as I give you everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour course. 

I have no minimums on my classes and will NOT cancel them because I don't have enough people for the class. One person is all it takes.

You can bring your own pistol for the shooting portion along with 50 rounds of ammunition. I recommend using a .22 however any caliber is accepted. If you don't have a pistol yet or would just like to borrow mine I have a .22 Ruger.

There is a written exam along with a shooting test. You don't need to worry about either test as I give you everything you will need to pass them both during the 8 hour course.

$ Discount $: If you have attended any of our other courses, we’ll take an additional ten dollars off the price of this course.

The Personal Protection In the Home course teaches defensive / tactical shooting skills which cannot be taught on a typical ""box"" range. 

This intermediate level course enables experienced shooters to move to cover, shoot from behind barricades, develop and employ advanced Flash-Sight-Picture skills, and much more. 

We cover mindset, legal issues, decision-making under pressure, and planning for the worst. 

This course is designed around the use of the defensive pistol where standard marksmanship skills will not work, and will better enable you to survive a felonious attack.

Topical areas include:

1. Defensive Shooting / Rapid Engagement

2. Defensive Handgun Skills

3. Firearms and the Law: Possession, Ownership, and the Use of Deadly Force

4. Strategies for Home Safety and Responding to a Violent Confrontation

5. Selecting a Handgun for Personal Defense

6. Three hours of Range Shooting

7. Course Review and Examination

Students will receive the NRA Guide to the Basics of Personal Protection in the Home handbook and intensive lessons on basics of defensive shooting, issues of self-defense, and other strategies for protecting the home and family.

Students will receive feedback on their shooting exercises, and a National Rifle Association (NRA) certificate upon successful completion of this course. Not only are shooting standards fired during the practical exercises, but a written exam will be given at the end of the course. Throughout the course an individual checklist may be used to ensure the satisfactory absorption of the material being taught.

Our next PPITH Course is scheduled for September 29th, 2012. Don't wait, sign up now!

The Following Info I have gotten from folks who are supposed to be experts
The arm really is a Model 1884! ""Model 1888"", while it had SOME contemporary usage is MOSTLY a term of modern collector convenience, to indicate the final version of the rod-bayonet.
Now, there WERE 100 rifles (noted as having a ""positive cam"") actually marked ""U.S. Model 1888"" but they were experimental only - having a modification to the locking mechanism - they occur in the 4155xx range, and must not be confused with the normal rod-bayonet rifles, of which over 60,000 were produced.

I will take all firearms related trade offers but don't expect full retail for your gun and the cash price on mine. Find a G29SF and add all this up and you're still getting a great deal. If the whole package isn't what you want no problem, G29's are still available nib everywhere. They run about $625 Buy it Now on gunbroker once you add shipping, insurance, and FFL fees. Then you can run out and buy some 10mm at $35.00 a box and just buy all the other goodies later-but you don't have to let me know about it. 

If you made it this far, hopefully you have a sense of humor and know what kind of responses you get from armslist, and understand my frustration....
