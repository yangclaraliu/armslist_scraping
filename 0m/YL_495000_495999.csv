Metal has a nice patina on it.  Has normal wear that one would expect an 120 year rifle to have.  But nothing major.  The wood is really nice, most likely refinished, but who ever did it did a good good.  Definitely a linseed oil finish.  Action is still smooth and the lock-up is tight.  Octagon barrel, and the hammer has the more desired widow's peak checkering on it.  Bore is dark, but not pitted.  The rifling is still strong.  I'm sure this rifle could tell some stories!

The empty shell case is from 3/16/12.

I bought it new unfired. I have put no more than 100 round through it and it shoots great. I have just decided to move to a G19.

The 30 comes with everything you get when you buy new plus 2 installed Pierce magazine floor plates, the original Glock floor plates, a Pierce grip plug, and a Foxx IWB RH tuckable holster. 

The Pierce floor plates do not add any capacity or length, just a similar texture as the rest of the grip for the pinky. The sights are standard white U rear and dot front. The Foxx holster from what I can tell is similar to the crossbreed. The only thing I would mention is that the 30 is not super snug in the holster by itself. When worn no problems at all.

I'm asking $550 for everything.

I would consider a trades for a similarly outfitted Gen4 G26 or 19, or 9mm ammo + cash. 

I will need to see a IDL and a LTC. I am near Knox and work in Michigan City and willing to drive a reasonable distance.

It bears no import markings and still has the original Arabic markings which date the receiver as either 1896 or 1897 (Arabic calendar conversions are never precise) and the marks from its conversion to 8mm Mauser at the Ankara factory in 1933. The stock is the original straight style stock with a minor crack that has been well mended and pinned. The wood is in very good condition. The barrel is good with minor pitting but fairly strong rifling. This is an antique but I have put 20 rounds through it and it worked flawlessly. It also has a comfortable, well kept leather sling.

I'm not driving 400 miles to meet anyone and I'm not selling to lowballers. I've got about $550 into this rig so this could be a good deal for you)

It's a .40 cal semi that's very accurate and in good condition. It was my first gun and I really loved shooting it, but I need the money for a bigger toy. I'm no expert, but even I could get tight grouping with this pistol.
It's extremely easy to disassemble (it takes about 3 seconds) so it's easy to clean.
The gun has awesome Hogue grips.
This pistol comes with 3 magazines. 2 of them hold 11 rounds and 1 of them holds 10 rounds. Everything works great.
Also included:
A shoulder holster that fits the gun and holds 2 magazines. I haven't gotten my CHL yet, so it's never been used.
A holster that goes on your hip and it has a pouch for 1 mag.
Thanks for looking. Email me if you're interested or have questions. May be open to partial trades for 22 lr pistols... Mosquito, Walther p22 or something similar."

This can be shipped, however I am most interested in trades and any sale would be a cash or cash+ transaction. This is something special and needs to come out of my safe and into your display case. You can save the pictures to your computer and they can be enlarged to about 200% for viewing. Forgot to mention Barrel is 2 1/4"" and overall its about 6 1/2"".

FN SCAR-16 in either color.
Benelli M1S90 or M2 (tactical variant)--for a 3-gun build... I'll consider an FN SLP or similar.
Remington 870 Marine Magnum 12GA (for iron-man / heavy metal division)
I might consider something else, but it must be of high-quality and in appropriate condition, and we'll wheel and deal until we're both happy.

Up for trade / partial trade (+/-), or for sale (if you aren't insane with your offer):

S&W Model 31-1 in .32 S&W Long. Very rare, near-mint condition! 400.00 value
I'll toss in two holsters and a partial box of ammo (lead SWC).

Ruger 22/45 threaded barrel model, two mags, zipper bag, original box & Bushnell optic. Only have about 20 rounds through it! 400v

Mossberg 500 12GA slug gun: Seen a long life. Has rifled barrel (sabot slugs), cantilever mount and long eye relief scope, sling, and side saddle. bore looks great... deep rifling... shows typical hunting-related scratches. 350.00v

Draco pistol 7.62x39: Midwest Industries rail, Mepro reflex sight, Echo93 sling mount, hogue grip in tan, Surefire laser module (legacy system--rare!), tango down and magpul rail covers, PWS hybrid brake + flash hider, 40 rd polymer mag and two steel 30 rd mags. Exactly 60 rounds through this weapon. 850.00v

Argentinian Mauser w/bayonet. Typical surplus Mauser condition. 200.00v

Ruger 10/22 custom build. Fajen thumbhole stock, Midway SS bull barrel, BSA benchrest scope, Harris bipod... custom made (by me) 550 cord non-adjustable sling.. polished bolt + receiver... trigger job. This thing is a tack driver. 600.00v

AR pistol in 5.56. Hogan billet receiver (they make POF's), Geiselle SSA trigger, Ergo super-grip, Magpul ASAP, Sionics upper, ASA 7.5"" barrel, Noveske KX3 flaming pig brake, Magpul MBUS, Eotech XPS 2 w/GG&G QD and claymore caps, Spikes nickel boron plated bolt and BCG, Magpul MS2 sling. This thing is incredible. I had plans to make this an SBR... but again... my competitive habit is calling me. Round count: 120. 2000.00v as depicted.

RRA M4-gery. RRA lower, RRA NM trigger, Ergo super-grip in FDE, redi-mag, mil-spec receiver extension, VLTOR imod, SOC rubber butt pad, Stag 1/9 twist M-4 upper w/full-auto cut BCG (no, the gun is not full-auto), Sure-fire M900 weapon light w/white nav lights, ARMS SIR rail (yeah.. the real deal) with built-in BUIS. ACOG + T1 ARE NOT FOR SALE. I ran this rifle through a carbine course, and it worked perfectly when others with more expensive guns had failures. It's been well cared for, and has served me well.... but my SCAR heavy needs a little brother. 1800.00 value (sans optics)

New England Firearms (NEF) .22LR revolver. You know you need a good... 8 shooter. It's double-action only, and comes with an el-cheapo nylon belt holster. 175.00v

Be ready to provide valid AZ driver's license &/or CCW, and we will sign a bill of sale. Be a legal buyer. Don't be shocked if I make attempts to verify your status.

I prefer to trade +/- for the listed items, but cash talks.

I can take paypal, or a credit card via Square App for iPhone (associated with my LLC). Expect to have 3% less bargaining power if you're paying by one of these methods.

If you think you're going to pay me with a check, you'll have to trust me while I sit on the weapon(s) until your check clears.... and that includes something printed at the post office!!!

It's a .40 cal semi that's very accurate and in good condition. It was my first gun and I really loved shooting it, but I need the money for a bigger toy. I'm no expert, but even I could get tight grouping with this pistol.
It's extremely easy to disassemble (it takes about 3 seconds) so it's easy to clean.
The gun has awesome Hogue grips.
This pistol comes with 3 magazines. 2 of them hold 11 rounds and 1 of them holds 10 rounds. Everything works great.
Also included:
A shoulder holster that fits the gun and holds 2 magazines. I haven't gotten my CHL yet, so it's never been used.
A holster that goes on your hip and it has a pouch for 1 mag.
Thanks for looking. Email me if you're interested, have an offer or have questions. Local pickup. As far as trades go, I might be interested in a .22lr pistol plus cash on your end. Make an offer."

Thanks to everyone who responded.  A few of you have told me to give Henry a chance and that they will more likely than not fix the rifle under warranty.  All I will be out is the cost of shipping it back to them.  I'm hoping to hear back from them tomorrow and see what they have to say.  I bought the gun for my sons to shoot, but I'm thinking I will still end up selling it even if Henry will fix it for me.  I have other 22's for them to shoot.  If not, I will go ahead and sell it as is.  I already have multiple offers of a $100.  

I have a Henry lever-action 22 rifle that I bought Monday, 7-30-12 off of some crooked bastard in Parker by the name of Rick Scharnell.  It will feed all but the last 2-3 rounds fine.  The 3rd from last shell tries to jam, and then the last 2 don't want to engage and feed at all.  Seems to me that the main problem is a weak spring in the feed tube rod.  It also has some wear to the feed throat assembly, but it does feed just fine until the last 3 rounds.  I paid $150 for it.  Not sure what it is worth in it's present condtion.  REDACTED.

I do have an email in to Henry Repeating Arms to see if they will do anything about the rifle.  Hoping they will fix it under warranty for just the cost of shipping the rifle to them."

This upper cannot use a magazine due to the .308 cartridge size. The .308 cartridge will not fit through the standard AR-15 magazine well. There is no gas system on this upper, so each round will be manually chambered. Loading the upper is done by feeding one round at a time through the ejection port to be chambered. In the pictures you will see a ten round magazine in the gun (only the upper is for sale); this makes loading easier as well as allowing the bolt to be locked open. The upper has a chrome-moly bull barrel that is still in the white (doesn’t have a finish). I think the barrel was custom ordered from Green Mountain Rifle Barrels. It has 1:13 twist which is good for shooting 140 - 168gr bullets. Along with the custom barrel and barrel extension it also has a custom bolt to make the system work. It has a full float aluminum hand guard. The upper receiver is of the M4 design (flat top) without sights (it will need a scope). I think the upper was made by JP Enterprises. It is a complete upper ready to put on a lower and shoot. This upper was built as a prototype for an AR manufacture I used to work for. I was given this upper as a gift for my work on the project. Think of this upper as a hunting or target upper not CQB upper. I would like to get $450 obo for it or trade for one of the following; Ruger LCP, Glock gen 3 or 4 model 17, 34 or 20, AK-47, or Ruger MkII pistol. If you have any questions please ask. If you need other pictures please let me know.

Hello,

I am parting with one of my grandpas rare classic pistols, a beautiful 22 short Hammerli 200 Olympic match pistol made by Walther. The entire length of the barrel from tip to back, is 11 inches long It is in almost near perfect condition and it is certainly priced to sell!  I had it appraised in 2010 by Cabellas and they advised me it is between Excellent and Perfect condition, between $1150 and $1550. Also I don't remember if this piece was ever fired. It comes with the case in the photo and one magazine only. I do not know anything about the history of this piece as with all my late Grandfathers guns unfortunately, honestly we were shocked he owned such a vast collection of firearms.

Scope – Night Force Optics 3.5-15x50
The U.S. military asked for a scope that is exceptionally fast and applicable to a wide range of targets at various distances. The 3.5-15 x 50 F1 NXS is the answer. The reticle is located in the first focal plane, which has distinct advantages in high-stress situations and when the user might encounter targets from up-close to 1000 yards or more. A first focal plane reticle remains in the same visual proportion to the target across the scope’s entire magnification range, making it especially appropriate with range finding reticles. Combined with Nightforce highly tactile and intuitive adjustments, it makes for a scope that is extremely quick, accurate, responsive and utterly reliable.

For sale is a 2010 Trek Soho Deluxe Bicycle. This bike is the ULTIMATE commuter/ all weather bike. Features a revolutionary gates carbon belt drive, 8 speed nebula hub, fenders, and reflective puncture resistant tires. Bike is a 20 inch model... for people from about 5' 9"" to 6 feet ballpark, but you should get measured at a bike shop. This bike is in great condition with very little use, has a few scratches from being in garage, but for the price is a steal.
This bike retails for 1200 and are very desirable and rarely sold used because people hold onto them and it is a rather new bike to the market.
I am looking for cash mainly, but if you have a trade to offer, I will consider it. Looking for other trek bikes in 20"" or foid items.

Cheaper than dirt description:

Complete upper assembly needed to transform your standard AR into a 50 round, FNH 5.7 powerhouse! Top-mounted magazine, not included, holds 50 rounds to allow for straight-line, lower profile, and no extending magazine to interfere with prone shooting. The clever design ejects spent casings down the magazine well, eliminating flying brass and hot cases going down shirt collars. The upper receiver and rails are precisely milled from a monolithic block of 7075 T6 aircraft aluminum, and will accommodate any style of sighting system. Features an ER Shaw 16"" barrel with flash hider, no gas system to get fouled which makes maintenance a snap!"
