As much as I love this revolver as it is somewhat rare and historically significant, however I've decided that I'd like to trade it for a more modern revolver or semi-auto pistol in which I can buy more available ammo for as I'm more of a shooter than a collector.

I'd be interested in trading for a Ruger or Smith & Wesson revolver OR a quality, name brand semi-auto pistol (such as Springfield XD, CZ Sig, Ruger, Smith, ect) or even an older pistol that is chambered in a common caliber such as a Walther P38, etc...

These were only produced for a short while from 1969-71. 
 This handy little carbine has the factory iron sights, but is drilled & tapped for a scope, & has had sling swivels installed by Marlin as well.
 Condition is around 95%, and has very minor use/storage marks on wood. This is a super clean early example and, of course, far predates the cross-bolt safety on modern Marlin lever guns.
 This will make a nice collector piece, or a great little hog/deer getter.
For any serious potential buyer; I'm happy to answer any questions and send detailed photos,....you will not be disappointed.    Thanks"

I have never worn the holster.  I have tried it on and have left the 27 sitting in a couple of weeks, so it does have a small imprint, but you have to look closely at picture to see.  
I shopped for a while for this holster and I have had a Cross-Breed before and this is a far better holster.  The leather is thinner, therefore more comfortable, and has a much nicer finish.  The Kydex is perfect and it is very adjustable and not nearly as large as others.

The Gen4 Glock 26 is a square chunk of a gun, and is at (or just past) the outer limits of what I consider concealable in a pocket. Loaded it weighs over 26 ounces, and it’s 6.3 inches long. Perhaps just as importantly, it is as wide as its big brother the G17 (1.18 inches), making it rather big-boned for a pocket gun. That said, 10+1 rounds of 9mm in a pistol small enough to hide almost anywhere is one heck of a combination—and the reason the Baby Glocks are so popular. Well, one of the reasons.
Another reason Glocks are so popular is that they are disgustingly, relentlessly, boringly reliable. Pull the trigger, it goes bang. Period."

All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

I am not concerned with the condition of the bluing as I can have it re-blued, but I do need a good looking bore with clean rifling and no rusting/pitting, and an action/trigger that works smoothly.  Please e-mail if you have one for sale, or call me at REDACTED.  Would prefer FTF transfer to eliminate FFL and I will drive to you to do the transaction.  Also hope cash speaks your language.

I am the only owner of both of these girls since they were imported. 

First up the Romanian MDL 1956, besides the first trip to the range and 40 rounds she only comes out to be cleaned, admired and then gently back to safety.  The rifle is all matching, everything.  It is all original, I have never refinished or touched up anything, ever.  The rifle is in immaculate condition and the wood is just lovely.  Whoever fielded this in Romanian took great lengths to keep it in this shape.  Bayonet,mag and all hardware is there and in great shape. My first buy and its time for somebody else to get to admire her.

Now the Yugoslavian 59/66A1, has had closer to 100 rounds thrown down range.  This one is unissued and new, all parts reflect this. Just like the Roma all parts are #'d and matching even the stock. I have taken incredible care of this rifle as I do all my firearms.  She also has the original cleaning kit, Yugo sling and oil bottle.

Each rifle has a nylon case and a railed tapco dark earth kit with foregrip and 2 20round tapco mags in either darkearth or black. As they are now I have the rifles in their original setup for pictures.

Please no felons or out of state silliness. 

I will entertain any and all offers cash or trade but I will be needing some cash out of these rifles ."

Walther PPS is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses modified Browning type locking with tilting barrel. Frame of the gun is made from impact resistant polymer. Trigger is of double action only type, striker fired, with pre-cocked striker system, similar to QA system used in Walther P99 pistols. This system requires a manual recocking (by partial slide retraction) in the case of misfire.

I have a 2004 carter bro gocart with a 750 four honda motorcycle motor on it. 
I cut the old motor off and extended the rearend using 2"" square tubing. 
I painted the frame black. 
The tires still have plenty of tread but 1 of them have a small leak. A bottle of slime would do the trick. 
The bike was said to b a late '70s bike. I have all the wiring exhaust and carbs for this motor. I got the motor runing about a year ago before i took it of the frame all i had to do was clean the carbs and put in new spark plugs. 

The only thing it needs is motor mounts made and welded and a chain. The sprocket will need to b welded to the rearend. 
I do not want to sell this thing but i need the money to fix truck and quad and im tired of seeing it in the back of my garage teasing me because i dont have a welder to finish it. 
I have some metal to finish it.

    skateboard grip-tape on front-strap
    This is a trick I learned from some SWAT guys in a gun shop, as an inexpensive method to get a better gripping surface.  The tape has been on for 3 - 4 years.  Since this has been sitting in the safe, the tape hasn't been worn.  The SWAT guys who actually do this told me that on their guns, they had to replace the grip tape 2 - 3 times a year.   Since it's so inexpensive, cost was not really an issue.  Just make sure to clean the surface thoroughly before replacing the grip tape.

    blue finish  
    The finish on the frame is original from the factory.
    The finish on the slide was re-done by Novak's in 2010, after they cut the dovetail and installed the front sight.


I am the original owner, and purchased this new in October 1999.




It has between 500 - 1,000 rounds through it, but I haven't shot this much (if at all) since around 2002 or 2003. All of the ammo was full-metal-jacket (FMJ), some of Wolf (old style, with the laquer coating). No problems were encountered (at least none that I can recall).

There is holster wear on the edges, the ""idiot mark"" below the slide release lever, and a scratch on the right-side of the slide below the rear-sight. While never my every-day carry (EDC) gun, I did carry this for protection on camping trips.

(waring: profanity in video) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEABZswQWDg


The only modification I would suggest would be to replace the full-length guid rod (FLGR) with a standard guide rod and plug. FLGRs were popular in the 1990s, but don't really add any functional value to a 1911, and make it a bit more difficult to take apart.

If I have time, I'll take some better pictures.
I know I always keep saying that one of these days I'll get a proper setup with studio lighting,
rather than depending on either the crappy lighting inside my house or certain times of day when natural sunlight is favorable.
Or maybe I should just learn to use Photo Shop.

$750



Smith & Wesson 586-4
Product Code 103536
blue finish
6 inch barrel
original box included

I bought this used in 2004, and never shot it. After purchasing this, I obtained a Smith & Wesson 686 with a 4 inch barrel for when I do feel like shooting .357.

According to the Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson, (p. 249), the 586-4 was introduced in 1993, and replaced with the 586-6 in 1997. This is a ""pre-lock"" gun.

586, 1981 Intro
586-1, 1986 Radius stud package, floating hand.
586-2, 1987 Change hammer nose and associated parts.
586-M, 1987 Product warning by S&W, M overstamp to indicate factory (mod for 586 and 586-1)
586-3, 1988 New yoke retention system. 1992 Delete 8 3/8"" barrel and four-position front site. 1992 Delete nickel finish
586-4 1994 Drill and tap, synthetic grips, change rear site and extractor. 1995 Delete square butt. 1997 Delete 8 3/8"" barrel, change to MIM thumb piece.
586-5, 1998 Change design to eliminate cylider stop stud. Change to MIM hammer with floating firing pin, change to MIM trigger, change internal lockworks.


Production of the 586, along with most other blue revolvers by Smith & Wesson, ended around 10 years ago. The Model 686 is the same gun, except made from stainless steel.

NOTE: Smith & Wesson has recently re-introduced the 586, with the lock, as part of their ""Classics"" line of revolvers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ4b27su76M






Like any .357 Magnum revolver, the 586 can also shoot .38 Specials.

A note about the pictures below. When photographing guns, the pictures tend to make the gun either look worse than it really is, or better than it really is, depending on the light; especially off a reflective blue surface, or if the gun is oiled,etc. Specks of dust and fingerprints tend to show up especially well when photographing guns. In some of the photos below, the reflections make it look like the blue finish is worn. I can assure you that it is not, and except for the wear on the front of the cylinder (presumably from being fired by the previous owner), and the turn marks on the cylinder, the finish on this revolver is 95% - 99%. The trigger and hammer appear to be a ""case hardened"" finish. Some of the photographs make it look ""glossier"" than it really is."

 The stock is'nt the normal light or medium color is is very dark brown, I've never seen 1 like this before. Only light to med. walnut.
 It has a couple small nick's in the stock but they are just on the surface so they can be sanded down and the stock re-finished if you want.
 It functions flawlessly for being a very old rifle. 
It is missing the front sight which can be had for a few $'s or you can order fiber-optic 1's for around $30-40.

Details about the ammo Manufacturer:
Military Ballistics Industries (MBI) specializes in custom ammunition and ordinance products for use by the military, law enforcement agencies, and training facilities in the United States.

This remanufactured (reloaded in a factory) product is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, reloadable, and packaged in 100 round, sealed plastic-packs. It is both economical and precision manufactured by an established American cartridge producer. 

Remanufactured ammunition has been around for decades. Some of the world’s best shooters use only remanufactured or custom manufactured ammunition to achieve a level of consistency and optimal ballistics performance that cannot be achieved with mass-manufactured ammunition. Remanufactured ammunition is produced by assembling carefully selected components to include specialty bullets, propellants, primers, and previously spent brass cartridge casings. The bullets, propellant, and primers are always newly manufactured while the brass cartridge casings are typically reprocessed to reduce costs or improve consistency. 

This MBI product is manufactured using only the highest quality products available to ensure consistent ballistics and firing performance. The propellant is manufactured by Hodgdon, the bullets are manufactured at either the Lake City military manufacturing facilities or by Hornady, and the primers are manufactured by either CCI or Winchester. In addition to using only the best available components, MBI ammunition is assembled using some of the most modern electronic press equipment available. Because exceptional consistency is a major factor in creating accurate ammunition, a production facility that uses finely calibrated electronic press technology is key to ensuring that each shooter is well-pleased with the performance of their ammunition. 

Each brass cartridge casing used to produce MBI ammunition is processed by first undergoing a lengthy mechanical cleansing process. Once cleaned, each casing is then re-calibrated by an electronic press to ensure that the final dimensions of each round are within micrometer tolerances. Each casing is then re-primed and re-charged using high-quality primer and propellants. Once the new bullet is seated using a precision-tuned electronic press, each round is hand-inspected to ensure perfection. 

This product is not just remanufactured ammunition. It is “precision” remanufactured ammunition for the serious shooter. The fact that it costs less than most new ammunition is simply an added benefit"

This one does include the famous ""gill"" slide serrations. Essentially its a precursor to the gen4, but with gen 3 internals in addition to the gen 3 sized grip with aggressive texture.  I bought it expecting to transition to the Glock family and wanted the texture without the Gen 4 (has't been vetted long enough for me to buy into it) however I do not foresee myself transitioning to it as my serious use/training/nightstand firearms. As Such I figured would through my hat in the ring and see if anyone out there is interested in a Glock variant that is getting a little harder to find these days.

-Glock 17 RTF2 with just under 100 WWB rounds through it, includes 2 factory mags, box, lock, bore brush and paperwork (everything it came with)

    I value that this gun is worth around 1450 brand new and is not some gun show garbage gun that is a no name ar with chinese made accessories attached, this is a quality gun with quality high end name brand accessories.
    No, im not willing to part off certain accessories or sell stuff already attached separately so don't bother asking. Anything with ""Century"" stamped on it will not be considered in trade, and I am not interested on glocks gen 2 or below. 
    There is one caveat about trading, I am for the most part open to other trades as long as there one of the guns listed as being part of the trade, and I am pretty reasonable when it comes to that. 
     I will be willing to trade in the Springfield, Ozark, and Nixa area only. I will not ship this rifle to a ffl, and I will not do business with anybody that is out of state or is not legally able to have this gun in the first place.

Contact me via email, I check it at least 3 times a day and if interested I will try to get in contact with you by phone. Put AR15 on the email name so I can sort it out."

**I had an EOTech holographic sight on top, and a Sig Sauer Light/Laser/Strobe in front of the pistol grip for easy activation for home safety and still could have fit 10 more goodies all around the Troy Quad Rail. The EOTech and Sig Sauer Light/Laser were sold to a friend, but the rest is still on the weapon, which shoots like a dream. I know what the weapon is worth. If you're the lucky buyer, you just have to meet me at my local shop and sign a paper saying you are buying the weapon. That simple. Any questions, please email me or call me at REDACTED. Thanks..Craig"

Polytech M14S, all original parts, comes with one 20rd magazine. Chrome lined bore. The stock on this rifle is in good condition but shows wear typical of a used imported rifle that has been loved. Someone e-mailed me that they heard polytechs used receivers made of ""bad metal"", this is simply not true, and in fact in some regards, these rifles are higher quality than their American counterpart. The receiver is forged and the barrel and chamber are chrome lined. Rest assured, this is one kick ass rifle at an excellent price!

I am the second owner. I purchased this from an older gentleman awhile back who had bought it brand new, before the assault weapons ban. He told me he had stuffed it in the corner of his safe and was surprised to discover it while moving. He also mentioned that he had never shot it (which I believe). After I bought it, I also put it in the corner of my safe and haven't touched it until I took the pictures today.

The upper and lower have a VERY tight fit, and the pins are also VERY tight. Best fitment on any AR I've owned (and I've had a lot).

See desc.,"Westminster, Denver, Colorado",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, June 28, 2012",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Tired of this agonizing heat? Want a remote start/keyless entry system installed in your car but don't want to dish out the $400 to have it done? I'm giving the opportunity to local business owners and individuals to trade away a pistol for this product and service. If the trade doesn't match up perfect then cash can be added to either end.

Here's what I'm offering:
Viper 4103 Remote Start System w/ keyless entry
 -Remote engine start
 -Keyless lock/unlock
 -Factory alarm arm/disarm (if equipped and compatible)
 -Panic & horn confirmation
 -Parking light confirmation
 -Trunk release (if electric push button style)
I will also provide:
 -Transponder interface module (90% of cars need this, even without a chip in the key)
 -Relays, diodes, resistors, etc.
My service:
 -Take comfort in knowing that this will be installed by a professional that has been in the business for 13 years. I'm MECP Advanced certified and have a high standard for my installs. My connections are soldered, loomed underhood, and clean wire management. I don't take shortcuts even when you can't see the work done.

The cost for this to be done at a local shop starts at $220, averages $380, and can sometimes go up to the $600 range. Half of the features I listed are not included in the basic install at the shop either and will certainly have added charges.

I'm not trying to discount my service, I'm offering what you want with a handgun as payment. That's all, simple! If needed, I will fill out and pass a CBI as well.

THE BEST PART:
I will come to you to do the install. If you're too busy to come to me than I will come to you. If you want to drop your car off at my house I will do it here. Don't be afraid to make an offer just because your in the springs, I'll go there too (just remember that when valuing the trade)

Although a remote start is being offered, I can install whatever it is you want for your vehicle. Some others are: In-dash monitors & decks, speakers, amplifiers, subwoofers, overhead monitors, headrest monitors, backup cameras, iPod interfaces, alarms, keyless entry systems. Whatever you want done I'm sure I can make it happen.

If you're interested then reply with:
 - your name and email
 - what service you want
 - year/make/model and trim level of your vehicle
 - what you have to trade

I will respond with what the value of the items and service is so we can try to match up a fair trade."

Also known as a type 56 assault rifle made and imported by Norinco.
This is in beautiful condition, only a few very fine scratches in the stock.
No rust spots anywhere, has been in the safe all this time.
All matching serial numbers.
These were imported into America between 1990-1994.
The stock was made as a thumb hole style to ""sporterize"" it.  The grip feels great/ very comfortable in the hand.
I believe the barrel is 16 1/4 inches long.
The rifling is very sharp and clean, from a low round count.
Inherited this from my Uncle a few months ago. Took it apart to check it out before shooting, and it still had much of the grease that it was imported with in the trigger group. I put about 60 rounds through it to dial in the sights, and with the amount left from the only bulk box of ammo that he bought for it, I would say that it has had less than 200 round through it. Not even broken in.  No jams or any other problems.

This comes with everything pictured. 
Plus  a 5 round magazine( not shown.)
and      160 rounds of ammo(not shown)
The extra stock is from another Mak-90, it has some dents and dings in it, but I would cut the grip into a regular handle, slant it back to the butt, to make a cool custom stock, but that's up to you.

The muzzle brake was also from another MAK-90, does not fit, but with a little filing with make a good tight fit.

I would love to keep this and make it a good ""cool"" project, but I already have one AK and don't need another right now.

Warning: I will absolutely require a bill of sale saying that you are not a felon and are allowed to buy and own firearms. I will need your name and drivers licence number. Better if you have a CCW, but not needed.
If this turns you away from the deal, GOOD. 
 I will answer emails back as fast as I can. Want to have a good fair/ trust able sale, not in a super hurry to get rid of it.   If this is what you are wanting, make me a deal. Lowball offers will be laughed at, and not responded to.   This will go to the best trust able offer."
