I received this rifle in a trade but really have no use for it.  I already have a Chinese SKS.  I have not shot this rifle, I cleaned it but haven't taken it to the range due to a lack of funds.  Sadly, now it needs to go due to cut hours at work, not to mention I'm leaving for basic in a few months.  My loss is your gain, these are great and powerful rifles.   A hoot to shoot, and they pack a punch.

This is not the same as a standard Mark II.  It is the Ultralight or Ruger's answer to the mountain rifle.  The rifle itself is far lighter than standard Mark II rifles.  Very, very good condition.  It has one little scuff on the black tip of the stock.  Other than that it is very clean.  Total round count isnt over 3 boxes.

Topped with a Busnell Banner 4-16x40 with illuminated rectagle.  It goes from Green (light power from 1-5) to standard black and then to red (light power from 1-5).  Scope literally has about 8 rounds under it total.  The scope has been in the timber one time.

I bought the rifle, put the glass on it, and it has been sitting in my gun safe for 3-years.  Time to move it to fund another project.

I would sale the Rifle wiithout the scope. 

Rifle Only -> $450
Rifle with glass ->$550

Check your prices.  This is a good deal.  I paid $150.00 for the scope alone from Dongs.  I am selling fairly cheap trying to fund another project. However this is not a have to sell so no scams, low ballers, etc.  Send me an email if youre interested.

Also up for Grabs, Original Colorado Redfield 4X Lo-Pro.  Great fixed power scope from the highly sought after Colorado Redfield line.  The scope has the wide view or TV recticle.  Very good condition for an old scope.  I pulled it off of a rifle.  Would be an excellent Muzzle Loader scope, or even a lower powered rifle (due to the fixed magnification).  Would also be an excellent choice for a high end .22mag, .22lr, .17hmr, .45-70, etc....   Redfield, $75.  I'm watching them sale on ebay for $100+.  One sold today for $101 + Shipping (http://www.ebay.com/itm/ORIGINAL-REDFIELD-WIDEFIELD-4X-RIFLE-SCOPE-GREAT-CONDITION-/REDACTED54?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3f124a429e) so this too is a good buy."

Still left are the 25 WSSM upper and the Century Arms upper and lower complete AR rifle.

The larger upper is an Olympic Arms heavy bull barrel upper chambered in a 25 WSSM (Winchester Super Short Mag). If you dont know much about these you can research them. They are extremely fast and are capable of taking game at 600+ yards with ease. The upper will work on any AR lower and so will the magazine. I have a box of shells and 1 mag that goes with it.

The full complete rifle is a century arms AR-15. It is fun to shoot.  It has the non-detachable carry handle. I have a quad rail handguard setup on it. Makes it heavier than the standard rails. I will also include the stock handguards. It also comes with the adjustable bipod (5inches to 10inches?) shown on it as well as the scope mount rail system that is mounted on the carry handle. I have a couple magazines and about 100 rounds of loose .223 ammo that will also go with it. 

Not hurting or desperate for cash, I just need to clear the gun case out a little. Looking to get $900 for the 25WSSM upper with box of shells and $900 on the Century Arms AR."

I am the original owner and have everything that came with the gun new. It has only been shot twice and has only had Hornady ammunition fired through it. It comes with 2 eight round and 2 ten round magazines. The ten round magazines cost $65 each new.

 The following is from HK's website:
HK45 Compact

Smaller in length and height than the standard HK45, the HK45 Compact (HK45C) uses a slim-line grip profile, otherwise is nearly identical in features to the full-size HK45.

Like the HK45, the HK45 Compact was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life.

Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. The HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 Compacts can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 Compact comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.

Both the HK45 Compact and full-size HK45 use an improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever. The control lever is frame mounted and is quickly accessible; it has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 and HK45C can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45C is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system, providing an enhanced double action trigger pull.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45C is currently being made at HK’s new American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.
Key features and system characteristics::

Integral MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories
ERGO (HK45 full-size) and slim-line (HK45 Compact) grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference
8-round metal magazine is standard for the HK45C, common high-capacity (10 rounds) that fit both the HK45 and HK45C also available
Ambidextrous controls with dual slide releases and enlarged magazine release
Uses the proven modified Browning linkless recoil operating system
O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and better accuracy
Polygonal rifling for longer barrel life and increased accuracy
Improved ergonomic control levers (safety and/or decocking)
Low profile drift adjustable 3-dot sights
Contoured and radiused slide with forward slide (grasping) grooves and anti-glare longitudinal ribs
Black polymer frame

Suggested Retail Price: $1,147 (DA/SA with control lever), $1,237 (LEM enhanced DAO model without control lever)."

They also include a patented child-proof locking key system, which prevents the gun from firing when not in use for additional safety. This gun has never been fired and is in factory new condition. Included are the original box, owner's manual, original warranty card, keys and the original factory grips. These guns have a Lifetime Warranty, which is in full force and effect through Taurus USA out of Miami, FL. Due to the fact that these gun's production run has ended and the fact that they have a Lifetime Warranty, they will fast become collector's items. These guns are extremely well made, well balanced and look and feel great in the hand. No Trades. $690.00 OBO"

from Gunblast.com
An AR rifle like the Prairie Panther can do double duty as a fighting rifle better than an M-4 style can double as an accurate hunting rifle. The Prairie Panther is wonderfully accurate, easy to use, and light enough to carry afield all day. It is as suitable for home defense as it is for shooting prairie dogs at 400 yards. There are many variations of the AR-15 rifle on the market today, and they are fine weapons. I own several, but if I had to pare down to just one AR-15, I would keep a good, accurate, reliable hunting style AR, like one of these new Prairie Panther rifles from DPMS.

From Remington Arms Website;
Reliability has always been a longstanding hallmark of Remington‚ autoloaders.
The Model 11-87™ is no different.
Its patented pressure-compensating gas system is the biggest reason why.
The same gun you use one day on the skeet range can be used the next day in the goose blind.
And while many have tried to copy its dependable performance and versatility, none have come remotely close.
Take the time-honored, all-weather dependability of the Model 11-87 action and combine it with the capability to handle high-payload shotshells.
Now prepare to rule the flyway.
Ultimately versatile for today's varied waterfowl (or any other) hunting situations.
Its patented self-cleaning pressure-compensating gas system, delivers reliable shell cycling with virtually any load.
Impressive.

This one happens to be 30-06 and additional lower and upper barrels are available to make it multiple caliber combinations. It has the Valmet scope base/mount that will be included.  This gun has a few surface blemishes from being covered in Camo Tape for hunting, (it has been passed down through the family), but according to all the gunsmith's I've taken it to, it could be removed and touched up with a little TLC. However, the gun is otherwise in excellent condition. The bores are perfect and stocks are near perfect. Round count is very low and I expect it to be about a box in either barrel. No, this is not the Savage copy.  I'm located in Louisiana and Prefer Face to Face transaction but will ship to your FFL Dealer of choice.  Also, we can negotiate on shipping costs.

shot shell length of 2-2/4"" and 3"". The shotgun is characterized by high reliability in harsh 

environments, and is capable of delivering single-shot fire and is reloaded automatically due to 

the energy of the powder gases, escaping from the barrel bore to the gas cylinder and the energy 

of the spring as well. This shotgun comes with a 19"" barrel, 5 round magazine, and synthetic

I am not sure of the brands of accessories but I am sure they are fairly high quality. 

This is a tack driving custom built .22! I have only shot it a few times using the half box of 40 gr. Wolf Match he gave me with it and it was scary accurate. I am not much for the bench shooting so I don’t need to keep it. I am looking to buy some Rev War Re-enactment gear so this will help finance that.

It has a heavy bull barrel, heavy bench composite stock, adjustable flip down bi-pod, adjustable but plate and three magazines. The trigger is very sweet as well. Again, being an amateur 1911 guy, I don’t know a whole bunch about these kind of accessories.

The scope seems to be pretty nice as well. It is a Simmons Pro Hunter Master Series 6-21 x 44mm MilDot Reticle with Target Turrets MOA 1/8 Adjustments & Side Focus Parallax Adjustments with Butler Creek Flip-Up Covers and adjustable quick release mount.

He told me had had well over $700 into it and given his addiction to bench shooting I would believe it. 

I am asking $350 for the entire package and if FTF I will even throw in a brick (500 rounds) of .22 ammo. I would also consider a trade for Rev War repro musket or XD-9. I prefer FTF in Upstate or Greenwood, SC but I will ship to your FFL if you cover costs."

""The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.""

Camo finishes on today's modern firearms has nearly been perfected, if not perfect now. They adhere well, blend in perfectly with the intended surroundings and protect the gun from scratches, dings and the weather. The Maxus Mossy Oak Duck Blind does more than just conceal possible glare, shine and add a protective finish. It is the best camo out there, and Browning has teamed with Mossy Oak to produce the best camo finishes ever for the best firearms in the business.

The Duck Blind finish is ideal for the marsh, and that would include flooded timber, cattails, reeds, open water, jump shooting and even hunkering down against a dike among the rocks and gravel. This a light gun to carry long distances if you have to ride a bike or walk to the hunting site. It features all of the deluxe, hunter-friendly components of any Maxus model, including Invector-Plus tubes and the Lightning Trigger System. This is the gun for waterfowling, upland game or even sport shooting. The Mossy Oak Duckblind camo finish is coated with Dura-Tough Armor Coating. If you pick the shotgun up, it feels a tad sticky. Where you place your hands is pretty much where they want to stay. Not that iit is a tacky feel, but just a very sure feel. It makes the gun easier to pick up, handle, shoulder and fire. It aids in packing the gun and lessens your worries of any cosmetic damages. It provides a true outdoor-element shedding tool with a superior gripping surface.  You know you already trust the action and the workings on the inside, now trust the rugged camo-finished Maxus shotguns on the outside."

Since the introduction of Hornady’s new .17 caliber rimfire cartridge several months ago, the little hotshot has really caught on with shooters and varmint hunters. Besides Hornady, other ammo makers have now jumped aboard, and several companies are now making rifles chambered for the little seventeen. Gunblast has been a proponent of the seventeen since its introduction. It has proven to be an accurate and flat-shooting cartridge, and works extremely well within its intended purpose. The nay-sayers who predicted that it would not catch on are now eating the crow upon which the .17 HMR is so effective. The little .17 is here to stay."

I am asking $700 for everything. You can e-mail me with offers and I may take something on trade. I will be look at all offers and respond so I don't keep you hanging.

History of The FR8:
The FR7 and FR8 were introduced as the Spanish military was already implementing the CETME automatic rifle, but did not yet have sufficient inventory to equip and train all troops. The rifles were made from existing stockpiles of Mauser bolt-action rifles and apart from the military for training purposes, it was also used as a service weapon by the Guardia Civil. The flash hider was designed to be compatible with NATO-standard rifle grenades."

There is also some slight holster wear on each side of the barrel. It has Rosewood grips and 3 clips (2 of which have pinky extensions).

The last picture shows the Bavarian Police mark that has been X'ed out, as well as the import stamp on the handle.
