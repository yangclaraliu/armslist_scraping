I have consistently hit the bull’s-eye (CD size) at 35 ft. during qualifications using it and federal 230 grain FMJ ammo. I love using this gun. My wife says our little one needs new baby furniture not the baby eagle, I sadly agree. This price is $75 lower than what others are selling there’s for and a new one is about $680. I need to sell this soon.

PS. the last picture I have photo shopped the Serial # just in case you were wondering about the color impurity’s.

One if a Guerini Summit Limited Sporting O/U and the other is a Guerini Maxum Sporting O/U. Send me a pm if you want pictures. I'm currently in Katy, but I would be willing to meet up anywhere around the Houston area if need be. If the gun needs to be shipped, add $50 for shipping to your ffl.

Both guns were purchased in February of 2011 and have less than 1000 rounds through each and each gun has all three of the free guerini pit stops intact. I haven't used any of them yet. Both guns have very minimal wear. The barrels have no dings, but the stocks on both guns have just 2-3 dings from general wear and wear. The perlaged areas on both guns on the barrel that meets up with the receiver have a couple tiny spots, but this can easily be removed with some CLP or guerini can make the gun look like new with their free pit stop program they offer gun owners (you get three of them for free). Both guns come complete with everything originally in the case including the chokes,, receiver sleeve, etc...

I'm looking for $2750 for the summit and $4500 for the maxum. The only trades I am considering right now are long range rifles, preferably a tricked out remington 700 in .308, a sako TRG 22 in 308, an FN SPR in 308 or any custom gun in 308. These prices are firm. I haven't set the price artifically high like most people in hopes to be negotiated with.

It has a Lifetime warranty from manufacturer in Ohio. They have a no questions asked, transferable warranty and easy, good service from what I hear. You can Google their warranty yourself.

Here's the catch. I shot it today and I couldn't get it to cycle more than two rounds...if it would cycle the second at all. It shot fine, when I chambered a round, but other than that I had trouble with it. It also dropped the magazine a couple times when I fired it.

I only have the one magazine, so the mag may be the trouble, but I don't know and don't feel like messing with it. I would suggest sending it back  to the manufacturer and having them check it out since it's under warranty.

I have a Ruger LCP with Crimson Trace laser that my wife bought last year. Has about 350 rounds through it. She just prefers the heft of her 4"" 357. Anyway, comes with upgrades and spare parts. 

Ruger LCP Guide Rods x2 $4.00
Ruger LCP Recoil Springs(inner and outer) x2 $8.00
Ruger LCP Take Down Pin x2 $5.00
Ruger LCP Extractor Spring x2 $4.00
Ruger LCP Firing Pin x2 $16.00
Ruger LCP Extractor x1 $7.00
$9.00 S&H paid for Ruger spare parts
BT Guide Rod - $25.00
Wolff Spring Calibration Pak(firing pin springs, recoil springs) $25.00
4 Promag 6 Round Magazines - $75.00
Fobus Paddle Mag Pouch x2 - $50.00
Leather Belt Holster $37.00
Pocket Holster - $12.00
Crimson Trace - $180.00
Ruger LCP $290.00

Plus original magazine, guide rod, springs, box, all paperwork, lock, keys, etc.

I take personal defense seriously and wanted to make sure the gun was completely dependable and that extra parts were available immediately should they become lost or broken. I do this with every firearm I own. When SHTF, where are you going to buy extra parts should the need arise? 
It's accurate and the recoil is mild. Especially with the extra power Wolff springs. Looking for a trade value of $635(15% off retail) or $595.00(20% off retail) cash. I can add 800 rounds of XTP hollow point ammo depending on price difference. 

We're good on handguns so mainly looking for long gun trades. Here is what we're interested in and in order of interest:

5.7x28mm(AR57 platform, complete or upper only)
22 LR(10/22, Marlin 60, possibly others mag/tube semi/bolt)
22 magnum(mag/tube semi/bolt prefer Savage, Marlin)
22-250 Savage with Accutrigger
204 Savage with Accutrigger
357 magnum(lever action only)
45-70(lever action only)
12 ga pump(maverick 88/Mossberg 500/Rem 870)
12 ga SxS
410 Saiga


The addition of cash/ammo by either party will be determined by real world value. A new LCP with Crimson Trace runs $500+- without all the extras. My prices are fair and(in my opinion) how a used firearm should be priced.

I'm not willing to part this out. I don't need to sell/trade this, so I can wait for the right buyer to come along."

I Have a FAB defense grip on it as well as an NEA Phoenix Flash Suppressor and a Tactical Bolt Release. What makes this gun great is that the bolt locks back on the last round and the trigger finger can activate the bolt release. Two things that an AK cannot do. It is also a milled receiver as apposed to a stamped receiver. The only downside is that the magazines are specific to the gun and cannot be interchanged with AK mags. Luckily, if you buy this gun, you get 11 thirty round magazines. Also, a .30 cal bore snake comes with the gun. Also included is a Czech Army surplus 4 mag leather holder and a clip on set of night sights. Original grips shipped with the rifle. Any questions, feel free to ask.
