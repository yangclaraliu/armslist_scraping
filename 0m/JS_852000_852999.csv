It's a 16GB wifi-only model with Retina display, etc. Works perfectly. See all the details about it here: http://store.apple.com/us/buy/home/shop_ipad/family/ipad

The screen is in like-new condition (has had a screen protector on it since we bought it). The bubbles you see in the picture are ONLY in the screen protector (didn't get it entirely smooth when we put it on; feel free to replace it).
The only ""bad"" thing about it is that it has a knick in the metal housing on the bottom right corner (our toddler got ahold of it for a second while we had our back turned). This doesn't affect the operation of the iPad in any way.

Long story short, we're working to become debt-free so we can help support some ministry opportunities, and so... we're selling some things!
Retails new for $500. We're asking $400 for it, and will include the USB cord and wall charger for it too. I think we've even got the box around here somewhere if you'd like it.

To help us weed through the spammers, please include the exact phrase (without quotes) ""iWant your iPad"" in the subject line. If that's not the subject line, we won't even respond to your e-mail; thanks for understanding."

...read this from the OK Shooter forum; I copied and pasted it for you:

I do not have a link as of yet but here is what I have found out…

Stopped by my local Wal Mart this morning. They are out of almost every kind of ammo.
I asked to talk to the person in charge of ordering to see if they had any information on this subject.
The manager I talked to said they had not heard anything…BUT.
She tried to order some .223 as I was standing there. She said the order was being rejected by the corporate office. Said she had never had that happen.

She called corporate as I was standing there.
And was told this. “As of right now Wal Mart is not going to be making any new orders of ammo because of the upcoming decision on the second amendment”. Said, “As of right now we are unsure of what new legislation might be coming, and because of this, we are suspending new orders. We will continue to sell what is already in stocking stores and at our distribution centers, but any new orders will not be shipped until the issue is resolved”.

So after they run out, there will be no restocking until Obama makes his decision…Hows that change working out for you now?

As I said, I dont have a link, but you can call Wal Mart headquarters at 1-REDACTED for yourself and ask. After the answer press 2 then 1 then 1 again and wait to talk to a rep. I just did this myself and was told the same thing.

Something must have changed at the meeting they had on Thursday.
Guess we will have to wait and see what Obama has in store for us next.

Guys, I am not making this up…Call and find out for yourself.

Another confirmation:

There is a lot of stuff here that I collected when I was younger. Total value new was around $920. I am not one of those people who thing that you get what you paid for your things new that is stupid its used it has depreciated I understand that. Though I do feel that everything here is worth $200 in cash. May be a little negotiable but id rather give it to my younger brothers and cousins than take much less than that. One of the tanks is full so you can do a function check on the guns. I will sell any part individually although would rather sell it all at once. If you want a particular piece then shoot me a message with what you want and your offer. Thanks for looking. 

Trades: 
.223 ammo
Ar mags
Ar accessories
Cash
Glock 23 I will add cash
Possibly other .40 cal or 9mm pistols
Other items possible just shoot me an offer thanks for looking."

These rifles are a huge step up from a standard AK-47. These have a grenade launcher sight with a built in gas block shut-off for launching grenades. Due to the recoil of launching a grenade the rifle has a 50% thicker reciever than a standard AK which greatly increases accuracy.  and this one still has the FULL AUTO RECIEVER AND STILL HAS THE SELECT FIRE SWITCH ""not full auto though"" and the bolt is twice the size of all the other AK's. it is a very robust and rugged design. It has all of the Yugo markings unlike just about all of the other Yugo's. VERY RARE.  It has a Tapco trigger group that has been polished for a super smooth trigger. The folding stock locks up rock solid with no play at all.  It also has flip up night sights in the front and rear, these are the ONLY AK's that have that feature. It has a chrome bolt, chrome carrier, and a chrome piston. Threaded barrel with a slant break installed. And the finish on this rifle is beautiful. I would rate it at 95%. It has an extremely low round count, only about 90 rounds have been through it. The rifle comes with one 30 round mag, your choice of a metal Yugo or a polymer Tapco. These rifles are in a class of their own, there is nothing cheap about this rifle, unlike the majority of the AK's that are out there today. Due to the ban coming up now is the time to buy!

Description for the TSD Mag15:
Light weight polymer body and hardened steel feed lips, they combine the best features of polymer and steel mag designs. The one piece wrap-around hardened steel feed lip assembly, PTFE coated for corrosion resistance, is permanently attached to the impact resistant polymer body, unlike the polymer lips they won't bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. The aggressive surface texture on the polymer body improves the grip, easing retrieval from pouches and allows for more positive control when manipulating them. The internal geometry and non-tilting follower of the mag is optimized to feed the 5.56X45mm round. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant.

The floorplate is slimmer than other polymer magazines, making it easier to use in double mag pouches. Disassembly is simple: use a round of ammo to depress the locking plate and slide the floorplate to the rear and off the magazine body.

Material Specification:
• Body Assembly: Nylon
• Feed Lips: AISI 1074 Carbon Steel, .030in thick, Hardened to RC 48 to 52.
• Floor Plate: Nylon
• Spring: Stainless steel
• Follower: Delrin • Weight: 4.4oz

Well taken care of, always cleaned and lubed. Prefer to sell locally rather than shipping. $900 obo.

UPDATE: 87 rounds have been fired through it (all brass-case factory loads, American Eagle and Remington... no cheap steel).  The rifle is in perfect working order, has no physical or aesthetic flaws, never been dropped, and has been stored in temperature and humidity controlled environment since it was bought new in October.  It came with two 30-round metal mags from the manufacturer, which I would sell for $15 each.  I forgot to mention that it has a single-point sling, which is included in the asking price.  I am selling because I would rather have a bolt-action deer rifle, which I have already ordered from Cabela's.  Picture now posted."

They are COMPLETE ROLLS from 1909DVB /plus 1909 plain\ unltil 2010. These rolls have been collected over many years. From 1958 up all are uncirculeted. All others are in good to fine. 1943 steel roll is blast white and uncirculated. These constitue a complete ROLL of at least 46 47 pennies minted at the philadelpa mint. Actually they all should be 50 but been years since I put them up. I have many rolls from the denver..san francisco mints also. Can make a complete count and send pics. All rolls are in quality square poly tubes and then fit in a lock box. As precious metals at all time high so has copper gone up. Someone could sell these as sets on internet and make some decent profit. I'm to old to mess with it. So collectors feel free to text for further info.>..............can't seem to make paragraphs so bear with me please. 5 years in 6th grade english as a first language and still can't handle it. What I'm looking for: a decent 308 varmint type rifle. Bull barrel in 24 in or so for my son. Had originally wanted a 223 upper with target barrel compensator etc but these black guns have gone completely out of sight. I love the ptr91 H&K clones in 308. Wood stocks rock my boat. I'm old school as to what I like. Also love Ruger single action revolvers. I don't mind someone getting an excellent trade as long as I get what I want too. Can accept other things to make up boot .. cash either way but no price gouged black guns zDecent trades only will be considered. I also love ruger 10/22s and mini 14s. Thanx to all for your time and patience with this rambling mis spelled ad. .

Don't buy from the tool asking for $50 that's absurd.  $34.99 is a bad price to but you can but them new form kygunco right now and get for less than this hack is selling them for.

Very nice, clean little rifle for its age. Shoot's great, actually better then my newer Mini-14. Rifle is blued and marked ""200th Year of American Liberty"" on the receiver. Its been drilled and tapped for a scope rail (included) and has a older 3x9x40mm scope (included). Comes with one original, factory 5rd magazine and one aftermarket 20rd magazine. Also comes with the original wooden hand guard. Which is rare. Typically, replaced with one of the plastic offerings. Not this one!

So if you've been looking for a Mini-14 but, can't justify the high price's of $1200+. Here's your chance to own one, that is actually a collectable. The President is going to make sure “we”, can never buy these again, because we’ll shoot our eye out. Grab it while the grabbing is good. Because when he finally does make his announcement in the next few day’s, and he imposes his will on us, the price will go up.

This SKS was imported in 1994.  These models were imported for about two years in the nineties and are the only SKS variant that takes AK-47 magazines as a factory setup.  This is a GREAT SHTF rifle.  It has a chrome lined barrel, so corrosive ammo is not a problem. 

Many people find the SKS-M more comfortable and accurate to shoot than the AK-47 while maintaining the same reliability and shooting capacity.  

The SKS setup from the factory to accept Ak-47 mags is superior to a SKS modified to take large magazines.  It is more reliable and keeps the rifle in its factory condition.

This is not an American conversion or Tapco.  This rifle is set up from the factory to take AK Mags, Similar to SKS-D

Has a Monte Carlo Stock.  Some of these were shipped with a thumbhole stock.  

Selling with Sling, 20rd Steel Magazine, and 100 rounds of 7.62x39 ammo.

""Assault weapons -- defined as any rifle with a ""military style"" feature, such as a bayonet or a telescoping stock -- that are currently owned would be grandfathered and would have to be registered with the state. Magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds and manufactured before 1994, which are currently legal, would have to be turned over to authorities or sold out of state within one year. If a magazine has a capacity between eight and 10, it would have to be retrofitted to only hold seven rounds.

Under Cuomo's plan, the state would have one year to set up an instant background check system for all ammunition purchases. Law enforcement would be alerted to large purchases of ammunition.""
