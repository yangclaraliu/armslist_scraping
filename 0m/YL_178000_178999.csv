So... I'd like to trade it for something I can use. Brass for  30-06 springfield, 45 acp, 7.62 x , 45-70?  Or what have you.... 

About 1/2 of it is sorted and cleaned already.  It is wcc stamped.  1/4 of is is sorted and not cleaned... pmc stamped.  The remaining 1/4 is a mix of the other two. 

I have weighed it and extrapolated the count so it is approximate... but I am posting it as less that it figured out to be. I know 9mm is less than 30-06 etc so a 2 for 1 or something agreeable is acceptable as a trade. 

It is good looking stuff I just can't shoot it."

It features a threaded barrel, so you can add flash hiders, muzzle breaks or what have you. It also uses a piston design much like the AKs. It has a take down pin, so it will fold down and fit in a bag or backpack. Nice little brush gun. I bought it because it accepts AR mags and was cheaper than buying another AR. I just don't need two 5.56 rifles, so here it is. Much easier to add accessories than a Mini-14 and cheaper than even the cheap ARs. Fills a nice little niche.

I purchased this gun in May and have had a lot of fun with it - I've put roughly 600 rounds down the pipe and it has been a smooth, reliable shooter from round one. Exactly what you'd expect from an AK. I've thoroughly cleaned this gun after every trip to the range - the internals are rust- and corrosion-free, and the exterior shows very little wear and tear.

I did buy the rifle used, but could swear that it had never been fired. The guys at Bill's told me that the original owner had inherited his father's 47 and no longer wanted the 74. I've no idea why - it has been very accurate and (as mentioned) quite reliable. I test ran a 5 MOA red dot on the rifle and was shooting 1"" groups at 25 yards, from a hot barrel even (I'll be the first to admit, I'm not a very good shot, so you can probably expect better). 

I'm including the original magazines I received with it (x2 fire-brick Circle-21 mags), a Saiga optic rail that I fitted to the rifle (mounts to the tang and the sight leaf), a UTG 5-position foregrip, the original polymer furniture, a Tufforce quad rail handguard (currently mounted), a Magpul AFG (currently mounted), a Hogue rubber grip (currently mounted), a green NcStar rifle sling (currently mounted), and a rubber recoil buffer (currently installed). I'll be throwing in 200 rounds of TulAmmo hollow points as well.

May be interested in trades - particularly toward a Sig P226/P220 or a Beretta 92FS. Possibly other items - can't hurt to ask!

I have enough small calibers and want something larger.  Although if the price is right I might consider selling.

The gun came from the factory with 2 barrels one 3.4"" and a 5"" target barrel.  When the target barrel is on, there is a shroud that fits over it so the barrel is not exposed.  It still has all of the original grips and sights that came with the gun.  

I brought it to a gun shop and it was rated at 96%.  I only put a few clips through each barrel.  It is apparently a special edition model and is supposed to be worth $400-$450, but the shop has to make money and I was only offered $250 so I decided to try and sell it here.

I'm not necessarily expecting an even trade, but don't screw me over either.

This gun is a great shooter and I can easily shoot a one-ragged hole group at 25 yards off of a rest. I have just lost interest in shooting a scoped handgun.

IMO, the -4 is the best 686 to mount a scope on, it is drilled from the factory for a mount, but it retains the forged hammer/trigger (no-MIM on this one) and has no lock. Lockup is tight and timing is perfect.

The scope rings are Burris Signature Zee which are very stable and high quality, some of the best rings on the market. Please note that this gun does NOT have the original rear sight included, however they are available from S&W.

I am looking for $625 for the setup. FTF preferable within an hour of the Lewistown area, but I will ship to a FFL on your dime. I will sell/trade the gun without the optics, but I will absolutely not part out the optics unless the gun goes first.

The .22 Magnum Mini-Revolver is the ultimate in up front, personal, close-in protection. It''s small, easy to conceal and safe to carry. Whether you carry it for hiking and camping, or for self-defense, this gun delivers when you need it most. As with every NAA Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge. The North American Arms .22 Magnum can be used with all popular .22 Magnum ammunition, including .22 Magnum shot shells (called Snake Shot by some manufacturers)."

250mm (9.84"") barrel

The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG). The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42. The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43. This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946). The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied.

I.O. Inc. redesigned this historical firearm to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the triggerguard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position.

This pistol is manufactured at the famed Radom Plant in Poland. All parts and components are new and Polish made."

The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally new trigger system. The new Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever(installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design of the Duty and a new sleek slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry.

There's some other items that cost me money on this gun but you get the point. While this all adds up to just over $2000 I do realize this gun has a round count. I'm in need of bill paying and just can't hold out any longer on this and must sell it. I'm including what I paid so you can measure the value of what I want for it all. 

Always carefully cleaned after every few hundred rounds and properly lubed with twb25 grease, never dropped, no blemishes, dings, scratches, nothing. It's an outstanding gun I built (one of many I've built over the years) adhering to every possible military specification I could find (arfcom, m4carbine.net, etc.) so it is no ""boutique"" or ""hobby"" gun, it's a battle rifle through and through.

$1350 is what I""m after. I'll only drive as far north as Missoula for delivery if you can't make it to Hamilton. Too much stuff to ship so don't ask. This is your chance to get a non 4473'd top quality battle carbine with 400+ rounds and all the accessories you'd need...and brass to reload with. I need cash only, sorry no trades. I can make good, detailed videos or send better quality pics if you'd like, so don't hesitate to ask. 

Thanks for looking!

It has magazine dimples in the receiver (unlike the WASR-10s) so you don't have to worry about magazine wobble.  It also has the side rail mount for optics mounting.

It has a chrome lined barrel (so good if you shoot corrosive ammo).  Included is all that you see: SAR-1, sling, cleaning kit (fits in buttstock), 3 x 30 rd magazines, 1 x 10 rd magazine, UTG quad rail (with 12 rubber rail covers, these are awesome to protect against heat) which replaces with front handguards so you can mount lasers, optics, bipod, whatever, broom handle fore grip, and 100 rounds of silver bear ammo.
