There are a bunch of people selling their DPMS Oracle crap ARs on here for 1400+ and getting it. That's twice what it's worth. If you want a top of the line AR, this is it. I built it modeled after a SEAL CQB M4. 160 rounds through this rifle and not a scratch on her.. Price is firm at 2900. Bravo Company is sold out of just about everything, lowers are scarce, PMAGs are even more scarce. 

I will require OH DL and must be over 21 to purchase, this isn't a kids toy. CHL holders are a plus. I have my CHL as well. Must meet in or around Columbus. Preferably Upper Arlington or Worthington. Again, I don't need to sell so please no offers less than the asking price.

STAIGHT BODY with eyepiece

The APO-Televid 82 delivers superb optical performance for brilliant insights into nature that are rich in detail and contrast - from dawn until dusk.

The combination of the apochromatic optics with their new FL glass and the 82 mm front lens diameter increase the light yield, compared to the previous models, by more than 6%!
The eye piece is fast bayonet mounted and has a magnification of 25x to 50x. It has a very wide angle viewing area, which gives the user a unusually wide field view. The object you are viewing is not only magnified, but also the surrounding area and thus its context can also be observed exactly.
You can now also take a ""scoped"" photo of your favourite subject easily using an adapter designed specifically for the LEICA D-LUX4 digital camera
The key benefits of the APO-Televid 82:

_ innovative four part, new flouride glass, lenses for ideal colour fidelity and contrast
_ optically neutral front lens glass protects the APO optics
_ precise focusing is easy with the dual focus system including microfocusing
_ very short focal length of 12.8ft (only 3,9m)
_ water and dust repellent AquaDuraTM-coating
_ highly robust, rubber armoured, magnesium housing
_ waterproof to a depth of 17ft (5m)
_ new variable wide-angle zoom eyepiece 25-50 x WW ASPH
Available colors and materials:

OVERVIEW:

Remington brought the hunting-rifle prowess, and a leading manufacturer of modular repeating rifles introduced us to the 308 Win platform. What emerged is a masterwork of game-dropping performance and hunt-specific features that will load any camp’s meat pole with unrivaled efficiency – the new Model R-25. An advanced, highly lethal blend of accuracy, fast followups and light recoil chambered for three of today’s most popular short-action hunting cartridges – 243 Win, 7mm-08 Remington and 308 Win. This rifle is everything varmint and predator hunters love about our R-15 in a beefed-up design that easily handles cartridges suitable for big-game hunting.

For peak accuracy, its precision-crafted 20"" ChroMoly barrel is freefloated within the machined aluminum fore-end tube. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block keep weight to a minimum and facilitate rapid heat dissipation. The barrel also features a recessed hunting crown to protect the rifling and aid in more consistent bullet flight. When it’s time to make the shot, the R-25’s ergonomic pistol-grip gives you unmatched control and rock-steady aim. As a whole, this rifle has a balanced, stable design that makes it deadly from the offhand position. True to our hunting market, the traditional two-stage trigger found on AR-platform rifles has been exchanged for a crisp, single-stage version that comes from the factory set at 4 1/2 to 5 lbs.

Its carefully tuned upper and lower are machined from rugged aluminum forgings. The entire gun is dressed in Mossy Oak® Treestand™ camo that makes it virtually invisible in the field. We included a 4-round magazine, and the R-25 is compatible with DPMS 308 Win-type magazines and accessories. front and rear sling swivel studs are installed.

Free-floated button-rifled 0.680"" Muzzle OD ChroMoly barrels with recessed hunting crown for superior accuracy

316,http://www.armslist.com/posts/767316,For Sale:  Modern Military Modular Integrated Communications Helmet,"Sierra Vista, Tucson, Arizona",$ 300,"Listed On: Saturday, December 29, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling a current size Large military MICH Helmet. There is some room to negotiate, but please let's not be insulting because you took lessons from pawn stars, storage wars or you think you're a know it all like the fellas on Duck Dynasty! Send me an email with questions. See the pics for more details. Also don't get mad this is buisness if you get out bidded that's life this is a site to make money and not charity. Wear your big boy/girl panties and deal with it!


The MICH ranges in weight from about 3 lb (1.36 kg) (size medium) to just over 3.6 lb (1.63 kg) (extra large). It uses a new, more advanced type of Kevlar and provides increased protection against handgun rounds.

A pad system and four-point retention system, similar to the cushions and straps found on bicycle helmets, replaces the nylon cord suspension system, sweatband and chinstrap found on the PASGT helmet. The change provides greater impact protection and comfort for the wearer. It can be fitted with a mounting bracket for an AN/PVS-14 monocular night vision device (MNVD) on the front, similar to that on the PASGT helmet. It can also be fitted with a pair of straps on the rear to keep protective eyewear in place, as well as cloth helmet covers in varying camouflage patterns including M81 Woodland, three-color desert, USMC MARPAT, U.S. Army UCP, Crye MultiCam, and solid black for use with SWAT teams. As with its PASGT predecessor, the MICH is often worn with a band around it which features a pair of reflective ""cat eyes"" -- patches on the back intended to prevent friendly fire incidents.

The MICH is also slightly smaller than the PASGT, providing 8% less coverage. This accounts for some of the reduced weight and allows for both greater situational awareness and less obstruction of the wearer's vision, particularly when combined with Interceptor body armor. Previously, soldiers had complained that the high collar of the Interceptor pushed the back of the helmet forward, in turn moving the helmet brim over their eyes when they attempted to fire from a prone position."

Stock description - ""The HS Precision PSV74 varmint stock, which is a hybrid between the tactically oriented Police stock found on the 700P and the more handy stocks found on the Remington Varmint Synthetic and Sendaro lines. The stock comes with a very nicely shaped palm swell that instantly places the hand in the proper position for solid trigger control. The 3 inch wide forearm has a re-curve in it which makes for very comfortable placement of your fingers in offhand positions. It also provides a very stable rest for bench shooting. The forearm is shorter than that found on the tactical rifles, making for a nice balance between solid feel and portability. Of course the stock comes with HS Precision's full-length aluminum bedding chassis system and it is a true drop in."""

I personally would not get ""down and dirty"" by shooting it like an SKS or AK since ammo is expensive and hard to find. Also, this rifle is not new by any means so please dont expect it to be in brand new pristine condition however, it does fire and function. Comes with proper sling, fixed foldable bayonet and 2 boxes of 7.62x45 (30rnds total). Ideal for a Milsurp collector and Im willing to drive out as far as Marysville to make the sale but no farther. I'll also throw in a soft rifle carrying case in ACU Pattern with the rifle.

The SA-93 rifles are dressed in a wood stockset, while the SLR-95 wears polymer. These rifles have original chrome lined hammer forged barrels and Bugarian milled receivers, some of the best.

I am selling one of my safe queens that never gets used. It's a rare Sino-Soviet (Made in China with Russian Parts) which makes it the Best of the SKS' in terms of quality/fit/function. It's milled. It is a rare paratrooper and the crown is immaculate. It has a 16"" barrel (carbine).

If you want to use an optic on an sks, you basically gotta mount it to the dust cover, and well, it's a dust cover. It's not very secure. This one has the rare Cowboy's Companion mount on the receiver for mounting optics properly.  It's been in the family for a long time and it's time to find it a good home as I am in need of the funds.

SKS collectors know, this is the most accurate, rarest, desirable SKS ever made. You will never find one of these at a gun show. This is the best of the best of the SKS'. Ask the gurus. The gun is #'s matching, not a parts gun like most every other on the market nor was it a cosmoline queen. If you know quality, you know this rare rifle is the real deal. It just sits in the safe and it's time to go.

It comes with the 40rd mag, a 20rd, and the 10rd box mag.  I believe most places still have the 20rd mags in stock for ~$15 each. I realize the increase in price of Semi-Autos recently and honestly doubt the price even reflects this. I have a few boxes of ammo I will throw in also.

No pure AK builds like this have come since '99.  This SLR95 has been ""re-militarized"" by me and brought to 922(r) compliance with 5 US made parts: K-var Warsaw Pact length butt stock, traditional Bulgarian designed K-var pistol grip, and a Tapco G2 double-hook trigger group (3 parts).  The gun also includes the original Bulgarian parts (sporter stock and trigger group) and it's legal to reconfigure it in it's pure Bulgarian state..just doesn't look as cool.  There's a Krebs Custom safety switch that has the bolt-hold-open notch and a edge sticking up so you can operate it while keeping your hand on fire control.  See close-up pic below.

The SLR95 is a milled receiver AK which gives it better rigidity, a more solid barrel/receiver lock-up, and it's more to spec than the stamped receiver AKs.  A milled receiver translates to greater reliability, longevity, and even better accuracy than it's stamped counterparts.  No rivets, a cool lightning cut over the mag well, a more precise magwell (stamped AKs that get imported to the US have all kinds of different magwell fits and are often out of spec).  It's got a very clever brake pinned on that keeps the muzzle down nicely.  This gun shoots much smoother than the Arsenal (Russian) and Bulgarian stamped AK I've had in the past and is much more accurate.  I can bang the 300 yard irons 6 out of 10 times compared to barely hitting it with the stamped AKs I've had.  THis one is sweet.

I've got just under 500 rounds through it (90 put through it today!) without a problem.  It's been cleaned carefully after each shoot (even though it doesn't need it).  I've polished all parts that rub metal (no metal taken off!!) and have only used lithium grease sparingly in a couple spots.

3 weeks ago this gun, used, was worth between $1k-$1200 easily just for it's rarity.  It comes with 7 mags 30 round Bulgarian mags loaded with 7.62x39 ammo (200+ rounds) and the Bulgarian sporter stock, Bulgarian dust cover with the picatinny rail secured to it firmly, and the original Bulgarian trigger group.  With current supply and demand, these good Bulgarian mags are an easy $50 a piece and the ammo a good 40 cents a round adding $430 value to the gun.  In this market, I don't think it's too much to ask $1850 for it all.

Chambered in 357 magnum/38 special. When I talked to a S&W Rep. on the phone for a replacement key (for the internal lock) he had said that the serial number would date the production to December of 2008. As for the gun, the only thing that has been done to it was installing a Hogue monogrip. I have only put about 25 rounds of 357 and 30 rounds of 38 through it. Thoroughly cleaned after shooting. Fixed front sight (removable, but not adjustable) and notched rear sight. It is extremely accurate, and would easily hit a quarter size bulls-eye at 10+ yards. The trigger is smooth with a 2.5lb SA and 9lb DA trigger pull. Comes with the gun, a pistol sock, and the key.

For the right deal, I also have some accessories. I have two Quickstrips, two Safariland speedloaders, a Crossbreed Supertuck IWB holster, a smaller fabric IWB/Pocket holster, a kydex trigger guard used for waistband carry without a holster, and some defense ammo. 

I would much rather trade since some people are asking outrageous prices for their firearms up here on Armslist, and Gander Mtn./other stores are picked over, making it difficult to get a new firearm. Please do not contact me with lowball offers. Like I said before, I am more interested in trading for specific firearms and am not in a rush to get rid of it. 

This is the exact model with more details and pics:

MAG5-60

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest.

This is much better ammo than the majority of junk others are posting.  They are trying to get 5 to 10 ten times what their average ammo is worth.  This is barely marked up for high quality ammo.

Message me number or email and lets meet San Antonio face to face. Ammo is scarce for AR15s right now. Can't find it anywhere online and this is good stuff.

Features and Benefits

5.56 NATO caliber
55 grains

This is high quality brass ammo for your AR-15. Don't spend a ton of money on an AR then skimp and get crap on the ammo. This is also re-loadable unlike all the steel crap most are selling and if there really is a ban this brass will be very valuable for reloading.

You will not find this in a shop here in town, and good luck finding an online vendor with it in stock. It will probably still have a 2-3 week wait, plus shipping, plus the FFL wait and fee. With an impending ban, just about every assault rifle and semiautomatic pistol is getting more hard to find and expensive. Get this NOW with nothing more than cash and a signature on a bill of sale.

First $400 cash gets it.

As a proper memorial to your service branch, patriotic symbols, inscriptions, and the founding date are deeply etched and 24-Karat Gold plated across the slide. The grips are of select wood and are custom-fitted to your pistol. Inset as the focal point of both grips are fired-enamel cloisonnés of the official symbol of your service branch.
Limited Edition; Fires .45 ACP.
Every gun is individually number.
There were only 2500 of this commemorative pistol made. This is #1580. 
JUST TO BE CLEAR, this is NOT a replica pistol, it is a fully functional standard issue military M1911A1 pistol made by Auto Ordnance. These commemorative .45s were made by Auto Ordnance and Colt, being commissioned by the American Historical Foundation. They sold in 1988 via mail special order for $2095. This is the Army commemorative, but they also made them for all branches of service.

It is in pristine condition. 
I would value this around $1500 cash or $2000 trade.
