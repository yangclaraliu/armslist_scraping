The rifle is in almost new condition.  There are a few very minor blemishes, mostly on the scope, from being carried in brushy terrain.  You'll have to look closely to see them but a blemish is a blemish.  It is about as lightly used gun as your likely to find though.  I haven't carried this rifle in the field in over ten years.  

I just don't hunt the type of terrain where I can see 200 yards much less shoot beyond that so lugging around a twelve pound rifle that blows hat sized holes through deer at typically bow shot range proved not to make a lot of sense to me.  

This rifle is an absolute blast to shoot!  Pun intended.  With the muzzle break on the recoil is in the .270 Winchester range.  Even girls can shoot it.  The concussion from the muzzle blast can be felt by bystanders 20 feet away so it's always a crowd favorite and the biggest conversation piece at the range.  You can also prank the ""tough guys"" by taking the muzzle break off.  This rifle slams into your shoulder like a 416 Rigby without the muzzle break on.   

The rifle comes with a Leupold Vari-X III 3.5-10X50 scope, padded thumbhole sling, and comes with reloading components.  I have the shell holder, dies, two pounds of unopened powder, a couple hundred controlled expansion bullets, and 38 empty cases with 2 loaded rounds of ammo.

I purchased this rifle brand new in 1997!  Serial # under 600 for the Accumark production run.  This rifle has some collectable value right now and will have serious collectable value in the future.  I was on a waiting list several months for Weatherby to manufacture my rifle.

The Accumark in .30-378 is still the same today as it was when introduced in 1997.  It features the same 28"" fluted barrel with muzzle break and the same aluminum bedded synthetic stock.  The only thing a new rifle has is a much higher serial number and a much higher price.

The Weatherby Accumark currently retails for $2100 and the scope costed $600 out the door.  As a general rule used late model guns in excellent condition sell for about half of retail.

I'm asking $1000 for the rifle alone or $1300 for the rifle, scope, sling combo.  I'll toss about $400 worth of reloading components into the deal.

198,http://www.armslist.com/posts/754198,For Sale:  Smith & Wesson M&P 15 300 aac Blackout,"Northwest, Wichita, Kansas","$ 1,800","Listed On: Monday, January 7, 2013",Rifles,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,30 Carbine                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Advanced Armament Corp. 300 AAC Blackout (300BLK). This system was developed to launch 30 caliber projectiles from the AR platform without a reduction in magazine capacity and compatible with the standard bolt. 

Full power 115-125 grain ammunition matches the ballistics of the 7.62x39mm AK, and eclipses 5.56mm with much higher-mass projectiles for a more dramatic effect on the target. Or choose subsonic cartridges for optimal use with a sound suppressor - 220 grain Sierra OTM (open-tip match) bullets vastly outperforms a 9mm MP5-SD in penetration and long range accuracy. 

Ammo and brass prices are low - Remington 115 grain UMC ammo is $12.99 a box MSRP - and it is not bare bones. It has waterproofed primers, crimped and cannelured open-tip match bullets, and a low-drag design.

At 300 meters, 300 BLK has 16.7% more energy than 7.62x39mm. Max effective range, using M4 military standards for hit probability, is 440 meters for a 9 inch barrel, and 460 meters for a 16 inch barrel. 300 BLK from a 9 inch barrel has the same energy at the muzzle as a 14.5 inch barrel M4, and about 5% more energy at 440 meters - even though the barrel is much shorter.

For hunting - think of it as like a 30-30 but from an AR. After you are done, you can remove your 5-round magazine and put in a 30 for plinking or home defense. For ammo, Remington has you covered with the Premiere AccuTip 125 grain. Want industry-wide support? Over 60 companies have already announced or sell products.

Due to the high efficiency of the cartridge, less powder is used than 5.56mm, which results in a rifle that is a comfortable to shoot - even with a short barrel. 

Reloading dies available from Forster products, Reamers and headspace guages available from Pacific Tool and Gauge.

If you're reading this I assume you're familiar with the top quality product offered by the Arsenal-modified Izmash rifle--and how they are impossible to get at this time. This is a Russian rifle, made in the same factory as the issue AK-74 carried by Russian soldiers. Next to your run of the mill AK, this gun is a diamond in the rough. I recommend reading this link to learn about this weapon: bit.ly/ViZJq4.

I have fired this rifle at 4 or 5 range outings. It has normal wear and tear, but is in perfect working condition and will be for generations.

Package includes:
Gun; 4 tapco and 2 Bulgarian polymer mags; about 3,000 rounds of surplus ammo; soft case; sling; Butt Stock AK-74 cleaning tool from K-Var; .22 and 12 gauge Bore Snakes; bayonette; and US Palm Grip (in addition to stock grip).

K-Var is listing this gun for $950 new--the only problem is they can't be acquired anywhere online (to my knowledge). It seems the same is true with the spam cans and hi-cap mags. With all things accounted for I have about $1,900 into this gun.

I have for sale or trade an RRA National Match 2 stage trigger, a set of M4 Handguards, M4 collapsible stock for commercial buffer tube and a basic AR pistol grip.  The trigger has been installed but never fired, shows a couple of marks from testing but nothing is defective.  The trigger should give a nice 3.5 to 4 pound two stage trigger pull, very hard to find and a little pricey if you can find it in stock.  I have two of them so no need for another!  The other parts are all take-offs from a Stag Arms factory rifle.  No defects, maybe a small scratch, only were on the rifle for about three hours after it was bought.  Make that replica M4 with parts that are getting harder and harder to find!  Make me an offer!  I'm willing to trade for ammo, pump shotgun and handguns.

This is a great multipurpose firearm for Georgia residents, as it can easily be converted to a short barreled rifle with a tax stamp, or be an excellent truck gun. Since it is technically a pistol as it hasn't been converted, you can leave this fully loaded in your vehicle, without a Georgia Weapons License. As an SBR build, it's considerably more desirable than other AK pistols, as it is fully assembled in Romania and imported intact. I saw these going for about $1500 on average last weekend at the gun show with no magazines (they were $50/each), so I priced this to sell. As it is technically a pistol, buyer must be 21 years old.

Just check around, people are getting a lot more than this for them right now.  With my prices and a little of your time, you can easily build a complete AR-15 for under $850).  This is a whole lot better than the crazy $1500-$4000 some are asking for their AR-15's that they paid under $1000 for New.  These will be worth two to three times as much if a ban is imposed.

I have two Consecutive Serial Numbered PSA Stripped Lower Receivers that I am putting up for sale ($300 each plus $15 if shipped)

I also have 2 New in Wrapper PSA complete lower parts kits for sale ($110 each plus $10 if shipped)

The lowers are brand new/never assembled and are the bullet pictogram models. You know what these look like. I have built 6 of these and all are top quality.

They are only getting harder to find each day I have found. These are the important parts you need in the event a ban comes down. All other parts are not regulated by BATF.

I can do a FTF in Central KY (near Elizabethtown) or ship to you. 

Payment can either be discreet paypal (if fees you pick them up), MO, or CASH. 
If lowers are shipped, they must go to a FFL dealer that I can verify. 

These are listed online for sale as well.

Thanks"

452,http://www.armslist.com/posts/754452,For Sale:  INTERESTED IN AMMO GROUP BUY ON CONTAINER OF AMMO FROM CANADA?,"Northwest United States, Portland, Oregon","$ 9,999","Listed On: Wednesday, December 26, 2012",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here is the deal. I have an FFL dealer I buy from, he is older and has trouble hearing. 90 Yr. WWII Marine Veteran. While looking for wholesale sources for .223/556 and 7.62X39 for him (me) I discovered a company in Canada that gets large quantities of surplus and other ammo. The catch is that they mostly do not ship to the USA except for VERY large amounts. They supply to midway to give you an idea. I felt very comfortable with the guy I spoke with on the phone. He said that basically to do a deal you have to submit a special import/export hazardous materials thing. The fee for that application is around $300 and it takes 3-6 weeks to be approved or not. So, I got this crazy idea that maybe normal people and even some smaller dealers could band together and make a large purchase like this. I am willing to facilitate and organize this. Why? Because the price of ammo is pissing me off, and I fear ammo is where the gun hating commies may try to hit us the hardest. So, this is an initial broadcast just to see if there is ANY interested in doing something like this. I have no idea how I would be able to prove to anyone its legitimate other than providing the info of my gunsmith, but really that will only prove he is a legitimate FFL; in reality I would be the one handling it. I have an email to my contact there in Canada, to narrow down more just exactly HOW big we are talking, to make something like this happen. Obviously, with the fees involved, we would have to make it worth while so we could all get good per round prices. That may be as much as a 1/2 to whole container. If you are in a hurry, this is not for you. If you are planning to spend less than $1000 on this, its not for you. Im just guessing with those numbers, but I am confident the amount we are talking about will be significant. As I get people who show interest I will create a facebook page, google cirlce, or maybe just a plain old email list. UPDATE: 1/8 FFL has agreed to help me out with this by using his FFL on the application."

(Heckler & Koch GmbH of Oberndorf, Germany)

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Features & System Characteristics:
•	Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
•	Grooved target triggers
•	Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
•	Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
•	Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
•	One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel (Stainless steel slide)
•	No snag, bobbed hammer
•	Flared recurve trigger guard
•	Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines
•	Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
•	Ambidextrous magazine release lever
•	Contoured, extended slide release
•	Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator
•	Patented Lock-Out Safety device
•	Includes a Fobus paddle holster and hard carrying case.
•	Suggested Retail Price $1,086 (.45 ACP DA/SA with control lever)"

Some call it an AK-47, others call it a Kalashnikov.  This rifle started life as a Russian built AK chambered in the .223 Rem/5.56 nato.  I repeat, this does not shoot the 7.62 X39 ammo.  It shoots the AR-15/M-16 ammo.  These are the same guns Krebs & Arsenal start with to build their custom guns.  I have shot a few of their “$2000 Dream Guns” and I was not that impressed, so I decided to build my own.  Two years and two dozen guns later I have this platform.  I feel this is the best AK/ Kalashnikov style rifle money can buy.  Here are a few of the add ons:

This gun has been professionally painted using Duracoat paint products (OD Green).   She is a heavy rifle that shoots flawless!  This gun will fire steel or brass, 5.56 or .223.

From Kel Tec:The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3""."
