Less than 18000 original miles. Very nice bike. Removable, locking, hardbags. Mustang seat, aftermarket pipes and a few other details. Fenders are not original but i didnt wanna say custom be cause i believe
they are off a newer model shadow. You will have a hard time finding another 88 with this low of mileage and good condition. 
Not a perfect bike, but nice none the less.

The Good: low mileage, well taken care of, good tread on tires, room for 2 and power to boot (me and the wife together about 400 lbs(mostly me!), always gets looks, shines up great, and reliable.
I would ride this bike anywhere with no worries.

The Not really bad: Choke lever needs repaired but you can still fully work the choke. I noticed when taking pics that the left front fork (when sitting on bike) has a ring of dirt that tells me the fork seal has a slight seep.
And by next riding season probably the rear brake redone. That's pretty much it.

So, what do you have to trade for an AR-15 (with front hand grip and bipod, front/rear sights, and aim point) , 10 Mags, couple hundred rounds of ammo.

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788."

DESCRIPTION FROM SIG:
The SIG516 Patrol OD comes with a Magpul MOE stock, MOE pistol grip and a Pmag in Olive Drab. As with all SIG516 Patrol rifles, the OD Green uses the SIG SAUER innovative short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler. 

This system, along with the SIG SAUER proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of the only rifles to pass NATO’s “Over the Beach” test.

A 16” chrome-lined barrel is chambered in 5.56mm NATO and is surrounded by a free-floating M1913
quad rail. The top rail is optic-ready and includes Magpul MOE flip-up iron sights."

This one comes with two 12 round mags, safety lock, original carrying car and paperwork. I will throw in 12 rounds of expensive self defense hollow points for free.

You can get the gsg conversion kit to fix it and give it a different look. CDNNinvestments.com has it for 19.99 and it gives it the original MP5 look. However it never really bothered me it didnt change any of  functionality. I put a AIM sports Reflex sight on it that will be going with it.

I will not register my weapons should this bill be passed, as I do not believe it is the government’s right to know what I own.

+ 6.75% sales tax. Cash or check, cc + 2%, American Express +3%. All handgun purchases in the state of NC require a Pistol Purchase permit or a NC CHP.

Don't leave home without defense: Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.

To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.5mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

$150 for all or $60 per box I have said several at $175 for 3 so this new lowered price is only good through Friday.

This is high quality brass not steel ammo and is re-loadable so if there is a ban you can reload the brass!!! This is much better ammo than the majority of junk others are posting. They are trying to get 5 to 10 ten times what their average ammo is worth. This is barely marked up for high quality ammo.

Message me number or email and lets meet San Antonio face to face. Ammo is scarce for AR15s right now. Can't find it anywhere online and this is good stuff.

Features and Benefits

5.56 NATO caliber

This is high quality brass ammo for your AR-15. Don't spend a ton of money on an AR then skimp and get crap on the ammo. This is also re-loadable unlike all the steel crap most are selling and if there really is a ban this brass will be very valuable for reloading.

This is high quality brass not steel ammo and is re-loadable so if there is a ban you can reload the brass!!! This is much better ammo than the majority of junk others are posting. They are trying to get 5 to 10 ten times what their average ammo is worth. This is barely marked up for high quality ammo.

Message me number or email and lets meet San Antonio face to face. Ammo is scarce for AR15s right now. Can't find it anywhere online and this is good stuff.

Features and Benefits

5.56 NATO caliber
55 grains
150-round box


This is high quality brass ammo for your AR-15. Don't spend a ton of money on an AR then skimp and get crap on the ammo. This is also re-loadable unlike all the steel crap most are selling and if there really is a ban this brass will be very valuable for reloading.

The 9 mm USP SD is a more basic tactical model and is equipped with a threaded barrel and adjustable target sights.

This is an 1100.00 handgun brand new so if you want to lowball look elsewhere.  FTF in Ohio only, I will meet you within a reasonable distance in the Cleveland area."
