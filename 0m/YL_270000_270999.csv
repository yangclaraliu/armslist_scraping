With 3x magnification and a durable armored construction, the Vortex VMX3 magnifier can be used to quickly add precise, longer ranging ability to red dot type sights. The VMX3 is easy to use and does not require any special sight-in. Just zero-in the red dot scope as normal, then add the VMX3 behind the scope for the additional magnification.

The Swing Mount provides absolute co-witness height. Once mounted, a specialized cam on the Swing Mount allows you to swing and lock the VMX3 magnifier in place behind your red dot sight. Then, you can choose magnified or unmagnified views at will. The quick-detach design allows you to quickly add or remove the system from your rail with ease and without tools. Machined aluminum construction and hard-coat anodization make the Swing Mount one tough, lightweight accessory—for both right- and left-handed shooters.

I have a scoped Ruger 10/22 (black synthetic stock, blued barrel, ~$60 scope, nothing fancy but gets the job done) and a Hi-Point c9 that I'm willing to trade (one plus cash or both) if you're interested, or I can pay cash if the price is right. 

Holster wear is fine with me, just needs to function flawlessly and have been cared for.

This is a very nice piece, it just doesn’t fit in my collection so my loss could be your gain. Less than 50 rounds through this (it isn't cheap to shoot) so it is very clean and not even broke in yet. This was built with a YHM lower, ACE skeleton stock, Alexander Arms upper w/ full auto bolt. Comes with 2 mags (7 & 10 round I think). Looking for around $1200 cash/trade. Most interested in Colt Snake guns in .38/.357 (SS, 4” or less barrel), will consider all reasonable offers.

FTF in the greater Tampa Bay area, valid FL DL &/or CWP. No felons, no crazies. No cretins/low ballers/kitchen table dealers/people who want something for nothing, if you can find it cheaper then go do so. Will ship to the lower 48 states for $40 from my FFL to your FFL."

It is overall in excellent shape. The rifle saw hunting use and so shows wear to the stock, and 2-3 dings in the finish. Otherwise it is perfect

Round count is estimated at less than 100 and possibly less than 50 based on slide wear. There is almost no finish wear other than the couple dings and a bit on the muzzle. 

The wear on the stock is limited to finish failure. There are no dings or scratches in it.

The internal parts are all like new with little wear or use as evidenced by the lack of slide wear in the picture

The scope does not have the rubber eye piece and is missing the bulb. These are both availble from Kalinka optics for about $25. The lenses could be cleaned but do not appear scratched.

Overall the rifle is in excellent condition. As stated the rifle was hunted with. The plus side is that the round count is low, the downside is that it is not in perfect cosmetic shape. Comes exactly as shown.

I also have a recent FFL purchase you can look into if you want verification of my FBI back round check. I just want to keep it squeaky clean. As far as condition....I am looking for high quality. No scratches, low amount of rounds fired etc... I keep my guns clean and oiled. So I am picky when it comes to how a person kept their gun.

This is a model '94, 38-55 with a short magazine. Serial number 387440 was manufactured March 4th, 1908. Even though the tang sight looks original to the gun (and it may have been put on the gun in 1908), the sight is approximately 20-years older than the gun is. I am intimately familiar with the early production Lyman tang sights (I collect them). The sight on your Model 1894 is the type found on the early Model 1873, 1876 and 1885 rifles. Those early sights are worth a fair bit more $$$ than the later ones. 
Another thing you have going for it on value is that the round barrels were made for only 1 out of 11 of these types of rifles.

I have one fired one Pmag full of 55gr through this weapon since new. The rifle alone is over $1400.00. This is not your typical M4, but a superior Colt match target which means better quality parts straight from assembly like heavier barrel, Factory Muzzle Brake, better fore grips. 

Now for the best part. This rife has several hundred dollars in MAGPUL items like CTR buttstock, Trigger guard, Single point Sling, 3 Brand new P-Mags with Ranger tabs. this weapon also has a magpul dual sling mount that cost over 50 bucks. 

On top of the flat picatinny rail is a brand new BSA sweet 223 6-18x tactical rifle scope. This scope is pre-caibrated for the 3 most common grain bullets used in M4's (50, 55, 62) It is set up right now and dialed in with 55 grain turret on the scope. 

Everything goes into a used but excellent condition Pelican full size case. The case alone would cost you over 200 dollars at any outdoors store. it is water proof and airplane legal. 

On the front of the weapon is a GPS or Grip pod system grip with built in spring loaded bipod. This is the exact bipod used by the Marine Corps on the M4 that are issued. They retail for about 159.00

Hogue soft pistol grip which is about ten times better feeling than the hard plastic grip that most M4's have. 

I hope this description makes it a littel easier to understand why Colt tactical rifles are not the most expensive but easily not dime a dozen either.

This is a high quality chest rig made by ATS tactical. It is 1000D nylon with 3 slots for M4 magazines and 2 side pouches. I also purchased the H-harness padded straps for it but the originals come with it as well. These sell for $115 new and the padded H-harness is another $30. I am letting it go for cheap because I just bought it and then decided to go the AK47 route so I have no need for a AR15 chest rig.

Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870™ – the new Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day.

Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.

Key Features:
Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable 
Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces 
SuperCell™ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54% 
Our softest-shooting pump gun ever 
Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics 
Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably 
Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels 
28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes
