It's fired approximately 500 rounds or so (flawlessly, I might add). This pistol is very accurate, consistent, and reliable. It's got all steel construction, a 4.75"" barrel, fixed front sight and windage adjustable rear sight; ambidextrous safety, magazine safety, and a loaded chamber indicator. 

Star 30M is a recoil operated, locked breech pistol, that uses Browning-designed, linkless locking (High Power-type), with two lugs on the barrel and shaped cam under the chamber that interacts with slide stop axis inside the frame. It features a double action trigger with slide mounted ambidextrous safety that blocks firing pin only, leaving trigger and hammer unaffected in ""safety on"" position.

Comes with one 15-rd magazine, case, and owners manual. Has internal slide rail system like the SIG P-210 and the ever-popular and proven CZ75. The all-steel construction makes for a fairly heavy pistol but it's built like a tank. The weight is well balanced and makes for very comfortable shooting, keeping felt recoil minimal and making it easy to keep on target.

Being a military pistol, it should have a long life. It was adopted by the Spanish Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force, the Guardia Civil, the National Police and others; as well as by Peruvian police, as their service pistol.

From what I've read, most everyone's who has parted with their 30M has suffered sellers' remorse. I may, too, as I know this is a very good quality pistol... I just don't have much use for it as all of my other pistols are .40's.

I buy them cheaply so that I can refurbish/straighten them for sale at local gun shows. My buddy has perfected a method of 
s-t-r-e-t-c-h-t-n-g illegal barrels to LEGAL length! I am particularly needing Browning A-5 and Remington 870 shortie barrels. Don't haul those old barrels to the dump! Let me pay you CA$H for them!
I also buy take-off stocks & fore ends that are discolored, scratched, etc. Jim Moffatt, Memphis, Tennessee. email: REDACTED or call REDACTED"

It has the original box with stickers, and the matching serial numbers. I have had my gunsmith also check this out (but not test-fire it) to make sure it is complete and in pristine condition. It has the original 30 round stainless magazine as well as a 50 round aftermarket magazine as well. I paid $575 for this and planned on keeping it for a long while, but am getting heavy on my pistol collection. These are no longer in production and have become extremely rare, with another ban on hi-cap mags, this will be even more of a rarity.

The Intratec TEC DC-9 ""assault pistol"", also known as DC-9, TEC-9, or, if manufactured after 1994, as AB-10, bears the dubious distinction of being one of the most widely used ""criminal"" guns in USA. It was used in several mass murder cases, as well as in unknown, but definitely large number of street fights and other violent crimes. TEC-9 became ""famous"" for its ""evil"" appearance, large magazine capacity (which offered significant firepower), and for low price. Unsurprisingly, these features made TEC-9 very popular among various marginal types. For any serious or professional shooter this gun vas of little value - it was too big and heavy to be carried comfortably, it was too unreliable when firing anything but FMJ ammunition, and the accuracy with very crude fixed sights was about marginal.
The TEC-9 design was started in Sweden, when the Interdynamic AB company of Stockholm developed a relatively simple submachine gun. Since Sweden was a poor market for such product, a subsidiary company Interdynamic was established in Miami (Florida, USA), to market Interdynamic guns in USA. As the full-automatic weapons market in USA is very restrictive, the basic submachine gun was converted in semi-automatic only variant, apparently suitable for civilian US market. This semi-automatic pistol, like its submachine gun predecessor, was a simple blowback design, firing from the open bolt. It was designated Interdynamic KG-9. But, sooner than later, US Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) found that this semiautomatic pistol can be easily converted back to full automatic, and restricted it manufacture. Interdynamic redesigned the KG-9 into ""closed bolt"" design by adding the separate striker, and designated it KG-99. About the same time (mid-1980s) the Interdynamic of USA turned into Intratec Firearms, Inc, based in the same city of Miami (Florida). Intratec initially  produced the KG-99 under the designation of  TEC-9, but about 1989 renamed it into DC-9. With the introduction of the infamous US Assault Weapons Ban in 1994 the Intratec pistols were prohibited for manufacture (but not for ownership, if made before the ban). Intratec subsequently slightly redesigned the basic design, dropping some ""assault"" features like the threaded barrel, barrel shroud, and forward pistol grip. In this ""post-ban"" version the pistol was manufactured and sold as AB-10 (AB stands for After Ban). The AB-10 pistols were sold with 10-round magazines, but still could accept both factory and aftermarket high capacity magazines from its predecessors, TEC-9 and DC-9. There were several manufacturers in US, who made copies of DC-9, such as AA Arms, which produced DC-9 look-alike AP-9 pistols. Like originals, AP-9 pistols were of cheap construction and marginal reliability.
The Interdynamics and Intratec pistols are blowback operated, semi-automatic weapons. The major difference between Interdynamic KG-9 and Intratec TEC-9/AB-10 line of pistols is that KG-9 fired from the open bolt, and had a fixed firing pin; the Intratec pistols fire from closed bolt, and have a separate firing pin and a massive striker, which interoperates with the sear. The receivers of all versions are made from steel tube (either carbon or stainless), the frames (or ""lower receivers"") are made from polymer, integral with pistol grip and magazine housing ahead of the trigger guard. The tubular receiver is hinged to the front of the frame. There is no manual safety. The open-bolt Interdynamic KG-9 pistols featured a special cut, in which the charging handle can be locked when bolt in retracted. The KG-99 and Interdynamic pistols have manual safety built into charging handle - to lock the bolt, one must push the charging handle inward. All pistols are fed from double stack, detachable box magazines; standard magazine capacity was 20 or 32 rounds for pre-ban guns, and 10 rounds for post-ban guns. After-market magazines were offered in various capacities up to 50 rounds. Permanently fixed open sights were not adjustable, and often misaligned. In the pre-ban TEC-9 and DC-9 versions these pistol accepted screw-on barrel extensions, which had purely cosmetic purposes, or silencers (which were illegal in many jurisdictions)."

In excellent shape - Blueing on the gun is still superb.

Wood, barrel, rifling all super clean

Gun cycles and shoot excellent.

Scope is ehhh.... 

Includes extra mag.

This is a deer hunting rifle, don't contact me thinking you are going to score a deal, take it to the next gun show, and sell it for 50% more than you bought it from me for. This is fair price for a 30-06 rifle that will kill a deer. Gun has little use and was well taken care of, it works excellent as a deer hunting rifle needs to. Please only contact me if you are a sportsman and actaully interested in owning the gun and not just a gun show table dealer. 

Thanks.

This is a HK91, imported by Springfield Armory with the name SAR-3, just prior to the AWB of '89. This gun was subject to the ban both by name, and by configuration.

Due to that ban, SAR-3's already awaiting customs clearance had to be reconfigured with thumbhole stocks, no flash hiders, and a few other changes. They also had to be re-stamped with a different name.

This was accomplished by having someone actually overstamp the ""3"" with an ""8"", BY HAND. That makes this particular gun pretty collectible, as only a couple of hundred exist in the pre-ban configuration.

That's what this is. Pre-ban configured, overstamped SAR-3.

The gun was made in HK's Greek factory, by HK technicians, on HK machines, using HK tools.

It's a HK91 in every single way but name.

It comes with three 20 round magazines and a HK factory sling.

The price is $2500 cash, or $3000 in trade, or some combination of the two.

Visa/MC/Discover accepted, with a 3% service fee.

As always, when you pay cash, I pay the sales tax.

Ruger SR-22, an autoloading rimfire rifle that combines the legendary
reliability and affordability of the Ruger 10/22 with the ergonomics and
configurability of the Ruger SR-556. The SR-22 Rifle places a standard
10/22 action inside a top quality, American Made, all aluminum chassis that
is custom manufactured to Ruger specs by Nordic Components, Inc. The final
product is an affordable, feature loaded rifle that faithfully replicates
the AR platform dimensions between the sighting plane, buttstock height,
and grip. Although it looks really cool out of the box, there is an
extensive array of accessories available allowing a custom configuration,
limited only by the shooter's preferences.

 IT INCLUDES A NEW BURRIS 3X12X40 SCOPE AND RINGS AND 300 RDS OF AMMO.

SP-101 3 IN BARREL STAINLESS SHAT MAYBE 20 TIMES. HAS MORE KNOCKDOWN THAN A 357 AND MORE PUNCH. ALSO HAVE 4 BOXES OF AMMO THAT GOES WITH IT.. READ BELOW ON THIS ROCKET       The new .327 Federal Magnum offers muzzle energy twice that of .38 Special +P loads, and velocities comparable to a 125-grain .357 Magnum, with 20 percent less recoil in its hottest version. Designed specifically for use in lightweight small-frame revolvers, the .327 Federal Magnum allows a six-round cylinder compared to five-round capacity for similar-sized .38 Special and .357 Magnum guns, with the added benefit of chambering .32 S&W, .32 Special, and .32 H&R Magnum loads as well. Based on a higher-pressure loading in a 1/8-inch longer .32 H&R case, the .327 Federal Magnum will initially be available in three versions: a Federal Premium 85-grain Hydra-Shok Low Recoil Personal Defense loading, an American Eagle 100-grain Jacketed Soft Point, and a Speer 115-grain Gold Dot.



From a 3 1/16-inch revolver, the 100-grain Soft Point .327 Magnum load develops 100 fps more velocity than a 125-grain .357 Magnum from a four-inch revolver, and delivers only 35 ft/lbs less energy. The recoil of the .327 Magnum 85-grain Personal Defense load is less than half the recoil of a 125-grain .357 Magnum. 



Subjected to the standard FBI protocol tests for effectiveness through barriers, the 115-grain .327 Magnum load reaches 15 inches in bare gelatin, 16 inches through heavy clothing, 16 inches through plywood, 14.5 inches through wallboard, 13 inches through auto glass, and 20 inches through single-layer vehicle body steel--all with substantial bullet upset ranging from .40 caliber (steel) to .60 caliber (auto glass)."

https://www.riflesonly.com/pro-shop/tactical-gear/tab-gear-sling.html

Product description:
There are 3 elements to this very basic sling: the sling loop up front, the center to adjust the carry length, and the rear of the sling which also serves as support for the non-firing hand to use in place of a rear bag.
The front is simply used to shoot slung up. This can be done connected to the rest of the sling or not. It has a slider that can move very easily to lock down the loop on the shooters arm.
The center is where the shooter adjusts the sling for the carry length. It can be removed and connected to itself for easy storage allowing the remaining two sections of the sling to attach like a carry strap with shooting loop still in place. The reasons for the two buckles are two fold. First is allows the shooter to get out of the sling quickly because regardless of how you sling your rifle there is an accessible buckle you can unclip in order to get the rifle into action quickly. Second it is designed to allow the removal of a rifle from an injured soldier or person incase he is incapacitated.
The rear section of the sling has a 5"" section of three layers of webbing triple stitched together and is stiff enough to use as a hasty rear support.

It's a pretty cool set up and offers heavy duty protection at a bargain price. (pictured below showing the panels and hard plate)

5. Pair of two, Natick Laboratories, Vintage US ARMY Issue, Ground Troop Vests. They must have been stored but never issued because they are in awesome shape! This is the Viet Nam issue nylon and vinyl composition with an OD green soft shell. It is rated as a FRAG vest without the ballistic plates (which i do NOT have) but has the carrier pockets for plates or soft panels. Both are sized Large Long. I wear a standard XL and they fit me fine and are actually a comfortable vest with a very soft feel rather than the stiffness of most ""flak"" type vests.

ALL for $300

*The vests are still for sale or trade. I have had multiple ""buyers"" back out or disapear after making a ""deal"". I will not let them go for nothing because they are worth a great deal! I just need to offload some gear before my wife offloads me! lol  I prefer to meet face to face in Central Indiana but am open to discuss options. To answer the next popular question; i WILL ship them. Once your payment + shipping cost clears I will send the items."

I have up for trade my gently used Glock 23C. I've carried this gun for about a year now, and must say it is very light and perfect for concealed carry. Gun shoots great, and was always cleaned after being shot. I have put about 200 rounds down the pipe. Gun has VERY light holster wear near barrel on left side, you can only see it if you're looking for it. very few blems, gun looks very good and is in perfect working order. Comes with original Glock case, 3 13 round magazines (1 has a +2 extension on it) original paperwork, but I no longer have the factory spent casing or lock. I am also tossing in a very nice holster which can either be worn on a belt or as a paddle, It's a Blackhawk Serpa concealed holster in carbon fiber finish. I will also include any ammo I have for it, which will be at least a magazine of Horton critical defense ammo.

I am open to a number of different trades. I am looking for a 1911 (will take a look at any model) or other .45's. I will accept rifle trades as well, larger caliber only please (no .22's unless it's .223). It never hurts to ask, but I'm not looking for anything beat up or worth a quarter of the price of the Glock either. I would also take a nice AR15 upper, or other AR parts, let me know what you have.

I also have a DPMS A2 AR15 I am willing to trade with this Glock for a nicer gun, mostly looking for long distance rifles or assault rifles."

Overview:

Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870™ – the new Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day.

Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.
Key Features:

    * Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable
    * Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces
    * SuperCell™ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54%
    * Our softest-shooting pump gun ever
    * Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics
    * Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably
    * Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels
    * 28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes
    * Sling swivel studs built-in
    * Includes Modified Rem Choke"
916,http://www.armslist.com/posts/116916,For Trade:  ART Dual 15 Band Equalizer NEW!,"west, Asheville, North Carolina",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, March 28, 2011",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Manufacturer's Description for ART Dual 15 Band Equalizer (Model 341)
ART's 341 Dual-Channel, 15-band, 2/3-octave graphic equalizer features: constant Q circuitry with a 3% center frequency accuracy, 20mm center detent sliders, selectable boost/cut range of 6dB or 12dB, active balanced and unbalanced input and output connections, variable input level control, clip level indicators, ground lift switch, internal power supply, and selectable line voltage switch. A range control switch is provided allowing you to set the maximum boost or cut for each band of equalization to either 6dB or 12dB. Each channel has its own bypass switch with LED indicator. The rugged, all-steel constructed chassis occupies 1U rack space and is intended for installation in standard 19"" equipment racks.

Multiple input and output configurations are provided for ease of use and incorporate paralleled connections. The XLR and 1/4"" TRS connectors use active balanced, low noise circuitry. XLR connections are: Pin 1 = ground, Pin 2 = Hot (+), and Pin 3 = Cold (-). The 1/4 inch TRS connections are: Tip = Hot (+), Ring =Cold (-), and Sleeve = ground. Both the XLR and 1/4"" connectors may be used in an unbalanced configuration. The RCA jacks are unbalanced. The 341 is designed to work with a variety of signal levels. The input level control covers a wide range and can easily accommodate -10 and +4 signal levels. A clip LED will light when a signal level of 5dB before clipping occurs.

The 341 may be used in a variety of applications such as live sound, recording studios, instrument racks as well as any conventional fixed installation environment. Use the 341 equalizer wherever modification of the frequency contour of a sound is needed. The 341 graphic equalizer is a powerful tool for solving a number of audio problems and creating interesting sound textures. Patch the EQ between your mixing console and power amps to allow you to alter the overall mix to better match your environment. Use the 341 between your monitor mixer and monitor power amps to aid in the removal of feedback inducing frequencies. Patch into a channel insert to EQ one channel or track individually. Run your instrument directly into the equalizer to enhance its sound before reaching a power amplifier or instrument amplifier. Patch the 341 into the effects loop of an instrument amplifier or between a preamp and power amp to have precise control over the complete sound.

The 341 Dual 15 Band EQ has the features and performance you need for any of your audio applications requiring equalization.
