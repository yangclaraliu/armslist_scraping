Browning Citori 425 Sporting Clays Grade I in 12 gauge with 28‚Äù factory ported barrels and Invector Plus screw-in chokes.  I believe that there are at least 5 to 7 different chokes included with this great shotgun.  It has had a trigger job completed by Briley to replace the inertia based trigger with a mechanical trigger in order to allow for the use of the sub-gauge tubes.  (GUN IS SOLD PENDING FUNDS - TUBE SETS STILL FOR SALE)

I also have two very lightly used sets of Briley Companion Tubes that can be inserted into this gun (or any other Browning w/ IV+ chokes) to allow the shooting of sub-gauge shells.  The tube sets are in 20 gauge and 28 gauge and also have screw-in choke capabilities (the Tube Sets each include a pair of ""Skeet"" chokes).  Additional $500 Per Set.

Not currently interested in trades.  Reasonable Cash Offers may be considered.  This is a great sporting shotgun with a lot of capability in the skeet, trap and sporting clays arena.  It has been well cared for and the Tube Sets are only a year old and are in like new condition.

Pictures available upon request."

This G27 is a late Gen 2.5 (circa 1998) ... I've added a frame plug and a new OEM recoil spring (the original is fine really - a routine maintenance thing to make myself feel better). There is a little wear on the slide, nothing way out of sorts. I thought about refinishing but, I can't predict your taste, so I'll leave that to you if you so desire.

Includes 2x 9rnd mags with standard floorplates.

I've put about 50 thru it - it feels just as it should, and puts the rounds where you intend.

Given it's age, I fully expect to put some cash into a trade for a 23gen4 - how much? Let's talk!

As for cash offer, I'm listening - past a refinish job on the slide (about $75-100), this weapon is in fantastic shape and very clean, so lowballers can step aside, please, or be prepared to be ignored.

Traders/Buyers should have a IN DL to verify residency, please. Your privacy is assured - just need to prove you live here. I'll show the same."

Capable of monitoring and reporting an exhaustive list of environmental parameters ‚Äì from temperature to barometric pressure, dewpoint, wind chill, and more**, the Kestrel 4500 is the most feature-rich pocket weather meter in the entire Kestrel catalog. And now, the Kestrel 4500, as well as the entire Kestrel 4000 series, is available with Bluetooth Technology, allowing you to communicate wirelessly and transmit and log your data automatically.

 ‚Ä¢Digital Compass
‚Ä¢Wind Direction
‚Ä¢Crosswind
‚Ä¢Headwind / Tailwind



These added features make the 4500 the Kestrel Meter of choice for military professionals, HAZMAT teams, and flight crews. Like all the pocket weather meters in the Kestrel 4000 series, the Kestrel 4500 is capable of storing and charting up to 1400 data points for later analysis. 



If you select the Bluetooth model, your meter includes custom communication software designed to quickly and easily configure your data transmission frequency, download logged data, graph data and transfer data to other applications. It is not longer to purchase an interface separately, the new Kestrel Meters with Bluetooth include the software necessary to communicate wirelessly at a range of up to 30-feet.

Our Henry Varmint Express¬Æ packs eleven .17HMR rounds in its tubular magazine. It features a 20"" barrel, comes with a checkered American walnut Monte Carlo stock. Like all lever action Henrys, the action is incredibly smooth from the very first shot. It will enable small game and varmint hunters to take full advantage of the .17HMR with regard to velocity, trajectory, wind drift, richochet resistance, quietness and accuracy.

Already considered by many to be the most accurate rimfire cartridge ever produced, the .17HMR incorporates a .17 caliber bullet into a necked-down .22 magnum case. This high-powered combination produces a sizzlin' muzzle velocity of up to 2,550 feet per second and the laser-flat trajectory makes it lethal for long-range shots on woodchucks, prairie dogs, foxes and other small varmints. Henry's take on this revolutionary caliber, the Varmint Express, has a 20"" barrel that delivers dead-on accuracy.

Just like all Henry rifles, it's handcrafted in the United States using only high-grade components such as a checkered American walnut stock, and Williams Fire sights and, of course, it's outfitted with that legendary, smooth-operating lever action that sets a Henry rifle apart from all the imitators.

Hi, I‚Äôm selling my used Beretta 92A1 9mm handgun. This firearm is in excellent shape, bought it last summer and have only fired ~500 rounds through it. Previous owner installed an ELITE hammer and a D Spring (Both factory Beretta parts). 
I‚Äôm getting ready to move and I‚Äôm trying to free up some cash.

The 92A1 is an improved 92 series and differs from the common 92fs in that the 92A1 has removable front and rear sights, a captured guide rod spring, a frame rail and a frame buffer (to extend frame life) and a differently shaped trigger guard.

This gun shoots straight and has very little recoil.

This package will include:

An excellent condition Beretta 92A1 (made in Italy)

Two 17 round magazines

Factory Hard Case and Cardboard outer box

Factory manuals

Beretta ‚ÄúCup‚Äù - (Used to keep gun from moving inside box)

Beretta Elite hammer and D Spring installed (reduces trigger pull weight)

These guns are $650 locally, and over $600 online. I‚Äôm asking $575, no taxes, no FFL transfer fees and no hassle. CASH ONLY. I will require a copy of your MO Drivers License and we will complete a bill of sale.

Feel free to call around and check prices and you will see this is a great deal.

 All 100% German made gun,100% reliable you can expect from Sig Sauer (sorry,i have to correct some,the Sigs been made after 2003 at Exeter N.H all suck,i have P239 and P229,all in 9 mm,both came back to factory for repair,not once-TWICE,i got rid both and lost much money) .Believe me or not,because this gun is discontinued,the price will be up in future,because this is a 100% German made,who have them,the serious collectors won't sell them ever,specially with two-tone model like this one,i bet you won't find it anywhere. Now, you just found one for sale(because i'm not a serious collector.Ha,,Ha.LOL)

I rate the finish on the gun about 95% like new. Remember,this gun was make in 1999(13 years ago). Sitting around all time,didn't shoot much. 

Just put the Truglo night sight on recently ,which fiber optic and tritium inserted,this combination give you the same sight picture both daylight and night. This sight costs me $129(damn,sometimes i thought it made by gold,to expensive) I love this sight a lot,i have the original sights which came with the gun,too. Box,manual,2 recoil springs, 5 brand new grip washers (Sig's grips compatible) and 3 mags(Sig's mag isn't cheap,$45/each)

Just want to make it clear,nothing's wrong with this gun to force me selling it. All i want is pocket carry and the North American Arms NAA Guardian .32ACP is my "" Guardian "" right now. It will serve me as long as i'm still alive, until...i die or it's...stolen. Lol :-)

I posted the gun for sale once and i got a serious buyer, who wants to trade mine for his rare Ruger Mini14 stainless made a long time ago ( 1987 or ???) with $300 cash. He is one of nicest buyers who i've been contacted with, but...then, i decided not to trade because i love this gun so much, i can't live without it. And took the post off Armslist. Now, it's back. 

This is what i believe the best compact .45ACP ever made base on factors:  all metal made, fires .45ACP-firepower proven with little recoil (easy get back to target quickly after the 1st shot), compact grip for conceal carry but still feel comfortable in hand, accuracy, safe, reliability, durability, brand name, second strike option(DA/SA) if the primer is bad, easy to take down without tools to clean, ...I'm confident 100% to trust my life on this particular handgun. Don't believe me, bring the ammo, go to the range with me, i'll let you shoot it by all the positions you want. If the gun's malfunctioned by any kind, i'll give you $100.00 plus i'll pay you back the ammo. If it's eat anything and so accurate as tack-driver, no malfunctions occur, you lose your ammo and just give me $50.00 for my time.Ha...Ha Wanna gamble, guys...?????

This was part of a batch of 84s pre-ban rifles that got caught by customs right in the middle of the assault weapons ban so this poor little rifle had a muzzle nut screwed on the threads and a bishop mfg thumbhole stock added to make it into the states. Gun is in pristine condition, perfectly threaded muzzle, perfect bluing, perfect bright shiny bore, no scratches scrapes or dings anywhere. These are the highest quality most desirable AK-47 style rifles in the world. Change the stock set out, screw on a muzzle break of your choice and have the AK-47 that everyone wishes they had!

Bob is best known as the Handgun Editor for Guns and Ammo Magazine, but Bob loved rifles, too...especially Winchester Model 70's. I traded Bob out of this rifle in 1992, about a year before he passed away, and it has been in my safe ever since. The rifle is 95 -98%, with none of the usual safe dings and retains 99% of the original bluing. The stock is beautifully figured Black Walnut with cut checkering and a special order hand-rubbed lacquer finish, and there isn't a mark or ding on it anywhere. The rifle has spent the past 50 plus years in a gun safe and is still in near new condition. The bore is clean and crisp and the gun has not been fired much, and not at all since it has been in my collection. This rifle also has a rare barrel stamp that makes it a ""must have"" for any Winchester collection. Please email me for photos. Comes with the original Winchester leather sling, and Bob's fixed 4x Weaver scope and one piece mount."

A minimal number of parts and a clean-running piston system add up to a low-maintenance design with increased reliability. The piston operated system keeps heat and fouling out of the receiver, which means less time cleaning and more time putting bullets where they need to go. Cooler parts last longer, cooler guns run longer. REC7 was made to run hard. The 17-4 stainless piston transferring energy to the bolt carrier is the most robust in the industry. Its hardened one piece piston is superior to multi-component designs. The bolt carrier, machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel features an integral piston strike face - no separate gas key to shoot loose and another industry first.

My copy does in fact have around 500 rounds through it with no malfunctions of any kind, which is no small feat for ANY of the micro-compacts on the market.  It's in great condition, with just the tiniest bit of lightening of the slide finish at a couple places to indicate it's been carried--hardly noticeable.  Otherwise it looks brand new.

The guide rod and springs have been recently replaced, and I have 3 mags, all with +1 baseplates as well as the original floorplates.  I have 4 premium holsters, all in great condition: Uncle Mike's ankle, Blackhawk inside-the-pocket, Galco leather inside-the-wiaistband, and Fobus paddle.  You can have it all.

Also, I have the original receipt, which you can take with you (Kel-Tec firearms all come with a lifetime warrantee.).  You get the case, all the paperwork, everything that came with it.

$225 for the gun and 1 mag.
$260 for the gun and 2 extra mags
