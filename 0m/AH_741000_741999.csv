This is an all metal big boy replica .22 rifle. No plastic aside from the 416 style adjustable buttstock. 

Got this to review in the summer. Reviewed it, bought an extra extended mag for it, cleaned it, put it away. Essentially the .22 Long Rifle version of the HK 416 carbine manufactured FOR Umarex, USA BY Carl Walther in Germany. I've added some hard rubber rail covers as the quad rail can be abrasive, bought the extra magazine (30 rounder, the one that came with was a 20), and it's also wearing a Surefire G2 with a Mission First Tactical quick detach light mount I'll include in the trade.

Also for consideration I have a Nikon P-22 AR specific optic with rapid action turrets AND the proprietary Nikon P-22 raised AR scope mounts that go with it. Rock solid setup and outstanding accuracy during testing on this rifle. This addition to the package would remove the stipulation for cash added on my end in the trade. I'm flexible, but let's be reasonable. 

This rifle is ridiculously accurate at 50 yards and beyond and in 1300 rounds to date I've had ZERO failures related to the rifle. Only recalcitrant rounds via Federal bulk pack. Among a dozen brands of ammo run through the rifle has never failed. H&K style diopter battle sights are zeroed at 50 and cowitness perfectly with your optic. I ran a budget rate Sightmark red dot and they were perfect for each other.

Lots of pics and video shooting it on my full review here:

Barrel: A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.

Barrels are finished off with a taper pinned, f-marked, front sight post, standard handguards, and an A2 flash hider.

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.

Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

Want to learn more about the BOSS System .. watch this You Tube Video - http://youtu.be/GQGI6HYsTBU 

This rifle I have for sale has less than 80 rounds fired thru it .. I bought it some years back ( about 1993-94 ) for my wife .. and she went hunting ONE TIME .. the rest is history - been locked up ever since. It's too nice and too much of a rifle for my 15 yr old son, so I want to sell it. 

Does not include any scope - just in case one is shown in a stock photo I might use. 

The Tech stuff: 

Receiver. The Safari model uses a one-piece ordnance steel receiver that is richly blued with scroll engraving and is drilled and tapped for scope mounts. The bolt release lever is incorporated into the receiver.

Stock and Forearm. The fluted stock design incorporates a full pistol grip with an undercut and is contoured for use with open sights or a scope. The forearm is full and hand-filling. LongTrac and ShortTrac stocks are shim adjustable for cast on/off and drop. Sling swivel studs are installed in the stock and forearm.

Safety. Crossbolt design with enlarged head. Trigger. Short, smooth, single-stage pull. The trigger assembly can be easily removed for maintenance and cleaning. Enlarged trigger guard.

Magazine. Detachable box magazine with a unique hinged floorplate.

Action. The BAR is a gas-operated autoloader with an extra strong, multiple-lug rotating bolt that locks directly into the barrel. Every cartridge that is loaded into the chamber of the BAR is surrounded by a recessed bolt face, which is encircled by the barrel and then surrounded by the receiver. Three complete rings of steel surround the cartridge. A seven-lug bolt and precise breech-to-chamber relationship give the BAR exceptional accuracy and the strength to handle magnum loads. The strong and very rigid action bar/inertia block link-up improves accuracy by reducing barrel vibration. The buffering system reduces wear and stress on the rifle's mechanism.

BOSS®. The Ballistic Optimizing Shooting System (BOSS) is available as an option on BAR Safari rifles. The BOSS allows the shooter to fine tune the rifle's accuracy to surpass that of any other autoloader.

Barrel. Individually machined from hammer-forged, heat-treated billets of steel.

Buyers using Paypal will incur additional 3.0 percent fee added to total ( that's what they charge me ) 

Shiping Cost is $ 40.00 ( includes $ 1200.00 insurance ). 




Bottom Line is this .. gun is ""like new"" .. but it ain't because it's been out in the field before. : It's a very nice Browning BAR Mark II Safari 7mm Rem. Magnum Semi-Auto Rifle with BOSS. 22"" blue-steel barrel with BOSS (ballistic optimizing shooting system) accurizing adjustable assembly on barrel muzzle, blue-steel engraved receiver - NO SCOPE - Base and Rings included.. no iron sights, stainless-steel bolt, blue-steel bolt handle, crossbolt safety, gold-plated trigger, trigger guard with gold-etched Buck Mark, checkered glossy walnut stock and forearm, Browning rubber recoil pad, (2) sling swivels / no sling, One (1) detachable magazine. No box, no papers. The Serial number is 107NW15257

The top of the line Safari model has an engraved, forged steel receiver and a genuine walnut stock and forearm with generous areas of diamond pattern cut checkering. All metal surfaces are highly polished and deep luster blued, and the wood has a beautiful high gloss finish. 
The BAR Mark II Safari is a handsome and deadly autoloading hunting rifle. I consider it to be, as Browning advertises, ""The best there is."" .. that's why I bought it .. 

What is the BOSS?
Browning's Ballistic Optimizing Shooting System (BOSS) is a patented breakthrough in rifle accuracy. When any rifle is fired, the barrel goes through a series of vibrations as the bullet leaves the muzzle. The variations of these vibrations greatly affect the accuracy of the rifle. Controlling these vibrations will greatly control the accuracy of the rifle. Browning's BOSS allows you to control the vibrations of your barrel so you can shoot groups you didn't think possible.

How the BOSS works.
The BOSS simply tunes the vibrations of your barrel. This allows the bullet to leave the barrel the split second it is stationary. Your BOSS manual has a list of settings for each caliber and bullet weight. Adjusting your BOSS to these ""Sweet Spot"" settings allows you to find the instant your barrel is stationary. The result is accuracy never achieved before by an out-of-the-box rifle."

Now, I personally built this rifle part-by-part.  It's been assembled using professional AR tools, grease and torque specs.  Its a shooter, and doesn't FTF or FTE.  It's cleaned after every outing.  It eats both brass, and steel-cased, any ammo I've thrown at it.  It shoots the Wal-mart Russian Tul Ammo without a hickup.  It has less than 500 rounds through it.  If you're still reading this ad and have the cash in hand at this point, here are the details:

I have here a brand new Law Enforcement 6920 made by Colt's Defense. This is brand new in the box and cellophane and is from the assault weapon ban era. As you can see this has the ""Restricted Military/ Government Law Enforcement/ Export Use Only"" banner on it. This is when the only way you could get one was to be military or LE with a letterhead. As you can see it still has the shipping oil all over it and the paper down the bore. It comes with the accessory pack which has the two Colt 20 rd mags, sling, chamber brush, manuals etc. The buttstock is the Colt collapsable stock not the new Magpul which makes it more of a rarity this day in age. The Upper is a A3 which means it comes with the removable carry handle and has the Picatinny rail underneath for optics or accessories. The pictures should speak for themselves as to what a pristine specimen this is! Now is your last chance to own such an example of this with the banner! With the push for the enactment of another ban the price on these is only going to drive the price on this investment piece further up. Bid with confidence as my feedback reflects the type of seller and buyer I am. I offer a no BS transaction. Plan on showing CO drivers license or CWP (preferred). NO Felons, bad guys, tire kickers, time waster's etc. I reserve the right to refuse sale. Have a great day and God Bless!"

Front site looks striaght, good clean rivets and snug mag well. Not one of the early WASRs. Cycles rounds, feeds and ejects flawlessly by hand. As a commemorative I have never fired it. Has a unit insignia on the reciever and the foreend grips are engraved . Comes with two steel mags.

Norinco is a RPK, good shooter. I've fired 200 rounds through it, love the size feel and comfort of the longer AK version. Comes with one 40 rd mag.

The VZ-58 comes with 4 mags, bayonet, sling. If you have never seen one, google this. The reciever is milled and the action looks similar to me with the SVD dragonov as if the Czechs patterened this rifle after it. More accurate than a AK and still in service with the Czech army. Plenty of video on youtube...

Including a 500rd pack of unopend brown bear go with all three at once with a drum mag or 200rds of tula each if sold individually. Selling all three at once for 3500, 2 for $2400 or 1400 each. I really don't want to break them up, but would for a local FTF sale.
