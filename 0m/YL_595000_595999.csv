I am putting this up for sale hoping to recoup some funds. These are rare. Very rare. These are not sold to the general public only the Navy, Coast Guard or agencies. 

Heres the story behind this one. A friend of mine bought a decommissioned Coast Guard cutter and upon signing the papers and the cutter and all things it contained becoming his we looked around the vessel and this happened to be in one of the side compartments. After finding it we were unsure of its legality so we contacted the ATF over in NOLA and they said it is 100% LEGAL only if it has the canister connected, which it does, a brand new one at that. If the canister is not on it it becomes a SBR which needs to be registered. This is still a firearm. So my buddy and I came to an agreement and I walked away with it, after a CG Captain had a fit haha. 

Now to the details. Manufactured in 1981. This thing is in perfect condition. The canister is brand new as well as a few of the brass rods and one spool of line. It has another box for line but it is empty. It fired 45-70 BLACK POWDER BLANKS, which there is almost a full box of with the sale. It comes with the cleaning handle and rod and two wooden dowels to rewind the line and 5 brass rods which shoot. The barrel is NOT rifled. The pictures will show everything it comes with. I am asking $1400, the only reason it is that cheap is because there is minor pitting in the barrel because the CG decided to store it with a brass rod in the barrel, stupid I know. I will deliver up to Hattiesburg or ship to your FFL for another $50, the box is heavy. This is ALL ORIGINAL, and the ONLY MANUFACTURER has given their blessing to help if it is ever needed. These are rare.

From my private collection is a brand new never-fired heavy fluted barreled FN Herstal FNAR. I bought this rifle as a compromise between a battle and a sniper rifle. For those of you that don't know, the FNAR shoots sub-MOA groups straight out of the box with absolutely no gunsmithing required. This gun will easily out-shoot its H&K counterparts and will even give a Springfield M1A a run for its money at significantly less cost. 

The rifle comes from the factory with 1 -20 round magazine, 3 replaceable combs (cheek rests) for faster acquisition of targets through optics and extra spacers for adjusting length of pull with very little effort. 

I've also added a Nikon 6-24x military dot scope, high durability rings and aftermarket bi-pod. Also included in the sale (for the right price) will be a airplane safe aluminum case as well as the original plastic FN case. I don't have a great desire to sell this gun, but i decided that my motorcycle itch is outweighing my firearm obsession and there's only so much riding season left, so my prized piece has to go before it was ever fired.

For the right deal i can also throw in 400 rounds of Portuguese surplus FMJ ammunition in two sealed battle packs.

I have very little interest in trades unless they're seriously in my favor and i can flip 'em for a good profit. Cash price is somewhat negotiable based on the accessories included, but low-ballers shouldn't waste either of our time. i have lots of pictures i can email if for some reason this one doesn't post well. 

Thanks in advance for your interest!

I am including the best quality ammo you can get: 10 rounds of Winchester PDX-1 2.5"" .410 Defense rounds (copper disc and BB, better than buck or slug from a short barrel).  Also comes with 8 rds of .45 LC Bonded JHP and 3 rds of 3"" rifled slug.  I will also include a pocket holster.

I have everything I need to hunt, but I live in an apartment and can't process game myself. I can always go to a butcher, but it feels like a waste to pay upwards of a hundred dollars just to have someone else grind up the meat when I know lots of hunters do it themselves.
If you, or anyone you know, can turn a dead animal into tasty food, please shoot me an email. I know lots of guys just like to keep their skills up, and would enjoy the practice, but I am more than willing to pay. Cash, a share of the meat, ammo, you name it. Hell, I'll even let you come along on the hunt if you'd like.

This is one of the rarest and most sought after Factory made Military Short Barreled AK47's in 7.63x39 out there (not the wimpy 5.56x45). Very hard to find and collectable! I have two of them...this is an extra I have been saving NIB, the other I am in the process to SBR it ($200 tax stamp on ATF Form 1). Awsome short stroke AK and the most well built....I also have a WASR 10/63 Romaininan AK47 underfolder and this M92 Krinkov blows it away hands down in quality!!!! 

An SBR version of this goes for $2000 - $2500 used.

These are usually bought to make back into an SBR as the long ""hollow tube Horn flash hider"" that is on it to make it legal lenght can be removed and the original Yugo short flash hider installed once you get your $200 tax stamp to SBR it. youtube ""M92 Krinkov"" and see for yourself what an awsome weapon this is!!

This is the big boy, bad boy, bad @ss AK 47 out there and the rarest!
This was built by the famous Gun Smith Red Jacket on the correct No-Dak Spuds Lower Undefolder Receiver. 

This is not a used de-milled parts kit! This is a NEW virgin from the Yugo Factory M92, made for the Yugo military's version of the Speznaz for CQB!

It's one of the ultimate dream guns. It has been featured toward the top of the food chain in the world of guns for 25 years. The design has been steadily refined until it's as proven a system as man can devise. It provides rapid, accurate firepower with untarnished reliability. In late 2004, the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division requested a medium/heavy rifle and cartridge combination. The .416 Barrett was designed as an improvement to the .50 BMG using NACA low supersonic drag equations to determine the shape of the projectile. The use of a lighter, narrower bullet results in a significantly higher muzzle velocity and superior ballistic performance to the .50 BMG, supposedly to such a degree that the .416 Barrett retains more energy than the .50 beyond 1000 yards. The projectile remains supersonic to out around 2000 yards."

This thing is clean! It is in like new condition, except better because it has recently been cerakoted, which if you do not know, is a very durable and extremely nice looking finish. The entire frame and slide is done in a matte charcoal gray while the serations, all controls, pins, safety levers, hammer, trigger and barrel are finished in a matte black. Please e-mail me if you want more pictures.

-Kimber make some of the best top of the line 1911's out there and this is a deal! Included is 4 mags (when you buy a Kimber, you get 1 (7) round mag). 3 of them are the very reliable 8 round Kimpro mags which are pretty expensive. The gun alone from Kimber is around $900. Besides 3 extra mags, I am throwing in an IWB (In the Waist Band) concealed carry leather holster for 1911's, which is soft and comfortable. Also included is all factory equipment like manual, factory sights and box. This thing is sporting a VERY nice set of XS BIG DOT quick acquisition/combat tritium night sights. I love them. They are very nice sights and very good for concealed carry as they are very visible in almost any light, including dark (for parking lots and such at night). The trigger on this gun is amazingly smooth and somewhat light (around 3lb trigger pull). The hammer and trigger are skeletonized and the 4"" barrel is very hefty and much larger than other basic 1911's like Colt's, Springfield's, Taurus's and so forth, to guarantee a long lasting life of accuracy. Lastly, for anyone interested in getting or that currently owns a Comptac brand Minotaur holster, I am throwing in a 1911 Kydex shell which costs $38 through Comptac. This allows the holster to fit specifically to a 4"" 1911.

My price is $950 and this gun is worth more with the sights, mags, and cerakote finish. My price is also only slightly negotiable. I am looking for a Springfield XDS .45 currently and may accept a trade but not willing to accept a trade on much else. Hell, make an offer. Worst that can happen is I say no. Please do not expect me to drive very far. You want the gun, you come to me like you would a gun store. I will only sell to Ohio residents with DL, unless you want gun shipped. For shipping, you must pay transfer fees and shipping costs. Please contact me for further information regarding purchasing this firearm or payment options."

This rifle started out as a standard stainless carbine model, bought brand new about 3 months ago. Since then it has been modified with the following:

Green Mountain 20"" Stainless Target Barrel
Boyd's SS Evolution Stock - Sky Blue
KIDD ""Trigger Job"" Kit - 1-3/4lbs
KIDD Auto Bolt Release
KIDD Extended Magazine Release - Interchangeable
KIDD Bolt Buffer
KIDD Cocking Assembly
KIDD Receive Pin Kit
UTG Low Profile Scope Mount
Simmons 22 Mag 3-9 X 32 Scope
& More...

Just in parts alone there is just over $450 invested into this gun, not including the original purchase price of $289 as it was the stainless model with the black composite stock.

The gun has about 500-700 rounds through it, and the barrel was broken well with intermittent cleaning every 50-100 rounds. Great gun, and shooting it is a blast.

I am asking $600 or best offer

Not in a hurry to sell, so just shoot me an offer or trade. Thanks!

If you know fine AR's then you know these rifles are at the top of the food chain when it comes to accuracy, dependability and just plain bad assness! I bought this rifle new in February, 2012 from a high end dealer in OKC. I've probably put close to 250 rounds thru the barrel and followed all the LWRC barrel break in procedures. This rifle eats 62 grain green tips an shoots tight groups with Black Hills 75 grain match bullets. This AR has it ALL. This rifle is OD green CeraKote , match Gisselle's match trigger, Magpul CTR stock, YHM flip up front and rear sights, BCG factory treated with a dura coating that almost makes cleaning the BCG a breeze.  

Only serious buyers I may have a small amount if wiggle room on the price but not much. If your looking for a bargain basement deal don't even contact me. I don't need the money and I will keep it before I'd give it away. Rifle comes with 1 Magpuul 30 Round P-mag. Only reason I am selling is I'm wanting to build a high end AR-10 to hunt feral hogs that have taken over my ranch. 

Again serious buyers only I don't want to trade unless its a high end AR-10. However cash works for me just fine. Take a look at the pic and I can email more upon on request. F.Y.I. The scope in the picture isn't included I just mounted this 3x9x40 bushnell on the rifle once to see how it would group with a scope at 150-200 yards and yes it was shooting quarter sized groups at both distances.  

Please note this add is for a LWRC M-6 AR Gas Piston rifle ONLY!! I'm not asking for anyone's help to kill feral hogs on my ranch. I don't need that kind if liability. If your looking for a place to hog hunt don't look here!!!

- Wood grips
- Original serial numbers on slide, frame, and barrel.
- Very good condition considering its age.

- This thing shoots phenomenally, I'd keep as my 9mm competition gun; however, competition doesn't seem likely for me this year. This is a great platform to build upon while still having a bit of history with modern day utility. 

I've been told that this is a collector's piece. Before FN/Browning had their parts made from cast. This is a rare piece from the 80's, good luck trying to find these locally on sale or on online auctions.

Lasergrips promote faster shooting, positive target acquisition and are tremendous training aids.

Custom touches include a recessed slide stop pin and elegant two-tone non-reflective finish. Crimson Carry frames are machined from solid bricks of premium aluminum-dramatically reducing weight for easier carry. Match grade triggers break crisp and clean. 

Little things make a big difference in performance. Kimber pistols are enhanced with custom features like an extended thumb safety lever with deep serrations for positive grip and Commander-style hammers that will not cut or snag. 

Having confidence in a carry pistol is critical. Dependability and accuracy proven through repeated practice increases confdence. Crimson Trace Lasergrips project a bright red dot downrange, an important aid in training. Reading the dot immediately shows the advantage of proper grip and trigger control, which can dramatically improve accuracy and reduce time between shots for any level of shooter. Crimson Carry pistols come with Crimson Trace Lasergrips; the finest laser sight available today. Combining that advantage with Kimber quality makes Crimson Carry pistols an unbeatable value. Offered in three sizes, they are ideal for law enforcement, home defense or concealed carry. 

FEATURES:
- The Custom Crimson Carry II has a 5-inch match grade barrel and match grade barrel bushing.
- The Pro Crimson Carry II and Ultra Crimson Carry II have bushingless match grade bull barrels fitted directly to the slide.
- Crimson Trace Lasergrips are activated by a pressure pad just below the trigger guard at the front of the grip.
- Lasergrips are a $359 value when purchased separately. They are powered by two #2032 lithium batteries with over 4 hours run time.

It has the factory TAC rail and fingered grip, excellent finish, ready to head to the range or hide in a drawer.

Additional features include a detachable box magazine and swivel studs. The Model 10 FCP HS Precision also utilizes Savage’s AccuTrigger system. This inclusion features a dual-stage trigger design in which the first (vented) trigger acts to disengage a safety mechanism. Once this occurs, the second trigger can be depressed in order to activate the firing pin - the trigger assembly is also user-adjustable for weight of pull. The Model 10 FCP HS Precision also features Savage’s patented AccuStock system. The AccuStock utilizes an integral aluminum spine that runs the length of the forearm, resulting in a more rigid stock that allows the barrel to float freely. In addition, the AccuStock is bedded so as to apply both horizontal and vertical (3-dimensional) pressure to the action. This achieves in a tighter fit between stock and action, resulting in increased overall gun accuracy. 

The Model 10 FCP HS Precision is drilled and tapped for scope mounts and is designed for law enforcement applications.

Enough said!!

The SPAS-12 was designed by the Italian company Luigi Franchi Spa as a special purpose, military and police close combat weapon (actually, SPAS stands for Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun, or Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun, depending on the source). It featured a selective action for greater versatility, and can be used as a gas operated semi-automatic repeater or as a manually operated pump action repeater, depending on the mission and ammunition used. Since its introduction SPAS-12 became a very popular police and special-forces weapon, being versatile, reliable and with good firepower. On the other hand, it is heavier than most other similar shotguns and quite complicated, which results in relatively high prices.

SPAS-12 utilizes somewhat traditional for shotguns gas system with annular gas piston locating around the under barrel magazine tube. It operates the bolt with vertically tilting locking lug that engages the barrel extension to lock.SPAS-12 can be switched between gas operated self-loading mode and manually operated pump mode by pressing and holding a button at the bottom of the forearm and pulling the forearm slightly forward for AUTOMATIC mode or backward for PUMP(or MANUAL) mode. Earlier models of the SPAS-12 had the lever type safety at the front of the trigger guard, but due to some deficiencies this was latter replaced by the push-button (cross-bolt) safety at the same place. 

SPAS-12 could be fitted with stamped metallic butt-stock that folds to the top of the receiver when not in use, and with a pistol grip made of plastic. Alternatively, solid plastic butts-tocks with pistol grips are available. Barrel has cylinder bore with screw-on muzzle devices (cokes of flash hiders). Sights usually are of rifle type, with post front and open notch rear sight.

This is a duplicate firearm in my collection and am selling due to having multiple Glock 21 models.   It has less than 500 total rounds through it and has been meticulously cared for.  There is no wear on the finish and has never been holstered.  It has a Lone Wolf Grip Plug with the Greek term ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ (""Come and get them"" ) which adds cool factor.  On October 1st, I replaced the orginal night sights with new Tru Glo Brite Sites and they are very nice!     Talon Adhesive Rubber grips are super for a sure grip without adding thickness.  

Okay this disclaimer is due to the weird crap that I have experience lately on Armlist.

No trades, not interested.  The cash from the sale will be rolled back into another firearm or parts for rifle builds.   Oh and if you want it and agree to meet, please do not attempt to negotiate a lower price at the meet.  I will drive away.   Thanks for understanding!

Synthetic stock and forearm, matte black finish. Includes swivel studs for your sling. Comes with one magazine, Weaver see-through scope mounts, and a 3-9x40mm scope. I'll throw in any left over .270 ammunition I can find.

The scope needs to be zeroed. It should get you on paper at 25 yds as is.

I have seen this rifle listed from $300 to $600, depending on condition. This rifle has been well maintained and I would say it is in excellent shape. I think this is a fair price, but I will entertain offers.

I might even consider a trade for a semi-auto pistol (40 S&W, maybe 9mm) or a hunting-legal revolver (357 or 44). I would make up any difference in price.

I respectfully ask that this transaction be documented to record the transfer of weapon(s). Photo ID required. Thanks!

 Description 
Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Model B in 41AE caliber. It's been stored and is in excellent condition. The gun pictured may have a different serial number, but is a NIB Uzi. The guns were manufactured and fully assembled in Israel. Action Arms imported them as complete guns. You'll get the highest quality UZI Carbine you can get.

Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design.

This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Pistol Model in 9mm. It's been stored and is in excellent condition. The gun pictured may have a different serial number, but is a NIB Uzi. 
The UZI pistol was developed by Israel Military Industries (now IWI Ltd) during early 1980s from the famous Micro-UZI submachine gun. Intended users for the UZI pistol were various security agencies and services which wanted a high-capacity semi-automatic pistol, and civilian shooters (mostly in USA) which also wanted such gun with ""cool Uzi style"". Despite somewhat rough appearance UZI pistols were reliable and quite accurate. It also must be noted that 'original' UZI pistols should not be confused with full-size weapons based on semi-automatic only full-size Uzi carbines but without the shoulder stock. 
UZI pistol is blowback-operated semi-automatic weapon which fires from closed bolt. It has a stamped steel receiver and the bolt is fully enclosed inside. Bolt is of 'telescoped' design, that is, it is hollow in the front and encloses the rear part of the barrel when in battery. Uzi pistol has a single action trigger and utilizes an internal sliding striker (firing pin). Manual safety of sliding type, and is located above the grip on the left side of the gun. Magazines are of double stack design, interchangeable with other guns of Uzi family (in 9mm caliber). Sights are of open type, with flip-up rear sight, adjustable for windage. The guns were manufactured and fully assembled in Israel. Action Arms imported them as complete guns. You'll get the highest quality UZI Pistol you can get.

Description 
Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Model B in 9mm. It's been stored and is in excellent condition. The gun pictured may have a different serial number, but is a NIB Uzi. The guns were manufactured and fully assembled in Israel. Action Arms imported them as complete guns. You'll get the highest quality UZI Carbine you can get.
