This book contains actual fish hooks, not photos of hooks, which have caused the pages and covers to wave and warp.  It is in good used condition showing signs of  honest work and wear.  Page #1 has 14 hooks with 1 hook missing.  Pages 2 thru 13 have all 370 hooks in place.  Page #14 has 76 hooks with 10 hooks missing, and 1 hook loose.

Has quail engraving on one side and ducks on the other. Also when the gun is shot the receiver doesn't ""engage"" the shell, but it still feeds the new shell in the chamber. Gander Mountain said it is common and a $40 fix but I won't spend any more money on it. Nice gun just don't need it.

I purchased it back in Sept. 2010 and just can't afford to feed it anymore, plus I'm getting married in a few months and could use the money. It has no more than 50 rds through it, shoots great, is essentially almost new. The stock is a pretty much new Choate custom tactical stock (hasn't been shot with the stock on it yet) with adjustable cheek piece and buttpad. The scope is a virtually new Millett TRS-1 (4-16x50) w/ illuminated reticle and the included scope covers. The base is a 20moa Weaver picatinny and the mounts are 6-hole picatinny weavers. The whole package also includes a virtually new Turner Police/Tactical sling and some talcon detachable swivels, a virtually new 6-9"" Harris SBRM bipod, the original box (if you want it), the original accustock, and the box for the Millett optic (if you want it). Unfortunately I can't locate the manual for it at the moment but if you so desire I will do my best to find it. I would prefer a FTF in Ohio but will ship (buyer pays). There is nothing wrong with the rifle, just needs to go to a good home to someone who can afford to shoot it.

Properly broken in barrel will reach out and touch at greater distances than I am capable of, it was built to be a 1000 yard machine but I have only a 200 yard range to try it at so I can say it’s getting clover leaf groups on a good day (when I don’t have the shakes )at that range. Just want to see what’s out there for trade of interest .This is not an off the shelf rifle so please offer accordingly…picked this up for hunting trip that’s never going to happen and it would cost $1000 plus to build this right now but I don’t really want to sell ,I’m looking for trades"

I'm selling my 93 S10. automatic. This is an excellant work truck. Good strong engine that does not burn any oil at all. It had a valve job done a couple of years ago. It drives smooth, straight and quiet. Wouldn't be afraid to drive anywhere. It does have some rust, however the floors are solid and so is the bed. Tires are very good + I have an extra set of wheels and tires to go with. Plastic bedliner. I use the topper in the winter, and it comes off in the summer. Fun truck to drive. Hate to sell but I have to many vehicles. Well maintained, regular oil changes. Cruise works, and so does the air, radio, all gauges. Only thing bad is the rust, and a crack in the windshield. This crack runs straight down the passengers far side. It was like this when I bought the vehicle and its not distracting at all. Also has not or will not get any worse. It would make a great project truck if you like to do some minor body work. That's about it. I'm sure the new owner will be 100% pleased with this truck. Odometer reads right around 130k.. I can't think of anything more to say. If you have any questions, please send me an email. Thanks"

Langenhan F.L Selbstlader .32acp pistol. This is a German contract pistol made by Langenhan for the German military starting in 1915. This particular pistol has the plastic repro grips it did come with earlier wood grips and has a visible trigger bar. The bore is in great shape, bright and shiny with no pitting and strong rifling. The finish is a dull faded blue. This is a very interesting and collectable piece with lots of crown N proof marks.

The Intratec TEC DC-9 ""assault pistol"", also known as DC-9, TEC-9, or, if manufactured after 1994, as AB-10, bears the dubious distinction of being one of the most widely used ""criminal"" guns in USA. It was used in several mass murder cases, as well as in unknown, but definitely large number of street fights and other violent crimes. TEC-9 became ""famous"" for its ""evil"" appearance, large magazine capacity (which offered significant firepower), and for low price. Unsurprisingly, these features made TEC-9 very popular among various marginal types. For any serious or professional shooter this gun vas of little value - it was too big and heavy to be carried comfortably, it was too unreliable when firing anything but FMJ ammunition, and the accuracy with very crude fixed sights was about marginal.
The TEC-9 design was started in Sweden, when the Interdynamic AB company of Stockholm developed a relatively simple submachine gun. Since Sweden was a poor market for such product, a subsidiary company Interdynamic was established in Miami (Florida, USA), to market Interdynamic guns in USA. As the full-automatic weapons market in USA is very restrictive, the basic submachine gun was converted in semi-automatic only variant, apparently suitable for civilian US market. This semi-automatic pistol, like its submachine gun predecessor, was a simple blowback design, firing from the open bolt. It was designated Interdynamic KG-9. But, sooner than later, US Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) found that this semiautomatic pistol can be easily converted back to full automatic, and restricted it manufacture. Interdynamic redesigned the KG-9 into ""closed bolt"" design by adding the separate striker, and designated it KG-99. About the same time (mid-1980s) the Interdynamic of USA turned into Intratec Firearms, Inc, based in the same city of Miami (Florida). Intratec initially  produced the KG-99 under the designation of  TEC-9, but about 1989 renamed it into DC-9. With the introduction of the infamous US Assault Weapons Ban in 1994 the Intratec pistols were prohibited for manufacture (but not for ownership, if made before the ban). Intratec subsequently slightly redesigned the basic design, dropping some ""assault"" features like the threaded barrel, barrel shroud, and forward pistol grip. In this ""post-ban"" version the pistol was manufactured and sold as AB-10 (AB stands for After Ban). The AB-10 pistols were sold with 10-round magazines, but still could accept both factory and aftermarket high capacity magazines from its predecessors, TEC-9 and DC-9. There were several manufacturers in US, who made copies of DC-9, such as AA Arms, which produced DC-9 look-alike AP-9 pistols. Like originals, AP-9 pistols were of cheap construction and marginal reliability.
The Interdynamics and Intratec pistols are blowback operated, semi-automatic weapons. The major difference between Interdynamic KG-9 and Intratec TEC-9/AB-10 line of pistols is that KG-9 fired from the open bolt, and had a fixed firing pin; the Intratec pistols fire from closed bolt, and have a separate firing pin and a massive striker, which interoperates with the sear. The receivers of all versions are made from steel tube (either carbon or stainless), the frames (or ""lower receivers"") are made from polymer, integral with pistol grip and magazine housing ahead of the trigger guard. The tubular receiver is hinged to the front of the frame. There is no manual safety. The open-bolt Interdynamic KG-9 pistols featured a special cut, in which the charging handle can be locked when bolt in retracted. The KG-99 and Interdynamic pistols have manual safety built into charging handle - to lock the bolt, one must push the charging handle inward. All pistols are fed from double stack, detachable box magazines; standard magazine capacity was 20 or 32 rounds for pre-ban guns, and 10 rounds for post-ban guns. After-market magazines were offered in various capacities up to 50 rounds. Permanently fixed open sights were not adjustable, and often misaligned. In the pre-ban TEC-9 and DC-9 versions these pistol accepted screw-on barrel extensions, which had purely cosmetic purposes, or silencers (which were illegal in many jurisdictions)."

I am currently waiting on a new triangle handguard cap and a new set of usgi handguards before I sell or trade this upper, but thought I would go ahead and see what interest there was. The new handguards will be on it next week. I will make a new ad with pictures when I get the new handguards on it.

I have a 20"" Bushmaster A2 HBAR (heavy barrel) chrome lined upper with a 1/9 twist. This upper came off of a Bushmaster XM15 E2S. The barrel reads ""B MP 5.56 NATO 1/9 H BAR."" This is an A2 upper so it has the fixed carry handle. The chamber and bore are shiny and the rifling looks nice and sharp. It is a chrome lined barrel. I am selling this as a COMPLETE upper so it WILL come with the bolt carrier group and the charging handle. I also just upgraded the bolt with a Bravo Company SOPMOD bolt upgrade kit. It has the tougher Bravo company extractor with the Bravo Company extractor spring and crane o-ring.


I am looking to sell this upper so I can get a 20"" govt profile barreled upper. I will also consider trades for 16"" uppers or 20"" govt profile uppers or 20"" light weight barreled uppers. This rifle is going to be carried a lot so I need a lighter barrel.

The upper is on the middle rifle in the pic."

Mint condition. I have this posted in the rifle section because that is what I would like to trade for. I know what it is worth, but thanks for all of your opinions! If it's not for you then just move on.

With the build-up of hostilities during the mid 1960’s Randall Knives introduced a blade option for its new fighter models in order to relieve the back-up of standing orders which was reported to be up to one and one-half years. The blades manufactured in Solingen Germany were designed after the various types that would be utilized on the models # 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. The difference was that these imported blades were to be machine forged and preground, thereby greatly accelerating the manufacturing process. It is also interesting to note that there was a prerequisite for this dramatic departure from “Shop” policy, both in the creation of the “Springfield Fighter” during WW II and in Bo Randall’s plan to mass produce his proto-type knives for USMC use, should they have been accepted during the tests in 1954-55.

The introduction of the “Solingen” blade in both tool and stainless steel on the above mentioned models, would greatly expedite production during the Vietnam War years, by substituting a machine made blade, albeit a quality one, for the hand forged blade crafted in the Shop in Orlando. It should be remembered that like its predecessor in Springfield MA., the Solingen blade was created from the design of the original prototype furnished from the existing models and would be made to the same dimensions as the original. The prototype blades it can be assumed resembled the model(s) 14 & 15 then being made at the Randall Shop, which probably hadn’t been altered from the design developed for the USMC tests.

After what must have been a “trial and acceptance” period, the Solingen blade was made available with the apparent understanding that these machine forged and preground blades would only require polishing and touch-up work prior to sale. This did not prove to be the case. Herein lies the interesting distinction(s) that has created favoritism for one blade type or the other.

With the ability to produce numbers that far exceeded Orlando Shop levels, the Solingen blade, although often requiring what must have amounted to “major surgery” before shipping, nonetheless got into the hands of the military in vastly larger numbers and in an abbreviated time frame. Additionally, stainless steel was an option and for the first time was readily available and very suitable to the climate in Southeast Asia. Prior to this it would be safe to say the Bo Randall did not exactly favor stainless steel over his own carbon steel blades.

These circumstances together resulted in a great deal of recognition for Solingen blades, which were easy to get and cost less. Many collectors as well as servicemen who carried and used these models during the conflict relate to this and preferences were developing. As the war progressed and sales increased for these models, the “Shop” found subtle ways to improve the Orlando design(s). These little changes which impacted on blade and handle shapes, took place during the normal course of refinement just as the “All-purpose fighter” had seen gradual improvements during the previous decades.

One of the characteristics of these new Airman-Attack-Survival knives was the “prominent hump” on the blade back. The Orlando blade was to gradually taper into a more or less straight topline; not so with the Solingen. Why we ask? Probably because once the prototype had been satisfactorily made in Germany, and machinery was set to mass-produce these blades, change would be expensive and was undoubtedly considered unnecessary, if considered at all. For the collector (and user) we can introduce another reason for preference; a growing distinction in blade style."

I removed the tags, spent some time figuring out all the options for the pack, and then my Kifaru order came in. I will no longer be needing this pack. 

Honestly this Skycrane is designed for hunters/snipers. I really just wouldn't be using it for what it was designed for and that is why I needed to go a different route. I never used the skycrane, never tried to fit it, and any adjustments I made to the pack were minor strap tightenings while figuring it out.

Honestly I can't really describe it any better than they do, and their pictures sure are better than mine. I tried to show a few different options for the pack, but it really is hard to do.

This is the whole system, drag bag/scabbard, duffel, molle panel and two side ""pouches"". I am looking for $200 CASH, paypal or USPS Money Order or if you want it shipped, $20 shipping CONUS.

There is a sale pending at this time, but I will still take messages on it. If the sale falls through, I will take interest first come first serve.

It is used, I have had it for about 10 years now. It is in pretty nice shape. There are some small scratches but over all I have taken good care of it. It is not banged up or or rusty or anything like that. It looks good. I have not kept exact track but would guess I have put around 1,000 rounds or less through it in the time I have had it. All serial numbers match on all parts, this is not a ""frankenstien"" gun that is pieced together. There is also no wable in the magazine well, either side-to-side or back and forth. This is a good quality reliable firearm.

Everything is stock on this rifle, I have made no changes. If I where to keep it I would probably switch the trigger out with the Tapco version as I do not really like the triggers that are installed on these from the factory.

If you buy it I will need to check your MN I.D.
I will also need to see and make a copy of your MN permit to purchase OR your MN permit to carry a gun. I do not need a copy of your MN I.D., just the permit. This is to protect my ass. 
If you do not have a permit to purchase than it is EASY and FREE to get one, just go to your local police/sheriff's office and ask for one.
I will make a recipt that we can both sign and both keep a copy of.

P.S.
A sale is pending at this time, you may still massege me though. If the sale falls through then it is still first come first serve."

The ring pictured below is a custom four diamond man's pinky ring set in 14kt Gold. It has a 'brushed gold' face that tapers and narrows to one side with four different size diamonds in descending order. The four diamonds are lined up and set large to small with the main stone (“I” color VS-2) at just under a quarter carat set by itself and the other three diamonds are matched for clarity and lined up together along side to complement the main stone. The total diamond carat weight is just about a half carat. For information purposes this ring was made locally in 1982 and the original appraisal at that time based on the then gold price of $350/Troy oz was just under $1,000. The ring is in excellent condition. A copy of the original appraisal is available upon request. If interested in this ring contact me with what you have in a firearm that may interest me. My preference is for what is stated above but will consider other firearms in trade for the ring plus or minus cash depending on your trade item.
