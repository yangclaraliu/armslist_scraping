The Upper receiver is only a few months old and the barrel has seen about 300 shots. The barrel is CMV and has a 1:9 twist rate, chrome lined chamber and has a carbine length gas tube. The barrel and rifling has also been nitro-carburized to protect it. The upper receiver is from Vltor, which is nothing but quality and has a built in forward assist. Forearm is from Midwest industries and is the 15"" SS-series. I want $800 for the complete upper receiver w/magpul flip-up sights. Like I said, the upper is pretty much brand new. 

Could also sell as a package for someone who want's to build a complete rifle. I can make a package deal with all the parts listed below for around $900-$1000. All you would need is a stripped lower and you would have a better than average AR-15.

It has been adult operated and only ridden a couple times a year. This isn't your normal sport four wheeler. It has independent rear suspension and is fuel injected. If I had to take a guess, I would say the four wheeler has less than 50 hours on it total. Less than a year ago, I bought all 4 brand new tires for it, not because the others were worn but because I trail ride and the stock tires just weren't cutting it. The tires alone cost me $550 and have only been on 2 rides. Everything else on it is completely stock. I changed the oil after every ride (like a said, it was only rode about 2 times a year). There are absolutely zero malfunctions, dings, or major scratches. Just normal wear on the plastic, which is minimal. The only reason I'm selling it is because I recently purchased a RZR and this has to go. Asking $3500 but will entertain all reasonable offers. I would be interested in trading to some rifles or handguns.  I have more pictures upon request. Call/text me at 502-386-9one0one. -Mike"

(Must register in advance, payment accepted the day of the class)

Continental Breakfast Provided

Instructor Qualifications:

CCH Instructor since 2007
Full Time Police Officer
Police Firearms Instructor (Certified by the Kansas Law Enforcement Training Center, 92 hour course)
NRA Pistol Instructor
30 years Firearms Experience



I have real-world experience and teach from that perspective. I add to the basic curriculum to help better prepare students for the challenges of concealed carry and the
potential use of deadly force.

We cover CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Armed Response / Self Defense, Interaction with Law Enforcement and much more.

This is an excellent class taught by a knowledgeable instructor with a bit more than the AG CCH Instructor certification.

Many instructors base there classes on things learned in books and pseudo tactical as seen on TV
My instruction is based on proven and experienced technique and instruction

I have the opportunity to interact with many Concealed Carry Permit holders and have found that many times the information they received was inaccurate and sometimes dangerous.

I believe in Concealed Carry and the right to self defense and that is why I teach. If you are wanting to carry a firearm, just be sure you ask questions of your instructor; their philosophy and true credentials. It is easy to become concealed carry instructor, but it takes experience in armed conflict and full knowledge of the law to offer what is really required.

It is possible that your life, or in the case of a wrong decision your liberty, will depend on the quality and accuracy of the instruction you receive. No matter what class you take, check the credentials of the instructor. Please! For Your Sake.

IWB Holster (Comp Tac Ghurka for a Beretta 92FS)

This is an awesome holster designed for carrying a full size weapon concealed. This most closely resembles the COMPTAC ""CTAC"" holster (which sells for $80 + tax + shipping), but they no longer make this one. It's a little bulky because it's for a full size hand gun, but considering the size and weight of a fully loaded Beretta 92fs, this does an excellent job at supporting it comfortably.

Remington 700 bull barrel  sps tactical 
the action has been tuned and refined by  accuracy international trigger pull around 10 oz it breaks like glass. The rifle was sent to Accuracy International to be fitted ""true "" to stock . Which does cost extra by the way .
Comes with a long range Nikon Monarch BDC reticule cost around 500 with the tactical  rings , by the way most the other rifles of this caliber don't come with a good scope...
The stock has the ability to add a AI swivel bipod but I prefer a traditional Harris which is mounted currently.
Also a pelican air sealed case with foam and room for other goodies...
Includes 3 ten round mags and one 5 round mag that run 80 buck for the 10 rounders and 50 for the ten rounders 
Not to mention the AI stock ran  over grand having it set up by them .

This would cost you over 3,000 to build this!!! One question to ask other rifles did they set it up or have a professional ????

You get the pelican case 4 mags a long range great piece of glass and a quality stock that is mounted professionally and has around 200 rounds down none under a 100 yards by the way , this beauty has been well taken care of and has a great future. 

pistol and knife not included sorry  PRICE IS FIRM AND THE BEST DEAL I HAVE SEEN ONLINE .FOR THE MONEY FOR WHAT YOU GET.

I purchased the rifle a few years ago the previous owner had it in pieces (but he really didn't know what he had at the time). I had the original buttstock piece but the foregrip was missing. It was a bit heartbreaking to find such a great gun missing the foregrip but I had plans to eventually sporterize it anyway which is why I tossed the gun's chassis into the synthetic monte carlo stock.

The 7-30 Waters cartridge is a wildcat cartridge developed by author Ken Waters in 1976 to give better performance to lever action rifle shooters than the parent .30-30 Winchester cartridge, by providing a higher velocity and flatter trajectory with a smaller, lighter bullet. By 1984, Winchester introduced a Model 94 rifle chambered for the 7-30 Waters, establishing it as a commercial cartridge. In 1986, Thompson/Center began chambering 10"", 14"" and 20"" Contender barrels for the cartridge"

This is a brand new .223 Saiga rifle, which was professionally converted by Sierra Arms International from the original “sporting/hunting” configuration to a very affective Assault Rifle platform. This conversion is second to none! 

Professional modifications are as follows: 

AK74 Threaded Front sight installed, which accepts all 24mm compensators, flash hiders, etc.; Barrel machined to receive traditional lower hand guard and retainer; Bolt and carrier modified and polished at contact points for smooth action; Fire control group replaced with US-Made G2 unit and moved forward; G2 fire control group machined and polished for supreme fit and function; Trigger guard and mag catch replaced with monolithic AKM unit; Pistol grip nut clearance machined into receiver and grip moved forward; Very thick, nearly corrosion proof, mil-spec parkerizing in very dark satin gray. 

Premium features are as follows:

16” chrome lined barrel; Black US-Made K-Var stock, pistol grip, and foregrips; Bulgarian vented gas tube; Indexed modern Russian-type birdcage muzzle brake for increased control; Adjustable AK74 front sight with muzzle brake detent and 24mm threads; Fitted and mounted cleaning rod; Shepherd’s hook fire control group retainer; Bolt hold-open latch.

Also includes the following:

Original Russian owner’s manual; Original oil can; Original tool/cleaning  kit, which will fit into K-Var stock; 1 SGM 30 round magazine and 1 ProMag 30 round magazine.

If you're in the market for an AK47, get yours from the country that created it: the authentic Russian Kalashnikov AK47 in NATO 5.56x45mm. This rifle is far superior to cheaper versions that originated from other countries and were most likely rebuilt from a kit. This is a solid and affective rifle, and it will last for decades.

The listed price reflects a cash discount of 3%. Qualifications for cash discounts include cash, cashier's check, money order, or other checks. Credit card payments do not qualify for cash discounts and are therefore 3% more than the listed price (plus shipping if applicable).

As you can see, it's pretty awesome.
(Originally, it was FACTORY FDE, and now has a custom Duracoat Paintjob)

I have invested nearly $4500 into this rifle, and can provide receipts.

I am looking to trade, but I will entertain trades and cash.
I know what the value/trade value of my rifle is, please do not try to lowball me.
I will only deal FTF, I live in northern VA, and am willing to travel up to 4 hours.

Geissele Super SCAR Trigger: VERY rare See Below

The Geissele Trigger:
This upgrade is expensive, and INSANELY difficult to acquire.
It adds Significant value to the rifle, improves the weapons feel & function, and Tremendously improves this weapons already great accuracy.
Stock, the SCAR has a MUSHY, Single-Stage 7-8 LB trigger (Meh!)
The Geissele transforms this into:
A Precise, 4LB, Dual-Stage, Match Grade Trigger, with zero creep, a crisp break, and a azor sharp reset (Wow!)
It now feels virtually identical to an Accuracy International AW, or other HIgh-End 2 stage sniper trigger.
This weapon can be employed as a rugged battle rifle, and now pull double duty as a dedicated precision sniper platform.

Duracoat Process:
The Entire rifle, all magazines, and all hardware were stripped down to individual parts. All parts were then hand prepped, and Duracoated in ""Woodland Tan SL"" (Gas Block Assembly, Flash Suppressor, and barrel were finished in Duraheat, same color.)
Parts were then cured for 1 week, then reassembled.
The stripe was then added, to the fully assembled rifle, in ""Magpul Flat Dark Earth SL"" (Gas Block Assembly, Barrel, and Flash Suppressor were striped in ""Flat Dark Earth"" Duraheat.)
2 layers of ""Matte Clear SL"" were added to entire assembled rifle (Gas Block Assembly, Barrel, and Flash Suppressor finished in ""Matte Clear"" Duraheat)
The rifle was then left alone for 6 weeks to allow full curing of Duracoat & Duraheat.
This process was professionally performed by a military armorer with more than 2 years of professional Duracoating experience.

These PICS just do not convey the detail, or sheer awesomeness of this paint job.
Additional pics available upon request


I Purchased this rifle new in May
I am ex military,and a former LE sniper.
I have lovingly, and expertly, broken-in, modified, and maintained this weapon.
It is rugged, and tuned for battle, but it is a safe queen, and is MINT.
Round count: EXACTLY 183 rounds fired

Suppressor is NOT included

This SCAR setup is an AMAZING weapon system, and a fantastic opportunity.
PLEASE: Serious offers only, No silly or low-ball offers.
I am not willing to part out this weapon.
I will NOT sell just the trigger."

Everything is in excellent + condition. It’s highly impressive to look at and shoot. I just decided I have little use for this rifle as I rarely shoot over a 100 yards and when I do shoot it’s just paper. .308 is a little overkill for that. I would be willing to entertain trades on similar AR15s in 5.56/.223 only. What I prefer is something like 16” barrel with 12” rail like what is on this. Depending on your AR (make, optics, spec sheet, etc., expect to pay some cash difference. I will be fair on the trade, but know what we both have.

I will also consider trades on an FN FS2000, FN SCAR, or Steyr Aug. But please keep in mind that I am not willing to add any money to this for a trade. I can’t spend another dime on guns until the year is over. 

If you are wanting to trade a standard configured AR toward it, expect to put a considerable amount of cash with it. I’m not trying to sound like an a$$, just trying to avoid getting a lot of bottom end AR15s even trade offers. I can easily buy 3 standard AR15s for what it cost’s to build one of these.

Not interested in bolt guns, shotguns, and very few handguns. An HK P30 or P30L in 9mm only is about the only handgun that comes to mind. You can ask, but please don’t be upset if I decline.

Please have pictures available for any trades.

If you have any questions, or want specific pictures, feel free to ask. I can meet about anywhere in East Tennessee."

Unique to this model is a chrome lined 11.5"" barrel with 5.5"" Flash Suppressor permanently attached (pinned and welded over) for a total length of 16"" from the factory. I have 3, window P-Mag and 2, steel. this rifle was built to be light. I am running a Magpul MOE handguard with the large rail attachment, and a polymer front forward grip. the hand grip is a hogue rubber. I added a single point sling attachment and bungee sling is included. also I am running the Magpul flip up rear. I also istalled a large latch charging handle, for single handed operation. I will also include what Ammo I have, prob around 100rds with some fun tracer rounds. also included is the bushnell holo sight, which is actually built by EOTECH, but half the price, and half the weight (does not have the heavy protective shroud like the EOTECH's do) I also have the original Bushmaster hard case. and a Tactical style soft case. Original handguards. I also have a very nice carry handle/ rear sight. I forget the maker but its super solid and super accurate. it had windage and elevation adjustment. and a low ligh peep apateur as well as the standard peep. (flip between the 2). the one negetive about this gun is some slight wear on the castle nut and sling attachment from running this gun one handed. not very noticable and could easily be taken care of wih some gun blue. this gun is not a safe queen, she eats any type of ammo you throw at her and begs for more. I probably have around 1,000 rounds or less through her. I did have an issue with the gas key coming loose due to a bad stake job from the factory, and Bushmaster actually corrected this problem by me sending the bolt back after the first 100 rounds. now she is staked properly and have literally not had a misfead since. I hate to sell, but am doing some thining of the heard, this was a drem gun for me. you will not b dissapointed. please no trade offers, or low ball offers. the gun is worth more than I am asking. but I think its a more than a fair price. this gun is in super condition. has not been in the dirt once, and I am super O.C.D. about keeping my girls stored properly and clean. call me with any questions REDACTED"

I'm interested in just about any type of handgun provided that it's not a piece of junk. I'm partial to quality pieces, 1911s and Smith & Wesson Revolvers. I'm also interested in Semi Auto Rifles but I wouldn't turn down a decent Shotgun if it's a good deal. Open to anything really and have a CCDW exemption for Private Sale.

For Long Guns I would lean towards interest in something chambered in 5.45x39, one of the AK74 variants preferably, a VEPR would be ideal, with full wood but I'd certainly consider all others too. If you have something that you want to part with drop me a note.

The car could use new strutts in rear but we drive it like it is. Not sure gas mileage but we can put little gas in it and it drives long way. That is why it is being used to go back and forth to work in now. Inside is not to bad as just needs to be cleaned up as we do haul two grandkids around in it. It does not smoke at all but It Does leak a little motor oil as needs few gaskets. I simply am getting rid of car at great price as I already have 3 trucks and this would save me on insurance. I will not go any lower on price and it is cash only sale. Questions?
