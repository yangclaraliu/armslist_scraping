Trigger was redone last year by my gunsmith and while he was at it I had him go over the entire gun. Less than a hundred rounds through the gun since. Very reliable accurate weapon, with a nice weight & recoil. The only difference I can tell between this and a ""loaded"" is no serration on the front of the slide and no etching on the grip.

The gun shot incredibly well, I just don't get it out much anymore because I enjoy handgun shooting more now.

Let me give you a quick rundown of the gun. I purchased the gun for about $700 as a new Remington 700 BDL Varmint model with a 26"" bull barrel in 308 Winchester. It holds 4 rounds in its internal box magazine. I have done a lot of things to improve it though, here's a quick list:

Fire Lapped the barrel using David Tubb's fire lapping bullets. Did this early on in the guns life using a very careful procedure as outlined with the bullets. It really did help and made cleaning it so much easier.

Trigger job- It has the X-mark pro trigger on it, I adjusted it down to somewhere in the neighboorhood of 2 lbs (I don't have a scale to measure it, but it breaks like glass). 

Replaced the plastic stock- The gun came with an injection molded plastic stock. I got rid of that cheap plastic thing as quick as possibe. I opted for the Hogue overmolded stock with a full aluminum bedding block that I bedded the action into using a Devcon steel putty that is resistant to chemicals. The barrel is completely free floated in it. The stock was about $190, plus the time and parts that are involved in bedding the action and floating the barrel (typical gunsmith charges $100-$200 plus parts). Also on the stock I installed a monte carlo cheek riser to better align my eye with the scope. It is the same rubber material as the Hogue stock, so it fits in nicely.

Replaced the firing pin- I installed a firing pin assembly with a slightly higher power spring. The firing pin assembly ran about $70.

Installed a Leupold Mark 4 scope rail with a 15 moa slope on it. The scope rail runs about $125. It will be included with the gun and will take any picatinny type scope rings. No scope is included with the gun.

That pretty well sums up my list of mods. Here's the bottom line, this gun (at least last time I shot it which was several years ago) shot like an absolute dream. I've got one of the last targets I shot with it in hand and will try to post a picture of it on here. I built it as a precision rifle because at the time I was trying to get into F-Class shooting. I want to be completely open and honest though so here is something not so great about it. The stock has a few scuff marks on it. 

The gun shot very well back when I was shooting it and I have no doubt it will again, I just don't have a use for it any longer. I'm asking $1000 for this gun with all of it's improvements. I do require a bill of sale on any gun that I sell even though it is not required by law, it is so I can keep track of what I have sold.  If you are unwilling to fill one out then please do not reply."

The LED has no filament to burn out or break and generates tactical-level light—enough to overwhelm an aggressor's night-adapted vision—for 2.4 hours per set of batteries. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it submersible to 22 meters. The X300 Rail-Lock system comes with adapter plates permitting rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. An ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation. Optional pistol grip switches permit operation with the top grip finger, leaving the index finger free to operate the handgun trigger. Other switches are available for operating the X300 when attached to a long gun.

It has a Winchester receiver, barrel and stock with 2 hole upper hand guard and type 2 rear sight. The stock variation is oval sling cut with low wood that exposes slide. It has the W.R.A/G.H.D. with the crossed cannons stamp inspection marks from Winchester Repeating Arms and the G.H.D. were the initials of the inspector in charge of that district. It was marked by a ""U"" for Underwood which means it had some parts replaced for better functionality. My M1 had the barrel band, slide, magazine catch, safety and sight all changed to improve function as mentioned above. 

I copy and pasted my source for this as well as the paragraph that discusses it. 


http://www.bavarianm1carbines.com/partsbparts.html

""The U.S. Caliber .30 Carbines consisted of 56-81 parts, depending on the model and time of manufacture.
U.S. Ordnance redesigned a number of parts over the course of production and after WWII, several parts more than once. Most of these changes were to improve reliability and/or function, manufacture time, and/or cost. None of the changes were so critical as to merit a massive recall. A few of these changes were important enough to merit replacing the earlier part with the later variant when the carbine could be inspected by U.S. Ordnance personnel. For most carbines this wouldn't happen until after the end of the war.
Two of the unique things about the U.S. GI M1 Carbines are almost all of the parts are backwards and forwards compatible regardless of whatever change was made, and, all of the parts are interchangeable from one carbine to another without requiring individual fitting."""

-Mil-Spec receiver -Barrel Length: 16.25"" -1:10 RH twist -Black polymer stock and Picatinny rail forearm -Tactical pistol grip -Tactical sling swivel -Adjustable front and rear sight -Overall Length: 36"" -Weight: 7lbs 

This is quite a complete package that includes the rifle, 3 complete stock sets (original I.O. stock with picatinny lower handgaurd and SAW style buttstock, a Galil style stock set with folding buttstock, and a rare Hungarian style red stained wood stock with bakelite pistol grip), 139 rounds of Wolf ammunition, 20 stripper clips, a magazine loader, 3 steel 30 rd magazines, 2 polymer 10 rd magazines, magazine doubler, vertical foregrip (can attach to rail on original lower handgaurd), front sight adjustment tool, spare gas tube, nylon sling, Gunslick cleaning kit, and a .30 cal Tipton Deluxe 1-piece cleaning rod.

I purchased this rifle mid 2011 (after I.O. solved their early QC issues) and have fired about 300 rounds through it since then. It has functioned flawlessly (zero failures) and I would love to keep it; however, I will be moving to a state that does not permit AKs in a few weeks, so I need to find a good home for it.

Although AKs require essentially no maintenance or cleaning, I was extremely diligent about cleaning it thoroughly after every range session. The bore is shiny and pristine and the barrel crown is immaculate. All of the internals have been well cared for.

Listed below are the prices I paid for each of the items included in this package:

I.O. Inc. Sporter Rifle: $599.99
Tapco Galil Style Handguard: $23.99
3x 30 rd Steel Magazines: $75 ($25 each)
2x 10 rd: $20 ($10 each)
Wooden Stock set w/ Bakelite Grip: $85
Sight Adjustment Tool: $15
Vertical Foregrip: $15
Stripper Clips: $8
139x 7.62x39 ammunition: $40 ($5.75 per box of 20x minus the one missing)
Magazine Loader: $5
Magazine Doubler: $5
Tipton Deluxe 1-Piece Cleaning Rod: $28.99
Tapco Folding Stock: $25
Gunslick Cleaning Kit: $20

TOTAL: $970.97 (before taxes and shipping)

This is an extremely good deal at $800 for you in my opinion. I think I would be well within reason to mark this at >$900 dollars given the effort, time, and shipping charges it took to consolidate all of these great items and the near flawless condition of the rifle and accessories. Please only respond if you are a serious buyer. I am not interested in trades; cash only. I am willing to negotiate on the price."

The Crimson Trace Lightguard for GLOCK features a highly compact and slim design specifically for ease of holstering. Its 100 lumen tactical white light seamlessly attaches to your defensive pistol, much like Crimson Trace’s Laserguard.

Lightguard removes the need for a flashlight separate from the pistol. Both of these low-light tools can be operated separately or simultaneously with a single hand.

My wifes Taurus Taurus is up for sale.  It comes with 3 magazines and everything else.  This was her first gun and against my wishes wanted the ""pink"" gun.  The grip makes the little 32 snappy for her and she now wants a full size.  She learned her lesson and wants to rent a few at the BH before her next purchase.  So trades are very unlikely.  This gun has exactly 100 rounds through it and would make an excellent ccw for someone more experienced and who likes pink.

New conditon, just don't use it. Bought it brand new from manufacturer. Awsome comfortable IWB holster right hand.
The Nate Squared Tactical Professional holster is the ultimate IWB (inside-the-waistband) holster. It has all the comfort of our Original design, but comes with the following additional features: 

•ADJUSTABLE CANT
•TUCKABLE 
•EXCELLENT POSITIVE RETENTION
The holster is made of polycarbonate, which is an extremely durable thermoplastic. Common uses range from cd's & dvd's to bullet resistant glass. We chose to use polycarbonate because it has 30% more tensile strength and almost double the impact strength of acrylic-polyvinyl chloride, which is the material used by many of the most popular IWB holsters on the market today. All of this simply means that the Professional holster is made of the highest quality materials available. Using polycarbonate also allowed us to develop a positive retention IWB holster with our Twist Release SystemTM.
When the holster is worn, your body puts pressure against the backing, which presses the firearm against the polycarbonate. As shown in the cutaway (image 1) the polycarbonate actually holds the firearm in place and provides additional security for the retention of your firearm. Simply drive your thumb between the holster and the grip, then slightly twist the grip toward your body to release the trigger guard from the retention bump (image 2) for a smooth draw! 
As with most holsters, when your holster is new the retention level may seem exaggerated, but as the leather, neoprene, and suede form to your firearm and to your body over the first few days, you will notice the draw becoming much smoother. $50 shipped"

The SP01 also has a cgw carbide firing pin retainer pin and carbide trigger pin installed as well so you can dry fire all you want without worrying about the pins breaking.

I don't have a title but will come with a bill of sale. I originally bought the bike to build and race, but never had the time to race it, so it sat in my garage collecting dust for the last 2 months. I prefer to sell it to someone that is going to use it. 

I'm sure there are a ton of items and details I forgot to include in the list. 

It has a ton of power and will outrun alot of the bigger kids bikes out there (XR100, TTR-110 etc)

It was professionally built so every detail was addressed and put together RIGHT. 

The bike/chassis only has about 50 hours on it when I bought it and then was taken apart and the race motor and suspension was installed.

Ok, obviously you all like this thing.  So let's get some of the bulk questions answered.  This is a new gun, unfired minus factory test.  I'm the second owner, bought to aid a newly jobless buddy to help him out.  Now as far as price...cash does talk, I'm a big fan of $100 bills.  I'm asking 1000 cash or trade or best offer.  As far as trades, if it don't peak my interest, I'm probably not going to give you what it may be worth.  If it peaks my interest, the sky is the limit.  I am not stuck on the trade list attached here, but those are things I want off the top of my head.

I don't have a title but will come with a bill of sale. I originally bought the bike to build and race, but never had the time to race it, so it sat in my garage collecting dust for the last 2 months. I prefer to sell it to someone that is going to use it. 

I'm sure there are a ton of items and details I forgot to include in the list. 

It has a ton of power and will outrun alot of the bigger kids bikes out there (XR100, TTR-110 etc)

It was professionally built so every detail was addressed and put together RIGHT. 

The bike/chassis only has about 50 hours on it when I bought it and then was taken apart and the race motor and suspension was installed.
