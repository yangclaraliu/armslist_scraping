These saw cut kits are getting very hard to find as all kits are now torched beyond recognition and you don't even get barrels with them nowadays due to stricter import regulations.

This kit has not seen the light of day in a little over 15 years.

This kit is complete with a functioning full auto lower, bolt (extractor and ejector included) and barrel. 

Model ""A"" ratchet top and barrel nut.

Metal folding stock.

Receiver has been cut to BATF specs so this is a LEGAL to own non - gun. 

NO FFL is needed to possess this non - gun.

Anyone may own this kit in it's current state.

For those of you who possess a class 3, the receiver (which is only missing a very tiny section) could very easily be repaired with a repair channel which are readily available or a McKay industries semi auto receiver for those of you who don't.

Or this would make a really nice display with a dummy receiver.

This means all NFA rules apply

With that being said feel free to make a cash offer or trade or cash with trade.

I like and will trade for other tactical weapons such as AK's / AR's / Pistols and large caliber rifles or unique weapons. They don't have to be safe queens, I only ask that they be functional.

Details on this model from Tikka's website:

TIKKA T3 TAC

When it comes to accuracy, the Tikka T3 TAC is in a class of its own. The free-floating barrel is made of match-grade Cr-Mo steel, and manufactured by a precision cold-hammer forging process by Sako craftsmen. The action and the barrel surfaces are Manganese-phosphatized for lasting protection against the elements and wear. The barrel features protected muzzle threading, providing attachment for optional Sako muzzle brake or suppressor assembly.

The modern bolt has two front locking lugs and a spring-loaded reliable operation. The Teflon coating on the bolt ensures a non-reflecting surface and a smooth bolt throw. The 2-way safety behind the bolt handle locks both the bolt and the trigger. The trigger unit is adjustable with a hand-honed sear/trigger - without creep. A single set trigger is optional.

The Picatinny rail on top of the action takes any Weaver or U.S. Mil.Std 1913 compatible mounts. New phospatized Tikka Optilock bases and rings are recommended for maximum accuracy and ease of use.

The detachable straight-feeding single column magazine is silent, durable and non-rusting. The standard 5-round magazines are tailored to each caliber for ultimate reliability and performance.

The stock is made of fiberglass reinforced copolymer polypropylene and features an ambidextrous palm swell. The wide fore-end has a swivel stud to take a bipod. The three sides of the stock are fitted with inserts which allow the use of heavy duty hook-type sling swivels. The recoil pad is of black rubber and the length of pull may be adjusted with spacers. The cheek piece is adjustable at 5 mm intervals, up to 25 mm (1”)"

*Trigger group moved forward, Tapco single hook G2 trigger group (3 compliant parts)
*Tapco Retaining plate
*New disconnector spring
*MD Arms Molot grip (1 compliant part)
*SGM Tacitcal Quad Rail (1 compliant part)
*Magpul AFG
*K-VAR Warsaw length buttstock w/ cleaning kit (1 compliant part)

     This Saiga AK is built from ALL HIGH QUALITY PARTS. Less than 50 rounds through it. There are over $200 worth of conversion parts and the  major gunsmithing work is already done! All you need to complete this tactical AK is an SGM tactical 30 Round Magazine and a good red-dot or whatever you prefer. Again, these are all high quality parts. SGM tactical and K-VAR make outstanding gear, this is a weapon you can take to the feild that will not fail you. The Tapco G2 trigger is nice and clean with a crisp break. If you've ever fired a regular AK trigger you will instantly be in love when you feel the difference.

Can you get a WASR cheaper? Yes. Is it a true soviet made brand spankin' new AK with high quality upgrades? No. You get what you pay for...and you are paying for a high quality, true Kalashnikov rifle. At this price, and with the furniture this weapon has, I have lost money, and you have a free conversion....this is a deal you won't find elsewhere.

   In it's current configuration this weapon has 6 compliant parts and meets compliance. An American magazine will give you a total of 9 compliant parts. I am not sure if the magpul AFG counts as one 

 Will possibly consider trades for a Glock Pistol plus cash. Let me know what you have. Looking for something in the $400-450 range. Trade value of my rifle will be $700 for the purposes of any trades.

78,http://www.armslist.com/posts/145078,For Sale:  NEW Flat-Top AR-15 / M-4 with Quad-rail Gas Block!!!,"Southwest Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma",$ 775,"Listed On: Thursday, June 23, 2011",Rifles,Rock River Arms                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This AR-15 / M-4 has a flawless Aero Precision lower (I just changed to it, but the pictures don't yet reflect the new lower.) with a Rock River Arms parts set in it, as well as a Rock River Arms 6-position collapsible stock.  I installed a Hogue rubber grip on it (if you have not used a rifle with a Hogue grip, you don't know what you are missing!).

The upper is an Anchor-Harvey flat-top with a Picatinny rail system that has numbered stations so that if you remove an optic, you can easily replace it at exactly the same spot.  It comes with an M-4 style detachable carry handle/rear sight.

I have also installed a MagPul MOE front handguard.  It is the beefy one that they made before they started making the thinner ones that fit over gas-piston systems.

The upper has a quad-rail gas block so that any optic you mount to the flat-top upper will not be staring into the back of the fixed front sight post!  This quad-rail gas block also allows the mounting of virtually anything you would like to it: lasers, lights, custom sling mounts (either bottom or side), and even bi-pods.  You can also mount a pop-up front iron sight on it as well. 

Speaking of slings, this weapon comes with a black nylon G.I. sling and a ProMag Picatinny Rail Sling Mount.

Of course it has the flash suppressor that doubles as a compensator (since the bottom is solid instead of having openings in it).  This also keeps the muzzle blast from kicking up so much dust if you are firing it from the prone position. 

THIS WEAPONS IS NEW AND UNFIRED.  I bought the lower and upper separate and put them together myself, then installed the Hogue rubber grip and the MagPul handguard.  I did this because I couldn't find all of those features on any complete gun under $1000. 

This is my personal AR, but I am willing to part with it because I need the cash.  I am only asking $775 for it.  If you have any questions or want any other pics, please let me know.

Unlike some models that EOTech makes, it uses AA batteries which are readily available everywhere in the world.  

It not only comes with the original cardboard box and instructions, but it also comes with a genuine Pelican waterproof case!  The sight has been stored in this case since I bought it.

Once I put batteries in it to make sure it worked, and I mounted it to a Picatinny rail to make sure it would fit, then I took it off and put it into its Pelican case, where it stayed until I took it out to photograph it.

It has a built-in mount that will fit either Picatinny or Weaver rails.

It also comes with the Allen wrench and bolt for replacing the knurled knob with a less-obtrusive Allen-head bolt.

Yes, it looks like there is a scratch on the battery cover in the pictures, but it is really just a cat hair (I know, how embarrassing...)

If you have any questions, please let me know!

THE PICTURES BELOW ARE NOT THE ACTUAL FIREARM.  I SNAGGED THEM FROM GUNBROKER.  I DON'T HAVE THE PISTOL IN FRONT OF ME TO TAKE A PICTURE.  IF SOMEONE IS INTERESTED AND WANTS TO SEE THE ACTUAL PISTOL, I WILL HAVE TO GO TO HIS PLACE AND TAKE SOME PICTURES.

This pistol is very low round count.  Most of the rounds fired were when he was with me at the range.  I'm estimating less than 500.  That's a high estimate.

It looks exactly like the one pictured.  $300 is what he's gotta have for this.  Pistol, 2 full-capacity mags, Laserlyte, box and everything that came in it.

The sale will go through me, ftf with valid PTC or PTP, no exceptions."

This is a very good firearm that is really a big Hipower with a S&W style double action trigger and decocker/saftey. Blued, all carbon steel, and reliable as an axe. It has a few small marks on the left side of frame, otherwise very nice. Unlike several friend's high dollar K****r .45s, this gun is not at all picky about reloads or bullet configuration. It will shoot anything you have in .45 acp with no hiccups period. You can bet your life on this piece.

This gun has not been re-blued and is in original as seen condition.

I found several blogs discussing the merits of this gun.  It’s true they don’t make them like this any more.

Made in Belgium when quality and reputation stood for something.

The Challenger .22 Caliber Pistol was introduced in 1962 and ceased production in 1985. 

This is a fine shooting and functioning well made gun.  An absolute dream to shoot.  Big front blade sight makes it easy to hit 25 yrd plus targets.

Condition of the gun is much better than one would expect for a gun of this age.  Im not a gun-grader but this is really clean.  very slight wear on the thumb release of the slide.  

This is the one you will pass down to your children’s children.

Comes with what is pictured.

Face to face only, or buyer pays all shipping and handling related expenses.


Will trade for:

1- browning buck mark 
1- nice double action .22 revolver 
2- clean, functional double action .22 revolvers
1- glock 22 or 23 
1- kel-tec sub 2000 in glock .40

If you are using a handgun or high powered rifle for home defense, you are putting your family and neighbors at risk. For home defense, you need a shotgun that will work every time. You need a mossberg 590sp

I am selling my Mossberg 590SP (special purpose) 12 gauge. This gun is pristine and it is the best home defense gun you can have. I am not big on Mossbergs but when they made the 590SP and 590A, they got it right. 

The gun is smooth, light, and the parkerized finish is nothing to sneeze at. I have the stock on it, but I will also include a pistol grip that cuts down the size considerably. 

If you are concerned with home defense and you have a pistol next to your bed, you may as well leave you door unlocked. If the lights are out, you are sleeping with your family in the house, you want to know you are protected from any threat. 

The extended magazine on the 590sp guarantees that you are not going to run out of shells before the fight is over. The gun has a reasonable kick that a wife can handle and if you live in close quarters, the only thing you want protecting you house is a shot gun. 

This gun is basically brand new. I think a total of 10 rounds have been fired through it. I have a Saiga and a couple other guns and I just dont need this one. I took it to the range yesterday and put 2 rounds through it to make sure it was in working order, and honestly, it made me want to not sell it, but I have to. 

This is a private sale, but young kids and gangbangers need not apply. If I dont like the way you look or act, you are not getting it. 

NO LOW BALLERS. - I know you can find the gun online for $366 but after transfer fees, background check, taxes, you are up over $400. Do bother contacting me with a crazy offer. I am not desperate, I just don't need this gun and I want it to go to a good home. 

If you have any questions, please email me."

Comes with the original colt wood grips, 1 older MecGar mag, 1 Chip McCormick Shooting Star mag, the black rubber Pearce grips you see installed, the old grip screws and an extra set of bushings, and an Uncle Mike's #5 holster, 100 rounds on Winchester white box, and 50 rounds of CCI Blazer.  $1200 cash FTF.  May consider partial trades.  Call or text at REDACTED.  Thanks for looking!

The Sccy CPX-1 is a 9mm double action only (DAO) semiautomatic pistol, produced by Sccy Industries, (formerly known as Skyy Industries). It feeds from a staggered column removable 10 round box magazine. It has a polymer frame with a stainless steel barrel and slide, which lock open when the last round is fired. The Sccy CPX-1 entered the firearms market in 2005 as, then SKYY Industries’ pilot product. The CPX-1's size makes it an attractive choice for a concealment weapon, as a result this pistol has found support in the US concealed carry community. Concealed Carry Magazine gave it a positive review in its June 2006 issue. Sccy has just released, as of October 2010, the CPX-2, which only varies from the CPX-1 through its lack of safety levers and its redesigned polymer frame."

It is 2-tone, with very nice factory aluminum grips.  It also has the factory laser that can mount beneath the frame.
It has very bright night sights.  These are real night sights, and not just a notch in the frame.  This is a very accurate gun and it shoots soft.  This is not your typical .380.  It is accurate out to 25 yards, it is very controllable, and comfortable to shoot.  It is reliable and was function tested with Winchester ball and Corbon hollow point ammo.  This is a single action pistol, carried cocked and locked just like the full size 1911.
The package is just as it came from Sig: Gun, one magazine, laser, holster, and hard case.

It was the last of the Romanian Rifles that were imported with the magazine dimples, so Magazine wobble is non-existant.  I bought it from a man whom I believe only fired it a few times.  When I got it it was dirty, but it still had the factory grease inside of it.  I've put maybe 200 rds through it.  It's a super nice and reliable rifle.

Now for the package.  It comes with the Romanian wire folding stock (these are near impossible to find), a tapco M4 style collapsible stock, and the original wood stock.  It also comes with a Promag side scope mount that is easily attached/removed.  Five Bulgarian 30 rd steel magazines, one ribbed steel magazine (unknown type), and one Bulgarian polymer 40 rd magazine.

It also comes with 160 rds of steel cased 7.62x39 and a 1,120rd case of Yugoslavian surplus 7.62x39 ammunition on 10 rd stripper clips in a green wooden crate. (https://www.samcoglobal.com/Ammo-762x39.html)."

It was /is used by the Romanian Army as a Squad designated marksman rifle.
It's a pretty rifle and it's chambered in 7.62x54R, so it'll be really cheap to shoot.  I bougt it from a guy who got it new and it hasn't had many rounds through it.  I myself have never shot it, I just brought it home, cleaned it up, and put it in the gun safe.  I like it and don't really want to part with it, but I need money to fund another project.....so this one's on the ""chopping block""."
