Chambered for the .357 Magnum, the Magnum Carry is similar to a beefed up Detective Special and while small, still chambers 6 rounds. Constructed of stainless steel, it is fitted with a 2"" barrel, fixed sights, and comfortable wrap-around rubber grips. There is a transfer bar safety incorporated. This revolver is in excellent, like new, condition. I'd grade it 98-99% overall, no signs of wear. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent. It comes in the Colt Custom Shop blue box. The original plain white outer sleeve is missing, but the end flap with original label is included. Also comes with the original owner's manual, hang tag, and miscellaneous paperwork. This is a scarce revolver and a quite a prize for the Colt collector!"

I am also selling an Anschutz 6835 sight kit.  I am asking $800 for the rifle and sight kit together, however rifle will go to the highest offer, and move quickly - its not often that these rifles come onto the market in this condition. This price is firm; the rifle is in pristine condition and has been extremely well cared for, and it has enough sentimental value for me to keep it if my price is not met.

Anschutz makes the best .22LR target rifles in the world.  The 64 MP is an entry level target rifle intended for use in small varmint hunting, and three position rifle competition. This particular 64 MP has a beautiful dark walnut stock, and a stainless steel .920 bull barrel.  The rifle is perfectly balanced just in front of the trigger guard.  It comes with a 5 round magazine, and a polymer single shot chamber adapter that allows single rounds to be inserted directly into the chamber.  

The rifle uses Anschutz's custom 5018 trigger. The 5018 is a two stage adjustable trigger that can be adjusted with a screwdriver without disassembling the rifle. It can be adjusted as light as 2 oz and as high as 6 lbs. 

The rifle has been VERY lightly used (less than 300 rounds through it) and has been extremely well cared for. It has been thoroughly cleaned after every range date, and cleaned and oiled before being put away for long term storage.  The sights are peep style and are Anschutz's best model, and are already installed on the weapon.

Transfer is on the buyer. If you're not in the 'Burgh I'll ship to your FFL for an additional fee. Sorry but can't do trades... got a new toy to pay for!

I guarantee that this 1911 is mint."

This unique design is a cross between the Hakim rifle (evolved from the Swedish Ljungman) and the Russian SKS. It uses the basic operating system and stock design of the Hakim, but incorporates the exposed barrel, front sight and folding knife bayonet popular with the Soviet Union, as well as use of their 7.62x39mm cartridge. 

Has original 10 round magazine. , a very good example of a very scarce rifle, with something like only 6,000-8,000 total production and only about 2,000 brought into the USA. This carbine is a key piece for the “assault rifle” collector or someone interested in Egyptian arms or arms of the Middle East."

it has 1 clip very nice condition overall.  $225

Iver & Johnson Sealed 8
this gun is non functioning, it's a part gun!  it was a 6 or 8 inch barrel that is cut down.  cylinder is good, as well as hammer and I would imagine a lot more of the internal parts are in good shape,  most parts work in a model 68 as well.  $75 

FIE TIGER .38

I still have everything for it: The original carrying case, paperwork, different grip sizes for comfort, pistol lock and key, barrel plug and two magazines 17+1. The gun ALSO comes with the Insight M6X tactical laser/light combo which mounts under the gun. I still have the original case for the light and the light comes with extra batteries and an extra bulb. This gun ALSO comes with a leg holster. I will say this though, the leg holster was not made for this pistol, though it does work, it doesn't work as good as it should. But I'm sure a few tweaks would make it fit perfectly, I was just too lazy to actually do it. I'm asking $600 for everything. I believe I have shot this gun 4 times with each time putting about 50 rounds through it. This is literally a new gun and has been kept up. The gun itself new is $569 and the light itself is $320. Together with tax you are easily looking at $900+. I'm asking $600 for EVERYTHING. This is the best I can do and if you do your research, you'll know this is a great deal."

The Practical Pro Katana has an extended tsuka and a thicker and longer (29) Performance Series blade with a finer polish when compared to others in the Practical series. Designed for multiple cuts in normal targets, the blade of the practical pro is forged in high-carbon steel with an armor peircing spear tip, and is clay-baked to give the edge proper hardness for a razor sharp edge. While the area of steel behind the clay baked edge is softer providing spring. The rayskin-covered tsuka is wrapped with synthetic black leather and is double-pegged for practical, functional use. The saya is finished in a deep black lacquer with a black Japanese cotton sageo. The katana features a Kuruma tsuba, which represents the Wheel of Dharma, symbolizing the Buddhist concept of the Noble Eightfold Path.

The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached. The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for it's owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (included) or a manual safety (installed) by a simple parts change. The gun comes with two 16rnd magazines, cleaning brush and rod, case, manual, and the decocking lever (not installed). Please feel free to contact me with any questions you have."

This shotgun is a BLAST to shoot, but I need money for other projects.

Fully converted Saiga 12 gauge shotgun meets 922R compliance with KVAR US-made Warsaw-length buttstock, Tapco trigger group and Molot-style US-made pistol grip. Trigger guard is from Carolina Shooter Supply. The shotgun has been converted and recoated to protect the metal. It features an 18.5"" barrel with threaded muzzle and thread protector.

The bolt, carrier and hammer have been polished and profiled for perfect operation with birdshot, buckshot and slugs. THIS GUN WILL CYCLE BIRDSHOT! A lot of Saigas don't run right but this has had the time taken to be tuned for reliability! It will cycle most budget loads on gas setting 1 (low gas). The bolt has also been profiled to ease the insertion of a full magazine! It takes some practice to do, but is the best that can be accomplished without an aftermarket magazine well.

The gun will cycle most birdshot loads over 1200 FPS with ease. I have tested Winchester Universal and Federal Game Loads, which are both under $6 a box at Walmart. This is the cheapest 12 gauge ammo I have found.

ph: 931. seveno3. 3444 

Details:

The Pro Hunter™ muzzleloader will forever change how we think about muzzleloading rifles. The Pro Hunter™ muzzleloader features the same Swing Hammer® design, engraved receiver and precision barrel as the Pro Hunter™ rifle. Like todays high tech muzzleloaders, the Omega and Encore, it’s simple to operate, easy to load and quick to clean. Until now, it took longer to remove and clean the breech plug than it did to clean the barrel.

Speed Breech™ 

The Speed Breech™ is a quick release breech plug (patent-pending) that can be removed by rotating it only 90 degrees. No longer do you have to struggle with seized breech plugs or the time-consuming chore of making eleven rotations to remove your breech plug. Three gas compression rings on the face of the breech plug eliminates 95% of harmful blowback. “Speed Breech™…90° and out” 

E-Z Tip Extractor™

This solid one-piece extractor features an all-steel design, and can be rotated to either the left or right hand side to allow easy access to the Speed Breech™. The Pro Hunter™ muzzleloader does not have to be disassembled to remove the breech plug and there are no screws to loosen to pivot the extractor. Simply rotate the extractor to one side or the other. There is a plunger on the bottom of the lug that locks the extractor into place when it is rotated to its upright position. This assures perfect alignment with the Speed Breech™. The extractor also operates as a safety mechanism to assure the Speed Breech™ is locked into position. If the Speed Breech™ is not locked into position the extractor will not drop into the machined recess of the breech plug and will prevent the gun from closing.

T/C’s Power Rod®

The patented pivoting handle is integral with the solid aluminum ramrod. This convenient low profile handle eliminates the need for a palm saver or T-handle and makes loading your rifle quicker and less painful. The Power Rod® allows the hunter to load his rifle in the field more uniformly by applying the same seating pressure shot after shot. Hunters using the Powder Rod® can now enjoy the same accuracy they get at the range using a range rod.

FlexTech® Technology

Recoil reduction technology that features a soft touch comb that takes the bite out of muzzle rise, while the smooth surface finish allows the cheek to slide forward during firing. Over molded finger grooves in the stock and rubber grill pads in the forend give you firm control of the rifle in both wet and dry conditions. Sing swivel studs are molded into the stock and forend to eliminate the possibility of pulling out. T/C’s FlexTech® system is just one of the many advancements given to the new Pro Hunter™."

 Be it prairie dog hunting in Texas, whitetail hunting in Maine or elk hunting in Colorado, the Colt LE901-16S™ is the rifle for the hunt. Chambered in the classic .308 Winchester cartridge, the LE901-16S is the perfect choice for medium to large sized game animals. Exceptional accuracy is assured by its full floated, 16.1” chrome lined barrel and one-piece monolithic upper receiver, suitable for mounting your optic of choice. Keeping the varmint hunter in mind, the .308 Winchester upper receiver group can be easily swapped out for any Mil-Spec Colt upper receiver chambered in 5.56x45 NATO. The fact that all operating controls are ambidextrous, including the magazine release, bolt catch and safety selector, makes for versatility and ease of use. You can depend on the new Colt LE901-16S to take the shot of your lifetime!

This one does include the famous ""gill"" slide serrations. Essentially its a precursor to the gen4, but with gen 3 internals in addition to the gen 3 sized grip with aggressive texture. I bought it expecting to transition to the Glock family and wanted the texture without the Gen 4 (has't been vetted long enough for me to buy into it) however I do not foresee myself transitioning to it as my serious use/training/nightstand firearms. As Such I figured would through my hat in the ring and see if anyone out there is interested in a Glock variant that is getting a little harder to find these days. 

Details:
-Glock 17 RTF2 with just under 100 WWB rounds through it, includes 2 factory mags, box, lock, bore brush and paperwork (everything it came with)
-PEW prefix serial number (11-29-2010 test fire date)
-Not looking to travel to far from the Springs, but feel free to contact me we may be able to work something out.
-Price is rather solid as it is like new and I am in no need to move it, however interesting trades are welcome and all trades will be considered 

Thank you for taking the time to look, feel free to ask any questions about the firearm, or posit any offers. I will also try to accommodate an photo requests. If interested I will be using a bill of sale with legitimate drivers licence required at the time of sale (to protect you and me, also to act as a receipt), and obviously one should be 21+ with no legal history or reasoning that would prohibit them the legal ownership, possession, and use of firearms. Price is pretty firm, though all reasonable offers and trades will be considered.

Official Product Description:

Night Vision: ITT Night Quest 260 Generation III Binocular

ITT has been the world leader in night vision equipment development since their inception in 1959 and are now the sole supplier to the U.S. Military. Proven by U.S. and Allied Forces in Operation Desert Storm, ITT's Generation 3 night vision products are light years ahead of the surplus Russian equipment being pawned at army surplus stores. 404 precision engineered processes go into the assembly and manufacturing of each viewer. Several features set ITT's products apart from anything else on the market. These are: a state-of-the-art image intensifier tube with their unique MCP (microchannel plate) which contains over 6,000,000 microchannels. Each channel is 20 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Covering the microchannel plate is a thin protective film that's less than 100 atoms thick. The phosphor screen has a resolution 20 times higher than the typical television set, and all night vision products are sealed under clean-room conditions in such an ultra-high vacuum state that no other manufacturer can compare. The end result is clarity and resolution unmatched by others.
Night Quest 250/260

Compact, lightweight and weather resistant, the 250/260 binocular is a vital visual aid for peace of mind. These units were tested to rigid military specifications and were used in Desert Storm. Ideal for search and rescue, security and recreation, the Night Quest comes in both G2 and G3 Models. Superior clarity and resolution even in extremely low-light conditions allows the Model 250/260 to capture even the slightest speck of starlight to provide excellent night-time viewing. Ruggedly constructed, water resistant and lightweight (26 ounces), the Model 250/260 is easy to handle and has automatic gain control and electronic focus. The units feature F/1.4 optics and a 40° field of view. Runs on a 6V lithium camera battery.

Did a little research and realized I was coming in high. Sorry about that.

This combo has been a great learning tool for my kids. I’m selling it reluctantly, but she-who-must-be-obeyed says it has to go if I want to equip the eldest with a competition rifle. So here we go…

This is a single-shot, break action combo with a .22 rifle barrel and a .410 shotgun barrel. The rifle barrel has relatively nice partridge sights and obviously can take .22 short as well (a nice feature for noise levels). The shotgun barrel is smoothbore with the customary front bead sight. The trigger breaks cleanly at 5.5 lbs, which I have found to be good for kids learning safety. It’s not a target trigger, obviously, but these aren’t target sights either and it does teach control. 

I’m also including an extra-short buttstock I made. Some of these “youth” stocks apparently have rather large youths in mind. Young girls frequently need something shorter, and in this case it is included. It is easy to change with a ½” socket on an extension. Another benefit of this is that the shorter stock allows for a substantial recoil pad for learning shotgun. It is good to avoid teaching kids to flinch! (That part isn’t included, but any strap-on recoil pad should work.) 

This combo has very few rounds through it, mostly because we ended up spending so much more time with an air rifle. Consequently it is in very nice shape. It also comes with a well-thought-out padded nylon carry case. Maybe now would be a good time to think ahead toward the holidays? Or a first hunting season?

First off thanks for viewing my Ad !! I'm guessing you found me because you're concerned for you or your familys safety? Maybe you just want to be prepared for when the stuff hits the fan via natraul disaster or war? either way you're in the right place to get what you need!!!

I am a veteran and have been prepping myself for almost 10 years now and its somethingIi love doing so I figured why not turn a hobby I love doing and help others get prepared for anything unexpected. This bag is primarily a 72 hour advanced recon kit(ARK). I can customize a bag to fit your certain needs if this exact setup doesn't suit you.  I make it a primary focus to keep my family safe so I never leave without mine. 

OVER 150 ITEMS!!!!

A quick overview of why it is a smart investment to have a survival bag.
Every previous empire in history has collapsed. Is the USA different? All others thought they were too smart or too powerful to collapse. Look around you and you will see the signs that overpopulation on the Earth is unsustainable. Our dependency on fossil fuels is unsustainable. Our current financial system is unsustainable.

15 and 30 round magazine. Minor dings on butt of rifle but very very little metal wear.  This is a great rifle, they don't keep making crappy rifles for 70 years. Im not really interested in trades, too much money tied up in guns right now. I am however looking to sell quick so make me an offer. Any questions just ask. Low ball offers will not warrant a response. I said quick sale, not stupid sale. Im willing to drive a little but I will not ship and will not sell to anybody with a CA DL. Thanks for looking."
