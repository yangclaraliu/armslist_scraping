These are the russian copy of the dragunov. This one has been dura-coated in White with snow gray to create a break up snow pattern of sorts. I have the orignal scope that come on the gun. It currently has a Promag side mount, weaver rings and a sightron S2 big sky 3x9x42 scope with duplex recticle. Scope is just as clear as can be and has be boresighted but not shot on the range to be fully sighted in. About 40 rounds have gone thru this gun to set the iron sights. With the side mount scope both sights can be used. 

 I have seen online thru a few different places that you can buy a PSL 54 for about 500 before FFL transfer fee. Ones with the orignal scope go for about 650 or so on gunrbroker. I have the orignal scope and a new mount/scope set up on this. If you want an iron sight PSL 54 for 500 by all means look up one of those sites. This one is not for sale at that price. The S2 Scope alone goes for $380 on midwayusa.com new.

Varmint-rifle performance and accuracy in a double action revolver. That’s what you get with our unique Raging Accuracy series. They are built with the same massively strong design as our Raging Bull™ 454 Casull revolver, with a signature bright Hornet Yellow grip insert. They feature dual cylinder lockup, eight-shot capacity, and a heavy unported 10-inch barrel for maximum shooting stability. The Raging Hornet comes in .22 Hornet and when fired, barely moves in your hand. Each gun is drop hammer forged and comes fully equipped with precision-adjustable open sights—but to get truly Raging Accuracy you’ll want to use the included new Taurus Scope Mount Base to fit a high-magnification scope.

I gave quite a bit for this setup and have taken several deer with it. I don't think I can bowhunt this year, so I may as well get rid of it to someone that can. It's a nice setup and guaranteed to make deer put their hooves up in the air and surrender at the very site of it

Round count is around 200 and it is in excellent condition. These pistols will work for recreational shooting but are primarily designed for concealed carry/personal defense. Weight is around 19 oz unloaded, and can carry 12+1 9mm rounds. Yet it is still very compact and slim in the grip for ease of discreet carry. Comes with box, and two magazines. Sight cuts are made so that Trijicon night sights can be easily installed if that is your choice later down the road. This is an excellent pistol, I just like trying out new firearms. Asking price is 350.

     I am looking to buy a Sig Sauer P228 immediately. I have owned two in the past and wound up trading them (wish I hadn't now, I attached a photo of one I used to own). Anyway, I am leaving for training soon and this will be the weapon platform I am trained on. I would like to spend the next month refamiliarizing myself with the weapon so i have a leg up when I get to training. I have cash in hand and am not looking to waste anybody's time. I would use gunbroker, but I don't want to have to take the time to coordinate with an FFL nor do I want to wait for the shipping. My only requirement is that it be in good functional condition. I am not worried about holster wear or a mark here and there. I would prefer the Sig brand 13rd mags, but the 10rd'rs would be fine too. I would also prefer it to have the original case with it, but this is not a deal breaker if it doesn't. Please call or e-mail if you have one to sell and we will go from there. Thanks.

This is a great package.  

The 2nd gen Glock was the best!  Look around; you wont find many because they've been swiped up.  This gun is meant for carry so no rail needed (try to find a concealed carry holster that accepts a light/laser and doesn't print).  The 2nd gen has a more tapered muzzle area so it's a faster draw and easier to reholster.  The grip is textured with no grooves so any hand will fit.  Because this was my carry gun it has holster wear.  Glock will refinish it for $50 but these aren't meant to be pretty so no need.  I have put less than 500 rounds through the gun and I always cleaned and maintained it.  87 of those rounds were Rem 180gr Golden Saber.  I made sure they ran in the gun and kept the last 13 of the 100 for carry.  I'm including them because this gun loves them and now you don't have to spend $100 to test SD loads.  Sights are still pretty bright - I'd say at least 80% because I actually can't tell the difference from the new ones on my 1911.  This gun handles recoil very well and is extremely accurate.  

I called Glock and they said just drop it in a UPS or FedEX box and mail to them with a check.  You get it back in new condition in about 2 weeks.  Like I said though, carry guns get rub marks and Glocks are built for reliability not beauty so it was not a priority for me.

BTW The holster has the paddle attachment - I just forgot to put it on for the photo.  You will get that too.

Thanks!

Extreme conditions call for an extreme gun. And never before has a rifle this durable and rugged been introduced to the world of hunting. The cutting edge in rifle design, the Model 700 XCR (Xtreme Conditions Rifle) uses Remington's proprietary new TriNyte™ Corrosion Control System to make the Model 700 XCR virtually impervious to even the most extreme conditions. The TriNyte System takes firearm protection further than it's ever been before by using proven corrosion-fighting materials and an innovative, state-of-the-art application process. The result is a finish that provides scratch and corrosion resistance far superior to stainless steel alone and better than any other gun on the market.
Designed for shooters by shooters, the Model 700 XCR is built for superior handling in adverse conditions. Its feature laden synthetic stock is not only stylish and comfortable, but a technological marvel. Features include an R3® recoil pad from Limbsaver™ — the most effective recoil pad produced today — and patented rubber overmolding technology from Hogue® — a revolutionary technique incorporated into the grip and fore-end areas to provide the surest grip even in the slickest environments. The new standard in rugged durability, the Model 700 XCR Xtreme Conditions Rifle will have you delivering your appointed rounds while the others stay home.

Matte black finish, 3"" chamber and fully rifled cantilever barrel.  Very accurate shotgun that shoots sub 3"" groups at 200 yards with Hornady SST 2 3/4"" sabots for me.


Add a low-profile, Weaver-style cantilever scope mount to a rifled 22"" barrel and you’ll have the most accurate pump-action slug gun available. The solid cantilever mount keeps the scope firmly connected to the barrel, ensuring the scope stays sighted in while allowing the shotgun to easily be taken down for cleaning. The composite stock with raised comb is ideal for medium eye-relief scopes that provide exceptional field of view.

From Taser's web site:
The technologically advanced TASER C2 is designed for your personal safety needs. Utilizing the same technology as our proven law enforcement models, it offers incredible take down power and unparalleled protection right in the palm of your hand.

TASER C2 is an Electronic Control Device (ECD) that delivers an incapacitating pulse that overrides the sensory and motor functions of the nervous system. This powerful Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (NMI) technology can stop even the most aggressive individuals, including those under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.

The C2 uses a replaceable cartridge containing inert, compressed nitrogen to fire two small probes that are attached to 15 foot (4.5 meter) insulated conductive wires. Energy is sent over the wires into the probes, which can penetrate up to two cumulative inches of clothing. The charge is transmitted between the two probes, jamming sensory and motor functions, and inhibiting muscular control. This NMI effect continues in 30-second cycles each time you press the trigger. The C2 can also be used as a direct contact stun device.


Advanced Features
15 ft. (4.5 m) range allows you to stop an attacker before s/he gets to you 
30 second electrical pulse allows you time to safely escape danger or keep an attacker down 
Bold laser sighting system helps you aim confidently and accurately 
Integrated LED light illuminates dark places to improve your line of vision 
Compact, lightweight design allows it to be easily and discreetly carried everywhere you go 
Long-lasting Lithium Power Magazine allows over 50 uses, ensuring you have power when you need it most"

From Taser's web site:
The technologically advanced TASER C2 is designed for your personal safety needs. Utilizing the same technology as our proven law enforcement models, it offers incredible take down power and unparalleled protection right in the palm of your hand.

TASER C2 is an Electronic Control Device (ECD) that delivers an incapacitating pulse that overrides the sensory and motor functions of the nervous system. This powerful Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (NMI) technology can stop even the most aggressive individuals, including those under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.

The C2 uses a replaceable cartridge containing inert, compressed nitrogen to fire two small probes that are attached to 15 foot (4.5 meter) insulated conductive wires. Energy is sent over the wires into the probes, which can penetrate up to two cumulative inches of clothing. The charge is transmitted between the two probes, jamming sensory and motor functions, and inhibiting muscular control. This NMI effect continues in 30-second cycles each time you press the trigger. The C2 can also be used as a direct contact stun device.


Advanced Features
15 ft. (4.5 m) range allows you to stop an attacker before s/he gets to you 
30 second electrical pulse allows you time to safely escape danger or keep an attacker down 
Bold laser sighting system helps you aim confidently and accurately 
Integrated LED light illuminates dark places to improve your line of vision 
Compact, lightweight design allows it to be easily and discreetly carried everywhere you go 
Long-lasting Lithium Power Magazine allows over 50 uses, ensuring you have power when you need it most"

I spoke with the local gun shop here and he said 500-600 is a FAIR price for this gun

if you check the link below and go to the bottom of the list of guns you will see some Stoeger Lugers and the exact same model as mine is at the bottom of the list for $1,500+ with that said the reason mine is so low is the carry wear on it from the years .....bore is still real good on it and it is in good working order.
