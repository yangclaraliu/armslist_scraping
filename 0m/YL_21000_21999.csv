FROM SIGSAUER.COM--
The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

I have had this gun for some time and have put about 150 rounds through it with no problems the gun appears to have not been fired much at all the innards are pretty free from wear and the gummy buffer is in great shape. 

What I am interested in are no long guns. A pistol of some sort in .40, 9mm, or .38spl/.357. I have run through my mind possible trades that I am interested in one of the big ones would be a Taurus 709 slim  It will come with 11 sten mags 10 of which I havent really tested but were all surplus they have been de-cosmolined and a few have little rust spots but all appear to be functional some appear to be new. 

To me its a cool SHTF gun but I really would get more every day use out of something a little more practical. That is my only reason for wanting to trade so PM me if you are interested... be creative.."

AR-15_A1 Pre-Ban - Factory issue 5.56mm PWA Commando w/Colt barrel.
This AR is not for everyone. It is a collectors item. There are a few people out there who understand what an early issue pre-ban is and understand my price for this AR.  I want a rifle to go to the range every month, I cannot put that kind of rounds through this collectors piece. Serious inquiries only.

Upper: Colt 20-inch barrel 1:9 twist w/ bayonet lug. Barrel marked ""C MP Chrome Bore""; C for the manufacturer Colt, MP stamp means the barrel was magnafluxed and proofed, chrome bore and chamber. Bolt Carrier manufacturer stamp ""Shield (8 sided octagon) and SE""; Smith Enterprise. Bolt carrier group parts are in excellent shape; NO pitting, cracks, chips, scratches,  or scaring.

Lower: PWA (Pac West Arms, Milan, Ill.; this was the early LMT company I believe and Rock River Arms bought out PWA. From everything that I have heard they are excellent lowers!) 5.56mm Commando. This is a forged lower not cast.  Serial# 11174. (PWA post-ban have a year prefix in the serial number. The serial # cutoff was 35222 for preban status).

Standard two point sling and A1 stock w/ butt storage compartment. Has a new AR-16 cleaning kit (Small Arms Maintenance Equipment Case 8465-00-781-9564).  Have one USA 30 round AR-15 .223 magazine by O'Kay Industries, Inc., New Britain, Conn.

Just spent $144.00 at a gunsmith making sure this is in excellent working order. I had it fully serviced (new parts, fired & cleaned) by a gunsmith at Anderson's Gun Repair Shop here in Springfield, MO before putting it up for sale; new extractor spring & gas tube. I also run some 120 rounds through it and cleaned it. It was flawless.

It has the nice M4 feed ramps and a 1:9 twist barrel. I'm not interested in shooting open sights, so I did a little surgery on the front post and set it up with a scope. I know I didn't need to, since it disappears in a scope, but I like the look of it. I cut it off and painted the metal with high temp BBQ paint..doesn't look bad. If you want one with a front post, or with a better gas block set-up, it could have another one put on. It wears a Burris Fullfield 3x9-40 in a one piece hi rise RRA mount right now. The gun has not been fired since I put the scope on it. And the scope has never been on a gun before this one. I'll also include one 30 rd Pmag. I have the literature and boxes for the gun and scope. I have ammo available as well if need be.

If CMMG has these available, they're 600 plus shipping and transfer, so $650ish. You'll get no mag, and not know what you are getting. This one is nice, and runs well. 

I'd like to sell the package as a whole, and would take $750 for it.
