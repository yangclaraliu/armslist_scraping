With all that is going on with anticipated high cap bans,  and a production freez on these from Glock which can be verified through Glock. Also, the few I found left on this site are cheap Korean junk and going between 80 and 100 dollars each and a few that were used and beat to death the same price.

If you can find them to start with, and can find them cheaper, just buy them! I dont want to hear about it! I sold out in less than an hour at this price with the first bunch from my stash Thursday. You will wish you had jumped on these soon enough. Thank you for taking the time."

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."

This has the three lug barrel with the fake can pinned/welded to conform to BATFE rules. Comes with (2) 30rd mags, factory box and paperwork. Comes with collapsible stock but it is a bit wobbly for some reason. Don't bother looking for one on gunbroker, there isn't one there and hasn't been for quite sometime. These are very hard to come by. I don't have to sell, just seeing what is out there. Since ARs are now in the $2000-3000 range I'll take $3500,  If I don't get it I'll just put it away and let it appriciate some more. Thanks for looking and have a happy new year. 

I have a buyer tomorrow for full price, until the funds are in my hand however it is still for sale/trade."

I baught this gun about two weeks ago. Now I just found a Bushmaster carbine! So now I have to dump out this one to get the new gun.

Please be careful, there is a lot of scam crap going on right now where people are ""offering"" AR-15's for 1/2 price.

Some people are upset about the price of the gun, my response:
As for the price of my gun. Yes, I know it went way up in price even when I purchased the gun

from the gun shop. I basically accepted the higher price as ""insurance"" that I could posesses the gun as

a grandfathered in weapon. The new weapon I just purchased last week was also was very very expensive. Am I upset or feel like I got taken? Nope, it is the same principal, I am paying for the right to own the rifle here and now with the current market conditions so that it is a grandfathered in weapon. Now if someone else wants to buy my weapon before any legislation, I am going to charge my price, take it or leave it. I do not really care! It would be nice to sell my extra gun. If I can not sell my extra gun, not a big deal, I now have two AR-15 rifles in different styles. If the assult weapons ban does not go through, yes I paid a lot for my guns.

It comes with one magazine and the factory storage case.  Bought new this past year, never fired only used as carry weapon.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters."

Only a few hundred rounds ran thru it. You can also change the calibers of the pistol by ordering new kits can be changed to a 45.Cal 9mm or a 357. Gun also has night sights on it and comes with two clips and a new laser was just put on the gun sighted in for 30 yards. The only reason I'm wanting to trade this gun is because of the trigger it has a DA trigger meaning the trigger.pull is just like a revolver nothing can be done with the trigger. Will trade for another 40.Cal a 45.Cal 357. let me know what you have. Thanks

Certainly one of the most unusual-looking guns to come out is the Mossberg 500 Chainsaw. Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories

I am selling this fine rifle because I only bow hunt now and do not use it.  The rifle has a detachable 5 round box magazine, that is flush with the stock when inserted.   The bolt acts on a 70 degree turn to allow the use of a scope. Another feature of this gun I enjoy is that the safety is right on the tang/thumb rest for easy access for left and right handed shooters.  This would be a great hunting rifle or long range target rifle.  There are few calabers that you can easily get such a wide range of ammunition for.  The gun also come with a cabelas scope and a ruger stock pouch/ammo holder. I will also throw in a box of ammo.

Voyager® Series
 Our Voyagers® are, ounce for ounce, far stronger than 99.9% of our competitor's folders. And this is a fact, not an idle boast. Each knife features precision made parts with a stiff spring and our incomparable Tri-Ad® lock mechanism which is arguably the strongest, most reliable, low maintenance lock in the world!

The thick, extra wide blades are made from Japanese AUS 8A steel and meticulously ground to a thin edge for maximum shearing potential. This thin edge also allows us to hone each blade to astounding sharpness. And, because of the high carbon content of the steel, and their near perfect heat treatment, you'll find this sharpness last a surprisingly long time.

If you like serrations, you'll really appreciate our exclusive pattern. It features groups of very small, sharply pointed teeth separated by wide, shallow arcs so it will rip smoothly yet very aggressively through a wide variety of tough fibrous materials without snagging or hanging up.

The Voyager® Series also offers all the other latest refinements in lock-back construction including lightning quick, one-handed opening, state of the art mechanical fasteners, massively oversized pivot pins that are fully adjustable and properly hardened, and dual stainless steel pocket clips for ambidextrous carry and deployment.

The Grivory handles feature 6061 heat treated aluminum liners for the utmost in strength and stiffness and are ergonomically designed to afford a wide array of grip options including the palm reinforced forward grip for which they are particularly well suited.

Grivory is unparalleled as a handle material as it is considerably stronger than Zy-Ex and, when deeply textured, offers a terrific non-slip grip. As an added bonus, it's impervious to moisture and won't crack, warp or shrink and remains remarkably resistant to abrasion or discoloration.

As tools these lightweight, super sharp knives are appropriate in almost any environment from hunting and camping to hiking and general utility chores. They can also readily fill specialty functions such as a boat or river knife, chute knife or police/military and survival/rescue applications.

You know how much 30 round mags are going for- this comes with 10!, also comes with a tactical type sling and 4 power scope. (these items not in picture)

This Bushmaster has a lightweight barrel and is quite nice to carry. The barrel is about 11.5"" with about a 4.5"" compensator(compensator is permanently attached), it also has a Hogue grip. It does have scratches and some wear.  I think the muzzle brake works well to reduce recoil for such a lightweight rifle. 

The Tritium sights (sometimes called night sights, actually called low light sights) make this rifle nicer in darkness. 

You will probably have a difficult time finding one like this...

I AM NOT DESPERATE, It is not mandatory for me to build this other rifle, so please no ridiculous low ball offers. Thanks:) 

As an aside, in the long length of time I have been on this site, many mall ninjas and internet commandos like to comment that my weapons are worth less than my price (many times I hear this right before I sell which always gives me a chuckle). If you are one of these, I have only one thing to say- I can listen to anyone who can ARTICULATE with fact- However this rarely if ever happens. If you think my weapon is overpriced copy and paste a link to this same model of weapon with a cheaper price. If you cannot articulate what you say, you are wasting my time, go back to the minions of inarticulate ""change, change, change"",  ""yes we can"" crowd.

The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun manufactured in Turkey by Ucyildiz Arms*.  The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar.  The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed.
The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel.  The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard.  The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver.   The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer.  
The MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal chokes.  The magazine release button mimics the M16 rifle location.  The manual safety also duplicates the M16 style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip.  The top of the receiver has a carrying handle and  integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or any optical accessories.  The MKA 1919 12 gauge shotgun is appropriate for all levels of hunting and sporting enthusiasts.  It comes in Black and ""BONZ"" camo versions and is reasonably priced for our distributors and customers alike.

There was a very nice man who sold a bunch of window p mags to us for 12 bucks each, i personally purchased 10 of them and have them put up along with others that i have purchased in various colors over the past few years.  I see others on here selling these same mags on here for 45-60 each.  I understand the need to make a few extra bucks but really 3 or 4 times what you paid.  This person even said he could sell them for more but didn't want to feed into the hype.   It's sad that we as fellow gun owners would take advantage of one another like this in these uncertain times.  I encourage everyone who is looking for p mags due to the ""scare"" that is going on, check your local retailers, check online and take your time you will find them at a reasonalbe price.  3 to 4 times normal is not reasonalbe.  Carolina rod n gun had them last week for 24 each, Brownells is out of stock but are taking backorders only for the black w/out windows.   Do yourself a favor and dont feed into the hype and these prices will fall back down to normal levels.  That would hold true for parts, rifles, ammo and any other item that is on the endangered list."

The laser came mounted to the gun, but was removed and never used past the initial demonstration. It comes with everything, but the box has been opened and the battery has already been installed. Other than that, the laser is brand new.

It's a low profile, red laser with a soft ambidextrous button -- not a slide switch. As far as lasers go, it felt very solid on the gun (no wobbles) and has a sleek profile. The switches are solid and any combination of presses will turn the laser on or off. I never took it to the range, but online reviews say it holds true very well.

Here is Sig Sauer's webpage about the laser: http://www.sigsauer.com/SigStore/cpl-rm-classic-pistol-laser-405.aspx

This laser retails for $150 from Sig Sauer.  It can be had elsewhere online for $100.  Here's your chance to pick it up from me for $80.

I can meet you anywhere in the metro Nashville area.  I'm also open to shipping and can accept PayPal.

You can reach me by phone or text at REDACTED or e-mail me here. My name is Justin.

I TAKE NO POSITION ON PRICING OF ANYTHING. THIS POST IS JUST TO GET PEOPLE TO CONTACT THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO OPPOSE THE BAN AND TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THIS BAN INCLUDES.

The proposed Feinstein (D) CA ban requires NFA registration of all existing so called ""assault weapons"" including handguns, and shotguns. Additionally the characteristics that define an ""assault weapon"" are being reduced from two ""military"" characteristics to just one. All of the thumbhole and bayonette lug removed rifles that were ok under the last ban would be ""assault weapons"" under this one. The $200.00 NFA tax will apply and your local law enforcement will have to sign off. Fingerprinting and photographing is required. ""Assault weapons"" not already in private hands will be banned and the NRA, which has a copy of the bill text indicates that transfers of ALL ""grandfathered"" ""assault weapons"" including transfers to family members are prohibited. ""Grandfathered ""assault weapons"": WOULD HAVE TO BE REGISTERED IN THE NFA REGISTRY AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. Magazines over 10 rounds are banned without additional details. There are no provisions for school security (because this isn't about safety).The ban of course will do nothing to stop mass shootings or other crime. As soon as the next mass shooting occurs they will come back with a confiscation bill and go door to door. 

Don't take my word for what's included in this ban.  It's all on Feinstein's website:

Dear,

I am writing you regarding the numerous gun control schemes currently being proposed. I strongly oppose any additional gun control measures, including, but not limited to, those restricting magazines or so called ""assault weapons"". Guns are not the problem. If guns or access to guns were the problem, then Vermont, with some of the most lenient gun laws in the country, which doesn't even require a permit to carry concealed, would not consistently have some of the lowest homicide rates in the nation. Just 1.1 homicides / per 100,000 population in 2010, which was about 1/4 of the national average. So much for argument that availability of guns increases homicide rates. 

With regard to ""assault weapons"", which are really just semi-automatic rifles; these guns are rarely used in homicides. For example in 2011, according to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, rifles, including ""assault"" rifles were used in 2.55% of homicides. The UCR does not track how many of these specifically involved an ""assault"" rifle, however, it is obviously less than 2.55% for 2011 since that is the total for ALL rifles combined. By contrast personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.) were used as the murder weapon in 5.75% of homicides in 2011 and knives and cutting instruments were used in 13.38% of homicides. Other years are similar. 

The UCR 2007 - 2011 homicide by weapon tables are here: 

www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8 

There is simply too little criminal use of these so called ""assault"" weapons which are really just semi-automatic rifles used lawfully by millions of Americans, for regulation of them to make any difference in our crime rates even if criminals obeyed laws, and, they don't. Connecticut had a 'gun free' schools law and an 'assault weapons' ban. Neither had any effect on the school shooter there, other than perhaps to guarantee his success by insuring that he was the only one armed. Compare the Sandy Hook tragedy, where nobody but the killer was armed, to the 1997 Pearl Mississippi school shooting where Vice Principal Joel Myrick was able to retrieve his handgun from his truck (it was illegal for him to possess or carry it in the school) and apprehend the shooter, Luke Woodham without Myrick firing a single shot. Luke Woodham's admitted plan after attacking his high school, was to go to the local Jr. High and continue his rampage there. Myrick stopped that plan cold. Unfortunately, there was no ARMED Joel Myrick at Sandy Hook. In another incident, in 2001, senior Jason Hoffman opened fire at Granite Hills High School in El Cajon, California. Hoffman wounded five people before being shot and incapacitated by, ARMED school resource officer (a police officer) Richard Agundez.



We don't need more gun control, which has failed over and over every time it's been tried. We need real security, not useless 'feel good' measures that strip us of our constitutional rights for the mere illusion of safety. We need ARMED police officers in schools. These officers can provide security from all levels of threats as well as serve as badly needed role models for the children they protect. Giving the Joel Myricks of our country the ability to legally possess the guns they need to responsibly protect themselves and the children in their care wouldn't hurt either.

Sincerely,

THIS IS THE BADDEST SW Mp15/22 you are ever likely to see
1.	There is a custom color fill on the weapon RED and WHITE automotive grade paint it doesn’t chip or flake and its painted to match the very high end Mk416 (same one seals used to shoot binladen)
2.	From the back to the front there is a shoulder cushion (recoil doesn’t require it but its a lot smoother than the highly textured buttpad and it made the gf happy
3.	The grip is a magpul made for right handed shooters and it’s a bit beefier then the stock one, 
4.	The trigger as I already said has new LOW PULL springs in it effectly cutting the trigger pull from 8lbs to 3.5-4lbs never tested but its noticeable and on this light caliber that equals accuracy
5.	The optic is a VORTEX STRIKEFIRE RED/GREEN dot with a high-rise mount with pictinii add on rails, this is the high end version of this it even has a NV feature plus it comes with a doubler so if you need a little more magnification, there is also a (FLASH KILL) basically a honey comb over the front that isn’t removable to hide the glare of the lenses in the sun (makes it look cooler)
6.	The front of the gun, I have three flashhiders that will go with it, the factory Birdcage, a demon (50 bucks) with red fill and the “suppressor shroud” which hides the length of the barrel beyond that rail system. It isn’t a surpressor at all it just looks really freaking cool and that will deff go with it
7.	The light and foregrip I can separate but not really wanting too since I literally had to tape them together, the light is a 280 lumen tactical white light LED with strobe feature and its direct pressure activated only it doesn’t stay on and it switches between (on and strobe) its totally blinding and at night we tested it I couldn’t see the “shooter” plus it will help in close ranges for home defense and the bullets land predictably in the lighted zone (not a lazer but a quick few shots at close range you will be fine.


For the entire package $1000 or an sks plus 400



I have some wiggle room with this if your willing to actually prove you’re here to deal not just talk but I’ve had a lot of people string me along and I don’t have to sell this gun, I built it to be the baddest .22 and gun range gun both things I still consider it so let me know what you think and get back to me.

READ THIS OVER $1400 invested in everything DO NOT OFFER ME 500 please waste someone else time, I KNOW IT ISNT CHEAP FOR A .22 BUT there is alot invested and I dont have to sell it so DO NOT WASTE MY TIME IF THIS ADD IS UP I STILL HAVE IT
WILL TRADE FOR:

I also have the body armour pictured its Large IBA (interceptor body armour) Manufactured by point blank with the kevlar inserts intact (NO CERAMIC) but is in very good shape can add it on or if you just want the vest let me know what your thinking cash trade 100-150 old military stuff love seal gear as my buddy is one cool watches oakleys let me know what you have it is very real and never taken a round."

The Glock 19 is effectively a reduced-size Glock 17, called the ""Compact"" by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19 has a barrel and pistol grip that are shorter by approximately 12 mm (0.5 in) compared to the Glock 17 and uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, with available capacities of 10, 17, 19, and 33 rounds. To preserve the operational reliability of the short recoil system, the mass of the slide remains the same as in the Glock 17 from which it is derived. With the exception of the slide, frame, barrel, locking block, recoil spring, guide rod, and slide lock spring, all of the other components are interchangeable between the models 17 and 19."
