Windham weaponry is the former bushmaster company before Remington bought them out. They signed and agreement not to make weapons for 5 years. It is the original bushmaster staff after Remington fired them all. This is a better, tighter AR15 than the bushmaster and this is MILSPEC (which is a grey area anyway) except for the buffer, its commercial. Google the reviews of this weapon. No complaints. Also not available anywhere. This is a new, never fired, still in box gun. It comes with a hard case and 30 round mag. Lifetime transferable warranty 
If its still listed its still for sale.

I have kept this gun pretty meticulously clean--yes, even the gas system.  Perfect turkey hunting gun (though if you put slugs in it I'm fairly certain that there is no beast on the North American continent that you couldn't bring down).  

This gun's true colors show however when used for relieving stress.  My friend, there is nothing more awesome than blasting off five 10ga rounds in rapid fire from the hip...and nothing else will do as much damage to a bowling pin, or your favorite rotting produce.   Or, I guess if you're a real @-hole, you could use it for combat/defense applications...the recoil is actually QUITE manageable thanks to the big beefy gas-operation system this howitzer employs, which is what makes rapid-firing it so fun.  The first time I triple-tapped this thing I had a sh*t-eating grin on my face for about half an hour.  This is a completely different story than a 12gauge my friend...the sheer power that this thing wields will give you a warm fuzzy feeling in all the right places, heheh.

I am sad to see this gun go, as it was so much fun and so easy to handle despite it's enormity, but I need to prune the ole arsenal.  This gun cost over $1,000 new if I recall, so at $600 it's a real bargain.  Matte finish is beginning to show wear in spots, but it is minor."

With gun stores incredibly short on inventory right now, this could be your opportunity to get an amazing NIB handgun by year’s end if you act quickly.  

For those of you not familiar with the Springfield XD 9, I suggest you check out Paul Scarlata’s Guns & Ammo Handgun Magazine article at this web link:  

http://www.handgunsmag.com/2010/09/24/featured_handguns_polysh_032707/

Scarlata compares the Springfield XD 9 very favorably with the popular iconic police shooters S&W M&P 9, Glock 17 and H&K P2000, but the XD is value priced much lower. So here is an opportunity to get a brand new highly reliable, accurate shooter at a very reasonable price.

152,http://www.armslist.com/posts/744152,For Sale:  CUOMO'S GUN CONFISCATION PROPOSAL,"NEW YORK, New York, United States","$ 123,456,789","Listed On: Sunday, December 23, 2012",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a posting to inform you about Governor Cuomo's recent proposals made regarding ""assault"" weapons.

Cuomo has stated that outright CONFISCATION of these weapons may be an option, FORCED buy-backs may be an option, or FORCED registration/permits may be an option.

*Remember registration always leads to confiscation (history proves this to a degree).

Do NOT let this happen & please do NOT comply if the above occurs. Spread the word and convince anyone you know with an ""assault"" weapon not to comply if this comes to fruition. They can't physically arrest and make felons of 10's-of-thousands or 100's-of-thousands of New Yorkers.

If you're a LEO, National Guard soldier/reservist, or in the Military PLEASE back your community's people in the event that this occurs. Do not comply with these outrageous propositions if they become a reality.

It's absolutely unethical that these politicians with suits & a pen think they can deny another human being the right to adequately defend themselves in their own home. A human being defending themselves has every right in doing so, to possess a firearm capable of accepting magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.

Beyond an individuals right to defend life (with more than 10 rounds), it's also absolutely unethical for the state to forcibly confiscate the equity that an individual possesses in these assets.

Thank you for your time in reading this practice of free speech.

This is a LNIB rifle, which only had 29 rounds down range. 20 rounds was for breaking-in procedure. And the next 3 rounds was 1/2 MOA at 200 yards. ( 1/4 MOA at 100 yards ).  Here, you can see i shot 3 targets, 3 shots/each and the groups can be cover by  ...pennies..The condition is 99.99% like new condition, if i don't tell you it's used, there are no way you can't tell it's new or used
The barrel was completely broke in after 20 shots, based on standard procedures of military and experts .When the barrel was new, fire the first shot, clean the barrel with proper tools ( bronze brush, solvent, cleaning rod, and barrel oil ). Then fire the second shot, clean again. Repeat that procedure until you reached the 20th. Then your barrel completely broke in, given ultimate accuracy, increased the barrel life and improved the performance. The rifle stock made by H-S Precision, it was then glass bedded by a professional gunsmith, given the barrel completely free-float, increased the accuracy more far away than a factory accuracy expectation.

The rifle is equipped with:
1/ Woodland camouplage H-S Precision Tactical stock for heavy, contour barrel
2/Timney trigger ( tactical model ), fully adjustable from 1.5-4 lbs trigger pull ( the rifle's trigger was set at 2.5 lbs. )
3/ Ultralight Harris bipod ( 6-9"" )
4/ Redfield Tracker scope ( 3-9x40 ) with Butler Creek flip-up lens cover - This is not a Redfield new production scope, this is a oldest model, which made more than 20 years ago. But the condition is fantastic, no scratches anywhere on the body, or the lens. Remember, the sniper rifle M700 scope, which used in Vietnam War by Marines was made by Redfield. Same quality and performance.
5/ Quick-release 1"" tactical scope rings. Made from solid steel by Burris. Not the cheap-ass aluminum rings you buy in Walmart.
6/ Mossy Oak buttstock shell holder 
7/ Mossy Oak camouplage wraparound scope net cover

I will also give away a box of 20 rounds match ammo, made by Hornady.

All mags are in good working condition. Some have finish wear and scratches as seen in pictures, mags discounted will have more than average wear. They do NOT have any dents or dings and are in overall good used condition.

Shipping will be $6 for ANY quantity of mags, order 1 or 100 it will only cost you $9 for shipping.

I accept PayPal only! Either PayPal gift (so I dont get hit with the fees), or PayPal + 4% of your total.
The reason I no longer accept checks or money orders is because in the past I have waited weeks after boxing up items, and then never ended up receiving payment. So to keep my prices low and to avoid wasting my time and yours I now only accept PayPal. Some people ruin it for everyone...you know who you are.

Prices are firm unless you buy a large quantity. I have no problem selling these for my asking prices in the past.

I as the seller am not able to know all laws in all areas, so it is YOUR responsibility as the buyer to know if these are legal for you to own; in your state, city, county, area, etc.

First come first serve, I only have a limited number of these (especially the dated mags) and last time I posted these I sold out within hours. Get them while you can!!!

I am answering emails and questions as they come in. I am VERY behind on answers, so please bear with me through this rush.

With gun stores incredibly short on inventory right now, this could be your opportunity to get an amazing NIB handgun by year’s end if you act quickly.  

For those of you not familiar with the Springfield XD 9, I suggest you check out Paul Scarlata’s Guns & Ammo Handgun Magazine article at this web link:  

http://www.handgunsmag.com/2010/09/24/featured_handguns_polysh_032707/

Scarlata compares the Springfield XD 9 very favorably with the popular iconic police shooters S&W M&P 9, Glock 17 and H&K P2000, but the XD is value priced much lower. So here is an opportunity to get a brand new highly reliable, accurate shooter at a very reasonable price.

These Rifles are due in less than 2 weeks:  
Pre –Order Only.  Guaranteed to get one.

This is hands down THE BEST AK47 AK-47 on the market.
Top Quality – AMERICAN BUILT – ALL NEW PARTS

M&M has the M10-762  manufactured out of brand-new high quality parts - everything is newly manufactured to be US Section 922(r) compliant, though the receiver is made in Romania.. 

The AK receivers made in Romania and is Brand New – not made of used parts.
 The M10-762 has a brand-new, chrome-lined 16.25"" barrel, with a 1:10 twist rate, with four lands and grooves, with a right-hand twist.

The overall length of this gun is 26"" with the fixed stock, and they are coming out with folding stock versions, if you want a more compact carry gun. 

The rifle weighs-in at 7.3 pounds, but their web site says the gun weighs 6-lbs. 

The M10-762 takes all standard AK-47 magazines, and the rifle is supplied with one magazine. It has a TAPCO RAZR muzzle brake/flash suppressor on the end of the barrel. The RAZR can also be used as a ""compliance"" device because of the super-sharp cut to the brake. 

The pistol grip is outstanding. This rubber covered pistol grip is not only larger than the standard AK pistol grip, but it is perfectly configured to fit the hand if you ask me. If there is a better pistol grip out there for an AK, then I haven't found it. 

The stock is USA-made (by TAPCO) and is black synthetic of some sort. 

The fore end on the M10-762 is an aluminum quad-rail type, firmly attached, so you can mount lasers, lights and red dot optics on it if you choose - and this is a really nice quad-rail, to be sure. 

My only complaint is that the rail covers that came with the quad-rail are thick and make the foreend feel too thick. A quick call to Brownell's solves my problem with a set of ""ladder"" rails - these cover and protect the rails but don't add any girth. These are a ""must have"", in my humble opinion. 

The front sight is mounted on the gas block, instead of on the end of the barrel. This gives you a slightly shorter sighting radius, but I didn't find it to be any sort of a handicap in my shooting. 

The rear sight is an RPK graduated fully adjustable for windage and elevation sight that adjusts all the way up to 1,000 meters..

A TAPCO single-hook trigger is installed in the M10-762, and I think this is the best after-market AK trigger you can have in an AK. The let-off was right at 4 pounds on my sample and it was very smooth, too. 

A TAPCO AK retaining plate is used to keep the trigger pin and safety pin in place - a much better set-up than the simple bent spring that comes with most AKs these days. 

The lower receiver is stamped and heat-treated to military specs. No cleaning rod was included.

There is also a quick-detachable scope mount base on the left side of the receiver if you want to mount a scope. 

I'm not an FFL ---  IF it has to be shipped by one its your job to know this and tell me along with any other stipulations.  

Make sure it is legal to own this before you bid.   I will not refund money for any reason. The price will only go up from here.  Item not for sale where prohibited. Check local laws before purchasing as purchaser is responsible for following all state laws. No CA, NY, HI, CT, MA, NJ, Cook Co. IL, Wash D.C Sales. I will ship UPS ground to the lower 48.

Payment Options:  Money Order, Cashiers Check. Visa, Mastercard, Discover and American Express. Credit cards purchases please add 4%.

We ordered these rifles 6 months ago and are just now being shipped to us.  WE ARE GETTING THEM.

This is for Pre-Order - You will be Guaranteed to receive one if purchased.  Payment in full is required to ensure you receive the rifle.

The Stock was purchased for $90 and installed on my 500 along with the railed forend ($25) for use in 3Gun Matches. I found that this gun is just too slow and sold it for a Benelli Auto. The guy I sold the gun to wanted just the pistol grip on the shotgun along with a pistol grip forend so I pulled them off and sold it. They are in like new condition. Seriously... if I still had the box I could literally list it was new and no one would know. This stock is kind of cool. You can unscrew just one bolt and take the tube and butt stock off and you have a pistol gripped shotgun (kind of weird that the guy didn't want that but I guess he wanted a discount on the shotgun). I also purchased a Blackhawk sling adapter that I will leave on if you like for no extra charge. If you do not want it I will gladly take it off and keep it. The ProMag forend is in like new condition too and is already perfectly pre-drilled for a forend strap. I had this done for the strap I had on it but since the strap is a bit obscene, I decided to take it off before I took pictures. Together the forend, sling adapter and stock sold new for over $120. Since I have no use for it I am willing to sell them both for $75 or individually at $60 for the Stock and $15 for the forend. I am not trying to make a big profit with this stuff and it is priced right (Check online) so please don't send me lowball emails asking for the stuff cheaper. If you are interested please let me know and thanks for looking."

It is driven by the Law of supply and demand. Free market capitalism and money for that matter has no inherent morals.

Example: If a BAD person is using MONEY for BAD purposes, the action of that individual is BAD (And Vice-versa). If you are comfortable Gouging someone (who happens to be your ""Brother-in-arms""), then I see you as Evil and WILL take my business elsewhere. Just remember, when they do instate this ""alleged"" Assault Weapons Ban, we will still have a high supply of your junk and a low demand for it (TRUE FREE MARKET CAPITALISM) which means one day you will be begging me to buy your $5 AR mags.

I put two mags through one of them. One for accuracy and one rapid fire. I had a very sweet, accurate pattern as well as a flawless performance. I have a new respect for these weapons.  Not everyone has the extra 500 to 600 for a Glock. If you are looking for a new affordable home defense hand gun with three 9 round mags, a nice tactical holster, ghost ring sight and tools, and a box of 230 gr ammo, this will work quite well. I just sold the used one and have the one pictured left.  I am not hurting for money and will keep firm at $325.00 for now. Nice package and pistol for affordable defense. Thank you."

This AR is ridiculously powerful...it makes shooting anything else (outside of a .50 BMG) feel like a cap gun...it's not for everyone...but if you must have the biggest, baddest AR...and don't want to spend $10,000 for a Barrett .50 BMG...then this AR will definitlely make you smile ear to ear after firing it. Kind of like Ivan Drago in Rocky III...whatever it hits, it destroys!!! You do not want to be on the receiving end of this gun....INSANE is all I can say about it.

The .50 cal Beowulf round is the most destructive short range round out there...originally designed for the military to disable vehicles by ripping through entire engine blocks of oncoming assault vehicles. See youtube video:
