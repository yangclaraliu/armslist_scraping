Obviously it's in excellent condition. Drilled and tapped for a scope. Some wear from working the action to oil it every year or so. 

It's the perfect rifle to teach a youngster about the joys of marksmanship. Also, with ammo prices where they are today you can't beat the cost-per-round of .22 LR.

I am looking for offers on the rifle. I will keep the scope on it for the right price, remember the scope alone was just over $200 and holds a lifetime warranty. It is a very nice shooter and quite accurate for what it is. I took a deer at 300 yards last year and the scope is still dead on at 100 yards. I still have the reciepts from the gunsmith who did the work to it aswell. The scope in the picture is not the same scope that is on the rifle now."

The stock has a spot where the two 10rd mags or one 30rd mag can be stored.

This is a lightweight, easy to carry and maintain rifle that groups very well and has been taken very good care of. It has been kept clean and oiled and it was cleaned/oiled everytime at the range right after shooting. I dont want to and dont have to sell it but I need some cash and I want to get a tactical 12 gauge. Thats is the only reason I'm selling it. There is nothing wrong with the rifle whatsoever!

This rifle started out as a standard stainless carbine model, bought brand new about 3 months ago. Since then it has been modified with the following:

Green Mountain 20"" Stainless Target Barrel
Boyd's SS Evolution Stock - Sky Blue
KIDD ""Trigger Job"" Kit - 1-3/4lbs
KIDD Auto Bolt Release
KIDD Extended Magazine Release - Interchangeable
KIDD Bolt Buffer

Just in parts alone there is just over $450 invested into this gun, not including the original purchase price of $289 as it was the stainless model with the black composite stock.

The gun has about 500-700 rounds through it, and the barrel was broken well with intermittent cleaning every 50-100 rounds. Great gun, and shooting it is a blast.

Why not surprise them with this drum set?

I have a great Pacific brand drum set in dark green, with an upgraded ash wood snare drum in a matching dark green stain. 
DW 5000 series double bass pedal and matching hi-hat stand with DW drop clutch. 
14"" Zildjian ZBT hi-hats, 16"" Sabian B8 medium crash on boom stand, 14"" Sabian B8Pro medium-thin crash on boom stand, and a Zildjian ZBT 20"" medium ride on a straight stand. (image does not reflect current stand configuration - pic shows a crash on a straight stand, but its now on a boom).
Also comes with throne, and can include a stick bag with sticks, as well as an old bell set for a student starting percussion in band. 
(note, this is not a student drum set - it's a very high quality set, worthy of a recording studio or concert stage - but a beginner learning on this would certainly appreciate the high quality sound). 
This set with cymbals, hardware, pedals, and incredible upgraded snare cost around $2,000+. 
I grew up playing, but after 6 years in the Army when I pieced together this set and tried to get back into playing my feet and hands just didn't work the way I wanted. 
So... I want to build my arsenal.
I'd be willing to entertain any trade offers worth around the same as this set.  
I'd like to get a good AR setup, or any tactically sporterized high-capacity magazine-fed marksmen rifles. I'm a fan of foregrips and bipods, lights and lasers, etc on my tactical stuff. Anything like this already on the rifle helps match value. 
Also a fan of pistols. I like them high quality - Sigs, Glocks, S&W M&P, Kimber, H&K, etc...  
I would also like a very good compound bow setup with all the upgrades, case, harness, bells and whistles, etc... and arrows. As many as I can finagle, as this isn't a cheap drum setup. To sweeten the deal, you could throw in a decent bow for my little lady as well. And some targets just because you're still getting the better deal. 
Also interested in traditional bows, particularly high quality takedown recurves.
ALso interested in an Olympic style competition recurve bow with counterweight balancers, sights, arrows, etc. In such a case I'd only want one that's at least 72"" with a 30.5""-31"" draw.
shoot me an email and let me know what you've got. Thanks.

Hello, I have a 1911 Remington Rand for sale and it is in great condition. a similar 1911 like mine is on gunsofamerica.com in way worse shape for 1500 not including shipping. This is a awesome opportunity to own a great RR for a great price. This gun was manufactured in 1943 and after having a ww2 collector break it down and look at it he found that the only non original parts on the gun are the grips which, you can get on ebay for 45.00. Gun has a High Standard barrel, R stamped magazine, FJA and P inspector marks that are clearly visible and readable. If you are looking for a 1911 from WW2 this is it! The gun shoots well and I cleaned it right after shooting every time.

TRADES:  I will trade for M14s, AR15s, Nice AK47s, and really anything similar to these kind of guns. I am also interested in modern handguns like HK, FN, Colt, Smith and Wesson, To make it simple just let me know what you got. I will need a trade value of 1,500 and I can add cash myself if its something I really need, If your trade does not come to 1,500 we can do partial cash.

CONTACT: You can call/text me at REDACTED or email me at REDACTED 

SHIPPING: I can ship the gun, buyer pays shipping and transfer fees and we can discuss payment."

They have been saying the value of these early ps90's will just keep going up as in the last few years have tripled. Any questions please feel free to email me. Thanks for looking."
619,http://www.armslist.com/posts/603619,For Sale:  Colt 1877 Lightning 38 Caliber SA/DA,"Mishawaka, South Bend, Indiana","$ 1,000","Listed On: Wednesday, October 10, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The M1877 was designed by one of the inventors of the Colt Single Action Army, William Mason as Colt's first attempt at manufacturing a double-action revolver. The M1877 was the first successful US made double-action cartridge revolver.[2]
The M1877 was offered from the factory in two basic finishes: nickel plated or a case-hardened frame with a blue barrel and cylinder. 

I am offering a beautiful example of a case hardened blue barrel M1877.  It has all of the numbers matching and is in good functioning condition.  It holds half and full cock securely.  It advances and fires in the double action as it should.  

According to the serial numbers, this 1877 was manufactured in 1893 so it can be shipped directly to you.  No need for either a Curio or FFL License since this firearm predates the 1898 cut off to qualify as an antique.   

I have seen these guns selling for close to $1800 on Gun Broker and other sites.  I am a motivated seller."

I would like to sell or trade for a .22LR pistol AND a 9mm pistol. I will use the money to buy a NEW Buckmark Whisper with threaded barrell and a NEW Hi-Point C-9.

The Sig P250 2SUM is a package made up of a full-sized and a subcompact .40 Sig P250 pistol. Its modular design allows you to move the trigger assembly between the two frames.

The P250, with its serialized modular frame and fire control assembly, allows the user to change caliber, grip, trigger, and slide length at will. Changing out your 2SUM .40 to any of the other calibers offered by SIG SAUER, is as easy as purchasing a P250 Caliber X-Change Kit. The 2SUM includes the P250 full-size with polymer grip, nitron- finished stainless slide with SIGLITE® night sights, an integrated accessory rail in double-action only and one full size magazine. The 2SUM also includes a P250 Subcompact snag-free polymer grip, nitron- finished stainless slide with SIGLITE night sights, barrel and one subcompact magazine"

Very nice starter pistol. Fantastic Concealed carry protection for Women or Elderly!

You do not need strong hands to ""charge"" or ratchet the slide to chamber a round. Beretta was thinking when they made this great little protector.

Flip up the Barrel, install a round, insert the magazine, you're ready to go.
Nice safety, in a 1911 style switch. Need to disarm the weapon? Flip up the barrel! Impossible to fire with barrel in up position or safety on.

Soviet crest, 1942 date, serial number, and 1891/59 stamped into the receiver.  Very nice stock and metal on this rifle. Comes with web sling.

These are very rare carbines that were made by shortening Model 91 long rifles after WW2 for police forces.  Not very many of these rifles were made. Auction sites are seeing $300 for these rifles currently.

Unlike the M44 carbine, the M91/59 carbine DOES NOT have the permanently mounted bayonet on the side, and the rifling in the bore of 91/59 extends all the way to the end of the barrel, unlike the M44 that has a counter bore going down a half inch or so.

The bore is very shootable, but not perfect (these were made from WW2 surplus M91's so they can be expected to show some wear).  I've shot about 40 through this rifle and it is very accurate and a fun little shooter.

I'm selling due to some issues regarding bills coming up on the holidays.  I have more pictures I can send you if you are interested.  If you'd like the upper without the sights, I can lower the price.

The first personal protection system short of lethal force that could truly stop aggressive focused combatants.

Field proven with 10+ years of use by global law enforcement, the M26c is a full form personal protection device delivering 5 seconds of effect, putting control of the situation back in your hands. The size and design is preferred by those desiring a feel closer to a small firearm, but the effect is TASER's patented incapacitating pulse.

TASER personal protection devices use replaceable cartridges containing inert, compressed nitrogen to fire two small probes that are attached to 15 foot (4.5 meter) insulated conductive wires. Energy is sent over the wires into the probes, which can penetrate up to approximately two cumulative inches of clothing. The charge is transmitted between the two probes and is designed to jam the sensory and motor functions to inhibit muscular control. This NMI effect continues in 5 second cycles each time you press the trigger. The M26C personal protection device can also be used in direct contact stun mode.

EffectiveTASER ECDs are the only personal protection products that allow you to take control of your personal safety by consistently incapacitating aggressive, dangerous people.

SafeSafer and more effective than other personal protection options, such as sprays or direct contact stuns, which require potentially dangerous chemicals or close range to an attacker and often prove to be ineffective on individuals under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.

Keeps You Safe at a DistanceUnlike other personal protection devices which require you to be close to the target, TASER ECDs are effective at a range of up to 15 feet, which keeps you out of harm's way.

Easy To UseThe ADVANCED TASER M26C has been designed to withstand rugged use and features a quick action safety and trigger mechanism for easy use.

Full Sized DesignBased on the same design used by law enforcement worldwide, the M26c is a full sized ECD with a handle similar to a firearm, providing similar handling and use.

This one is somewhat of a novelty gun among SKS collectors. It has all the accessories on it from a company called CAPCO that was only in business from '89-'94 and, IIRC, only made SKS accessories. I have the original receipt and all the installation sheets of each item. It also comes with a detachable 5rnd mag that functions flawlessly. I have also modified the bolt so that you can insert/remove the mag with the bolt closed. It also comes with a newer Leaper's/UTG 3-9x40 mil-dot scope w/finger dial windage and elevation knobs and I installed a picatinney rail into the bayonet slot in order to mount a UTG Tactical/SWAT length bi-pod. This is a very nice shooting rifle with a crisp clean trigger pull. Price is firm, will ship to an 01 FFL at buyer's expense.

The Personal Protection In the Home course teaches defensive / tactical shooting skills which cannot be taught on a typical ""box"" range. 

This intermediate level course enables experienced shooters to move to cover, shoot from behind barricades, develop and employ advanced Flash-Sight-Picture skills, and much more. 

We cover mindset, legal issues, decision-making under pressure, and planning for the worst.
This course is designed around the use of the defensive pistol where standard marksmanship skills will not work, and will better enable you to survive a felonious attack.

Topical areas include:

1. Defensive Shooting / Rapid Engagement

2. Defensive Handgun Skills

3. Firearms and the Law: Possession, Ownership, and the Use of Deadly Force

4. Strategies for Preventing a Home Invasion 

5. Responding to a Violent Confrontation

6. Selecting a Handgun for Personal Defense

7. Three hours of Range Shooting

8. Course Review and Examination

Students will receive the NRA Guide to the Basics of Personal Protection in the Home handbook (a $20 value included in the price) and intensive lessons on basics of defensive shooting, issues of self-defense, and other strategies for protecting the home and family.

Students will receive feedback on their shooting exercises, and a National Rifle Association (NRA) certificate upon successful completion of this course. Not only are shooting standards fired during the practical exercises, but a written exam will be given at the end of the course. 

Our next PPITH Course is scheduled for THIS SATURDAY, October 20th, 2012. Don't wait; sign up now; seats are limited.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame the USP Compact uses a narrow full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
