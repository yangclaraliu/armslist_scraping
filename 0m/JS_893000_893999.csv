Prior to recent events, these sold in the $600-$700 range depending on different configurations.  I am looking for the all black furniture configuration. 
Also considered are: M70 or WASR 10/63's 
I would even consider the WalMart M400 or a Century Arms TanTAL in 5.45X39 
The package you offer would be most appreciated if it included 2 magazines and front sight tool. A cleaning kit isn't a problem. 

Regarding price, my thoughts are that there are some folks out there selling what were their entry level rifles from yeas ago.  They have since moved on to more accurate and better systems.  Given today's market, who wouldn't want to sell a rifle they bought a several years ago for a few hundred bucks at the prices being commanded in today's marketplace? I don't see anything wrong with that. Turns out that was an amazing investment!
 If you, or someone you know, would be willing to sell their AK at a 'reasonable' price,... I'm a cash buyer, 2 rifles, if the prices are right. I can present a DL, fill out a bill of sale, etc.  
Drop me an email with an offer and perhaps we can do business.  Thank you for taking the time to read my post. (Pictures are for reference only)

I'm looking for everything from old stocks to bolts to barrels to broken guns, fire burned firearms, parts guns, old stuff, sights... The list goes on and on. 

I don't have a lot to trade, but what I do is open. Trade by the piece or by the pound 

Trades I have are:
1oz Silver
Eisenhower $1 coins 
Susan B Anthony $1 coins 
some special Wheat Back pennies that we have doubles of
A nice, nearly new fly fishing rod
A nice Ibanez Acoustic-electric Bass guitar with on board tuner and EQ
A nice used Buck assisted open pocket knife
A cool little polymer Dragunov style Ruger 10/22 stock
I might have a Butler Creek 25rd 10/22 mag
I have lots of retro muscle and high performance Chevy stuff (motors, tranny, headers, valve covers, carbs etc...)
I have many hand made Yarn Balls for steelhead
I also have a little cash which I could supliment with manual labor, gun cleaning etc...

I can also do things like teach various programs such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excell (To build spread sheets) etc... I could even teach you to make a slide show log of your firearms, with photos showing overall condition, list of pertenant information like age, date, caliber, make, model, serial # and any other identifying marks to be saved on a flash drive, external hard drive or CD in case of burglary, theft or fire for insurance purposes.

I could also teach beginner as well as novice/intermediate guitar. I have taught many of my Youth Group students when I was a Youth Pastor for 4 years down in Oregon.

All in all I'm just wanting to collect some projects to work on as I proceed though this course as well as the next 2 quarters of my certification courses.

Thanks guys!!"

Product Overview

These .308 Lower receivers are made to fit both the DPMS and SR-25 magazines. The receivers carry some of the highest quality features out there on the market including a tear drop trigger guard machined into the lower, reinforced pivot pin and a generous magazine well to aid in loading. Like all of our products we hold them to the tightest tolerances and stand by them for life. The operations left to be completed are as follows/ fire control group, trigger pin, hammer pin, trigger slot and safety selector. This is a not an FFL item. This is not a complete receiver and still requires machining to be done."

As you can tell, I spent extra in all the right places.  But even things like the 4 position tube is from a military contract manufacturer and the interior is super smooth. The BCG has a resemblance to a Young's Match bolt carrier profile (good chance it is) with the anti-friction NiB coating.  The AXTS lower locks the bolt back when depressing the mag release while charging. But since completing it, I've decided to move up to 30 cal for that job.  So here it is up for sale.

It does come with Kahr's 1 year warranty (new ones come with a 5 year). From the looks of this it looks just like a new one. My price is firm so please no low offers.

In regards to this refurbish...it was a dealer sample. I'm told there are several reasons for refurbishing...

1. During production, pistols are randomly pulled off the assembly line for quality control purposes, test fired more than just the requisite one shell for Massachusetts (maybe 200rds), examined for defects, then sold as refurbished after passing muster.

2. Police trade-ins, like the Sig Sauer ""Factory Certified Pre-Owned"" pistols. The pistols are examined by gunsmiths at the factory, springs replaced, function tested, etc and sold as refurbished.

3. A dealer representative's sample pistol being returned, which then goes through the same procedure as for police trade-ins.

The big difference between a refurb and a used gun, however, is that the refurb has been inspected and restored to factory specs by a factory gunsmith, who understands the pistol better than anyone."

The operations left to be completed are as follows/ fire control group, trigger pin, hammer pin, trigger slot and safety selector. This is a not an FFL item.

It is new with only 3 shots fired to break in the barrel (barrel was cleaned after each shot.)  This was my baby, being purpose built to be a super-accurate AR.  Selling to fund part of the purchase of PVS-14 night vision.

Even before talk of the assault weapons ban, these RRA rifles were backordered over a year, I can't even imagine what they are like now.

Specs:
RRA Predator Pursuit upper with 20"" Stainless Steel Heavy Match Barrel by Wilson Barrels.   Mid-length gas system.  Free floated handguard.  Air Gauged, Cryogenically Treated, 1:8"" Twist, .223 Wylde chamber, Guaranteed by RRA to be less than 0.75MOA at 100 yards from the factory!  For those that aren't aware: firing .223 out of a 5.56 chamber is possible, and it is safe, however you will lose accuracy.  Firing 5.56 out of a .223 chamber is potentially dangerous due to the higher pressures.  .223 wylde is the best of both worlds.  It is capable of shooting 5.56 safely, however it is designed to shoot .223 much more accurately than 5.56.

Crome Bolt Carrier Group.  Again, there has been a shortage of BCGs for months, chrome was even harder to find.  Nothing less than the best for this rifle.

BCM Large charging handle, designed to help charge the rifle when a scope is mounted.

Rock River Arms lower receiver with a Rock River National Match Two-Stage trigger group.  Fantastic trigger.  Unlike most other match triggers, the rock river is considered 'battle ready', and not just a range trigger.

Magpul PRS stock.  This stock is fantastic, with an adjustable cheek weld and LOP.

I will include a scope as well, as I no longer have a use for it.  I was never able to save up for the scope I wanted, which is why the rifle is unfired (beyond 3 shots to break in the barrel).  Don't expect a $1200 trijicon.  This is a lit up Primary Arms 4-16x scope.  It is waterproof and nitrogen purged.  Did I mention that it lights up?  I will include the scope mount as well.

It is the TOP rifle in the picture, not the one on the bottom."

The style is ""Galco Miami Classic II"" seen at the below link for $189.95 new from Galco. This holster has been worn only a few times, and mostly hung up on a thick wooden coat-hangar. Includes weapon holster and magazine holster (fits 2 mags). Asking $125 because it's been barely worn at all in great condition, and I can save someone $65 for a holster in the same condition as new. 

Selling because I no longer own the G22 for it. Great for for winter wear or someone who wears a sport jacket/blazer/suit often, and wants easy access to their weapon with 2 spare mags; also good for carrying while seated more often than standing, providing easier access and comfort than an IWB holster at the rear positions.

Galco gives the same model number (MCII224B) to fit all sizes of Glock handguns (Full, Compact, Subcompact). ""Fits chests up to 52[inches]""

It's a great running rifle runs smooth. the only problem I've EVER had with it was when I first shot it, the muzzle brake came loose. I put red loc-tite on the threads and tightened the muzzle brake by hand. Hasn't moved since. I've had zero feed issues with the gun. The ADJ. gas pressure regulator is even on the lowest setting as well. 

The monkeys over at Century Arms must've been sober when they put this rifle together, LOL...

again the rifle shoots and looks great!!! I have two magazines for it. One is a new 20rnd magazine, and the other is a surplus magazine that will only takes 19rnds(idk why??). Usually the surplus mag will not trip the bolt hold open. the new mag does every time though. This is an issue with the magazine and not the rifle.

only blemishes are from where the brass comes back and contacts the side of the receiver.

VALID AZ DL & 21 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER ONLY!!! CCW PERMIT A PLUS!
if the add is still up, so is the rifle.

I will consider either partial or full trades. I like modern firearms, but I'm a sucker for classic military firearms or unique firearms. I already have an AR-15 and I'm not looking for another one. I don't like glocks either.

Thanks."

This is not a WASR and you can feel the difference. It's a very sturdy rifle. No mag wobble. Less than 300 rounds shot through it. Included four double stack steel magazines. This accepts all standard AK47 double-stack magazines. The SAR series is well known through the gun community as being one of the only AK-47 rifles imported into the United States on an original military specification receiver. They are known for excellent quality and extreme reliability (unlike the current Romanian WASR rifles) Almost all other AK 47 rifles in the country were either built here using other countries parts or imported as low capacity rifles and then drilled out for full magazines here in the States. Not so with the SAR rifles, they were built as they are in the country that makes them for their military.

XM855 ammo features a 62 grain, copper jacketed, lead core, steel tip bullet. It is not armor piercing ammunition, but the steel tip does allow it to penetrate farther than other types of ammo. This bullet will attract a magnet because of the steel in the tip, and some ranges will not allow you to use it because of this. However, it will not damage the barrel of your rifle, because the steel is entirely covered by a layer of copper.

The ammunition itself is extremely high quality, and has features not seen on other ammunition of this type. This ammo has a crimped primer, reducing the chances of a blown primer stopping a semi-automatic, or automatic rifle from functioning. It also has a lacquer primer sealant and a case mouth sealant, to prevent the internal components from being compromised by moisture intrusion.

Federal offers a weather resistant ammo can containing 420 rounds of this ammunition. Composed of 14 30-round boxes containing three stripper clips of 10 rounds each, this product is ideal for those looking to store ammo long term, but who also want to be able to access and load it quickly

When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups. All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions.
