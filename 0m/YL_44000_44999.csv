Here is a 20ga 1100LW 3INCH MAGNUM. You will not see many 1100 magnums in 20ga. Blueing is at atleast 95% wood is a lighter color with the normal little nicks and digs you will have with a gun that has been in the field. The only downside to this gun is the barrel has been cut down to 22 1/2 inches with a thin wall choke system installed and I only have one choke .It is marked IC ,, It patterns great with buckshot and #4 nitro mags. You can get more chokes from any of the bigger choke companies like Brileys or Tru-Choke but a REMCHOKE WILL NOT FIT. I bought this gun years back when I was going to Iowa pheasant hunting several times a year and this gun patterned so well I just never bothered to get more chokes.This is a great bird/field gun. It is set up for a sling so you can sholder it on all those long walks in the fields and recoil is light enough for a good deer gun for a kid. $350 Clinton ar."

From the Walther site:
The WaltherÂ® PP is blowback-operated pistol with a fixed barrel, usually of all-steel construction. The trigger is double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted manual safety/decocker. The lockwork is somewhat complicated; it has many small parts and pins. Sights are fixed, with the rear sight blade dovetailed into the slide. Magazines are single-stack. The magazine release button is located at the left side of the frame, just below the slide and in front of the grip panel. WaltherÂ® PPK pistols are fitted with a loaded chamber indicator, made in the form of a small pin that protrudes from the rear of the slide (above the hammer) when a cartridge is in the chamber. The WaltherÂ® PPK pistol is made in 7.65mm (.32ACP) caliber and 9mm Kurz (9x17, .380ACP)."

I had one just like it that was stolen under my brothers watch.  Hence, him giving me this one as a gift to replace it.  So i have 3 100 round boxes of S&W ammo with an additional 100 rd box with ~60 in it.  That's 360 rounds of quality ammo if your interested in that as well. Im not a dealer or FFL holder so no tax or fees will be applied to the price.  In-person cash transaction only.  Saint Augustine FL and surrounding areas.  Thanks for looking and God Bless.

This SR-25 has not been fired since leaving the factory! The bolt is still sealed in factory plastic along with original magazine and has not been inserted in the rifle. It will come with a second magazine sealed in plastic and the buyer has the option to purchase one additional unused magazine sealed in plastic at a discount. This SR-25 features a factory threaded gas block for use with suppressor.

Designed by Eugene Stoner (The designer of the M16/AR-15) and Reed Knight (owner of Knight Armament) to be accurate beyond 1000 yards. This SR-25 is the ""Match"" model which was Knight's most accurate variation of the SR-25. This rifle features a Match grade floating 24"" bull barrel; .820 diameter at muzzle; carbon fiber free-float hand guard with bipod adapter, and a chromed bolt carrier group.

I am the original owner and I purchased this SR-25 in 1994. This rifle has a very rare six digit serial number starting with a 1 (1214xx) rather that the customary five digit serial. The original instruction manual and care guide is included along with the original factory proof target showing this particular rifle's capabilities are sub MOA even before being lapped or broken in. Hard case is also included."

The ergonomics are fantastic, and the mechanicals are super reliable. You can easily manipulate both the magazine release and the slide release with just your right hand without having to adjust your grip. .40S&W has great stopping power, and yet you can get a hi-cap stacked magazine for it without feeling like you're holding a brick in your hands. Small enough to conceal easily, but large enough to shoot comfortably and accurately. Comes with a 10-rd magazine, yet hi caps are widely available online or at gun shows. There was a reason so many police officers carry this weapon-- this is serious tactical equipment. I've only fired 200 rounds through it since I've owned it, and I'll throw in a box of ammo. DAO, with night sights. You won't beat the price at any local shop, either.

This scope kit is the ideal hunting accessory for your Ruger 10/22 carbine. Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and you're ready for close-in fast moving targets.

8lb NY trigger spring- The 8lb New York trigger spring that gives constant takeup pressure on the trigger pull and provides a quicker trigger reset than the standard spring.  It is also a more reliable spring than the coil spring.  I have never seen one fail, contrary to the coil spring which does fail eventually. Use only with the 3.5lb or 5.5lb connector, not the 8lb connector.

This is the same treatment(NOT an oil or spray) that the FBI uses on their SWAT 1911s as well as other three letter agencies and military outfits like the Navy Seals. Google it, its not just a coating. It is SELF-LUBRICATING and the tolerances are amazing, which allows for all the internal parts to be treated as well. The only way to remove the treatment is to remove metal, literally.

These go for about 600-700 new. Last time I checked, there was a RIDICULOUS wait for Mr. Birdsong's treatment(about a year) and is a 200+ dollar job, depending on shipping fees both ways.

It is in great condition and fires very well. When I take it to the range, it never has any misfires, failure to feed, jams, etc. What can I say, Glocks are the best :) 

The gun has been well taken care of and cleaned regularly for maintenance as well as cleaned every time it was fired at the range. I used this weapon for concealed carry and recently bought another gun, so I'd like to sell this one. If you are looking for a concealed carry or home self defense weapon, this gun is perfect. There are many holsters available and it is very easy to conceal and very easy to shoot, even for the ladies (my mother had no problem shooting it).

The gun has only 1 modification: it has been upgraded to Tritium night sights. These sights look like normal sights during the day, but they glow at night (like a glow stick, sort of) to improve aiming at night. They do not use any batteries, it's a chemical inside that causes the glow, and it never has to be replaced.

It comes with 2 10-round magazines, 1 12-round magazine, and 1 15-round magazine. It comes with the original locking Glock hard case (with cable lock included), Glock speed loader (amazing little thing, helps you load the mags easily), and DeSantis holster as well. 

Any questions, please email me and let me know, I will respond as quickly as possible. Thanks for looking!"

SIG-produced pistols are used by the FBI, the DEA, the Secret Service, and the BATF, as well as a number of smaller federal agencies. The SIG pistols operate in a manner exactly like that required by the agency, and they operate with a degree of reliability that was unheard of only a decade ago for any auto-pistol, regardless of make or model."
