No cash price. I can't post pics but can send some if you want them. TEXT ONLY . Has three magazines and a bunch of other stuff. No tactical stuff though. Ask me anything about it. No ammo. 

Your Beretta must come with a bunch of magazines (At least 4. Must be 15 rounders). Maybe a holster. 3-dot sights preferred. Wood grips are nice but not a deal breaker. Ammo is optional. Extra parts are a plus. No INOX Berettas. I value my WASR for trade at around $700 and that's pretty darn good considering the market right now. If your trade value doesn't match my value you'll have to add cash. The more wear you have on the handgun the more money/accessories you'll have to add. I want keep keep this as near Greenwood as possible.

Don't NEED to get rid of this, but a handgun is a little more practical for me at the moment. Email me your number and we can text pictures. Thank you!"

A Description of the riser:

Rugged, yet lightweight riser mount positions your EOTech holographic sight .300"" higher, so your rifle’s iron sights are less apt to interfere with the EOTech’s reticle, while preserving co-witness capability. Also helps you maintain a more comfortable, heads-up shooting form. Clamps to your flattop rifle’s Picatinny rail with a single hardened steel setscrew; a securing tab up front locks into one of the rail’s slots to ensure a solid, recoil-proof fit. Precision machined from solid aluminum, then mil-spec hardcoat anodized for extra strength and wear resistance."

I'm going to entertain offers, as I know that I won't shoot this a whole lot and I've been wanting to lift my jeep for a while. I will also state, that I am not trying to ""screw anyone"" because of the current ""firearms frenzy"". I will show receipts to those honestly interested if they do not believe me. I am listing the EXACT prices of what I paid for everything. 

Rifle: 
This is a BRAND NEW *Unfired* Barrett M99a1. It has the 32"" heavy barrel with the ""New style muzzle break"", NOT the 29"" Fluted barrel. I purchased this on Dec 12th before the ""frenzy"" started. I ordered it online and drove to BudsGun's in Lexington to pick it up. I opened the case upon purchase to confirm condition of the firearm. This has NEVER been fired or even had a round chambered since purchase. 

The rifle comes with the factory Pelican case which contains:
    Rifle
    Unopened Otis Cleaning Kit
    Barrett Manual
    Multiple compartments (as pictured) in which you can place ammunition or      other goodies (I still have the foam pieces to block them off as well)

Optics: 
I purchased a Super Sniper 10x42 Mil-Dot, Rear focus optic as well as a set of Badger Ordinance Max-50 High rings for it from SWFA on Dec 8th. These were mounted by myself on Dec 22nd. 

Ammunition: Included with the purchase of the rifle is the following ammunition:

9rds of American Eagle 661gr FMJ
20rds of Hornady 750gr A-Max Match (one box was opened to look at it)
151rds (they gave me 1 extra) of Tactical Ammunition 647gr API

The API has a headstamp of ""LC09"". That being said, the tips do show their age.  Some of the tips have some of the silver marking rubbed off. 

Not Pictured (because I haven't yet received them from Barrett) is 16 10rd cases for the American Eagle and API Ammunition. These are the same ones that the Hornady Match rounds come packaged in. I didn't like the idea of having my API ammunition packaged loose in an ammo can, so I ordered the 10rd boxes for piece of mind.

Now for the breakdown. These prices are EXACTLY what I paid for everything. 

Rifle:  $3654.22
Scope/ Rings:   $490.35
Ammunition:  $360.09 (The Hornady A-Max rounds were purchased with the rifle, but were $54.99 per 10rds)
Ammunition Boxes:   $46.34

Total of:  $4551

That being said, I would like to get around what I paid because everything is BNIB and in new condition, which is [B]$4500[/B]. I would take a minor hit for a cash offer, but I don't want to loose much on this, since everything is new, and I don't HAVE to sell this by any means. 

So if you're interested, please feel free to email me or to text me. Honestly, if you are interested, and not just jerking my chain, the fastest way to get ahold of me is to text me. My number is seven six five 863-0322. If you text me, please state your name and that it's in response to the FS add. 



Thank you for looking and Happy New Year."

They didn't vote, because they realized they didn't have, and couldn't get, the number of votes needed to push it through. Things will be back to normal SOON. Stop paying crazy prices!

Edit: Ok, the hate mail is pouring in on me, mostly from those selling rifles and ammo on here. The vote was put off, and there are no plans of bringing it back up at this time. Most of the major supporters of the bill leave office next week, this ""ban"" was a failed, last ditch effort to save face. The people of Illinois have spoken, and it worked. Stay vigilant, keep calling your representatives, and being active in the pro-gun movement. The vote can be brought back up, though it's been proven to be very unlikely any such bill will ever pass.

The stores have plenty of rifles, and ammo is catching up. I bought 1000 rounds last night online, for $300, from a major retailer. Four years of stock was sold in two weeks, of course everybody is sold out. Believe me, they are still pumping out product as fast as they can. Give it a week or two, and see where the prices go.

I bought this AR15 in the early 90's. It's been fired right at 100 rounds. It's a Colt AR15 A2 Sporter II Model 6420 (serial number range ""SP343XXX).

 I also have some Pre-Ban (pre 1994) Thermold AR15 30 round mags for sale. These Mags Do Not come W/ the Colt AR15!

My have a ""21"" over the ""H"".

Caliber 30-06 Springfield (7.62×63mm) is the most used, the most popular, versatile and world wide spread hunting, as well military sniper caliber. 
Used in American military as a sniper caliber for many decades.
 From Wikipedia:
"" .30-06 Springfield
 Place of origin : United States. 
 In service: 1906–present. 
 Used by: USA and others. 
 Wars: World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, to present.
In military service, the 30-06 was used in the bolt-action M1903 Springfield rifle, the bolt-action M1917 Enfield rifle, the semi-automatic M1 Garand, the M1941 Johnson Rifle, the Famage Mauser, the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), and numerous machine guns, including the M1917 and M1919 series. It served the United States in both World Wars and in the Korean War, its last major use being in Vietnam. Large volumes of surplus brass made it the basis for dozens of commercial and wildcat cartridges, as well as being extensively used for reloading. In 1908 the Model 1895 Winchester lever action rifle became the first commercially produced sporting rifle chambered in 30-06.
Ballistically, the 30-06 is one of the most versatile cartridges ever designed. With ""hot"" hand-loads and a rifle capable of handling them, the .30-06 is capable of performance rivaling many ""magnum"" cartridges. The .30-06's power (combined with the availability of surplus firearms chambered for it and demand for commercial ammunition) has kept the round as one of the most popular for hunting in North America. With appropriate loads it is suitable for any small or large heavy game found in North America.
The .30-06 cartridge was designed when shots of 1,000 yards (900 m) were expected. In 1906, the original M1906 .30-06 cartridge consisted of a 150 grains (9.7 g), flat-base cupronickel-jacketed-bullet. After WWI, the U.S. military needed better long-range performance machine guns. Based on weapons performance reports from Europe, a streamlined, 173 grains (11.2 g) boattail, gilding-metal bullet was used. The .30-06 cartridge, with the 173 grains (11.2 g) bullet was called Cartridge, .30, M1 Ball. The .30-06 cartridge was far more powerful than the smaller Japanese 6.5×50mm Arisaka cartridge and comparable to the Japanese 7.7×58mm Arisaka. The new M1 ammunition proved to be significantly more accurate than the M1906 round. In 1938, the unstained, 9.8 grams (151 gr), flat-base bullet combined with the .30-06 case became the M2 ball cartridge. The M2 Ball specifications required 2,740 feet per second (840 m/s) minimum velocity, measured 78 feet (24 m) from the muzzle. M2 Ball was the standard-issue ammunition for military rifles and machine guns until it was replaced by the 7.62×51 mm NATO round for the M14 and M60. M2 bullet was considered optimal, and many rifles performed well. The U.S. Marine Corps retained stocks of M1 ammunition for use by snipers and trained marksmen throughout the Solomon Islands campaign in the early years of the war. In an effort to increase accuracy some snipers resorted to use of the heavier .30-06 M2 armor-piercing round, a practice that would re-emerge during the Korean War. Others sought out lots of M2 ammunition produced by Denver Ordnance, which had proved to be more accurate than those produced by other wartime ammunition plants when used for sniping at long range. Commercially manufactured rifles chambered in .30-06 are popular for hunting.Current .30-06 factory ammunition varies in bullet weight from 7.1 g to 14.3 g (110 to 220 grains) in solid bullets, and as low as 3.6 g (55 grains) with the use of a sub-caliber bullet in a sabot. Loads are available with reduced velocity and pressure as well as increased velocity and pressure for stronger firearms. The .30-06 remains one of the most popular sporting cartridges in the world. Many hunting loads have over 3,000 ft-lbs of energy at the muzzle and use expanding bullets that can deliver rapid energy transfer to targets.
One reason that the 30-06 has remained entrenched as an extremely popular round for so long is that the cartridge is at the upper limit of power that is tolerable to most shooters. Recoil energy (Free recoil) greater than 20 foot pounds (27.1 joules) will cause most shooters to develop a serious flinch, and the recoil energy of an 8 pound 30-06, firing a 165 grain bullet at 2900 ft/s is 20.1 foot pounds (27.3 joules). Recoil shy shooters can opt for lighter bullets, such as a 150 grain. In the same 8 pound rifle, a 150 grain bullet at 2910 ft/s will only generate 17.6 foot pounds (23.9 joules) of recoil energy. Young shooters can start out with even lighter bullets such as the 110, 125 or 130...""

I was out of town for Christmas and my phone and wallet were stolen. 

I am selling a VERY well maintained, like new (less than 500 rounds fired) Ruger SR9c. This is an amazing 9MM pistol that was named the 2010 Handgun of the Year for a reason. I honestly do not want to sell however we need the cash to fund a family emergency. 

Overview: 

Caliber:	9mm Luger
Grip Frame:	Black, High Performance, Glass-Filled Nylon
Sights:	Adjustable 3-Dot
Length:	6.85""
Height:	4.61""
Width:	1.27""
Grooves:	6
Barrel Length:	3.40""
Twist:	1:10"" RH

I have modified two areas of this already amazing weapon. 

I replaced the stock spring and guide rod. The original guide rod was plastic to reduce weight however I personally did not care for plastic on a part that needs to be sturdy. 

I also replaced the plastic striker indicator with a polished aluminum one. This reduced plastic on plastic friction and improved the already good trigger. 

Both modifications are from Galloway Precision and cost $63.50 + shipping. 

This pistol comes with ALL ORIGINAL pieces including the case, manuals, original casing fired from factory and all accessories. 

I am selling this one of two ways:

WITH Modifications - $450.00
WITHOUT Modifications (In its complete original state) - $420.00

I am willing to meet someone pending it is within a reasonable driving radius.

Caliber 30-06 Springfield (7.62×63mm) is the most used, the most popular, versatile and world wide spread hunting, as well military sniper caliber. 
Used in American military as a sniper caliber for many decades.
 From Wikipedia:
"" .30-06 Springfield
 Place of origin : United States. 
 In service: 1906–present. 
 Used by: USA and others. 
 Wars: World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, to present.
In military service, the 30-06 was used in the bolt-action M1903 Springfield rifle, the bolt-action M1917 Enfield rifle, the semi-automatic M1 Garand, the M1941 Johnson Rifle, the Famage Mauser, the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), and numerous machine guns, including the M1917 and M1919 series. It served the United States in both World Wars and in the Korean War, its last major use being in Vietnam. Large volumes of surplus brass made it the basis for dozens of commercial and wildcat cartridges, as well as being extensively used for reloading. In 1908 the Model 1895 Winchester lever action rifle became the first commercially produced sporting rifle chambered in 30-06.
Ballistically, the 30-06 is one of the most versatile cartridges ever designed. With ""hot"" hand-loads and a rifle capable of handling them, the .30-06 is capable of performance rivaling many ""magnum"" cartridges. The .30-06's power (combined with the availability of surplus firearms chambered for it and demand for commercial ammunition) has kept the round as one of the most popular for hunting in North America. With appropriate loads it is suitable for any small or large heavy game found in North America.

The .30-06 cartridge was designed when shots of 1,000 yards (900 m) were expected. In 1906, the original M1906 .30-06 cartridge consisted of a 150 grains (9.7 g), flat-base cupronickel-jacketed-bullet. After WWI, the U.S. military needed better long-range performance machine guns. Based on weapons performance reports from Europe, a streamlined, 173 grains (11.2 g) boattail, gilding-metal bullet was used. The .30-06 cartridge, with the 173 grains (11.2 g) bullet was called Cartridge, .30, M1 Ball. The .30-06 cartridge was far more powerful than the smaller Japanese 6.5×50mm Arisaka cartridge and comparable to the Japanese 7.7×58mm Arisaka. The new M1 ammunition proved to be significantly more accurate than the M1906 round.[6]
In 1938, the unstained, 9.8 grams (151 gr), flat-base bullet combined with the .30-06 case became the M2 ball cartridge. The M2 Ball specifications required 2,740 feet per second (840 m/s) minimum velocity, measured 78 feet (24 m) from the muzzle.[7] M2 Ball was the standard-issue ammunition for military rifles and machine guns until it was replaced by the 7.62×51 mm NATO round for the M14 and M60. For rifle use, M2 Ball ammunition proved to be less accurate than the earlier M1 cartridge; even with match rifles, a target group of 5 inches (130 mm) diameter at 200 yards (180 m) using the 150-grain (9.7 g) M2 bullet was considered optimal, and many rifles performed less well.[6] The U.S. Marine Corps retained stocks of M1 ammunition for use by snipers and trained marksmen throughout the Solomon Islands campaign in the early years of the war.[8] In an effort to increase accuracy some snipers resorted to use of the heavier .30-06 M2 armor-piercing round, a practice that would re-emerge during the Korean War.[9] Others sought out lots of M2 ammunition produced by Denver Ordnance, which had proved to be more accurate than those produced by other wartime ammunition plants when used for sniping at long range.[10] Commercially manufactured rifles chambered in .30-06 are popular for hunting.
Current .30-06 factory ammunition varies in bullet weight from 7.1 g to 14.3 g (110 to 220 grains) in solid bullets, and as low as 3.6 g (55 grains) with the use of a sub-caliber bullet in a sabot. Loads are available with reduced velocity and pressure as well as increased velocity and pressure for stronger firearms. The .30-06 remains one of the most popular sporting cartridges in the world. Many hunting loads have over 3,000 ft-lbs of energy at the muzzle and use expanding bullets that can deliver rapid energy transfer to targets.
One reason that the 30-06 has remained entrenched as an extremely popular round for so long is that the cartridge is at the upper limit of power that is tolerable to most shooters. Recoil energy (Free recoil) greater than 20 foot pounds (27.1 joules) will cause most shooters to develop a serious flinch, and the recoil energy of an 8 pound 30-06, firing a 165 grain bullet at 2900 ft/s is 20.1 foot pounds (27.3 joules). Recoil shy shooters can opt for lighter bullets, such as a 150 grain. In the same 8 pound rifle, a 150 grain bullet at 2910 ft/s will only generate 17.6 foot pounds (23.9 joules) of recoil energy. Young shooters can start out with even lighter bullets such as the 110, 125 or 130...""

This package would cost well over $2100 to build new at today's prices for everything this package includes.  It does not need to be registered as a SBR ""Short Barrel Rifle"" because it has a 16"" barrel.  MechTech Claims a 60% increase in Muzzle velocity with their barrel.  This thing is a BLAST to shoot and it folds down to a very compact home defense weapon.  I am asking $1600 and I will consider Compact .45acp pistols in part trade.  I also like Colt revolvers.  What do you have?"

This revolver has had the trigger mechanism smoothed out, and the hammer strut has been threaded, allowing the trigger pull weight to be adjustable by turning a knurled collar (I believe this modification was done by Jim Clark Jr. of Clark Custom Guns).  The hammer spur has been removed, and carefully rounded-off and polished (looks like it was done at the factory).  The hammer can still be cocked for single-action firing, if desired.  Included are three Pachmayr rubber grips (one compac with covered backstrap, one with covered backstrap and finger grooves, and one with exposed backstrap.  The fourth grip in the picture is a duplicate and is not included) and four speedloaders (three Safariland, and one HKS).  I purchased this revolver in the 1980's already modified, and have fired less than 500 rds. through it since!  It was strictly a range gun and home defense weapon for me, and never carried in a holster.  I found it to be the perfect size: only slightly larger than the popular SP-101 and with 20% greater ammo capacity (six rounds versus only five), and less weight and bulk than the GP-100 series.  The Ruger ""Six"" Series revolvers are considered to be stronger than the equivelent S&W ""K"" frame revolver, in that they are able to withstand a constant diet of heavy .357 magnum loads without the cylinder losing time or stretching the frame.

My price is $625.00, face to face in N. Austin.  I'm not desperate to sell, so please don't make lowball offers (they will be ignored).  Trades for one or more firearms, +/- cash  may be possible (mostly ""tactical"" weapons), but I'm not very interested in hunting rifles or hunting shotguns, antiques, etc.  Mostly interested in a Gen 4 Glock 34 with all accessories.  No archery equipment, computers, jet skis, etc.  Serious buyers will provide me with a (local) phone number if they want to talk in person.  I won't give out my number unless I can contact you at yours (too many spammers & scammers).

The ammo is manufactured by Radway Green, a British manufacturer. I know it is in demand, and don't think you will find it for sell online. As you can see, I've added some pictures of what you would be buying. It will come in the ammo can as seen. I am not sure of the grain of the bullet but probably 147 gr. I do know it is non-magnetic. It was manufactured in 1989 and has the NATO cross and R.G. head stamp. It is brass cased.

I am selling it as is, I will not break it up. I prefer selling it FTF, but willing to make reasonable exception. I do have PayPal.

AR-15

LOWER RECEIVER
Sabre Defense was forced to close due to some unfavorable activities, so these lowers are getting harder and harder to find. The lower receiver comes mounted with a Mil-Spec Magpul CTR buttstock and a complete MIAD grip kit with all backstraps and A1 and A2 frontstraps. A GI-type single stage trigger is installed.

UPPER RECEIVER
The upper receiver is a Stag Arms 2HT. Basic features are:
16"" Gov't profile chrome lined barrel
1:9 twist rate
chambered for 5.56mm
Free-float quad rail
carbine-length gas system
The foregrip is a TangoDown ""Stubby,"" with Magpul rail ladders on the sections of rail that would be gripped. The A.R.M.S. #40L folding rear sight that originally came with the upper was replaced with an LMT fixed A2 rear. Stag is currently experiencing wait times of over a year for all of their products, so this may be your only chance to find one.

MAGAZINES AND MISC
Rifle comes with 10 30-round aluminum GI-spec STANAG magazines, arguably the hardest part to find right now. There is some writing on them in the pictures that will be cleaned off prior to shipping. Also included is the basic nylon two-point sling seen in the pictures. I also have an Aimpoint CompM3 CLONE that I can include. It holds zero well, but has a couple of issues: the bar that holds the front lenscap on fell out so the cap will fall off at the slightest movement, and the small button-cell batteries were lost long ago so I'm not sure what type it takes. Cosmetically it is of all-metal construction and has ""AIMPOINT"" stamped into the side, but is definitely a clone and not the real thing."

My dad purchased an AR-15 literally the weekend before everything went down in CT. I also got him a new 4x electric scope for Christmas.  He sits in his house with a laser .223 bore sight round adjusting his scope from 30FT to 50FT because he can't find any ammo to actually shoot the gun.

I realize it's scarce. But folks, it isn't that scarce. I can purchase .223 online all day for $0.75+/rd. Let's be real: that's ridiculous.

If you have any .223 ammo, let me know. It doesn't have to be a lot. I just want to get some for my father so he can actually enjoy his rifle. Hell, I don't even own anything that will shoot a .223 round.

I realize that it's fetching a premium and I completely understand the concept of supply and demand. If you have any that you're willing to sell at a reasonable price, give me a shout.  My name is Justin."
