 Description 
Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Pistol Model in 9mm. It's been stored and is in excellent condition. The gun pictured may have a different serial number, but is a NIB Uzi. 
The UZI pistol was developed by Israel Military Industries (now IWI Ltd) during early 1980s from the famous Micro-UZI submachine gun. Intended users for the UZI pistol were various security agencies and services which wanted a high-capacity semi-automatic pistol, and civilian shooters (mostly in USA) which also wanted such gun with ""cool Uzi style"". Despite somewhat rough appearance UZI pistols were reliable and quite accurate. It also must be noted that 'original' UZI pistols should not be confused with full-size weapons based on semi-automatic only full-size Uzi carbines but without the shoulder stock. 
UZI pistol is blowback-operated semi-automatic weapon which fires from closed bolt. It has a stamped steel receiver and the bolt is fully enclosed inside. Bolt is of 'telescoped' design, that is, it is hollow in the front and encloses the rear part of the barrel when in battery. Uzi pistol has a single action trigger and utilizes an internal sliding striker (firing pin). Manual safety of sliding type, and is located above the grip on the left side of the gun. Magazines are of double stack design, interchangeable with other guns of Uzi family (in 9mm caliber). Sights are of open type, with flip-up rear sight, adjustable for windage. The guns were manufactured and fully assembled in Israel. Action Arms imported them as complete guns. You'll get the highest quality UZI Pistol you can get.

Enough said!!

The SPAS-12 was designed by the Italian company Luigi Franchi Spa as a special purpose, military and police close combat weapon (actually, SPAS stands for Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun, or Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun, depending on the source). It featured a selective action for greater versatility, and can be used as a gas operated semi-automatic repeater or as a manually operated pump action repeater, depending on the mission and ammunition used. Since its introduction SPAS-12 became a very popular police and special-forces weapon, being versatile, reliable and with good firepower. On the other hand, it is heavier than most other similar shotguns and quite complicated, which results in relatively high prices.

SPAS-12 utilizes somewhat traditional for shotguns gas system with annular gas piston locating around the under barrel magazine tube. It operates the bolt with vertically tilting locking lug that engages the barrel extension to lock.SPAS-12 can be switched between gas operated self-loading mode and manually operated pump mode by pressing and holding a button at the bottom of the forearm and pulling the forearm slightly forward for AUTOMATIC mode or backward for PUMP(or MANUAL) mode. Earlier models of the SPAS-12 had the lever type safety at the front of the trigger guard, but due to some deficiencies this was latter replaced by the push-button (cross-bolt) safety at the same place. 

SPAS-12 could be fitted with stamped metallic butt-stock that folds to the top of the receiver when not in use, and with a pistol grip made of plastic. Alternatively, solid plastic butts-tocks with pistol grips are available. Barrel has cylinder bore with screw-on muzzle devices (cokes of flash hiders). Sights usually are of rifle type, with post front and open notch rear sight.

I brought this gun home, put it right in my safe and it hasn't been out in 6 months except to take the pictures for this ad.  Like the Scandium framed E-series I also have listed here, this gun has never been fired or even had a loaded mag in it.  It is in perfect, as new condition.

Everything that came with the gun when purchased new is included. That means the original case, two 8-round magazines, all paperwork, bushing wrench, safety lock and the factory test casing still sealed in the original envelope.

I also have 15 very high-resolution pictures of this gun that I will send to anyone interested. Posting pictures in this listing just makes tiny pictures that nobody can see, and they also do not allow links to external websites (Photobucket). Contact me through this listing and I will send you the link to the pictures.

$950 cash, FTF transaction. I live near the Akron-Canton Airport.

I also have the 4.25"", Scandium framed E-series model listed for sale here as well.  Please see my other listing."

The Inertia Driven® system allows the M2 to digest nearly any 12 gauge cartridge, from 2-3/4"" target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums.
Benelli engineers have also adapted the ComforTech® recoil system for the M2. This revolutionary system reduces felt recoil by up to 48% and cuts muzzle climb by 15%. When combined, this puts the shooter back on target up to 69% faster than with any other comparable semi-automatic shotgun. The M2 is not only faster, but with the new ComforTech® system, it may be the most comfortable shotgun you will ever shoot."

RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. The RFB is the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles...No trades,will ship to an FFL dealer.."

Back when everyone thought that the pump action shotgun couldn’t be improved, the Benelli Nova Pump proved otherwise. Completely original and innovative, the 20-gauge or 12-gauge pump incorporates a polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics make the gun not only pleasing to look at, but a delight to hold and handle. Distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and forend in place of conventional checkering provides a positive gripping surface and complements the innovative engineering of the Nova Pump. With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova 12-gauge shotgun and 20-gauge shotgun handle anything from target loads to 3-1/2"" magnums. The Benelli Nova Pump is the most versatile pump action shotgun ever made. I bought this at an estate auction of a man who was quite a collector and had a large quantity of shotguns. This shotgun appears to me to be unfired. The bore is clean and bright, and the bolt and chamber are perfectly clean. Comes with IC, M and F chokes, choke wrench, original documentation and box."

Here's the specs. 
With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations."

Gun appears to be unfired it is in 99% condition it comes with the two 30 rd mags, bayonet, and sling I do not have the box. All numbers match and it also has a very low serial number. I've seen these sell for over $2000 online if you can find one. I'm asking $1550 and I'm a little flexible on the price but not much but you know the saying cash talks. I'm mainly looking to sell but may consider trades but it would have to be something spectacular. I'll set the trade value at $1600. I'm only going to keep this on here for a few days until I can get the chance to put it on gunbroker. At this time I will not ship and must be a ftf deal in Greensboro."

 It is a 1972 13' Columbia. I have the title and I am the second owner. I will also be including the trailer in the pictures, along with the boat. The boat has been kept for and never stored In the elements. This would make quite the Christmas gift for that special person :)

The seats are all leather, and it seats four. It has a 45hp mercury engine. It has a perfect hull, and does NOT leak. It has two tanks for gas, and has a tow rope for pulling a skier or tube. It has a newer paint job done by the first owner. It has color changing chameleon paint used for the flames on the front of the boat. It also has a space in the dash for installing a cd deck. All in all this is a very fun boat, and will give you enjoyment for a long time.

I have had this boat out twice THIS year and it was a lot of fun both times and I had no issues starting, running or moving forward and in reverse. This boat has new tags and is ready for the water today.

More Information:

1966 was the Winchester Repeating Arms Company's 100th year of operation. To commemorate this occasion, Winchester produced a run of fancy Model 94 rifles. These were based on post 1964 Model 94's actions with a gold plated receiver and forend cap, brass ""rifle"" (curved) buttplate, saddle ring, and a heavy octagon barrel with a full length magazine that was nicely polished and deeply blued. The straight hand stock was select walnut. All were in caliber .30-30 Winchester.

The point to all of the gold and brass was to make the 1966 Centennial reminiscent of the brass framed Winchester 1866 ""Yellow Boy"" rifle that was Winchester's first product.

DOB 10-15-2010 comes with VZ grips shown on the gun and the factory original grips, Don Hume OTW holster, $ Sig case. Gun has been 100%, no FTF or FTEs. Bought for summer carry but have gone to a P232. Shot very little as this really is not a range size gun. I would say condition is 98%. Prefer FTF with CCW holder. Will ship to FFL for $20. Email is best way to contact. Willing to travel a little. Would consider trade for Walther PPKor PPK-S Blued.

The “Baby” of the Desert Eagle family offers an excellent handgun value and plenty of firepower. The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market. 
Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free."
