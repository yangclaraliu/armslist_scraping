The Ruger LC9 is a very compact and thin pistol that is perfect for concealed carry or back-up gun duties. Playing off of the incredibly popular LCP pistol, Ruger has chambered this pistol in the potent 9mm cartridge.
 The LC9 is a double-action only (DAO) pistol, fired by hammer, not striker. The pull is smooth, but not heavy.
 Super thin, this pocket gun is only 0.9"" wide. Seemingly impossible, the LC9 weighs only 17.1 ounces, yet still has a 3.12"" barrel, a 7+1 capacity and real, three dot sights.
 The LC9 frame is made of a high-performance, glass-filled nylon, while the slide and barrel are steel. The frame is black, and the slide is blued."

My PHP (Prvi Hrvatski Pistolj) MV-9.  The MV-9 is a handgun which was developed in Croatia during its war for independence in the early 1990’s.  The pistol was eventually replaced with the HS 2000 pistol, which design was adopted by Springfield as the XD-9.
By design, this pistol represents a mix between the Beretta 92 and Walther P389 pistols.  The basic short-recoil operated action with vertically tilting locking piece is similar to both pistols.  The general appearance of the open top slide is close to the Walther, but the single return spring below the barrel is apparently an Italian influence.  Trigger is double action.  The safety consists of a manual de-cocking lever, located on the left side of the grip frame.  Magazines are double stack and hold 15 rounds.
This Croatian weapon is relatively rare, since production ceased after a short run and did not pick up again until after the breakup of the former Yugoslavia had already started.  
I am asking $350.00 reduced to $325.00 CASH.  NO TRADES AT THIS TIME, unless it is of the 1911 style in .45ACP.

- I bought this gun from my best friend who is a Marine Scout Sniper team leader. He performed all of the modifications. I have seen him shoot 3 shot 1/4"" groups at 100 yards and 5 shot 1/2"" groups at 100 yards with this gun. I can provide his platoon information if this is in question.

The gun shoots superb; however, I have no place to shoot past 100 yards so I have no need for this gun.

in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. 
It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we 
designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external 
hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. 
""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready 
with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard 
primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and 
automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by 
resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. 
No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research 
indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. 
When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single 
action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually 
recharge and keep going.

The barrel is super easy toninstal. My first one I put on took m about 12-15 mins' but on my last MAC it took 4 mins to change the barrel. Its just a super well built easy to work with and has all the treads you'd ever need to have. Ihave them on all my MACs and M-11's. I just order one too many this last order, my fault will end up your win!

This barrel is very cool because it allows you to have multiple threads on just 1 high quality made barrel. I have them on all my SMG MAC and the first one i installed is still on and probably close to 24-28k rounds through it and still as accurate and has not faded any since the day it was installed. That's why I have them on all 6 of my SMG's .

For the barrel being sold, I opened the package to make sure it was perfect in aesthetics and to check the thread quality. At this time i felt the threads and they are very smooth with no rough marks. I tested the 1/2x28 threads with my AAC Ti-Rant 9 and it fit perfectly and snug on the 1/2x28 threads. I then checked my Bowers Group CAC Suppressor on the barrels other threads, the 3/4x10 threads and they fit tight and smooth as well. It truly is one of the best threaded barrels I own. I can honestly its just as good if not better that some of my several hundred dollar Jarvis Barrels I use on my high end pistols. If I'd had known about these sooner, I have no doubt I'd have them on more pistols.

It truly is a GREAT GREAT DEAL !

The 1/2x28 threads are standard on .22 as well as on astandard 9mm barrel so you can thread on suppressors and muzzle brakes. The other thread ¾ X 10 is the standard thread for the M10/9 and M11/9 which will also fit any sub gunsilencer like Gemtechs Viper or Bowers CAC, just to name a few. This Barrel Fits any MAC, M/10, M-11 SMG, Semi Auto and MPA mid sized 9mm."

Sorry for the following statement, but past experience listing on the site shows it to be necessary. 

Do not waste your time or mine offering me a ridiculous amount. I am firm on the cash price, as it is about $120 off retail (tax or FFL transfer fee included) for a nearly new pistol. If you believe the price to be too high then feel free to purchase somewhere else, but don't bother telling me that you found one online for less. I know what these go for and for anything less I will keep them. I am also not interested in garbage firearms; these are quality weapons (with expensive accessories) and that is all I will accept in exchange. All other offers will be ignored."

I have for sale a Sig Sauer P220R Carry that I purchased a few months back. I have put 300 flawless rounds through it. It comes with everything it came with from the factory (case, two 8-round magazines, and lock). 

I also have additional items for additional charge: one 10-round factory magazine, a Blackhawk Serpa holster, 20 rounds of Speer Gold Dot hollow points, and a Surefire X300 rail mounted weapons light. All together I have just over $1,200 into this setup.

I am primarily looking for a trade with cash in either direction as necessary, but will sell if you have cash in hand. I am after the following trades:

1. S.A. XD(M) 3.8"" Compact .45 ACP
2. Vortex Viper PST 1-4x optic
3. Troy Industries Alpha Rail 13""-15"" w/ or w/o folding sight
4. Troy Industries front folding M4 sight

The P238 has been sold.

Sorry for the following statement, but past experience listing on the site shows it to be necessary. 

Do not waste your time or mine offering me a ridiculous amount. I am firm on the cash price, as it is about $125 off retail (tax or FFL transfer fee included) for a nearly new pistol. If you believe the price to be too high then feel free to purchase somewhere else, but don't bother telling me that you found one online for less. I know what these go for and for anything less I will keep them. I am also not interested in garbage firearms; these are quality weapons (with expensive accessories) and that is all I will accept in exchange. All other offers will be ignored."

 I am having a HARD time parting with this being that I like to keep silver & gold for emergency reasons. But I really want another gun so you have got to talk me into it with something good...

I have here 1 troy lb.. That's right one troy POUND. of .999 fine silver in this neat little plastic suction seal. Ebay has similar proofs selling in the $515-550 range right now.

Minted in 1986, it's been sealed in the package ever since, serial #0133. Not a speck of tarnish on it. Comes with the stupid little certificate thing, yeah I don't care about it either.

For the right deal I may consider adding one of my C&R rifle collection.

This is a very nice Preduzece 44 mod.98 Karabiner 98k. It is a little diffrent in that the yugo crest was scrubbed off for some unkown reason. I have been told that it was possible that it was captured in the yugoslave wars and the crest was removed possibly around 1990. Either way its a fine example of a k98 and has a nice bore with strong rifling, with that said it has some frosting do to the corrosive ammo but the pics will show the strong rifling. BETTER PICS AVAIBLE UPON REQUEST.

There are 6 waffen marks on the rifle wich are hard to see in the pictures but they are there. The rifle has been well oiled and always remains clean as the finish is worn as can see in the pic but no rust has developed. There is a nice petina on the bolt. BETTER PICS AVAIBLE UPON REQUEST.

This rifle will be sold with 465 rounds of 8mm ammo but please take into consideration this is a package. The ammo is 16 boxes of 15 round star marked snipper ammo, 14 boxes of brown boxed 15 round yugo ammo, and 2romanian boxes of 15 steel core rounds for a total of 465 rounds. This is a great way to get into the kar98 playground and is a great deal. Also included is a yugo bayonet, high quality reproduction 98k sing with the correct double hatching and stiching, original cleaning rod, 8 8mm tipton brushes,and 30 empty stripper clips. 

This package would be great for any collector, renactor, our anyone who wants to just shoot a k98 as it will have everything you need to get started at a good price.

LNIB Hi-Cap 1911 style factory competition pistol based on what Todd Jarrett used to win the 1996 IPSC World Shoot.  It has many match grade parts and is designed for accuracy. This is a like new, Canadian built (some say those were better) Para-Ordnance P14-45 Signature.  Low serial number (3000 range).  The trigger is light and crisp, has adjustable sights, has a match grade barrel and bushing, beveled mag well, and more.  This was Para's first production competition gun.  The Limited followed a few years later and in general used less expensive parts to meet a lower price point.

I purchased new in 12/1997 and shot three boxes of ammo (150 rounds) through it.  The feel and accuracy was amazing. I started having children shortly after that and this became a gun safe queen, getting cleaned and oiled annually but not shot.  It is beautiful and in pristine condition.  

It comes with seven factory 14 round pre-ban mags (costing $50 - $80 each, but being pre-ban are still more valuable in states that ban hi-cap mags unless pre-ban), one factory 10-round mag (came with the pistol), and three aftermarket 10-round mags.

I started shooting Glocks a few years ago and haven't been as interested in the 1911 style pistol since then.  I'm selling this to purchase a rifle that I would shoot more. 

If you're looking for something different, special, and like new then this is it.  Perfect for IDPA competition or as a full-size concealed carry firearm. Email me if interested and I will reply with my phone number.

BTW, this is a link to a two-page report from 1998 about this pistol (it's in PDF format) - http://tinyurl.com/cwobto9.  It is a good write-up and has additional pictures."

This barrel is very cool because it allows you to have multiple threads on just 1 high quality made barrel. I have them on all my SMG MAC and the first one i installed is still on and probably close to 24-28k rounds through it and still as accurate and has not faded any since the day it was installed.

For the barrel being sold, I opened the package to make sure it was perfect in aesthetics and to check the thread quality. At this time i felt the threads and they are very smooth with no rough marks. I tested the 1/2x28 threads with my AAC Ti-Rant 9 and it fit perfectly and snug on the 1/2x28 threads. I then checked my Bowers Group CAC Suppressor on the barrels other threads, the 3/4x10 threads and they fit tight and smooth as well. It truly is one of the best threaded barrels I own. I can honestly its just as good if not better that some of my several hundred dollar Jarvis Barrels I use on my high end pistols. If I'd had known about these sooner, I have no doubt I'd have them on more pistols.

It is new with no package. I bought it, but due to some recent medical issues with my wife, I just don't have time to hunt or use this. I put batteries in it to make sure in functioned. From Primos's website:

All the advantages an electronic call can offer are yours with the e-Predator™. Place the e-Predator™ speaker set where you need the predator to go and set-up where you are concealed. The e-PREDATOR™ remote works up to 50 yards (150 feet) away. Other electronic calls produce sounds that pale in comparison to the realism of the sounds of the e-Predator. When you want an electronic call that actually ""Speaks The Language®"", you want the e-Predator™.

Features:

Includes wireless remote
Tree strap
Replaceable batteries
Weather resistant
Remote works from 50 yards (150 feet)
Coyote howl, Rabbit distress, Fawn distress and Rodent scream

I also have a new/no package Mojo Critter decoy. All I have done was open the package, but have not tried it.

I'd like to sell them both together, but if that doesn't work, I may consider splitting things up. I can email pics upon request.

$60  for both. I am willing to ship these for those interested.

This is a stainless steel CMMG conversion kit to make any AR15 into a .22 LR. Plinking just became a whole lot cheaper! I bought this conversion kit 2 weeks ago and cmmg won't let me return it. I bought it for $270, $300 after tax and shipping, and only asking $250 to get it off my hands. I've only cycled 200 rounds through it, works great. Exactly what I was looking for! I originally bought it cause I love to shoot my AR but ammo was getting expensive! $20 for 550 rounds of a .22 would last all day! This is the ""Echo"" model complete with charging handle and forward assist adapter. I would keep it but I just found out I'm getting a new smith and wesson m&p for a present, so I have no need for the conversion. This fits in any standard bolt carrier for AR15"

Its design is industrial contemporary, and is constructed with hardy solid wood and aluminum metal. The aluminum consists of diamond plate and smooth textures that have been hand-brushed. The foot pole and bar top work surface have been painted with durable oil based paint that has a hammered texture and look. The remainder of the bar has been painted black. There is plenty of storage, shelving, and top surface area. It additionally has a space designed for a mini-fridge and/or a wine cooler, or a kegerator. Speaking of wine cooler, the stainless steel one in the pics can be negotiated into the deal. The adult beverages stay though! The dimensions are 7' in length x 4' in height x 2' in width. This custom bar is heavy duty constructed and would take on average 4 men to pick up and move/transport.

This piece could be used in an inside or outside setting, and would be a great addition to an entertainment room or Man Cave. The bar is being offered at $950.00.  My name is Michael, and I can easily be reached at 843-442-201nine. Thanks for your interest.  You can view other pics of the bar at the below link:
