The 243 LBC is basically a 6mmAR the guy at BHW that had Dave Kiff build the reamer made him build it to a Spec where we can load it with 6PPC dies, So its very simple and cheap to load for Just One pass through the PPC dies and barely pump the shoulder of the 6.5 Grendel brass and you good to go, The 22 LBC is set up the same just have to run it through the 6ppc and then the 22ppc.

All dehydrated cans are factory sealed and most are marked ""1997"" as their purchased date (not expiration date). A neighbor just moved back east in January and sold us this supply of food. This lot is the last of three batches from them and has much of the best stuff. They personally used cans of food from this lot up until the day they left, and gave us the open ones for free. They said all of the dehydrated food never changed over the years. Also, the four Mountain House cans alone would cost over $100 from retailers.

Grampa's very good condition, all original 1930's 520 12ga takedown. This is the more ""expensive"" model from the 1930's (""Boy, she's a beauty!"" See: http://www.searsarchives.com/products/questions/firearms/detail/firearms_1933.htm) with the raised matted rib.  Marked ""Browning Patent"" on the barrel.  Diamond pattern on stock and forestock. 

Condition:  

A few dings and scratches on stock, a little finish wear. No cracks or separations on stock or forestock.  Bluing is 90-95% with a normal wear along sharper edges and tiny spot of rust on the outer receiver above trigger.  One small scratch on outer barrel.  Inner barrel is clean and shiny, no rust.  Action is smooth. 

Canvas bag, on the other, has seen better days - threads and leather have dried out and ends are worn open but could be sewn.  

Included is the original oak cleaning rod with wire brush and rag attachments. 

Grampa passed away more than 25 years ago.  I have never fired this gun (his Winchester 24 16ga double barrel, a different story).  I cannot say when the last time it was used.  Three different gun shops have given the ""OK to Fire"" but this 80-year old shotgun cannot be used for water fowl... no steel shot allowed.

Like most military innovations the civilian market would finally have their chance to get their hands on these reliable firearms. The MSAR 556 STG also known as the Microtech Small Arms Research 5.56 brings the Bullpup design to the civilian market. Over the past decade a great number of other firearms companies attempted to make Bullpup rifles, which for the most part ended up as complete failures. 

The Bullpup design is typically when the trigger mechanism is closer to the muzzle that the firearm’s receiver, which allows for faster point and shot techniques. This innovation leads to higher precision due to the length of the barrel, and more accurate fit in the user’s body. The MSAR STG 556 rifle uses almost identical specs as the Steyr Aug, although MSAR STG 556 has released information which states the design was Steyr Aug's with their own innovation. 

Taking a closer look at the operating design would lead most to believe the MSAR STG 556 is a Steyr Aug clone. The Steyr Aug like the SSG-556 rifles works on the gas piston blow back principal, evident in most modern firearms of our era, and have a handful of new features. We are proud to offer a wide selection of STG 556 rifles for the civilian markets, as well as accessories for SSG-556 rifles. The SSG-556 rifle also uses a great amount of innovations from other rifles like the m16 style rifles, such as the bolt forward assist. 
The changes to note from the Steyr Aug to the STG 556; bolt forward assist, three position safety, visible from all angles, ability to use left handed bolt, bolt catch for fast reloads. The STG 556 was redesigned from the ground up in the USA, by Microtech Small Arms Research. We are proud to carry a wide range of MSAR products, including the STG-556 rifle.

I have less than 100 rounds through this rifle. If you check out other websites you'll find that lowest price on these rifles is around $1600.00 bucks. This rifle comes with 3 magazines.

Never got around to getting my official permit though and so haven't really used this pistol at all. It has had exactly 12 rounds fired through it and it functioned perfectly.  Basically a brand new weapon.

A VERY slim single stack concealed carry gun.  A great shooter.

Also included is an ""Uncle Mike's"" belt holster which fits the weapon perfectly and was only worn at the range once.  I'm also throwing in 15 rounds of RBCD, 9mm ultra high performance/velocity blended metal personal protection rounds.  If you don't know about these rounds, they are about as good as it gets for stopping power.  If you ever (heaven forbid) need to engage with your personal carry weapon, these rounds will definitely get the job done.  Cost about 40 bucks for a box of 20. 

DESCRIPTION:

The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab."

Mag holds 7.  Small, lightweight, ideal for concealing.   Some people will deride the quality of this piece.  However, I got it from a relative after it had sat for years.   It was balky at first due to sitting so long but cleaning, polishing the ramp, feed and slide it now fires, ejects and loads reliably.  I've put several hundred rounds through it without a single jam.

It has no sights, safety or other go-gas to catch on clothing, making it easy to conceal.  I would not consider it a target gun.  Rather it's best suited for close range personal protection.  We can go to my rod and gun club and you can check it out.  

Included is a somewhat rough plastic case and a manual showing how to disassemble. (very easy to take apart).  Due to my fat fingers, I did rework the trigger to smooth the tip which rubbed.

This was my Grandfather’s gun and is in great condition.  I am selling it with the factory 5-round magazine, a right-hand belt-slide holster, and a box of ammo (can’t remember what brand/grain or how many rounds – please ask if it’s important to you and I will check). 

This is a great concealed carry handgun and has always functioned perfectly for me.  It has a 2.5” barrel so its small size makes it easy to conceal – a true “pocket pistol.”  I’ve shot a variety of different ammunition and all has functioned reliably. The single action trigger makes shooting clean groups at 10 yards fairly easy. Not a target pistol, but it will certainly fit the bill as a defensive piece.

This pistol was designed to be carried as a backup gun by law enforcement and security professionals or anyone desiring a small concealable weapon. Its marketing slogan was ""the smallest, most powerful"" backup weapon available.

$275 cash OBO.  Must meet face to face in the Eugene area. Must have a valid ODL and willing to sign bill of sale."

Included is a genuine Mossberg Turkey choke and custom open style red dot sight allowing you to simply put the dot on target and fire - both eyes open. 

This gun patterns very well. The 935 is arguably the best turkey gun made as the chamber is overbored allowing more compression of loads which translates into tighter patterns. This gun is an automatic and can handle 3.5"" shells no problem.

I don't know if it's the sight, the rail mount or the saddle mount it was attached to. I solved the problem by wedging the back of the sight up a bit.

This firearm was designed in Spain for a military officer sidearm. It actually has the military creed symbol stamped into the magazine slot. It somewhat resembles a miniature 1911 style handgun. Although fairly heavy due to the solid steel structure, i used this as an everyday carry for almost a whole year. This gun fires with precision and is extremely accurate. I have maintained it well since my original purchase. I got it with some tarnish however, being in the jewelry industry, i striped the gun down to bare and put it in the ultrasonic cleaner. I replaced the firing pin and other municipals which are hard to find nowadays. Having the ability to custom design at my family establishment, we can also manufacture parts down the road if necessary. The gun also has a magazine safety where that if so happen the gun was charged and the magazine was not inserted, it still is not capable of firing. Continuing on, This gun is immaculate other than a slight oil fill on the gripping from the webbing of your hand. It has become part of the steel. Since ownership i believe i have shot around 200-300 rounds through it. I have never had any major issues but maybe a slight jam here and there because i didn't clean the dirty ejector after use. This is a future collectible, for those who collect, im just ready to move on to a new toy."

This is a Beretta 92C L Type (Double stack) in EXCELLENT condition in the original blue box with 2 13 round mags.  This will round out your collection or you can re-sell it and make a few bucks.

These are no longer imported.  A small run was available a couple years ago and had the ugly safety message stamped in the slide.

This is ITALIAN MADE and the S/N dates to the begining of production (first year if I'm not mistaken) in the early 90's.  It is already hard to find but in this condition, it is downright scarce.

I am going to include two brand new holsters.  One is a USGI holster in the package and the other is a desert tan drop leg.  Neither have ever been used and I have never shot the gun.  Pics available for a serious buyer.

I will take paypal in the form of a gift to avoid the 3% fee or cash if FTF.  I would rather do a FTF transaction with bill of sale to legal NH residents but I will ship at the buyers expense to an FFL.

You will not find a better deal on this gun.  If sold (payment is received) by the weekend, I will throw in a nice surprise - 3 brand new hi cap mags for your full size 92 or 5 used GI AR 30 rnd mags - your choice!!

That's it guys.  The good deals on A list are few and far between.  I'm not rude, I return emails, I'm honest, and I'm not trying to get a million dollars for a $100 gun.

No trades on this please.  Just a great gun and accessories at an unbeatable price.

All the pics are of the actual gun - no internet photos.

Edit:  Once I the ad posted, the photos looked distorted.  They make it look really messy but it is just the way it transferred.  I can email the pics - they show it better.  99% gun."

Nothing wrong with this gun- I bought it new and carried it for about 5 months before deciding that this gun just really isn't for me; I like longer barrels, and either SAO OR DAO. I have cleaned this gun within 24 hours of every trip to the range.

If you're not familiar with these guns, it is a polymer frame, DA/SA striker fired, 'compact' .45ACP handgun. Has a red indicator on the back of the slide to indicate whether weapon is 'cocked', and a loaded chamber indicator on the slide just under the ejection port- which is also the extractor. Also, magazine release can be switched from left side to right side of frame. The safety also doubles as the de-cocker. This handgun also has the required 'drop safety', but DOES NOT have a 'magazine safety', meaning that the weapon CAN be fired WITHOUT a magazine inserted.

Up for sale is my brand new, unfired, Smith & Wesson M&P340 CT .357 revolver.  This is Smith's top of the line model.  The frame is made with a Scandium alloy, making this firearm incredibly light, however the strength of Scandium allows this firearm to shoot the powerful .357 cartridge.  I purchased this to conceal carry on some days, but have not had it out of the box yet, until tonight to take the pictures of it.  

Here is a link to SW's website showing the retail value and some information on the pistol:

This firearm has the Smith labeled Crimson Trace laser grips.  Trijicon front night sight, the original box and all paperwork is included.  I am putting this firearm at over $200 below is current value.

I'm putting the pistol on here well below it current value because I would like to make a quick sale and give someone a deal.  I've sold several firearms on this site before, and anyone who has purchased them from me I'm sure will attest I do not hide anything in my posts.  The gun I describe is the gun you'll see. I wouldn't expect this gun it to last very long, this is one heck of a firearm at a more than fair price. 

Please call or text me at REDACTED anytime day or night if you have any questions or would like to see the pistol.  I'll remove this post once the firearm sells.  

Thanks,

I think that it's obvious why I purchased it.  Someone really took some time to make a beautiful one-of-a-kind set of grips for this gun.

I'm putting this and a few other firearms on here tonight because I need to make a quick sale.

After looking closely at the pictures.  I just want to add that the first picture, showing the right side of the pistol, looks as if the finish is wearing off.  It is actually not at all, it's just a smudge mark from my fingers when I was handling the pistol while taking the pictures.  The finish is not damaged at all like the picture suggests.  -Thanks"

The Best of the Best.The Barrett Firearms 13200 REC7 ARMS SIR Rifle in 5.56mm features a 16-inch barrel, black finish, ARMS SIR quad rail, gas piston operation, Nickel Teflon Bolt Carrier and a 30+1 round capacity.The REC7 operating system was designed to be soldier-proof, the highest accolade as to which a firearm design can aspire. A minimal number of parts and a clean-running piston system add up to a low-maintenance design with increased reliability. The piston operated system keeps heat and fouling out of the receiver, which means less time cleaning and more time putting bullets where they need to go. Cooler parts last longer, cooler guns run longer. REC7 was made to run hard. The 17-4 stainless piston transferring energy to the bolt carrier is the most robust in the industry. Its hardened one piece piston is superior to multi-component designs. The bolt carrier, machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel features an integral piston strike face - no separate gas key to shoot loose and another industry first. This Rifle comes in a Barrett Tactical Soft Rifle Case.

I am available for call or text anytime, the number 1479-three01-0733  

I am not entirely sure what year the gun was made, but here is a little history behind the .244 Remington. As you may know, Remington introduced the .244 in 1955 (the same year Winchester introduced the .243). Remington misread the market and introduced their .244 caliber with a 1:12 twist designed to stabilize light varmint bullets whereas Winchester introduced their .243 with a 1:9 twist which proved more suitable for stabilizing the larger dual purpose (deer/varmint) bullets. The .243 dominated the market but Remington quickly learned from their mistake and began rebarreling in a slower twist as of 1958. By then, however, the damage had been done and sales of the .244 continued to suffer. In 1963 they pulled the rifle and reintroduced it as the 6mm Remington and the rest is history. 

The barrel is stamped ""Flaig Ace."" After a great deal of research I believe the rifle was likely built by or at least built on an Edwin Flaig barreled action. Flaig was an eccentric German-American from Millvale, PA. His rifles were reported to have been of excellent quality and there is some interesting information about him and his self proclaimed role in WWII. Without boring you to death suffice it to say that the rifle is in very good condition. It shoots well and is pleasant to carry.
