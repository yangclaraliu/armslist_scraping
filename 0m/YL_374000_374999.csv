It hasn't been on the market long, and with the demand for them, they are very hard to find. The round is a 300 Blackout and ranges from a 105 gr. supersonic round, to a 220 gr. subsonic monster round. It gives the size and power of an AK-47 on an AR platform and AR accuracy, long range, and dependability. The recoil is almost non-exsistent and it is suprisingly quiet, but packs a lot of punch. The ballistics of this round is amazing. It delivers so much energy to the target. If you have never heard of the 300 AAC Blackout please do a little research and you will see what I'm talking about. This gun is amazing. This one is an Olympic Arms assault rifle calibered for 300 AAC Blackout. It has a 16 in. Heavy Duty Stainless Steel threaded barrel with thread cover, pop-up iron combat sights, UTG Foldable Metal Foregrip, a $350.00 Barska 1x30mm Electro Holographic sights with a infra red crosshair reticle with a 3x30 Magnifier, adjustable butt stock, an ergogrip pistol grip, free floating weaver rail, 1 30 round Magpul pmag and 1 30 round factory mag.

I would keep it for my daughter, but it's not allowed in town. It runs perfect, rides perfect, turns perfect, and starts perfect. How many perfects til it get annoying????? Runs strong for a 90cc.  I really can't point out anything major wrong with this 4wheeler. All of the lights work. Has Forward/Neutral/Reverse.....all 3 are flawless. The body is in great shape. There is one bad spot that I found, and if you're not looking you won't see it. It's where the front left fender swoops down and flows into the nose.......it's cracked about 2 inches right there. The former owner tried to fix it with some body screws, but I don't think it worked very well. Nothing is bent that I could find. The wheels and tires are in great shape also. The shocks are good all around. I'm not cracked up on all the stickers, but, kids will be kids I guess. I was going to remove them before taking the pictures, but ran out of time. I didn't even wash it! The kicker works, but doesn't want to return on its own. I asked my boss (I work at an independent motorcycle/race shop) and he said that it ""just needs pulled out and cleaned"". I'm going to load it in the truck and have him fix it this saturday. If you want it tonight (19th) or tomorrow (20th), not a problem. Come get it, and when you get the time bring it to the shop (in Richmond) and I'll have it fixed for you.  These quads go for between $1300 and $1800!  I just figured that one of you guys out there might be in the market for one.  I'm interested in about anything as far as handguns go.

As I stated this lower is unused brand new and I am listing it for less than I paid for it (lower is 379.99 plus the shipping and the ffl transfer fee) you won't be able to buy this lower for this price alone, and on top of that you have the shipping and ffl transfer fee to figure in, my loss is really your gain.

(Springfield too), Springfield, Missouri","$ 1,200","Listed On: Friday, April 20, 2012",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Virgin Bulgarian AKSU Krinkov 7.62x39mm Milled Receiver Kit. I bought this New, Sealed-In-Plastic, non-Serial Numbered Kit from K-VAR. The first person to commit to purchase will also get the Bulgy Krink green Sling, Bulgy 4-Cell  Mag Pouch for 4-AK47 30rd mags, and a Bulgy Krink Cleaning Rod. All three were extra and were not included in the kit.
  These 7.62x39 Kits are rare now and no longer available from K-VAR. Last time that K-VAR offered them, they were in the $1500+ range.
  This kit is pristine, has the correct 23mm barrel, and can be used for either milled or stamped receivers: (There's only 2 differences: the lack of a front trunnion, which can be found--use the Yugo M92 Krink front trunnion for a simple solution, or use any 23mm AK47 front trunnion and narrow the Hinged Receiver Cover Block by about .030"", and it will fit. I can e-mail pics of exactly what needs to be narrowed. (small area)
  The other difference is the Handguard Set. I have the Stamped Receiver set in laminated wood, (awesome). Don't ask me why K-VAR sent me a Milled kit with Stamped Handguards, I didn't know until later on. But I wouldn't send them back, they're too nice. 
  If you're familiar with Krinks, you'll know that this is a great buy, a steal! The only reason I'm giving it up is because I've found one already built and don't need two. (I wish, but just can't keep two).

Congrats to the person that confirms and send funds first. This is ALL genuine Bulgarian, including the hammer-forged barrel. Thanks for your replies.

I have many pics of the kit and will send them to interested buyers upon request.

NOTE: Thanks, but no trades and $1200.00 is absolute FIRM.

The Mossberg 930 SPX Tactical has an aluminum receiver, a tactically sound 18.5” steel barrel, an extended magazine tube and a tough but lightweight synthetic stock. The gas-operated, semi-automatic shotgun is a direct descendant of the excellent Mossberg 930 hunting guns. The shared self-regulating gas operating system reduces recoil and eases stress on its components by venting whatever excess gas isn’t required to cycle the action.

The system uses two gas ports in the barrel to power a piston that surrounds the magazine tube under the barrel. The set-up gives the Mossberg a bit of a chunky for-end (to accommodate the moving parts), but nothing that looks out of place. The 930 SPX functions smoothly and reliably without a gas seal ring. An added bonus: the 930 SPX also field strips without a lot of drama."

The 455 model will eventually consolidate all of the receivers currently used in the 452 line into one common platform.  This combined with the new interchangeable barrel system of the CZ 455 will allow the user to easily change the stock configuration as well as the caliber of their rifle.  The 455 retains the accuracy and quality of the adjustable trigger, hammer forged barrel and billet machined receiver from the CZ 452.  Improvements that the 455 brings include new manufacturing technology and tighter tolerances for improved accuracy and smoother operation.

I didnt want to use a piece of junk airgun so I bought a decent one in this Titan. I had a Benjamin when I was a kid and it was scary accurate - this Titan is cut from the same cloth as its grandpa I guess because it is a half inch grouper at 25 yards with Beeman pointed hunting pellets. I put on a set of ultra high scope rings to accomodate a 50MM bell scope and then I bought a Barska 6.5 - 20 x 50 Varmint with target dot reticle and resettable target turrets for like $90. Its a great little set up to shoot pigeons/gophers/grackels with so someone who has a pigeon problem could fix it really quick with this. The only reason Im selling it is because at the dairy I can shoot my .22 Savage silhouette target rifle and its awesome.

We bought it early 2011 and put a new deck and stringers in it. Also replaced all of the expanding flotation foam in the hull. The deckk was covered with 2 coats of WHIT Herculiner truck bed liner for a waterproof durable coating. I also recover most of the seats with Marine grade vinyl red in color. It has a 4.3 liter OMC COBRA Inboard Outboard engine and lower unit. I serviced the lower unit last year with new synthetic lube and a new lower unit water pump. New fuel lines and in line fuel filter also installed. We only took the boat out 6 times last year, and wont be taking out anymore due to family situation changed and there will be no-one at home to watch and take out the dogs.... I have a clear title to the boat, the trailer does NOT have a title. I had it weighed so I could tag it. The registration on the boat is still good for 2 more years. The boat runs good, does 38 mph on the lake with the family on board. I also put in all new gauges and a high speed depth finder. It also has a marine grade cd plyer with auxillary inputs for usb or 3.5 mm plug. It is 19.5 feet in length, and gets lots of compliments. The last time we took it out was july of last year, we wanted to go more, but purchased a house that needed rehabed, so that took priority. The last time out, I got too close to the bank when we were at anchor and grinded the prop a bit on rocks. It just took a little off of the top end of one of the blades, and maybe 1 mph off of top speed. I will let everything go with the boat to make it water ready including life jackets sea doo brand sea scooters (2 of them), a single seater tube and rope. And the other things required by law. I am willing to take a partial trade for a firearm or 2, but not the entire amount. If you want to talk cash come and look at it. I do everything possible to not get into that via phone or email."

I also have the second factory flush base plate as well. I am also including a box ( 42 rounds ) of Hollowpoint ammo, and comes with a Brand new just purchased Houge grip, comes with 2 backstraps. It has been fired 50 rounds through it to function test, I just want a .40 or .45 for carry.


HERE IS SOME INFO ABOUT THE GUN FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW:


The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back strap) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size. 
The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin.
The grip angle of the GLOCK “Safe Action” Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol.



 The smallest back strap is integrated in the GLOCK MBS Frame reducing the trigger distance of the standard size frame by 2 mm. The medium back strap is a 2 mm back strap offering equal size of a standard frame. The large back strap is a 4 mm back strap. 

 The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts. 

 Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps. 

 Internally, the original recoil spring has been replaced with a dual recoil spring assembly. The dual recoil spring assembly noticeably reduces the recoil while simultaneously increasing the life cycle of the assembly. . 



So to recap this package is going to come with:

Pierce +2 round extension for the magazine

Brand new Houge grip

42 rounds of 125 gr hollowpoint ammo


I am looking to trade for a

Glock 36 3rd gen (must be like new, no wear or scratches) 

Glock 27 3rd gen  (must be like new, no wear or scratches) 

Glock 26 3rd gen  (must be like new, no wear or scratches)

SOLD! SOLD!

Saiga 7.62 X 39mm. Sold as you see in the photo with the exception of the scope.  The magazines and stock/handgrip are all US made and therefore constitute a ""poor mans"" 922 compliance for the time being. Converting this rifle would make a great father/son project. Illustrated photos and instructions on how to do so are freely all over the web.

I replaced the top cover with another one that has a built-in picatinny rail on it. Just mount your own scope and rings. The original cover is shown lying under the rifle in the photos below and will be included. The Barska 4-16X50 scope *IS NOT* included in this price, although it may be had as seen for an additional $100. It is an 'Green' illuminated sniper scope and this bad boy reeeeally zooms in.

This gun is a blast to shoot and has never had failures, stove-pipes, etc. You pull the trigger, it goes ""boom"". It's that simple. I am the second owner and estimate this gun to have fired somewhere very near 500 rounds only. It is by no means a worn-out rag. If you want to get attention at the range, this will do it. Most people have no idea what it is.

I would not get rid of it but I just don't shoot it that much and would rather generate funds for other firearms projects. I'm not starving. Lowballers can go take a flying leap and will be ignored, not cheerfully either.

It comes with three 30 round mags and three 10 round mags. I also have about 600 rounds of Silverbear non-corrosive, berdan-primed ammo for sale for $135. The ammo will not be sold separately unless the prospective rifle buyer declines it.

Price $400 FIRM without scope. $500 FIRM with scope and rings as seen. FTF in Clark County with DL and LTCH in hand so I can make sure I'm not selling to a felon.

I have a CCW / Mother's Day Package Deal for trade or sale.  This is a Taurus PT-25 (.25 ACP) pistol package deal.  Great pocket pistol and it fills your hand (easy to shoot).  CCW Package comes with the following:

PT-25 Taurus Pistol w/1 magazine
2 x additional 9 round magazines
1 x pocket holster
1 x ankle holster
Over 100 rounds of .25 ACP (mostly practice, some self defense)

Bought this as a backup and then thought my wife would want it.  She’s not a semi-auto Lady, more of a revolver type.  I’ve put about 100 flawless rounds through this pistol, the barrel is bright and the weapon is clean.  It’s sat in my safe for the last year plus, and if nothing good comes along, it’ll sit there even longer ;).  Definitely not a close and destroy weapon, but a great backup or CCW for someone who might be recoil sensitive or simply wants a light weight pistol w/10 rounds.   

Email me (use the link) if you are interested in a trade or purchase.  Give me your best offer.  

Thanks!"

The Mossberg 930 SPX Tactical has an aluminum receiver, a tactically sound 18.5” steel barrel, an extended magazine tube and a tough but lightweight synthetic stock. The gas-operated, semi-automatic shotgun is a direct descendant of the excellent Mossberg 930 hunting guns. The shared self-regulating gas operating system reduces recoil and eases stress on its components by venting whatever excess gas isn’t required to cycle the action.

The system uses two gas ports in the barrel to power a piston that surrounds the magazine tube under the barrel. The set-up gives the Mossberg a bit of a chunky for-end (to accommodate the moving parts), but nothing that looks out of place. The 930 SPX functions smoothly and reliably without a gas seal ring."
