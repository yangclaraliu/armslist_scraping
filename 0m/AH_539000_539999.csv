The moment you unholster, the Burris ShotCam with Laser (300225) automatically begins recording high-quality digital video and audio of events as they occur. Every visual detail, every sound, every action is documented for later analysis.

The encrypted video/audio supercedes any questionable, conflicting or biased eyewitness accounts and can dramatically reduce personal, departmental and jurisdictional liability.

Footage can also be used to help identify suspects who have managed to flee the scene. And the Shotcam, when removed from a weapon, can continue to provide video, still frames and audio of a crime scene and witnesses.

An ultra-bright 120 lumen tactical illuminator and adjustable class IIIa laser add utility. And the compact, lightweight Shotcam is easily mounted to shoulder-fired weapons as well as tasers.

Shotcam and other accessories mount easily to duty shotguns using the Burris Tri-Rail mount for magazine tube extensions.

Shotcam is also proving invaluable as a weapons training tool. Shooting form can be analyzed at the precise moment of fire and shooters can use Shotcam for independent self-evaluation.

Training Applications

ShotCam provides trainers a whole new platform from which to educate and demonstrate weapons handling and shooting skills. Using video or recoil-activated high resolution still photographs, a trainer can better assess a shooter's form at the precise moment of fire. On a computer monitor, the trainer can then show the shooter the effects of proper or improper shot execution. A shooter can even utilize ShotCam independently for his/her self evaluation.

Liability concerns do not start and stop with law enforcement. ShotCam can provide your best evidence when presenting your self-defense arguments in court.

Record the action on a predator hunting adventure for later analysis and to share with others"

The foundation is a fully machined aluminum frame for reduced weight. When combined with the carry cuts, ball endmill cuts, round butt frame, concealment beavertail grip safety and hammer, the Ultralight Carry is over 1/2 pound lighter than a comparable steel frame pistol. Experts agree the ultimate carry pistol must be as light as possible while maintaining the shootability of a 5” pistol. The Ultralight Carry is handcrafted with all the features imperative in a daily use pistol. To reduce the profile and improve comfort, we have incorporated our new concealment beavertail grip safety, a round butt frame and carry cuts / ball endmill cuts on the slide. The slide stop post has been countersunk to allow the use of laser grips completing the features necessary in a daily concealed carry pistol.

This is a collectors grade rifle. No re-arsenal markings or signs of refurbishment anywhere on this rifle. It has all matching numbers on the bolt, carrier, stock, receiver, receiver cover, magazine, trigger guard, rear sight, and gas tube. It has the original blade bayonet, original cleaning rod, original cleaning kit, 10 stripper clips, 200 rounds of Russian match grade 7.62x39 ammo, and case. The bore is bright and shiny with strong rifling. The bluing is original and none of the pats have been painted over later. The stock is its original dark hardwood finish and has the original serial number without being forced matched and having a bunch of XXXXX's over the old serial number. The stock has no cracks or deep gouges, just minor handling wear. The receiver cover is marked with the Tula star inside the star logo and has the date stamp of 1952r under the logo. I bought this gun over a year and a half ago and it has sat in the safe ever since. I have never fired it, and never planned to in order to keep it in the collectors condition it is currently in. I know what this gun is worth as would any serious SKS collector so please don't try to low ball me and compare this with the Yugo's and Norinco's out there. Take a look at gunbroker for similar condition rifles and you will see that there are few out there and are worth every bit of my asking price. 

Asking $675 and I am not looking to trade, only sell outright at this time. I am located in Dublin and if you want to buy this, you must be willing to meet me in this area. My job doesn't typically allow me time to travel beyond the Dublin area. If interested, email or PM me. Thanks for looking."

This model was made in the early 70's, and has the dark deep rich blueing that appears almost black.  The finish is 95% or better, and timing is perfect, no end-shake, indexes perfectly, and the fit and finish rivals anything being made today by any maker.  It is reliable, accurate, and with a 3"" barrel is the perfect choice for concealed carry while not sacrificing accuracy.  I challenge you to find a 3"" .38 by any maker....they are not easy to find since most people that have them never sell them!  I recently picked up a S&W 3"" blued revolver, so no longer need this one.
The barrel is whistle clean, no pitting, and there is no chipping, marks, or evidence of drops to the gun anywhere.  There is a slight turn ring on the cylinder.
Located in Spartanburg, and asking $250, which is a very fair price, but could probably get more based on condition and market scarcity.  Email with any questions or to arrange payment and pick-up.  Not looking for trades, thank you!"

Spain was in the process of implementing the CETME assault rifle, but there were not enough of the new assault rifles for issue and training. They did, however, have stockpiles of older Mauser bolt action rifles (1916 and 1943 models). They developed a rifle that not only could be used to arm non-combatant and “Guardia Civil” troops, but also would fill the gap in training purposes until more CETME assault rifles were produced. The Spanish Special Purpose FR7 and FR8 rifles were born. These rifles were designed to shoot the 7.62mm NATO cartridge and have a birdcage flash hider that is designed to fire NATO rifle grenades. Under the barrel there is a hollow tube that looks very similar to a semi-auto rifle's gas assembly. Its function is to hold the bayonet adapter and store cleaning equipment.

Bayonet is not included, but is widely available.  Stock is solid wood, and measures 39 inches, 19 inch barrel, 8.2 lbs.  Dual diopter or notch rear sight (selectable).  Metal has been parkerized, looks new, and barrel/bore is clean and straight, good lans and grooves.

Receiver is marked with ""Fabrica De Armas"" with a logo, and ""La Coruna 1955"" underneath the crest.

Here is exactly what the ATF 'Federal Firearms Regulations Reference Guide' (ATF P 5300.4) says:

(B9) May a nonlicensee ship a firearm by carrier?
A nonlicensee may ship a firearm by carrier to a resident of his or her own state or to a licensee in any state. A common or contract carrier must be used to ship a handgun. In addition, Federal law requires that the carrier be notified that the shipment contains a firearm and prohibits common or contract carriers from requiring or causing any label to be placed on any package indicating that it contains a firearm. [18 U. S. C. 922( a)( 2)( A) and 922( e), 27 CFR 178.31]

(B8) May a nonlicensee ship a firearm through the U. S. Postal Service?
A nonlicensee may mail a shotgun or rifle to a resident of his or her own state or to a licensee in any state. Handguns are not mailable. A common or contract carrier must be used to ship a handgun. A nonlicensee may not transfer any firearm to a nonlicensed resident of another state. The Postal Service recommends that longguns be sent by registered mail and that no marking of any kind which would indicate the nature of the contents be placed on the outside of any parcel containing firearms.

The SE-2 is the first and only AR-15 pistol grip to be integrated with an ambidextrous sling mount. The SE-2 is available in two versions. The Hook Mount provides a loop compatible with most common sling hooks; The Swivel Mount allows the attachment of push-button sling swivels. 

The SE-2's sling mount is located above the hand and below the buffer tube, with a low profile design that stays out of the way of even fully collapsed M4-style stocks. When added to AR pistols, the SE-2 provides excellent one-handed control while providing sling attachment that doesn't clutter up the receiver extension.

Extensive strength testing has been performed on the SE-2 to ensure a reliable attachment point that you can depend on.

Just like the original SE-1 Pistol Grip, the design of the SE-2 enhances weapon ergonomics and functionality, bringing M16, M4 and AR-15 style weapons to a higher level of control and comfort. The grip has been designed for a wide range of hand sizes and shooting demands. Features include a smooth integral trigger guard to increase comfort, textured surface for added grip and storage for batteries or other equipment.

The SE-2 Sling Grip is available in Black, Earth  and OD Green"

Product Specifications
UPC Code: REDACTED65
Manufacturer: Tannerite
Model: Half Brick
Type: Target
Description: 1/2 Pound
Units per Box: 4Pk
Manufacturer Part #: 1/2 BR
Tannerite is intended to detonate when shot by a high-velocity firearm cartridge (firearms). Low-velocity handgun or rifle ammunition will not initiate a detonation.[2]

Tannerite is used by shooting clubs to provide explosions for their participants in large-scale weaponry demonstrations or other events. Ordinarily, firing rifle caliber machine guns and long arms will not produce much more than sound upon impact of the round on the target. With reactive targets, these shooting clubs can provide a movie-like experience such as exploding cars.

The manufacturer recommends using no more than 0.5-pound (0.23 kg) of the mixed composition at once, for safety reasons.

Tannerite detonations occur at a very high velocity, producing a large explosion and cloud. It may be useful for persons who are firing at long ranges; in this scenario, a long-range rifle shooter emplaces targets, retreats to his firing position, and fires. The shooter does not wish to have to walk down range to see if he has a hit—the Tannerite will detonate and serve as an indicator.

It also has uses as a general explosive that, prior to mixing, can be sold, transported, and stored in the United States without any special permits."

Most of the rounds are HP or JHP. It comes with Hogue grips and the factory wood as well. I'm interested in trading for another gun or possibly cash; so let me know what you have. I can throw some cash in with it too if it's a good deal. 
This particular model is hard to come by because it has the external hammer and is in such good shape. I have completely replaced all the internals and springs and it is flawless. Great gun to carry because it's small, but with those HP and JHP rounds, still packs a punch! This model only runs .38 spl ammunition, NOT .357!

REDACTED VERY accurate and nite sites.


The Kahr P380 is a true pocket pistol, weighing about 11 ounces empty, measuring less than five inches long and less than four inches high. The P380 bears a striking resemblance to the rest of the “P” series Kahr pistols, but with much smaller dimensions. The gun is comparable in size to the very popular Kel-Tec P-3AT and Ruger LCP. The P380 is a striker fired, double action only, locked breech pistol with polymer frame and stainless steel slide. The trigger is partially cocked by operation of the slide, in a manner similar to the Clock “Safe Action” system. The result is a double-action trigger pull that is long and heavy enough to prevent an accidental discharge, while still being very smooth and easy to manage.

This pistol is quite easy to handle and manipulate, despite its small size. The external controls are limited to a magazine release and slide release. The magazine release is a button-style located in the preferred location, just below the trigger guard on the left side of the grip. The slide release lever is also in the traditional location, and locks the slide open on an empty magazine—an uncommon feature on a pocket pistol.

Like many guns in this category, the P380 has a magazine capacity of six rounds. The pistol feeds from high quality stainless steel magazines with witness holes for each round. The magazines are expensive, but Kahr includes two magazines with each pistol. Kahr also offers a Pearce grip extension for the magazines to add a little extra grip length if desired.

Perhaps the best feature of this gun is the sights. The vast majority of pocket guns have minimal fixed sights milled into the top of the slide. The P380, however, has true sights fit to the slide. The sights have a white “bar-dot” configuration and are drift-adjustable. Night sights are available as an option from the factory. The standard Kahr factory sights provide an excellent sight picture rarely seen on a gun this size."
