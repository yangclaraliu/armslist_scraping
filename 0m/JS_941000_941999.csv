The gun features one unified ""control lever"" that disengages the slide stop with the first operation and decocks the hammer with the second. This control lever is mirrored on BOTH sides of the gun, as is the magazine release and the manual slide stop, making the gun FULLY AMBIDEXTROUS without any modification. It has an adjustable rear sight and an incredibly good DA/SA trigger.

These guns are known for being incredibly accurate and are widely regarded as the best of the ""wonder nines."" This example has extremely tight barrel-to-slide and slide-to-frame fit. 

I am not the original owner of this handgun. It shows little mechanical wear. There is minor cosmetic wear likely from storage (see pics).

My jaw hit the floor.

After reading Senator Dianne Feinstein’s new so-called ""Assault Weapons"" Ban, I can only describe this radical scheme as the effective END of the Second Amendment in America.

... The gun-grabbers are going for broke, doing everything they can to ""cash in"" on the recent tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut.

They’re targeting EVERYTHING -- rifles, shotguns and even handguns -- and every gun owner and gun purchase is to be catalogued and tracked by the federal government.

That’s why it’s absolutely critical you act IMMEDIATELY.

As you’ll see, I’ve enclosed a special Emergency Second Amendment Protection Directive INSISTING your Representative and Senators vote against this radical scheme.

Won’t you please sign it TODAY? There’s no time to waste.

President Obama’s Administration is announcing it will ""push forward quickly"" on gun control -- and Vice President Joe Biden is promising it will be a ""done deal"" in a matter of weeks!



If passed, Feinstein’s Gun Ban would: 
*** Ban the sale, transfer, importation, and manufacturing of 120 specifically named rifles, shotguns and handguns!

*** Ban the sale, transfer, importation and manufacturing of ALL firearms with a detachable magazine and at least one ""military characteristic"" -- which could mean just about anything that makes a gun ""look scary;""

*** Ban the sale, transfer, importation, and manufacturing of magazines holding more than 10 rounds;

*** Force owners of ALL ""grandfathered"" weapons to undergo an intrusive background check and fingerprinting -- treating law-abiding citizens like criminals;

*** Force owners of ALL ""grandfathered"" weapons to federally register their guns after obtaining a permission slip from local law enforcement showing their guns are not in violation of state or local law.

That’s right. If you own a $10 magazine that’s more than 10 rounds, you’ll have to register it with the BATFE in their National Firearms Registry.

The ban on ""transfers"" means you and I can forget about ever handing down one of these guns to our kids and grandkids.

Worse, it could mean widows become instant felons if their husbands owned one of these banned magazines or firearms!



And make no mistake, the gun-grabbers’ TRUE motives behind gun registration is always the same -- outright gun CONFISCATION, and to do that they must first register every gun and gun owner.

Then Senator Feinstein will be able to achieve her publicly stated goal:

""Mr. and Mrs. America, turn ‘em all in.""

I can hardly even think about what a DISASTER for our country it would be should President Obama, Senator Feinstein and their anti-gun pals succeed in ramming this monstrosity down our throats.

This is exactly the WRONG move for our country -- for our liberties and for our safety.

Now I know THAT’S something you’re not hearing from the anti-gun propagandists in the national media.

But the truth is, increasing gun sales in America in recent years has led to lower crime rates.

The same is true all over the world.

Studies show countries with low rates of civilian firearms ownership are the most violent. Countries with high rates of civilian firearms ownership are the safest.

Just look to nearby Mexico if you want to see an example of the gun-grabbers’ idea of utopia. Effectively ruled by violent drug gangs in many areas, Mexico is a cesspool of rape, violence and murder.

If you and I want to keep the Second Amendment freedoms we’re so blessed to enjoy as American citizens, it’s absolutely CRITICAL you and I act IMMEDIATELY.

That’s why I’ve agreed to help the National Association for Gun Rights fight back to stop this Gun Ban and help lead the fight AGAINST the gun-grabbers.

They’re tough. They’re principled. And they know how to win.

They know the ONLY way you and I win this fight is if my colleagues here in Congress understand that voting for gun control will mean the END of their political careers . . .

And they’re busy mobilizing pro-gun Americans all over the country to make sure Congress gets that message loud and clear.

Won’t you please sign it TODAY?



But with President Obama, Sarah Brady and all the gun-grabbers doubling down, there’s not much time.

To defeat this radical scheme, the National Association for Gun Rights is going to have to pull out all the stops to alert and mobilize Second Amendment supporters all over the country.

Direct mail. Phones. Email. Blogs. Guest editorials. Press conferences. Hard-hitting internet, newspaper, radio and even TV ads if funding permits. The whole nine yards.

Of course, a program of this scale is only possible if the National Association for Gun Rights can raise the money.

But that’s not easy, and we may not have much time.

In fact, if gun owners are going to defeat Feinstein's Gun Ban, pro-gun Americans like you and me have to get involved NOW!

So please put yourself on record AGAINST the Feinstein's Gun Ban by signing NAGR’s Emergency Second Amendment Protection Directive.

But along with your signed Directive, please agree to make a generous contribution of $250, $100, $50 or even just $35.

And every dollar counts in this fight so even if you can only chip in $10 or $20, it will make a difference.

Thank you in advance for your time and money devoted to defending our Second Amendment rights.

For Freedom,

Rand Paul
United States Senator

I do have additional magazines and ammunition if needed to help balance trade values.

This is not a bone stock, ragged out, or cheap AR-15. It is a full Spikes rig with all necessary options and has been fully sighted in. I just have two and while I do not need to sell, thought I would see what is out there. Needless to say the rifle alone cost $1200, the scope $400, the flip-up $100, and all the added accessories another $200. However, as we all know Spikes is about 1 year behind on orders and similar rigs are going for $2000 to $2500. I am NOT looking to rip anyone off, I would just like to add some new toys to my arsenal and do not need so many AR's.

I really don't need the money and I am looking a full or partial trade.  I HAVE DECIDED THAT ONLY FULL VALUE CASH OFFERS ARE CONSIDERED AND I WILL SALE FOR FULL PRICE WITHOUT TRADES. A full trade would obviously require several guns on your part. I am willing to trade current value for current value. NO BS.
Email me and I will consider what you have. Face-to-face and full trade and sale certificate required. 

Just look around here, on other sights and at dealers. Stripped Spikes are going for $1500 plus with nothing included. People are requesting over $1200 - 1750 for bare DPMS and Bushmasters are between $2000 and $4000. Let’s be honest, this is a really fair deal."

The quality of the wood is exceptional, as the pictures show. Said double rifle is a 300 H&H conversion made by the famous gunsmith B. Searcy. (See last photo for Searcy inscription.) The double barrel length is 24 inches. Also included is a Ruger 26-inch 20-gauge O/U barrel set (skeet/skeet), a Leupold 1x4 variable scope and a spare butt stock (also mint), which was taken off simply to replace it with a highly figured stock. (All items shown in the pictures are included.) The entire double rifle and scope weighs 9.8 pounds. (If the successful bidder would prefer to have a 20-gauge shotgun barrel set with factory removable factory chokes, I have a set in excellent condition that will fit for $150 extra.) The condition of all (metal, wood and scope) is nothing less than mint. No cracks, scratches or dings on anything. As is shown in the 10th photo, there are two different ejectors styles on the rifle barrel set. The original Ruger grip caps (both butt stocks)are not present, as the pictures show. Concerning regulation. I have not done a lot or experimentation, but I have reloaded with 180-grain bullets and 65 grains of IMR 4350. At 50 yards, the lower barrel formed 1.5-inch clusters at 11:00 (11 o'clock) and the upper barrel shot 1.5-inch clusters at 5:00. The center-to-center spread was 4.5 inches. Better groupings can undoubtedly be obtained with additional experimentation. (One might even end up shooting different loads in the two barrels to really close the spread.) Most all double rifles require such a trial-and-error process to reach optimum accuracy. Check out the price Searcy is currently charging for double barrel sets. Over two years ago, they were charging in excess of $4000. ALSO, THE SHOTGUN, BY ITSELF, IS WORTH $1000 IN THIS CONDITION. The gun has never been in the field. It has always been stored in a padded case. Wood is above average in terms of figure, but not outstanding, as the photos show."

Olympic Arms AR 15 Carbine w/37mm Launcher

Good condition, looking for some extra cash. I would consider a partial trade for a subcompact pistol (up to $400) or a pump-action tactical shotgun (up to $500). 

It has a 37mm Havoc launcher ($340) attached to the aluminum free float hand guard ($140), but the launcher is easy to take off when you don't want it on. I've put in a flat hairline trigger assembly ($160), as well as other extras (NcStar 4x scope, rubber handgrip, single point sling and adapter ($60), extra mag pouch, dual magazine clamp, tactical latch pull, vertical grip). It probably only has two or three hundred rounds through it, it's never been rapid fired, and it's been oiled & stored properly in a gun cabinet. 

I also have (10) 30-round magazines (~$150) and about 500 rounds of .223 ammo (~$300). Ideally, I'd like to sell everything together, but I'd be open to splitting it up if you just want the rifle. I've already had a lot of interest for just the launcher or just the ammo, but at this point, I plan on selling everything as one lot. 

If you're looking for just a 37mm launcher, please don't email me about buying just the launcher. You can visit this site and buy one new:

I think this is very fairly priced, but feel free to make me an offer if you don't think so. I'm available to meet most days if you're interested in looking at it. Thanks, Ryan"

[Information added ]
I've seen many rifles up for sale here. One thing I need to say about these rifles is they were built for a purpose which is no longer valid, so instead of them gathering dust they need someone who can appreciate them. So if accuracy is what you are looking for with Long Range or CQB in mind then all I have to say is that both these rifles will exceed your expectations. The 308 is a tack driver at 500 yards (no experience necessary) and can be shot all day long without damage to your shoulder. The 5.56 was built for a lefty to an exceptional standard geared towards close quarter combat, at under 6 lbs can be carried all day with comfort. Any way you look at it you can't get better whether what you're looking for begins with SASS or LMT or POF or whatever brand you may think works best. These were built to perform to the highest standards for 1. Long Range Accuracy and 2. Close Quarters Combat. All .308 magazines are 20 rounds and 5.56 are 30 rounds"

First you will receive a pre-ban Bushmaster XM15 E2S A2 AR15 Lower and pre-ban Bushmaster 20” barreled upper receiver. This has a heavy barrel/chrome lined for accuracy and durability. The longer barrel is great for coyotes or other small animals at long distance. The A2 upper also has a removable scope rail for optics. A picture of the markings on the 20"" barrel are below. You also will receive a Bushmaster heavy barrel/chrome lined A2 16” barreled upper and three position collapsible stock which easily converts your longer barreled hunting rifle to a short personal defense rifle. With practice you can switch the upper receiver bolt carrier group, charging handle and stock in 20 minutes. The 16"" upper does not have a bolt carrier group or charging handle. With this package you also receive an Assault Systems case to carry your rifle. This package also includes two 20 round Adventure Line metal magazines. Neither of the uppers/barrels has many rounds through them. I bought the 16"" upper as the original complete rifle from Bushmaster and bought the 20"" upper directly from Bushmaster for less noise to hunt coyotes. I have owned them since round one and they were broken in slowly and correctly. The 16"" barrel has less than 150 rounds through it and the 20"" barrel has less than 60 rounds through it. The case and full rifle will be shipped to your FFL, but the 16” upper/barrel and stock can be sent directly to you for $45 shipping for all."

I bought it used and have put about 400 rounds of trap loads through it without any problems. Holds 4+1. Comes with full and modified choke. Has a Birchwood-Casey hull catcher on it so the guy next to you doesn't get empties flying at him. (Can be flipped down to allow un-blocked ejection, or easily removed with a hair dryer). Has a 28"" ribbed barrel. They make shorter home defense barrels and smoothbore slug barrels with rifle sights on them, as well as magazine extensions and other accessories if you're looking to make a budget tacticool semiauto.

I'm only interested in firearm-related trades. If you've got a gun you're interested in trading, let me know. The worst I can do is say no thanks. I'm interested in mainly acquiring a rifle of some sort in a relatively common caliber (.223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308, 30-06, 30-30, or even any pistol caliber). Interested in bolt and lever guns as well as semiautos, the only requirement is that the gun has iron sights, or would be capable of having them installed relatively easily (no machining/drilling and tapping required)."

I would consider this gun in almost new condition. I bought it used this winter and havent fired it yet. I also bought an extra 13 round mag ($40 cost). Comes with everything that it came with. THe holser looks as like it has been used. 

Like I said, looking for a 44 Mag or possibly a 41 Mag revolver. I prefer 44 Mag over the 41. Would rather have double action over single action unless its the Hunter Model. The only Taurus 44 Mag I will consider is the Raging Bull. I can add cash depending on your offer. Cash offers will be ignored for now unless I find a revolver I want at a retailer. Face to face No shipping. PTP/PTC required. I show you mine, I see yours. You must be willing to meet me half way between you and me and would like to keep it with 45 minuets of Mankato.

When you reply please send pics of your trade. I would request them anyway, so it will speed the process up if they were included. Also include if you have any extras (i.e. brass, ammo, reloading components etc.)... Depending on your trade, I may also include some Hornady TAP 230 grain +P 

Lets get one thing out of the way. I do not want any electronics, hi points, tires, ipads, tablets,and most definatley, I do not want any AR Mags that you paid $25  for a couple of weeks ago and think that I would be willing to give you 3-4x that much per mag.  Same goes for reloading components.  $75-100 for primers I can go buy for $35.  And just because some things maybe hard to find because a bunch of people went out and bought everything iso they can to sell it for double, I wont be givin you $750 for a Glock"

Bcg and charging handle included. I would prefer a short barrel upper, or a 20""+ that is just what I am after right now. If you have a short barrel upper in 9mm you have what I want most. I would consider uppers without the above mentioned parts, but with bcgs going for 350+ you should price your upper accordingly. I wont complain when you contact me with inflated prices like others will, but if we talk a trade don't complain about my inflated prices either. I am willing to pay cash, trade, or do a partial trade. 
For trade I have a complete lower, mags up to 60 rounds, and a slidefire stock. I have other things, just tell me what your looking for when you contact me about your upper so I am not typing all night.

It is a vintage model 19 Smith and Wesson that was worked on by one of the top p;istol smiths in the country, Hamiltom Bowen. It started off as a 6” barrel and Hamilton cut it down to 2 3/4”, re crown and re-blue. Next we addressed the horrible sights and replaced the front sight with a tritium sight and replaced the rear sight with a black tactical sight. Finally, I had Bowen do a complete action job and the results were amazing! It is the best double/single action trigger on a revolver I have ever felt. It is in good condition with only 100 rounds shot since the work was done. I also have receipts for the work. Own a great custom pistol without the wait! Please see end of post for trade options.

The rifle is ceracoated two tone with OD green on the barrel and FDE on the stock. I have shot a total of 40 rounds through the gun so its barely broken in. It is in good condition with just a couple small handling marks on the barrel. The price is basically just what the components cost and doesn’t include the labor."

I just bought a 2013 Chevy Silverado and had a lift kit and new wheels & tires installed.  The stock wheels & tires are now sitting in my garage collecting dust, so this is your oppertunity to get a great deal and not pay retail price!!!   The wheels & tires are stock Chevy 18"" 5 Spoke Machined Silver w/ Goodyear Wrangler P265/65R18 112T.  This package is brand new with only 18 miles on them!!!!  If you bought these from the dealership they would cost you approx. $2,100 without installation.  You might be able to find them online for around $1,700.  Will fit any 2007 - Present: Avalanche, Tahoe, Silverado, Sierra, Suburban.    I'm asking $1,400 or OBO....
