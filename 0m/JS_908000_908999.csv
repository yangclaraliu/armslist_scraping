The Savage Model 1907 is a semi-automatic pocket pistol produced by the Savage Arms Company of Utica, New York, from 1907 until 1920 in .32 ACP and from 1913 until 1920 in .380 ACP caliber. Although smaller in size, it is derived from the .45 semi-automatic pistol Savage submitted to the 1906-1911 US Army trials to choose a new semi-automatic sidearm. After several years of testing the Savage pistol was one of two finalists but ultimately lost to the Colt entry, which became famous as the Colt Model 1911. 181 of these .45 ACP pistols were returned to Savage after the testing and sold on the civilian market.[1]

The Model 1907 is often erroneously called a Model 1905 because of the date Nov. 21, 1905 date stamped into the top of the slide on all Savage semi-automatic pistols. This is the date Elbert Searle was awarded one of his firearm patents, which were the design basis for all the Savage semi-automatic pistols.

Advertised with the slogan ""Ten shots quick!"", the Model 1907 was very popular because, despite its small size, it had a 10 round double-stack magazine. A safety lever is located on the left side of the pistol, at the upper rear of the grip. Though it appears to have an external hammer, it is actually a striker-fired gun; the ""hammer"" is actually a cocking lever. Model 1907s made from 1913 until 1917 had a collared barrel and a loaded chamber indicator, allowing the shooter to tell by touching the shell ejection port whether a cartridge was chambered. The Model 1907 uses no screws (even the grips snap into place) and is simple to strip. The grips were made from gutta-percha, though some early production examples had metal grips. In 1912 the Model 1907 underwent a major design revision modifying almost every major component.

As with most semi-automatics, the pistol is readied for firing by pulling back and releasing the slide, which inserts a cartridge into the chamber and cocks the pistol. The recoil from firing a cartridge automatically extracts and ejects the empty shell, cocks the firing pin and loads another cartridge into the chamber, ready for firing.

Although the Model 1907 was designed for civilian use, the French government purchased over 40,000 .32 ACP Model 1907s between late 1914 and 1917 for the French military in World War I. These military ""contract"" pistols are recognized by the presence of a loaded chamber indicator and a lanyard ring, or mounting holes in the grip for a lanyard ring; lanyard rings were not available on civilian pistols. The Savage Model 1907 pictured to the right is a French contract pistol. A much smaller contract of 1,150 pistols in the same configuration were purchased by Portugal, which are distinguished by grips bearing the lesser arms of Portugal instead of the standard Indian head.

Savage made two other very similar semi-automatic pistols, with many parts in common with the Model 1907. The first was the hammerless Model 1915; the .32 Model 1915 was made only in 1915 and 1916 and the .380 model from 1915 until 1917. Like the Model 1907, the Model 1915 uses no screws. The other is the Model 1917, made from 1920 until 1926 in .32 and from 1920 until 1928 in .380. The Model 1917 is mechanically the same as and shares almost all of its parts with the final version of the Model 1907 (including a smaller, thinner cocking lever ""hammer""), but with a significantly larger handle. Because this required larger grips, the Model 1917 uses one screw through each grip to hold them to the pistol frame.

Would it not be cheaper to sit down and write your representative a letter than to spend  4 times the money on stuff that still costs the same to make? By overpaying, you feed directly into this screwed up consumer panic scenario. Most local gun stores have an outline or model letter for you to use as an example to write to your local rep. The people paying 3000.00 for a 700.00 rifle are the ones who are allowing this to happen. And to those of you who are selling your Olympic Arms rifles for 3000.00 should think of an acronym, IRS. Be politically active. Stand your ground, keep your rights, and shame on those who take such advantage of people by dumping your crap rifles on others in the name of a ban that isn't even a sure thing. History repeats itself. This happened last time around. They can't do it overnight. Who knows what will happen? 50,000 to 100,000 AR-15 type rifles are pumped into American homes monthly. Too many to go around. Don""t believe the hype!!!! Write a letter!!!!!if you pay it, they will continue to charge insulting prices."

I'm also including these 10 left over rounds if you buy all four mags.

The best two words to describe our AK 30rd magazine: ""rugged"" and ""reliable."" The reinforced composite material prevents corrosion while the heavy duty spring and anti-tilt follower ensure that every round will feed perfectly. Fits in the AK-47 using 7.62 x 39mm ammunition. When your Kalashnikov is thirsting for a magazine that can handle a beating, no questions asked, the INTRAFUSE® 30rd AK Magazine is the only logical choice."

Regrettfully I am selling my last and final prized CZ 75 Pre-B Model 9mm. There are so many fantastic things to say about this gun. Let me be brief. Its an authentic unmodified CZ 75 pre-b. Nothing has been done to it except grips changed and i DO have the original oem CZ grips to go with. Its a rare gun. It even has the original factory box in good shape which ones this old seldom do. It is SUPER ACCURATE! It has a VERY low serial number. in the low 4 digit range. The box is even serialized to the gun! If you dont already know the ""Pre-B"" CZ 75 were amazing because unlike the ""B"" model that followed they have no firing pin block which means fewer moving pieces to break and a MUCH nicer trigger pull with a crispy firing. They also have a much slimmer slide profile and and rounded trigger guard unlike all the CZ 75 models that followed. This one is in great shape. It does have some leading edge wear at the very front of the slide and the very back from being holstered as you can see in the pics. But the overall black polycoat is in very nice shape. No dings. Mechanically, on the inside and as for the bore, its in excellent+ condition. It clearly was fired very little. The only minor thing with the Pre-B models is the sights are small and a bit slow to acquire. So I swapped the rear sight for the larger dot sight from a later CZ 75B, but i do have the correct original rear sight and it is included. The gun is wearing an $80 set of VZ ""frag"" black G10 grips that slim the gun down a lot. They feel great. But I do have the original OEM factory CZ grips and they are included. The original CZ brush is included as well as a Fobus dual Mag holster. Also a new box of 124 grain JHP Remington Golden Sabre is also included! And an extra new soft case is included. So you have about $700-$800 worth of stuff here. And I'm selling it only for cash and VERY firm on the price. This is a straight up steal no matter how you slice it. No gauging here for the high cap mags or rare piece. So you can have it one of two ways....as is, with EVERYTHING you see in the pics for $600 or you can have it all minus the golden sabres, mag holster and VZ grips for $500. Your choice. No haggling. FIRM!
Thanks for looking!

It come with the holster that looks old as well. The pistol i beleive need a sping and clip on the barrel to make it a shootable gun. Other than that it is fine.

The flash suppressor uses a standard .5 x 28 TPI thread pattern, ensuring compatibility with after-market accessories. The receiver is made of high strength steel with a durable wear-resistant Nitron® finish. The trigger housing is machined from an aircraft grade aluminum alloy forging with a hard-coat anodized finish designed to survive extreme conditions. The pistol comes equipped with a smooth two-stage trigger, ambidextrous safety and is designed to accept standard AR magazines.

The red dot sight is pretty useless on the P556 so I put it on my 522, the original Sig polymer magazine is pure garbage so I shot it with no issues using steel magazines. All the failures to load I have seen were with the factory magazine and I had the same issues with Sig's magazine. Using steel magazines makes this pistol 100% reliable, never ever had any issues using them. It is quite heavy but the weight keeps it from climbing even when shooting one handed.

Bipod stud mounted in quad rail.  Folding forward pistol grip with storage compartment.  Bayonet lug.  Flip up night sights present, but no glow left in tritium tubes.  A new Israeli extractor and extractor spring were installed after purchase.  The serial number starts with GAL and the ejector lug and receiver looks great.  There have been between 350 and 500 rounds fired through the rifle since I purchased it new.  Bore is in fantastic shape.  Shoots brass or steel case ammo.
This rifle is a combination of an AR-15 and an AK-47.  The receiver is milled and the folding stock is very solid and locks up tight, made from steel tubing and a cast aluminum butt section.  This rifle has a chromed gas piston and a right side charging handle, that can be charged with the left hand also as it is vertically oriented.  The rifle is much more accurate than the typical AK-47 type design.  Chrome lined barrel.  The front sight hood is a full circle, so it is easy to line up with the ar style flip 2 size peep rear sights.  There are flip up night sights but the tritium does not glow, the tritium tubes can be replaced if you search online.  
The magazines are all in very good shape and are metal, not plastic.  There are (12) 35 round magazines.  There are (5) 12 round magazines-purchased new (unused).

The truck runs great and even in this weather fires right up. I am going to miss the 42 gallon tank when going up north. Catalytic convert's matrix is falling apart and it is making a rattling noise, also the crank shaft is leaking a little oil, not noticeable when changing the oil every 4k miles. I have been running half synthetic for around 40k miles. The driver side seat is lose, you can see the bolt that is stripped giving it the play. The rear 2 benches leather are both in very good condition. Front seats are showing their age, driver side a bit more of course. About a year ago the lower gasket on the manifold was leaking. I had this fixed and since they had the engine open and apart I got all the maintenance done than. Couple months ago one of the rear axles was leaking, I had this replaced along with brake shoe. Very little rust, the spot you can see in the picture of the rear of the truck is the worst of it. The outside body of the truck does look great, she is a good looking truck!

I have the title in my hand and I am ready to sell. Let me know ASAP first come first serve. I am open to trades/barter. Let me know what you have and I can let you know if we can talk some business.

***Please note: I include a fluffy white puppy that is not included in the sale; it is merely my own little propaganda to make the weapon look less scary to the less educated progressives and liberals; little Saul Alinksy tactic I picked up from the Progressives and Socialists in the White House.

Enhanced triggerguard has a shallow “V” shape that provides extra clearance for a shooter wearing gloves, and eliminates the gap at the rear of the USGI triggerguard that can trap or pinch finger. Smooth, ergonomically contoured surface and rounded edges protect the trigger finger from abrasion and won’t snag on the operator’s glove to impede the speed of target engagement. Replaces factory guard in minutes and requires no permanent alterations to receiver; reinstall original guard any time. Manufactured from high-grade, reinforced polymer that’s lightweight, almost as strong as aluminum, and resistant to heat, cold and moisture. Fits mil-spec AR-15/M16 and clones."

I would like to make a trade on some hard to find weapons with anyone having trouble getting into an AR.  This is a NWB (new with box) weapon that I placed in the safe.  I say ""with box"" because the box is in storage an hour away and will have to go pick it up.  I'm going to assume it has a magazine in it; I can't remember but will supply a new 30rd mag if it doesn't have the Pmag in the box.  I had two of these and can't remember if this one had a mag in the box.

I'm interested in trading on either a Desert Eagle or Ruger 1911.

Also interested in trading on a LRB or Springfield M1A or a Savage BA 110 in 300 WM.

I fully understand that some money will have to change hands one way or the other depending on the trade.  I'm not looking to capitalize on this current market big time.  I just recently offended some really great guys over this issue cause they assumed I was out to take advantage.  Just looking for a fair trade under the current conditions.

I do want to be up front.  I bought this one from Buds Gunshop.com and hidden in the small print, it was a CA compliant with a bullet button.  This was a 5 minute $10 fix to change the magazine release and has been legally completed.  So, this serial number (if you call Smith/Wesson) is a CA compliant rifle, however is legal as altered; just know your State's laws.  It doesn't have any other CA, NY, etc. compliant features.

Please send a photo if you email me and describe your trade well.  Feel free to send other items, however don't be offended if I'm not interested.  No harm in trying.

At the time, this was Para Ordnance's hi-cap race gun. The sites were designed for competition shooting - an all-black rear blade site. I had a  company in Texas add three white tritium lines to the rear site to outline the opening and painted a dot on the front so I could hit something. Really didn't use it that much.
