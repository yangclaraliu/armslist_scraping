I am a new gun dealer in GJ, trying to get started as a FFL dealer for the Grand Valley.  I maintain a slim inventory, but can order guns via a network of wholesalers.  I believe that you can try out the guns you are interested in in a big box store, then come and order from me and save yourself a bunch of $$.  I don't have insurance, inventory, payroll, building payment, and all of the overhead that makes guns so expensive from Name Brand Box Stores.
I don't think arming yourself for home/personal protection should break your bank account, and I don't want people to put off buying a gun because you can't afford one.  Check out my website at:  www.therepublicrange.co/ and lets talk about options for getting you a legal gun affordably."

I’ve got this very cool custom Ruger 10/22 up for sale; bought the rifle new in 2010, spent several months finding & ordering all the parts, and finished it about a little over a year ago. It’s only been to the range five or six times and likely has well less than 500 rounds through it. It’s very accurate and never had a problem with it no matter what ammo I used, but I have other projects going and could use the money to finish those. Below is a list of everything that’s been done/comes with it along with about what they cost new;

Ruger 10/22 Carbine (have original receipt) = $200

Fajen Legacy Series Adjustable Stock = $125

Green Mountain 18” .920 bull fluted match chamber target Barrel = $125

BSA 4 to 16 x 40mm Mil-Dot Scope (MD416x40IR with box & papers) = $125

Volquartsen 10/22 Forward Blow Stabilization Module = $95

Volquartsen 10/22 Scope Mount (extended Picatinney rail) = $50

Superior Concepts CNC Charging Handle = $45

Butler Creek (I think) 9”x13” Bipod = $35

Alangator Tri-Mag adapters (x5) @ $10 each = $50

Ruger factory mags (x15) @ $13 each = $195

NC Star 42” rifle case = $35

Asking $750 or best offer, but don’t hesitate to make a reasonable cash offer and I may consider partial trades for other guns; a S&W Governor, an OD Green G27 or G33, a Kel-tec SU-16 (Charlie model only), or maybe a 870 Express Tactical Model #81198. I would prefer face to face in Albuquerque, but will ship to your FFL too (money order plus S&H). Call, text, or email is fine, thanks! Five-oh-five 712 five-one-three-four

PS Since I'm not stupid and I know you can't buy this for much less than TWICE what I'm asking, don't waste my time with any low-ball baloney.... If YOU wouldn't take the offer, don't expect ME too."

Color:  Black

Capacity:  30rd

NO SIGHTS MODEL

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, v5-300 AAC Blackout comes in two different configurations no sights or fixed front/rear sights.

The 300 BlackOut is designed to be shot suppressed and un-surpressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions.  The testing of the Daniel Defense 300 BlackOut firearms indicates that un-surpressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend.  Although, though our extensive testing we did ascertain that the utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-surpressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.

Carved from years of hard-earned insight, the Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. Designed to adapt to a user’s every need, this revolutionary precision rifle offers long-range performance that others can only dream of.

Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it’s not a descendant of anything. This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting.

Thanks to its modular layout, this rifle can be adapted to fit each user’s exact needs. Its straight-line design, running from the muzzle to the shooter’s shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip. This allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a fresh round into the chamber as the bolt silently glides through a polymer guide.


The Model 98B rifle’s aluminum upper receiver boasts an 18-inch M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions.

This impressive long-range weapon isn’t all work. Equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod, it’s also a pleasure to shoot. From its highly efficient muzzle brake to its shooter-adaptable design and unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action.

Interested in trading for a pistol prefer a Sig P226, 229 or 239 in .40 caliber.  I am not interested in the ""RARE WEST GERMAN Models"".  I might consider others just ask...  Not interested in full size Glocks.  XDM would be okay.  My price is cash trade value is set at $700.  This rifle cost just over $800 new and the scope $300.

These were converted during the mid to late 1870s from returns of various military and civilian 1861 Navy revolvers. (Civil War era) the conversion is post-Civil War from 1870s. They can be found in rim-fire (offset firing pin on hammer) or center-fire (centered firing pin on hammer). These were converted from .36 caliber percussion to .38 caliber cartridge; all of these revolvers - conversion or otherwise - retain the original .36 caliber markings. Both .36 and .38 calibers are low pressure black-powder loads and not intended for modern smokeless powder/loads. Of the earliest conversions +/- 2,250 were produced at the Colt factory and 2,000 of them were centerfire and the rest were rimfire. Meaning there should only be around 250 of these around.

What makes this revolver worth the extra is the fact that it was unissued, and manufactured in 1945, the last year of production for nagant revolvers. During ww2 hundreds of thousands were made, but only several thousand in 1945, it was thought that they would be needed against hitler, but the war ended before they could go into service. This revolver is in excellent condition, no finish wear, mirror shiny bore, the trigger pull is much smoother than most of the wartime production nagants. I am also including some surplus ammo 4 boxes are very rare as they are 1988 production (14 rounds in each box) the rest of the ammo was made in 1977. total of 175 rounds. The surplus ammo is not your run of the mill weak nagant ammo such as hotshot, ect, but is decently powerful. with the 77 production running about 1000fps and the 88 running 1300 or so.
I have fired around 200 rounds through this revolver, and it is very accurate as I was able to put strings of 7 into paper plates at 25 yards.
Pictures are available on request.
Absolutely NO trades will be accepted for this revolver - period.

In order to determine value the condition of the firearm has to be known. My guess, though, is that unless it is in very good condition the value is such that it would best be used as a decoration in the den. As you more than likely have read in my previous responses, refrain from shooting the decarbonized steel gun. Same was designed for low pressure loads of black-powder.

It comes with the holster, mag carriers, lock, manuals, paperwork, 2x 5rd mags and 1x 7rd magazine in the XD hard case, everything from the factory..

Like keys to its past you can read the marks and see its life.... very interesting (for me at least.)

Some are worth lots of money this one is not rare though so it is just a fun gun!

This rifle has a new stain on the wood stock and has been modified for a hunting rifle accurate to abt 100 yrds.  I have a basic 7-12 power NC scope mounted and the mount required removal of the rear sight so scope is nearly permanent.

You get a cool rifle and scope for good price.  Large steel bullets that are cheap to buy and easy to put down deer/ game.  If you need a fun cheap hunting gun here you go.

I am soon to be married and hate to part with my first personally purchased shotgun but at the moment cannot afford to buy a handgun. I would prefer smaller framed revolvers of reasonable trade value. Also interested in smaller automatics over .25cal."

799,http://www.armslist.com/posts/524799,For Sale:  IZH Baikal Drozd - FULL Auto BB Gun / Russian made 1200 rounds per minute,"Northeast, Portland, Oregon",$ 250,"Listed On: Sunday, October 14, 2012",Paintball/Airsoft,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For Sale ~ BB Gun Enthusiasts read ~~

As of 10/14/2012 - still for sale.  I've been answering quite a few emails about this gun ~ if you write me please allow me a day to respond back - the emails are lagging for some reason.  I'll answer you back asap.

The IZH Baikal Drozd imported by EAA is an awesome bb machine gun. This gun offers a select fire system like those offered on police and military weapons. One switch controls the rate of fire (ROF) with settings for 1, 3, or 6 round bursts. Meaning that each time you pull the trigger either 1, 3, or 6 bb's are fired simultaneously. The second switch controls how fast those rounds are actually fired as rounds per minute (RPM) with settings for 300, 450, and 600 rounds per minute.

Modified chip to allow full auto @ 1200 rounds per minute (Same as MP5). This means that as long as you hold down the trigger the IZH Drozd will keep firing. Other Drozd accessories include replacing the stock 12g CO2 powerlets with paint ball style tanks for CO2 and high pressure air (HPA). 

Aftermarket Drozd barrel which will increase your muzzle velocity and accuracy.

Comes stock from the factory with a removable and adjustable butt stock as well as a scope mount for accessories such as a red dot scope. The Drozd bb gun is a bb submachine gun, meaning that it is slightly larger than a bb pistol but smaller than a bb rifle. When you first pick it up you realize that the Drozd is not a toy and is indeed a serious piece of hardware for air gun enthusiasts.

Comes with Red/Green Dot Scope - Hi speed loader - HPA hose

I say ""brand new"" because I was the original purchaser of this rifle around 3 or 4 years ago, but I have never used it.  It's never left my safe, except for mounting the scope rings and scope.  It's never been fired, except for pulling the trigger and checking the pull weight with snap-caps inserted.  The trigger pull is right at 3 lbs from the factory.  The rifle was originally sold as a combo package, which I believe went by the combo name of 110FXP3.  Initially, it had a Bushnell scope on it, but I removed it and replaced it with the Nikon.

The scope is also ""brand new"" - bought around the same time but never used except for mounting it to this rifle.  It is a Nikon Buckmaster 3-9x40 scope with Nikoplex reticle and Nikon scope protector.

The manual, etc., for the rifle and box and manual for the scope are included, as seen in the picture.
