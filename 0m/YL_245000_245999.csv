For those not readily familiar with Smith & Wesson variant models, the original Model 42 was introduced in Smith & Wesson Company’s Centennial Year of 1952, a piece whose hammer was fully enclosed and thus would not snag on pocket fabric; and also could not be fired except with a deliberate double action trigger pull. Taurus led the way in the 1980s, producing steel and alloy small frame revolvers that could withstand higher pressure +P loaded .38 Special ammunition, and this one certainly will. It weighs in at a conservative 23 ounces, comfortable handling and more pleasant to shoot. Finish is entirely lustrous Taurus blue steel, with factory Taurus pebble grained combat boot grip; hammer and trigger are traditional color casehardened. All Taurus revolvers have internal transfer bar safety that prevents accidental firing if they are dropped. This one has its patented Taurus hammer lock placed on the back of the frame where the shroud part meets the grip frame, and it comes with two keys. This is at the same time one of the most traditional and most advanced revolvers on the market. Here is what Taurus says about these: Welcome the Taurus CIA, the handgun designed for personal protection. It features a fully enclosed hammer. The .38 CIA functions smoothly in full double action. It features the Taurus Security System built in at no extra charge and carries the Taurus unlimited lifetime repair policy. Unlimited lifetime repair policy included. These aren't easy to come by. Replacement price in our area, if a person can even find one, is well over $400. The Smith & Wesson 642s are $700 apiece or more.

After the flurry of firearms sales died down in 1982, and prices began deflating, Taurus used the lull for innovative purposes. After years of following their Smith & Wesson ancestors, Taurus began taking a leadership role. This Taurus model 85 Ultra-Lite represents Taurus's leadership, and others' following, to use technological advances in steel work and investment casting to bring the Chief's Special class of revolvers to a state of withstanding .38 Special +P proof loads. Smith & Wesson itself lagged for almost 10 years before following suit, and that only under pressure from its Brazilian offspring. This is the lightweight, blue steel frame Model 85 Taurus, product Code 2-850021UL, manufactured in Brazil for Taurus International in Miami. It has an all steel, full lug 2 inch barrel. Capacity, of course, is 5 rounds; fixed notch rear sight and blade front sight atop a matte finished sighting plane for diminished glare; bright blue steel frame; case colored MIM type hammer and trigger. The hammer strikes a floating firing pin, and in addition to the transfer bar internal safety, this revolver comes with Taurus's patented and inconspicuous hammer lock with two keys. Grips are pliable semi-pebbled rubber combat with finger grooves and faint palm swells. At 17.5 ounces, the grips along with the steel frame make for an optimal combination of lightness and maneuverability. Pricing on the standard Model 85 in our area is upwards of $400, if a person can even find one.

For those not readily familiar with Smith & Wesson variant models, the original Model 49 Bodyguard was introduced in 1959, after the popular S&W Centennial enjoyed 7 years of successful marketing; but people still wanted a pocket revolver whose hammer spur would not snag, but that could be fired single action as well as double action. Taurus led the way in the 1980s, producing steel and alloy small frame revolvers that could withstand higher pressure +P loaded .38 Special ammunition, and this one certainly will. It weighs in at a conservative 23 1/2 ounces, comfortable handling and more pleasant to shoot. Finish is attractive and traditional Satin Stainless, with factory Taurus pebble grained combat boot grip; hammer and trigger are traditional satin stainless as well. All Taurus revolvers have internal transfer bar safety that prevents accidental firing if they are dropped. This one has its patented Taurus hammer lock placed on the hammer spur, and it comes with two keys. This is at the same time one of the most traditional and most advanced revolvers on the market. Here is what Taurus says about these: Welcome the Taurus Protector, the handgun designed for personal protection. Protector features a fully shrouded zero profile hammer that can be manually cocked/decocked in single action operation when needed. Protector also functions smoothly in full double action.

For those not readily familiar with Smith & Wesson variant models, the original Model 40 was introduced in Smith & Wesson Company’s Centennial Year of 1952, a piece whose hammer was fully enclosed and thus would not snag on pocket fabric; and also could not be fired except with a deliberate double action trigger pull. Taurus led the way in the 1980s, producing steel and alloy small frame revolvers that could withstand higher pressure +P loaded .38 Special ammunition, and this one certainly will. It weighs in at a conservative 23 ounces, comfortable handling and more pleasant to shoot. Finish is entirely traditional Taurus satin finished stainless steel, with factory Taurus pebble grained combat boot grip; hammer and trigger are traditional satin stainless as well. All Taurus revolvers have internal transfer bar safety that prevents accidental firing if they are dropped. This one has its patented Taurus hammer lock placed on the back of the frame where the shroud part meets the grip frame, and it comes with two keys. This is at the same time one of the most traditional and most advanced revolvers on the market. Here is what Taurus says about these: Welcome the Taurus CIA, the handgun designed for personal protection. It features a fully enclosed hammer. The .38 CIA functions smoothly in full double action. It features the Taurus Security System built in at no extra charge and carries the Taurus unlimited lifetime repair policy. Unlimited lifetime repair policy included. These aren't easy to come by. Replacement price in our area, if a person can even find one, is well over $400. The Smith & Wesson 642s are $700 apiece or more.

*****Also it will come with a Kicks GT 665 turkey choke*****
HERE IS WHAT BENELLI HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT:

A favorite among Benelli shotguns, the Benelli Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.
The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech® system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that’s more than a pound less! The ComforTech® system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest shooting and most reliable shotgun ever."

Taurus has taken Glock's basic design lines and improved upon them, most notably in the area of safeties. This Taurus 24/7 has a positive locking thumb safety for right-handed shooters; more important, it comes with Taurus's patented internal lock system and two keys. The Taurus, furthermore, has smoother lines and smoother surfaces than its competitor, note the beveled top of the frame – nowhere near as Box-y as the Glock. Whereas a person has to get one of the rather unwieldy, fattening Hogue slip-on grips to get a positive control feel to the Austrian Company's products, the Brazilians at Taurus have incorporated a positive-gripping entire critical area of the 24/7's grip frame with mild serrations on the sides and pronounced serrations in the finger grooves. Sighting system is the quick-resolution Heinie Straight-Eight, and both front and rear sights are drift adjustable for windage. This Taurus does not depend upon a slide activated sear in order for the trigger to work as on the Glock; the Taurus's trigger works independently on its own for positive, sure firing in every shot and in every condition. This variant of the 24/7 is what Taurus calls the Long Slide Variant, Government Size 5 inch barrel. Rifling in the Taurus's bore is conventional groove and land, and a person can shoot any type of bullet, steel, lead, or jacketed, without fear of the barrel bursting. Not so with Glock. Equally crucial, too, the Taurus 24/7 comes with two blue steel bodied 12 shot magazines for positive slide stop engagement and quick-reloading free-fall ejection. Highly important in today's economic climate, the Taurus is almost $200 cheaper than its Glock competitors. The Taurus has a double picatinny accessory rail built into its frame, and weighs in at only 27.2 ounces empty. With the service size grip frame and four inch barrel combined with Taurus's superior grip frame structure, this 24/7 will withstand and perform well under sustained fire, even in adverse conditions. Factory product code is 1247451PLS12. Blued  slide has a matte finish in order to prevent glare in daylight conditions. Replacement price on this fine pistol, if a person can even find one, in our area is currently upwards of $500. The Glocks are selling at many stores in our area for upwards of $700. We're offering this one, however, 	for only	$ 379.00.	Not transferable to civilians in Massachusetts.

Taurus began building credible, quality descendants of the Beretta 92 series in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the Brazilian Company deftly combined tradition with innovation beginning with its early models. The 92 and 99 series pistols filled a pricing niche beneath the pricey Berettas with no sacrifice of quality. After Beretta introduced its 92SB Compact, Taurus followed suit with their 92 C, which led to the series that includes the photo specimen in the late 1990s, when Taurus took its Beretta Compact type frame and installed a shorter, sturdier slide with looks akin to the German Sig Pistols. Here is Taurus’s PT-909 Stainless, with a straighter, thinner grip frame on the order of Beretta’s Vertec frames for shooters more comfortable with a pared-down grip frame compared to the relatively fat feeling 92 variants. Type is traditional double and single action semi-automatic; construction is stainless steel barrel, slide and parts mounted on a polished alloy frame; grip frame is traditional and serrated fore and aft. Frame is equipped with an integral Picatinny or Weaver type rail for optical, laser and light accessories. Magazine capacity is 17 rounds, 17+1 total capacity. Barrel length is 4 inches according to published factory specs, but 3 3/4 inches by our own fallible measurement. Weight empty is 30.2 ounces. This pistol comes furnished with two blue steel finger rest floorplate Taurus factory magazines; commonly available Taurus 92 Magazines can easily be modified to fit into this 909; its mag release slots are wider than the regular 92s, but everything else is dimensionally the same on the magazines. Ambidextrous Frame Mounted Safety levers also serve as decockers, to safely return the hammer to its resting, double-action-ready position. The pistol, like all Tauruses with frame mounted safeties, is also capable of cocked-and-locked, single-action-first-shot carry. Current replacement pricing on the PT 909 is upwards of $500 per unit in our area, if a person can even find one. We’re offering the PT-909 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, 	 	for only	$ 389.00.	Not transferable to civilians in California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts.

This M-1600 is manufactured by Armscor of the Philippines, the company that brings us their excellent 1911 pistols that perform so very well. Action type is, of course, blowback semi-auto, and it is a direct descendant of the Remington 550-1 rifles that are still in service after 60 years. Sights are correct aperture rear and post front with authentic carry handle and gas housing replicas. Magazines are 10 round blue steel, housed in a correct-looking and fitting AR-15 type housing. Forend and buttstock are classic Colt SP-1 Vietnam Era styling black ebony stained hardwood with removable vertical pistol grip. The forend configuration allows barrel exposure for better heat dissipation. Shoppers note that the pistol grip installs easily with furnished bolt, same way with the sling. Barrel is 18 1/4 inch blue steel with 1:16 rifling, and receiver is blued steel as well. Weight empty is a well balanced 6 1/2 pounds. We have sold substantial numbers of this brand rifle with good results since the 1970s, when the 550-1 phased out and the Filipino manufacturers filled the gap with a good quality economically priced rifle marketed under the Squibman and K-Mart brands, then Armscor. ARMSCOR uses, writes the factory, only high grade ordnance steel for all major parts for durability and mechanical reliability even in the most adverse operating conditions. Instruction manual and magazine indicates high velocity .22 ammo; our local customers have always had best results with Winchester, Federal, and Aguila coppercoated ammunition.

This AK-22 is manufactured by Armscor of the Philippines, the company that brings us their excellent 1911 pistols that perform so very well. Action type is, of course, blowback semi-auto, and it is a direct descendant of the Remington 550-1 rifles that are still in service after 60 years. Action is not at all Kalashnikov, so this rifle is not proscripted by anti-AK State and Local laws. Sights are correct elevation adjustable square notch rear and hooded blade front with authentic pistol grip and faux gas tube assembly. Magazines are 10 round blue steel, housed in a correct-looking and fitting short curved AK type housing. Forend and buttstock are classic dark stained AK Vietnam Era styling. Barrel is 18 1/4 inch blue steel with 1:16 rifling, and receiver is anodized alloy. Weight empty is a well balanced 7 pounds. Sling is 1 1/2 inch black military style, and it attaches easily to the permanent swivels. We have sold substantial numbers of this brand rifle with good results since the 1970s, when the 550-1 phased out and the Filipino manufacturers filled the gap with a good quality economically priced rifle marketed under the Squibman and K-Mart brands, then Armscor. ARMSCOR uses, writes the factory, only high grade ordnance steel for all major parts for durability and mechanical reliability even in the most adverse operating conditions. Instruction manual and magazine indicates high velocity .22 ammo; our local customers have always had best results with Winchester, Federal, and Aguila coppercoated ammunition.

HERE IS WHAT BENELLI HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT:

A favorite among Benelli shotguns, the Benelli Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.
The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech® system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that’s more than a pound less! The ComforTech® system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest shooting and most reliable shotgun ever."

Barrels are 20 inch Cylinder Bore, wide open, and this shotgun has a tang safety as well as half-cock position for its hammers. We have sold China made Shotguns, Jin An and Norinco, now for over 20 years with excellent service experience, and we commend our Chinese friends on their expertise and workmanship on firearms. We refrain, however, from complimenting their packaging, normally any given one of these shotguns will have some sort of minor cosmetic flaw like the small dimple visible in the photo of the left side of the buttstock near the comb. These factors explain why this shotgun is $300 range, and its Italian competitors twice that much. These fine little shotguns weigh in at a healthy 8 pounds or so. Barrels are 20 inch blue steel, 3 inch chambers, Full Choke Right tube and Modified Left tube. The specimens we have miked gauge at .698 right tube and .685 left tube, definitely not for steel shot loads. Buttstock length of pull including their 3/8 inch thick rubber recoil pad is the standard 14 inches. While these are immensely popular in cowboy action shooting circles, they are also a fearsome weapon in their own right, always have been. In a current market climate where 8-shot Mossbergs are inflating to the $500 range, these are not only an excellent value, they are not only respectable competitors since the first shot, after all, is the most important in any scenario. These are also downright attractive. WWe're offering the one in the photo or one of its identical mates each for only	 $ 289.00.

This fine rifle has a 20  inch Round Carbine length barrel, and it’s chambered chambered in .357 Magnum caliber, interchangeable with .38 Special as well. This well balanced rifle weighs in at only 7 pounds 1 ounce, and its center of gravity is directly centered on the brass shell carrier. Barrel is nicely blued with a hint of purplish hue, marking is Chaparral ~ Repeating Arms / King’s Improvement Patented March 29, 1866, October 16, 1860, in front of the traditional two leaf L aperture and blade rear sight, with the words Cal .357 Mag behind the dovetailed sight base. On the bottom of the receiver beneath the Italicized serial number is Cat. 16170. Upper tang is marked Model 1866. The 10 shot magazine tube, like the barrel, screws, receiver, saddle ring, trigger, buttplate, and lever locking key are blue steel; and the lever and hammer are color casehardened steel. Shell carrier mechanism and ammunition storage plate on the buttplate are solid brass, and the carrier of course mates at the bottom of the receiver. Forend and buttstock are Italian walnut with occasional minimal signs of shelfwear, see the tiny vertical scours on the forend sides in the photos. These rifles have been unpacked and repacked, but never loaded, fired, or transferred; they are in their original boxes with all their papers. Product catalog is dated 2008, the year of import. We only have a handful of them. Chaparral Arms, of course, is an Italian based company with relations to two great companies, Charter Arms and Armi San Marco. This rifle’s barrel is inconspicuously marked by its importer, KBI in Harrisburg, PA on the right side barrel flat next to the forend. The KBI / Charles Daly company is sadly defunct. Box, however, is marked Chaparral Arms. Similar Italian-made rifles from competitors Uberti and Navy Arms command prices upwards of $1000 - $1500 per unit. We have not been able to offer any quality 1866 or Henry type rifles in this price range for many years, not since the 1970s.

http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/p250-compact-digital-camo.aspx

This model is more expensive because it is digital camo and has night sights. The MSRP on it is $855. I know they have some of the other models going for less, but this isn't the plain black. I bought this gun new, I have NOT fired ANY rounds through it. It is still brand new as it came from the factory. The pictures I post are of the actual firearm. The handgun comes with original box, two (2) 15 round magazines, and everything that came in original box.

I will consider all respectable bids. Please do not email me unless you are serious. This is a great pistol, I don't need any more 9mm's which is why I am selling this one. I searched for this pistol, and most of the online company's were out, and I'm not sure Sig is making the Digital Camo version anymore (but I can't verify). FTF only.

Chambered for the .22 Long Rifle, the T-Bolt features a unique straight-pull kind of action where the bolt handle is simply pulled backward to open the action and pushed forward to close it. This is the ""T2"" or Deluxe variation with a lacquer finished hand-checkered walnut stock.   It features a 24"" barrel with ramp front sight and and mounted BALVAR 8B scope.   (The  Bausch & Lomb Balvar 8B is a 2.5x8 Variable rifle scope with fine crosshair & dot reticle; gloss finish; the 8B is a very high quality scope that was manufactured in Japan from about 1968 - 1973.)   This near perfect T-Bolt includes the original 5-shot detachable box magazine. Condition is ABSOLUTELY EXCEPTIONAL, NEAR MINT and the rifle retains 100% or the original blue finish. The stock is in ALMOST FLAWLESS Condition, grading 99.8%, with just a couple of super small handling marks. There are no cracks, chips or repairs.   Special note:   This rifle was manufactured in early 1966, which according to a BROWNING ARMS HISTORIAN actually predates the start of the ""salt wood"" problem years; so there are no worries about hidden rust (nor any evidence of).   The action is smooth and bore excellent.   This superb rifle has been in my family for many years with VERY, VERY minimal use.   Seeking a new home where it will be lovingly used and cared for!!!  (includes original owners manual/instruction booklet)

More Scope Details...(BALVAR 8B) Bausch and Lomb Scopes:
When people hear the name Bausch and Lomb, they typically think contacts and sunglasses, instead of rifle scopes. However, in the mid 1960's, Bausch and Lomb did venture into the sporting optics market and produce a number of rifle scopes.
During WW1 and WW2, the demand for optical based military equipment reached an all-time high for B&L as military products accounted for almost 70% of all the products they sold. Once the wars were over, Bausch and Lomb saw the optics market change so they changed as well.
In 1962, Bausch and Lomb marketed their first series of rifle scopes, called the Balfour. BAL was an abbreviation for Bausch and Lomb and ""four"" was the power of the scope. This scope was a success, which led to the introduction of other B&L models, including a very popular variable model called the Balvar (var meaning variable). Many people commonly think that the scope series was a ""Balvar"" and didn't realize that it was a combination of the abbreviation and the scope settings. Most of the Balvar models were a variable 2.5 to 8 power scopes.
In 1968, Bausch and Lomb released their 2nd generation of scopes known as the ""B"" series. This series was a continuation of the early BAL models with a ""B"" appended to the name such as a Balvar 8B. The ""B"" series did well, leading B&L to release a 3rd generation of scopes known as the Elite 3000 and Elite 4000 series."

Retail on this thing is $500 and I am asking only $350! Description is below.

Features:
Lock-N-Load® Powder Measure
The only system that uses a full size powder measure that can be reset to another charge or powder with the push of a button. The unique inserts can be preset to the charge you use with the caliber you are loading. The most flexible (and economical) powder system available for progressive presses.

Priming System
The primer slide in the shell carrier receives a primer at the top of the stroke and inserts in the case at the bottom of the stroke. The slide stays in perfect alignment, and is easily changed from large to small. Use the included primer pick-up tubes (large and small) to fill the primer tube.

Lock-N-Load® Bushing System
Switch dies from one caliber to another or change out die stations and begin reloading again in seconds. Once set, dies never needs readjusting. Bushing locks standard 7/8""-14 dies rock-solid in perfect alignment.

Case Activated Powder Drop
Get a charge of powder only when a cartridge is in place. Works with any cartridge, pistol to magnum rifle. Can be manually operated to check powder charge. Install the optional Lock-N-Load powder die for the fastest changeover of all progressive presses. Also fits RCBS measurer.

Five-station Die Platform
Five stations allow for all the variables and still let you use your standard dies — most 7/8""-14 dies and 7/8""-14 powder measures will work.

Universal Ejector
Cases are automatically ejected into the included case catcher.

Automatic Indexing
This very important feature automatically advances shells to the next station with the smoothest indexing of any press in this price range, and rotates every half stroke to lessen the chance of powder spillage.

Case Retainer
Quickly and easily remove and/or replace a case from the shell plate at any point in the cycle without extra retaining buttons. Case retainer fits all calibers.

Large Cartridge Catcher
A large capacity catcher comes standard with the Lock-N-Load AP Press. An extra large capacity catcher which holds up to 1/3 more completed cartridges is available as an option.

*Note: Some manufacturers taper crimp dies may interfere with the ejector wire when they are used in station 5. Hornady New Dimension Taper Crimp Dies are designed to work flawlessly in station 5. If you will be using dies other than Hornady, we suggest that you use our powder through expander and install the taper crimp die in the 4th station. Ejector wires are set at the factory and we DO NOT RECOMMEND adjustment."

It is a TriStar Arms. Armslist doesn't have a listing for TriStar but It is compareable to the Remington SPR 453  so I put it under Remington.
I'm selling this TriStar Viper 12 guage semi auto. Its is in very clean and in Very good condition, almost like new, except you can barely see a couple light lines  on the barrel where it looks like it got caught up on a tree limb while walking through the woods. They are so light, they dont even show up in photos.
 I had it out only twice and that was a year ago when I was crow hunting.  At that time I activated the 5 year warranty so It still has  4 years left on the warranty!!
It has a Black synthetic stock, and the finish on the receiver and barrel are black also. It has a modified screw in choke and I believe the chokes are the same as benelli chokes. The barrel length is 28"".
 This shotgun  is made in Turkey and imported by Tristar arms out of Kansas City Mo. Its a great shotgun to take out and shoot without breaking the bank. These shotguns have had great reviews on the internet, which helped me make my decision on purchasing it.
   It is gas operated, and as many gas operated semi auto's, it does not like those junk Walmart shells that are sold in bulk. It shoots quality ammo such as Winchester and Estate target loads just fine. I have almost a full box of shells that go with the gun.
This cost me $349.99 new, plus $25.00 shipping off of  gunbroker.com and a $25.00 FFL fee, so I have exactly $400.00 in it.  I would like to sell it for $275.00 
 Local pickup is preferred, but I am willing to ship it for Cost plus $25.00 shipping and if your state requires shipping from FFL to FFL, then add another $25.00

If you're into military surplus from a certain region, you know exactly what this is. 

This is still ""new in the box"" - I bought it from Aim Surplus several years ago and never actually took 'er out to shoot.  

Back then they were selling for $109 with a $20 ""hand pick"" fee.  I did the hand pick, but I'm not sure it buys you more than the least ugly commie rifle.  In any case, it's certainly better looking than what they're selling now for $129.

I paid $129 plus shipping and sales tax.  So $120 sounds right to me because it's +10% savings - if you want one this makes sense.   (I'm selling three so will make a group deal if you want.)

Has the accessories - belt holder, belt, oiler, tools.

You are looking at a beautiful Left handed Benelli Super Black Eagle II 28 inch barrel - semi auto 12 guage with all the accessories. including shims, chokes etc. and Benelli break down carrying case.

*****Also it will come with a Kicks GT 665 turkey choke*****
HERE IS WHAT BENELLI HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT:

A favorite among Benelli shotguns, the Benelli Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.
The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech® system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that’s more than a pound less! The ComforTech® system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest shooting and most reliable shotgun ever."

I hate that I'm listing this, but it's Christmas time and I need the loot. Up for sale is a Keltec PF9 is LIKE NEW condition. Bought it in June on Father's Day and I've carried it a lot in a Michael Kole leather pancake holster (http://michaelkole.com/) but fired it little. No skin contact, so no tarnishing, corrosion, and it's flawless. For what it's worth this is my favorite micro compact pistol I've owned/fired in a LONG time. 

Here is the link to my Keltec PF9 Review where you can find pictures and the full video on the gun.

Fourteen round (I think it holds) tube feed.  Good looking walnut stock.  Most of the bluing in good shape. 

With Long Rifle bullets chambers first round and fires with no problem, but has trouble feeding subsequent rounds.  They don't enter the chamber, but hit above the chamber.  If you don't shoot it, but just operate the action, the rounds chamber fine and will cycle through the full magazine without trouble.  I then tried some Longs (not Long Rifle).  They don't have enough power to operate the bolt, but will shoot, eject, and chamber the next round just fine if you pull the bolt back.  I guess what I'm saying is as is it works sort of like using a short stroke bolt action.  Would need repairs to operate as semi-auto.

I'm firm on the price at $60.

I have a Mossberg silver reserve over under 12 ga shotgun. I had it sold but my buddy flaked out on me so its back up for sale. The gun has a small nick on the barrel from a rock that got kicked up on a hunting trip. other than that the gun is in excellent condition. I have  three extra chokes that come with the gun.  There is a tool for them also but I am not sure where its at. if I find i t ill mail it to the  buyer.
Stock has been refinished with linseed oil
There are no other accessories or parts for the shotgun. i am selling it  because i want to move to a  different style of shotgun. I have no other reason to sell it than to buy another  shotgun.
Please make reasonable offer.

I will trade the shotgun for a semi auto 12 ga with wood stock ONLY or Cammo pattern synthetic. NO black plastic stocks.. Not looking for anything that has been beat up. if yours is that  much  more expensive I will come up with cash as long as you are realistic about the  worth of your  gun but prefer a  straight swap. i do prefer to sell outright. makes it easier for me."

Gun is like new in box (FYI: As with all new Scorpion pistols, the bluing on the gun shows slight wear on the bolt and where the charging lever contacts the receiver. According to CZ USA and as stated in the operators manual this is how they come from the factory Mas they are test fired and sighted in prior to importation which creates this normal wear the first time the bolt is cycled.) 

I am also including a bring-back war souvenir from the First Gulf War as an added collector's bonus. It is an Iraqi made leather shoulder holster rig for a Skorpion. It is somewhat crudely made and is stamped with a encircled star with Arabic in the middle and was made in a shop that used to be located on Al Rasheed St. in downtown Baghdad. Probably belonged to a member of the Republican Guard and was likely recovered from the desert when they fled leaving behind their gear during Operation Desert Storm. I acquired it in a bulk lot of Gulf War Era mil-surp junk from a local guy. While made for one, it isn't fitted to the Skorpion and isn't very functional or practical, but is a nifty historical artifact. You would have to oil it up and condition it properly to get the gun to fit in it.

http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/p250-compact-digital-camo.aspx

This model is more expensive because it is digital camo and has night sights. The MSRP on it is $855. I know they have some of the other models going for less, but this isn't the plain black. I bought this gun new, I have NOT fired ANY rounds through it. It is still brand new as it came from the factory. The pictures I post are of the actual firearm. The handgun comes with original box, two (2) 15 round magazines, and everything that came in original box.

I will consider all respectable bids. Please do not email me unless you are serious. This is a great pistol, I don't need any more 9mm's which is why I am selling this one. I searched for this pistol, and most of the online company's were out, and I'm not sure Sig is making the Digital Camo version anymore (but I can't verify). FTF only.

Hello, I am selling my Smith and Wesson M&P Pro Series handgun, chambered in 40 S&W. The Pro models are hard to find (try the local shops and see how you do) and feature a factory upgraded trigger and factory night sights.

This is the standard full size slide and barrel (4.25 inches) and is great for carry.

I also have a 40 to 9mm conversion barrel made by Storm Lake (the best company for M&P conversion barrels) that I purchased to train with, so you can shoot both 40 and 9mm with this gun.

All M&P handguns feature:

-Three interchangeable backstraps to fit any hand which you can swap without tools in under ten seconds. 

- Fully ambidextrous controls, with a slide stop on both sides of the frame and a magazine release that can be swapped for right or left handed shooters.

-Lightweight Polymer Frame

-Stainless Steel Slide, coated in Melonite (very hard)

This Pro Series Model adds:

-4 1/2 pound trigger pull

-Factory Night Sights (Trijicon)

-4.25 inch barrel (standard length barrel, great for carry)

-Magazine Capacity of 15 rounds (40 S&W) and 17 rounds (9mm)

Regular M&P .40 models (without night sights) retail for $530 at Cabelas, you can purchase a factory upgraded gun here (with night sights) at a better price (without taxes) and get a whole package to run TWO calibers.

This model has an MSRP of near $700.

I am selling because I’m moving away from polymer frames. They work reliably and weigh less for carry, but I just shoot my DA/SA metal frames better.

I am offering my Pro model as a package (M&P Pro .40, Two .40 magazines, Storm Lake 40 to 9mm barrel, One 9mm Magazine) for $650 obo.

I also will sell the M&P Pro as it came from Smith and Wesson (M&P Pro .40, Two .40 Magazines) for $550 obo.

The only trade I will entertain is for a Gen 4 Glock 19 with Night Sights (or cash to compensate for no night sights) because my father is interested in one.

Missouri Residents only, will need to make a copy of your license for my records, no one barred from owning a firearm need apply.

Great shooter, accurate and manageable recoil control.  Perfect for a CCW piece. Nothing at all wrong with this pistol, I just don't have any other 45's and I acquired this in a trade and don't want to buy another caliber ammo.

It does come with all my remaining 45acp ammo - 47 rounds of 230grn FMJ target ammo.
