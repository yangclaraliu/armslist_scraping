The Ruger® LCR (Lightweight Compact Revolver) w/Crimson Trace® Lasergrip® 
This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. 
Features: 
** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish. 
** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. 
** Crimson Trace® Lasergrip® offers the advantages of a laser sighting system.

It's a great rifle that I bought while stationed in Colorado for prairie dogs but now that I'm back here it just sits in the safe. Rifle has been through proper barrel break-in procedure, scope has proper reticle-to-bore alignment, and has been stored in dehumidified safe. No scratches on rifle or stock. Scope is a 16X fixed Mil-dot reticle. Bore has round count of 105 exactly. The XR-100 is fitted with a Model 40-XB target trigger. It is adjustable for pull weights from 1 1/2 - 3 1/2 lbs and features a varmint contour 26"" barrel configuration. Its action is fitted to a laminated thumbhole stock with beavertail forend with lightning vent cuts under the barrel channel for better heat dissipation. Feel free to contact me with any questions or if you would like any other pics. I am not separating anything, no shipping, deal is FTF. (CLICK LINK BELOW TO SEE PICTURES). Decided on some trades, tactical setup preferred. If it's an AR then I would really like it with a gas piston. Already have AK's and a Socom 16 so looking for .223/5.56.

Also known as the ""arm pistol"" or ""survival gun"". This gun was made by Gwynn Firearms, who ended up being Bushmaster. There were 3 variants of this weapon, this one is the 2nd variation. Most like this one the most because the safety is in the trigger guard, so you can actuate it and still have your finger on the trigger. This version also has the milled receiver.(early ones were stamped) One of the coolest features of this weapon is the fact that it uses AK style gas piston impingement system which is all the rage now. It uses the same bolt, trigger parts, mag release, and magazines as the AR. A unique feature of this weapon is the pistol grip-trigger assembly rotates side to side.(see pic) This weapon is also unique in the fact that you get a collector piece, and an ultra modern firearm in one piece. I am a machinist, so I machined an AR quad rail to fit, added a vertical grip, and a buttstock. It is an 11.5"" barrel with permanently attached 4.5' suppressor, and is 25"" overall in length. All updates are mounted as to not affect the original condition of this weapon. Simply remove a few bolts, and it is back to original collector condition. Thanks for looking"

Up for sale is one of my rifles I've owned for the past 14 years, fired annually if that, and kept in good operating condition over those many years.  It fires flawlessly.  Transactions will occur legally IAW state, federal, and local laws.  Will only ship to FFL licensed persons via USPS for out of area transactions.  Prefer face to face transaction at local firing range to ensure satisfaction of operation and condition.  Hi-res photos provided as requested.  No signs of rust on the rifle that I can see, but age shows with a less polished appearance.  If you're looking for hangar queens, goto Big 5.

Yes this gun is brand new. Just a light greasing/oiling and stored. Originally was waiting for a nice day to shoot it; now with the nice days finally here I just don't have the enthusiasm to get the Ruger out and use it. I started this project to make a fun toy to go shooting with that had the tactical feel of a more expensive rifle. This certainly reached that pinnacle but I've grown bored of it and wish to move onto a different project. I had intended to put a bull barrel on the gun but since storing it interest has tapered off into a different direction.

I know some of you may be thinking that $500 is a bit steep for a Ruger 10/22. This is no plain-jane Ruger 10/22. Lets add up all the modifications + extras that are included with this sale..

Ruger 10/22 - $300~ with taxes, misc. fees included (Big5 Sporting Goods)
Marauder G36 Stock - 153.99 with shipping (CheaperthenDirt.com)
Power Custom Hammer - $45.94 with shipping (Brownells.com)
Ruger BX-25 (X3) - $93.25 with shipping (Brownells.com)
500 rounds of .22LR - $25 (Local)
For a grand total of: $618.18
Now I'm selling the gun for $500.00

That's a difference of $118.18! That's $120 dollars I've spent that has been put back into your pocket. I would say that's a great deal!

EDIT: The MAGPUL AFG and Red-Dot sight are not included with the sale"

I know this auction may offend some of the purists out there but this particular rifle has had no historical connection that has in any way, shape, or form made it more rare then the millions of other Mosin Nagant 91/30s out there. So I feel no shame in having sporterized this particular rifle. The gun has had less then 100 rounds through it and has performed flawlessly. Russian engineering at it's best.

Modifications include:
Monte Carlo stock (barrel has been free-floated)
The barrel was cut to 20"" and recrown at 11degrees.
Finnish ball-roller M38 trigger was installed
Sear Spacer
Trigger Return Spring
Custom turn-down bolt-handle (sniper style)
Wolff Hi-Pressure Spring
S&K Scope Mount (utilizes original mount)
AIMPOINT Long-Eye Relief Scope (cheap)
Bolt has been polished for a smoother action

Extras include:
.50 cal can full of 54R (approx. 400+ rounds)

The gun has been partially duracoated a semi-gloss/matte black. The reason I say partially is because I had originally not intended to duracoat the Mosin but found that after painting another project I had some left over. Mid-way through the process I ran out of duracoat. There are two areas that are partially painted and the rest has only had one layer applied. You can easily strip the gun down and duracoat the remainder with a $30 dollar Mix-n-Spray kit available from Brownells. Shouldn't affect the durability of the duracoat at all."

Last year the trans went out and I had it rebuilt by a local shop and it worked great for awhile. It started acting up so I took it back and the shop had closed down (just my luck). Had another shop tell me it was the TCM (trans control module) so I replaced it ($350) with a new one. Shifts fine now but the spedo started jumping around when stopped so I replaced the speed sensors and that didn't fix it. It drives  and shifts fine but when stopped the speedo jumps between 0-20mph. I am sick of working on it so it has to go.

N.C. Law requires every citizen to attend a State mandated EIGHT (8) hour course prior to filing application for a Concealed Carry Handgun (CCH) Permit (8 hours PLUS range time).  This course meets the requirements established by the North Carolina Department of Criminal Justice Training and Standards Division. This is by far the MOST COMPREHENSIVE COURSE in all of Eastern North Carolina, yet it's the same length as all the rest.

(Note: If someone claiming to be a certified CCH Instructor offers you a CCH Class/Course that is LESS THAN 8 HOURS PLUS RANGE TIME, you should report them to the N.C. D.O.J. Training and Standards Division by calling REDACTED.  If you attend such a course and it’s discovered by the state, you can face criminal charges along with the instructor.)

We make the most of your time both in the classroom and on the range.  We understand most people in Onslow County already know handgun fundamentals; therefore, we focus on teaching you want most people don't know; the LAW.  

Most instructors teach to the minimum standards, and many available CCH courses provide only the bare minimum training required by law.  This would cause students leaves the class without having a real-world understanding of the legal issues.

At Patriot Training and Consulting, we're committed to ensuring every student leaves our courses knowing the law as it pertains to concealed carry, Castle Doctrine, and the use of deadly force.  

This course is for experienced shooters who are proficient with handguns.
If you would like to obtain your Concealed Carry Handgun permit, but don't yet have the training and proficiency, you can take one of our other handgun courses or classes.

During this course, students must pass both a practical shooting test and a written test on the North Carolina Concealed Carry and Use of Deadly Force laws.

Buyer must be 21 (shotguns that come from the factory with a pistol grip are considered ""other firearms"" similar to a stripped AR-15 lower and therefore require the buyer to be 21 (don't worry, no pistol permit/CHL required)) and provide an NCDL.

N.C. Law requires every citizen to attend a State mandated EIGHT (8) hour course prior to filing application for a Concealed Carry Handgun (CCH) Permit (8 hours PLUS range time).  This course meets the requirements established by the North Carolina Department of Criminal Justice Training and Standards Division. This is by far the MOST COMPREHENSIVE COURSE in all of Eastern North Carolina.

(Note: If someone claiming to be a certified CCH Instructor offers you a CCH Class/Course that is LESS THAN I HOURS PLUS RANGE TIME, you should report them to the N.C. D.O.J. Training and Standards Division by calling REDACTED).  If you attend such a course and it’s discovered by the state, you can face criminal charges along with the instructor.)

We make the most of your time both in the classroom and on the range.  We understand most people in Onslow County already know handgun fundamentals; therefore, we focus on teaching you want most people don't know; the LAW.  

Most instructors teach to the minimum standards, and many available CCH courses provide only the bare minimum training required by law.  This would cause students leaves the class without having a real-world understanding of the legal issues.

At Patriot Training and Consulting, we're committed to ensuring every student leaves our courses knowing the law as it pertains to concealed carry, Castle Doctrine, and the use of deadly force.  

This course is for experienced shooters who are proficient with handguns.
If you would like to obtain your Concealed Carry Handgun permit, but don't yet have the training and proficiency, you can take one of our other handgun courses or classes. 

During this course, students must pass both a practical shooting test and a written test on the North Carolina Concealed Carry and Use of Deadly Force laws.

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

For most large ring Mauser style rifles and carbines based on the German 98K design with a flip-up rear sight hinged in the front and including the Turkish M24/47, Czech VZ 24, German Model GEW 98, KAR 98, Yugo M48, Persian (Iran) copies of the Czech M24, Argentine 1909, Spanish 1943, and others based on the original 1898 Mauser design.

The Mauser 8x57 cartridge is in the same class as the American 30-06 and is popular for hunting big game in the United States. This 2.5X scope gives you an excellent field of view at close range while still providing enough magnification to see your target out to 150 yards or more. Take advantage of the inherent accuracy of your Mauser military carbine or rifle by adding this scout scope and increasing your rifle’s effective hunting range.

MOUNT SPECIFICATIONS:
This new scout scope mount has been designed with CROSS BOLT mounting and a nut to insure a solid and rigid installation. We also include extra-low rings to provide low visual alignment mounting of the 2.5x30mm scout scope.

+ For most Mauser 98K caliber 7.9mm (8x57) Rifles with original Mil-Spec rear sights
+ No modifications to rifle required
+ Easy Installation - ""No Gunsmithing"" Mount Replaces Rear Sight – Bolts Directly into Rear Sight Base
+ Hardened Matte Black Aluminum Mount with Multiple Picatinny Rail Slots - accepts Weaver Style Rings
+ One Piece High Tensile Strength Alloy Steel Mounting Bolt with Locking Nut – other scope mounts are made of soft aluminum and use two short screws which can strip the aluminum mount threads or break from the heavy recoil of this rifle.**
+ Allen wrenches and adjusting screws included.
+ Use with Extended Eye Relief (EER) Scopes, Hologram and Red Dot Sights with long or unlimited eye relief. 
+ Standard short eye relief scopes will not work with this mount.

+ New Mount with Manufacturer’s One Year Replacement Warranty
+ NOTE: Due to the age, styles and manufacturing tolerances of the many models of Mauser rifles, some minor fitting of this mount may be required.

Some vendors are selling mounts that use two short bolts threaded into the sides of the mount through the “ears” of the rear sight base.  With extended shooting these bolts strip out the threads in the aluminum scope mount and the mount becomes loose.  Our mount has been threaded completely through and is fitted with a full length threaded cross bolt and retaining nut that securely attaches the scope mount to the rear sight base. This mount will not shoot loose.

ATI's newest addition is the GSG-5P, a pistol chambered in .22LR and based off of their GSG-5 rifle of the same caliber. The GSG-5P is basically a chopped down GSG-5, with all the same durable synthetic material and reliable internals. The GSG-5 has quickly sparked the interest of all .22LR shooters as the highest quality MP-5 clone to date, and the GSG-5P follows right along the same track as the pistol version of the same build. The GSG-5P takes the same magazines as the GSG-5,

I have a 1990 Bayliner Capri 17' foot Bowrider open bow pleasure boat, I am asking $4,000 obo, It has an excellent running ( Force 50 ) 50Hp U.S. Marine Power long shaft outboard motor, That was freshly rebuilt two years ago and has had a new propeller installed on it just a couple months ago, It had a new Deep cycle marine battery installed in it last year and has been on the water once before storing it for the winter...

The Boat also comes with an Escort boat trailer that has Bearing Buddy hubs installed on it that has the centered zirk grease fittings to seal and lub the wheel bearings, It also had the tailights updated to longer lasting waterproof sealed LED tailights a couple years ago, I had it all appraised last fall to add it on my home-owners insurance policy, It appraised for around $6,500 dollars all together for the boat trailer & outboard motor, This it what it all appraised for ( the Boat appraised for $3,000 dollars by itself, the 50hp Outboard motor & controls appraised for $2,500 dollars, & the Escort Trailer appaised for $1,000 dollars ), And that is W/O any boating accessories included...

I have Ohio titles in hand for both the Boat and the Outboard motor, As well as an Ohio DMV registration for the trailer, The boat has a couple years still left on the Boats Registration Sticker that is on the side of the boat, Which is good clear up to March 2013 two seasons from now...

I would prefer to sell it outright, But would be willing to consider trade offers for a really good running ""2004"" or newer 500cc or bigger Utility style 4x4 ATV four wheeler with a snow plow and a trailerbif possible to haul it, Or maybe a nice ""2000"" or newer Side by Side 4wd UTV from makers like ( Polaris , Honda , John Deere , Kawasaki , Can Am , Suzuki , Cub Cadet ) and so on...

I would also be willing to consider trading for a good running Compact style tractor with front end loader or backhoe attachment on it, Something like a ( Kubota, Yanmar, John Deere, Case, Ford, Cub Cadet ) and so on, As long as it is a good running piece of Equipment that does not have any major issues...

I would also prefer trades to have some kind of a trailer with it, So that it can be hauled around to where ever I would need to take it if possible... 

So just email me if you have any questions or trade offers you want me to consider, The worst I can say is no thank you for your offer, You can also contact me at ( 7 four 0 ) five 4 three - 3 eight 5 two, And ask for Ken or Kenneth..."
