What about its tonewoods? Taylor gave the T5 Classic a stunning Ovangkol top with a gentle sapele wood body to complement it. Ovangkol is known for its warm, mellow voice — and it's the perfect tonewood to take advantage of the T5's classic highly versatile pickup configuration. Another way Taylor gives you exceptional tone from the T5 Classic is in the very body design itself. The stylized f-holes do more than command the eye, they also enhance the resonance of the T5 Classic's body chamber, allowing the top to breathe and capture the dynamics of your heartfelt performance.

The Taylor T5 Classic is the guitar to choose when you want to get the versatility of having multiple guitars, without the extra cost and weight of lugging them around. Stylish and with a deceptively simple, classic, streamlined appearance, the Taylor T5 Classic is a true player's guitar.

Some folks take their plinking seriously. It's not enough to just have any old wood-stocked .22 Long Rifle semi-auto in their hands. They're ready to take advantage of the growing selection of Tactical .22s, also known as Modern Sporting .22 Rifles, now available on the market. These .22s are near carbon copies of full-size combat rifles. However, they have been modified to be less expensive to buy and to shoot. To flesh out this growing field of tactical can tappers, ISSC Austria has stepped forward with its contribution—the MK22.
For fans of the FN-SCAR battle rifle, the MK22 should look very familiar. Along with the FN-style stock and receiver outline, the MK22 has many of the same features as the rifle that inspired it. The receiver is an all-metal construction, with a Picatinny-style rail system on all receiver surfaces. This includes a barrel placement for attaching FN sights. The mussle of the precision match, 16-inch barrel is cut with a 1:28 thread to accept various muzzle breaks and flash hiders.

The three-position shoulder stock is adjustable for length, features a sling buckle mount and it has a two-position cheek rest that adjusts for height. The stock is fitted with a metal hinge to fold to the side with a polymer frame hook to lock the stock in the folded position for tactical training exercises. Both 10- and 22-round magazines are available.
The adjustable front and rear rifle sights can be folded down to make room for a scope. When in the down position, the sights become a three-dot pistol system. The three-dots are not terribly useful on this gun, but an interesting idea nonetheless. The charging handle is part of the patent-pending Universal Charging Adaption System (UCAS), which allows the handle to be moved to three locations on the right or left side of the gun. The hollow grip is fitted with a removable base plate so it can be used for storage. The MK22 is available in a black or tan finish.
The one thing missing from this rifle is a useful set of cleaning instructions. Maintenance is important for any firearm, but semi-auto .22s are notorious for getting exceptionally grimy. The instructions don’t allow for complete field stripping of the rifle, but they also warn against the spray-on solvents that would be useful when cleaning a partially stripped rifle. So shooters are left to figure something out on their own.
I took advantage of the accessory rail system to dress up the gun a bit. The lower rail provided an ideal location for the Streamlight TLR-1. The rail had plenty of room to move this compact, powerful flashlight back and forth to find the ideal location operation. This rifle also provided good opportunity to take LaserLyte's K-15T laser for a test drive. You may not see the need for a cutting-edge green laser for knocking over pop cans, but if you’re using the MK22 as an affordable stand-in for an FN, then testing a laser makes sense. For long range work, an Alpen Optics Model 4031 3-9 x 42 scope was affixed to the top rail with quick release rings to provide a crisp, clear view of the targets. However, even with 1-inch high rings, there was not enough room to leave the collapsed rear iron sight attached, so the rear sight was removed when the scope was in use.
At the Range
The price tag on the ISSC MK22 places it in the center of the price range for the current set of tactical .22s on the market, but the dollars spent are reflected in the heft and balance provided by the all-steel barrel and aluminum receiver. Some companies, in an effort to make their tactical .22s more affordable, have used too much polymer. The guns feel like they should be filled with water from a garden hose rather than loaded with ammunition. But shouldering and shooting the MK22 feels like you are running a ""real"" gun. The recoil of the MK22 is feather light, as is to be expected. The trigger is smooth, gauging out at 4-pounds, 12-ounces, with some creep after the firing pin is released. Formal accuracy testing was conducted from a bench rest using five consecutive, five-shot groups with targets set out to 100 yards.
The overall accuracy results at 100 yards were not awe-inspiring, but they were relatively consistent. The best single group of 2.75 inches was produced by Winchester's new M22 40-grain black copper-plated round nose ammunition. The M22 also produced the best average group set with a measurement of 3.2 inches. The next best performer was CCI's new AR Tactical 40-grain copper-plated round nose with a best single group of 3 inches, and a five-group average of 3.35 inches. Third place goes to CCI Velocitor 40-grain copper-plated hollow points, with a best group of 3.5 inches, and an average of 4.1 inches. These three test loads ran without any failures during the formal testing and during the extended informal testing.
The MK22's accuracy was markedly better at 50 yards. During informal testing at this range, using a full spread of high quality and inexpensive bulk rounds, results hovered around the 2-inch mark, with ragged less-than-an-inch holes produced with quality ammunition. This rifle has a very low ammunition fussiness factor, running with almost no problems across several varieties of ammunition fired. Three malfunctions occurred during this portion of the testing. One was a failure to eject resulting in the need to pry the spent case out of the chamber, followed by two stove-pipes. The failures all occurred with the same brand of affordably priced bulk ammunition. Since no other malfunctions occurred in the course of firing hundreds of rounds, the problems can be written off to that particular load.
Fifty yards turned out to be an ideal range to work with the K-15T laser. At this range, even in bright, late-afternoon sunlight, the green dot was visible on the various targets used. As the afternoon wore on and the sun started to set, the dot just got brighter. This LaserLyte sight is easy to dial in and work with, and it looks pretty cool on the gun.
Final Thoughts
The greatest strength of this rifle is the flexibility of its possible applications. For an understudy to the full-throttle FN-SCAR, a customizable small game hunter or over-the-top plinker, the MK22 can do it all with panache. I've even heard folks suggest that the combat features of this rifle make it a candidate for a low-recoil self-defense option for the injured or elderly. With quality ammunition, and enough rounds fired with proper shot placement, it could do the trick. For those folks who take their .22s seriously, the MK22 is seriously fun to work with.

I'm not really looking for money I need a new lower receiver for ar-15/m-4 style rifle
This gun cost $599 new, and most lower receivers only cost in the 300 range. So don't try ripping me off I ve been doing this a long time. I willing to trade down. Meaning you get a good gun worth more than the lower you are trading me. I'm not interested in marketed up lowers when DPMS is having ar-15s on shelves again in two weeks for $499. Yes you heard that right $499. And for all those people who say well DPMS are crappy guns. They are the made and assembled with the same molds and metals as Colt and Bushmaster. Look it up all three are the same company.

Long story short this gun was a attempt to break the glock monopoly in my safe. Basically I've decided I'd like to trade this for a glock 21 SF gen3 or a Gen 4 as I'm far more used to the glock platform and ergonomics. The glocks msrp was $40 more and considering the third mag and extension I'd say it balances out. I could add for more mags etc but wont take it in the shorts on this. Just looking to see if anybody has a 21 but would prefer the xd ergos. Any interest let me know. Thanks

I have an Ultrasonics International unit, it is an industrial ultrasonic cleaner and it cleans in the 38 KHz frequency.

20-25 gallon double wall insulated stainless steel tank with drain valve and stainless steel parts basket, with lid. Tank size is 18""W x 19.5"" L x 17.5"" D which allows you to fit many more items than the smaller 1-4 gallon units will accept.

24 transducers operating in the 38 KHz range through 12 Vibra-Bars on the bottom of the tank provides the ultrasonic action.

The power supply is a 1200 watt unit that provides Frequency Sweep mode to degas the solution and to provide more aggressive cleaning. Amplifier power is controlled via a knob on the power supply which allows adjustment for fine cleaning or more aggressive cleaning.

Unit does not have an integral heat source to the tank to fail or burn out, instead an immersion heater (bucket heater) can be used to raise the temp of the solution and can be easily replaced for a few bucks and zero work if it fails.

It works wonderfully on fired brass, and due to the generous size of the tank entire pistols can be cleaned, rifle lowers, shotgun receivers, etc. will all fit into the tank. It can be used to clean carbs, jewelry, and your fingernails... or just about anything else you want to stick into it.

Small parts can be placed into ziploc bags of cleaning solution and sealed with some air in the bag, they can then floated in the cleaning solution without contaminating it with dirt. Small parts can also be cleaned while floating in a smaller container filled with solution. The ultrasonic action will pass through the container and clean the parts inside.

I had purchased it for cleaning VW transaxles for rebuilding, but have since moved to another piece of equipment to handle cleaning so it is time for this to go to make room in the garage.

$2000 or best offer and I prefer local sales, I don't want to ship it due to the weight and need for 2 packages (tank and power unit). I can take a credit card through paypal but prefer cash. I can meet in the Columbus area."

20-25 gallon double wall insulated stainless steel tank with drain valve and stainless steel parts basket, with lid. Tank size is 18""W x 19.5"" L x 17.5"" D which allows you to fit many more items than the smaller 1-4 gallon units will accept.

24 transducers operating in the 38 KHz range through 12 Vibra-Bars on the bottom of the tank provides the ultrasonic action.

The power supply is a 1200 watt unit that provides Frequency Sweep mode to degas the solution and to provide more aggressive cleaning. Amplifier power is controlled via a knob on the power supply which allows adjustment for fine cleaning or more aggressive cleaning.

Unit does not have an integral heat source to the tank to fail or burn out, instead an immersion heater (bucket heater) can be used to raise the temp of the solution and can be easily replaced for a few bucks and zero work if it fails.

It works wonderfully on fired brass, and due to the generous size of the tank entire pistols can be cleaned, rifle lowers, shotgun receivers, etc. will all fit into the tank. It can be used to clean carbs, jewelry, and your fingernails... or just about anything else you want to stick into it.

Small parts can be placed into ziploc bags of cleaning solution and sealed with some air in the bag, they can then floated in the cleaning solution without contaminating it with dirt. Small parts can also be cleaned while floating in a smaller container filled with solution. The ultrasonic action will pass through the container and clean the parts inside.

I had purchased it for cleaning VW transaxles for rebuilding, but have since moved to another piece of equipment to handle cleaning so it is time for this to go to make room in the garage.

$2000 or best offer and I prefer local sales, I don't want to ship it due to the weight and need for 2 packages (tank and power unit). I can take a credit card through paypal but prefer cash. I can meet in the Columbus area."

Although it is on the same style frame as the 1911 and has all of the same features, its compact size with a 3"" barrel is ideal for carrying.  The 9mm round is significantly more lethal than the smaller .380 ultra compacts like S&W Bodyguards and Sig P238s and its slightly larger size makes it much easier to hold.  Its and 8+1 capacity gives you that extra round over the ultra compacts.  You also get that smooth single action trigger and beaver tail safety that is not available on the smaller .380s.  Last but not least...Colts are better than money in the bank. Treat them well and you will always make a profit."

It has 6 steel 10 round mags to go with it.
The AK has been completely cerakoted in graphic black and the wood furniture has been refinished in Russian Red. It will come with 2 complete sets of furniture, one set is original the other set is Bulgarian with a pistol grip.
I am interested in trading for a Government sized 1911, but will consider all offers. I like a wide variety of guns and calibers, I also reload 9mm, 45 acp, and 357 sig so a combination of weapons and reloading supplies will be looked at closely. I could use a good spotting scope if you have one you would like to pair with something else to make it a more appealing offer.

I do not need to get rid of this gun so if the right deal does not come along I will keep this in the safe, I am wanting to trade it as I am really wanting a 1911. I would also consider a pistol in 10 mm like a S&W or Colt, I'm not to fond of Glock 10mm pistols.
Trade should be in the Hampton Roads area, FTF, with 2 forms of ID and we will do a bill of sale. So no felons.  Will consider a cash price as well."

Very Clean, very little wear. Includes 2-10rd magazines with extensions, box, paperwork and everything from the factory.


The Glock 26, often referred to as the ""baby Glock,"" has created a true and practical auto pistol alternative to the standard five shot snub nose revolver. The ""safe action"" system consists of three (3) automatic independently operating mechanical safeties which are sequentially disengaged when pulling the trigger and which are automatically re-engaged when releasing the trigger. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds as standard and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain the worldwide distribution among security personnel and secret services.

Due to the high demand for AR15 style rifles, we only have one of these in stock currently, but we will have a second one very soon.  The first person to contact us has the option to buy, but we will not hold it unless you commit to buy it, and make arrangements for the purchase/payment.  We will edit this listing to reflect there is a sale pending, but the listing will remain active until the sale is final.  Please read everything below for important listing/sales information.

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check.  Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance. This listing will be deleted if the gun is sold.  

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information.  If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize we cannot pay full retail for your firearm.  We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 SAS is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with custom wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® Night Sights. The new SIG SAUER P238 SAS is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine.
