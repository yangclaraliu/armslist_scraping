The firing pin hits to the shell casing rather than the primer center. Therefore I have to buy a new 5"" 10mm Barrel as per the Gunsmith doing the work to bring it back to a fine shooter it once was and not a Paperweight she is now. I also need the link and Pin as their worn badly. He's going to try and save the barrel as it has ridges from front to rear. It was a great shooter and very accurate but now to hit the Bullseye I have to aim to the top of the target and Pray for a hit. If anybody has the barrel, Link and Pin call John at REDACTED. or REDACTED    Thank You John"

This revolver has the most beautiful blueing I have ever seen on any S&W revolver. It is a deep blue/black lustre finish that rivals, or supasses what you may expect to find on a comparable condition early model Colt Python. Suffice it to say, the pictures do not do justice to this incredible revolver. Aside from a barely noticable turn line, the fit and finish is near perfect (99.9%). The weapon is in used condition however, I do not have the original box or papers - sorry. That aside, this will make a handsome addition to any S&W collection and will likely not be seen again."

Only fired when tested at the factory and twice by me. Included are all original accessories: cleaning rod and cleaning kit, oil bottle, and manual. Also, will include 100 rounds of FMJ ammo.

If you aren't familiar with Saiga rifles, then I highly recommend that you do some reading and know exactly what you are buying. This is a true soviet-made kalashnikov pattern rifle. There are a lot of A.K. clones out there. Many of them are re-built from de-milled romanian receivers and stripped down junked parts kits, and aren't worth the time and effort it took to give them hardware and make them look shiny and new again, only to cut a big slice out of someone's wallet that doesn't know the difference. Don't be ""that guy."" Do your homework.

If you want to build a mega bad-ass A.K., a Saiga is a great place to start. This is an awesome project rifle, and the .308 is the easiest full conversion of all receivers. 

This is a stamped receiver, not milled. You should know the difference. The finish on them is little more than a high-temp flat black. It wears relatively easily, but is easy to re-finish or touch up. It isn't made to be pretty, it's a freakin ""tractor."" Can you drive a tank over a stamped receiver? Probably not. Is it still the same 110% reliable A.K. action? Abso-freakin-loutely! Drag it through the mud, pour some sand in it, throw it in the pond...it doesn't care. It will fire every time. It's an A.K.! Another big plus is these rifles can chew through the cheap soviet-made steel cased ammo like nobody's business! A very affordable rifle to shoot! 

You need to be familiar with 922R before you purchase this rifle. In it's stock configuration this rifle does not have enough U.S. parts to be legally used with high capacity magazines. Even a U.S. made magazine does not count as enough legal parts on it's own! KNOW 922R BEFORE YOU BUY THIS WEAPON!

The price is $450 FIRM. At this price you have saved an FFL transfer fee, shipping, tax, and are practically getting the ammo for free, so the price doesn't move. Not happening.

CMMG carbine piston conversion replaces front sight base, handguard cap, handguards and bolt carrier on any gas operated AR-15 style upper. Piston systems operate cleaner due to hot gasses being diverted at the gas block instead of the upper receiver. Piston is hard chrome plated and is removable from the front of the gas block. The one piece bolt carrier has an integral impingement key for maximum strength. Gas block has an on and off setting for use with a suppressor, or remove the piston and set the gas system to off for use with our .22 conversion system. For use on any AR-15 or M-16 with any any caliber and any barrel length with a carbine gas system."

Even though I may have paid more for it than people have paid for them in the past, I'd say it is worth far more in terms of quality and reliability. If I didn't all ready have a great carry gun, I'd keep it. (This is easier to conceal than my SP101, but that gun's not going anywhere.)

Just bought this last month. Put 200 rounds through it, perfect. A really fun gun to shoot, I just want to get rid of it before I get too attached. There are too many other things I want right now.

The P99 provides the shooter with a user-friendliness previously found only in hammer fired pistols. Traditional Double Action The anti-stress trigger makes the P99 one of the world's safest firearms by preventing unintentional ""reflex"" firing in stressful situations. The decisive innovation: When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon loading, the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot; not only in the double action trigger mode, but also in the single action mode. The trigger travel is .551"" long in the anti-stress mode (at 4.4 lbs. trigger force), preventing inadvertent firing. On all subsequent shots, the trigger travel is reduced to .314"" (at the same trigger force) and this permits firing in rapid sequence, due to the quick reset of the P99 trigger. Enhanced Safety The P99 AS is equipped with a decocking button to safely decock the striker. It acts as an automatic safety and is integrated directly into the slide to prevent snagging on clothing even if the gun is drawn quickly.
I personally have only put 75 rounds through it. I purchased it in December 2010. I do ask that we transfer it through an FFL. If you have any questions, please ask!"

Remington 11-87 semi-auto 12 gauge with Remington factory fully rifled 21-inch slug barrel, open rifle sights, stock stud/ammo tube cap for mounting sling and black composite stock in standard adult size (not a youth model stock). Either 2 3/4-inch or 3-inch shells.

This has been an accurate field gun with the full rifled barrel and sabot slugs.  The blueing on the barrel is in very nice condition and the bore/rifling is in excellent condition.  The left side of the receiver has an area of light scratches on it - they were there when I bought it - that I tried to show in one of the photos.  The stock is in nice condition with some minor field marks from use.  It shoots and works exactly like it should.

There is no corrosion, pitting, dents, etc.  The shotgun has been cleaned and lubed after each use and a full wipe down with Birchwood Casey Sheath was applied before off-season storage.

For anyone seriously interested, more pictures are available by email.

The Benelli M2 is the workhorse of the semi-auto Benelli shotguns, with the speed of a thoroughbred. Light, nimble, but ruggedly built, the M2 12-gauge shotguns are built around the ultra-reliable Inertia Driven bolt mechanism. The Inertia Driven system allows the M2 to digest nearly any 12 gauge cartridge, from 2-3/4"" target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums.

Benelli engineers have also adapted the recoil system for the M2. This revolutionary system reduces felt recoil by up to 48% and cuts muzzle climb by 15%. When combined, this puts the shooter back on target up to 69% faster than with any other comparable semi-automatic shotgun. The M2 is not only faster, but with the new system, it may be the most comfortable shotgun you will ever shoot.

No problem, just throw the lever over, the Eotech pops off, when you want it back on just throw the lever back over it's that simple. It will even generally hold a zero to within .5 MOA or so, no need to rezero!  This optic is in excellent condition, with only a pair of tiny silver nicks on the protective hood which seperate it from looking new.

If you are unfamiliar with this optic, it is a very sturdy, reliable, fast, and effective holographic red dot sight. It features a 1 MOA dot inside a 65 MOA circle, meaning the dot is one inch wide at 100 meters. It is adjustable for several brightness setttings. What's best about this optic that seperates it from Wal-Mart specials is that it is very sturdy. Eotech's are commonly purchased by servicemembers for use on their duty rifles overseas, because they are sturdy, reliable, and very fast on target. 350 and a pick-up in/near the Stillwater area please.

IF you don't know what this is, the MAK-90 stands for Modified AK 1990. These came out as a go-around of the Brady Bill's ""assault rifle"" ban. They sold it with 5 round mags as a hunting rifle. Somehow, 5 round mags and a thumb hole grip make it for HUNTING instead of BATTLE use! Who knew?!

This is a cool piece of Brady Bill history and also a great AK. This one has a clean title and sports a closed front sight, thumb hole grip/stock, and a MILLED receiver! Very Reliable, too! Fires straight and really is a nail driver at 100 yards. Well, by AK standards that is.

It's in good shape and hasn't been fired much at all. Bought in 95 and has simply been stored for most of that time. I cleaned it up and it shined nicely. The bluing is great on this rifle. The mechanics are great, too. The only thing is the upper handguard has a few bad spots and the rear of the stock has a scratch on it. That's why I'm taking a hit on the price."

I have an IMI Model B for sale registered receiver, or I will trade for a diamond engagement ring. Yep, it's that time. Giving up the guns for the little lady.

Anyways, it is my appreciation that this is an R/R IMI Model B that was imported by Action Arms. According to my information and my tax stamp, it is a Fleming conversion of an Action Arms-imported IMI UZI Model B. It is in excellent shape, and I have personally run less than a case of 9mm through it without any trouble.

As you can see from the pictures, this UZI will come with a Fab Arms Israeli aluminum tri-rail and a tri-lug barrel. The tri-lug barrel is new, never fired through. I will throw in an Aimpoint optics mount, which is very sturdy and very rare, a spare parts kit, and 3 magazines. The silencer, sling, and foregrip are not included.

I am also including the complete Blackjack cyclical rate alteration buffers, which vary the ROF from 650 RPM-1100 RPM depending on buffer used and ammo type.

Further, I will include the pictured UZI Jeep mounting bracket. This is an incredibly rare piece of UZI history, and is designed to secure the UZI inside a moving vehicle.

Finally, I am willing to pay the first stamp to your dealer.

UZI is on a Form 4 in Florida.
