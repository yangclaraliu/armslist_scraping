Winchester number 4 steel shot. She said she wanted regular ammo and he said here you go. When I found out what she bought I immediately went to the store to exchange. Of course the manager said no way so I need to get rid of these guys.
I dont hunt ducks or turkey or any of the like. Make me an offer and please be fair. These shells are 26 bucks a box. I dont need shelf value but I would like ot get more than what I pay for regular shells.

They banned them last time and they are atop their list again! These are now sold as the Calico M110 with an MSRP of $703 when you find them, the M100P was the Preban model i.e. made before 1994.

Good mechanical shape, no functional problems. Minor finish blemishes you'd expect in something 20 years old.

These were hard to find before the frenzy, almost impossible to locate now.  I paid over retail obviously, so please don't waste your time with subpar cash offers as I will not bother to respond - am not in need to sell and will keep it or take to auction if need be.  

I put the trade value around $850.  I know that seems high, but it appears everyone has jacked up the value of their stuff, and as such, I cannot be exptected to take all the loss.

I don't like it either and hope it will be over soon and return to normal, but none of us really know.  When you see $700 ARs and AKs going for $1500-$2200+, and $13 mags going for $50, one has no choice to adjust their prices accordingly (thanks Libs and american sheeple!) or stay out of the game entirely.  

With the exception of revolvers, shotguns, and semi-autos under 10 rds, everything is high now.

Prefer FTF and all trades must be FTF so we can both inspect each other's items, but will ship for $40 from FFL to FFL for the right price.  

I am looking for a these in trade (combinations work too), or trade plus cash.  I can also kick in cash or other stuff for higher-end items:

.45 or 9mm autos (no 1911's please) - am partial to Glocks/sigs/HK.

.22 pistol (Ruger MK or similiar), Keltec PMR.

Modern revolvers (LCR, GP100, etc), don't need safe queen collectibles or Grandpa's 50 year keepsake, sorry.

Semi-auto battle rifles (5.56, .308, AKs, Saiga) 

Tactical shotguns, pump or semi-auto with 18"" barrels (590A1, 870, Benelli)

Glock 4th gen mags or 9mm ammo (124 or 147gr) - no 115gr unless its on the super cheap and no steel/aluminum case at all.

Am open to other trades not listed as long as its not junk (hipoint, taurus, DPMS, etc.) - worse I can say is no thanks.  

Absolutely no bolt-action rifles, long-barreled or O/U shotguns, or any other FUDD style hunting weapons please.  If there is wood on it or it's camo, I basically have no interest in it.

The slim sleek snag free design makes this the ultimate ccw pistol. This pistol does not have any safeties (the reason why she doesn't want it), there is no mag disconnect safety allowing you to fire the weapon without a magazine if there is a round in the chamber. The pistol comes with a glock style trigger mechanism so if dropped it will not fire. 

Comes with original shipping box, Beretta hard plastic case, gun lock, manual and all paperwork that it came with, and a 6 rd magazine.

The sale will be face to face, Cash, Bill of Sale signed by both of us, and a copy of F.O.I.D. & D.L.  exchanged by both.
I can meet at a local gun shop if you would like.

I was under the impression that we gun folk were freedom loving, Constitution abiding, advocates of the FREE MARKET. But apparently some people don't see it that way. 

Charging high prices for certian guns or ammo is not 'evil', as some socialists would have you believe, but rather a natrual by-product of the AMERICAN Capitalist free market system.

The free market is made up of two fundamental factors which dictate price. Supply and demand. When demand rises but supply remains constant, prices increase. Likewise when demand decreases, prices along with supply will decrease with it and thus the markets constantly strive for a point where supply = demand. This point is called equilibrium.

 With talk of legislation and bans around the corner, people are suddenly in a frenzy to buy firearms and ammunition. This is the demand. Thus prices will natrually increase to reflect demand until supply is increased. 

This is not 'evil' because in a free market you are free to buy or sell anything you want. You aren't forced to buy anything! If the price is too high, you will not buy. If you feel you can sell a box of .22 for one million dollars you are free to do so. But nobody will buy it. And you will either decrease your price or never sell it. You see this system isn't evil because you aren't being forced to buy anything. Boycotting isn't neccessary because the price you are willing to pay decides the price. If you feel something is priced to high don't buy it! And by doing so you are decreasing demand which will in turn help the market stabalize and reach equilibrium. 

Lets not embarass ourselves to the socialists in Washington who would want to regulate small buisnesses and the American free market out of work. Unless you want some federal law dictating how and what you can sell and at what prices."

I bought it new from a local dealer. I later replaced the factory sights with Trijicon night sights (green front and rear orange which all appear white in daylight). The sights, which cost $100 at the time, are bright with five years remaining on the Trijicon factory warranty. I have the original receipts for both the gun and the sights, but I did not keep the plastic box. I can't say exactly how many rounds I've fired with this pistol, but I'm sure it was not more than ten boxes (500 rounds). In other words, it's barely getting warmed up. I never experienced a misfire with a variety of ammo. The handgun comes with three 15-round magazines (one magazine from an earlier generation G22). I bought an extra spring-guide rod assembly just in case I might need it, which I will include in the sale. My current price is firm and I am not interested in trades. I'm accepting only face-to-face cash transactions. I do not have an FFL. This would be a private party sale. If you look younger than 21 years old, lucky you, but I will request to see an official ID to prove that you've reached your 21st birthday. I also will ask that you fill out a simple private-party sales receipt for my protection. At the moment, I'm too lazy to take and upload a picture, but if you really want pictures, I'll email some. To me, this pistol looks new. There are no dents or scratches. Incredibly, I've never dropped it. Again, I'm accepting only cash payment. Thanks for your interest."

This is a brand new, unopened Colt LE6920. The pictures are of a rifle that I've removed from the box to take pictures but the rifle that you will receive is still in the original unopened box. 

The Colt 6920 comes with the Rogers Super Stock with secondary lock.
Includes (2) twenty round magazines, detachable carry handle and carry strap.

Lower is stamped with the Colt Logo and Colt spelled out M4 CARBINE CAL. 5.56MM and has a SN# that starts with LE. Has COLT DEFENSE HARTFORD, CONN. U.S.A. stamped on it. Fire and Safe marked on both sides of the receiver. 

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the 6920 carbine is less than 32"" collapsed in length and weighs only 6.91 lb - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's 6920 carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components 
- Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm) 
- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- Two 20 round magazines, cleaning kit and sling are standard. 
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness

These revolvers are also known as the “Airweights” and are regarded as one of Smith & Wesson’s most popular designs for conceal carry. It's light (weighs only 15 oz.) and I've carried it comfortably in my front pocket without being detected. This one sports an Uncle Mike's grip. I bought it brand new a year ago (box says it was manufactured in 2011) and am selling because I’ve been carrying another J-frame more often, so this one has been sitting in my safe untouched since mid-summer. I’ve shot about 75 rounds through it and it’s in great condition and has been kept clean. Feel free to ask any questions. I’ve included pictures below.
