USP Compact .45, AH date code (2007), German made. V1 DA/SA with safety and decocker. Factory sights (not tritium). Outstanding handling, very accurate handgun for CC, range or home defense use. This was a law enforcement trade-in gun with unknown round count. Based on wear, I estimate a few thousand rounds. It's an HK... it's just getting broken in. I shot this gun in several courses and it performed flawlessly. 

Gun has some holster wear on slide and frame. See photos here and many more at 
http://s1060.beta.photobucket.com/user/Noncentsical/library/HK%20Pics/USP45c

For preventative maintenance, I replaced extractor, extractor spring and recoil bushing with new factory parts. This gun should be good to go for many thousands of rounds. 

Includes two 8-round factory German-made magazine, original plastic box, manual, test fire shell case and lockout key. 
Also includes a Blackhawk Serpa holster!

Put one together and you will see. The BRP Corp Ultra High Precision (UHP) 15 is specifically made to meet the need for a rugged and precise lower receiver for today's AR style rifles. They hold half of the mil-spec tolerance to ensure exact fits and smooth function. These lower receivers are machined from forged 7075 aluminum blanks using only the best tooling available. They take their time making these and it shows in the quality of the machining. Not only are the milled slots and reamed holes precise, they are also clean and smooth. The internal machining is among the cleanest you will ever see in an AR-type rifle. Once machined and checked, the receivers are hard-coat anodized. They also have a set screw tightening feature at the rear lug area to eliminate any movement between the upper and lower assemblies."

-Any Springfield Armory .40 or .45 (my preferred choice is the sub compact .40 with the 2 different mag sizes.)
-a Bushmaster or a branded AR-15...I would prefer something that wasnt pieced together.
-maybe some sort of cool self defense shotgun, but don't need.

Anyway, that's my list. I really want the subcompact Springfield armory .40 xd so if you can part with yours email me and I'll trade you or pay cash. Stay safe guys, and I will show colo ID and do everything above board. I would prefer to purchase from a private party because I'm sort of a privacy nut.

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

New from SIG SAUER®, the P938 SAS. The pistol has gone through a radical dehorning process resulting in an ultra smooth, snag free profile that’s ideal for concealed carry. It’s just a fraction of the size of our full-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.9 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 16.0 ounces, the SIG SAUER P938 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P938 SAS is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with custom wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® Night Sights. The new SIG SAUER P938 SAS is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine. 

NOTE: This pistol is new in box but does have some slight wear on the barrel (probably from test firing).

After acquiring a S&W 586 I did not shoot it that much.  

When I purchased the Hi-Power I thought the trigger pull was a bit much for target shooting so had a gunsmith take it down from the original military 8 lbs to a more usable 2.5-3.0 lbs.  I also purchased a couple of extra magazines for a total of four that come with the pistol.  This Belgium made version comes with the rosewood grips.

The Hi-Power is in excellent use condition with some wear on the blueing where I gripped the pistol.

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

Chambered for the NATO .308 (7.62X51) round, it will ""reach"" out much farther than the .223 (5.56X45).  Gas operated, with one 30 round magazine included

I'm told by a nice fellow Armslister that this is an Austrian Version of the FAL, designated as STG-58.  You can see pictures in more info on these rifles at http://50ae.net/collection/stg58/

According to the FAL Files website: The Fusil Automatique Leger (FAL) or Light Automatic Rifle (LAR) manufactured by Fabrique National, was originally designed to fire the 7.92mm Kurz cartridge developed by the Germans in World War II. However, post-war pressure for a more powerful cartridge produced the compromise 7.62mm x 51 (.308 Winchester), which could easily be manufactured on machines producing the .30 caliber service cartridge. The new more powerful round was selected as the NATO standard.
FN rebuilt their rifle to fit the new cartridge and created what is possibly the classic post-war battle rifle. Tough, reliable, and accurate, the new design promptly cornered the market, selling to armed forces in more than 90 countries around the world including Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, India, Israel, Libya, Peru, Singapore and the UK. All FALs share the reliability that solid construction and attention to detail creates. Most are also capable of automatic fire.



This rifle has the look like it just came off the front lines.  The olive-green furniture is all USA-made.  The weapon still has the safety lever that goes from S (safe) to  F(fire) and swivels over to A(full auto).  Of course, the full auto sear is not present, so the gun is a legal semi-auto only.  But the lever is still there, which is cool.  The heavy-duty all-steel military bipod is present, and folds up into the metal hand guard so as to become invisible, with no sharp edges or protrusions.  Really a beautifully designed rifle.  The carry handle is also still present.  This is not your typical mall-rat rifle with all the plastic (oh, sorry, composite) accessories.  Everything but the furniture is real metal.  Bluing/parkerizing is probably 60-70% there, and the bore looks great.  Adjustable front hooded post front sight, and elevation adjustable rear peep sight.  

Unfortunately, all this being said, I do not have much information on this particular rifle.   There are no markings on other than a clear 5-digit serial number ( 50XXX ) on the lower receiver.  I'LL REPEAT: THERE ARE NO MARKINGS THAT I CAN FIND ON THE UPPER RECEIVER.  Please don't add your name to the list of people who have e-mailed me asking who made the receiver... I do not know.  Anyone (well, almost anyone!) is welcome to come take a look for themselves. The weapon looks to me to have nice clear machining and good fitting parts.  I have owned everything from Springfield National Match M1A1's to  Chinese SKS's, and the fit and finish more closely resembles the Springfield than any Chinese or Russian manufactured weapon.  I have owned this rifle for years, but only fired a box of ammo through it.  Worked fine when I used it, but I have not fired it enough to endorse it.  It has sat in my dry safe the rest of the time.  Comes with one high capacity 30 round magazine and sling.

I do not need to go though an FFL, but I would like to see an ID for my records, and I would greatly prefer a CWP.

I might be interested in certain trades like large-bore S&W or Colt revolvers, interesting/unique antique arms, but no junk please.  I'm not interesting in any SKS's, AK-47's, .38/.357 revolvers (sorry- already have enough), shotguns, or 1911's (except maybe a US-manufactured military model - can't hurt to dream!) Might also consider a trade for a nice Honda inverter generator (3K or larger).  I could trade up or down with cash as needed.  Never hurts to ask.

Price is ""fairly"" firm.  If you come look at it and make an offer, I would consider it, but please don't e-mail me and ask if I will take $800.  No, I will not at this point.

I would consider shipping, but then I would need to go through an FFL, and the buyer would pay all associated shipping and registration costs.  But I would box up and prepare for shipping for free!

I'm located in Skagit County (near Mt. Vernon, Burlington and Sedro-Woolley)

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

If you want to trade we will work out shipment and FFL stuff as I am located in NC.

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

a) the ONLY trades considered are in caliber: 6.5x55swede - that' it!
b) you and I both know that this rifle will be more expensive than a AR-15 in a very nearest future when ammo supplies dry up.  This is shooting your regular bolt action cartridge - which will probably be the only affordable ammo left along with 7.62x54r, 7.5x55 and few others...  I do NOT want to contribute to current price gouging and or panic - simply because I think it is wrong, but whatever...  
c) I do not NEED to sell it, I want to sell it, thus my price says firm vs. OBO.  
d) Again, Thank you for your interest!

This Hakim is in wonderful condition, as you can see from the pictures. Comes with one 10rd magazine and also a correct sling (sling I believe is swedish).  Mirror bore - thus it was not shot out with corrosive ammo.  shoots your 8mm cartridge in a semi-auto mode. LOUD!  has a gas adjustment port, thus you can set your optimal setting - huge benefit to a reloader (unlike Swedish Ljungman AG-42b) because you can actually find and reuse your brass.  I can meet a buyer within 25miles of zip: 54956 - which means: HWY41 south as far as HWY26 exit, HWY41 north as far as hwy55 exit (kaukauna).  did I mention it is cash only purchase???  Well, if you have a partial trade in 6.5x55swedish rifle/carbine - we can certainly discuss it, however that is the ONLY trade possibility.
see pictures as these will be very informative and will show you the condition of the rifle.
history of the rifle:
 Caliber: 7,92x57 mm
Action: Gas operated, tilting bolt
Overall length: 1216 mm / 47,9""
Barrel length: 638 mm  / 25,1""
Weight: 4,4 kg / 9,7 lbs
Magazine capacity: 10 rounds



Hakim rifle was adopted by Egyptian army during early fifties, after initial purchase of some Swedish-made Ljungman AG-42 rifles chambered for 7,92mm Mauser ammunition. Hakim rifle, in fact, was a minor alteration ow the Swedish design, with most visible change being addition of the prominent muzzle brake, necessary because of use of more powerful 7,92mm ammunition (as opposed to original 6,5mm Swedish ammunition, which has relatively smooth recoil). There also were minor changes in external appearance, but basic design remained the same. Production of Hakim rifles continued through 1950s and 1960s on machinery purchased from Sweden, with some 70 thousands rifles being made. Later on, Egyptians developed a scaled-down version of the Hakim rifle, designated Rasheed, and produced it in minor numbers.

Hakim rifle is gas operated, semi-automatic only, magazine fed rifle. It uses direct-impingement gas system developed in Sweden by Erik Eklund, with added manual gas valve that permitted adjustments for various types of ammunition. Locking is achieved by tipping the rear of the bolt down and into the recess in receiver. Cocking of the bolt is provided by sliding top cover which has gripping serrations on either side. To cock the action, one must push the sliding cover all the way forward, then pull it back. Manual safety is located at the rear of receiver, above the stock. Feed is from detachable box magazine that holds 10 rounds, although the rifle is fitted with bolt hold-open device and can be reloaded using stripper clips with magazine in place. Sights are of open type, with range-adjustable u-notch rear and protected front.  Hakim rifle can be fitted with carrying sling and a detachable knife-type bayonet.

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

 Speer has earned its reputation primarily among law enforcement officers for exceptional reliability and performance. Speer dominates the LE market with their Gold Dot ammo and many law enforcement professionals like to shoot with similar power loads in their training ammo to get as close to the same recoil as their more expensive premium JHP duty ammo. This Speer Lawman ammo is designed specifically to meet this need for high quality training and target practice ammo.

 This ammo features a Total Metal Jacket bullet meaning that there is no exposed lead at the base of the bullet like standard FMJ bullets making this a great choice if you do most of your training at indoor ranges. This cartridge is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, and reloadable.

*Due to the OVERWHELMING demand for ammo and the fact that ALL online sources are sold out, most stores are and when they do have 9mm in you are limited to 2 boxes i will be selling all 1000rds (20 boxes of 50rds) for $500.

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

My membership is up for renewal at the end of the month and I was thinking about selling it. A new membership costs $350 (one time fee) and then $35 per month. If you pay the monthly fees in full at the beginning of the year you get one month free. 
I can transfer my membership for a $50 fee. I'd be willing to sell you my membership if you pay me the $350 and you pay triggertime the $50 transfer fee. This would cover your one-time cost and then you could pay monthly. There is currently a 6 to 9 month waiting list to get into the club. They have 11 25-yard lanes and 7 100-yard lanes.

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

I have money wrapped up in this so my price is firm at $500. I accept paypal and will pay for the shipping so no one is traveling. Once the payment is received it will be shipped. I will also accept trades on tactical shotguns that are lightly used or a good hand gun of similar price. I am open to most guns and if your looking to sell one and it is more than this and your looking for a good AR set up I can pay the difference. If you want to trade we will work out shipment and FFL stuff as I am located in NC.
