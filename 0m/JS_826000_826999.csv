Hi the other day I happened to get lucky and grab 10 Promags for the Ruger 10/22 at the local Bass Pro Shop that hold 32 rounds of .22 ammo for the rifle. My intentions were to use these at the range so i didn't have to spend 60% of my time reloading my Ruger. 

(Unfortunately it takes 30 seconds to shoot 10 rounds and 2 mins to reload it, can be annoying at times.)

Here they are on the site $24.99 I paid plus tax

Model 700 Stainless R5 Mil-Spec
Black Stock w/ Green Webbing
This is a great rifle and personal favorite of the local long range 308 crowd.
Features a M700 stainless steel barreled action with a 24 inch R5 mil-spec barrel, the same barrel used in the M-24 sniper rifles. Varmint barrel with 11.25 inch twist rate with five lands and grooves and eleven degree target crown. Stock has aluminum bedding in block in standard VS configuration.

""Offering this Model 700 for ten years is a testimony to the popularity and acceptance by shooters wanting to own an exceptionally accurate rifle at a reasonable price,"" states Category Manager, Dave Regula. At the core of the 700 with 5-R Rifling is the machined stainless steel, cylindrical Model 700 receiver design ensuring uniformity, strength and solid bedding area. Unique to this precision rifle is the 24-inch stainless steel, heavy barrel featuring 5-R Tactical Rifling -- the same hammer-forged barrel used on the M-24 sniper rifles.

 The 5-R Rifling barrel features five lands with a right hand twist which allows for less bearing surface on the bullet for slightly increased velocity.

As a result of less bullet drag, copper fouling in the bore is reduced ensuring long-term accuracy and consistency. The barrel is offered with a 110 target-style crown and a 1 in 11.25-inch twist.

The rock-solid barreled action is full-length, aluminum bedded into a well-designed H-S Precision stock for enhanced stability and shot-to-shot consistency. Add Remington's X-Mark Pro® externally adjustable trigger, designed to ""break-like-glass"" and set at 3.5 pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical-like accuracy."

Manufactured from 1988-1990 for US import 

If you want one buy it NOW before it is too late!! As you know only 180 or so of these ""evil looking"" shotguns were imported in the 1980s before being banned. Enough said
The SPAS-12 was designed by the Italian company Luigi Franchi Spa as a special purpose, military and police close combat weapon (actually, SPAS stands for Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun, or Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun, depending on the source). It featured a selective action for greater versatility, and can be used as a gas operated semi-automatic repeater or as a manually operated pump action repeater, depending on the mission and ammunition used. Since its introduction SPAS-12 became a very popular police and special-forces weapon, being versatile, reliable and with good firepower. On the other hand, it is heavier than most other similar shotguns and quite complicated, which results in relatively high prices.

SPAS-12 utilizes somewhat traditional for shotguns gas system with annular gas piston locating around the under barrel magazine tube. It operates the bolt with vertically tilting locking lug that engages the barrel extension to lock.SPAS-12 can be switched between gas operated self-loading mode and manually operated pump mode by pressing and holding a button at the bottom of the forearm and pulling the forearm slightly forward for AUTOMATIC mode or backward for PUMP(or MANUAL) mode. Earlier models of the SPAS-12 had the lever type safety at the front of the trigger guard, but due to some deficiencies this was latter replaced by the push-button (cross-bolt) safety at the same place. 
SPAS-12 could be fitted with stamped metallic butt-stock that folds to the top of the receiver when not in use, and with a pistol grip made of plastic. Alternatively, solid plastic butts-tocks with pistol grips are available. Barrel has cylinder bore with screw-on muzzle devices (cokes of flash hiders). Sights usually are of rifle type, with post front and open notch rear sight.

Additional Charges 
Must pay both FFL dealer charges, shipping and insurance cost. Rifles/shotguns will be shipped either pre-paid or COD. Handguns will only be shipped pre-paid.

Bushmaster Dissipator Carbine AR 15 Rifles



The Bushmaster Dissipator Carbine AR 15 rifles are specifically configured to disperse hot gases and making shooting easier. With your choice of a Solid Stock or TeleStock, all models have 16” heavy profile barrels and are chrome lined in both chamber and bore for seriously long-lasting reliability. Chambered for the .223 Remington round, these rifles can also handle the powerful and popular 5.56mm NATO cartridge.

Tapco stock with bottom rail. Stock is dark earth and painted, but paint is easy to remove. Perforated steel handguard attached in an atypical manner, but solid. Comes with Tapco buttstock and Magpul MOE buttstock, both of which fit. Accepts detachable, high-cap magazines. One STEEL 30 round magazine is included, and I have one other for sale for $40. Both magazines are just about brand new. Also included is a black one-point bungee sling, new.

The rifle has the bolt modification so that the magazines can be removed or inserted when the bolt is closed. Bolt hold open tab is removed because it interfered with the magazines and caused jams, but can be replaced if you wish. It's a really cool rifle.

I have no idea how it shoots as I have never shot it, but the bore looks great. Do not expect the SKS to be a tack driver though. Very clean with smooth rifling. All metal parts are in nice condition.

Diamondback Firearms proudly presents the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."

This is the 41AE caliper version Very Rare and comes in hard plastic case and sleeve

If you want one buy it NOW before it is too late!! This is the Cadillac brand of UZI. Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Model B in 41AE caliber. It's been stored and is in excellent condition. The gun pictured may have a different serial number, but is a NIB Uzi.

In the world of AK type rifles THIS GUN IS VERY RARE.  you almost never see them come up for sale.  Not sure what the components are, but it has a standard AK receiver, NOT A WASR type.  Regardless, it's the way they come from CAI, so look it up online.  It has a threaded barrel and a Yugo type slant muzzle break installed.

Price is $1,100 OBO.  Things are crazy right now with the ban likely coming in just a week or two by executive order from Chairman Obama - the worst president in the history of the US.

This rifle is Chambered in 7.62 x 39 mm, it takes all standard AK mags. The very best thing about this bullpup is that the overall length is only 27"". That is just over the Federal long gun cut off of “more than 26” and allows you to carry the rifle with much greater mobility. This configuration allows close quarters tactical use. Perfect for Law Enforcement, Military or Home Defense. The gun can be fired “from the hip” or from the shoulder without having to fold or unfold it to fire. It’s always 27” and always ready to fire. All high capacity magazines will clear the pistol grip. Bullpup stocks cannot be fired in a left handed position and are therefore only suitable for right handed shooters.

Buyer must sign a ""Buyer's Statement"" attesting to his or her legal ability to possess firearms in the State of Colorado. I will need to have you provide your Colorado driver's licence information prior to meeting for the sale. I will need this to prepare the buyer's statement form. You will receive a copy for your own records.  You must show your valid Colorado Driver's License to me at the time of sale.  

I reserve to right to decline sale to anyone that doesn't seem fit to have a gun, even if they are able to sign the statement.  CCW, active military, or law enforcement is greatly preferred, so they get a $50 instant rebate at time of sale.  Must have ID proving status."

Description 
If you want one buy it NOW before it is too late!! This is the Cadillac brand of UZI. Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Pistol Model in 9mm. It's been stored and is in excellent condition. The gun pictured may have a different serial number, but is a NIB Uzi. 
The UZI pistol was developed by Israel Military Industries (now IWI Ltd) during early 1980s from the famous Micro-UZI submachine gun. Intended users for the UZI pistol were various security agencies and services which wanted a high-capacity semi-automatic pistol, and civilian shooters (mostly in USA) which also wanted such gun with ""cool Uzi style"". Despite somewhat rough appearance UZI pistols were reliable and quite accurate. It also must be noted that 'original' UZI pistols should not be confused with full-size weapons based on semi-automatic only full-size Uzi carbines but without the shoulder stock. 
UZI pistol is blowback-operated semi-automatic weapon which fires from closed bolt. It has a stamped steel receiver and the bolt is fully enclosed inside. Bolt is of 'telescoped' design, that is, it is hollow in the front and encloses the rear part of the barrel when in battery. Uzi pistol has a single action trigger and utilizes an internal sliding striker (firing pin). Manual safety of sliding type, and is located above the grip on the left side of the gun. Magazines are of double stack design, interchangeable with other guns of Uzi family (in 9mm caliber). Sights are of open type, with flip-up rear sight, adjustable for windage.
Details:
• Semi-auto carbine
• 4.5"" barrel
• Baked enamel black finish over phosphated (parkerized) base

This is the Cadillac brand of UZI’s. Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Model B in 9mm. It's been stored and is in excellent condition. The gun pictured may have a different serial number, but is a NIB Uzi.

AR-15 Magwell Extension and Grip

The Gripwell gives the operator an advantage in CQB over the ""traditional"" vertical foregrip. This is accomplished by using a super tight vertical grip which produce a natural tendency to keep the elbow in tight. This in turn keeps the operator small and from making accidental contact with other entry team members or hitting objects causing an accidental ""sweeping"" of a team mate.

All the rest are reloaded cartridges and all appear to be the same. These are all 160 gr. 280 Remington and are in plastic ammo holder cases that hold 20 bullets each. Plastic cases are also included and do have lids for most of them. There is a total of 149rds all together. This ammo is fairly expensive(1.50 per round+) All clean ammo ready to shoot. Cash only-No trades. Pick up in Commerce Township or will meet nearby me. Thanks for your interest. Price is $100.00 or a fair offer will be considered.

You can pay with a Certified Check or a Postal Money Order. I will accept a personal check but this usually has a wait time to process and clear the bank. I can take Credit Cards. There is a 3% up-charge and processing fee for Credit Cards added to the sale price including the shipping for this transaction. You will have to call me with your credit card information. If you live in Washington State you will have to pay 8.6% Sales Tax. Price I am asking is $379.00. This is a very nice gun, with a clean barrel. Action works very smooth. Shipping is USPS Priority Mail, $26.00, FedEx and UPS, $36.00.

You can travel to Vashon and buy direct if you would like to.

Specifics, I will not ship to CA, MD, Hawaii, NY, DC, NJ, MA, and now Colorado after their crap, or some cities in Illibnois. Sorry not my fault. If you want this firearm it is your responsibility to know wether you are legal to own it, know the laws of your area, local, city, State, and Federal. If this firearm is not legal for you to own or not legal to own in your area you will be charged a 25% re-stocking fee if your dealer can not transfer to you and it has to be returned. Again not my fault. You will pay shipping to and from.

Call me and ask any and all questions before you buy. Please call me, Brad, at REDACTED, (Best to call), or e-mail. I will try to get back to you ASAP."

You can travel to Vashon and buy direct if you would like to.

Specifics, I will not ship to CA, MD, Hawaii, NY, DC, NJ, MA, and now Colorado after their crap, or some cities in Illibnois. Sorry not my fault. If you want this firearm it is your responsibility to know wether you are legal to own it, know the laws of your area, local, city, State, and Federal. If this firearm is not legal for you to own or not legal to own in your area you will be charged a 25% re-stocking fee if your dealer can not transfer to you and it has to be returned. Again not my fault. You will pay shipping to and from.

Call me and ask any and all questions before you buy. Please call me, Brad, at REDACTED, (Best to call), or e-mail. I will try to get back to you ASAP."

Magpul MOE Furniture.
1 Loaded 30 round Magpul PMAG included.
Details on Upper:
Barrel:  A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a Mid-length gas system.   The A2 lighter weight profile barrel allows for better balance and portability over the standard A2 profile and is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.  Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider.  This is not a ""pencil"" barrel.
Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring T-marks, but no logo, these upper upper receivers are made for us right here in the USA.
Each upper is assembled to order with US-made parts, and test fired to check gas function.

Gun is new, Has been test fired by me to confirm proper function.
Price is OBO, Will consider Gen 4 Glock 17 or 19 as partial trade.
