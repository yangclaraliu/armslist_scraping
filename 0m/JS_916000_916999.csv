This line of rifles is among the first to come stock with polymer receiver, making it 40% lighter and more shock resistant than a standard aluminum receiver. The slim pencil style barrel, low profile gas block, and CAR-15 style stock only enhance what is already one of the lightest and most maneuverable AR's on the market. The included red dot scope is light, simple and reliable while the sight allows the user to quickly aim the weapon in any situation.

These are scarce right now and most places are not taking backorders after the Kalashnikov plant shut down in Russia.  It is my understanding that any Saiga's that are in containers waiting to come into the USA are the last that we will ever get.  

I purchased this one because it is very unique, I *think* it is a 1993 model and the only I have ever seen stamped ""Kalashnikov USA"" as the importer, so this is likely Pre-Ban.  Furthermore, this particular one takes AK-47 mags straight from the factory without removing any metal or other modifications.  It also accepts the proprietary Saiga mags.

Essentially, this is ban proof in my opinion.  You can leave the 5 round on it and be legal in all 50 states even after a ""Assault weapons Ban"".  Or put the 30 round in, customize the configuration to your preference and you have the baddest AK on the market!

IMPORTANT NOTE! You must go through an FFL (even if local) which means an additional $30 paid to the FFL for the background check. I do have an FFL in Black Forest (Lockburner Firearms) that I trust who can do this transfer, or we can use yours if you have one. 

This line of rifles is among the first to come stock with polymer receiver, making it 40% lighter and more shock resistant than a standard aluminum receiver. The slim pencil style barrel, low profile gas block, and CAR-15 style stock only enhance what is already one of the lightest and most maneuverable AR's on the market. The included red dot scope is light, simple and reliable while the sight allows the user to quickly aim the weapon in any situation.

A little more about the rifle:

One of Bushmaster's most popular carbine models, the M4 Type features a distinctive military barrel profile and a six-position telestock, making it great for 3-gun match shooting, home defense, and law-enforcement use. The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome-lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a birdcage-type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling. The telestock, pistol grip, and two-piece handguards are all molded of strong, black thermoset composite material and the handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16-A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. Includes a 30-round magazine, a detachable carry handle, and a hard case."

It comes with the original hard Bushmaster case, original 30 round magazine and one additional 30 round metal magazine. I am including the scope and mount, which are an NC star illuminated reticle scope and Leopold see through mount.  They are easily removable and never need to be re-zeroed. I am including an Otis AR-15 cleaning kit, and the original sling.  The gun is pretty much factory except for the front sight, and pistol grip with hidden compartment.  I will include both factory parts if you would like to put it back to stock condition.  I have almost 1000 rounds to include with it, over 800 of which are Wolf 62 grain FMJ, which my gun shoots very well, and at least 80 hunting rounds 55 grain soft point.

This is the older Bushmaster, made before the company was sold and they started using cheaper parts.  It has never jammed, or had any issues with FTF, FTE, or anything.  It has worked flawlessly for every one of the probably 1200 or so rounds I have fired through it, and is very accurate. It has been cleaned after every time it has been fired, and there is not a scratch on it.  I take care of all my guns and they have been kept in my safe.  

I do not NEED the money, so low balling will not work.  The only trades that I would consider would be a Ruger 10/22 in any condition, or Ruger .44 Magnum carbine plus cash.  I also like gold and silver bullion.  I’m not interested in separating anything, as Id like to sell the ammo with the gun.  

I am sure there is something I am leaving out of this ad, so if you have any questions or would like to see more pictures please feel free to text: Eric at REDACTED

I own a business in North Charleston, that is a very safe place to do the transaction, I will need to do a bill of sale and get a copy of ID."

The CS model is Marlin's high-end 30-30, with nicer black walnut stock and better fit and finish on the metal and wood parts, cap on the bottom of the pistol grip and target in the bottom of the stock. You would have to get a custom built Marlin 336 to find a nicer one than this.

It is old enough to have been made in the Marlin plant but still new enough to have checkering on the stock and forend. 

It is a well-known fact among lever-gun enthusiasts that the new Marlins, built in the Remington plant are complete junk. Do some research on the web and you will see what I mean. This is not one of those. This 336 has the (JM) roll stamp on the barrel, which is the mark of the Marlin plant.

I am only selling to fund other projects. Price is $550 and includes a Marlin 3-9 X 40 scope, base and rings which are not currently mounted.

This gun was in the collection of a Jewelry store many years ago in this town sitting in the case pictured and now after all these years is up for sale. These guns are a unique ""swing breech"" design patented by George H Fox and were manufactured between the years 1870-1884 with a low production of possibly less than 5,000 according to some sources. They came in either 10 Gauge or 12 Gauge and lengths of barrels measured 26, 28, 30 and 32. This gun has a barrel length of 28 and I was told is in 12 Gauge. The stock is cracked and I did not remove the tape to see how bad but I assume it will need repaired or replaced. The barrel is clean on the outside with only a minor ding towards the end and the bore of the shotgun does have some surface rust and pitting. I did not attempt to clean and feel that should be left more for the professional. Action works smooth and locks up tight, hammers cock and activate as they should and the gun still presents very well and is a great conversation piece. These guns sell for very high dollar and have a high book. I am offering this gun for $500 which I think is fair to the collector of interesting and unique historical firearms. The Red Head gun case that the rifle was found in, comes with it. Buyer will pay all shipping fees and please email with any additional questions you may have or request for pics. Gun is an antique and is safe to ship but please know your local laws regarding antiques. Gun should not be fired unless checked out by a competent gunsmith."

Steyr M95
8x56r
Matching numbers
Clean bore
accurate as heck
Rear sight has elevation adjustment, (marked in Schritten, 1 Schritten is approx 2ft.)
Rifle comes with an original sling
Bayonet, with scabbard, (not the greatest shape, good steel, but the guy I bought it from used a grinder on it, so it needs to be cleaned up.)
2.5 boxes of surplus ammo, (25 rounds, 5 clips)
~20 reusable clips (normally sell for $3-$5 each by themselves)
nearly 50 brass that ARE reloadable, new manufacture brass.
Shoots beautifully

Steyr 1911 (made in 1915)
9mm Steyr, (NOT the same as 9mm para, 9mm Largo, .38 super, though it is a variation of 9x23)
Re-blued by a professional
Comes with original wood grips, as well as modern polymer replacements
8 clips, (yes, it is a clip fed pistol)
12 rounds of new manufacture ammo, plus the spent brass I was able to find.
~450 rounds of surplus 9mm Steyr, apparently made sometime in the 30's, (no guarantees that it will fire, some worked, but chances are they more than likely wont work, but they are included at component prices, so pull the bullets and load them into 9mm, .380, or other .357 cal rounds)
This gun also shoots fairly well. Works best on a cold barrel.

Overall Condition: This revolver retains about 50% of its metal finish. The top of the front and rear sights show wear. The front half of the barrel shows wear and thinning, as does the cylinder.

Our Assessment: While the outside of this revolver is less than pristine, the bore is good, and the cylinder lockup is GREAT. This revolver ought to be a tack-driver.
