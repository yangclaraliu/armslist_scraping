This is the Remington 870 that is able to fire 2 3/4, 3, and 3 1/2 inch shells. 

 I bought it new approximately 1 year ago.  I have fired around 150 rounds through it.  No rounds have been fired through the 28 inch ribbed barrel.  I bought a short 18 1/2 inch barrel which is the only barrel that the gun has been fired with.  I will consider selling the gun with both barrels for a higher cost.  The gun has all synthetic stocks, and the factory 28 inch barrel has a removable modified choke.  I still have the box and all of the factory books, trigger lock, capacity plug, choke remover, and accessories for the gun.  It is also possible to mount a sling on this shotgun.  The gun shows little wear on the finish around the action from use.  It has never been hunted with.  Just taken out several times to target shoot.  I bought the Super Mag in hopes that I could used the 3 1/2 inch option for goose hunting but did not get out this year.  I am willing to sell or trade.  

What I am looking for in a trade would be of equal value of the following.

I will sell the shotgun with factory long (28 inch) barrel with box, all of the factory stuff for $300 firm.

I am willing to sell the shotgun with both barrels ( regular plus 18 1/2 inch Remington made home defense short barrel) for $400 firm.

I am also willing to sell the shotgun, both barrels, and 487 rounds of 12 gauge ammo from $550 firm.  

This ammo has approximately 173 rounds of 00 buckshot, 20 rounds of 00 buckshot/slug combo, 10 rounds of rubber 00 buckshot, 29 rifled slugs, 125 rounds of lead bird shot, and 70 rounds of steel bird shot.

Everything about this weapon is great, less some rust on the dustcover (a minor place to have rust) and a scratch on the right of the receiver. There are some very minor ""smudges"" in the parkerizing, typical for older guns of this type. 

The bore is chromed and in perfect shape and it has been cleaned regularly after shooting. This is a great opportunity to own a real collectors item.

The Saiga rifle is manufactured by IZHMASH in Russia, making it the closest you can get in the United States to a real Russian AK-47.
THE SAIGA IS AN AUTOLOADING RIFLE with a hunting buttstock and fore end (plastic). The Saiga rifles are intended for hunting big and medium-sized game under different climatic conditions. The rifles are developed on the base of the venerable Kalashnikov assault rifle and chambered for 7.62x39, . 223 Rem (5.56x45), and 5.45x39 cartridges.

I'd estimate the rifle's value conservatively at $725,  The extras conservatively, (lowest price, not including taxes and shipping) at $500, coming to $1225.  Im looking to get $1075 for this package. Please feel free to make an offer, but I am not desperate to sell this rifle, so lowballs will be ignored.  You can email me or call/text 414-248-97fournine with any questions.  Trades will be considered, but I am particular with what I am interested in. Only looking to do local FTF transactions at this time, but would be willing to travel a reasonable distance within WI.  Buyer must be able to verify they are 21 years of age.

If you're worried about the cost of GAP ammo, go to SGAmmo, it's the same price as ACP, you just get the benefit of the slim grip, less muzzle flash and softer recoil!

I am not the original owner, but the rifle seems to be in very good condition.  I picked up in a trade a couple years ago, but have not since fired it.  The trigger on this rifle seems excellent, and rifle feels very robust, as Norincos have a beefed up receiver compared to many other AK rifles.  It also is a ""straight"" cut rear receiver, which tends to be more desirable than some of the slant cut models.  The original furniture is included, but it is currently wearing an Advanced Technology stock. http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=741262&WT.tsrc=CSE&WT.mc_id=GoogleBaseUSA&WT.z_mc_id1=741262&rid=40&mr:trackingCode=7C7E9052-F5D2-DF11-82EF-001B21631C34&mr:referralID=NA#BVRRWidgetID

It comes with a B-square Weaver Style screw on scope mount. However, it does not have the scope rings. http://www.midwayusa.com/product/583331/b-square-military-weaver-style-scope-base-with-1-rings-ak-47-and-mak-90-receiver-mount-gloss?cm_mmc=Froogle-_-Optics+-+Scope+Rings%2c+Bases%2c+Mounting+%26+Accessories-_-PriceCompListing-_-583331

I also added a Tromix extended bolt handle.  http://store.carolinashooterssupply.com/servlet/-strse-266/Tromix-Saiga-Ak47-extended/Detail

Im asking $600 for this rifle. It seems to be a great rifle, and I am only selling because I am getting out of AK's at this time. Sorry about the cameraphone pic, but its all I have to work with right now. Email or call/text 414-248-97fournine with questions.  I am only interested in local FTF transactions in WI at this time, but would be willing to travel a reasonable distance to meet within WI.  Buyer will need WI ID.  Will consider trades, but I am particular with what I will accept.

I bought rifle used from a previous owner who stated it has less that 250 rounds through it.  I have owned it for about a year, and have added the upgrades, but have not personally fired the rifle myself. I have the original manual, but not the cleaning kit or box. It is in very good condition, the only thing worth noting is that I did mar up the finish a little around the left side of the front sight post while trying to replace the front sight with a cheap tool, but it is easily touched up.  Here are the specs.

THE SAIGA 100 IS AN AUTOLOADING RIFLE with a plastic buttstock. The fore end consists of two plastic guards, receiver cover is made of the reinforced plastic, the receiver is closed with plastic housing, the buttontype safety, 3-round magazine. The Saiga-.308 ver. 102 is an autoloading rifle with a plastic buttstock and fore end. The receiver cover is made of the reinforced plastic, it is closed with a plastic housing, the button-type safety, 3-round magazine. 
The Saiga, 100 series autoloading hunting rifle features a classic hunting design. In fact the rifles of new series keep the principle of operation and design of the main mechanisms that of the Saiga rifles, the high reliability of which is corroborated by their long-term usage in various environments. The rifles are chambered for the following calibers: 308Win (7.62x51); 30-06(7.62x63).

Great rifle, only selling because I'm getting out of AK's at this time. I'd estimate the rifles value to be around $550, plus conservatively (lowest available price, no tax, no shipping) about $615 in extras, coming to $1165.  Im looking to get $900 for this package. Please feel free to make an offer, but I am not desperate to sell this rifle, so lowballs will be ignored.  You can email me or call/text 414-248-97fournine with any questions.  Trades will be considered, but I am particular with what I am interested in. Only looking to do local FTF transactions at this time, but would be willing to travel a reasonable distance within WI.  Buyer must be able to verify they are 21 years of age.

This is a serious rifle for serious shooters, not a ""let's go blow up some old appliances up inb Lefthand Canyon"" rifle...

Almost new (bought a month ago) Arsenal SGL-31 5.45x39 with less than 200 rounds through it. This is NOT a run-of-the-mill Romanian kit built by the drunken monkeys at Century! You cannot buy a better AK platform unless you step WAY up to the Rifle Dynamics/TSD/Krebs Custom AK builds.  Arsenal builds these rifles on Saiga receivers manufactured at the Izmash factory in Russia, using brand-new Russian parts with the exception of required US parts for 922r compliance. Chrome-lined barrel, two-stage trigger, poly stock and handguards, ten-round Izmash magazine,1000 meter graduated rear sight leaf. The only modification I made is the addition of a Hogue pistol grip, which is a fanatstic upgrade over the skinny, slippery standard AK grip.  The AR fanboys will tell you ""the AK is known for being inaccurate"", but accuracy starts with build quality. The 5.45x39 round is excellent, and with iron sights and surplus ammo, I shot five shot groups of 2-inches at 100 yards. With a Leatherwood HiLux CMR 1x4 scope and Hornady VMAX ammo, this rifle rang the steel at 300 yards with boring ease, averaging 5-inch groups!

But, we have several AK variants and they are all in 7.62x39.  In order to keep ammo commonality, this one is getting the boot and somebody else is getting a great rifle.  I paid $945 after taxes and fees plus the Hogue pistol grip, and am firm on the $875 asking price, no haggling. Will include all original literature and packaging from Arsenal, including test target, manuals and certifications.

This is a sweet pistol, target sights are amazing and easy to aquire, great sight picture. The trigger is smooth, clean breaking, short reset, but there are some incredible aftermarket trigers out there for under $100 if you are so inclined. Just for kicks, I shot this pistol at the 12-inch steel from 100 yards, and was averaging about six hits out of ten, a better shooter could have probably figured the holdover a little better and run ten for ten all day

I'm selling it because as nice as it it, I am a John Moses Browning guy.  I swore I'd never own a polymer gun, never let the Glock guys win.  But the XDM finally sucked me in... And while it has changed my view on polymer pistols (not completely, the Glock is still an ergonomic nightmare and an ugly, souless pstol), I just cant get away from my love of 1911s and and Hi-Powers.  Which brings me to the trade:

Will trade for a CZ-75B and cash.  Black, polycoat, 9mm, non-decocker. A clean used CZ-75 runs around $475.00, so I'd be looking for some cash as well, but lets talk."

The truck has some wear and tear, scratches and dings. It has a larger dent on the drivers side near the rear behind the tire, all thanks to my neighbor. Also the pasenger side mirror was cracked and fell out. So, I just replaced it with a dome mirror. Other than those couple things its in real good condition.

From the maker:
This holster sits inside the waistband and has a metal clip to hold the rig in the pants securely. We had this design built with a steel band in the double re-inforced top that makes this Stay Open Top easy for one handed reholstering.  Originally, we had our builder make this holster specifically for the Ruger LCR as we couldn't find any leather holsters to fit that pistol. We found it works great for all the J-Frame Smiths (5-shot revolvers) and the Colt .38 Specials too.

I have fired about 400 rounds through this conversion since purchasing it new about 9 years ago. It is in very good condition with no scratches, rust or damage. On my gun it functioned perfectly with CCI Mini Mags and similar better quality ammunition. The conversion performed reasonably well with cheap bulk ammunition aside from the occasional fail to eject due to weak ammunition. It performs best when the gun slide is well oiled. The rear sight is dove tailed so it might be drift adjustable. I never attempted to adjust it because I found its point of aim to be pretty accurate.

MAG.  Remarkably accurate and has less than 2 boxes of Remington Core Lokt through it.  No rust, scratches, pitting, etc.  Like new, w/manuals.  I take care of my guns and you won't find a cleaner used one.  Even the bolt could pass for brand new.  Has taken several deer (dropped on contact) and standing I can shoot 4"" patterns at 100 yards all day.  6"" at 200 yards.  Off the bench w/Nikon Buckmaster 40mm scope it shoots 1.5"" - 2"" MOA at 100 yds.  (sorry, keeping the Nikon, but it comes w/the stock Simmons 3x9 which I just bore sighted and I'll throw in a $30 box of Core Lokt ammo that I have left).  Love the trigger on this particular rifle.  Recent shoulder surgery on my right arm is the ONLY reason I'm selling.  Can't deal with the recoil of this arm cannon anymore.  If you want a ""new"" one, come get mine and save $200.  Exact same gun is $570 on Cheaper Than Dirt.com without scope.  Would like to sell or would trade for similar smaller caliber rifle with less recoil."

Sorry no pictures and I do not even own a digital camera and my cell phone only makes phone calls, so please don't ask. If you are reading this then it is still for sale as I will remove the ad as soon as a sale is made so please don't ask if it is ""still available"" as if you are reading this ad then it is, thanks."

ATI's newest addition is the GSG-5P, a pistol chambered in .22LR and based off of their GSG-5 rifle of the same caliber. The GSG-5P is basically a chopped down GSG-5, with all the same durable synthetic material and reliable internals. The GSG-5 has quickly sparked the interest of all .22LR shooters as the highest quality MP-5 clone to date, and the GSG-5P follows right along the same track as the pistol version of the same build. The GSG-5P takes the same magazines as the GSG-5,

The weapon is in excellent, as-new condition with pristine paint and nice wood furniture.  It may never have been fired — it's that clean.  This is an American-made version of the Spanish CETME main battle rifle, and is very similar in function to the Heckler & Koch G3 and HK-91 rifles.  In fact, some parts may interchange, though honestly, that's a little beyond what I'm certain of.  It is chambered for the .308 Winchester = 7.62x51 NATO cartridge.  These weapons operate by delayed blowback, so there is no gas fouling in the receiver.

The hooded front sight post is adjustable for elevation, and the rear sight consists of three apertures and one notch, selectable for range, mounted on a spindle that adjusts for windage.  If a scope mount is desired, there are several designs for these weapons that mount on lugs that are part of the top spine of the receiver.

Included with the sale will be the sling shown that I believe was originally included with the new weapon, as well as a bayonet adapter, and an original Spanish CETME bayonet with scabbard. Also included will be nine 20-round magazines, a belt pouch capable of holding four magazines and a chest pouch with six pockets that can each hold two magazines.

All this can be yours for only $625!

I prefer a face-to-face transaction in the San Antonio area, but I am willing to travel a reasonable distance to meet a willing buyer. I will be happy to make it available for inspection to any serious potential buyer, but it will be helpful if you ask questions in advance, so I can satisfy any concerns and add additional information and pictures here if relevant.  When you're ready to buy, please be prepared to show proof of Texas residence, sign a bill of sale, and come with cash in hand.

I am willing to ship it to an out-of-state buyer given advance payment for the purchase and shipping, and we handle the transfer legally."

It originally came with the black synthetic stock (which I still have), but it was too short for me, so I bought the ATI adjustable folding stock with pistol grip. It has since been painted digital urban camo with duracoat, and looks great. Also has the SOCOM accu-strut on the barrel. It really does improve the accuracy and tightens up your grouping. Has a UTG bipod on it as well. Primary Arms Red-Dot sight.  It comes with 3 ruger factory 20 round mags, and original stock. 

Round count is around 200. Only about 100 of those with the new stock installed. 

The serial number dates it to around a 2008 build date. 

It's a great shooting gun, but I've had my fun with it, now I'm looking for something different.

Here's a breakdown of what I have into the gun as a reference:

Gun itself: $650
Stock w/ custom duracoat paint: $275
Accu-Strut Socom barrel stablizer: $120
UTG Bi-pod: $20
Primary Arms M-4(Aimpoint Clone): $100
Spare Ruger factory 20rd. mags: $30 each

I have right around $1200 into this gun. I don't expect to get all of my money out of it, but at the same time, I'm not going to give it away. I'm no longer looking for trades, I'd like to sell it to help fund a boat project. 

Looking for $900 or best offer. I think this is a very fair price compared to other mini-14's that I've seen."

I have a recently purchased SIG SAUER® Mosquito (last summer) with a threaded barrel (M9 x 0.75).  Features include a rugged blowback system, fixed barrel and adjustable sights.  Ambidextrous manual slide mounted safety, magazine safety and internal locking device. The Threaded Barrel Adapter facilitates the mounting of accessories requiring a ½ x 28 thread pattern, including many popular sound suppression devices.  I’m not into sound suppressors and I’m not a SIG P226 guy (prefer Glock’s and 1911’s). 

Looking to see what is out there in terms of a trade.  I’m looking at .22lr for .22lr and not interested in anything cheap, looking for a fair deal.  These pistols go for $375 and up new and $325 and up used.  I am the original owner and I’ve put 500+ rounds through this pistol.  

I’m interested in 1911 .22lr, S&W M&P .22lr, Walther P22, etc., let me know what you’re looking to trade.

If you are not familiar, this model is the predecessor to the current 85 FS Cheetah. Though the mechanics of the guns are identical (DA/SA, single stack .380 autos with ambi safety), the 85 BB sports classic Italian lines with a traditional round trigger guard & a charcoal blued finish.

The pistol comes with the following items:
- Two Beretta factory magazines
- Original black plastic grips
- Beretta factory walnut grips
- Italian Bianchi IWB holster
- Hard sided case
- 50 rds of Federal range ammunition
- Approximately 25 rounds of Federal Hydra-Shok JHPs

This Beretta 85 BB is in excellent condition. It is reliable, concealable & a pleasure to shoot. It's slim lines & compact dimensions make it a fantastic concealed carry piece for both men & women. I am selling it to fund the purchase of a home defense shotgun because right now I cannot afford to keep a gun that I like, but don't use.

Photos are available upon request.

Price: $525 Or Near Offers

I will be in the Bellevue/Seattle area 3/23-3/26 & will have the pistol with me if it has not already sold.
