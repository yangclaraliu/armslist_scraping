I've got some lower receivers I purchased and had them shipped to my dealer but my plans have changed. You'll need to either pick them up in person in Bonney Lake and fill out the paperwork, or have them shipped to your FFL. 
$105 each plus tax( and shipping if applicable). They're model M15SA lowers, these have never been assembled making them an option for AR pistols. LRB makes great quality products. Ready for your lower parts kit to be installed.  Here's what LRB has to say about these lowers. 

""Our semi auto LRB ARMS M15SA lower receiver and flattop uppers are made from aircraft grade 7075-T6 aluminum forgings same as currently used by US military. The forgings are CNC machined on the same state of the art equipment which manufactures our M14SA receivers with tolerances held to one thousandth of an inch. Finish is a hard coat anodize per MIL-A-8625. Our receivers accept all mil-spec internal parts and are compatable with all other manufacturers mil-spec upper and lower receivers. Made in USA."""

Single shot, bolt action, .22 caliber short long and extra long, 100 years old, original finish in nice shape for the age (just darkened from age so you can tell it is much older than some of these 1940s 1902 models on here), Fired it once to test it out and it works well with great accuracy, never planned to shoot it just to collect it.

This was the boy scouts training rifle of the early 1900s and many were made so the value on them is 150-400 depending on condition so I don't expect the money value I have in it back, that being said it is in nice condition for the age.

I did the hard work of cleaning all of the cosmoline off the rifle.  These are conflict rifles used in Albania (more on that below.)  I cleaned all the grime off the stock, but was sure to keep the ""been there, done that"" look of the stock with all the dings and gashes. I applied about 10 coats of boiled linseed oil to seal and protect the stock.

The bore is chrome lined and excellent.  Almost looks brand new.  The bluing is intact and there's sights of light pitting in only a few of the areas.  The gas tube was a little rough, but I worked it a bit to smoothen it out and now the tube moves inside like glas. 

The history behind these latest batches of SKS's because they're the only Chinese SKS's that are C&R eligible and because where they were used. These came from the Balkans, most likely from Albania.  Some of the SKS's had initials and other trench art that points to Albania, with some of the rifles even having Albanian style SKS stocks and bolts.  This is also the reason why these batch of Chinese SKS's are C&R eligible.  You can read more about these latest imports at www.sksboards.com and click on the Chinese section of the forums.

I originally bought this with the intention of doing a bubba job and converting it into a bullpup.  However, I decided to keep it, as is.  With that said, money is short and out of my collection this is the one I'd probably shoot the least and has the least sentimental value, so it's up for sale now."

Estimated 3-4 hours to complete based on receiver instructions and YouTube build/walk through videos so you could do it in a weekend, also have a video the man who traded it to me sent of his AK-47 build being fired. 

When I say ""Real"" I mean it was in an overseas armory, broken down, cut, and shipped. This includes a real pistol grip worth 100$ individually, a real fore-grip worth 150$ individually, the original cleaning rod, matching bolt barrel original receiver halves and all original internals. A kit alone of this quality/style will go for 450+ online if you can find them in stock and I have seen such crazy prices as 900$ online for this kit.

I can't find a practical use for such a firearm but I enjoy IDPA shooting and firing my pistol at the local range so I will take some trades."

Barrett Firearms Semi-Automatic .50 BMG Rifle M82/M107CQ is the shorter 20” barrel rifle that is easier and lighter to carry around with no loss in accuracy because the barrel is chrome lined, very durable, and very accurate. It comes with Pelican air and water tight hard case. (This Barrett MSRP was $8,900.) The rifle comes with a Nightforce 5.5 x 22 x 56 NSX Scope, .250 MOA with NP-1RR Reticle which works on the principle of known target size to provide easy range-finding and quick, accurate compensation for wind drift and bullet drop. (Nightforce optics MSRP is $1,821 and Nightforce Rings Set MSRP was $170.) This rifle also comes with 2 extra 10-round magazines. (Barrett mag MSRP was $150 each.) Total MSRP for this CQ: $11,191. To give some idea of the value of this fine weapon, for a new Barrett Model 82A1 just like the one in the picture but with an inferior Leupold Scope and Rings and only one magazine, the MSRP is $10,270. As a bonus, additional ammo comes with this Barrett rifle: 2 Barrett 80-round Master Packs of .50 BMG 661 Grain M33 Ball (MSRP $760.00 - $380 each plus shipping.), 3 Summit 10-round boxes of.50 BMG 619 Grain APIT (MSRP of $112.47 - $37.49 each plus shipping.), 100-round linked .50 BMG 649 Grain API (MSRP of $320 plus shipping.), 184 miscellaneous loose rounds of .50 BMG AP, APIT and API - $368 at $2 each.) Total VAlue: MSRP .50 BMG Ammo Value: $1,560.47. Total Package MSRP Barrett .50 BMG Rifle plus accessories and added Ammo Value: $12,751.47. My price as a package deal: $7,900 for everything.

This is a full-sized 5"" barrel stainless DA/SA 10mm pistol with ambi decocker. Built like a tank and super reliable, the 1006 is widely considered to be the best 10mm automatic ever made.

Comes with 3 factory 9 rd mags, a shoulder rig (nylon, LH), roughly 100 rds of ammo (about 80 rds of Silvertip and 20 rds of CorBon hunting ammo), and a cleaning brush.

VERY LOW ROUND COUNT. A few light scuffs on the stainless finish from prior owner. I only put 50 rounds through it, prior owner said he only fired about 200 rounds.

This is a great pistol, but a bit heavy. I have close to $850 invested in this, let's say trade value of $750. Would be fine keeping it, but thinking about swapping it for something different.

Would be very interested in a DAO snub revolver chambered for .44 Special or .45 Colt. Would also be interested in a G36 slimline. No interest in other models of Glock, Charcos, .357s, or long guns."

The action works flawlessly and the blueing is in great shape. It has iron sights. Has had less than 100 rounds through it. It's a semi automatic. Was in a glass case for most of it's life. It shoots great, .30 caliber has good power and good accuracy. This comes with a full box of .30 cal ammo, about 800 to 1000 rounds worth, as well as a 30 rd mag and 2 15 or 20 rd magazines, not for sure how much they hold. This kind of gun was used in WWII, so has lots of history behind it. The value of the 2 of these combined is over $700 so this is a good deal, especially since they are becoming harder and harder to find. May trade for a 223 semi auto, mini 14, or a mini 30.

I have for sale a Kel-Tec P11 and 3 magazines for just $120. I was going to trade this in on another firearm and this is what the gun shop offered me for it. Instead of letting them turn a profit on it, I'd rather pass the savings on to you. This is a reliable CCW.

The individual that was traded with, sold or traded this rifle sometime in the early 1990s. There's a good chance that the rifle may still be in the Southern Oregon area. The serial number is somewhere between 140,000 - 150,000 (1948 manufacture date is my best guess)

Note: This rifle was given to my dad from my grandfather as a gift in late 1948-early 1949. I have a letter from the La Grande, Oregon gunsmith who did some custom work on it. In the letter he did mention that it ""has been styled with deluxe model stock having full pistol grip and beaver-tail forearm."" I remember the forearm in particular in that it had nice checkering and had a good ""fat"" feel. It also had a simple leather sling that was showing signs of wear. It has a 20"" carbine barrel."

It has had less than ten rounds through it and works great, I replaced it because I needed a barrel without the rifle sights.  I sent it to Remington before I replaced it to have it honed, they did a great job and it's now super shinny on the inside.  It comes without the sights as they have been pushed out, the posts however remain, so slide whatever you like in there.  I swear on my life that the last picture, inside the barrel is just dirt.  You want to see it clean either ask nicely or do it yourself.

This is rifle is a beast. It has the AK style upper with a AR lower. It has a left sided bolt on it, for tactical reloading. Folding stock w/ a 16"" heavy barrel.

Cleans supper fast, takes down quick. Uses common tools and you can adjust the gas setting with a bullet tip. You can also buy conversion kits that take less than 30 seconds to install, making this a versatile platform.

Takes all the AR mags, but prefers brass over steel case. It will shoot steel case, but like all ARs, it is a dirty powder and requires the gas block to be at highest setting. 

It does shoot the steel case accurately. Just runs smoother w/ brass.

It has:
Flip up sights
Hogue Grip
Rail Gaurds
UTG Aluminum Fore grip w/ battery storage.
One point Sling
Old style trigger group
New style gas block

Will throw in the cheap Sight Mark sight if you need it.

I am the second owner of this. The original owner passed away and son sold the rifle to me. He only put about 60 rounds through it, and i have put about 200 myself.

She is cleaned and oiled and the bolt cycles smoothly.

That's ~$0.568/round.  Retail is usually around ~$0.68/round or more.

All ammo is less than a year old. Will consider trades for .45 Auto ammo.

Since its only 44 rounds (less than 2 boxes of ammo) it may not be worth a drive, but if local its a good deal!

It has the 28"" barrel and also the Kick-Off hydraulic recoil system.  This is the best shotgun I have ever shot or owned.  It is in like-new condition with minimal cosmetic blemishes.  Shoots great and I have never had a problem with it.

Beretta's description of the shotgun:

Make no mistake, the Beretta Xtrema2 set the standard for all autoloaders. Others tried to follow, but the Xtrema2 remains the choice of serious waterfowlers. The truth is that that no other inertia or gas autoloader can match the Xtrema2 for corrosion protection, reliability, recoil reduction, and simplicity of maintenance. In fact, the Xtrema2 has more recoil reduction features than any other autoloading shotgun on the planet. It will pound out shot after shot, season after
season—even generation after generation. No wonder that in the relentless pursuit of excellence, our engineers set the benchmark for a “do-it-all” shotgun with the Xtrema2: - Shooting Illustrated’s “shotgun of the year.”
Gas Operation System with Exhaust Valve. The unique gas operation system, patented by Beretta, with self-cleaning gas cylinder and piston, is provided with a self cleaning exhaust valve that automatically vents the excess gases of the most powerful cartridges.The result is that the shotgun, without any adjustment, fires everything from the weakest 28g (1 ounce, 3 ¾ dram equivalent) game load to the heaviest 64g (2 ¼ ounce) Super Magnum cartridge. The exhaust valve remains attached to the barrel, ensuring easy and quick assembly and disassembly of the shotgun.

Using accelerated salt-spray testing, the unprotected steel barrel section (top) shows corrosive effects, whereas the Aqua Technology–protected barrel (bottom) looks brand new. In fact, the Xtrema2 is the only gun to have passed a 150-hour salt-spray test with no signs of corrosion. Also, all steel par ts are now manufactured from stainless steel or are plated with either: nickel, Bruniton, PVD, Aqua Film (receiver & barrel) or chrome (barrel, bore and bolt), making the Xtrema2 a match for even the most extreme environments.

Beretta’s new Kick-Off hydraulic dampening reduction system reduces recoil an astounding 44% more than its closest rival by using two hydraulic recoil dampers incorporated into the stock “spacer” unit. The recoil energy is gradually dissipated by the hydraulic dampers, resulting in superior comfort for the shooter."

Rare hard to find. Savage as a trapper or survival rifle, the Savage 24C is designed as a take down combo rifle/shotgun that requires no tools whatsoever to take down. When Taken down, it measures a total of just 20""!!! That's how long the barrel is. The butt of the stock has a swinging plate installed over factory drilled holes for emergency shell storage. The lower barrel is chambered for 20 Ga 2 3/4"" and 3"" Shotgun shells. The top barrel is chambered for .22 LR (long rifle) both barrels are equipped with extractors. This gun is a great bush pilot gun and is equally well suited to be a kids starter gun, because it shoots both .22 LR and 20 Ga.

It was custom built originally with cherry oak stock.  I actually enjoyed deer hunting with the rifle so much that I took the stock off and put a synthetic on.  The original stock is not for sale.  The trigger has been custom built by the gunsmith... I don't know who the gunsmith is but you WILL NOT find a better feeling trigger.  The only reason I'm selling this is because I have to many bills that need to be paid and it's one of three guns I own that I no longer hardly ever use.  I will regret this in ten years but oh well.

It has a nitrex 3x10x50mm scope.  Nitrex was bought out by Leupold right at two years ago.  The scopes are Japanese glass and consist of Leupold and Weaver parts.  The scope was $320 brand new.... I'm putting a value of about $75 to a $100 on it in this ad.  I got it four years ago for Christmas.

Text me for pics.  It has a blued barrel.  Stock is black.  The barrel was bought back in the 90's, it's in excellent shape.  This gun puts any and all of the new model 700's to shame.  Like I said though, it's a little different because it was custom built.  It may be glass bedded as well, I'm not sure."
