I have a 9mm Taurus 709 Slim in Stainless finish. 
The gun has been shot about 300 rounds at an indoor range and has been maintained with great care as it was my carry pistol. I have never had a jam or failure to eject with the gun.
Plus, of course, the gun is covered entirely by Taurus's famous lifetime warranty and free repair policy.
I am only selling this gun because I was given a P99 for my birthday and despite loving my 709 Slim thoroughly we must part ways.

Also I will include a Fobus ankle holster specifically fit to the gun that I have worn for two weeks and it is honestly the most comfortable holster I have worn for concealment of any type.

This rifle was the first to be accorded a Yugo-specific model designation. As Yugoslavia did not have their own rifle production facilities until later on, the 1924 pattern Mauser rifle was manufactured under contract by FN (Fabrique National D'armes De Guerre, Herstal, Belgique) and BRNO.     

All were straight bolt rifles with the 'old style' long-type wood-handled Mauser bayonet, and all were produced prior to WWII. **Does NOT come with the bayonet.***

It is in good shape. I have 100+ rounds of ammunition to go with the gun.

Round count is unknown, although very low (I never got around to firing it, I've only had it a few months).

DA/SA, standard sig sights, stainless steel slide, no rail.

The gun is in excellent shape, the only marks being a tiny bit of holster wear on the left front of the slide and a small mark on top of the slide. Not sure where that came from.

I have the original gray Sig box and three magazines with it. For the right offer, I'll also include around 200 assorted rounds of range ammo (mostly PMC) and 50 rounds of PMC Starfire hollowpoints.

I'd like $600 for the gun and the ammo, $550 for just the gun.

Waited almost 4 months for the rifle. I had originally ordered what was then known as an SRT rifle, but after several phone calls, Darren called me and said that he would install one of their prototype barrels on an upper that would make it essentially a DMR platform. He sent me an email that I still have that explains that the barrel was made by Lothar-Walther with a polygonal bore and no M4 cuts. The profile is essentially an HBAR profile. Matt at NWT has one of these and will swear by it that it is a tack driver.

I had LWRC install a RRA two-stage trigger and a Vortex FH. Rifle has had no more than 380 round put through it (Mostly 22LR). I decided to keep this rifle as near mint since LWRC was moving to their new location to begin production of the 3rd gen rifles and thought this would be an excellent collector item some time in the future. However, the lady said if I want to purchase a new rifle, one has to go. The upper and lower are a pretty tight fit but I'm prepared to sell them separate."

I use a very fine glass bead media so no stamping or machine marks are distorted in any way. my prices are very fair and lower than anyone else i've ever heard of. as long as its not a reciever, the parts can be shipped to me and i'll ship them back after the parkerizing is complete. I do hold a valid FFL03 so anything falling under the C&R category can be shipped to me. many examples of my work can be seen on the CMP forums, as I mostly do park work on M1 Garands and M1 Carbine parts. I can do any gun though, not limited to the old US military rifles, I just do a lot of them.

I also do powder coating on pretty much anything, but i try to avoid powder coating any gun parts. it can be done, its just a lot of time consuming effort. The gas cyliniders on M1 garands cannot be parkerized, so I do powder coat a lot of them.

I also do media blasting on poretty much anything. most shops charge a fortune to do small parts, I dont. I do this sort of thing as a hobby out of my garage, so im not trying to earn a living or keep a business running, so I am able to do this kind of work real cheap. I dont have set prices, i just go by the list of parts you want done and whatr you want done to them. I also do work in trade for gun parts and anything else interesting. email me with a list of what you need done and we'll work something out.

Wife also shot about 500 rnds of 22(She likes to plink). After everything was said and done we decided to start collecting our brass as I am contemplating reloading and would like to have my brass back to see if it makes cents(ALL PUN INTENDED). 



After grabbing what was left on the concrete pad(maybe 250-300 rnds) we went off the pad over to our brass pile and starting shoveling our brass into a box only to have the owner(Some old geiser) come out and be a total dick to my buddy and I saying, ""That brass is now part of the range and you can't take any of it."" I replied back to him saying,"" I am sorry sir but I just shot over 2000 rnds and the people behind me can confirm that this brass pile is mine and I would like to take it home."" He went ballistic and yelled at me for taking the brass off the range right in front of at least 20 people. 



I was cordial enough to pour the box of brass out (500+ rounds) and didnt say a word. However, I walked back up to the shack where you pay and read the rules. Right in the rules it states that brass not on the concrete is part of the range. The old F*%($ tried to inform me about his brass collecting business and the running of his range to keep his head above the water and he was greeted with a formal, ""With all do respect sir but, F U!"" I left of coarse never to return to an establishment that about everytime I go there I am always getting yelled at for 2 second rules or something retarded. That will be the last time I pay that man for anything! I hope your business goes under and you are forced to live in that camper for the rest of your life you low life disrespectful asshole! I simply wanted to snag my brass(Maybe 6$ worth) and take it home for a project. I payed you 40$ for everyone to shoot on your range and you belittle me in public...... Nuf Said.

Barrel date of 12-17. Has been through an aresenal rebuild at sometime. A.A. cartouche, along with a P in a box and an S in a box. Wood is nice with typical handling marks. Metal is very good. Original parkerized finish has been re-parked over with one portion having been taped over to preserve inspection marks. Mostly Eddystone parts, but others mixed in as well. Front sight band is cracked on the underside, but solid and sound. Most likely used as a ceremonial rifle by VFW or other organizations and probably fired black powder blanks. Consequently, there is some significant pitting  in the bore around the muzzle. Otherwise, the bore is in good shootable condition, plenty of rifling, some light frosting in the grooves. Despite the bore condition, it is a good shooter, and keeps Greek HXP surplus round in the black on standard 100 and 200 yard targets. As mentioned, there are additional pictures available upon request. Happy to answer any other questions as best as I can. Contact via email or at REDACTED."

This barrel was pulled from a US-issue (not foreign loan) Service Grade M1 rifle bought directly from the CMP about 10 years ago. It is dated May 1944.

I have no way of measuring the muzzle wear or throat erosion. It was rated as Service Grade by the CMP and has seen less than 100 rounds since then. One of the photos shows a round of M2 ball inserted into the muzzle. Finish is dark black and excellent (with some exceptions). No pitting I can see. Gas port is not chromed. Muzzle crown is somewhat worn (see photos). Breech face is not ""in the white"" but not clearly parkerized either. The barrel may have been re-parkerized. If it was, though, it was not done together with the receiver, as they had clearly different colors (see some of the photos at the link below). The breech face has a significant ding/gouge (see photos) which doesn't affect operation. There are small nicks/gouges right above the barrel date stamp (see photos) from my vice, as I was a fool and initially tried to unscrew the barrel with inadequate protection around it (wood blocks which were too thin). See photos for all the markings (drawing number, proofs, etc.).

for 12guage i use a 900$ horandy progressive press that can spit out rounds at a very fast rate.  i have all sorts of different hulls, powders, shot, and primers to adjust the rounds depending if these are for hunting or just basic clay trap shooting, which is what i have the press setup for. the 12guage rounds can be reloaded in a very fast turnaround time, usually a few hours i can have hundreds of rounds spit out and ready to use.  i can load home defense rounds also, would need to get some 00 buckshot but thats it.  i have around 2000 empty winchester aa hulls which i can use at a extra charge or i can use your own spent shells as long as they are reloadable( sts, aa, etc hulls).  price depends on all sorts of factors, but basic cray trap shells will cost about 1/2 what they would be new, and will shoot exactly they same!"
