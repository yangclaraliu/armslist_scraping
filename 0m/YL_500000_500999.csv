This .38 Special version of the Smith 640 was made for only a few years.
S&W then went to making the .357 Mag version of this model. This .38spl 
version is sought after due to it's shorter barrel and lighter weight when
compared to the longer and heavier .357/640 model.

I bought this gun for an elk hunt but did not get drawn so my loss is your gain. The reason I bought this gun is because if you sight this gun in 3 inches high at 100 yards you will stay within the vitals all the way out to 400 yards without any holdover. It is an amazing caliber but I just don't have use for it right now. Ammo is expensive ($120+ for a box of ammo and $70 for just the brass) but you will never need to buy ammo or brass again if you reload with this package. I have over 120 new brass (I will confirm exact number), probably 20 once fired brass, 20 reloaded rounds (maybe more as I am going to use the rest of my h-1000 powder to reload some more ammo to go with the package...I will update as I do), and a set of RCBS dies. Anybody going out West to hunt, needs this gun! Gun is in fantastic shape! Look on Weatherby.com and you will see the deal you are getting! 

Gun Includes the following: 

Weatherby Mark V Accumark with Accubrake in great shape (Asking price on website is $2300) 
Nikon Monarch UCC 4-16x40 with Adjustable Objective Scope (1"") (If you don't want the scope, deduct 300) 
Leupold Dual Dovetail Mounts and Rings professionally installed with Loc-Tite (1 inch rings) 
Weatherby 30 MM rings and mounts for if you have a 30 mm scope. 
120 new factory brass in Weatherby boxes 
20+ once fired factory brass (I am tracking down more once fired brass) 
20 reloaded rounds plus any additional rounds I reload in the mean time and data for reloaded rounds. 
A Set of RCBS Dies 
Limbsaver Barrel Dampener- greatly reduces vibrations and tightens up groups even more (Can be easily removed from the barrel...just slides off)

Price for everything is $1900

I love this gun. In my opinion it's the most accurate carbine made. The 995TS is the Cadillac of inexpensive rifles and carbines: cheap, durable, reliable. Only shot two-hundred rounds through it but never had a FTF or FTE. Handles +P ammo without a hiccup.

Original version of the M4 style red dot with 3x magnifier.  This red dot is very lightly used(maybe 200 rounds on my SIG 522 rifle).  It is not a factory 2nd or blemished model.  Works perfect, I am only selling it because I have decided to go with an Aimpoint PRO.  Must be purchased as a set as I don't have any use for the magnifier.  Nothing wrong with the magnifier either, I have just decided I prefer to shoot without them.  Includes all of the original packaging, caps, spacers, mounts, etc..

I had an AWA 3"" that you had to remove the ejector housing to get the cylinder out, STUPID DESIGN, and my Colt Sheriff didn't even have an ejector so reloading it was a joke.. This is the last of my 5 Ubertis. As with the others, THE TIMING IS PERFECT. EVERY OTHER BRAND REVOLVER I'VE EVER USED HAD A LINE ON THE CYLINDER! This single action revolver has been used and very well cared for. It could pass for new. The box is included. I've used factory loads, but have a recipe for 900FPS Cowboy loads that are easy on the hand and some of my cases have been loaded 6 times without signs of wear or splitting.
There are cheaper models available with flat BLACK PAINT and plastic grips. Uberti has made guns for Cimarron, Beretta and probably a few others but I always bought under their name. I CAN'T DO PICTURES. NO SHIPPING, TRADING, OR OFFERS. OHIO RESIDENTS ONLY. $425 CASH.

636,http://www.armslist.com/posts/500636,"For Sale:  WTS Kindle Keyboard 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6"" E Ink Display","Thornton, Denver, Colorado",$ 50,"Listed On: Saturday, August 18, 2012",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"List price $189, selling for $50. Comes w/ power cord. Excellent E-Reader!!!!

If you're purchasing a device primarily for reading, an important consideration is the screen technology. Unlike devices with LCD screens, Kindle e-readers use the latest generation of Electronic Ink (""E Ink"") technology – E Ink Pearl – designed specifically to deliver clearer, sharper text that makes reading for extended periods of time more comfortable. Here are some of the advantages to reading on an E Ink device:

Reads Like Real Paper, Even in Bright Sunlight
E Ink screens look and read just like real paper. Kindle e-readers' matte screens reflect light like ordinary paper and use no backlighting, so you can read as easily in bright sunlight as in your living room. Unlike LCD screens, E Ink screens have no glare.

Easy on the Eyes
E Ink uses actual ink particles to create crisp, print-like text similar to what you see in a physical book. And Kindle e-readers also use proprietary, hand-built fonts to take advantage of the special characteristics of the ink to make letters appear clear and sharp.


• Less eye fatigue: Every time your eye switches from a bright screen to a dimmer, ambient room, your eyes have to adjust, which may result in fatigue. With E Ink, the page is the same brightness as everything else in the room so there's no adjustment needed.

• Reduced glare: All E Ink surfaces are treated to be matte like a printed page, reducing glare and increasing legibility.

• Read in any position: E Ink screens have a uniform contrast ratio that does not change with your viewing angle, so you can read in any position.

• Sharp, clear text: E Ink screens have 100% aperture ratio, so there are no gaps between pixels. The blacks and whites on an E Ink screen are uniform, improving image quality.


Read with One Hand
Ranging from 5.98 ounces to 8.7 ounces, Kindle e-readers are lighter than most paperback books, and weigh half as much as many LCD tablet devices, making it easy and comfortable to hold in one hand for extended periods of time.

Longer Battery Life
Electronic ink screens also have the advantage of significantly lower power consumption than LCD screens. E Ink screens do not require power to maintain a page of text, allowing you to read for up to a month or two on a single charge versus hours on a tablet or smart phone.





Is Kindle (Wi-Fi) or Kindle 3G (Free 3G + Wi-Fi) right for me?

Kindle (Wi-Fi) is a great choice if you already have a high-speed internet connection and wireless router set up in your home and do not need the added convenience of a 3G connection. 3G enables you to download books anytime, anywhere, while on the go. If you do not have Wi-Fi set up in your home, Kindle 3G may be a better option.

Kindle 3G (Free 3G + Wi-Fi) is the easiest option because there is no wireless setup—you are ready to shop, purchase, and read right out of the box. Built-in Free 3G connectivity uses the same wireless signals that cell phones use, but there are no monthly fees or commitments—Amazon pays for Kindle’s 3G wireless connectivity. The added convenience of 3G enables you to download books anytime, anywhere, while on the go—without having to find a Wi-Fi hotspot connection. With wireless coverage in over 100 countries and territories, Kindle 3G is a great option for travelers."

This rifle was created by Waffen Werks by beginning with a Romanian PSL and completely changing it to an AK47 type rifle. I spoke with Waffen Werks and had a model hand selected for my personal collection. There were only a handful of these made available to the public, and will be guaranteed to turn heads when you bring it to the range. Since I bought my example, the PSL supply has dried up completely and nobody believes that they will be available again. I have personally only fired about five magazines of ammo through this until all my loose rounds were used up. It never hicupped once, and was a blast to shoot. This rifle really tamed down the big 7.62X54 Russian caliber. Since buying it, I have added more magazines and a scope and receiver mount. 

Here is information from the distributor:

The AK-54R rifles are built upon Category 1 (nice, minty, un issued) Romanian PSL rifle parts kits, using a special receiver that allows for the use of regular AKM type butt stocks and pistol grips. They also feature a correct, and fully functional, scope mount, installed on the left side of the receiver . The barrel is shortened to 16.5 inches, and is re-profiled, allowing the gas block and handguard retainer to be moved rearward, so that standard AKM length gas pistons (we use a Tapco stainless unit, which provides an extra 922r compliance part) and standard AKM type handguards can be used! The idea is simply to give the end user an AKM sized package that delivers the powerful punch of the 7.62x54R cartridge. This initial batch of rifles will feature a non-pinned Romanian PSL muzzle device, on 14x1 LH threads, K-VAR synthetic furniture, in plum, beautiful gun kote finish . 

The last example I have seen available was a used rifle only on gunbroker didn't meet reserve at $1,050.00. I am offering my fine rifle at a comparable $1,050.00 since that's what the last bidder determined the value to be at. For that price you will receive the rifle, one magazine, the original bayonet, and original manual. THIS HAS BEEN SOLD.

I can include the following for extra:
Osprey 4x32 scope, receiver mount, flip up scope caps @ $100.00 SOLD
Additional 10 round PSL Dragonov magazines @ $55.00 each  THREE LEFT!
One unopened can of 440 rounds 7.62x54R ammo @ $100.00 SOLD

These were assembled by DSA using one of their own semi-auto receivers and, I believe, excellent condition Polish parts sets. The rifles are factory new. The furniture may have dings from their previous life. Some of the metal might too. Everything has been refinished and is beautiful. You can confirm that in the photos. The RPD was one in a series of weapons by a Russian arms designer named Degtyarov. Many of you will recognize that name. What he means most to me is the robust and simple locking system that he developed in the DP and continued on through the RPD to the PKM and even the big DSHK. In the RPD, due to its smaller caliber, the action is remarkable robust. The machinegun was put into widescale service in 1953. It was the standard machine gun of the Vietcong during our war with them. . These guns fire from the closed bolt using a striker. The semi-auto disconnect limits them to one round per trigger pull. Let me go over some features as I examine this trophy lying across my lap. The feed cover latches positively and locks open reliably. Lifting it reveals a simple feed mechanism operated by the lug on the top rear of the bolt assembly. The rear sight is windage adjustable and has steps in 100 meter increments to 1000 meters. It has a square notch. I wonder how ballistically effective the AK round is out that far. Remember, it's ballistically about like a 30/30. The front handguard is wood. Pretty too. Moving forward is the block with the sling attachment point. Then comes the adjustable gas block. The front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation to allow you to zero the rear sight. A bipod is mounted just to the rear of the front sight assembly. The bipod folds under the barrel. There is a cleaning rod to the lower left of the receiver. The feed mechanism has dust covers on both sides. There is a mechanism for hanging the belt drum which is a container for the non-disintegrating belt. The trigger pull is heavy. The safety is accessible to the right trigger finger. The wood buttstock is pristine. The buttplate has an access door to the recoil assembly and the cleaning kit storage. This rifle comes with two drums with belts and two canvas pouches to contain them. There is a canvas carry case for the rifle. There is a rifle sling, a cleaning and tool kit, an attachment that threads onto the muzzle to guide the cleaning rod and spare the muzzle. The rifle will arrive in an hard case. The manual is extensive. Ships to FFL only."

726,http://www.armslist.com/posts/500726,For Sale:  DSA RPD RPDS,"NY, Buffalo, New York","$ 1,300","Listed On: Saturday, August 4, 2012",Rifles,DS Arms                                                                                ,no type,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I'm referring to the DSArms brand new in the box RPDS belt fed in 7.62X39. These were assembled by DSA using one of their own semi-auto receivers and, I believe, excellent condition Polish parts sets. The rifles are factory new. The furniture may have dings from their previous life. Some of the metal might too. Everything has been refinished and is beautiful. You can confirm that in the photos. The RPD was one in a series of weapons by a Russian arms designer named Degtyarov. Many of you will recognize that name. What he means most to me is the robust and simple locking system that he developed in the DP and continued on through the RPD to the PKM and even the big DSHK. In the RPD, due to its smaller caliber, the action is remarkable robust. The machinegun was put into widescale service in 1953. It was the standard machine gun of the Vietcong during our war with them. . These guns fire from the closed bolt using a striker. The semi-auto disconnect limits them to one round per trigger pull. Let me go over some features as I examine this trophy lying across my lap. The feed cover latches positively and locks open reliably. Lifting it reveals a simple feed mechanism operated by the lug on the top rear of the bolt assembly. The rear sight is windage adjustable and has steps in 100 meter increments to 1000 meters. It has a square notch. I wonder how ballistically effective the AK round is out that far. Remember, it's ballistically about like a 30/30. The front handguard is wood. Pretty too. Moving forward is the block with the sling attachment point. Then comes the adjustable gas block. The front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation to allow you to zero the rear sight. A bipod is mounted just to the rear of the front sight assembly. The bipod folds under the barrel. There is a cleaning rod to the lower left of the receiver. The feed mechanism has dust covers on both sides. There is a mechanism for hanging the belt drum which is a container for the non-disintegrating belt. The trigger pull is heavy. The safety is accessible to the right trigger finger. The wood buttstock is pristine. The buttplate has an access door to the recoil assembly and the cleaning kit storage. This rifle comes with two drums with belts and two canvas pouches to contain them. There is a canvas carry case for the rifle. There is a rifle sling, a cleaning and tool kit, an attachment that threads onto the muzzle to guide the cleaning rod and spare the muzzle. The rifle will arrive in an hard case. The manual is extensive. Ships to FFL only."

The weapon has seen use at the range and is in great condition, kept cleaned and well lubed.  Shoots straight and without any issues, took her out just last week and she is accurate, zeroed to 100 yards.  I will include 3 loaded 30 round magazines with the deal.

Serious inquiries only please.  Asking price is $600 but I will entertain other offers.  I know a thing or two about this weapon platform, its ins/outs/ and prices on the market so I will NOT even entertain offers less than $500.  I'm trying to sell it on here, not because I am desperate and need the cash but because I am looking into a 5.56 platform.  And I don't feel like giving it away to some gun shop owner who will just resell it.
