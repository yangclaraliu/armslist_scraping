All my bows are made with 100% natural materials and are fully functional. I am looking to trade one of my custom bows for a pistol. Looking for a semi-automatic pistol, 380 or larger for my wife. 
This bow style is from Northern California. It's 35# @ 15"" draw, made of Osage Orange and backed with real sinew applied with hand-made hide glue. Handle is whitetail rawhide sewn on with real gut. And the string is hand twisted and made with real sinew. Just like they used to make them thousands of years ago. This short style of bow was used daily and suited the thick, dense, forests they lived in. Bow is highly reflexed. Back of the bow is hand-painted.
Museum quality, one-of-a-kind! Took over a month to build, conservative value is $600+, never see one of these again.

I bought this rifle new from Bob Holloway in Ft. Worth, TX. Seems like it was in the early 80's. This one is #305 and Bob told me that less than 300 were actually built. They started out by machining the receivers from solid stock then to keep cost down, tried to investment cast them. The IC ones cracked. The entire project was abandoned. I'm not sure of all the reasons they went out of the rifle business, but lack of quality wasn't one of them. The rifle I have has about one box put through it. I have the box as well which has some water staining on one end. It has been some time ago that I bought this. It is a very, very rare rifle! I did considerable research on this and could find very little information about it. If you want to own one of the rarest assault type rifles in existence, this is your chance.

This rifle began its life as a Rock River Arms A2 LAR-15.    The upper was sent to White Oak Armaments, one of the top gunsmiths for service rifle competitors in the US.    They completely tore it down and reworked it starting around a Pac Nor match grade stainless steel post-ban barrel with 11 degree target crown.    The barrel is 1 in 7 twist with a Wylde Chamber.  It is free floating under the handguard.    They matched the bolt face to the chamber  and installed a .62 front sight blade.   The rear sight was installed and features ¼ MOA adjustments per click.  I currently have a .46 rear sight hooded aperature, but have several other sizes for it.   The lower was worked over with a two stage jewell trigger that is adjustable for pull and overtravel and breaks like glass.  I have installed lead in the buttstock to perfectly balance the rifle.  This is a heavy rifle, but that makes it rock solid in position.  On my current competition load of a BR2 bench rest primer, 25.4 grains of Varget and a Sierra Match King 75.gr bullet, this rifle will shoot 3/8” groups consistently at 100 yards from bench rest.    

It shoots better than I do, that’s for sure.   The best I’ve managed to post with it is Expert, but I don’t get enough time in at the range to make Master or High Master.  Such is life. :P

This rifle is built to spec for NRA and Civilian Marksmanship Program Matches and comes with a Turner All-Weather 1907 competition sling and hard case.  No ammo, no magazines included.  This rifle has had roughly 500 rounds put through it since it was worked over."

DESCRIPTION FROM LWRC WEBSITE:
LWRC M6A2 SPR Semi Automatic Rifle, 5.56 NATO 14.7"" Hammer Forged Spiral Fluted Barrel with Pinned Flash Hider, Magpul ACS Stock, Magpul MIAD Grip, SPR-MOD Railed Handguard, 30 Round Mag, Gas Piston, Skirmish Sights

""The SPR features our enhanced fire control group, a Magpul MIAD pistol grip, and the new Magpul ACS stock. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The M6A2 rifle can be used in various roles from close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas, an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters."""

This rifle was born when our Fed gov’t decided in Regulation ATF 922R that any new firearm could not have more than 10 imported parts in it.   At the time the Heckler and Koch model 91 chambered in 7.62 NATO was one of the most popular rifles around and for good reason…

They run like tanks and are very accurate!

This is the civilian version of the German G3 design that has been used by their military since the 1950’s.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_G3

After the ban on imports,  JLD industries bought the engineering and machining from HK to manufacture the model 91 here in the states.   These rifles have had several evolutions since the original offering and are rock solid performers.  here is the current model listing:

http://www.ptr91.com/rifles

Here are the specs for this particular variation:

18” Button-rifled heavy target barrel in 1 in 12 right hand twist
Semi-auto recoil operated
20 rd box magazine fed
Rotary diopter rear sight with bullet drop compensation set for 100,200,300 and 400 yards
The rifle comes with 15 Magazines, a Brugger and Thomet Picatinny rail mount for optics mount (150 bucks on its own), hard case, sight tool and manual

Bolt and trigger group are manufactured by HK, all other parts are JLD

The trigger is pretty darned good for a rifle of this type

Rifle has about 1000 rounds put down the pipe in its lifetime

To feed this rifle I have for sale 4x200 rds of NATO 7.62 ammo manufactured by Fabrique National of Belgium.   Headstamp is 1977 manufacture.  The only Military Surplus ammo more accurate and reliable than this is the Lithuanian variety and you can’t find either of them anywhere.   If anyone offers them for sale, they are snapped up in seconds.   These are berdan primed cases, so they require a berdan decapping die to reload them."

Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Pistol Model in 9mm. It's been stored and is in excellent condition. The gun pictured may have a different serial number, but is a NIB Uzi. 
The UZI pistol was developed by Israel Military Industries (now IWI Ltd) during early 1980s from the famous Micro-UZI submachine gun. Intended users for the UZI pistol were various security agencies and services which wanted a high-capacity semi-automatic pistol, and civilian shooters (mostly in USA) which also wanted such gun with ""cool Uzi style"". Despite somewhat rough appearance UZI pistols were reliable and quite accurate. It also must be noted that 'original' UZI pistols should not be confused with full-size weapons based on semi-automatic only full-size Uzi carbines but without the shoulder stock. 
UZI pistol is blowback-operated semi-automatic weapon which fires from closed bolt. It has a stamped steel receiver and the bolt is fully enclosed inside. Bolt is of 'telescoped' design, that is, it is hollow in the front and encloses the rear part of the barrel when in battery. Uzi pistol has a single action trigger and utilizes an internal sliding striker (firing pin). Manual safety of sliding type, and is located above the grip on the left side of the gun. Magazines are of double stack design, interchangeable with other guns of Uzi family (in 9mm caliber). Sights are of open type, with flip-up rear sight, adjustable for windage.

It is a 45 cal. These were made in Japan and marketed in the United States. My father purchased this as a kit before I was ever born and took it apparently took it hunting. I cannot give an exact round count, but I would imagine low because my father was never an avid hunter. I have never shot it and to my understanding the last time it was fired was back 1986 with just a powder load to scare some community kids (per my mom) It has a octagon barrel which from what I have looked up is the better of barrels that came with this gun, some were two part barrels that consisted of two parts one octagon and one circular. It has its original metal ramrod and very nice brass patch box, trigger guard, and nose cap and thimbles. It has an overall length around 50"". All the original screws and furniture are present minus 1 screw on the trigger guard, one screw on the end plate, and one screw on the bottom rear plate, one nut is missing on the patch box as pictured, but I do have the screw stowed in the patch box so it just needs a new nut. It is also missing the rear sight. It is not in perfect condition, but was refinished a few years back by my dad and has pretty much been stored away for the past 10 years at my house. I will try and get as many pictures as I can on here, but if you need more feel free to let me know.

Pawn shops offer very little. Only would be interested in brand new ar 15 made by colt. Kimber pistols and colt 1911. If the colt 1911 is very old I would offer less because they aren't worth as much as you think.

It is a Single Action 45ACP, Single Stack pistol but holds 8+1 instead of 7+1.


I have swapped out the bushing for a thicker walled bushing, it is tighter than a stock bushing but isn't so tight that it makes the pistol picky on ammo. Also Swapped the Hammer and Sear for Colt parts for a smoother trigger and it does help. It has about a 2 mm trigger pull and a sharp stop with a very short reset. Not bad for a slightly modified control system. This pistol also has the Half Cock safety so you may carry with the pistol Fully Loaded and Half Cocked, or Fully Loaded, Locked and on Safe.

The headstamp on the cartridges is L C. The pic shows the only information available on the can -- you can see it says ""linked"" but that has been spray painted over, and obviously it's not linked, and it does not appear to be de-linked (ie not dented) ammo. The ammo all appears to be clean and shiny in good shape. Good brass, non-corrosive, reloadable.
I didn't dump it out or count it, but with the foam that is inside the top of the can to keep the ammo tight I'm sure it's the full 250 count. See the price or make an offer. Cash only, not interested in any trades."

This bow is ready to shoot and comes with a Trophy Ridge whisker biscuit, Trophy Ridge Hawk sight, self aligning peep sight, kisser button, Trophy Ridge quiver, nock loop, stabilizer, and wrist strap.

I purchased the bow brand new in 2010 and only shot about 100 arrows through it. It is in perfect shape. Retail price for the bow was $469, broadheads were $40, and the release was about $40. I'll let it go for $250 obo.

If you offer me a 9mm or a .45 I would like to swap some ammo if you have any to part with. I will not sell any of my gear outwright, money is no good wright now. I can't just sell the thing and go buy a new one so an even trade is the only thing that makes sense. Ammo for ammo, glock for glock; or glock for a 9mm/45acp. If you offer me a 1911 we can talk turkey depending on what you have. I would still want aleast 3 mags and a little ammo out of the deal. Thanks, get back to me if your interested in a fair trade."

The headstamp on the cartridges is L C. The pic shows the only information available on the can -- you can see it says ""linked"" but that has been spray painted over, and obviously it's not linked, and it does not appear to be de-linked (ie not dented) ammo. The ammo all appears to be clean and shiny in good shape. Good brass, non-corrosive, reloadable.
I didn't dump it out or count it, but with the foam that is inside the top of the can to keep the ammo tight I'm sure it's the full 250 count. See the price or make an offer. Cash only, not interested in any trades"

I also realize prices will probably never get down to $80-$100 for a stripped lower again which is why Im offering $150 or the 210 rds of Tracers.

The headstamp on the cartridges is L C. The pic shows the only information available on the can -- you can see it says ""linked"" but that has been spray painted over, and obviously it's not linked, and it does not appear to be de-linked (ie not dented) ammo. The ammo all appears to be clean and shiny in good shape. Good brass, non-corrosive, reloadable.
I didn't dump it out or count it, but with the foam that is inside the top of the can to keep the ammo tight I'm sure it's the full 250 count. See the price or make an offer. Cash only, not interested in any trades"
