Competitive shooting matches can heat up when the targets are tough, and you need all the gun you can get. The new Super X3 Sporting, with its lightweight, aluminum alloy receiver is as beautiful as it is strong.

The Invector-Plus™ Choke System, partnered with precise .742"" Back-Boring regulate the shot more efficiently than any other system. An adjustable comb stock and a Pachmayr® Decelerator® recoil pad help absorb felt recoil so you can shoot all day long. Its superb balance, quick shouldering, pointability and effortless swing become natural in your hands. No other sporting gun wraps such beauty and performance in one deluxe package.

9mm matte finish, Maple grove area, but willing to meet in other cities 

Comes with 5 mags (2 with snap grip extensions), speed loader, case, and two interchangeable back straps (small and medium) the large is currently on and I can get a comfortable full grip on the gun with my big hands, hence why I bout it. (bullets not included) 

Little bit of wear on one side of safety (cosmetic) and the sights where adjusted and left small nick (shoots straight as an arrow) and could be covered up with some nail polish or a dab of paint. Overall a great gun and hope someone else will enjoy it as much as me."

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and
interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
3. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
4. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
5. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
6. Magazine: High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds (1 round for .45 Auto caliber).
7. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.
8. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design. 
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
13. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction)."

I also put a new breach plug in it last year after the season ended. I’ve owned it for 4 years and I have switched all my hunting over to archery which is the reason I’m selling this one.

An decently priced AK style/variants rifle is what I'm looking for.  I can appreciate that very nicely made rifle that costs into the thousands, but I'm just not buying that.  Just looking for something simple and, well, basic...you can read that as cheap if you want.  

I would also be interested in an AR-15 style, but they tend to be very highly priced.  If you have an AR you are thinking of selling, I can probably only afford a basic, DPMS or PSA, one.  

I'm really not that picky though.  If you have something you are thinking of selling, please just email me with what you have (and accessories you are selling with it). Please be ready to send me pics as well, and include your price, as there is no point in wasting time if I can't afford it.

5.) I HAVE HAD SELLERS AGREE WITH ME ON A SELLING PRICE OF A SHOTGUN, AGREE TO TELL OTHERS IT WAS SOLD TO ME, AGREE ON TIME FOR ME TO TRAVEL AND PICK IT UP, ONLY TO GET AN EMAIL THAT THEY SOLD IT FOR $30. MORE, AFTER THEY HAD ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS SOLD TO ME.
I WOULD HAVE LIKED FOR HIM TO AT LEAST ASK ME IF I WOULD PAY HIM $30. MORE, WHICH I WOULD HAVE DONE, BUT NOOOO! LACK OF GOOD CHARACTOR!

6.) LYING AND GREED SEEMS TO BE A TYPICAL CHARACTOR FLAW WITH SOME OF THEM. 

""WHAT HAPPENED TO BEING A MAN OF YOUR WORD""?

I THINK THAT I WILL REQUIRE PAYPAL PAYMENTS OR MO PAYMENTS BEFORE I SET APPOINTMENTS TO DELIVER THE ITEM.  ALSO, I WILL TELL THIS TYPE OF PERSON TO LOOK UP THE ITEM ON THE INTERNET TO GET THE ANSWERS TO THEIR QUESTIONS.

TIMEWASTERS, TIREKICKERS, AND LOWBALLERS I WON'T BOTHER WITH AT ALL.

I NOT TALKING ABOUT EXPENSIVE ITEMS, NO, ITEMS UNDER $50.  YOU WOULD THINK THEY WERE HAVING TO MAKE A ONE-MILLION DOLLAR BUYING DECISION. 

EITHER THEY ARE LACKING GOOD CHARACTOR, GOOD MANNERS, OR JUST STUPID JERKS.

THERE, I DO FEEL BETTER.  I HOPE THAT SOME OF YOU OTHER SELLERS DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH THESE SAME ONES."

Here are the details:

This M1 Garand was manufactured in July 1955.  Based on info contained in ""The M1 Garand Serial Numbers and Data Sheets"" by Scott A. Duff, this rifle is correct except for the stock set.  CMP installed a new wood set (not available to be included in this sale) but I have since replaced it with a Boyd's stock set as you'll see in the buttstock photo.  The photo showing the op rod drawing number shows the earlier version stock set - it was NOT pretty!  I have removed the cosmoline shown in the photos.  I do not have ME or TE gauges.  I have put maybe 64 rds through it.  Awesome shooter!  Finish is beautiful - 95% or better.

Gun Details Now available from EAA is the Sarsilmaz K2—an all-steel DA/SA combat pistol built for the Turkish military. This particular pistol was chambered in .45 ACP. This is not some new company, and this is not really a new pistol. Sarsilmaz has been building light arms for 131 years and is the sole supplier of pistols to the Turkish Armed Forces. They are also one of the largest arms producers in Europe. The K2 was rather broadly based upon the CZ-75 pistols, one of the most prolific pistols around, having been proven in service for years. Sarsilmaz builds these pistols at a state-of-the-art facility in Turkey using the latest in CAD/CAM and CNC technology. They are well built and easily some of the toughest pistols out there.

additional Notes: The S&W 10XX series pistols are undoubtedly some of the best-built 10mm firearms ever made. They are very robust and are quite reliable.

610 - While most 10mm Auto firearms were designed for the law enforcement/self defense market, there is one Smith & Wesson that has been marketed more towards the hunting/competitive shooting crowd. Like the 10xx series pistols it is of stainless steel construction. Unlike the 10xx series though, it is not a semiauto pistol, but an N-frame revolver. Because of the 10mm's rimless design the 610 uses moon clips (full, half, or two-round clips are available). This therefore allows the use of .40 S&W ammunition which is relatively inexpensive compared to factory 10mm ammo. (It is important to thoroughly clean the chambers after firing the shorter rounds to ensure the longer 10mm case will seat fully.) The Smith & Wesson 610 revolver has been offered in a variety of barrel lengths including 3"" (Lew Horton limited edition), 4"" (the most recent version), 5"", 6"" and 6.5"" The 610 came standard with a non-fluted cylinder, but the 5"" and the early 6.5"" versions were equipped with fluted cylinders. The Lew Horton 3"" version and the 5"" fluted 610 are highly prized by collectors which is reflected in their scarcity and price."

I'm starting this off as a package deal, individual parts are not for sale just yet.

None of these items have been used at an event (I know, It's pathetic) and none of these items have seen more use than a single can of green gas.

Total asking price will be $1,000. 

This is an extremely high end airsoft gas blowback rifle, it's a ton of fun, has the realism of an AR-15, but you can shoot your friends with it.

Here's a video review - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JuV1rtfD7s

Here's what you get for your One Thousand Big Ones

2011 Inokatsu M4 MTW SOPMOD Super version GBBR. This includes the knights armaments replica rail system, the real M4A2 flash hider, real pistol grips, steel superbolt, collapsible stock, licensed COLT engravings, etc. etc. I can not describe how beautiful this GBBR is. **** This thing has not even been shot enough to go through a single can of green gas *****

ONE ProWin v2 GBBR Magazine with feed lips specifically for Inokatsu

G&P Knights Armament M203 Short - You can see it on the Ino in the pictures below, it's nothing short of perfect.

G&P Acog Replica 4x magnification - Perfect condition, looks great, feels great, performs great, etc.

G&P PEQII - Completely functional, amazing quality, laser (and light) are very bright and laser lines up dead center with the ACOG crosshair.

China made mbus flip up rear sight

TWO ICS 40mm airsoft grenades (shotgun style) Only been used maybe 3 times.

TWO cans of KWA Green gas (one is close to empty, but not quite yet).

*Not Pictured* Tactical soft case to carry it all in


So that's it, total retail price for all of that? I think it was close to $1,700 back in March of this year. So it's basically $700 off retail, plus no shipping, for a GBBR system that in it's entirety has seen less than 200 shots fired! I'm pretty sure that's a steal."
