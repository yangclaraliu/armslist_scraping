This is the most pleasurable to shoot -and insanely accurate pistol I have ever owned.  However it's so nice that I don't even want to take it out to the range - and I sure as hell don't want to holster it or carry it.  So instead of keeping it sitting in the safe... I'm going to let someone else enjoy it.

Gun is an old - mint Sig Sauer P220 in .45.  This is the real deal - when the slides were still marked WEST Germany :)

These old Sigs are of a quality that the new ones just don't quite have.  

The finish / bore / everything is mint.  The Hogue Rosewood grips were $100 alone and they are perfect and beautiful.

This gun does have the European style mag release on the magwell - not the standard push button on the side of the grip.

The gun comes with:

[b]Original box / owners manual / factory test target

2 factory magaznies

Factory grips (one has a small crack ... they were stored in a box of stuff and I think something heavy got on them.

Sig Sauer branded kydex style holster

Sig Sauer branded kydex style dual mag carrier.[/b]

I just watched one of these go for $690 on gunbroker without the grips / holster / etc.

I WILL TAKE $700 FOR EVERYTHING - OBO - OR BEST TRADE TODAY.  

I'm about to run out of things I want to trade for.... but the list of things I might be interested goes like this:

A very, VERY nice 1911 - mint loaded springfield or a mint smith and wesson 1911 might do it.

Comes with everything it did from the factory(Gun, FN magazine,box, manual, cleaning kit, lock...).  It is a very accurate and compact 5.56 weapon.   It cycles the empty shells down a tube and they drop out the front so no searching for your spent casings.

Appleseed rifle marksmanship clinics are family-friendly, and open to all, from novice shooters to experts.  There is a $5.00 per day charge for women, and a $2.50 per day charge for youth (under 21). Peace officers, active duty military, National Guard, reserve, disabled and elected officials shoot FREE as honored guests. For all others, the cost is only $70.00 for both days, or $45.00 for one day of instruction by some of the best rifle marksmanship instructors in the nation.  Attend one day or both days.

Unless a specific host range specifies otherwise, you may shoot anything from a .22 rimfire (the Ruger 10/22 and Marlin 795 are popular) to a centerfire such as an AR, AK, SKS, M1A or M1.  You will shoot approximately 250 rounds per day as you try to qualify as a Rifleman (210 Points) on a modified version of the AQT (Army Qualification Test) course of fire. 

The number of slots for each shoot is limited, so pre-registration is highly encouraged to make sure a spot on the line is reserved for you.  Politics are not discussed at Appleseed shoots, except for the politics of 1775.  NOTE: Participation in an Appleseed shoot meets the marksmanship requirement of the Civilian Marksmanship Program to purchase a vintage M1 Garand rifle at a DEEP discount.  The Revolutionary War Veterans Association (RWVA) is a CMP affiliated organization.

I would be happy to answer any questions you have about the specifics of an Appleseed event.  As of right now, we have the following shoots scheduled for Kentucky.  More shoots may be added throughout the year.

Great gun, accurate and reliable. I bought this when I was a youngin' because ammunition was cheap and that made it a fun gun for the range.

I had originally purchased a case of ammunition with the gun - I had shot most of it (which would be about how many rounds have been through the gun total). Somehow, the last few hundred round, case - and my other stuff that was in the case - vanished. When I went to price getting more ammo for the thing I was a bit shocked at how much it has gone up.

For me, that was what the gun was for. Cheap fun at the range. It may still be fun but it's sure not as cheap to shoot now - so off she goes!

It comes with everything seen in the picture including FNAR, FNH plastic case, Extra cheek welds, extra butt pads, 3 mags(2 NIB),lock, manual and I will throw in a box of Federal Gold Medal Match ammo.

It is guaranteed from the factory to shoot 1” groups or less. I have 8 boxes of 20 rounds extra for sale. They are this guns favorite ammo, Federal Premium 168 gr sierra Matchking BTHP gold medal match. They run around $30 a box, I will sell them for $20 a box.

With its small internal hammer  and only weighing in at 15 ounces makes this a breeze to carry concealed. This exact gun got ""best in class revolver"" in the 2010 December Gun Tests consumer magazine. I've only been able to shoot half a box of ammo through it and only carried it half a dozen times. This gun is super nice without any flaws. Comes with original case, receipts and all. I'm only selling it due to other hobby's and bills. Even though I paid 550.00 dollars for this gun last Christmas I'm open to reasonable offers. It's been a safe queen ever since I bought it. Please call: REDACTED anytime for more info!

The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

FS: Wilson Combat Professional in 9mm Central Florida/Space Coast

I am selling a 2006 Wilson Combat Professional in 9mm. I am the original owner of this gun and it has been shot very little. I would say less than 700 rounds total. It includes bag, original paperwork, test target and 3 9mm magazines as pictured.

Price is $1750 shipped to your FFL. NO TRADES AT THIS TIME. We can also do face to face for $50 off if I don't have to ship. You must have either your concealed carry permit or proof of recent firearms purchase. Otherwise buyer is responsible for transfer fees to run purchase through an FFL. Out of state purchases must go through FFL. I drive around the state a fair amount for work so I may be able to meet you close to where you live.

Please contact me with any questions, this is an excellent gun backed by Wilson Combat's lifetime warranty.

Comes with everything you see in the pic, gun, 3 mags, lock, brush, and the case.  I have only shot two rounds through this gun, so I cannot say it is new, but it don't get any closer. I have not carried this gun, it has been in its original pretty well all its life.  This glock does not have the rail on the bottom.

The only reason I am getting rid of this weapon is to consolidate calibers.
