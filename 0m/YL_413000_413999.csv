This is an awesome rifle and is a real show stopper. I have fired 25 trouble free rounds thru it (5 FMJ's to roughly get sighted & then Hornady A-max match only from that point), but just do not get the oppurtunity to shoot it very often. The rifle looks like new and needs nothing. Recoil is manageable w/ the muzzle brake & feels like a 3"" 12ga shot out of a light shotgun. The pics show the rifle with the bolt removed as I store in my safe with it out to save some room, but is in like new condition and obviously included just not shown in the pics. I will throw in some armor piercing ammo to get you started also. Scope and rings NOT included....just the rifle as it sits w/ bipod and 20-25 rounds of ammo. $2200 obo cash only.

I need to sale. I have over $1,500.00 in this rifle. I have here a built AR-15 chambered for 300 Blackout with Olympic Arms lower. The 300 Blackout round ranges from a 105 gr. supersonic round, to a 220 gr. subsonic round. It gives the size and power of an AK-47 on an AR platform and AR accuracy, long range, and dependability. The recoil is almost non-exsistent and it is suprisingly quiet, but packs a lot of punch. The ballistics of this round is amazing. It has a 16 in. Heavy Duty Stainless Steel threaded barrel with thread cover, pop-up iron combat sights, UTG Foldable Metal Foregrip, a BSA weaver rail mounted laser with pressure pad, a Barska 1x30mm Electro Holographic sights with a infra red crosshair reticle with a 3x30 Magnifier, 6 position adjustable butt stock, an ergogrip pistol grip, free floating weaver rail, 1 30 round Magpul pmag and 1 30 round factory mag."

Overview:

Remington brought the hunting-rifle prowess, and a leading manufacturer of modular repeating rifles introduced us to the 308 Win platform. What emerged is a masterwork of game-dropping performance and hunt-specific features that will load any camp’s meat pole with unrivaled efficiency – the new Model R-25. An advanced, highly lethal blend of accuracy, fast followups and light recoil chambered for three of today’s most popular short-action hunting cartridges – 243 Win, 7mm-08 Remington and 308 Win. This rifle is everything varmint and predator hunters love about our R-15 in a beefed-up design that easily handles cartridges suitable for big-game hunting.
For peak accuracy, its precision-crafted 20"" ChroMoly barrel is freefloated within the machined aluminum fore-end tube. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block keep weight to a minimum and facilitate rapid heat dissipation. The barrel also features a recessed hunting crown to protect the rifling and aid in more consistent bullet flight. When it’s time to make the shot, the R-25’s ergonomic pistol-grip gives you unmatched control and rock-steady aim. As a whole, this rifle has a balanced, stable design that makes it deadly from the offhand position. True to our hunting market, the traditional two-stage trigger found on AR-platform rifles has been exchanged for a crisp, single-stage version that comes from the factory set at 4 1/2 to 5 lbs.
Its carefully tuned upper and lower are machined from rugged aluminum forgings. The entire gun is dressed in Mossy Oak® Treestand™ camo that makes it virtually invisible in the field. We included a 4-round magazine, and the R-25 is compatible with DPMS 308 Win-type magazines and accessories. front and rear sling swivel studs are installed.

Heres a description of the DAK:
DAK-(for Double Action Kellerman, after the designer of the system). When firing the pistol the first trigger pull is only 6.5 lbf (compared to 12 lbf for the standard DAO). After the pistol fires and the trigger is released forward the trigger has an intermediate reset point that is approximately halfway to the trigger at rest position. The trigger pull from this intermediate reset point is 8.5 lbf. If the trigger is released all the way forward, this will engage the primary trigger reset and have a trigger pull of 6.5 lbf. To engage the intermediate reset the trigger must be held to the rear while the slide is cycled, either manually or by the recoil of a round being fired.

In bare-bones description, the DAK mechanism provides a hammer-fired full-length double-action trigger pull, with complete repeat-strike capability, that is notably lighter than other full-length DAO pull mechanisms. Developed by the engineers at Sauer in Germany, the new DAK trigger system delivers a smooth, consistent 6.5-pound full-length trigger pull that is much closer to the weight of a Glock than any conventional DAO but also has complete restrike capability without any pretensioning or prestressing of the internal firing mechanism. There is nothing magical about the design; everything is accomplished by simple mechanical advantages in the trigger/hammer linkages. The key is that the engineers were able to extend the ""leverage arm"" of the hammer from the pivot point (like sitting farther from the fulcrum of a seesaw) so that less force is required from the trigger while remaining within the existing dimensions of the P226 and P229 frames. Externally, the only visible difference between a SIG DAK mechanism and a conventional SIG DAO mechanism is that the DAK trigger has a slightly slimmer profile and the DAK hammer sits completely within the frame when at rest, while the DAO hammer protrudes slightly. Other attractive features include the fact that the slide must be locked back and the magazine removed to disassemble, and it can be disassembled without having to pull the trigger."

However this was my personal gun and was a labor of love. You can see why I called it my ""movie Gun"" We have had so many people order this configuration and variations on it that we decided to offer it on GB on a regular basis. It's expensive but well worth the money.
We have even Teflon coated the entire gun for a few of our clients. Optional at extra cost.
Here is a list of what has been done.
First the FCG has been moved forward and a US Made FCG with a polished and re-profiled FCG has been installed for a smoother action and better reliability with low brass.
An Over Travel Limiter was added to the FCG. This gives a faster recovery for the next shot.
A new hammer spring was also used for the same purpose and results in a trigger pull of less than 3 lbs.
A Tromix Trigger guard installed and modified to fit the Hogue grip.
Bolt and Carrier were ground, reworked and polished as well. This gun will load on a closed bolt and has a real smooth action.
In addition the extractor has been modified, the feed ramp cut and polished, the rails polished, the extractor ramp modified, the BHO modified, the internal springs for the hammer and recoil changed and the BHO spring modified.
The gun has a Custom Aluminum Black Powder coated fore grip made for us to our specs. At 3, 6, 9 o'clock rails can be added and are an optional add on.
It has a Custom barrel shroud that has been designed so that a brake such as the Tromix shark brake which is included, can be used with the shroud."

If the trade is right, and not a 9mm, I also have about 125 defense rounds I will throw in, (about 75 115 gr Zombie Max, and about 50 127 gr +p+ Winchester Ranger T's), as well as 100 rounds of Winchester white box 115 gr FMJ's. If the ammo goes as well, I believe I have two or three hard plastic 9mm ammo boxes. Can send more pics"

I am selling the gun because my interests have changed, I do not need to sell it so do not try to ""low ball"" me with a price that is no where near what I am asking.  The only thing I would consider for trades would be revolvers, preferably either Smith & Wesson or Colt (not SAA).  
I have seen this same gun go on auction for $4000+ so my price is reasonable.  The box has sold on e-bay for $500, the grips are worth over $1000, the clip is worth $500, so when you total everything up the price is worth what I am asking.
I do not have picture ability, send me your questions and we can set up a place to meet for you to see it.  I will accept cash only, or trade plus cash.

It is essentially in brand new condition other than being fired around 200 times, and cleaned and oiled about 3 times after each use.

The Glock comes with the Glock case, 2 mags, a speedloader, gun lock, and a bore brush with the plastic removable handle that can also be used with cleaning rags. I will also throw in a few paper targets, the ammo I have left over (probably at least 50 to 100 full metal jacket rounds), a Blackhawk holster, and if you would like, possibly 2 winchester over the ear style headsets for ear protection.

The adhesive on the foam on one side of the Glock gun case has come loose, but I'm sure it could be re-glued, and no one is probably buying this for the case anyways.

This gun looks AWESOME!  The new upper was functioned checked with 10 shots and operated flawlessly.

The lower is a Plum Crazy high impact polymer, like anything Magpul or Glock pistols, it is very light (1LB, 11oz), durable, and fairly inexpensive.  This is a USED lower and I put the condition at 95%, I can see no scratches or for that matter any imperfections worthy of noting.  This was one of my personal lowers and I estimate that I may have shot 150 to 200 bullets at the most with it.  My overall impressions are that it was very good lower for the price.  I was especially impressed with the PCL proprietary trigger, it was very crisp with hardly any “take up” or “creep”.   

Weapon Specs: 
•	(New) 16” Heavy profile barrel for very accurate shooting 
•	1/9 twist barrel in 5.56mm caliber 
•	(New) free floated hand guard, a standard for AR accuracy. 
•	(New) Alexander Arms Tungsten Cerakote painted upper.

        Cerakote are included in this sale.  
•	(New) YHM Specter gas block
•	6 position M4 Collapsible Stock
•	PCL lower (used in 95% condition) 
•	Reversible safety to accommodate right or left hand shooters.

The optic shown is a new Vortex SPARC red dot and complements this weapon very nicely.  In my opinion for the money it is one of the best optics made.  For additional $200.00 I will include the Vortex Optic pictured on this carbine .

Optic features:
•	One-Piece Tube Fully Multi Coated Lenses 
•	Waterproof and Fog proof
•	Unlimited Eye Relief
•	Adjustable Dot intensity with a Night Vision mode 
•	Screw-in 2xMagnifier for long distance shooting 

I am asking $725 for the complete rifle(NO OPTIC!) or $925. “WITH” Vortex optic. 

For the right price I will consider selling just the upper, lower, or swapping out the PCL for a NEW Spikes Tactical with all mil-spec parts.  There is all kinds of options I can do just let me know how you want your rifle.  

This is a personal sale so there is no FFL transfer or sales tax.  Within reason, I will meet with you to view this carbine.  Serious inquires only, I can provide additional photos to your email.

History and Condition 
This is an amazing scope and is sold everywhere for $1699 with an MSRP of $2125 

I bought this scope in early July and received it on July 7th. (It is 7 months old) 
It was mounted on Seekins rings with a wheeler scope mounting kit on top of my LR-308 and torqued to Seekins spec. 
I shot exactly 140 rounds through it and it has sat in my safe. 
This is a bit too much scope for me, and a bit too pricey for me. I am selling it to recoup money spent so I can go to a cheaper one and afford ammo to feed the rifle. 

The glass is perfect. I've never cleaned either the front or rear glass. In the pictures there are some white specs. That is the reflection of my recessed ceiling light,
and another decorative light. There are NO scratches. 

The body has some slight ring marks, more noticeable on the bottom than the top. 

Items for Sale : 
I have the original box as well as the original shipping box. 
I have a Leupold rear flip up cap. I do NOT have the front cap. I think I removed it at the range the first day out and forgot to take it home with me. 
It is a butler creek flip-up and can be easily replaced.

70 Series 1911's.......... I don't own anything else... 
That said, Here's a nice pistol for your consideration.

It was born a  2008 Black Duty Coat 23rd off the line.
They did not make a  Stainless Factory model in 08. I had it black for a long time and wanted something tougher than that duty coat. So ......

The gun is in excellent condition. The sights are bright. They may have some wear on the edges from some carry time but the rest of the gun is wearing a mint new finish. 
There is no rust or pitting, nothing,  that I can find. 

I took it to Jeff Abernathy and had a Trigger Job, installed an EGW ""E"" trigger and a properly fitted EGW sear. He did a great job as always.
Was breaking when we did it that day at 3.25 and it's a nice clean break. That E trigger feels great, and jeff's awesome.


It's wearing  Grips Larry Davidson ""Shredders"" in Black G10.*

The barrel is the original Match Grade barrel highly polished and then Black Ionbond Treatment done. It looks great. No marks, slick glossy black.
The barrel was treated prior to the frame and slide so it has about 100 rounds down it. 


The entire slide and frame has been done in Silver Ionbond. That is not Stainless. It looks like a nice stainless but add a little metallic and looks nice and silky to the touch.

The magazine has been done in the same Silver Ionbond as the gun. 
I has been inserted and shows light marks but that's it. It's original, real Checkmate from DW.

Just for a touch of class, note the Bushing Plug....

The gun runs nice and is very accurate. It puts the standard Bead  Blast stainless 2010 to shame. The finish is smooth.


I take very good care of my 1911's. If you have need of more photos or would like to have the pistol email me. Be happy to help. I don't have the original box. I do have it in a range bag you can take. You will like it.

Don't kick the tires.
I need cash, not trade. 
I do have grip upgrades as mentioned below.

But like it sits in the photos is what you get for your money.
One Sweet ass 1911. Please bring references I want to know she's going to a good home ...... he he he

This is NOT an AK converted Saiga.

This is a factory Saiga with a Tapco stock and grip bolted on. This is not a conversion kit and it cost $60 on Amazon.


So you have $650 on a $460 rifle? 

Reason I know the difference: Conversion kits completely deposition the trigger group and pistol grip. This kit comes with a different higher quality trigger group. This conversion kit cost anywhere from $80-$100.

But wait, so with a REAL conversion kit, and a NIB rifle, it would only cost $480-$500. Where do you get off pricing it at $650? 

Proof? The two pics at the bottom. The one that is actually converted has the trigger group right next to the magazine. The other is his ""AK converted"".

I have done several of these conversions and know the Saiga well, People, don't fall for this guys bold faced lie, stay smart."
