Beretta Px4 Storm Type F Compact 9mm

The Beretta Px4 Storm is a semiautomatic pistol designed for concealed carry and personal defense. Borrowing features from predecessors like the Beretta M9 and Beretta 92 it is rapidly proving itself as a suitable option for law enforcement (both on and off duty) private security forces and responsible citizens. 

Checkered grips on all models provide a sure grip in less than optimal conditions and three backstraps (included with every pistol) can be swapped for comfort and fit. The design is based on that of the M9 and 92 and the Px4 Storm cannot be improperly assembled due to distinctive parts and one-way fit. 

An ambidextrious safety (thumb operated decocking lever) prevents unintentional discharge in the event the gun is dropped. High capacity double stack steel magazines provide enough firepower for self defense and law enforcement. A non-glare coating on the slide resists corrosion and stands up to the abuse expected in the line of duty.

Colt LE6940 AR15.  The box has never been opened.  Full details and pictures are available at the following link from the manufacturer:

This rifle is an M4 Carbine LE6940 with a monolithic quad rail upper. The upper assembly is equipped with a 16inch chrome lined barrel, 1 in 7 twist. The barrel also has the M4 profile with M4 feed ramps as well.  There are two Colt 20 round magazines, a sling, two quick disconnect sling rings, cleaning brushes with rod assembly, three ladder covers and an owners manual included. The upper is the one piece monolithic quad rail and comes with a Maytech flip up rear sight that is fully adjustable. The stock is made by Colt and has the military four position stops on the buffer tube. The buffer tube is forged military spec and will accept after-market stocks sized for mil spec tubes. It is factory equipped with the H buffer and M4 bolt carrier assembly. The push pins are the standard size as used on all Government rifles and the trigger and hammer pins as well. Please note there are no steel blocks or pins in the auto sear area. The bolt has the standard M16 carrier and the Magnetic Particle Colt MPC inspection stamp. The original box, sleeve and paperwork are included. Once again, this is a new in the box Colt M4 carbine - and has never been opened."

The factory trigger assembly was replaced with the Red Star Arms fire control group which includes an adjustable trigger - the user can adjust it - and a properly configured hammer for the SAR-3. The factory hammer was known to cause uneven wear on the bolt in these rifles and they also suffered from trigger slap, so this is and incredibly important upgrade on the SAR3. The original FSB was replaced with an original Romanian threaded 22mm front sight base and a US-made copy of the Romanian muzzlebrake by AK-USA. All parts were installed by Troy at InRange in Kodak, Tennessee. Troy installed everything and then parkerized and painted the rifle. I don't think anyone interested in AKs can question the high quality of Troy's work. The finish is smooth, even, and looks phenomenal, especially compared to other AKs. The muzzlebrake and FSB are fully functional as designed (plunger and spring to lock the brake in place upon tightening) and the muzzlebrake is fully removable.
The furniture is laminated wood from Russia with the exception of the laminated repo handgrip which is US made. The furniture was professionally refinished with an authentic Russian look, Includes two 30 round waffle mags, $1200 obo, Huntsville area."

More about the gun:

It is a complete romanian PSL 54 (don't know if the numbers are matching, or even what that necessarily means) that I had bought new a few years back and never got around to shooting. I shamefully bought it and it just sat in the safe after I cleaned and oiled it upon receiving.  It includes:  the rifle, scope (the luminescent reticle is no longer active as far as I can tell), the canvas/leather kit bag that includes some cleaning kit and other things, and 2 magazines.

I can also include, for the right offer, a 440 round can of bulgarian ammo (i believe it's something like 147 gr) and 2 or 3 more mags.

Once I get a better idea what prices are nowadays, I'll update this listing as well as taking some pictures.

If you have a PS90 or some other neat bull pup type guns, I might be interested for trade.  I'm not interest in AR15 that are temporarily priced to the freaking moon (I already have a couple I bought from the past few years).  I might also be interested in a well built, well thought out long range gun.  No other trades unless you have a 2010+ Ducati Multistrada you want to get rid of for some reason  haha

Guns & Ammo says:
The CA-15 is the most technologically advanced AR-type rifle in existence. This superlative has been earned with its unprecedented use of materials, ergonomics and refined push-rod system. The gas block wears a corrosive-resistant Melonite treatment. Carbon fiber reduces weight and vibration to the handguard and barrel without compromising rigidity, and a proprietary flash suppressor is forged from titanium"

The scope is approximately $500 (http://www.midwayusa.com/product/171474/leupold-vx-2-rifle-scope-4-12x-50mm-lr-duplex-reticle-matte). The only difference between the link and the scope I have on the rifle is that the rifle's scope has a standard duplex reticle.

The Magpul accessories retail for about $200 combined. I'm pretty sure I still have the original round handguards and will throw those in as well if I can find them."

First off, the electric guitar was made by Jarrett Guitars, 50 guitars were scheduled to be built in the limited, but only 40 ended up making the production run. Commemorative Series and this is guitar number #19 in the series, serial number CSX2002-34 . The Guitar comes with certificate of authenticity from JARRETT GUITARS, CONNECTICUT USA. A rare piece both for collectors and players, and an extremely unique piece for Shelby Cobra fans. 22 frets, humbuckers, 3 way selector switch. Volume and tone controls push/pull to split the coils in the humbuckers. Set neck with pearl inlays, and custom Shelby Cobra graphics. If you Google this guitar and read the Harmony Central reviews, you will discover just how amazing this guitar really is. This guitar has lived it's life in it's case which is included. The guitars sold in the 4k-8k range due to the limited number made and have never seen one that was autographed. It was played one time by a professional musician to get feedback on the quality, which as expected, was very impressive to him.

As for the autograph, being a '68 Shelby Cobra GT-500 owner I have attended several events at Boulder Colorado's ""Shelby American Collection"" museum. Mr. Shelby signed this at one of the annual Christmas benefits (December, 2007) and all monies collected from the benefits were donated to help operate the museum and to the Carroll Shelby Foundation (http://www.cscf.org/). As such it comes with a certificate of authenticity from them. I had Mr. Shelby inscribe it to me and my name can easily be removed with just rubbing alcohol because the inscribed signature was done with a Sharpie and since the guitars finish has several layers of clear coat built up on it, the Sharpie couldn't have penetrated through the finish. I am the original owner of the guitar and have owned it for 7 years. I have rarely come across these guitars and have never seen one that has been autographed. As you know Mr. Shelby has passed away and therefore I wouldn't anticipate a signed example making it to the market..

To get an idea of value's you can check out these current auctions for similar guitars, first ones aren't autographed, second one is but a different type. It's just to give an idea, I don't need any insulting low ball offers, I paid a lot of money just for the opportunity to own this rare guitar...

Scientifically designed to work with dry or wet hands, with or without tactical gloves, the X-Tac pattern redefines secure shooting comfort and gunhandling without the coarse, often painful nature of other grip treatments. In tandem with our G-10 Starburst grips, the X-Tac tread pattern locks securely into the firing hand and will reduce muzzle flip without snagging on clothes or cover garments. The X-Tac proudly wears our newest rear sight, the Wilson Combat® 1911 Battlesight. This high profile rear sight has a .145” wide U-Notch for optimum sighting in low-light, dynamic range conditions. The rear blade of the sight is serrated, while the notch area is recessed into a semi-circular pocket for a crisp, protected sight picture.

This is a  micro-compact 9mm automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. 
A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

I love the feel and accuracy of this gun, and I'm sad to see it go, but I need to prune my collection for financial reasons.  Definitely has the sleekness and classic James Bond 007 feel, but an extremely light aluminum frame.  I carried this gun for a little while and it was almost like it wasn't there.  The 3-dot sights are also very good and it has a very natural grip-feel.  This gun was VERY popular with all my lady friends...even the grumpy brute of a woman at the gun desk of the local cop shop fell in love with this thing.  Women love this gun."

These are genuine Russian made AK47 rifles in the always popular 7.62x39 caliber. They are built at the Izhmash Factory in Russia (Legion subsidiary) and re-manufactured by Arsenal Inc. in Las Vegas into the configuration you see now. The Arsenal SGL21-61 is one of the best AK47 rifles available outside of the Russian military. They are among the very few AK-47 rifles that use brand new Hammer Forged and Chrome Line barrels. The SGL21-61 is as close as one can get to a genuine Russian Military AK-103 here in the US, making it one of the highest sought after AK 47 rifles on the market.

Or from the Antigun point of view. It is the most evil of all rifles because it is a combination of a AK and AR. It is a AK platform that was built to shoot the bullets from an AR-15. This gun shoots .223.  It is a precursor to the WASR series.  Hard to find.  It comes with 2 30 round steel German Weiger magazines and 2 30 round Bulgarian Circle 10 waffle magazines.

At some point a folding stock was added to it.  I have a AK-AR style colapable stock that has ever been used that also comes with it. 

It shoots perfectly. Hardly any kick to it all all.

I purchased this pistol two years ago as a collector's item due to the difficulty in being able to get this pistol (which is still the case today).  Pistol is unmarred and shoots beautifully.  Although it looks and feels like a toy when you first pick it up, it has tremendous firepower and each magazine holds 30 rounds of 22 Mag ammo.

OTHER INFO ON PISTOL:  For those of you familiar with this pistol, you know how difficult it was getting one and for many, the ones that were available were going for 2 - 4 times the actual cost of the pistol.  I purchased mine at a price of $700 via auction.  I've since added 4 more magazines for a total of 5.  I've also acquired an additional barrel so now you have two versions of the barrel.  PLEASE NOTE:  This particular PMR-30, serial number W0151 has NOT experienced any misfire or any other issues.  This is a superb copy of the pistol.  The ammo include features 50 rounds of CCI Maxi-Mag 22 Magnum ball ammo and 350 rounds of BVAC rounds of 40 grain hollow point rounds.

REASON FOR SELLING:  I was beginning to amass too great a collection.  Since I'm now retired and not shooting as much, having all of these firearms does me no good.  Again - this is the only 22 Mag pistol available and this one is a beauty!!!

ASKING PRICE:  $700 (firm).  Cash only.

OTHER PURCHASING INFO:  Interested buyer will then accompany me to a local gun store to complete proper transfer of registration.  So if you want this pistol and don't have a concealed carry permit (CCP), you will need a Pistol Permit.  Once you have the pistol permit, we can then complete the transaction at the gun store.  If you have a CCP, then it's much easier to just go to the store and complete the transfer.

The M1935 is a single-action semi-automatic blowback pistol that fires the .32 ACP ammunition. It is made out of carbon steel with plastic grips. It is fitted with a manual safety and when the last shot has been fired the slide is retained open by the empty magazine. The magazine capacity is 8 rounds. As this pistol was built for the Italian army, all parts were interchangeable, which simplified maintenance and manufacturing: a first at the time.   This gun has the 4UT acceptance mark on the tang which means it was sent to Nazi Germany in 1944.

Fitted with the Beretta style open slide, the M1935 has a very reliable feeding and extraction cycle. It was made with few parts and is very simple to maintain. The M1935 is a very robust construction with long service life if properly maintained.
