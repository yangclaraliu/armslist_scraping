 This may be your last chance. I was in a local firearms retailer this week. There backlog of AR orders is 38. Yes 38 and that was 1 out of 5 or 6 local stores. So imagine how many are on backorder across this great country? They said before the last 2 months they were receiving and selling 10 or so AR style rifles per week and now they are only receiving 1-2 per week, if any. So getting on a backorder list is far from a guarantee as they could be BANNED before you would receive one."

The only mod I made was the pistol grip, but I still have the original pistol grip in case you want everything to be as it was. You also have the owners manual, the sling, the 5 round magazine, and 3x aftermarket 30 round magazines. You also get the gun case for it and about 100 rounds of quality brass ammo (not the crappy surplus or steel ammo). 

It shoots like a dream. For those that don't know, these are amongst the highest quality AK's you can get. These were built in Egypt, but the factory was set up by the Russians, so everything is up to spec of the original AK's.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!"

1. A home defense gun, 20 inch plain barrel and choate extension magazine in the off season. 
2. A skeet and trap gun. I have a 26 inch barrel with Full, Modified, IC chokes. 
3. Deer gun, using the cantilever barrel with a Nikon Shotgun scope 3-7x. Using Remington CoreLokt Ultra's I have stretched this out to 150 yards to take a deer. Can hit a pie plate all day at this range. 
4. I use it as a Turkey gun by changing the stock and forearm to Camo and using the Remington Super Full Turkey choke. This give you about 85% of #5 pellets in a 2 foot circle at 30 yards. 
5. I also have a Hastings black powder barrel this is quite rare and have taken deer out to 100 yards. I use 2 pyrodex pellets and a CCI 209. Works like a champ. This is the receiver scope mount that goes along with this set up. 

This shotgun has been used and shows some minor wear and tear, I am very easy on my stuff and take good care of it. All pieces are in perfect working condition and are included in the price."

P245 is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It uses a typical Browning-style cam operated barrel, which locks into the ejection window in the slide. The slide is made from stamped steel, and has a separate breechblock held within the slide by the cross-pin. The frame is made from aluminum. The trigger is double action, with external hammer and a decocking lever on the left side of the frame. There's no manual safety, but P245 is provided with automatic firing pin safety.

This is by far one of the sweetest 308 Sniper packages you will ever lay your hands on. It started out as a DPMS AP4 and then evolved into a precision piece of equipment as per the picture with a 5 shot group of Lake City M80 7.62 x 51 at 100 yards. 5 shots that can be covered up with a quarter is sub MOA accuracy. Professionally Duracoated with Magpul Dark Earth color $250, front Troy Modular Battle rail extended $375 along with gas block changed out and front A2 sight removed for optics, the Chrome BCG with BCG charging handle $275, Magpul handle $35, Magpul UBR stock $275, Magpul forward grip $35, SCOPE HAS BEEN REMOVED,SCOPE MOUNT REMOVED, Primary Weapons Systems flash hider $125, Urban 2 point sling $75, BIPOD HAS BEEN REMOVED, 4 High Capacity Factory DPMS Mags (20 Round Mags) It comes with most of the boxes and manuals. This weapon has had fewer than 500 rounds put down range and is looks absolutely flawless.

Neos means ""new"" in Greek, and Beretta's American design staff started with a clean sheet when drawing up this new line of .22 pistols. The lines are meant to appeal to a new generation of shooting enthusiasts who are respectful of the past while bringing a fresh attitude to the shooting sports. The Neos pistols feature cutting-edge design, modular construction that allows personalization and the flexibility for many shooting disciplines. Available at popular prices, the Neos is ideal for new shooters, but it won't easily be outgrown as skills improve. 

SOPHISTICATED.
In the unmistakable design and style of Giugiaro. The valuable collaboration between Beretta’s engineers and noted Italian designer continues to fruition. The sleeker and ergonomic U22 Neos with its captivatingly designed gun case is guaranteed to appeal to Beretta enthusiasts.

MODULAR.
Constructed of five assemblies which are easily disassembled without tools, the U22 Neos is manufactured in the classic Beretta blue or inox to satisfy the tastes of all shooters. The ergonomic grips in fiberglass reinforced technopolymer with anti-slip finish can be substituted with optional colored or rubber inlay grips.

PERFORMING.
Reliable, durable, easy to maintain and notably precise thanks to the 6” barrel featuring an integral rail that accepts Weaver style scope mounts, and a fully adjustable target rear sight.
The firearm is also equipped with a cocked firing pin indicator at the rear of the pistol. The single stack magazine made from inox steel (with a 10 round capacity) boasts a practical device which facilitates loading.  The ambidextrous manual safety can be engaged either with the firing pin cocked or uncocked."

Includes 4 magazines! Barrett M107A1 29"" Barrel Semi-Auto .50BMG Description from Website: It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough. Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor. The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold. Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle’s durability. Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is easily adjustable from either side. The M107A1 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that’s optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning. Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference."

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

That's one step from absolute perfection. The set has coins from 1986 through and including 2012. This set DOES include the KEY DATE 1996 coin, which had a mintage of roughly 3 million coins (compare that to the over 30 million produced in 2009 and 2010). This is a fantastic opportunity to purchase every single year of the US Mint's Silver Eagle program and have the quality assurance from one of one of the two most prestigious grading companies, the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation. They guaranty the authenticity of the coins as well as the quality of these coins. NGC (tracks auctions and selling prices of each coin) currently values the set I am offering at $1,566.90.

Please submit serious COLLECTOR offers only. I'm not hard up for cash, so don't low-ball me. I've already sold one set for my asking price just last week. This is not a scrap metal sale, nor should you expect to turn a quick profit by purchasing this set - this is not that kind of offering. 

It took me a long time and countless hours to put together this near-flawless (MS70 would be flawless) set of coins and I will not break it up as there is a great deal of added value in having the complete set over simply random years. Once you see this set, you will want it. Once you own this set, you will never let it go. It is a thing of beauty and the plastic cases mean they will stay that way. Protect yourself from the non-stop printing of the US dollar and the likely inflation that's well on it's way (look no further than Greece, my friends) - own precious metals such as this American Silver Eagle set.

I look forward to hearing from you."

I have two (2) Glock .45 magazines, 13 round. I had ordered two magazines for my Glock 23, and I got the wrong ones. Please note that I don't know exactly what they fit (Gen 4, etc), so please be sure to look at the pictures, as I don't own a .45 Glock. I tried returning them, but the company doesn't have their crap together and they can't even get the return labels right. 

I am going to upload the back side of these mags because of the fit and it will not allow me to upload more (because of the size). I will send all the pics upon request that include the front and sides. 

I know everyone is getting...taken...by a lot of high prices over just about everything. 

I will be willing to take $77 for both. Firm. I know that is high, and I'm sorry. I can't get my mags for a reasonable price, or even find them, so I decided I would charge that price for the ammo that I want to buy. 

I am willing to ship, I suppose it would cost about $3 extra? Not sure, but I will go with that. I would have to get money by PayPal first if I do that, which I would put it in the mail the same day I get the money.

I picked it up off a friend about a year ago and just don't shoot it enough to want to keep it. He did some trigger work on it and installed the aftermarket bolt catch. He was big into accuracy and used it as a practice gun until he got reloading equipment for his 5.56.

The gun shoots fine, I never really got it zeroed in (like I said I really haven't shot it much) but its got a Bushnell 3x9 power scope mounted. I'm not sure what specific model or anything but I do like the reticle. The tactical model comes with the factory threaded barrel with a flash hider/ thread protector. Its ready for a supressor (if you can afford it). I have one factory 10 round mag and one Ruger BX-25 25 round mag for it. In case you live under a rock, the BX-25 mag will likely be outlawed soon so get em while you still can. I also have the barrel band (not installed in the pics) if you want it, just let me know."

THE WORLD’S FASTEST TACTICAL SHOTGUNS
The SLP™ (Self-Loading Police) shotgun is the world’s fastest cycling tactical shotgun. The smooth gas-operated action offers exceptional reliability and substantially reduced felt recoil for the fastest possible follow-up shots; it makes the SLP™ ideal for 3-gun practical competition. The NRA American Rifleman Magazine named the SLP™ its Shotgun of the Year in 2009.

The SC 1™ Over/Under shotgun establishes a striking new standard in both performance and appearance that sets it apart from traditional over and under shotguns.  This first generation of the SC 1™ was designed for a small number of competitors and die-hard FN owners, but with  enormous amount of interest  from customers there are already  plans for producing a second generation of the shotgun."
