I just bought a 2013 Chevy Silverado and had a lift kit and new wheels & tires installed.  The stock wheels & tires are now sitting in my garage collecting dust, so this is your oppertunity to get a great deal and not pay retail price!!!   The wheels & tires are stock Chevy 18"" 5 Spoke Machined Silver w/ Goodyear Wrangler P265/65R18 112T.  This package is brand new with only 18 miles on them!!!!  If you bought these from the dealership they would cost you approx. $2,100 without installation.  You might be able to find them online for around $1,700.  Will fit any 2007 - Present: Avalanche, Tahoe, Silverado, Sierra, Suburban.    I have all center caps and lugnuts as well.  
I'm asking $1,400 or OBO....

Also, don't argue with me that your Glock 30 is a full-size handgun because it's not.  (Yes, those were real offers).  Would consider a 1911 as long as it's not in the $800 range or higher.

NOTE: I do not sell junk. I have a 3 day policy on returns for cause. (i.e. not because your wife just said no, but if something is wrong with the rifle that I did not know about I'll refund or make it right - my reputation is more important than any sale.)

About the Seller: I am a licensed attorney and longtime advocate of gun rights. We have a right from God to self-defense. The Constitution of the United States and that of Ohio provides political protection and recognition of these rights. The second amendment has nothing to do with hunting; it is there to protect us from the number 1 mass murderer in all of history - tyrannical government. Thus, every responsible family leader really should have at least one decent military rifle. 

Terms of sale: All transactions will take place face to face in my law office in Delaware, Ohio. You must be a resident of Ohio and not have any prohibition limiting your ability to purchase and own this rifle. Valid driver's license is required, valid Concealed Carry license preferred. I do not make copies of this information as I will respect your privacy. Credit Card transactions are subject to a 3% additional charge (this is a pass along cost)."

I have two (2) and have decided to keep an A1, so I don't need this gun.  It is brand new and has only been taken out of the case for pictures.

There are three basic Bushmaster civilian models.  This one is desirable for most because it incorporates 2 adjustment dials for wind and elevation, but the carry handle on the upper receiver is removable so that you can mount any optics directly to the upper rail, or use it as an open site with the carry handle, and still zero it in well.  You can also use the carry handle as a riser and mount your optics to it.  There is a pre-drilled hole for the adapter.  If you prefer a quadrail foregrip, you can get one for about $70 and install it yourself, no gunsmith necessary.

Here are the specs on the gun:

-16"" M4 contour 4150 chrome moly-vanadium barrel is chromelined in both bore and chamber
-1:9 Barrel Twist
-Chambered for .223, but can shoot 5.56 as well.
-Features A2 birdcage-type flash hider to control muzzle flash
-Six-position telestock (adjustable) for light weight and quick handling
-Comes with a lockable hard case, operator safety manual, chamber flag, sling and 30-round magazine

I will meet you anywhere in the General DFW area (within reason).  The price on the gun is firm because I don't need to sell it.  I will, however, consider reasonable trades for other firearms or ammunition.  I will accept cash, gold or silver as payment.  The transaction must include a signed FIREARM BILL OF SALE, and I will need to see your driver's license to confirm your identity and age.  If you would like to execute the transfer through an FFL, I'm more than willing to do that, and I will pay the transfer fee.  This in not required by law, but it is good protection for both parties."

Full 12"" rail, fully customizable.  Brand new,  never fired.  It is hardy, has a good weight to, not a flimsy cheap AR15 plinker.  It has an adjustable gas block!  Bolt carrier group is internally chrome lined and a very solid trigger group.  Charging handle is unbelievable.  Very quick and accurate workings.  I am surprised that this rifle is as good as it feels.  Usually, it takes gunsmithing and some pricey extras to build a rifle to perform as what Ruger has done with their model.  An absolute tank and piston driven!

Taking offers, no low-balls.  Folks, this is a comp ready AR15.  No upgrades needed.  Just take this to the range and start shooting.  Already prepped and properly oiled and lubed. It includes some upgrades over the stock model.  It has flip-up sights, already zero'd with a laser bore sight!  Includes an upgraded trigger guard as well!  Like I said, this is ready out of the box!

Thank you for looking at my sale."

Firearms; Return Policy: 
VERY IMPORTANT - Please take your time to inspect all firearms thoroughly before proceeding with the firearms transfer process. Once a new firearm is transferred to you it is considered used, even if unfired. Consequently, we cannot provide a full refund for new firearms once they have been transferred into your possession. Also, we DO NOT reimburse FFL transfer fees on cancelled or refused firearms. We do understand that some manufacturer defects may not be identifiable upon initial inspection. However, upon discovering a defect after the transfer, the firearm must be returned directly to the manufacturer for replacement or repair (in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty policy). By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

This rifle is a clone of the E. German Weiger 940 Series of rifles, which is based on the reliable AK design.  This gun is manufactured by Cugir in Romania and imported by I.O., Inc.  This model uses the 5.56 NATO (.223 Rem) cartridge that the AR15 is based on, so you will not have any trouble finding ammunition for this gun.  The gun comes with original box, manual, cleaning kit, and sling.  The model in the 5.56 NATO round is no longer imported and has become much more valuable and rare to collectors.  Buy this gun while you can, because you may not find another like it.

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W, the SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

Firearms Return Policy: 
VERY IMPORTANT - Please take your time to inspect all firearms thoroughly before proceeding with the firearms transfer process. Once a new firearm is transferred to you it is considered used, even if unfired. Consequently, we cannot provide a full refund for new firearms once they have been transferred into your possession. Also, we DO NOT reimburse FFL transfer fees on cancelled or refused firearms. We do understand that some manufacturer defects may not be identifiable upon initial inspection. However, upon discovering a defect after the transfer, the firearm must be returned directly to the manufacturer for replacement or repair (in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty policy). By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

NOTE: I do not sell junk. I have a 3 day policy on returns for cause. (i.e. not because your wife just said no, but if something is wrong with the rifle that I did not know about I'll refund or make it right - my reputation is more important than any sale.)

About the Seller: I am a licensed attorney and longtime advocate of gun rights. We have a right from God to self-defense. The Constitution of the United States and that of Ohio provides political protection and recognition of these rights. The second amendment has nothing to do with hunting; it is there to protect us from the number 1 mass murderer in all of history - tyrannical government. Thus, every responsible family leader really should have at least one decent military rifle.

I have a brand new in box Bushmaster AR15 lower as well, and I will sell it for $400, if you need one to go with the upper. See my other listing: ""http://www.armslist.com/posts/972854/eugene-oregon-rifles-for-sale--bushmaster-ar15-carbine-lower""

 I also have 3 used 30rnd USGI magazines which have new springs and anti-tilt followers that I will throw in for an extra $60. They look a little worn, but have been completely reliable, and could always be painted if you wanted."

Firearms Return Policy: 
VERY IMPORTANT - Please take your time to inspect all firearms thoroughly before proceeding with the firearms transfer process. Once a new firearm is transferred to you it is considered used, even if unfired. Consequently, we cannot provide a full refund for new firearms once they have been transferred into your possession. Also, we DO NOT reimburse FFL transfer fees on cancelled or refused firearms. We do understand that some manufacturer defects may not be identifiable upon initial inspection. However, upon discovering a defect after the transfer, the firearm must be returned directly to the manufacturer for replacement or repair (in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty policy). By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

I also have a TON of higher end guitar equipment for sale / barter in relation to the right AR if interested.

I'm not looking for someone who thinks they can do it.  I know how to do it myself but I'm looking for someone who has experience and KNOWS they can do it because they've done it before.  This is going to be my primary deer rifle and I want something that is 100% top of the line.  I want your experience and your know-how.  If you've only done this one or twice then this is NOT FOR YOU.  If you know what you're doing then I want to hear from you.

Your job:

Replace stock with ATI stock (some sanding may be needed)
Install ATI scope mount (you will need drill press - but you already know this if you've done this before)
Install steel scope rings 
Install scope
Site in scope (will provide you ammo)
Install new trigger pull 
Grind off and re-blue the front site (and area) since it's no longer needed
Install new bolt handle from provided kit (will need machined)
Clean and lube gun from top to bottom
Check AND verify headspace - this is a must
Provide me with leftover parts unless you want to discount your service in exchange for these leftovers

My job:
Provide you with standard gun
Provide you with all of the above parts needed
Provide you with ammo to site gun
Pay you for your experience and time.  Will be willing to trade for mags, ammo, or best of all -- CASH.

If you can perform this, please contact me so we can speak.  I'm looking to make this my primary rifle and this is important to me.  We can trade/wheel N deal/ or I can just flat out pay.  

Looking forward to hearing from you."

Polish AK47 Underfolder, New In Box

This was a full-auto Iron Curtain Cold War military weapon from the Lucznik Weapons Factory in Radom, Poland. 

It looks nearly identical to the Russian.  Reddish wood laminate hand guards that widen at the palm.  The closest you get to that classic Soviet look.  Sexier than any Romanian, Yugo, Chinese or Egypian.

This rifle left Poland as a never-issued, complete machinegun, then the receiver was cut up and replaced with a Premium NoDak Spud.  Reassembled by Allied Armament in Oregon as a semi-automatic so it is legal to own.  And the trigger was upgraded to a Tapco No-Slap trigger.  

ORIGINAL MILITARY BARREL!  These are all but impossible to get.  No longer legal to import and those that made it here before the ban have already found their way onto the best of the kit guns.  This hammer-forged, chrome lined barrel is what makes this the real thing.  Accurate, durable, reliable.

""ASSAULT RIFLE"".  If you feel the way I do about the stupidity of the vilification of this rifle, then you will love the fact that it has ALL SIX FEATURES that define an assault weapon.  Any two of the following make it ""evil."" This has all six!

1. threaded barrel for muzzle attachments such as a grenade launcher.
2. Intechangeable magazines
3.  Magazine that holds more than 10 rounds
4.  Folding stock 
5.  Pistol grip
6. Bayonet lug

Includes original Soviet double welled oil bottle, cleaning kit and one classic steel 30-round combat magazine.
