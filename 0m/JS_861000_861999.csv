Finally finished the last one and I think they all look damn fine.  I enjoy doing it, and want to be able to do more, only issue is that I have no more stocks...so, if you have a wooden stock and aren't going to ever use it again, I'd love to take it off your hands.  I don't have much money, but let me know what you'd want for it, donor stocks will gladly be accepted.  I'd REALLY like a beater Remington 700 short action stock that will fit the 6mm BDL I was just given by my grandfather.  The stock on it currently is beautiful, and I'd like to have another one to put on it for hunting so I don't feel bad if it gets knocked around a little.

Also, if you have a stock that you would like brought back to life, let me know.  Bear in mind that I am no professional, but I've done a nice job on my 2 stocks, and would happily do yours.  Bonus for you- I'm no professional, so this comes cheap for you.  I will ask nothing up front, only that you don't rush me; this isn't a job for me, it's a hobby, and I do  have a job, a wife, and a 1 year old.  When I'm finished, you see the final product, and YOU determine what you want to pay me.  The last 2 I did took around a month to do, though the process could take less or more time, depending on how much spare time I have and/or what you'd like it to look like when completed.

THE 2010 CENSUS SHOWS NATION'S HISPANIC POPULATION GREW FOUR TIMES FASTER THAN TOTAL U.S. POPULATION

""The Hispanic population grew in every region of the United States between 2000 and 2010, and most significantly in the South and Midwest. The South saw a 57 percent increase in its Hispanic population, which was four times the growth of the total population in the South.
Hispanics in New Mexico comprised 46 percent of the total state population, the highest proportion for any state. Hispanics were 16 percent or more of the state population (matching or exceeding the national level) in eight other states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Jersey, New York and Texas.""

70mm (2-3/4"") and 76 mm (3"") cartridge case.

The shotgun is used to deliver single shots. It is reloaded automatically due to the energy of powder combustion gases bled from the barrel bore through the barrel port. The shotgun may be equipped with a sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation, which makes zeroing and firing at moving targets more convenient. The gas motive unit is adjustable to match the parameters of internal ballistics inherent to the standard cartridges and ""Magnum"" cartridges, as well. For the purpose of diversifying operational capabilities the shotgun may be equipped with muzzle adapters of different chokes, including the muzzle adapter ""Paradox"". (IZHMASH)"

Asking $400 or trade for one of the following:

- S&W 15-22 (I would add some cash for this trade and is my #1 preference)
- Sig/GSG 1911-22 (I would probably want a little cash along with this as a brand new GSG1911-22 is $300)
- P250 .357sig full size X-change kit (maybe a .40, though it would have to be a good deal as I would have to buy the 357 barrel still - would love the combo, though. As above, these are only $250 brand new, so I would ask for some cash with it)
- Sig522 (I would add some cash for this as well, but I don't think I would be willing to add as much as you would want - feel free to make an offer, though)
- Would also take 15 round P250 9mm magazine as partial trade, preferably with X-grip extension.

Possibly interested in other .22lr guns, feel free to make other trade offers for another gun - worst I can say is no thanks!

*NOTE:  Some .22LR, 9mm and other blowback style uppers use a groove in their BCG that is too narrow for the polymer hammer of the LW-15.  In these cases you will need to switch to a blowback style hammer also available in this product category.  The blowback style hammer, once installed, will run all rimfire and pistol uppers, and still work fine with standard mil-spec rifle uppers."

The wood has been well taken care of as well as the rest of the gun. I am selling it of course because of recent events. The market is as high as it is ever going to be and I can do a lot more with the money than I can with an extra AK. I know the price is high compared to what this rifle was a few months ago, but that is the reason I'm selling it now and not a few months ago. I get that some say it is price gouging but these rifles may no longer be available at all come a ban. I am not a motivated seller. That is to say, it will not kill me if I can not get rid of this extra rifle I have for the price I want. I am not a rock though, negotiations involving reasonable offers and trades will be considered. Cash & trade offers may also be considered. I will sell to the best offer. If someone outbids the list price, it is theirs period. I'm in it for the cash, make no mistake.
