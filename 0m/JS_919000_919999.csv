LaserLyte is a Laser Trainer Target that records where a laser hits the target, to save shooters time, money and ammunition. The Laser Trainer Target is ideal for novice or professional shooters and even instructors.

Learn shooting skills, such as unsighted fire, accuracy, grouping and trigger control. The Laser Trainer Target offers anyone the ability to practice shooting skills at almost any location, even a favorite recliner. Practice more often, become a more confident shooter and enjoy a lifetime of low-cost training with the LaserLyte Laser Trainer Target.

The Laser Trainer Target gives the user delayed shooting feedback, just like the shooting range, so the shooter can concentrate on the next shot instead of the last shot. To use the Laser Trainer Target simply aim at the target and dry fire the weapon with any LaserLyte Laser Trainer. To display impact, fire the laser at the red display circle on the face of the Laser Trainer Target. When finished, simply dry fire the laser aimed at the red reset circle to begin again with a fresh target. 



The 9mm Laser Trainer Cartridge offers a revolutionary way to train almost anywhere. The Laser Trainer Cartridge is the most realistic training option in LaserLyte's popular line of Laser Trainers with the choice to practice tap, rack, bang or malfunction drills. The Laser Trainer Cartridge fits inside the pistol chamber and features a firing-pin activated switch that indicates bullet impact with a bright red laser dot. For the cost of one or two visits to a local range, shooting enthusiasts can enjoy a lifetime of free training with the Laser Trainer Cartridge at the location that works best for them.
 The Trainer Cartridge easily installs into the firing chamber in seconds, works regardless of barrel length and does not stick out of the barrel. The Laser Trainer Cartridge activates for 100 milliseconds each time the firing pin strikes the cartridge. This modified cartridge is rimless, so the Laser Trainer Cartridge is not expelled during dry fire. A hardened rubber plunger on the laser also acts as a built-in snap cap to protect the firing pin and two rubber rings on the laser help ensure a proper fit in order to best replicate bullet impact for accurate training."

Colors used: Burnt Bronze on slide and Patriot Brown on frame.

This is a slightly used Glock 19 Gen 3 with top to bottom custom work.  I cerakoted the frame and slide, polish job and 3.5 disconnector on the trigger, brand new Trijicon cap sights, removed the finger grooves on the grip, added very aggressive stippling to the grip and contact points.  This gun feels fantastic in your hand and a positive, tight grip is achieved each time you handle it.  I stippled the grip and backstraps, underneath the trigger guard, and on the thumb rest just under the slide.  The trigger guard has been milled out slightly to allow a small indention for the weak hand to cradle into(stippled as well).  The grip extension has since been cerakoted to match the frame.

This is a beautiful, well-maintained, perfect condition shotgun. I fired six rounds through it to test it before I added the collaspible stock and shell holders and hung it up in my closet.

Obviously I'd rather just buy a damned box. I also may be interested (For the right price) on a few more boxes to fill my mags, and some to go shooting. Agian, for the right price.

So if you're one of the VERY few sellers on here that are not becoming vultures or are one of the people who happen to like all the posts I've been doing about those said vultures, please message me and let's work a deal out.

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Please be sure all the information on your driver's license is current so that we can accept that for identification purposes. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize we cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun.

If interested give me a text or call at REDACTED.

GUN #1
This is not your average AR15, this is a masterpiece. I turn more heads at the range with this gun than any gun I have owned. It is a factory built Daniel Defense DDM4 V7LW upper with a light weight cold hammer forged barrel and mid length gas system. I replace the factory charging handle with a Rainier Arms Raptor charging handle and the factory flash suppressor with a YHM Phantom.  It has Magpul Gen 2 back up sights and an EoTech XPS2. The fore end in the picture is wrapped in paracord solely for the purpose of being able to hold onto the HOT fore end during extended shooting sessions.  The lower is a factory built Spikes Tactical ST-15 with a Magpul STR stock, JP 3 lbs single stage polished match trigger, Magpul Bad lever, Hougue rubberized grip, and custom tungsten CeraKote (ceramic coating that greatly increase durability). I only coated the lower so the upper would shed heat as quickly as possible as the CeraKote acts as an insulator.  The gun has been very well maintained and has about 350-400 rounds through it. I am asking $3150. I'll be completely honest, this price is a couple hundred over what I paid for the gun but Daniel Defense products are great and rare and this is what the market has come to. Still this is no $1000 gun I'm trying to sell for triple the cost.

Gun #2
This gun is the rare ACR. It is a piston driven adaptive combat rifle (ACR) with a folding stock and free floating cold hammer forged barrel that boasts extreme reliability and accuracy.  It is completely factory except for it has the enhanced model folding stock and I added a Magpul vertical grip.  I can be completely broken down and stuffed in a  small back pack in about 2 min with no tools. I am asking $3350 for the ACR.

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Please make sure the information on your Ohio driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for identification purposes. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48. This listing will be deleted if the gun is sold.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize we cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

With four different platforms, each with great variety and functionality, they boast the perfect combination of proven design and reliability. Features include: rigid barrel/receiver connection; automatic bolt-hold-open latch; comfortable, rugged steel grip frame; contoured ejection port; easy-to-grasp tapered bolt ears; and rigidly mounted sights for consistent accuracy. Simply stated, Mark III Pistols offer the most versatility and value of any rimfire pistol on the market today.

Here is my Bushmaster AR15 223/556 (chrome barrel) up for sale; it has just about everything except bipod (may throw in tactical light/laser combo for good offer); less than 300 rounds through it over the years, and in excellent condition.  Eotech sight, collapsible stock, folding forend grip, 100 round Beta C-mag, 5-30 round magazines, plus just over 1,000 rounds of premium brass (mix of .223 and 5.56) only ammo.  Open to reasonable offers, and would like to sell as a package deal.  Thank you, and please provide your contact information when making cash offers.  Would like to sell this before this weekend's gun show.

Just to give you an idea of what I have invested (before tax, and before all the pre-ban hysteria)

-Bushmaster with minor customization was just shy of $1k 
-Eotech holographic sight, just under $500
-Beta C-mag (90 trouble-free rounds through it) $250
-1000+ rds of ammo, some HP, Penetrator, etc., avg of .50 per round, around $500+
-5-30 round aftermarket mags were $25 each, or $125 total
...will throw in the two ammo cans, you may need/want them, too.

Very open to reasonable cash offers (or maybe trade combinations with firearms or 'guy stuff'), not going to price-gouge anyone, (like those selling stripped down versions and off-brands on here 'new in box'...with a 200% markup). Conservatively speaking, I invested $2,375.00 before tax, but again, please be fair with your offers; would like to make a few bucks, but not going to be greedy!"

-Now drop-free compatible with magazine wells on the tighter side of acceptable tolerance, and has a reinforced mag catch area for greater durability and compatibility with various mag catch tolerances.
-A slimmer floorplate for increased pouch compatibility comes standard, along with improved water drainage.
-Improved texture on the front and rear for more positive handling under stress.
-Recessed paint pen dot matrix for magazine marking that will not abrade off under handling or cleaning. 


Currently mapgul has a backorder of over 1 million magazines, so good luck finding them elsewhere.
