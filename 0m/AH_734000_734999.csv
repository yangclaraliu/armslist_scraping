The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety."

144,http://www.armslist.com/posts/734144,For Sale:  40 cal Pennsylvania Long Rifle,"Eugene, Oregon, United States",$ 600,"Listed On: Wednesday, March 6, 2013",Muzzle,no type,no type,no type,Muzzle Loader,"I hate to get rid of this but I have lost interest and would like to see someone else get this and enjoy it as much as I once have.

This is a very unique Black Powder Rifle. It is a Pennsylvania Long Rifle, which is similar to the Kentucky Long Rifle (which, contrary to popular belief, was also made in Pennsylvania) except the rake angle on the butt of the stock is noticeably less.

I hate to get rid of this but I have lost interest and would like to see someone else get this and enjoy it as much as I once have.

Little history, as best as I have been able to deduce since there are no markings on the rifle:

This is a 40 cal Pennsylvania Long Rifle. (Not to be confused with a Kentucky long rifle, which was also made in Pennsylvania.) 

The barrel is probably over 200 years old and was most likely an original Flintlock barrel that may have (and probably was) mounted to a Flintlock rifle. It does have an extra set of dovetails that have been filed down, that would suggest it might have been. The barrel is rough worn with a browning finish (Typical of the late 1700's, and the barrel seems to have a very slight taper in the bore. (Not unusual with a hand bored barrel) There is also some nice ornate engraving on the end of the barrel which usually wasn't found on a lot of later weapons.

The rifle was breached for Cap & Ball probably between the 1840's or 50's. Probably not by a skilled gunsmith (Possibly an apprentice) as the barrel and breach were not matched cleanly.

The Trigger & Action, Brass Trigger Guard, Hammer, Brass Patch Box, Barrel Locks, and Brass Butt Plate are Probably Original to the 1840's or 50's.

The stock is probably not original and has sustained some damage and modification over the years but is still quite usable, as are the copper ramrod holders. (These are pounded out pennies) The brass tacks and nails decorations and the led nose guard are also more modern. The hammer is made of cast steel and is very brittle and it has been repaired twice. (this is the reason for the this gun currently being a wall hanger) If you were going to be shooting this rifle I would replace this with a more modern hammer and keep the original for display.

The Rifle does shoot very nicely and I was able to place a 4 shot group in 4 inches at 100 yards freestanding. However this rifle has been mostly a wall hanger for the past 15-18 years as I've lost interest in black powder shooting

I have been told, by more knowledgeable people than myself that this rifle could be worth upwards of $2000 to the right person. I don’t believe this and am asking only $600.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions though I don’t know what more I could offer. My number is REDACTED.

I would consider trades for other guns such as a Glock 23, a 308 rifle, a 357 handgun but would consider most any offer.

Thanks Mike"

I really like this gun but have two of them and would like to diversify my collection a bit with a makarov, tokarev, Cz-52, browning hp, or any other surplus gun you would like to trade. Send me an email with what you have and I will get back with you ASAP.

I may be signing another contract with the military and really don't want to get rusty.  Its life or death in that occupation and its important to keep the muscle memory with an AR-15.  I also want to have the capability of an AR for home defense for my growing family, but absolutely only if needed.  I hate the thought of pointing a weapon at another person but this is nature of the world we live in, I guess.  I'd rather be prepared than not.  I know its a really long shot but if you want to donate a weapon, it would make this Christmas unforgetable for me and I would be forever grateful.  I understand the world runs on money but it would really help me out alot, make my wife and family feel alot safer, and I could give my brother back the shotgun I borrowed.  You can trust me to be very responsible.  I spent a a good part of my life in the military and know how to handle a weapon.  Maybe Santa is listening.  I really hope so."

I could not get all of the dents out of the stock, but it looks pretty good for a 67 year old rifle.  
I have only put 8 rounds through the gun, and cleaned the bore after. It shot 2-3"" groupings at 100 yards. 
I added a rubber butt stock pad, and a cartridge holder on the stock(fabric that stretches over it).  The rifle comes complete with the folding bayonet.  
The bolt numbers do not match the receiver.

I am including a tool kit, which cost $15, and a 7.62x54r head space gauge.  I bought this to ensure the rifle was safe to shoot, which cost ~$25 dollars.  Also including the left over 12 rounds of ammunition(I bought a box of 20).

This model of gun is built to the performance center specs 629-6 Backpacker 44 mag, (2 staged trigger, houge grips, unfluted cylinder) and then it was shipped to big rock (or rocky mountain, or such...cant quite remember exactly, been a while.) manufacturer who did a full CUSTOM build on the gun for smith and wesson. This includes a 2.5 inch barrel, tapped receiver for optics, HI-VIZ sights, ported, and a 4lb double action, 2.4 lb single action, trigger job. They also added the laser etched Grizzly Bear and paw tracks on the cylinder. It is the smoothest revolver I have ever felt. It feels better then a blackhawk with a job on it in single action, and it rivals even the highest end double action pistols on the market today. And the best part is you dont even need to shoot it to impress people...its a beautiful gun that is twice as accurate and will last MUCH longer then the scandium models.

I am also including a full setup of ammo (300 premium rounds JSP, JHP, Gold Dots, and some shot shell for it as well) speed loaders, holster, the box and all the warrenty papers and information. Also I do have around 300 brass that I have collected shooting 3 other 44 mags.
The reason I am selling is I really want Assault styled rifles/pistols as either full or part trade. My hobbies have changed and instead of speading time in bear country I find myself at the range training in tactical situations. So my general list of guns I would like are high end Converted Ak47's/74s like Saiga, or Arsenal (would love a AK). 308 Semi guns, and most Ar15's. FN 5.7 pistol, 1911 stainless full sized. 10mm pistols like a delta or kimber. Or a ruger sr-10/22 (again training).

So getting down to brass tax, I am into this 1700$ and its my pride and joy. However I have carried it camping and because of this it has polish marks on a few spots. I have only shot it 100 rounds (50 180 grainers, 50 240 grainers) however at appraisal I received a 90-93%. (They are really really picky when it comes to high end smiths on this rating) On estimation I was told that It should hold a $$ amount on the market of 1000-1300 depending. However with everything I am valuing the whole package at 1100, or 1200-1300 in trade value (depending, such as if your gun has alot of wear or such, but I will be everything as fair as I can be). I understand times are hard, stuff is worth what people will pay, I really am in no rush, so price is pretty firm.

I will be checking my email every second I get, and I really want to get me something fun for Christmas to go out and shoot. I am a CCW holder and one of the good guys. I expect to sign a bill of sale and I would hope you would do the same. My cell is REDACTED, I will respond to text and to phone calls (leave a voicemail) and emails as best as I can. I only will do Face To Face sales...unless the buyer out of state makes the deal worth my while. Just too old to be dealing with out of state fees, damaged goods while shipping, ect.

Hope to hear from you guys,

Happy shooting"

Still in the box w/manuals.  Extra 30 round mag & two (2) magazine tandem rigs (can use these to put mags together side by side). 

What's cool is it isn't an AK. Much more accurate. But, out of the box was designed to get around a ban. No flash hider, pistol grip, etc... Can be tricked out to look like an AK (with flash hider... pistol grip... Tapco stuff for the Saiga shotguns work on it. Also EASY to service. I popped it all apart at the gun shop when I purchased it... Try doing that with an AR! Not sloppy ""rattley"" like an AK either.

As much as I like it, she wants it gone. Would consider trade for a nice 10/22 or other semi 22 for son... One of those GSG 22's. Might get by with a Ranch Mini... Dunno... what do you have? 

Also - 22 upper for an AR: friend said he would trade me for his stainless 10/22 and ""all the junk"" for a 22 upper if I could get one of those!!! REDACTED.

Daytime sale only - public place. Bill of sale if you want. Will be out starting the afternoon of the 21st - 27th. Would love to have it for Christmas.

Top pic is pretty much what it looks like now (w/ extra 30 mag & 2 mag coupler sets). Other pics are wht they look like tricked out.

When you fire this gun it's immediately obvious you're not behind a normal AR-15 in 5.56. It's got a kick to let you know there's a 50 cal bullet headed downrange. It is manageable though and is similar to shooting an auto 20g shotgun or maybe even lighter than that. This one was test fired by the builder and is an absolute blast to shoot. It runs like a typewriter and is incredibly reliable. 

These uppers have been sent to our troops in the middle east to use at Check-Points. If a vehicle refuses to stop they fire one of these giant bullets from their modified AR to instantly seize the motor and stop the vehicle."

The pistol is in great shape, probably 100-200 rounds through it total.

You will not find this in a shop here in town, and good luck finding an online vendor with it in stock. It will probably still have a 2-3 week wait, plus shipping, plus the FFL wait and fee. With an impending ban, just about every assault rifle and semiautomatic pistol is getting more hard to find and expensive.

Don't pay the prices that people think they can get out of their guns.  It's bullshit.  While I concur with federally having stricter gun laws when it comes to people with mental issues owning Assault rifles or any gun for that matter...... It should not change the fact that the normal man or woman can not able to own any gun he or she wishes to own.  Obama is manipulating our amendment rights to own guns. If you hand a person a pencil and he or she misspells a word... It is not the pencils fault... It is the person with the pencil in their hand. Don't take away our rights to own any gun because there are people out there who should not own them.
