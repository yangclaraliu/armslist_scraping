Believe all to have been used.  Not an expert on IDing AK mags, but three of them are definitely original Russian slab side mags stamped with the Izhvesk factory stamp, as well as other crylic stamps (exports to WP nations?).  These are in great shape for being 60+ years old, and as you all know, überrare!  One other mag looks to be EG (Maybe Polish judging by the follower!) and the other six are Chinese, although two of them have an ""O"" stamp on the mag locking tab (""Chugo""?).  Priced at below current values---if you can find them at all.  Concord this weekend had very few AK47 mags and they were going for $50 and above for run-of-the-mill mags.  Yes, they are are all pre-ban, and some of the CHICOM have air rust, though minimal.  They all work as intended.  Here are three caddies, a honda, and six corollas!  Come next Tuesday or Wednesday, prices will be doubling again---or not available for legal sale, when Obie signs his treasonous Executive Order.  Get them now!  After Tuesday, the prices will be doubled, as have prices on all semi-autos.  Concord was an eye-opener.

UPDATE:
OBAMA TODAY, 16 JAN 2013, JUST CALLED FOR CONGRESS TO LIMIT MAGS TO 10 ROUNDS AND BAN ALL ""ASSAULT WEAPONS""! IN OTHER WORDS, AR-15s AND SEMI-AUTO AKs TO NAME A FEW.  BUY THEM WHILE YOU CAN!  PRICES WILL KEEP GOING UP UNTIL THE BAN IS UNLEGISLATED LAW.

January 13, 2013



The head of the National Rifle Assn. expressed confidence Sunday that the current Congress will not pass a new ban on assault weapons, a major aim of gun-control proponents in the wake of last month’s killing of 20 schoolchildren in Connecticut.

“I would say that the likelihood is that they are not going to be able to get assault weapons ban through this Congress,” NRA President David Keene said on CNN’s “State Of The Union.”

Keene’s comments come two days before Vice President Joe Biden is expected to issue a series of recommendations to President Obama on reducing gun violence, and as gun stores in many areas report a dramatic spike in sales.

I like the feel of them and think they really improve the grip on the gun. If you wanted to take them off, they peel off cleanly. Also, I opted to remove the magazine disconnect. It isn't too difficult to put it back on if desired. I will also throw in the stainless steal guide rod and 20lb recoil spring I bought from gallowayprecision.com.

This rifle is a war horse - it shoots great, but does show some wear on the original stock and some minor cosmetic blemishes on some of the metal. The bore is in great shape and this rifle shoots great. The bayonet has no chinks and folds/unfolds easily. The rifle was imported by C.A.I. (Century Arms) and the numbers do not match, but that is not what I bought it for - I wanted a very dependable war horse and that is what this rifle is.

Included is the Tapco T6 Stock set in Earth green and includes the pistol grip, top hand-guard w/ Picatinny rail, and 6 position stock. This stock set was bought new from Cheaper Than Dirt and installed once then removed. 

Included is a BEC GoldLabel 3x9x42 Lighted Reticle Scope with BDC and is attached via an SKS Scope Mount to an extra receiver cover. For some reason, this receiver cover has a very small amount of ""play / slack"" in it (perhaps less than a millimeter or so) and with some minor work it could be corrected.

Also included is a NIP SKS Broken Shell Extractor (I never had any, so it is still NIP), a new metal ventilated Upper Hand-guard Cover, and 20 10-round Stripper Clips. I already melted the cosmoline off of them and they are new and unused."

Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us.

This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.

The lower is a new Troy Industries with a CAA buttstock.  This lower is a little snug fitting the P Mags but GI mags seem to fit just fine. (I've tried two different brands).  Upper is chambered in .556 with a 1/9 twist stainless steel barrel and a Midwest Idustries free float handguard.  Red dot is a Bushnell Trophy. I've fired this upper less than 200 rounds of mixed brass and steel case with no problems.  To my knowledge the Lower has never fired a round.

I'm selling to fund another project so not looking for any trades.  I will accecpt cash only.  FTF transaction or buyer will be responsible for any shipping charges FFL to FFL."

This Marlin Camp Carbine is a semi-automatic carbine chambered in 9mm (aka 9x19, 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger) manufactured by Marlin Firearms Company of North Haven, Connecticut. As the name implies, it was designed as a utility firearm to be used around hunting camps for foraging or defense. The carbine operates by direct blowback. The receiver is drilled and tapped for a scope mount. The original factory stock is made of walnut-finished Maine birch. The Camp Carbine uses a detachable magazine that inserts into the magazine well in front of the trigger guard. The Camp 9 rifle magazine can be replaced by magazines from 59-series Smith & Wesson pistols. The Camp 9 magazine well is sized for 12-round magazines; magazines with higher capacities extend beyond the bottom of the well. Numerous aftermarket magazines and drums are available for this model."

I know prices are going crazy, so I'm willing to part with up to $1200 or so, which is fair for most standard, basic rifles in the categories I just mentioned. Obviously $1200 won't buy a high-end RRA AR-15, but I'm also not desperate; the DPMS Sportical you bought for $700 30 days isn't now worth $2,000. Sorry. So, if you're on the ""buy it before it's banned"" bandwagon and just trying to make $2,000 off of your stock Mini-14, we probably won't be able to make a deal. But, if you've got a decent used semi-auto rifle for sale at a price that reflects the inflation of this panic-driven market while also not totally GOUGING people, let's see what you have.
