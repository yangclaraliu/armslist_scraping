Other than the primer and the propellant, this cartridge uses no explosives. It is a high-velocity, flat-trajectory cartridge designed for use against armored targets. The projectile section consists of a sub-projectile, a sabot assembly, and a cartridge case. The sub-projectile is constructed of a nickel-steel body that houses a tungsten core with an aluminum windshield and fin assembly. The sabot assembly consists of three 120-degree aluminum sections assembled to the sub-projectile. These are still in use today.

It is offered as I received it with the presentation box, extra magazine, owner's manual, barrel brush, and Factory 3 shot test firing target.  I am also including my Bianchi belt holster.

The HSc is in excellent condition having been fired not that much, somewhere in the low hundreds rounds.  It has always been a reliable loader, able to handle both roundnose and hollow point ammunition.  I loaded most of what I shot myself and found, like a lot of semi autos, it likes a heavier load.  The only loading issues I had was in firing low power lead rounds.

The only flaw found is on the right side of the slide between the American Crest and the serial number are a few pinpoint impressions made when I got clumsy one time.  They are very hard to see, small and can be felt only by my fingernail, not finger pad.

Bluing is excellent, barrel is excellent, and it's all here.  A nice collectible that is also a great carry."

421,http://www.armslist.com/posts/606421,For Sale:  FrogLube CLP,"Mentor and surrounding areas, Cleveland, Ohio",$ 11,"Listed On: Thursday, October 11, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"FrogLube 4oz. past is a 100 percent biodegradable lubricant treatment that is bio-based and safer than any petroleum-based product. Larry Lasky, former US Navy SEAL and President and Director of FrogLube. FrogLube™ must withstand the scrutiny of the most elite force under the most arduous conditions before we will introduce it”, stated Lasky, a 32 year veteran. We relied on the expert opinions of active SEAL operators who promptly extolled the virtues of FrogLube™. All who’ve tried it, have had the same reaction. They prefer FrogLube™ over the toxic petroleum-based products currently in use. In the end, the SEAL’s gear has got to work or they won’t use it.

Gun owners, military operators and competitive shooters demand a high degree of perfection when it comes to performance. Lasky saw the potential and passed the lube to the SEALs to test; “The results showed it has superior
lube and rust prevention characteristics but what really amazed us was it’s cleaning properties.” It simply destroys carbon, tarnish and even removes rust. A fellow Navy SEAL used it on his carbine rifle and made the comment; “Another FrogLube™ success story-mini-14 action was sticking a lot, but put on some FrogLube™ and it now cycles smoothly”. Another SEAL stated “FrogLube™ is the best product that I’ve used”. More good news; FrogLube™ is biodegradable, non-hazardous, non-toxic and non-flammable. Now, government officials, armorers and gun owners can act responsibly by eliminating exposure of their troops and employees to many known toxins in existing products on their shelves and in gun shops. Hazardous material
concerns are eliminated because there are no more soaked oily rags to dispose of, no more need to wear protective gear when cleaning guns, no more inhalation exposure to hazardous vapors in the air and no HAZMAT disposal required."

I would first like to say that I am no expert! So please view photos, ask questions and do your research.

I bought this rifle from a friend who's father past away. It was going to be part of an estate sale and he let me purchase prior. From the research I have done, according to the serial number it was made in 1886. I'm pretty sure at some point in it's life it has had some wood repair on it. But from what I can tell it's a matching rifle with all the correct markings.

I have the rifle on consignment at The Gun Vault in High Point North Carolina. You can go see it there if you wish. For purchasing, best person to talk to at the Gun Vault is Randy. There number is REDACTED. For trades or questions, please use the ""contact seller"" option.

I have for sale or trade my 1953 Hungarian Mosin Nagant M44 Carbine. It's not numbers matching, the buttplate, barrel, stock and magazine floor plate are but the bolt is not. No sling or cleaning rod that's how it came to me. Folding bayonet. The stock is real soft Arctic Birch so it's got some dings. Blue wear, probably at 60%. I know what it's worth and I don't want to touch anything on it. I'd rather buy a 91/30 from Fleet Farm for $100 to chop up. I'd like to trade even up for any of the guns listed below, no cash involved. I'm firm on the price of $150. I know most sell for $200. I'm really more in need of a home defense weapon and would like a pistol or shotgun for that. Cash only FTF no shipping . Sorry I don't have a better picture, my cell phone camera is crappy."

Needs some minor work, here and there.  We still use it to mow our 3 acres, just buying my dad's grasshopper this next spring and will have no use for it.  Thought maybe someone would have use for picking up leaves, it does a pretty good job as long as the leaves are dry.  At our old house we never had to rake, just mowed and picked up the leaves.

I put bigger tires on the front because my father-in-law had them and they were free, I still  have the front fenders and original tires.

I had the engine rebuilt about 5 or 6 years ago, went through it.  Replaced bearings, etc...  That needed it.

Featuring the TriNyte Corrosion Control System, the introduction of the Model 700 XCR in 2005 stretched the previous durability limits of stainless steel.

The stainless steel barrel and receiver are now coated with matte black TriNyte for a more classic look with less glare for superior stealth. It's every bit as impervious to extreme conditions, with the same proven track record in accelerated saltwater testing that opened the world's eyes to the power of our patented technology. Simply put, TriNyte delivers scratch and corrosion resistance dramatically superior to standard stainless steel as well any protective coating by any other manufacturer. The Model 700 XCR II is also optimized for sure handling in adverse climates. Its feature-laden olive drab greensynthetic stock is a technological marvel that looks and feels the part with patented Hogue rubber overmolding featured at the grip and fore-endareas. These revolutionary enhancements give you a positive grip in the slickest environments. And shots are made infinitely more comfortable withour SuperCell recoil pad - the most effective on the market today. X-Mark Pro Trigger System gives you a level of crispness and shot control once only available through high-dollar customization.

Have been carrying/shooting this pistol for years with 0 malfunctions. Ever. It is not ammo sensitive in the slightest.

Anyone who tells you Taurus pistols are crap is remembering the old days of poor manufacturing process and fit on their pistols. The PT1911 series is hammer forged and CNC machined for quality on par or in some parts superior to Kimber, Springfield and Colt. Don't listen to naysayers who have never shot one. I shoot them all, and will tell you this is a damn good 1911. I just have no need for a rail gun and would like a regular PT1911.

Genuine Civil War Relic!  (This is NOT a replica)

Serial Number 13327 (stamped into magazine and frame [under hammer])
Patent Date Jan 15, 1956 (stamped into the side of the frame)
Starr Arms Co, New York (stamped into the side of the frame)

I would describe the condition as good considering its vintage.  The company name, patent date, serial number and other markings can easily be read in various locations where they are stamped into the metal.  There is some pitting on the frame above the magazine cylinder from oxidation.  The outline of the inspectors mark can be seen faintly where it was stamped into the wood handle, but the inspectors initials are no longer visible.  The wooden handle has a some scratches and dents.

I researched the value of this item on the internet, and I have found that it typically retails for $1,500 or higher for this revolver in similar or better condition.  So I feel the price that I am asking represents a good deal.

Interested buyers can call/text telephone REDACTED.

Trivia - According to one website that I found while researching this item Clint Eastwood carried this sidearm in the movie “Unforgiven.”

Text found on reference #4:
“About 23,000 double-action Starr revolvers were manufactured in the late 1850s and early 1860s. Of these, most were purchased by the U.S. Army. Starr revolvers, in both single-and double-action models, represented over 12 percent of the sidearms issued to Union cavalry troops. Only Colt and Remington revolvers were more frequently encountered in the hands of Northern soldiers.

One of the earliest American double-action revolvers, this six-shot revolver has a six-inch round barrel rifled with six grooves. Over-all length is 11 5/8 inches, weight is two pounds 12 ounces, and the cylinder is 1 7/8 inches long. These revolvers have a steel blade front sight dovetailed into the barrel. A V-notch cut into the hammer lip serves as a rear sight. The Starr revolver is provided with a knurled screw on the right side of the frame which, when removed, allows the barrel to tip downwards on its hinged frame so that the cylinder can be removed.

Starr revolvers were invented by Eben Townsend Starr of New York City, grandson of Nathan Starr and son of Nathan Starr, Jr., famous U. S. swordmakers and riflemakers of Middletown, Connecticut. This model is marked on the right side of its frame ""STARR'S PATENT JAN. 15, 1856."", and on the left side, ""STARR. ARMS. Co. NEW YORK."" The patent date refers to E. T. Starr's U. S. Patent 14,118 for a self-cocking percussion pepperbox. His U.S. Patent 30,843, December 4, 1860, was for his double-action revolver.

Starr firearms were made at Yonkers, Binghamton, and Morrisania, New York, from 1858 to 1867. The New York City address referred to the Starr Arms Company store and office at 267 Broadway. Starr double-action .44 caliber revolvers, with serial numbers from 1 to about 23,000, were manufactured first, and Starr single-action .44 caliber revolvers, with serial numbers from about 23,000 to about 54,000, last.”"
