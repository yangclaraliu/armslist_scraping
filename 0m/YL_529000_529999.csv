It’s the one set up for a suppressor with the threaded barrel. It’s topped off with a BSA Sweet 22 6x18x40 with adjustable objective.  The scope has 3 bullet drop compensators in 36, 38 and 40 grain weights.  Say you’re shooting 36 grain bullets.  You sight the rifle in at 50 yards.  Then if you want to shoot at 100 yds you just crank the compensator up to 100 and you’re sighted in.  I put one of those Winchester bi-pods on the front.  There’s also 2 extra 10 round mags which I think are priced way beyond what they’re worth.  I don’t know how well you can see that target but that’s 5 shots @ 50 yds.  It would have been about a 1/3 inch group rather than a 1/2 but the old fool that was shooting got all excited when he saw the first four and pulled the last shot.  I want to sell/trade because I’m just not shooting it.  The range where I shoot has the rifle range about 75 yds from the pistol ranges so when I’m done shooting my pistols I have to put everything back in the car and drive down to the rifle range.

The LR-308, the first and foremost of the .308 line, and for which the rifle series is named, is a rifle to be reckoned with. So much so that it was named the NRA Rifle of the year in 2005.
With a 24” stainless bull barrel, 1 in 10 twist and free floating handguard and a flat top receiver for easier mounting of optics, the LR-308 has gone toe to toe with bolt action rifles and delivered comparable accuracy, with higher magazine capacity and rate of fire. The conventional thought that ""only a bolt action could be considered a precision rifle"" has been in contention ever since. 
This rifle features several factory installed modifications including replacing the slick side high rise upper receiver with an A3 upper receiver with forward assist, shell deflector and dust cover. Installing a JP adjustable trigger in place of the standard trigger, changing the A2 grips for panther tactical grips, replacing the vented free float tube for the standard free float tube and swapping a black coated flutes bull barrel for the standard bull barrel.

I have a Tanfoglio Witness .45 auto for trade. Double/Single action, 10 round magazine capacity. This gun is incredibly accurate and has impressive ergonomics. Made by Tanfoglio in Italy and imported by EAA, these guns are used in match competition as an alternative to the single action 1911. This one has the proprietary anti-corrosive Wonder finish. According to the proof marks, this gun was made in 1999 and the serial number range falls outside the factory firing pin recall that applied to certain guns which had to be sent in for an upgrade. Aside from the soft rubber factory grips and the magazine floor plate, there isn't a piece of plastic on this gun-- it is built like a tank and is a breeze to field strip. It also has the desirable stronger, older style square-sided slide (Newer round slides and some square sided guns had issues with slides cracking, though primarily in 10mm and .40 chamberings). This is one of the harder to find older, problem-free guns before quality control issues started to crop up with newer ones on some online forums.

The gun has a very low round count and is like new in the original box with the manual and a blank warranty registration card (limited life-time factory warranty). It will include an Uncle Mike's holster with magazine pouch, a spare factory magazine and a trigger lock. It belonged to my late grandfather who didn't shoot it much and kept it in excellent condition.

I am interested in trading for a different pistol, preferably also in .45 ACP. I have found that I prefer the 1911 platform. Trade value is $550. I am open to a variety of different trades at this point, but a 1911 would be nice (Rock Island Armory, Remington R1 1911, Springfield Armory Mil-Spec). I'd really like an officer's model sized sub compact (Kimber pro-carry Ultra II, Colt MK IV or maybe an HK .45 USP Tactical, in which case I have a Beretta M92FS Inox, a Savage-Stevens 311 H series SxS double barreled shotgun that is hammer less with dual triggers, or a .50 Cal Spanish made Kentucky cap and ball pistol I could throw in to compensate for the difference in value."

The LR-308, the first and foremost of the .308 line, and for which the rifle series is named, is a rifle to be reckoned with. So much so that it was named the NRA Rifle of the year in 2005.
With a 24” stainless bull barrel, 1 in 10 twist and free floating handguard and a flat top receiver for easier mounting of optics, the LR-308 has gone toe to toe with bolt action rifles and delivered comparable accuracy, with higher magazine capacity and rate of fire. The conventional thought that ""only a bolt action could be considered a precision rifle"" has been in contention ever since. 
This rifle features several factory installed modifications including replacing the slick side high rise upper receiver with an A3 upper receiver with forward assist, shell deflector and dust cover. Installing a JP adjustable trigger in place of the standard trigger, replacing the vented free float tube for the standard free float tube and swapping a black coated flutes bull barrel for the standard bull barrel.

The Nagant M1895 Revolver is a seven-shot, gas-seal revolver designed and produced by Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant for the Russian Empire. The Nagant M1895 was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, 7.62x38R, and featured an unusual ""gas-seal"" system, in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile and allowing the weapon to be suppressed (an unusual ability for a revolver).Its for sale or trade -It has been shot 1 cylinder full -I have two boxs of ammo less 7 shells that go with it -Not a badd price for a revolver and 80 dollars worth of ammo -all for 200 bucks -It is for sale as long as this post is running-I will take it off once it sales"

WWW.PCShooting.com

We have 8 spots left in our upcoming North Carolina CCH / CCW Concealed Pistol Training class this Sunday.

The course is instructed by seasoned firearms instructor, Roger Pettit.
Roger is fully licensed and fully insured (Lloyd's of London) and we hold the class on an actual gun range. He has a great sense of humor and has great stories being he's an ex-marine, bounty hunter, and has worked with multiple military contractors. The cost of the class is $85 a person OR $150 ($75 each) if you bring along a friend. This price is ALL INCLUSIVE meaning this price includes course work, red book, certificate, drinks and pizza for lunch, and Roger even supplies guns and ammo if you choose not to bring your own!!! No tricks or gimmicks here! If you don't have experience, no worries! Roger will get you up to pace during the class. If you've done any research on CCH you know $85 is CHEAP and alternatives NEVER include this much. The classes are small (10-20) and Roger has years of experience teaching them in multiple states. If interested let me know and check out the website info: www.PCShooting.com.

The next class is August 26th. Location is 20 minutes outside Cary, NC down US-1 at LCWC.

Email if interested as seats are limited. Email can be found on our listed website.

BE PREPARED for any possible madness come the end of this year!

The original owner of this firearm is a close friend of mine and I acquired it in settlement of some money that he owed me.  I basically have 900 invested in this firearm.  I do not need to make a profit, I just want my original $900 back and will sell this firearm well below cost.  Now I know that this technically is not a new gun since it is owned privately, however upon inspection you will find that it is absolutely flawless, not a single scratch on it.  It has never been fired nor has a round even been loaded in it.  It comes with everything pictured:  firearm, 2 magazines, box, paperwork, lock, grip inserts, etc.  You will not find a brand new one in better condition than this.  I have sold many firearms on  here before and can even give references to previous buyers that well tell you that everything I post is as described.  You can even disassemble the gun upon inspection to validate everything I have claimed on this pistol.  

I have also attached a picture of the current blue book value of this firearm, showing it's MSRP, 100% and lower values depending on condition.  In it's current condition, used value is at $1025 per the current Blue Book Of Gun Values.

I'll even throw in a box of Ultramax ammo at $25 per box if you need any ammo!

Please call me at 405 six2six 18one4   (sorry but I have to do it this way) if you have any questions or would like to see this firearm.  Hurry because I would be amazed if it lasts very long at this price.

Came off a Saiga 7.62X39 that was converted but should work on other Saiga rifles and AKs provided they are stamped receivers. Check with Tapco's website first if you are not sure. Works great, no problems. The Tapco collapsible stock w/ pistol grip was designed for a stock Saiga, however the pistol grip can be removed so the stock can be used with an AK or converted Saiga. This stock was also custom fitted with a spring loaded hidden compartment to keep the cleaning kit as supplied with a Saiga rifle. The retaining tab swings either direction to free the cleaning kit, but only when the buttstock is removed from the stock adapter tube. So it remains captive by the buttstock for security and there is a fitted spring in the tube to help the cleaning kit pop out when you release the retaining tab. In the process of coming up with this design there was a small screw hole made in the side of the tube for a set screw to be placed, but came up with the design mentioned above. This hole does not effect anything and it only becomes a cosmetic issue when you remove the buttstock, you otherwise cannot see it. See pictures below for more details.

It also shoots the hulking 7.62x54 round, so it doesn't play. Also it comes with 2 mags, a russian sniper scope, which are getting harder to find, and a 50 cal ammo can full of 7.62x54.

Came off a Saiga 7.62X39 that was converted but should work on other Saiga rifles and AKs provided they are stamped receivers. Check with Tapco's website first if you are not sure. Works great, no problems. The Tapco folding stock is a true AK-47 stock but can also be used on a Saiga whether it is converted or not. The only thing I should mention with the folding stock is that the previous owner I bought this from, for whatever reason, got a drill bit stuck in it. It in no way effects anything, you can still get 2 screws in up top without a problem and the drill bit does not protrude."

I don't know everything about it but this is what I know. 
 Ackley Improved chambers blow out the shoulder of the case to decrease body taper and increase shoulder angle, resulting in a higher case capacity. This will make a .30-06 shoot like a .300 Win. Mag. It is built on a Mauser Action which has had the ""cock on open"" conversion done and the rear sight milled off and tapped for a 1 piece base. It is fitted with a Military Barrel that was brand new for a .30 cal machine gun on an army tank. It started at 30"" but has been cut down to 22"" and reblued. I'm not sure what trigger was used but it feels light and crisp. It has a Leupold M8 6X which is a fixed 6 power. The stock has been bedded and is a nice piece of wood but does have some dings from over the years. 
 This gun has only had a couple of boxes of shells through it since it was built. It is a 1/2 MOA gun with good 168 gr. ammo. My dad's knees were bad and he never really got to hunt with it. He didn't even blow out enough cases to ever reload for it.

All and all this is a great rifle at a great price just in time for hunting season! $500 or best offer or $400 without the Leupold Scope."

This all original Colt comes with a grouping of 9 used magazines (two 30-rounders, seven 20-rounds) of various makes. Also included is a German made Colt marked bayonet and scabbard. THe bayonet has been sharpened to a keen edge. Additionally, there is a pistol belt, magazine pouch for 4 20-rounders, extra bayo scabbard, cleaning kit and an E&L snap-on brass catcher.

This handgun began as a joint-venture between Colt and CZ, with Colt's one requirement being that the finished product must retain outward similarity to the 1911. However, any similarity between the 1911 and 40B end with the externals. In actually, the internal workings of the 40B are adapted from the CZ 75 line of pistols. The CZ 40B sports a lightweight alloy frame with an all steel slide. As opposed to the 1911 and most other western firearms, the 40B's slide rides inside the frame which helps to increase both reliability and accuracy. The standard magazines hold 10+1 rounds of .40 S&W in a double column design, although higher capacity aftermarket magazines for other CZ pistols are reported to function in the 40B. The pistol is finished with a black polymer coat which is supposed to be more durable than standard bluing during normal service usage.

I ordered 2 boxes of 9mm ammo from Palmetto State Armory (9.99/box) and immediately responded and informed them that I would pick up and do not ship.  I have done this process many times per their instructions.  Well 2 days later, I get an response stating the order has been shipped.  I have called 3 times and spoke to 3 different PSA employees and they all stated that my process was correct but there was nothing that they could do at this point.  All I asked was to give me $6 credit towards my next order.  My deal just cost me close to full retail when you add $6 shipping to a $20 order.

This is a beautiful firearm.  Gun has been sporterized some. Stock has been cut down from original length to carbine length. Barrel looks like it was blued at one time years ago. Some pitting but not very much. Gun is shootable (verified by Village Arms in Gap PA.
What I know about it:
Issued in 1889. Has a very crisp cartouche in the stock bearing master armor initials and 1889. Research say it was issued to a volunteer militia (unknown what state).
Inside barrel has very little corrosion and can be fired using modern cowboy ammo no problem. Trapdoor is dated 1884. Will score a “good” on the NRA condition scale.
These sell unsporterized for $600-$1000, I’m asking $450. Will come with a padded transport sleeve."

Six great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit


1. ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK OEM sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3. INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4. FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.

6. ONE YEAR FACTORY DIRECT WARRANTY
Warranty covers any defects in materials or workmanship."

Why sir did you feel the need in the first place to place your order online for your 9.99$ a box 9mm ammo, when your intention the whole time was to go to the store and get it.  Why would you cause everyone more confusion than necessary.  They would have sold it to you there for the same 9.99$ a box.  I have dealt with PSA since day one.  And before they had a store front I also used to buy online and pick up at their warehouse.  But they have a storefront now.  These people ship out thousands of orders a day, and beat everyones prices around.  Yet you are still complaining about 6 dollars.  Please sir from here on out feel free to shop elsewhere.

Their ammo isn't the best price either and most of it is 5 and 6 years old that warehouses had to off load to a schmuck. shop around and you will see. Palmetto state armory buys there items from midway USA and brownells. They also pay $25 for the lower and upper receivers as they get the slag of receivers. Not the cream of the crop. PSA employees are dicks too. they will bull shit with their buddies while you stand there waiting to spend money but cant get help.  go kiss PSA ass all you want but they suck. I hope they go out of business because there are better places in SC and much better people. By the way their gunsmith sucks ass. He cant even pin a FSB on straight or ream a barrel properly. God help you if you buy something they assembled as it will be trash.By the way, i'm sleeping with one of the guys wife that works there. and at the time of that guy ordered they were not matching the deal of the day in store. communications is horrible at PSA and the girls they have there answering the phone dont know shit. call and ask one if they have a stripped upper and how much. They will say $400-$500....thinking you want a rifle. call and ask if they have a certain weapon in stock, they dont even know what kind of gun a AR15 is or a springfield 1911. The girls are for eye candy only and are about as stupid as a door knob. get some real people in there that know what customer service is and someone that can answer a question. I have placed several orders in the past and not one ever got shipped correctly. Thank God I wised up and shop with brownels and lawmen now. midwayusa and brownells and bulkammo and able ammo plus surplus ammo beats them hands down and dont take three weeks to ship. I can order teh same lower PSa sales from surplus ammo for $59- it is made by the same exact people. so take your ass kissing some where else. PS: we know you work there or how else would you know he ordered 9mm ammo? all the other person posted was two boxes and $20. nice try idiot.

PSS: Im serious about sleeping with one of the employee's wife."
