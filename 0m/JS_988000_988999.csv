No matter what your mission, the size and weight of your equipment is a critical factor. With the Aimpoint Micro H-1, Aimpoint has introduced an aiming system that provides the performance of full-sized sights in the smallest package possible. Designed with the hunter in mind, these sights are the lightest red dot sights tough enough to bear the Aimpoint name. Small enough to be used anywhere that you could put iron sights, these sights can be used on any type of firearm or archery equipment. A lightweight rifle with Micro H-1 mounted on it remains a lightweight rifle. A hunting revolver with a Micro H-1 installed remains as easy to carry as with iron sights and is much quicker to aim. On a bow, the parallax-free Micro H-1 eliminates the need for a peep, allowing you to shoot accurately in lower light. 
Built to offer the same battle-proven ruggedness as other Aimpoint products, the Micro H-1 is able to perform under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon. Suitable for use on rifles, carbines, shotguns, and handguns, the Aimpoint Micro H-1 is ideal as a stand-alone sight, and because it weighs less than 4 ounces including the integrated Weaver mount, it can easily be “piggybacked” on top of larger magnifying scopes optics.
Aimpoint's unique band-pass coating on the front lens gives the highest possible dot brightness, while providing the clearest, brightest image possible.
Features 13 brightness settings for use in daylight and low-light conditions, so the Micro H-1 is ready for use around the clock. 

Unique Features of the Micro H-1:

- Ideal for rifles, carbines, shotguns, and handguns
- 1x (non-magnifying) parallax-free optic
- Integral Weaver-style mount allows easy attachment to any rail 
- Patent pending mount is keyed to the sight body to absorb recoil
- New ACET technology allows 50,000 hours (over 5 years) of constant operation from one battery
- 4 MOA dot
- 13 brightness settings for use in daylight and low-light conditions
- Matte Black finish
- Submersible to 15 feet (5 meters)
- Precision adjustments for windage and elevation. Top of protective caps fits into holes on adjustment screws – no other tool required
- Use as a stand alone sight or “piggybacked” on larger magnifying optics

You can't get a better scope than this.  Brand new, in the case, accessories, cover, case, all paperwork.  Never even mounted on my AR.  This is brand new.  Price is $1,100 cash.  Price is firm.  This is an amazing scope and I know for a fact you can't find this scope New anywhere else for this price.
Trijicon TA31A ACOG 4x32 Scope with Red Dual Illumination Triangle Reticle BAC features Dual Illumination (Fiber Optic provides daylight illumination and imagetritium illuminates reticle at night). The reticle of the Trijicon Rifle Scope ranges out to 800 Meters for 5.56 (.223 cal). Trijicon 4 x 32mm ACOG Advanced Combat Optical Gunsights TA31A hit fast in any light. Trijicon ACOG 4 x 32 Riflescopes TA-31A are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using fiber optics which collect ambient light. Trijicon 4x32 ACOGs combine traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. Although Trijicon ACOG 4 x 32 Rifle Scopes TA31-A have many features which are very advantageous for military use, they were developed by Trijicon without government funding. Designed for use with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions - without failure-prone batteries."

The 3XMag magnifying module is specially designed for compatibility with Aimpoint sights and for maximum flexibility and increased performance in the field. The 3XMag is a revolutionary tool for military personnel, law enforcement, sport shooters and hunters. When combined with Aimpoint's patented TwistMount, the 3XMag gives the user something never before possible – the ability to switch in a split second from CQB (Close Quarters Battle) to semi-sniping and vice versa. Hunters can rapidly switch from non-magnifying to magnifying while still being able to keep their Aimpoint sight on their firearm. The versatile 3XMag also can be used as a handheld magnifying glass monocular for discrete observation and identification.


The recommended mount for the 3XMag is the Aimpoint Twist Mount, which allows for quick attachment and detachmen. The Aimpoint TwistMount fits any MIL-Std 1913 Picatinny Rail.

System: Magnifying Module

Magnification: 3X
Eye relief : at 5° FOV 40 – 90 mm at full FOV 60 – 65 mm

Unique features

Mountable on a rail system behind Aimpoint sights
Extremely fast and ingenious mounting solution (Twist Mount - Picatinny)
Can also be mounted with a regular 30 mm ring
Provides extended range to the operator

Increases confidence, performance and flexibility
No influence on point of impact –– No need for re-zeroing the sight

REDACTED After 7PM.

This is the original Colt 16"" ""carbine type"" Semi Automatic modeled after the ""Fully Automatic Military CAR-!5"" which for some unknown reason the ATF classifies as a ""Sub Machine Gun"" while the full size 20"" barrel M-16 is a ""Machine Gun"" although they fire the same ammo!? Go figure.

This is the Pre-Ban ""CAR-15"" semi auto version real Original Colt. 1 in 9"" barrel twist stabilizes both 55 and 62 grain bullets. ""CAR-15"" type Flash Suppressor threaded 3/4 way forward and sildes over the barrel to make the 16"" barrel look shorter like the Military CAR-15 so it is legal to own. (Military CAR-15 Full Autos have 12"" barrels and are illegal to own without a Fed Tax Stamp and $200.00 transfer tax.) 

Original ""Birdcage"" type included if you wish to change it back to a smaller supressor. (Not shown.) Collapsible stock, 32"" collapsed (Shown.) 35.5"" extended. 

Special edition ""Z- Coat"" self lubricating black polymer finish, bayonet lug, 1 20 round factory Colt mag, factory Colt sling. Accepts all AR-15 type mags. Excellent to like new condition, minor handling/storage marks, hardly noticeable, must see!

Purchased new by me for collector purposes, it is the only one I have ever seen like it, it has been in my vault since. Test fired out of the box less than 200 rounds by me for accuracy and reliability purposes with no malfunctions. cleaned and put back in vault.

Very nice weapon. Completely legal to own. Requires valid pistol permit or NC Concealed Handgun Permit and NCDL. 

Cash only or Equilivant in US Gold Or Silver Eagles. Gold or Silver preferred method of payment. You will have a signed, serial numbered receipt for the weapon as well as the original owner's manual and ""Bird Cage"" type flash suppressor. (Not Shown.) 

Very light and easy to conceal due to size but accurate out past 500 yards.

$2000.00 is the asking price firm, well worth it in today's about to ban market. The ""Z-Coat"" process alone is $300.00."

Its missing 3 of the original screws, 2 of them keep the stock attached to the receiver. The other screw thats missing keeps the magazine tube attached to the barrel, there is a makeshift screw in its place. Its also missing the original shell chaser. Its missing the original buttplate. This shotgun is in firing condition, ive seen it fired with no problem. Ive actually found these parts online for cheap and it would run approx. $250-$300 to get the gun into a beautiful restored condition. At that point it'll easily fetch $1,300 to $1600.

Buyer is responsible for researching and knowing the applicable state and local laws prior to purchasing, possessing, transporting or using a TASER I have two 25ft cartridges that I will include, which are normally only 15ft. I also have a black carrying case that will come with the taser as well. If your a guy, girl, young, or older, looking for a personal non-lethal self defense weapon then this is for you!! If your looking for some type of saftey for your girl friend, or spouse, & they are not willing to carry a firearm, then this is your alternative. This is the civilian version, and is capable of releasing a consistent 30 second charge at once, while you get to safety. You also have the option of pulling the trigger once for a 10 second release. It has never given me any problems. 
I'm asking 850.00 obo for the taser, and includes (2)-25ft cartridges, and black case."

The Knight Mountaineer has a 27” fluted Green Mountain barrel for extreme accuracy. Each barrel has been hand treated with a ceramic-based bore coating that increases velocity and reduces the need to swab between shots. Every bolt and bolt handle on a Mountaineer is individually machined, not cast, and then finished with detailed jeweling and intricate knurling, providing a touch of class to an ignition system that is easy to use and clean.

Thinking about selling my 410 Saiga.
It has been fully converted to an American made AK trigger group. Not just the crappy looking bolt on pistol grip that uses the Saiga trigger group...
Gun has a SAW style pistol grip and a side folding stock. Fully r922 compliant.
The gun comes with a 4 rd magazine and a hi cap 15 rd magazine.
The gun runs amazing!
Cycles buckshot, slugs, sabot slugs, bird shot. What ever you want.
Don't let people tell you smack about 410s. They are awesome. 000 buck at the same speed as a 12, but with absolutely no recoil.

Considering parting with my beloved GSG5.
It's the most desirable model.
The SD pre lawsuit.
The SD model features the bigger diameter fake suppressor that actually looks good.
On top of that it's pre-lawsuit (KH didn't like GSG building a gun that looks EXACTLY like their MP5), meaning it is of sheet metal construction, just like the original. Unlike the new ones that are all plastic... It also has the correct MP5 sights, charge handle, pistol grip and trigger guard.
The picatinny rail on top is removable and made of steel as well.

Gun comes with:
- SD version hand guard
- Tri Rail hand guard
- Vertical grip (original GSG)
- Picatinny scope rail
- Fixed stock
- Collapsible stock (slides into the upper, making the gun VERY compact, also original GSG)
- 2 magazines
- Magazine clamp
- Various little parts and the original GSG tools and paperwork
- Original box

If interested, I also have a 110 rd drum mag, a red dot with see through rings and ammo for sale if anyone is interested.

500$ or maybe a nice trade (have CPL) will make it yours.
I think this is a VERY fair price for this sweet gun.
I've seen people asking 1000$ for these at gun shows and they were the crappy plastic guns...

Gun is in immaculate condition and runs like a champ.

22 lr is sold out just about everywhere, so I could sell you some if need be.

Up for your consideration - my dear deer gun.
A beautiful H&R slug gun with wood furniture.
It has the tiger stripe receiver.
Barrel is the heavy rifled version.
This thing is a tach driver! And a 20 ga sabot slug packs enough of a punch for everything MI has to offer.
Gun comes with:

- Heavy rifled barrel
- 3-9 power scope
- Quick open flip up dust caps
- Bird barrel
- Leather sling
- Wood stock
- 2 wood hand guards
- 5 shot sleeve for the stock

I also have ammo for sale if interested.
No cheapo stuff. Hornady sabots etc.

350 is a very fair price for this beauty.
Also would consider the right trade (have CPL).

FTF only.

Thanks for checking out my add.
Tom"

This one is a flattop rifle, full sized quad rails, Free floating 16"" heavy barrel with 1-8 twist, breacher muzzle, Magpul hardware. I've only added a few things to it, a BSA red dot, Promag flattop riser, and a sinlge point sling adapter. I prefer iron sights and only went with the BSA for night home defense. Mags and ammo including

Now for the first time last week I had taken this AR shooting with some buddies who also own assault rifles. We all agreed that my AR was the best there out of an AK, SKS, and a Bushmaster. I use a Colt in the military and  I like it better than the Colt."
