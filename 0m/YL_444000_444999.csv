It has a 20” round barrel, chambered in .38-55 with a full length magazine tube, walnut stocks, Crescent butt with a steel butt plate & the receiver is case colored. The barrel is stamped Special Smokeless Steel & the last patent date is August 1, 1893. The top of the receiver says Marlin Safety & the upper tang is marked Marlin Model 1893 with the “old style” writing containing John Marlins initials. The rear sight is a folding adjustable Marbles, the front sight is unmarked. The barrel retains almost all of its original bluing, all stampings are clear & legible, there are a couple of small pits & some minor handling marks. Some “pipe wrench” marks exist near the receiver & an extra dovetail in the bottom just forward of the fore end cap. The mag tube has turned Patina, the receiver & lever still show traces of case color in the right light. A little pin head pitting is seen on the receiver upon up-close inspection. The stocks have nice grain & still have traces of varnish. The wood fits proud to the metal & does not look to have ever been sanded. The forearm is in great shape but the butt stock has had some wood screws added to repair a crack. The repair is very old & there is no movement. Mechanically sound; loads, cycles, fires & ejects with no issues. The bore is INCREDIBLE; mirror bright, shiny & flawless! The holes in the upper tang are factory drilled & tapped for a tang sight, the plug screws are absent. Known issues: it does not hold ‘half cock”, I am not sure if is supposed to. My research indicates that the “smokeless” barrel stamping did not start until 1895 & the forearm appears to be for an octagon barrel. This plus the pipe wrench marks & extra dovetail suggests that the barrel has been change somewhere along the line. All in all, this is a great looking Marlin 1893 Rifle that is 118 years old & still in working condition with an excellent bore. Best of all it is in .38-55!"

I posted an ad for this a couple of weeks ago, but almost immediately was hospitalized and unable to respond to most inquiries.   I will try to answer most questions:

Yes, I am interested in trades, however, my interests right now are in replacing my WWII guns.  So I am interested in a M1 Carbine, M1 Garand or a Colt .45.   I am also interested in a Ruger Model 77V or Remington 700 .223, Ruger 10-22, or a Llama .380 or something similar.   Yes, I have other firearms I would be willing to sell or trade including a Marlin 782 22wmr, Remingtion 700 30-06. 

First, for those wanting pictures, I am posting two pics; both fully assembled and field stripped.  Second, no I will not sell it without going through a dealer.  Third, it is in really nice condition, no rust, etc..  however, you will not confuse for being brand new.  It is old and has some minor evidence of being older.  No I will not mail it.  I hope this answers everyone's questions."

Add a bit of mountain style to your casual look with the Perch Hill boot from Mountrek. The ruggedly handsome upper has a relaxed quality with simple seams and subtle detail stitching. A warm fabric lining gives you a soft, comfortable fit while the traction rubber outsole can take a little adventure.
Casual yet rugged enough for a little fun and play. The SportShift™ collection was designed to transition easily from sports to casual comfort. Durable nubuck upper. Classic lace up design. Cross stitch details. Padded collar. Logo detail on back. Five layer footbed absorbs shock and returns energy. Footbed is equipped with anti-moisture fabric, dual-density foam and EVA comfort system. Molded EVA midsole provides lightweight stability, flexibility and comfort. Rubber pads at strike points provide anti-slip added traction. All-rubber, non-marking, skid-resistant outsole.

The original tags may not be attached. For example, new shoes (with absolutely no signs of wear) that are no longer in their original box fall into this category."

I saw one sitting at a shop after work and i figured id pick up another but it sat in the box for a few. Id like to trade it for a complete lower (ar), but I'm open to trade suggestions and will accept money as well. This should be a given but no felons or anyone who can jeopardize my right to bear arms. I wont loose what i enjoy most which is sport shooting so if its illegal sorry bud but i refuse to give you a gun. Not trying to turn anyone off but Ive had numerous flakers and i recognize the potential to misuse private transfer and its people like that who make it harder for us all to do what we enjoy. Im a nice guy, I just want to get rid 
of this rifle without complications so message me im open to trades. Id prefer a good lower above anything else, but ill take something along the lines of  ammo or parts for my black rifles. a decent bolt action would be great as well. but like i said, i have two of these and it doesn't seem like mine will ever stop functioning correctly so Im open to equal value trades.

Update: I fired a box of Federal white 115g at Ye Olde last week. Zero failures like i expected from my other. the round count is only 50 though which is a small amount to judge by, but I know this rifle and its gonna just keep doing the same thing. My other has WAY more rounds fired and i've never had any failures even with hp projectiles and surplus steel cases. It also likes golden saber and buffalo bore so i can say without a doubt from personal experience that it takes ANY bullet if ammo choice is a factor for you. Its a great gun im very glad I purchased them, but i only need one so 
come and get it before firearm prices increase even more this year with the upcoming elections.

Unique Technical Features
The outer tubes & internal components are extremely robust.
The adjustment system is:
- repeatable
- steel on steel
- with audible clicks
Double internal spring force. Every Burris scope has it.



Posi-Lock
• Posi-Lock is a coil-spring assisted retractable steel post that firmly and & securely locks accuracy into place. 
• Once the reticle is zeroed, the covering tube (red) replaces the internal spring (green) & locks the inner tube in place. 
• All scopes have one spring that allows the adjustment of the reticle. 
Some of the competition competitors offer a double spring whereas the double spring is the STANDARD for all Burris products. 
• As an optional, it’s possible to have the special Posi-Lock system. 
Posi-Lock scopes remain perfectly zeroed year after year even during transportation.

In the closed position, the force of the spring is substituted by the force of the steel post on the internal tube of the scope.



On all rifle scopes:
• Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope
• Every scope is individually recoil, water and fogproof tested 
• Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage



Recoil Test
Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests
An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration.
This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.

Waterproof Test
All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof.
Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C.
The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. 


Fog Test
The nitrogen contained in the scope is:
• of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen)
• ultra pure
• ultra clean
To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of 
• pressurizing the scope
• subjecting it to a vacuum
The tests are both cost & time intensive


I do not have the packaging for either item.

Awesome gun, shoots like a dream. Not a signal mark on it.  I have bought a couple new guns and need to lighten my safe of guns I do not shoot much.  I have 160 rounds down the barrel; all hand loads.  Shot 1.5 group at 300yrds 3 weeks ago with my hands loads.
  Glass does not come with the gun, will make a deal if you want it though.  Also if you reload I will through in the dies and 90 165gn HTBT Serria bullets in with it. Pictures speak for itself.
  If you want a hard hitting, ass kicking, a gun you do not see every day- this is for you.  If you do not want a powerful gun, go look at a 30-06 or 308.

It features a technopolymer reinforced fiberglass frame, advanced ergonomics, and a modular concept that allows you to modify the pistol to suit your needs and modes of operation. The model JXF9F21 comes with two 17-round magazines.
Model: JXF9F21
Caliber: 9 mm
Frame: full size
Overall length: 7.6""
Overall height: 5.5""
Barrel length: 4.0""
Sight Radius: 5.8""
Overall width: 1.4""
Weight (unloaded): 27.7 ounces
Magazine capacity: 17 rounds
Beretta PX4 Storm Features:
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.
9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling."

My name is Justin Langager. Recently I underwent a background investigation for employment at Boeing. Upon review of my investigation it was brought to my attention that there is an outstanding warrant (01/08/07), due to a charge that I had before I joined the United States Marine Corps. I was charged with minor intoxication and sentenced to 2 days jail, 2 years supervised probation, 2 year notify court of address change, 2 years no criminal violations, 2 years no alcohol/drug related violations,2 years no alcohol/drugs, 60 days alcohol treatment and $500.00 fine. I stayed overnight in jail to be seen by the judge, paid all fines in full and I have not had any other violations of any kind since this occasion (military or civilian).

I had worked with my recruiter, Staff Sergeant Allen, to utilize my commitment to our country as serving the remainder of my sentence. SSgt. Allen made multiple trips to the court house on my behalf to insure my eligibility for enlistment in the Marines. This misdemeanour was taken care of to the standards of the military also; I was able to get a secret security clearance from the Department of Defence. I was under the impression that this was stricken from my record completely, until 07/19/10 (shortly after my second tour in Afghanistan) a warrant was issued for my arrest but was not received by me.

My intention for this letter is to have this issue addresses, so that I can finish my pre- employment screening at Boeing and provide for my wife and one year old son. Before the Marines I was liable to make mistakes of this magnitude; however, as an honourably separated Marine, husband and father. I have no intention on having any another negative interaction with the law of any kind.

my interaction with lynnwood municipal court has been nothing but professional and respectful, however I have not revived the same courtesy. I understand that this issue is not the first priority of the city or the public defenders office however, it is mine. an obvious mistake like this shouldn’t have any issue being quashed as you can not join the military with outstanding legal issues.I have already contacted the 1St congressional district about this issue. also I have spent more than the time charge in dry country serving our country, far more than what was rewired by the court. this is not the the treatment of a veteran. that the city of lynnwood would like to be know for.

thank you for your time,
Sgt.. Langager, Justin B."

I don’t need to sell, just thining the herd a bit.

Up for grabs: Norinco 56s under folding AK47. These haven’t been imported in more than 20 years and are very scarce. This one appears to be unfired and is super clean. Comes with (2) 30rd mags, slant brake and factory AR style brake, strap and drag bag. If you are looking for a great investment this is the one for you! I am firm at $1500 cash however I prefer trades (see below). 

This is a private sale. FTF in the greater Tampa Bay area, I require FL DL and/or CWP. No felons/crazies or anyone else that can not own a firearm lawfully. I will ship from my FFL to buyer’s FFL anywhere in the lower 48 states for $40.00. Thanks for looking and have a great day!"
