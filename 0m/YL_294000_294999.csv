These rare 1st production automatics are prized. These appreciate in value especially the Bedlams Auto's 1st production numbered under fifty. I paid $799.00 at a knife show from a retired Benchmade employee. The Bedlam 860 Knife initially was only made in automatic which was Awesome but! Some states consider large automatics knives illegal without a military or police exception only if carried. Benchmade noticed this, and soon came up with a lesser expensive non-automatic smaller bedlam called ""The Non-Auto 8600 bedlam"". The Original Benchmade 860 Bedlam Automatic design was originally designed for the Prince of Jordan’s royal guard. This is the same knife I have making it rare. Benchmade won't ever again make AXS 1st production Bedlam's Automatic like this again. Unfortunately my plans were to keep it and pass it down later in life but I am forced to sell it.

Bore & rifling is the best I've seen on a rifle this old.
It does have some blue missing but much of it is retained. It does have a couple areas of surface rust and some minor pitting but still in very good condition for it's age.
Wood looks to have been touched up or partially refinished at some point in it's life but other than the normal dings the wood is still in excellent shape.

I am pricing this according to the secondary market for this model and caliber and within the current guidelines of the blue book value of guns based on it's condition. I am open to offers but I urge you to research the gun and it's value for yourself before making an offer.

This has the newest “V” SERIES technology which allows the operator to switch on the fly between White visible light and Infrared light.  The spots in the pictures are lint - this weapons light is practically brand new.  This is probably the one of, if not, THE BEST weapons light Surefire has available.

Taking a pretty big hit on this but I'll let it go for $500 (was $550) USPS money order (Paid $800).  Will consider paypal with 4% fees.  Shipping included in price and will be tracked and insured via USPS priority.

Description
M720V
The variable-output M720V RAID WeaponLight produces brilliant 150-lumen white light or 240 milliwatts of infrared output for use with night vision devices—with no need for IR filters or spare lamps. Simply push and twist the self-locking selector ring on the dual-spectrum V-series head to switch between white light or IR illumination—or select the ""disable"" setting to prevent accidental discharges. In either spectrum mode, the M720V's TIR lens produces a tight beam suited for close- to medium-range applications with sufficient peripheral illumination for situational awareness. The highly efficient LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break. It comes with a pressure-activated SR07-M720V tape switch (with a 7"" cable) that can be positioned where you choose. If your remote switch becomes damaged or disconnected, rotate your RAID WeaponLight's white-light selector switch to "";flashlight"" mode and activate it directly via its integral pushbutton dome switch. (This same pushbutton switch provides low navigational white light when ""flashlight"" mode is not selected.) This selector switch also lets you choose three different white-light output settings: high, medium, or strobe. The IR selector switch, located on opposite side, offers high-, medium-, and low-output settings when IR mode is selected on head. The M720V attaches solidly to your Picatinny rail via our Swing-Lever™ clamp, which self-adjusts to out-of-spec rails and features a lever lock to prevent loosening from recoil or impact. Built to withstand the rigors of combat, the M720V is constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance and optically coated tempered glass for durability and maximum light transmission. It's also O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture. Available in black or desert sand.

Fits: Rifles, carbines, or submachine guns with a Picatinny rail on the forend. (See our Picatinny Rail Forends). [NSN: 6230-01-590-2412, 6230-01-592-9028]

The G2M has a slightly larger scabbard, to better accommodate weapons with larger cross-sections or bulky optics.  The scabbard is wide at the bottom, giving the option of carrying weapons butt-down or butt-up.  The main bag is the same size as the GS05M, so capacity is about the same (2900 ci).  Like the Operator, it features both front loading and top loading features, giving exceptional flexibility.

The scabbard on the G2 folds into the bottom of the pack and is secured by a buckle.  This configuration is good for shorter weapons and other gear; it's also a great place to carry a laptop computer.

Heavy duty compression straps always cause the pack to ride quiet and tight; it can be compressed completely flat.  They can be routed through the scabbard compression loops, which allows you to selectively compress the scabbard.

The top pocket assembly features a handy internal organizer, with several small pockets, pen holders, and a padded pocket which serves equally well for AR mags or for a PDA, cell phone, and similar items.

Hydration sleeves on the back wall, semi-transparent tuck pockets, and Padlock (PALS) webbing fit out the interior.

The pack includes the GSTC Butt Cover, with pull-out sleeve.  This allows you to fully enclose a rifle up to 60"" long."

It just turned 38,000 miles and has been garage kept since bought new. It is Yellow and has a 3"" Sky Jacker lift kit. It has never been taken off road. The 4 wheel drive has only been used during the winter, on a few occasions. I have changed the oil every 3,000 miles or every 6 months as sometimes I did not put 3,000 miles on it in a 6 month period. I have always ran premium oil in it.

Here is a list of how it is equipped...

- A/C

- Hard Doors

- Vinyl top in excellent condition

- AM/FM CD player

- Glass windows

- 5 speed/6 cylinder - 4.0 liter engine

- Alcoa aluminum wheels

- Front and rear brush guards

- Reese Hitch (not for towing - used for a luggage rack)

- Interior is flawless

- Nerf bars (to assist getting in/out)

Kelley Blue Book says the Jeep is worth $13,015.00 for excellent condition. My bank says the loan value is $13,525.00. A local car dealer offered me $11,400.00 in a trade in deal. Of course he low balled me because he will put the Jeep on his lot for $13,900.00, or something like that.

Neither the bank or Kelley Blue Book has an option to value the lift kit. So, the prices above are not taking in consideration the lift kit.

Selling Price: $12,000.00

Thanks for looking."
