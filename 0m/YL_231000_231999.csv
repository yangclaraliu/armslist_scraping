These guns was and still are very popular in 200yard silhouette shoots. Remington stopped making them in 1989 which is the year this little jewell was made so its the last year of production for them. I havent had it long took it on a trade and have only shot it 8 times, and it is capable of shooting sub moa at 100yards, probaly alot better but i shot a .875 group at 100 and im not a pro at the pistol. This is a really cool setup, it come with everything in picture except the bipods which includes pistol, scope, base, rings, 140 live rounds and 100+ once fired brass(which is all the rounds that have been fired through this gun since new in 1989), and a set of brand new hornady custom dies. This is suppose to be a very accurate 200yard match gun and i believe it, the ammo is sp ammo and very capable of knocking down a deer sized animal at 200yards or farther. Cash is king but would trade it for another really nice handgun or rifle that interest me( which is a very large selection) so let me know what you have by email me through armslist or u can call or text 580-317-sixty-nine43 thanks"

This gun has about 50 rounds put through it. As the model number indicates it is in 9mm caliber with 17+1 capacity. While you can do your own research on the pistol, I will list some of its features. This pistol is based off the the Taurus 24/7 OSS model Taurus tried to design for the military. It is a hammer fired DA/SA with a 3 position safety. You can carry it cocked and locked, uncocked and locked, or safety off in DA. Depressing the safety downward decocks the hammer. It has has 3 dot novak sights, and accessory rail. It is a polymer framed gun with a black tennifer finish which is similar to the glock finish or the SA XD melonite finish. 

I have the gun, the original case, a mag loader, Taurus security system keys, 2 mags total, 3 back-straps (small, medium, large), and all the paper work. Like all Taurus guns it has a lifetime warranty. 

I bought this gun for my wife, but here hands are too small. I thought the smallest backstrap would solve this problem, but its still to large. If you have smaller hands hands this is not the pistol for you. SA is fine, but the DA trigger length of pull is almost too long for me. I also have smaller hands for a guy."

Serial number is 37120XX which indicates manufacture between January and March 1944. It was a DCM rifle from years ago and I've had it for about 7 years. There are no import marks! All major parts are IBM such as barrel, stock, trigger guard. There may be more parts but I'm not sure. I have not changed or altered the rifle except for adding the sling and mag pouch but I'm about to start the process of replacing some incorrect parts. Finish and wear is even and good on all metal parts and the wood is solid with a few dings and bruises. Barrel is marked IBM Corp and dated 10-43. Bore looks crisp and the muzzle passes the ""bullet test"". Stock is marked J-LB with ordnance stamp. This rifle comes with a correct magazine stock pouch dated 1943, period sling, and three GI 15 round magazines (one is correct IBM). I'll also include a copy of ""The M1 Carbine Owner's Guide"" by Ruth & Duff. This is a great, collectable piece of history. It's a great shooter what turns heads at the range.  I'm selling this for $820. Feel free to ask questions. Serious inquiries only. No ammo included in this sale. Thanks."

Very nice Spanish Mauser FR-8 in .308 caliber! These guns were reworked from M.1943 Mauser rifles, and this one is accordingly stamped on the receiver, ""Fabrica De Armas La Coruna 1955"". The receiver displays a slightly fading Spanish crest. FR-8 was used for practice by Spanish soldiers before they were issued CETME assault rifles. The rifle has a fake gas tube installed under the barrel, to make it look like the CETME rifle. This fake gas tube is actually a cleaning kit container (the cleaning kit is not included). This gun has stronger, 1898-type action than FR-7, which was build on 1893-type action. Straight bolt handle. Stock with pistol grip. The stock does not display any markings. All matching serial numbers (the matching serial numbers are stamped on the receiver, barrel and on the bolt only; all the remaining parts do not display any numbers, which is correct for this model). CONDITION: Excellent, as rebuilt by Spanish arsenal. Most of phosphate finish is still on metal. Very nice stock has been filled in one place. Excellent bore with strong and shiny rifling. Strong action. All the internal parts of the rifle are in excellent condition, with little visible wear. Mechanically, the rifle is in great condition."

If you have a classic S&W 3"" OR SHORTER revolver that you carry, this would complement it. The rig is FITTED for a 3"" S&W revolver and has a finished factory seam sewn around the bottom so a 4"" won't fit.

Springer Precision has coupled their XD Sear and a host of springs for the benefit of improving the XD's stock trigger. With this pairing of parts, you are one step closer to a full-house trigger job. The results of the kit is a shorter, lighter, crisper trigger pull. Our testing shows that this setup will reduce your trigger's pre-travel by 50% and your trigger pull weight by 25% (two pounds or more).

We rate this M&P as only fair / refinish, since about 30 percent of its surfaces show light to moderate pitting. Mechanical condition is similar: bore and cylinder chambers are affected by very light pitting. Timing, action and lockup are quite good, but there is about 3mm of lateral play to the cylinder, and that part has pronounced endshake. Note that the grips are good, no cracks, and they appear to be original. There are some mechanical; problems with this gun and it will need to be gone over by a competent gunsmith to insure that this gun is safe.  Once fixed it should be a nice shooter to have around the house."

This PLR-16 has had exactly 160 rounds of quality brass ammunition thru it.  It has run absolutely flawlessly.  The factory 10 round magazine, original box and manual are included.  The pistol is accurate and enjoyable to shoot.  One accessory that I did not buy is the forend - which many do add at some point.  I have not found that to be an item that I needed - but I thought someone might ask - so letting you know that I do not have one.  The single point sling was a good addition since it does assist in accuracy if you hold it taught to simulate having a stock - but you do not lose the compact package the pistol configuration provides.  These come from the factory with 1/2 x 28 barrels and would make a suitable suppressor host that will sound close to an unsuppressed 22 LR.  Thank you for your interest.  I assure you that I will be very easy to work with if you decide to purchase the pistol.  I will accomodate your schedule for pick up at my location to the best of my ability and it will be as described.  I don't have any pictures but can email them if you provide your email address in any correspondence.  Honestly, it looks like any new PLR-16 with a single point sling on it.  I will not likely keep this posted for a long duration and I know will not be dropping my price.  I do my best to price anything I consider selling fairly and to the best of my knowledge better than you can buy anywhere.  This considers what one may buy for online or locally when tax and or shipping is a reality.  It is also less than I paid for the item.  Everything depreciates - and I am offering the best price I can.  Thanks very much."

It is classified as a pistol.

Hello - I need to open by stating these criteria: Not interested in trades.  Item must be picked up at my location.  Glance at valid IN Driver's license and LTCH.  No information will be recorded.  Just want too make sure purchaser can legally own a pistol. Price is absolutely firm.  (Sorry, but a few advertisements for items such as these bring quite a few interesting inquiries.)   

This PLR-16 has had exactly 160 rounds of quality brass ammunition thru it.  It has run absolutely flawlessly.  The factory 10 round magazine, original box and manual are included.  The pistol is accurate and enjoyable to shoot.  One accessory that I did not buy is the forend - which many do add at some point.  I have not found that to be an item that I needed - but I thought someone might ask - so letting you know that I do not have one.  The single point sling was a good addition since it does assist in accuracy if you hold it taught to simulate having a stock - but you do not lose the compact package the pistol configuration provides.  These come from the factory with 1/2 x 28 barrels and would make a suitable suppressor host that will sound close to an unsuppressed 22 LR.  Thank you for your interest.  I assure you that I will be very easy to work with if you decide to purchase the pistol.  I will accomodate your schedule for pick up at my location to the best of my ability and it will be as described.  I don't have any pictures but can email them if you provide your email address in any correspondence.  Honestly, it looks like any new PLR-16 with a single point sling on it.  I will not likely keep this posted for a long duration and I know will not be dropping my price.  I do my best to price anything I consider selling fairly and to the best of my knowledge better than you can buy anywhere.  This considers what one may buy for online or locally when tax and or shipping is a reality.  It is also less than I paid for the item.  Everything depreciates - and I am offering the best price I can.  Thanks very much."

I am selling a really beautiful 1945 Mosin Nagant M44 carbine.
It is an all serial matching, no forced or electro penciled numbers matching, 1945 Izhevsk M44, bore is like new, its as pristine as it gets, the bolt is as smooth as butter and the trigger pull is nice and crisp.
I took the original shellac off as it was missing in spots and gave it about 10 coats of Spar varnish that I mixed a tad bit of boiled linseed oil in and cut it with a little extra mineral spirits to make it go on thinner, hand rubbed it with 0000 steel wool in between dried coats.
Other than a small gouge in the wood on the left side, it looks like a new rifle.
It comes as is with a carbine length original sling with dog collars.

It's a very collectable piece for the Five_seveN enthusiast and comes with all the original components. $2000 Firm.

There have been several variants before the current USG model that everyone is aware of. First FN came out with a DAO model, then the Tactical, IOM and finally the USG. 

The IOM prototype was a very small run of modified Tacticals that were made for the IOM trials. It is the rarest version of FsN made. It did not come with a letter as it was pre-IOM and these were not made for sale to anyone, Officers or the public. After the trial they were given to some special people.

You can tell an ""IOM"" Prototype from a military/law enforcement only Tactical by first, the serial number is in IOM format (3861xxxxx), not Tactical format (386Mxxxxx).

This gun has a lot of money put into as you can tell and shoots wonders and it can shoot any bullet i put into it even Blazers (just to test).. It is a very accurate 1911 and a fine example of Springfield Armory 1911... It is a Light weight G.I Model but with all the work done to it it is as good and better than their Loaded 1911. This Springfield Champion is always on backorder or sold out everywhere.. Check for yourself online...

I have a Kel-tec PLR-16 for sale with accessories. It is a no stock, no buffer tube, 9"" barrel, easy to control 5.56mm (& .223) firearm, legally a pistol, although I wouldn't try dropping it down my pants.
It has a few hundred rounds through it with 0 misfires & cleaned like you wash your new car that first month. So any deburring or breaking-in has already been done.

Instead of the 10rd magazine, it comes with 2 20rd mags. It takes standard AR15 mags of whatever type you want to use, even the drums!
It has the forend on it so it has the lower picatinny for a grip, etc. It has an upper picatinny for scopes, etc.
The iron sights are adjustable. It takes standard muzzle attachments.
It has a strap and I'll throw in the carry bag. And of course private sale means no records.

Usually when you get lots of looks just taking your gun out, you've got something freaky or dangerous. I am not one of our heroes who needs a 300yd weapon. This is the perfect size to put 1,300 ft·lb of ability into the hands of somone who, in that one real-life moment, wants to bring more to the table than a 400 ft·lb handgun.

Am in NY, if you are really interested I shall ship it to a licenses holder of your choice near you after you have pay for it.

The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, Novak® night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety and Ergo XT grips.

I have 1 that I have never fired so it has only been factory fired by Sig, it is the Carry Size so it has a full size grip and a 4.2 inch barrel.  It is the threaded barrel model.  MSRP is $1285 on this gun.

I am not convinced that I want to sell it yet but for the right offer in cash or if a trade is favored in my direction I will definitely consider parting with this gun as much as I don't want to.

It has 38,000 miles and has been garage kept since bought new.  It is Yellow and has a 3"" Sky Jacker lift kit.  It has never been taken off road.  The 4 wheel drive has only been used during the winter, on a few occasions.  I have changed the oil every 3,000 miles or every 6 months as sometimes I did not put 3,000 miles on it in a 6 month period.  I have always ran premium oil in it.  

Here is a list of how it is equipped...

- A/C

- Hard Doors

- Vinyl top in excellent condition

- AM/FM CD player

- Glass windows

- 5 speed - 6 cylinder (4.0 liter)

- Aluminum wheels

- Front and rear brush guards

- Reese Hitch  (not for towing - used for a luggage rack)

- Interior is flawless

- Nerf bars (to assist getting in/out)

Kelley Blue Book says the Jeep is worth $13,015.00 for excellent condition.  My bank says the loan value is $13,525.00.   Local car dealer offered $11,800.00 for a trade in deal.  Of course he low balled me because he will put the Jeep on his lot for $14,900.00 or something like that.

Neither the bank or Kelley Blue Book has an option to value the lift kit.  So, the prices above are not taking in consideration the lift kit.

Selling Price: $13,000.00  (comes with a recent CarFax check - I ran one yesterday and it is 100% clean)

So I am listing these for sale again. I may consider trades as well. Multiple guns trades are ok. I have a variety of interests when it comes to firearms so please make offers. I will consider trades plus cash as well. It really just depends on what you have. I am an ak guy by heart but will consider other trades as well. Below is a list of all of the guns that I am offering for sale or trade. There is also a variety of ammunition for sale as well. I also have a very extensive and valuable collection of autographs for sale. This is my personal collection and I have put this collection together over the years. This is an amazing collection for any baseball fan. The total autograph collection is valued at over $20,000. I also have these items listed below. All of the autographs have proper documentation and certificates of authenticity. I prefer cash but I will consider trades on these items as well. My asking price for the entire collection is $5,500. However, I will consider any reasonable offer. I must sell these items rather quickly because I do not want the property that we are planning on purchasing to be sold. We really need the money for a larger down payment. I will consider trades and cash offers, but please be reasonable. Thanks for looking. 

GUNS: 

Custom Saiga 12 Guage Shotgun
Price: $1350
This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri mail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling mount, finger groove pistol grip, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga.

Winchester 94 AE Lever Action 30/30
Price: $425
This is a nearly prefect example of Winchester's famous lever action rifle. This 94 AE is chambered in 30/30 and has seen very little usage. I have fired this rifle very little and used it as a brush gun during hunting season only a few select times. This gun is in excellent condition and is the closest thing that you will find to new. 

Remington 770 30/06 bolt action rifle
Price: $325
I purchased this rifle a few years ago and never actually fired the rifle. I took it out one time with me hunting but never had the opportunity to fire it. This rifle is chambered in 30/06 and comes with a 3-9x40 scope mounted. The scope has never even been sighted in. It also has a camo sling mounted. This would make a perfect deer rifle for someone. 

DPMS AR-15 20"" A2 target rifle with stainless bull barrel
Price: $1,050
This rifle is the most accurate AR that I have ever shot. This is a DPMS AR-15 with an A2 stock and a 20 inch long, 1 inch diameter stainless bull barrel. This rifle has a free floating barrel and a free floating DPMS handguard, forward assist, and dust covers. The rifle also has a 6-24x44 scope that has not been sighted in. The scope has been mounted on a top rail scope mount. The rifle also has a bipod mounted. This rifle has a railed gas block and will come with two magazines as well. The stock has a few knicks and dings but nothing major. This came from shooting on a bench. The gun has been fired very little and hasn't been fired since I mounted the scope. 

Glock 22 40 S&W in OD Green
Price:$500
This is a brand new Glock and has never been fired. This is a Gen 3 glock and will come with two factory hi-capacity glock mags. I purchased this gun when I learned that Glock would no longer release any OD green glocks. I can include a blackhawk carbon fiber holster and two KCI extreme capacity glock mags for an additional $75. I believe they are 31 rounders but I am not positive. The last OD green gen 3 glock that was new in the box sold for over $500 with $25 shipping plus ffl fees on Gunbroker. This is going to be a collector's item very soon. Especially in unfired condition. 

Sig Sauer Platinum Elite 1911
Price:$1100
This is the most beautiful 1911 that you have ever seen. This pistol has never been fired. I purchased it about a year ago and placed it in my safe. This gun has night sites installed. Checkered grip, beavertail grip safety, and many other custom features. This is a beautiful pistol and would make an excellent carry weapon or one to put up as an heirloom. This is the highest end of Sig Sauer 1911's and they are getting harder and harder to find. Comes with 2 sig sauer factory mags.

Sig Sauer 2022 9mm
Price:$450
This gun is brand new in the box and has never been fired. I purchased this gun and put it in my safe. This gun is chambered in 9mm and is meant to outlast most of your other standard 9mm pistols. This will come with an extra grip that fits larger hands and one high capacity magazine. This is a compact carry gun that is in new condition. Reliability will never be an issue with this pistol. I own another of this model and have shot it regularly. It is a great pistol for the money. 

I will follow the law when selling any of my pistols or rifles. Please do not try to buy a gun from me if you are a felon or cannot possess a firearm. 


Autograph Collection
Price: $5500 or best offer

This collection is valued at over $20,000. I have much much more than my asking price invested in this collection. I am simply trying to move this collection quickly in order to put a down payment on a piece of property. I may consider trades on a few items but I really prefer cash on these autographs. I would like to sell the entire collection all at once because time is limited on my end. This would be perfect for someone to resale on ebay or for an avid collector. I simply don't have the time to sell these items individually so the first person with a reasonable cash offer will take the entire collection. I am only asking $5500 for the entire collection. You won't find a collection like this everyday, especially at this price. Below is a list of every item in my collection. I have also listed prices for what each item typically sells for. Keep in mind, I am only asking a fraction of these prices. $5500 is an absolute steal for a collection like this. I may consider shipping this collection at the buyer's expense. All of my autographs have been authenticated and all come with certificates of authenticity. Thanks for looking.

The total value of this autograph collection is around $24,265. I am only asking a fraction of this price. I am asking $5500 for the entire autograph collection. This is the best price that you will ever find. As I said, I need to sell this collection as soon as possible so please feel free to make reasonable offers. I have photos of all of the autographs and all of the guns. I have tried to post a few photos of the guns on here but the files are too large. Feel free to email me for photos of the autographs or the guns. Thanks for looking."

This Item/set-up was taken out of my Chevy Suburban to make room for a 100lbs+ dog. In Full working order with exception of a 12vdc neon tube inside the enclosure (can be replaced with ease and minimal cost). Also including remote Bass Boost module for the amp (lighted knob kind), - you will need a double mono 1/8 end cable to plug it in . As you see, there was no expense spared on this stereo (everything was purchased BRAND NEW), Amp was $800 shipped, Enclosure was $750+$150 shipping due to size/weight and capacitor was $200. So, not including all the terminals and wires, spare fuse and Bass Boost module This set-up was $1900. As you see from the pics, there are over $120 in wires and high end voltage distribution hardware. I ran this set-up via 0ga DC cables, second dedicated Optima Yellow Top Battery with upgraded to 130AMP Bosch alternator and Battery Isolator (battery isolator is available for additional $100 (which is about 60%off new) as this is a power house and, obviously draws some juice. 1 farad Capacitor helps big time, thus was added into the initial installation mix from the beginning and proved to be a huge value/addition.

These American Eagles won't work in my gun.  They fire just fine, but the rim thickness is about 15% more than any of the other rounds I tried so I got multiple failure to eject and they won't recycle the battery.  The other three brands with thinner rims I tried all worked flawlessly after several hundred rounds, with no problems at all aside a couple stovepipes.  Moral of the story...I have no use for these rounds and I can't return them.  If you shoot this stuff I'd be happy for you to take them off my hands.  They're 40 grain, 1240 fps lead round-nose.

The picture is beautiful and the TV is in excellent condition, no dings or scratches. The only issue is that the bulb recently went out and we haven't fixed it yet. The bulb can be ordered online for around $80 and is a super easy fix...we just haven't done it yet because it is our extra tv and we don't use it much. You will not find this much TV for this price anywhere else!!!
Please make me an offer, the worst I can do is say no. Any reasonable offers will be considered. I would also be willing to trade for ammo + money or handguns.
