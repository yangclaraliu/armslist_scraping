About the browning. It's a 1974 full choke. It's in pretty good shape over all. There is a ring/bulge about 22"" down the barrel that doesn't affect how it shoots but is visible. It's a good shooter and hasn't had many rounds through it, just not perfect to look at.

It has VERY minor wear and tear from a few trips to the skeet field aside from one place on the stock behing the tang safety selector where the rubber coating has peeled. I am to lazy to contact Browning about it but I am pretty confident they would make it right. I have been on the fence about posting this but finally decided to get more into precision rifles. I know, great timing right?! I am only taking trade offers or partial trade offers depending on the value of your gun.

The barrel and stock are in excellent condition. Along with the stock 10 round magazine I also have two 25 round mags for it one of which is the Ruger BX-25 mag.

I don't know much about the shotgun I got it in a trade a while back. Seems to be in good shape for it's age and the barrel closes up nice and tight. Says -Springfield- J. Stevens Arms on the reciever. Thats really all I know about it.

Can send pictures if anyones interested."

This gun has 100rds on it, I fired cheap 2 3/4in walmart loads up to 3in 00buck. Never jammed once. This gun retails for $589 and the mag extention was $80, thats $670 full blown retail price. I really want a CZ-82/83 for a ccw and I can't pony up the cash. I would like to trade my kickass shotgun for a cheap used 12ga pump in working condition and a CZ. I would consider a Bersa or Russin Makorv in .380 or 9mm, 9mm makorv and a shotgun. I am open to offers but I need a ccw gun and a working shotgun out of this trade so keep that in mind. I may do a trade for a pistol and some cash also but keep in mind what this shotgun is worth. I would expect a gun with an extra mag or two and like $150 cash. I don't expect $670 in trade but a $250/$300 dollor pistol and a $150/$200 dollor shotgun should be fair $450-500 in trade. I may take a even trade for a RI 1911 or a full size 9mm/.45acp or maybe a higher end ccw. Thanks for your time, get back to me if your interested. I will not sell it outwright, sorry."

“COMMANDER”-SIZE .45 ACP PISTOLS

By August of 1983, Randall expanded its line of pistols to include the Service Model-C configuration. The “C” stood for compact. Initially, these handguns were even roll-marked “Service Model-C.” However, in the beginning of 1984, the company decided to give the guns a new identity, and dubbed this configuration as the “Raider,” so-named for General Randall’s unit which had been known as Randall’s Raiders.

Introduced August 31, 1983, the first in the Service Model-C series was the A211, which featured a round-top slide and fixed sights. Barrel length was 4.25-inches, making the over-all length .75-inch less than the standard A111. Magazine capacity (7) and height remained the same. Weight of the A211 was 36 ounces, compared to 38 ounces for the full-sized Model A111. After 992 of the Model A211 pistols were made, production of that model ceased on September 6, 1984.

The latest model of the Just One family shares the essential features of all of the others in the line. It's extremely versatile. Starting at an ultra-compact 2300 cubic inches, it expands to 4600 with its built-in Cam Expansion™ system. Add a Super Spike Duffel's 2900 cubic inches, and you get a 7500 cubic inch load hauler. The photo above shows the full sequence.
 The J34 is the latest refined version of our original Just One design. Each year, we look for small details to improve upon, in a continuous quest to make our products better. The J34 features a new streamlined shape, vertically adjustable torso length, waterproof zippers, a high-visibility interior (no more groping for a black flashlight in a black compartment), deep ""3D"" ventilated padding, scabbard drainage and cleanout access.
 Otherwise, as many of our customers have requested from us, the basic foundation of this pack is the same good thing we've been offering for several years. The J34 is still the same terrific all-around pack; it's suspension is designed to move with your body, making it comfortable to wear as a daypack, and the pack is supremely capable and comfortable under a heavy load. Try one, and see why there's a growing movement afoot in the hunting community that's saying that the Just One is the best hunting pack ever built.
 People are really impressed when they see how our Just One can grow into a terrific meat pack. The logic is simple: the pack is made to fit right behind your torso for active hunting. It's very compact and doesn't protrude far from your body, so it doesn't get in your way. Then, when you have game down, open the pack up and start hauling meat. Our tough, soft-finish camo packs have an exclusive ventilated mesh-fronted meat compartment, so your meat will be able to cool while you pack it.
 With our Quickdraw Backscabbard™, you can reach over your shoulder and quickdraw your firearm, arrows from a quiver, etc. As with all of our packs, the Just One is hydration system compatible.
 The J34 weighs 6 lbs. 14 oz. It's very comfortable as a daypack, and as shown by the photos at the top of the page, is capable -- and still comfortable -- while hauling very heavy loads. The volume is variable, from about 2300 cubic inches to a little over 4600 cubic inches, then to about 7100 cubic inches when used with the Spike Camp Duffel. Choose the Super Spike Duffel, and you can go all the way to 7500 c.i. 
Quiet! ...We're getting some terrific feedback about our products, and have a growing number of ""true believers"" out there who are enthusiastically telling all of their buddies about what great packs we've got. The story typically goes, ""I gave Jerry my Just One to try, and he liked it so much that he wouldn't give it back for three days."" One reason they love it is because of its comfort. And of course, it's pretty hard to beat the kinds of innovations that we've incorporated in our designs. But a key feature that's difficult to describe but is extremely important in a hunting pack is that it's quiet. It rides your back like it's attached to you, and doesn't swing around, which is one of the things that makes typical packs noisy. In addition to that, it's configured in a way that minimizes parts rubbing on one another. So, when you're walking through a still forest, all you're going to hear is... silence. We think you'll like what you don't hear."

This is a great pocket carry pistol.  It is less than an inch wide and weights only 15.5 oz when loaded.  It holds 7+1.  The slide was refinished by CCR refinishing with the Cera Hide coating.  It is much more durable and wear resistant than the original finish.  It is a great little gun and you can't beat the price.  I will ship it to your dealer at your expense.

It has only been assembled and test fired (less than 30 rounds).  Works flawlessly.  It has:
16"" 1in8 twist Spikes Tactical heavy barrel (Melonite coated for superior corrosion resistance)
Adams Arms mid length gas piston kit
Midwest Industries mid length two piece free float rail
YHM flash hider

If you all ready have an AK-74, a bunch of 5.45 ammo and an AR it would be a great way to add another rifle to your inventory without having to purchase another lower receiver for an outrageous amount of money.  The gas piston kit and two piece lower make cleaning a breeze especially for the 5.45 ammo.  If you have any questions please ask.  I have many more pictures as well.  FTF $1200 or I will ship it on your dime.  Thanks!"

It's an awesome gun and I have had a great time with it. It will certainly turn heads at the range as well as fill the role as an extremely effective weapon for home defense. My reasons for listing are pretty much simply due to the fact that I would like to consolidate my rifle collection into only a few separate calibers for convenience and stockpiling purposes."

UPDATED>>>>>>>>>>Wanted to comment on a few emails and phone calls I have received on this listing. This weapon was brought into the country from Romania as a pistol and is not a converted rifle. Currently this weapon and a few others are not included in the well known parts count law because there is no mention of assault pistols, only assault rifles.  I am not a lawyer but that is how it has been explained to me by well versed gun owners and some online research, I suggest you do your homework. There is some talk that this will be one of the first loopholes to disappear so get them while you can."

When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups. All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. New, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” Updated material and design features in our 30-round magazine.

I have a brand new Black Rain Ordnance AR-15 that has never been fired. You probably have never heard of them because they make mil speced guns that are CNC machined for perfection. So there not mass produced pieces of junk. Do your research and look them up. You will realize that these guns do infact cost thousands of dollars and that I'm not putting a high price tag on a piece of junk.  I can tell you that they are worth every penny as well. I had the opportunity to buy two of them a couple of months ago so I didn't hesitate, but now that I'm getting married the wife wants me to give one up. I'm only trying to make a couple hundred more than what I paid for it so please no low ball offers. Like I said this is not a 1000 gun that I'm trying to sell for 3000 like some people. This gun cost me 2100 dollars at cabelas then i added 600 dollars worth of parts not including tax and shipping cost onto that, if you don't want the scope and extras that I have put on it I will sell just the gun for 2500 dollars.
