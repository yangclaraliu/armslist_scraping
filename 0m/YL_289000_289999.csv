This has a 6.25 inch barrel and Hogue grip.  Adjustable sights with orange painted front ramp.  Extremely accurate handgun.  zThis is a double action and can be fired with hammer lowered or cocked.  This can shoot both 44 magnum and 44 special if you or others shooting want a lighter recoiling gun.  The 6.25 inch barrel works well for taming recoil.  This was bought second hand but I've personally only put about 3 boxes of ammo through it and have never carried it.  It's a safe queen.
Asking 650 but I also have ammo that can be sold to buyer for extra."

Unfortunately I was shoting it and lost the firing pin at the range.  So it needs parts installed to be functional.  I'm by no means a gun smith and have little to no desire to become one to fix it.

So, I'm listing it for sale or trade to anyone who is interested.  I have 100 rounds of ammo to go with.  50 Winchesters and 50 Remingtons.  Comes with the original box and paper work.  I bought the gun about 5 years ago at a gun show.  It has the tip up barrell design.  It is a pocket sized pistol and very concealable.  The ammo cost about $25 a box, and I would accept offers on it too alone if that is all that interest you.  

I'd be glad to show anyone the pistol, and if you have a knack for working on guns this should be a good find at a good price.
I'd also consider trades of any type.
Any reasonable offer will be responded too.

Over the next few weeks I'll be making frequent trips between Sandusky and Youngstown OH and can arrange a meeting with advanced notice anywhere up and down I-80 in between the two cities."

From the Powder River Precision website about the trigger kit (plus I am including the stock trigger):
""This Drop in Trigger Kit fits all XDM pistols including the new XDM5.25"". The kit contains our famous striker safety lever, to remove the long trigger pre-travel on the XDM trigger. Reduced power: trigger spring, sear spring, striker safety spring and striker spring, to lower the pull weight. Our trigger is made of tough light weight polymer that helps speed up the reset. It also has an integral over travel stop on the back of the trigger. Using this method of over travel stop removes added stress on the trigger bar that are present with any of the other over travel stop methods. This trigger is a Springfield Armory OEM part available on production XD and XDM pistols from the factory (see APPENDIX D4 — 21.6 Production Division Rules). When installed correctly, the kit will give you a short crisp trigger pull (about 3.5-4.5lbs) with a fast reset and shorten the total trigger pull length. Fits all XDMs.""  [url]http://shop.powderriverprecision.net/product.sc?productId=73&categoryId=3[/url]

From the Pistol Gear website about the Patriot Magwell:
""PistolGear is proud to offer the first IDPA legal magwell to the XDm marketplace. Tweaking our design for the benefit of an affective product that will fit the IDPA box, this magwell will make your ESP machine rock! The PistolGear ""Operator"" magwell for the XDm doubles the width of the frame funnel for the benefit of smoother tactical reloads. The magwells locks onto the frame in two locations making it rigid. The magwell is held in place by a threaded pin that replaces the factory grip insert pin, making installation easy and non-permanent. YOU DO NOT EPOXY THIS PRODUCT TO YOUR FRAME. 

This set up new would cost you as follows:
Springfield XDm 5.25 out the door price from SSP (pistol, shipping, sales tax) - $754
PRP Drop in Trigger Kit - $125
Patriot Magwell - $85
Total Out The Door would be $954 if buying new, I don't expect that at all.

As for what I am looking for, I would like to trade a nice stainless (would consider other than stainless) 1911 in the ""Commander"" size.  i.e. Colt Commander, Kimber Pro, Springfield Champion, etc... I would also be interested if somebody just happens to have an upper chambered in 300 AAC Blackout but I doubt that will happen.  I might consider other offers so just let me know what you have.

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller than the former N-cell battery sight (511/551) and runs on a single 123 battery. It also has a longer battery life than the N-cell style sights.

•   Shortened base only requires at most 2.75"" of rail space compared to the 4"" N battery sights
•   Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
•   Battery compartment is now separated from the base to allow it to hover over the delta ring of the rifle
•   Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 500-600 hours, 3X battery life of N cell sights

Its still TIGHT and doesnt effect function. I wrapped it in a bit of paracord b/c my hands are a bit bigger, its NOT holding the stock together.

This is a very nice revolver and it's in excellent condition. Completely stock. I've only put about 100 rounds through it but it's been very reliable. Accurate and powerful. It would make a great HD gun or even a CCW if you're good with revolvers. It's been my nightstand gun for the last two years. I clean and lube it at least once a month and every time I fire it. I'll of course throw in whatever ammo I have for it but I think it's only a little over 20 rds of CCI hollow point.

I would definitely consider a trade for a tactical pump action shotgun. Something with a short barrel, preferably a 12g."

$1000.00 or best offer or trade, 

I found something i want but guy needs cash so i lowered price this is a steal ----------->FIRST ""G"" TAKES IT HOME !

AMT Automag III .30 CARBINE semi-auto stainless steel hunter Automag Kit.
I am the original owner of this handgun i purchased it in 1981-82 and have fired it around 200 cartridges to zero scope and millet adjustable target sites.
I cannot find any cosmetic issues it really shows like new being kept in its case nearly 30 years.
The original scope was a weaver 2x but it sports a bushnell troghy 
multi-dot / cross hair optic. the scope mount is detachable letting you bring the .30 carb back to a non-scoped version in a minute while the scope mount is factory fitted never looses its adjustment  when re-installed. This firearm has never malfunctioned and while at the range you need to keep everything of value behind the muzzle as it is really a 2ft. flame thrower using winchester hp's. Very accurate well beyond 100 yards with muzzle energy , ft. pounds and velocity exceeding that of a .357 magnum using optimum hunting loads available from wisconsin cartridge co. 
This package deal also comes with a U.S.A. MADE SHOULDER HOLSTER and spare magazine case with bullet loops. 
I really am not in a hurry to part with this AUTOMAG just seeing what trades might be out there. 
I am just kinda bored and want to try something different. I like 1911 platform handguns prefer 70 series colts. I will trade even up for a 
colt AR-15 sp-1 with forward assist . Smiths are also a passion of mine and really only interested in 4 model glocks, g-17 desert storm commerative , g26, g27 and g20-10 mil hunter with 6 inch hunting barrel.  Let me know what you have we can go cash+firearm or firearm of equal value or straight up cash.
This item is available for FTF. transaction with written receipt and wisconsin DL#. Out of state buyers this transaction can only be done through a Registered FFL holder at your expence.
Thank-you"

Intended to operate reliably under an unbelievably wide variety of climatic conditions, this rifle was developed from the venerable Kalashnikov assault rifle.  There are many different buttstocks, fore ends, and optics that you can put on it, and it shoots all ammunition reliably (basically, you could put a rock in it and it would fire it!).  

The rifle has an integrated rail for a sight/scope mount on the left side of the receiver.  The sight mount comes up the left side and curves over the top of the weapon.  When the sight mount and scope are mounted, the iron sights can still be used.  

Attached to the sight/scope rail is a genuine UTG Sight/Scope Mount with a Quick Detach Lever and both side and top Picatinny rails.  Mounted to the Quick-Detach UTG is a Simmons 6.5 - 20 x 50mm adjustable scope.  With a max power of 20x and an aperture of 50mm, you can see to the moon with this thing!  You can positively identify your target and accurately place your shot with this beast of a scope.

Included in this package are one 8-round and one 24-round magazine, two extra stocks (one ""Club-foot"" and one ""Hunting-style"" stock), and 360 rounds of 150 grain Jacketed Soft Point (JSP) Federal Premium ammunition packed in a .50 cal military ammo can.  This ammo retails for about a dollar a round for a reason - it is some of the best .308 made.

9mm with stainless slide. Comes with box, instructions, and spare floor-plate for magazine. This pistol is perfect for daily concealed carry. Galco inside waistband holster is made of soft suede leather and very comfortable. Why buy a tiny .380 pocket pistol when you can use a 9mm like law most enforcement trust their lives to. This pistol is very close to size as most .380 pistols but handles much nicer.

Price is firm.
Will trade for:
Ruger MKIII stainless with bull-barrel or slab-sided.
Any quality AR15 platform.
Lever action rifles by Browning, Henry, Winchester, or Rossi, chambered in a substantial cartridge will be strongly considered.

Must be 21 with valid Ohio license. Concealed carry license holder is a plus (let the sheriff's office do the background check for me).

The SureFire Helmet Light is ideal for navigation and close-quarter work like reading maps and documents, loading gear, or repairing equipment in the field. Surefire makes this LED flashlight from tough, weatherproof Nitrolon polymer and equips it with virtually indestructible light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The lightweight SureFire HL1 Headlamp attaches directly to the side of any TC 2000 MICH (Modular Integrated Communications Helmet). SureFire HL1 Watertight Helmet Flashlight uses a single 123A lithium battery and six LEDs to produce three different types of light at multiple power levels.

This compact, multiple-output LED Helmet Light by Sure-Fire features three white or yellow-green LEDs, two blue / red / IR LEDs, and one blinking red infrared LED that serves as a personal Identify Friend or Foe beacon. The white LEDs are perfect for general-purpose, close-work illumination; the blue lights of the Surefire light serve the same purpose in a low-signature, night-vision-friendly color. Sure Fire HL1 Tactical Head Flashlight attaches via a special mount that clamps semi-permanently to the rim of the helmet by means of two socket-head machine screws. Once attached, the flashlight can be easily slid onto the mount, where locks into place; depressing a small lever slides the Surefire headlamp right off.

While designed primarily for military and SWAT applications, the SureFire Helmetlight is also an option for caving, climbing, construction, or search-and-rescue operations - pretty much any activity involving wearing a helmet and requiring low-output, hands-free illumination."

He had a used one in his glass with no rail for 750.00 with scratches.

This is  a very good Sig P229R with a front rail, Equinox wood grips, 2 - 12 round magazines, it can be used for both .40 and .357 sig rounds. I have both barrels marked by Sig Sauer, and I also have the original plastic black grips.  The standard P229 has no rail to mount a light or laser, this one does. The barrels change in 30 seconds. 

That is for the full rig with NO ammo. It has been rated as VGC with only the ""Sig Smilies"" on the barrels which is on all Sigs after a few rounds.
The Equinox grips were 200 dollars and they do not even sell them anymore unless you buy the equinox model. 

The gun itself with a mag and original plastic grips I will let go for $650, 50 bucks less than Buds Guns: 

http://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/411547811

I can always sell the extras and ammo for more then the 200.00 difference from the list price, the grips an easy 125, and the extra barrel an easy 100 , the ammo an easy 225, ---or you can have it all for 850 crisp bills with e .40 ammo AND the .357 Sig, saving you big bucks as the ammo on cheaper than dirt runs 48 bucks per box for federal premium Hollow points, and you get 5 boxes. thats 250 bucks alone in Sig, plus another 90 bucks in the .40.

Has original box, lock, with all the original stuff. It's a great piece but I have quite a few handguns. You get two guns for the price of 1! Plus if you want, you can buy the 9mm conversion kit and use the same mags. Just get the barrel and spring. Very versatile, incredibly accurate and I keep my guns clean as a whistle. This one has had about 300 rounds through it. 

A good condition used p229 goes between 600-700 without the rail built in. 

Add the extra barrel at over 150 bucks, the grips at almost 200 bucks, close to 350.00 in  ammo, it'll be a great gun for someone. 

Illinois MUST have FOID and ID, I will sell to Wisconsin or Indiana residents but you'll have to come see it here or at the Wisconsin border area. Trades listed below, make an offer but make it fair or I won't even reply. 

If you want the basic gun with no extras, I will sell it for 650.00 and resell the other stuff. I'll actually make more this way, but why not grab 550 bucks in extras for the other 200 bucks?"

In the late 1970's, this pistol was adopted by the German Federal Police's counter-terrorism unit (GSG 9) and the army's special forces. The most unique feature is it's ""squeeze cocking."" The unique HK cocking lever allows the P7 to be carried safely with a round in the chamber, yet it is ready to fire by the intentional squeezing of the fingers around the grip. Releasing the cocking lever decocks the P7 immediately and renders it completely safe. The cocking lever also serves as the slide release.

It has 5 spring loaded latches and an o-ring seal. It also has an air pressure release valve and places for pad locks which makes it airline approved. These retail for around $125.00 new. The only thing that will need to be replaced is the pick-n-pluck foam. I have used this for 2 different configurations and the only thing left of the foam is the outside perimeter. I called Plano a few months ago and inquired about getting a new foam sheet and they told me it would be $15 plus shipping. You could also go to your local crafts store and buy a sheet of high-density foam and cut it yourself for a custom fit. Feel free to email me with questions or reasonable offers. Emails come straight to my phone so I usually answer pretty quickly. I can also send additional photos if requested. The AR15 in the picture is only there to show the size of the case. It has a 16"" barrel and stock fully extended. Thanks."

I recently bought an iPhone 4S, so I am needing to part with my 32 GB iPod Touch.

It's screen is in great shape, but there are scratches on the back side. You can tell it's 3rd generation by the model number. It's a blast, surfs the net, plays games, plays songs, checks stocks, checks e-mail, has access to maps, keeps time etc. It's a hand held Apple computer. There's even a word processing app you can get!

From what I've seen this is a fair price. I've priced it out on e-bay, and on here and this seems to be the going rate. I will entertain other offers though.

It's wiped clean and ready to store all your info and apps! Just send me an e-mail and we can arrange a FTF sale or set up a way to ship it. Thanks!"
