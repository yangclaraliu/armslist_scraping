Best I can judge comparing it to the pictures in the Blue Book of Gun Values, this pistol falls in the 90-95% category. What makes this pistol much more valuable is the solid Mother of Pearl grips it wears.  These were not standard. The barrel has the patent dates Aug 5 1884, June 5 1900, and July 4 1905 clearly (though extremely small) stamped on the top. Gun obviously has not been shot much as the bore is just like new and the cylinder sports very light rotational indexing marking.  Blue Book value is roughly $500, but these beautiful grips add significantly to that figure.  I will sell for $700

These are considered to be some of the best milled AK rifles ever. Made in Bulgaria, these rifles were imported in sporting configuration. The SA-93 is a copy of the original Type III AK, with a 45 degree gas block. The SLR-95 has a 90 degree gas block, and some sport a muzzle break that is pinned in place. The SA-93 rifles are dressed in a wood stockset, while the SLR-95 wears polymer. These rifles have original chrome lined hammer forged barrels and Bugarian milled receivers, some of the best. Chambered in 7.62x39 and will accept all AK mags. A must have if you are into milled receivers or are looking for a base for an AK47 build.

I will look at all very serious trades or offers but I will ask that you dont bother with junk or waist my time with games or rediculues e-mails. I am not interested in gouging people or exploiting a sad and tragic series of events, however the odds are these high cap mags are soon to be gone for good and production from Glock has stopped. They are long gone from gun shops and sold out everywhere on line. I will not trade or sell them at face value or less but will be fair and not rip people off like many others. The Custom Glock 17 pictured is not for sale or trade unless we are looking at a very substantial trade for a high end assault rifle or ? Thank you for taking a look."

I have another post for the same thing but for cash or trade of like items. Someone may be looking for a late Christmas present or something.

You are looking at a Traxxas T-Maxx 3.3. The truck is in good condition with normal wear and tear and scratches. It has been adult owned and NOT abused. See below:

Traxxas T-Max 3.3 4x4 Nitro Powered RC Truck
Traxxas HP Exhaust
Big Bore Shock Conversion (stock parts come with the truck)

Extras:
Traxxas TQ1 Radio 2.4GHZ. (Downloadable app for tuning)

Air Filter Oil
After Run Oil
Traxxas EZ Start
2 batteries for EZ Start

2 Tire Wrenches

As mentioned, this truck does have normal wear and tear scratching. It was not abused or beat up. ALL maintenance has been performed, and the truck has an absolutely perfect tune on it. The engine runs really strong. No issues with servos or transmission. I used to race RC's competitively as a child so I know all about proper tuning and maintenance of them. 

Reason for selling: Have too many projects and too many interests and simply do not have the time to run the truck. 

I can be reached at 585 322 four two three seven. My name is Kevin.

I'm selling a lightly used Colt Defender Lightweight (07000D) in .45ACP. It has seen very minimal use, and has been kept in the safe for several years. The gun is in very good condition, and shows very slight signs of use (see pictures). It comes complete with box, original factory paperwork, and 2 Colt mags. Though never carried, it does come with a nice leather holster. I prefer a FTF sale in the DFW area. Price is $850.

I am not entertaining any trade offers at this time, as this gun is only being sold to fund the future purchase of a Colt Gold Cup Trophy. If you've got one that you're willing to part with, then I'd be willing to trade + cash for the right deal. Thanks for looking.

This is a custom build on a Sun Devil Arms lower and Vltor MUR upper. Also included is a Leupold Mark 4 in a Larue SPR mount, details below. I am the second owner of this firearm. Since owning this, I have put approximately 120 rounds down the barrel. I believe the previous owner shot it maybe 200-300 rounds. I want to go back to a lightweight 14.5-16"" carbine and keep my bolt guns for long range stuff. However, this rifle has done great at distance. I recently shot it in a precision rifle match where it performed flawlessly from 200-600 meters. I haven't developed a load for this yet. I do know 77gr SMKs shoot very well out of this, particularly FGMM 77gr. The firearm has been painted with Krylon in shades of tan, works very well in the plains areas for coyotes and varmints.

Best I can judge comparing it to the pictures in the Blue Book of Gun Values, this pistol falls in the 90-95% category.

The barrel has the patent dates Aug 5 1884, June 5 1900, and July 4 1905 clearly (though extremely small) stamped on the top. Gun obviously has not been shot much as the bore is just like new and the cylinder sports very light rotational indexing marking.

It is their Smooth Carbine model 8200. This is a complete high end factory rifle, not something put together in a basement. If you are looking for a top of the line rifle, this is it. It has an excellent trigger and is very accurate. I am able to consistently ring steel at 500+ yards with this rig. It only has 330 rounds of factory ammo fired, and was always properly cleaned and maintained. It is nearly like new and will come with the case it came with from the factory. 

I have added a few upgrades to make the rifle even better. I installed a Troy Battle Ax stock which gives a great cheek weld and also makes it more effective as a CQB rifle. I added a Ergo Grip which is a big increase over the stock grip, and a Magpul RSA. The factory stock is included as well

The optic is a Trijicon TA01NSN-DOC. It has been upgraded with a GG&G Accucam Mount with integral lense covers. The optic has an MSRP of $1,800, and the mount sells for $192. It comes complete with its Pelican case, all paperwork including decals, tools and Docter information.

Price for rifle: $2,300
Rifle with ACOG: $3,300

The buyer will also have the option of purchasing up to 10 Magpul Windowed PMAGS for $30 each, and up to 2,000 rounds of Federal .223 at $635 per 1,000.

Any questions please ask. Atlas Bipod shown in photos is not included in the sale. Thanks for taking the time to look."

Bought new this past year, never fired only used as carry weapon.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters."

I'm not for sure of the nomenclature for these mags but I can say these are the newest version of aluminum mags the military is buying. They have an even feed spring that cuts way down on jams. As where the older version didn't have this and was more susceptible to jams. The plastic guides on the older mags would allow the round/rounds to teeter totter as they were guided up into the weapon thus giving you problems.

To complete this top of the line package, the rifle is topped with a new Trijicon TA11 Acog. It has the red doughnut reticle with the bullet drop compensator (BDC) for the .223/5.56 round. The optic alone sells for over $1,250 and is the perfect setup for the rifle which will shoot MOA at 100 yards.

I have seen off brand Frankenstein parts guns with garbage Chinese optics for for $4,000. Don't waste your money. Here you can have an excellent setup with nothing but the best components.

Everything is new, the paperwork and warranty cards are included for the Acog and the RRA. The bag of accessories hasn't been opened for the RRA, but if someone wants a photo of the items I can do that. It may have some light storage marks, but has never been fired unless it was at the factory.

Rifle: $2,200
Rifle and ACOG: $3,100

The buyer will also have the option of purchasing up to 10 Magpul Windowed PMAGS for $30 each, and up to 2,000 rounds of Federal .223 at $635 per 1,000.

If you have any questions please ask. This may be your last chance to get a rifle like this, and with no paperwork. Buyer must be 18 or older an Ohio resident, and legally able to own this. Thank you for taking the time to look.

The rifle has only had 200 rounds fired, mainly Nosler Custom Match. However even with Mil-Surp it will ring steel at 600 yards all day long. You will not find a better shooting LR-308 on online.

As you can see, no expense was spared. Keep in mind the magazines alone are bringing upwards of $100 each. The scope was $800, the Docter $300 and the Larue Adapter was over $260 with the red dot adapter. The beauty of this setup is the ability to shoot out to long ranges, and then use the Docter for CQB. The recoil is very minimal thanks to the break, and handles very well. The rifle comes with a nice hard case and the scope will come with its original box as well. Everything is in amazing condition, and the new owner will be very happy.

What is included:
DPMS LR-308
Burris 3x12x50mm EuroDiamond Scope with Ballistic Plex reticle

Has anyone tried to trade with the guy in greenwood on the glock mags in the above ad? I even spoke to him on the phone.I mailed my mags with comfirmation.They made it to him.I got nothing in return.Has this happened to anyone ? I got his po office number.Its been since last week since I heard from him. His ad is still active.two phone calls and many texts and no replies. It was a swap of 10rd glock 27 for 10rd glock 29.He has a illinois phone number.Im trying to be patient.Maybe he went out of town?"

Those gouging on AR and lowers are NO DIFFERENT than the scum who price gouged people on generators during the ice storms. 

And for the gun shops: We're keeping track. If your prices went up because of the clown in the White House, we'll be spending more of our money at Academy, Walmart, Bud's, etc. guilt free. You want us to support a local business while you screw local guys? Not all of the shops are guilty btw.

  The possibility of any big gun control measures passing the House are about as good as you price gougers procreating (I'm sure you'll have to Google that word).

I have taken this rifle to the range with me on two occasions each time bringing two 50 round boxes of brass cased ammunition so I can tell you with certainty that exactly 200 rounds have passed through the chamber. During that time, proper barrel break in procedures were performed and the rifle performs excellently-both reliable and deadly accurate. Rhino Arms is a small, custom manufacturer that produces AR-15 rifles exclusively. The rifle came set up in standard M16A2 format except with a reinforced mag well and a removeable instead of fixed carry handle sight. I have of course kept all the original parts, (which are not pictured, but will be included) though I have installed a few accesssories, including: an AIM sports quad rail and vertical grip and a Stag Arms retractable butt stock.

Also included with the sale is 1 GI aluminum 30 round magazine and 1 10 round Rhino Arms magazine for hunting. Though I barely used the rifle, the quality of build and performance is extremely high. The only reason I have decided to part with it has to do with the possibility of an impending ban which has forced me to consolidate my weaponry and focus on my ammunition stores for my other rifles, (I am admittedly, a bigger fan of the AK-47)."
