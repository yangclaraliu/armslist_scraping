The gun features a 6 month old trijicon front night sight, extended factory slide release, grip plug, 3 15 round factory mags, a fobus retention holster for a glock 17/19, a full box of Remington Golden sabers 124 grain +p (box of 25), factory case, and as a added bonus I have a partial box of Speer Gold Dot 380 auto ammo that I will throw in as well if you want it (normally a box of 20, has 14 rounds left). This gun also has had the disconnector polished by a licensed glock armorer and gunsmith so the gun has one of the smoothest trigger pulls possible with a factory trigger installed (trigger pull is still exactly a 5.5 lb trigger pull, but there is no perceivable ""grit"" sometimes associated with glocks). This is in overall very good/excellent condition with very few wear marks on the gun as it has been well taken care of, and has had around 350-450 rounds put through it since it was bought new. 

Im only looking for Beretta 92 type pistols chambered in 9mm only  (and I MEAN Beretta brand pistols, not at all interested in the taurus knock offs) at the moment and I expect them to be in similar overall condition to the glock (very good/excellent condition) with at least 2 factory 15-17 round mags depending on the version. Im not willing to thrown in any cash in trade as it  would be a straight across trade affair and would like to stay in the Springfield/Ozark/Nixa area for a ftf trade. I would prefer to trade only but if you want to buy with cash it is 500 bucks firm.

Best way to reach me is via text (phone number is REDACTED) or email me. Im not able to answer the phone all the time but again im able to read texts or emails through my phone so that is best. Thanks and hope to do some tradin soon."

NEWLY ARRIVED 
Inron MY803 Folding EDC Pocket Knife w/Black G10 Handle
""Poor Man's Hinderer""

As a knife enthusiast, you may be ""in the know"" about the high quality yet low cost Sanrenmu, Enlan, and Ganzo knives. 

These little known knife manufacturers are credited with making some very high quality, well designed yet affordable folder knives especially well suited for every day carry purposes. In fact if you have any contacts within the knife/cutlery trade you will find out that Ganzo, Sanrenmu and Enlan's other activities include manufacturing knives for numerous western brands such as Benchmande, Spyderco, Buck, and SOG. So believe me when I say you're getting a lot for your money with these guys.

Now there's a new name to add to this list of quality folders. Enter Inron Cutlery with there beautifully made model MY803, aka ""the poor man's Hinderer"" so called for its strikingly similar design to that of the Rick Hinderer XM18. Of course this is comparing apples to very expensive oranges but you still get a similar look and ergonomic feel for the price of an XM18 washer.

The MY803 is a good sized folder at 8.8"" in total length with a 3.85"" high hollow ground blade. The blade steel is a 9Cr13MoV which is similar to 440C steel (more so than the older 8Cr13Mov is). This is a framelock knife with ""flipper"" action as well as ambidextrous thumb studs. 

I would say the MY803 has an excellent fit and finish for the price. Good detent, very solid lock up without any blade play. It has a flat head pivot screw for easy adjustments and it's ergonomic, oversized handle (easily used with a gloved hand) is made from G10 and is available in 3 color options. 

This solid knife weighs in at 5.6oz using drilled steel liners for weight reduction. For a larger EDC knife, the very slim profile design carries surprisingly well in the pocket. It comes tip up and right hand carry only.

It is the real thing and was originally tan in color but the outer shell was painted while in country on the back of a buddy who gave it to me when he came home. It is very real and rated to 9mm and hasn't taken a round or shrapnel blast. It has however been used and not in new in box shape but it doesn't need to be. 

Okay general questions
Yes it is real and is rated to stop a bullet, having said that what you do with it is entirely on you and I am not responsible if you ""test it"". Its meant for collecting but having said that I would trust it and I have worn it more then once while working security. 
It does have the space for the ceramic body armor inserts but I don't have them. They go for 200-300 on ebay or at any gun show if you really need em I can probably help locate them just let me know.
Sizing I am 6'2 with a 44inch chest and I have to snug it up pretty good so lets call it a large. It is military issue and has the Point Blank tags so all those markings are intact.
All the MOLE straps are intact and in great shape can easily be used for true tactical use or for Air Soft purposes and I can even help you build a kit

Open to trades
Hell yes I would love to trade it but I need the value to be around 150 retail, cash I can take less but I need that number to be around 100 but I have some flexibility in partile trade cash or what ever its just gathering dust but it isnt taking up alot of space so be reasonable.
What I am looking for 
Silver coins, real silver lets call it 5oz's worth of silver puts me in the price range I need to be

It also is the only version that accepts standard AR-15 magazines. The collapsible stock folds the rifle up into a very compact package, and it can be fired while folded. When the stock is extended it locks up extremely tightly. It also has a threaded barrel (1/2x28) to accept any standard flash suppressor or other muzzle device. The barrel length is 16"", so it is legal without an SBR stamp.

I bought this from another guy. He said it was brand new, and I have not fired it. It is in nearly perfect condition, but to be honest it does appear to me as if it MAY have been fired. Regardless, it is in fantastic shape and is either new or nearly new. The retail on these is $780, I am selling mine for $525."

Great for the range, home defense, or even deer hunting. This would make a fantastic brush gun. Guns like this have already become harder to get, and depending on the results of the upcoming election, they may be even harder to find.

Further described as a Japan Grade 1. It has a 22"" barrel which is easily removed for compact storage. Hence the description, ""Take Down Model"". It shoots .22 short rounds only and has a tube capacity of 16 rounds. I am only rating it as good condition because of a hair line crack in the neck of the stock which has not affected the sturdiness or function in any way. Otherwise I would rate it very good to excellent. If it were NIB, it would sell for $1000. Comes with a tasco scope mounted with the correct hardware for this model. This rifle is very nice looking, fully functional, and dependabe. As you check other listings on gunbroker.com and other sites, you'll find my price is low. I just want to enhance my tactical stuff. I prefer cash or ammo, but will consider trades for quality firearms. I can add other firearms to a trade for something of greater value. See my other listings. FTF in Knoxville area only."

Now, I'm sure many of you are thinking ""what?! why would i want to buy some Cetme that looks like it was welded together by a Liberal Arts Major?!?!"" but Fear not! This is NOT that Cetme!

This is the version was produced with a much better receiver and the actual HK style barrel sights (as opposed to the earlier mentioned 1st-year-machinist-welding-project pin-wheel atrocity!)

I've had this bad boy for a while and it is a BLAST (Pun intended). Very fun to shoot and haven't had a failure yet! I've put about 300 rounds through it and the previous owner kept it as his safe queen so she's in pretty good shape

comes with:
-4 HK manufacture mags
-2 double pouches
-1 30 rnd after market mag

All in all this is one fun package for some one looking to upgrade to the 7.62x51 battle rifle!

Accuracy is great, didn't have any problems ringing steel at 1-300 yds, which isn't an amazing feet, but just the same it was a lot of fun!

Anywho, not really looking for anything in trade right now. Looking for cash to fund another temptation of my ADHD gun desires

Looking to get $850 on this bad boy, if you want to make a REASONABLE offer feel free!!

I'm located in the Parker area, and would like to do FTF, no bad guys, I will want to see a CODL!"

The Virginia State Police has reported that attacking dogs have been stopped dead in their tracks by a single shot, whereas the former 147 grain 9 mm duty rounds would require multiple shots to incapacitate the animals. Proponents of the hydrostatic shock theory contend that the energy available in the .357 SIG is sufficient for imparting hydrostatic shock with well-designed bullets. Users have commented, ""We're really impressed with the stopping power of the .357 SIG round.""

The bottleneck shape of the .357 SIG cartridge makes feeding problems almost non-existent.] This is because the bullet is channeled through the larger chamber before being seated entirely as the slide goes into full battery. Flat point bullets are seldom used with other autoloader platforms because of feeding problems; however, such bullets are commonly seen in the .357 SIG chambering and are quite reliable, as are hollow-point bullets.
The ""Accurate Powder"" reloading manuals claims that it is ""without a doubt the most ballistically consistent handgun cartridge we have ever worked with.

Included in the box are 2 .308 Magpul PMAGS, manual, chamber flag, and all the usual stuff that comes with rifles nowadays. The serial number on this firearm numbers under 400, a little factiod that I think is pretty cool. I had my eyes on one of these rifles for a while now, but circumstances have changed and I figure that this rifle can find a happy home out there somewhere. I am asking $2,800 for it, and of course I am really only interested in selling the firearm to Illinois residents that possess a FOID card.
I am also throwing in my old scope, which is a Blackhawk brand 3-9x40mm scope with a mil-dot reticle, adjustable for windage and elevation in 1/10th mil increments. It has a one inch tube, mounting hardware is not included here. This is a used optic in great condition, I'm selling it because the rifle it was on now has a scope with more magnification than this one offered. For anyone who is interested, the story on these scopes is that they were sold only at Cabelas, they were made in Japan, and by most accounts I have come across they appear to be re-branded Nikon scopes with a Blackhawk! tag slapped on them. It was a great scope for me, and it fits the look of the .308 upper very well. 

I should probably mention that yes, this is the rifle that will accept 5.56mm uppers; however, the special magazine well insert is an item that is sold separately from the rifle. I do not own the insert, and as such that part is not included in the deal. Sorry, as it turns out Colt makes 901 owners buy that little part on their own. 
I am willing to take off some of the price if anyone out there has a good condition German Mauser (K98) or Springfield XDm (9mm) to offer up.
Email me with any questions, thanks!"

This West German made Erma is the only one currently listed on Armslist Nationwide, and may very well be the Only One in the State of Colorado.
Read the information below to understand why this is such a Rare German Made Pistol. 

The Erma-Werke Luger Model KGP-69 is a Toggle Locked, Blowback Operated Pistol that is Chambered in .22 Cal.LR.  It has a Steel Receiver, Toggle Train and Barrel (1/2"" shorter than the P08). The lower Frame seems to be a steel alloy. The Steel Receiver and Barrel Assembly is Blued; (Bluish-Black). Lower Frame has a black coating. The grip panels are molded synthetic in a Simulated Wood Design..
The Company started After the Soviets burned the Lugar factory, using some of the same Tooling Equipment and Manpower. Known as Erfurter Maschinen und Werkzeugfabrik, the facility moved to Munich-Dachau Germany and became known as Erma-Werke.
Prior to WWII Erma produced the .22cal Conversion kit for the 9mm P08 Luger Pistol and was so successful that Erma decided to manufacture its own small target pistol. From the first .22 made in 1936 known as the Old Model; to 1969 and the first KGP-69 it has incorporated the improvements of its Predecessors including its pure blowback design.  Erma-Werke went out of business in 1997. 
I purchased this Firearm New in 1976 and have put less than 100 rounds down the pipe. Internally it’s a New Pistol. Always been a sweet gentle Plinker. Would look great with some Beeman Walnut  Grips. Comes with Owners Manual and takedown instructions as well as original factory Eight Round Magazine. Be the first one on the range to fire this Great Looking Luger at a Fraction of the cost of Ammo.   Make me an Offer or lets Trade"

Item Description
This bullpup pump-action shotgun has dual tube magazines that can hold a total of 14+1 rounds of ammunition(2-3/4""shells). The KSG can only set to feed from the right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a manual switch to select the other magazine. This may appear at first glance to be disadvantage but for many people who live in areas where shotgun magazine capacity is limited by law, this feature, or lack of feature as the case may be, could allow them to legally possess the KSG.

I would like to get a nice 22-250 for it. Prefer if it already had optics on it but for the right gun I would make an exception. The plan is for a straight across trade but as I said before for the right gun something can always be worked out. With everything that is on this gun I would put a trade value on it of around 1500. You have a list of everything that is on the gun feel free to price it all and add it up. I have more than that into the gun and do not need a gun worth 1500 to make the deal work. If you have a nice gun set up right I am willing to deal. If the post is up then the gun is still avaiable. Let me know what you have the worst I can say is no thanks."

This is the next evolution in buffer tube recoil systems. 

Don't settle for the typical and very crappy spring and buffer weight system. And don't even settle for the pneumatic AR-restor thingamajigger... Get this system! It truly rocks.. And it will make your DPMS .308/Armalite .308/POF .308/LWRCI .308/or whatever Ar-10/DPMS style .308 rifle you have work like a champ! Nothing beats this innovative new buffer tube system. It is the new standard for that least designed part of the AR system; the crappy tube and recoil part.

No more ""cheese grater and spoon"" sound while your gun cycles after each fired round. With this item, you get an amazing piece of engineering that's well made, operates silently, and adds to the higher overall quality level of your cherished .308 DPMS-style rifle.

I don't have a set price, so go ahead and make an offer. But remember, this item is sold out everywhere (online and offline) and the wait is atleast 90 days before JP Enterprises will start selling these again. So demand for this is very high.... I promise you, you'll be happy with this self-contained recoil system otherwise I will return your $$$ 150% guarantee within 30 days of purchase (new or used). 

If you wanna see what it looks like, hit me up or just do a simple internet search for ""JP Silent Captured Spring AR-10.""
