key lawmaker says legislation restricting assault weapons isn't likely to come up in the final days of the lame-duck session.
State Rep. Elaine Nekritz chairs a House judiciary committee that was scheduled Sunday to take up a bill limiting assault weapons. But the Northbrook Democrat says since the Senate didn't vote on similar legislation last week, there was no reason for the House to take it up.
She doesn't expect an assault weapons ban to come up before new lawmakers are sworn in on Wednesday.
Last week, a Senate committee approved curbs on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, but those bills didn't move to the floor.

I have a couple of nice Chinese SKS carbines for sale. One is a very early Chinese import like the ones that I have recently sold. It has thinning finish and the stock is dark, but a little better than some of them. This one has the spike bayonet, threaded barrel with chrome bore and milled trigger group.
These have been completely sold out for the last couple weeks, but I did manage to get this one from a fellow dealer in a trade.
Priced at $349.99. I will ship for an additional $25.00

I also have two very nice Chinese sks that were brought back from the Vietnam War. Both carbines have matching numbers and are in excellent condition. They both have chrome lined bores, milled trigger groups and threaded barrels. Metal is in good condition with no rust, pitting or damage. One carbine has an AK-47 bayonet in place of the blade bayonet that should be on it. It also comes with with a signed letter from the vet.  The other is a rare [0138] arsenal carbine and is in excellent condition.
These SKS's is priced at $599.99 each. I will ship for an additional $30.00 ea

 A lot of groups got together and got the word out and managed to kill off two attempts to bam all semi-automatic firearms in Illinois.

Two real good reasons this happened is Todd Vandermyde, the NRA lobbyist for Illinois was smack in their face during the Committee hearings and the good folks at Illinois Carry dot com.

www.IllinoisCarry.com

Illinois Carry was one of the plantiffs in the Shepard/Moore v. Madigan Court decision which resulted in the injunction against the State of Illinois to force a concealed carry law. Illinois Carry organized an immediate response to the attempt in the Senate and quickly redeployed to fight the attempt in the House. Our members are motivated,, energized and they have decided they are no longer going to take the abuse directed by the Chicago Machine.

The fight's over but believe me, it was just a skirmish.  The war rages on....

This is going to be a long drawn out war all Spring and we need as much help as possible.

Illinois Carry is an online forum with the sole intent to get concealed carry into law in Illinois and then to force the State to abandon the FOID and waiting period laws.  The forum at Illinois Carry is free and you will be joining thousands of other Illinois residents who are fighting to restore our rights guaranteed by the 2nd Amendment.

We have demonstrated how strong we are with only 3600 members but the real fight is coming.

Please consider joining where you will be able to interact directly with the folks that are getting the job done. Join now to helpo us make history, to participate in the fight against the Chicago Machine.

We have demonstrated that together, we are a force that can stand up to the Chicago politicians.

Pease join and help us finish the job.

1 - 1943 Izhevsk Mosin 91/30, this one was bubbed and needs some TLC. All of the parts are there and all are matching numbers. The only thing wrong with it is that the rear site is missing and the rear site base has been messed up, so it would take some clean up to get a site back on it but it is doable. I originally bought it as a great parts gun but was thinking about making a sporter out of it but just don't have the time.

I am looking for *military* surplus ammo between up to 50 cents per round (not looking for .50 cal or exotic sniper ammo).

Regarding .223 Remington and 5.56 NATO.... WalMart still sells Federal brass .223 Remington for 35 cents per round (100/$35) which works fine in most guns. WalMart still sells steel case .223 for 25 cents (20/$5) and I'm not interested in any steel case or overpriced commercial ammo. Forget about the crazy prices on .223/5.56.

Like people selling these AR and AK rifles that they are just trying to flip for profit. Check out the guns your looking at. Not always are they what the claim. Like how many times have they really shot them? Some claim they are great shooting for long distance and chances are they have not even fired them. Check to make sure the upper is authentic and not some cheap knock off. Check to make sure the upper and lower line up and are not sloppy. I know some of these turn and burn guys have bought items they are not aware of issues. Good luck to the suckers buying these rifles. If your not aware of what your buying then you deserve to get what you get.

Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun is the new product from Turkish company Akdal Arms. This weapon is intended for civilian and security use, and mimics the famous M16 rifle in its layout and placement of most controls. It is remarkably light for its caliber and size, because of extensive use of modern, high strength plastics.

Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight. Top of the upper receiver is shaped to provide integral Picatinny rail, which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight."

2003 wrx has built 2.5 block with wrx heads. I had plans for going big with this car but now its turned into my fuel saver car. Car right now get 27-30 mpg since it is on the stock wrx injectors and a break in tune at 5psi. The car moves decent but is not fast right now.

All this car will need it bigger injectors, Which I have just not installed.

the build has roughly 10k on it. I have driven the car from Atlanta to South Louisana several times now with out a single problem.

Bads: Power steering pump is going out, I will more and likely replace here soon.
Wipers sometimes like to go over the piller when in uses and driving.
Paint is decent allover except on the hood and bumper.

I loaded 1 of these twice the other two have never had a round in them. I will also throw in a nice $35 used black tri mag pouch that holds them great. $50 bucks each, $150 for all three and the mag pouch. I will only trade these as a package deal. I would like to trade these for a cheap gun that works. Eaa/Rossi .38, .357, 12/20 gauge shotgun, Mosin Nagant,  Mil surplus rifle or handgun, .22, Black powder gun. Ammo 762x39, 762x54r, 9mm, .40cal. I don't mind old guns but anything I trade for must be in working condition. I am not marking up these mags and playing the fear game. I am not paying these fear base prices either if you have ammo I paid $135 + tax at Tanner in Sept for 500rds of 762x39 and thats what I plan on tradeing for today. I am not going to screw you and I expect the same. Stop paying these fear based prices it will only hurt us all in the long run. Let your local gun store know that it is messed up for them to cash in on our fear. They are not paying one dime more for thier stuff and everything has gone up. Trade only, not for sale unless you want to pay $300 cash, If anyone going to get some crazy ass marked up price for these it's going to be me.

 All I hear from local gun store owners is how bad they need are help. Don't buy ammo from Wal-mart we can't compete with thier prices. Big box stores are killing the little guy. So I help, I buy ammo from the gun store and buy in bulk from the gun show and try to support the little guy. Now for the second time in four years These assholes are cashing in on are fear. Seems like everything jumped 30% when Oboma got into office and nothing happened and prices never went back down. Now it's happening again. Every chance they get these guy's screw us and I think it's pretty jack up of them. Wal-mart didn't double there prices, I think we should all stop playing along. If your gun store raises prices shop somewhere else, or better yet we should stop buying all together for 60-90 days a let them snap back to reality. I will not let them keep scewing me for the rest of my life and niether should you. What ever happens is going to happen if we let them set the bar this high by paying these crazy prices then we will be paying them for ever.

P.S. I will not trade these to anyone I think  is going to try and re-sell them for a profit, fuck that and shame on you."

It has Magpul lower, Magpul extendable stock, Magpul pistol grip, Magpul pop-up rear site, a Magpul hand guard plus front grip, and 2 Magpul magazines one with a window.  I have an after market BCM charging handle (which makes the charging handle wider) but I also still have the stock charging handle. It also has a Sight Mark red dot on it as well.  It has a police tactical case.  Also I have about 50 rounds of .223 varmit rounds. It has a blackhawk single point sling hook, and voodoo tactical single point bungee sling.  I have the orginal box and the tactical carbine dvds that came with it.

If you want to hunt or shoot skeet, buy a $100 barrel and drop it on the action and go get some ducks. Very versatile, home defense, ducks, skeet, whatever u want."

About the TAPCO Mags:
One of the finest AR-15 / M16 mags on the market today. Extremely reliable and durable and at a great price. By collecting input from military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters, TAPCO has designed a magazine that can be depended on from a trip to the firing range to deployment overseas. Molded of reinforced composite with aggressive horizontal ridges that provide increased gripping surface for insertion and extraction of the magazine in wet or muddy conditions. This also helps to eliminate feed lip separation. The anti tilt follower has been designed to allow more dirt and grime to pass than any other magazine on the market. This allows the magazine to keep feeding ammo, despite loose dirt or sand that may have entered the magazine. The spring is made using a 1770 Stainless steel wire, featuring a unique shape for smoother, quieter loading through all 30 rounds. It also reduces overall stress on the magazine body, preventing spine cracks. 30 Round capacity. Fits All AR15, M4, and M16 Variants. [b]Made in the U.S.A. with a lifetime warranty from TAPCO.[/b]"

This is a pre-'94 Springfield M1A National Match. 060xxx serial number range, all USGI internals (forged, no cast parts). As a NM model, it has the hooded sight, heavier barrel, and bedded stock. In overall excellent 97% condition. I bought this rifle from a well-known private party a few years ago, so I know it's history. It wasn't shot much by the previous owner, and I've put only 30 rounds through it myself. Comes with the bayonet, and six pre-ban USGI 20 round magazines.

Price is firm. Firm means if you contact me with a lower offer price than what I've listed, you will be ignored. Don't waste my time, and I won't waste yours.

Prefer FTF transactions as always, but will entertain out of state solicitations. I'm willing to drive a reasonable distance to facilitate a meeting halfway within WI. FTF will be cash only. Out of state buyers will need to use USPS money orders, as all other forms of payment will be delayed up to 10 business days to clear. No felons. I WILL ask to see your ID. If I feel your being shady with me, I'll run a backround check. NO PROHIBITED POSSESSORS. Out of state buyers WILL have the rifle shipped to an FFL dealer, no exceptions, you pay shipping."
