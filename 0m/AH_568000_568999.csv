64,http://www.armslist.com/posts/568064,For Sale:  M35 beretta,"westminster, Colorado, United States",$ 650,"Listed On: Monday, September 17, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"ww2 beretta model 35 or ""m35"" according to Whittington's records it was included in a delivery of 65,000 Beretta M1934/35 pistols delivered to the German Army Headquarters in Italy between Aug 1944 and Feb, 1945. Those serial # were 534000/599000.- ""mine has #'s in that range""
After the 8 September 1943 armistice between Italy and the Allies, the Germans saddled Beretta with three engineers from Germany. Moreover the factory was garrisoned by the SS... Weapons of that time, even the ones produced for the Germans, bore the punch mark 4UT
(Quarto Ufficio tecnico di Controllo Armi e Munizioni--4th Technnical Control Unit
an C. Still, in Axis Pistols, page 107, states,
""It is likely that almost all of the 4/UT, ...were used by the German Army"". He also includes two other variations in this statement, ""1944 dated and blank slide Model 1935"".
Ugo Menchini, in Pietro Beretta Le Automatiche, regarding an M1934, page 255, states,
""In late 1940 there appears an oval including the punch mark IVU. It refers to the 4th technical Control Unit of the FAG, where inspection was carried out.""
Note that, while they seem to represent the same inspectors, the ""IVU"" is not the same mark as the ""4UT"". The IVU would be found on the pre RSI model M1934, and the 4UT would be found on the RSI model M1935.
These are the reasons why I believe that it is likely that all of the 4UT Berettas were RSI pistols!! the IVU and the 4UT were the same office, but under Italian management the IVU, before the surrender of Italy, and German the 4UT, so after september, 8 1943.

TBL-37 TOP BREAK 37mm LAUNCHER with Poly Rifle Stock

The TBL-37 is a Single Action tactical launcher chambered in 37/38 mm and made to the highest standards of American workmanship. Constructed of 6061 aircraft grade aluminum and 4140 hardened steel, it is rugged while maintaining a reasonable weight.

Based on the proven design of the Viet Nam era M-79 grenade launcher, the TBL-37 has advanced it to new levels. Replacing the heavy wooden stocks with modern tactical black poly was the beginning. We added a full barrel length Picatinny rail on the top and a short rail under the muzzle. These allow the owner to interchange tactical accessories thus providing the ultimate in flexibility. We have also replaced the old flip up sight with a state of the art laser red/green dot sight as standard equipment. This can, of course, be interchanged with any other sight or scope that mounts on a Picatinny Rail.


Description and Features
In the standard configuration, the TBL-37 is equipped with a 12” barrel with a full length upper Picatinny Rail and a 1x Red and Green Dot Laser Sight. The underside of the barrel can be equipped with either a poly horizontal Foregrip and a 2” rail at the muzzle end or with a full length rail with a vertical Foregrip

The standard finish is matte black.
The TBL-37 is shipped in a heavy-duty cardboard box with a corrugated foam insert suitable for storage and transport."

The good: It has a solid motor, cuddy cabin interior is in good shape, all guages work, steering cables in great shape and work with no problem, it comes with three propellers (one of which is stainless steel), the gel coat still shines and in great shape, the hull is laid solid and thick, no nicks or patches, and the trailer has a Permanent Licsence plate.
The Bad: It has a out drive problem, and I haven't received the title back from the California DMV yet, I submitted the paperwork for a duplicate title a little over two weeks ago but am still waiting for it to return, the seats need recovering, and overall it needs some elbow grease to return it to a sharp looking boat.
I have owned if for over five years and it has been a fun family boat to fish or pull tubes and skiers with, but I have had my fun and am done with my boating.

The Bad: It has a out drive problem, and I haven't received the title back from the California DMV yet, I submitted the paperwork for a duplicate title a little over two weeks ago but am still waiting for it to return, the seats need recovering, and overall it needs some elbow grease to return it to a sharp looking boat.

TBL Info

TBL-37 TOP BREAK 37mm LAUNCHER 16” barrel Black poly rifle stock

The TBL-37 is a Single Action tactical launcher chambered in 37/38 mm and made to the highest standards of American workmanship. Constructed of 6061 aircraft grade aluminum and 4140 hardened steel, it is rugged while maintaining a reasonable weight.

Based on the proven design of the Viet Nam era M-79 grenade launcher, the TBL-37 has advanced it to new levels. Replacing the heavy wooden stocks with modern tactical black poly was the beginning. We added a full barrel length Picatinny rail on the top and a short rail under the muzzle. These allow the owner to interchange tactical accessories thus providing the ultimate in flexibility. We have also replaced the old flip up sight with a state of the art laser red/green dot sight as standard equipment. This can, of course, be interchanged with any other sight or scope that mounts on a Picatinny Rail.


Description and Features
In the standard configuration, the TBL-37 is equipped with a 12” barrel with a full length upper Picatinny Rail and a 1x Red and Green Dot Laser Sight. The underside of the barrel can be equipped with either a poly horizontal Foregrip and a 2” rail at the muzzle end or with a full length rail with a vertical Foregrip

The standard finish is matte black.
The TBL-37 is shipped in a heavy-duty cardboard box with a corrugated foam insert suitable for storage and transport."

Description:

The Remington Model 700 BDL is a bolt-action hunting rifle chambered in 12 different cartridges. The Model 700 was introduced by Remington in 1962 and has since been expanded to include more than 30 sub-models. The BDL is considered a deluxe model like the Model 700 CDL, but what makes the BDL different is its Monte Carlo stock with a raised cheek piece and the fact that it has sights.

Remington says the Model 700's action forms ""three rings of steel,"" meaning it uses a push-feed action where the bolt pushes the round towards the chamber and the extractor does not grab the rim of the cartridge until the bolt is completely forward and locked. It doesn't affect the smoothness of the action, but does cater to one's preference. Some prefer the push-feed action over a control-round feed action (which does the opposite). Also, according to Remington, the Model 700's receiver was milled from a single piece of steel, so it'll be more resistant to wear overtime than those not milled from a single piece of steel. A durable receiver is necessary especially when absorbing the force of the initial explosion that sets off heavier loads.

The Model 700 BDL features a carbon steel barrel with a high polish blue finish and the stock is American walnut with a glossy finish. It has a checkered fore-end and a padded butt. The BDL is equipped with Remington's patented X-Mark Pro adjustable trigger system, which has a pull weight of 3.5 pounds with two pounds of adjustment to suit the shooter's individual needs. What's unique about the X-Mark Pro trigger system is that it can be adjusted externally. The Model 700 BDL is also equipped with a hinged floor plate magazine, and an adjustable rear and hooded front sights."

I purchased this pistol about 6 months ago thinking it would be carried when I couldn't carry my M&P...I've found it tends to just hang out in the safe and I just dress around my M&P anyway

Up for grabs is a Smith and Wesson Bodyguard .380. It has an integral Insight laser and comes with 2 mags, the pictured Galco holster, 125 rounds of PMC brass cased FMJ ammo, and the original box and paperwork. I bought it brand new and put approximately 175 rounds through it. It functions flawlessly and has very dependable and accurate for being so tiny. It does have actual sights so it's much easier to aim than the Kel-Tecs and Rugers of similar size. This particular BG380 is a 2nd generation model, so it has the improved take down lever and laser activation buttons.

I'm not very fond of selling guns, so this one is up for trade. I would be interested in a fullsize M&P 9mm to compliment my compact model. I could also use a similarly valued AK47 or other semi-auto rifle.  I could also use a good revolver.

Long story short it cost me a nice ten point, I was able to tighten the cord that they put on and got a nice eight point with it, but I have confidence issues with it now even after having the cord replaced with the correct material.

FS2000 Tactical- .223/5.56 NATO 17.4"" Barrel, Black Finish, OD Green Polymer Stock, 30 Round

Chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO/223 Remington, the FN FS2000 Tactical is a civilian legal, semi-auto only variant of the proven F2000 selective-fire bullpup carbine that offers an integrated MIL-STD 1913 top mounting rail and emergency backup folding sights. The FS2000 carbine is gas-operated and uses a rotating bolt lockup for reliability and greater accuracy. Its 17.44"" cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel is fitted with a muzzle brake. Fired cases are ejected through a forward port away from the operator. The olive drab thumbhole design polymer stock is ambidextrous. Models with 10- or 30-round detachable box magazines (DBM) are available.

The FN FS2000 Tactical is a compact, reliable and accurate semi-auto only carbine with a 17.4"" civilian-legal barrel and is suitable for security, personal defense or competition. The gas-operated system fires a wide variety of 223 Rem. (5.56x45mm NATO) ammunition fed from standard M16-style magazines. Fired cases are ejected through a forward port away from the operator. 

The FS2000 sports both adjustable auxiliary iron sights and a top-mounted M1913 rail for mounting optical, electronic or laser sighting systems. An angled-face muzzle brake helps minimize recoil.

 It comes with the original box, paperwork, gun, and 1 clip.
 It functions flawlessly. NO FTF's or FTE's.
 The condition is 99%. Shiny black like NEW.
 I would have to say its had less tha 100 rounds through it cause the barrel is nice and shiny inside and the rifling grooves are still nice and deep.
 When it comes to old collectables this is the nicest TP22 I've seen on the net so far.

It has the original blade bayonet, original cleaning rod, original cleaning kit, 10 stripper clips, 200 rounds of Russian match grade 7.62x39 ammo, and case. The bore is bright and shiny with strong rifling. The bluing is original and none of the pats have been painted over later. The stock is its original dark hardwood finish and has the original serial number without being forced matched and having a bunch of XXXXX's over the old serial number. The stock has no cracks or deep gouges, just minor handling wear. The receiver cover is marked with the Tula star inside the star logo and has the date stamp of 1952r under the logo. I bought this gun over a year and a half ago and it has sat in the safe ever since. I have never fired it, and never planned to in order to keep it in the collectors condition it is currently in. I know what this gun is worth as would any serious SKS collector so please don't try to low ball me and compare this with the Yugo's and Norinco's out there.

The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2"" to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

901,http://www.armslist.com/posts/568901,For Sale:  NEW - Beretta Nano Gun Firearm,"SURPRISE, Phoenix, Arizona",$ 399,"Listed On: Wednesday, November 7, 2012",Handguns,Beretta USA,no type,no type,no type,"The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a fully removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
Advanced coating:
The Nano’s various finishes and coatings are designed to ensure your new carry piece not only wears well, but is always ready to perform. The slide and barrel are finished with black nitride, while the internal chassis is stainless steel and major springs are zinc plated.

Ambidextrous Mag Release:
Like most Beretta pistols, the Nano has a reversible magazine release button. All you need is a small punch and you can easy change it for right or left-handed use.

Interchangeable Sights:
The Nano’s sights are extremely user friendly. All you need is a 1.3 mm hex wrench and you can adjust, remove, and replace the Nano’s sights in seconds.

Modular Chassis
The stainless steel chassis of the Nano is the part that carries the serial number. The technopolymer grip frame can be easily removed for cleaning or to be replaced by a different grip frame.

Simple Disassembly
Easy to clean, easy to use. All you need to do is press the Striker Deactivator, turn the Disassembly Cam ¼ turn counterclockwise, and the slide pops right off. The recoil spring is captured so it won’t fly away.

Snag Free Design
The Nano primary mission is concealed carry. It’s smooth, snag free profile makes it easy to holster, easy to carry and easy to draw. No awkward levers or switches to get caught or hung up on.

Stainless Magazine:
Designed for the rigors of concealed carry, the Nano's magazine and follower are constructed entirely of polished stainless steel. The polymer floorplate completely covers the bottom of the Nano's gripframe to reduce the introduction of foreign contaminants and create a uniform grip.
Striker Deactivator
Don’t like pulling the trigger to disassemble your handgun? Neither do we. Simply press the Striker Deactivator with a small punch or ball point pen and you can safely deactivate the striker system. It works a lot like the decocker on our military’s M9 pistol.

Beretta PX4 Storm Full Size

Low barrel axis position

Thanks to the design of the direct barrel-slide locking system, the low barrel axis reduces felt recoil and minimizes muzzle rise.

Newly designed slide

The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in moist conditions.

3-Dot Sight System

Features a white '3-dot' sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

Simple Field Stripping

Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.

External Hammer Design

A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

Ambidextrous Safety (Type F)

The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it's either positively ""on"" or ""off"". The safety lever also functions as the pistol's decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever.) Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop

Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block

The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the bloack is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer

No Glare Finish

Beretta's exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish

Slide

The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions

Accessory Rail

The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapic attachment of tacitcal lights and laser aiming devices

Reversible Magazine Release

Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual's hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use

Individual Size Grips

Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large back-straps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.

Magazine

High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds (1 round for .45 Auto caliber).

• Manufacturer: Beretta

Year:  The label is XXIV (Beretta’s (Italy) code for 1968)

However... the barrels are not marked. The barrels are labeled Skeet 1 and Skeet 2, but I believe this is in reference to the barrel sequence and not indication of the choke.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"
