Original owner. 
I had the choice of the Benelli or Fabarm that where sitting next to each other at the gun store and after picking up this Fabarm shotgun, I never once even thought about the Benelli after that. 
This shotgun is so smooth it feels like it's on ball bearing rails when loading shells into the chamber. Hard to find and is one of the best shotguns in the world. 
No longer Imported and one of the hardest to find shotguns out there. Want a Shotgun of pure quality and something that a million other people don't have? This is what you want and no disappointments of any kind except for not being able to find accessories for it since nothing is being imported into the United States. But what else do you need? I already added the 2 shot extension and everything else is there for mounting Red dot sights or add another picatinny rail and add a flashlight or laser. 

When it comes to reliability and tactical flexibility, nothing matches the FABARM FP6 Series shotguns. Security professionals agree that a pump-action shotgun is still the best choice for a defensive shotgun. FABARM FP Series shotguns are built to take the toughest abuse confronting today’s law enforcement and security users.

FABARM pump-action shotguns use the same advanced design and manufacturing techniques found on their premium arms. Twin action bars, deep drilled TriBore™ barrels, durable sandblasted anodized finish, as well as interchangeable chokes, make the FP6 one of the strongest and most tactically adaptable pump-action security and utility shotguns available. The ability to mount accessory Picatinny rails on the extended forearm, combined with the rail mount built onto the receiver of many of the FP6 models further enhances the tactical utility of this shotgun.

Features:
• Tribore™ chrome lined barrel with heat shield 
• free carrier for quick, smooth reloading 
• extended forearm has hard points for mounting accessories 
• threaded outer barrel for chokes 
• Ergal 55 alloy receiver 
• can use a variety of accessories, including folding stocks, pistol grip stocks, compact hand grip, and magazine extension 
• twin forged action bars for smooth reliable operation 
• 3"" chamber 
• large safety button 
• choice of blade sight or Picatinny rail 
• lifetime warranty (not sure of warranty is transferable to a different owner)"

Never a hiccup with this gun. I didn't like the factory plastic trigger, so this one has been upgraded with a Northwoods trigger. It feels much better. Bought this as a carry gun, but it never made it into the rotation, so its taking up room now. 

I have taken this out 3 times, its not a range gun as its very light for a 9mm and therefore has a less than pleasant recoil. So it has not been shot much. I would estimate 3 boxes, or 4 at most.

Unmolested but ready to be bubba - ized , tacti -cooled, or just shoot the heck out of it like it was designed for. Has the grenade launcher still attached as well as the bayonet. NO, I have NO grenades to include with this gun, let alone anything for you to stick the bayonet into, LOL . I may be talked into including a box or two of ammo, though. BONUS BONUS BONUS I also found a 30 round HI CAP mag that I will include. That will get you started on your 922r compliant conversion for the ultimate tactical SKS .

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are ""mentally challenged"" shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha"

Unmolested but ready to be bubba-ized , tacti-cooled, or just shoot the heck out of it like it was designed for. Has the grenade launcher still attached as well as the bayonet. NO, I have NO grenades to include with this gun, let alone anything for you to stick the bayonet into, LOL . I may be talked into including a box or two of ammo, though. BONUS BONUS BONUS I also found a 30 round HI CAP mag that I will include. That will get you started on your 922r compliant conversion for the ultimate tactical SKS .

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are ""mentally challenged"" and shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha"

1946 dated, all numbers match, including magazine floorplate.
Bluing is in excellent condition, stock is very nice with even finish and no cracks.

Bore is very good, rifling is strong, fairly shiny bore with minimal muzzle wear. Passes ""bullet test"" easily.

Trigger is probably one of the best i have encountered on a mosin. Very light with very little creep or slop. 

This rifle shoots very very well. Very accurate for a n old military carbine.
Comes with sling, ammo pouches, oil can, cleaning kit and tools.

Im inpterested in trading for an 8mm mauser carbine (M48), Enfield or maybe a nice arisaka.
Will listen to all trade offers, though. Just no junk, please. Or black powder.

Description from Vltor: The MUR is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines.  The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall making the MUR upper receiver a more rigid platform. A more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability while extending the life of interfacing components such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly.
The main benefit of the MUR is it's dimensionally correct. Unfortunately, with the current war effort, a number of AR suppliers are rushing through production, bypassing critical dimensions which will either make or break the reliability and accuracy of the weapon. With the existence of the MUR, you'll receive the best and highest quality upper receiver available on the market today."

This 3rd generation Glock 26 was fired 10 times by a beautiful young woman.  It comes with 100 rounds of Remington Golden Saber HPJ.  Also included is all original paperwork, cleaning brush and rod, silly lock (not pictured), 2x10 Round Mags, Glock Mag Loader and a Blackhawk holster which fits perfectly.   

The MSRP of a Glock 26 is roughly $550.  Can anyone find a new one?  I can't.

If you could find a shop with one in stock it would be almost $600 with tax.  I am also including $60 worth of ammo, and a $35 holster.   

We need to meet at a gun range or other gun friendly locale.  I require a Washington Drivers License and for you to sign a bill of sale.

Thank you."
