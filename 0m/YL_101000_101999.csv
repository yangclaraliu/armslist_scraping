Also I have a unique ""one of a kind"" lightly fished 9ft 5wt 7 piece Rain Forest travel rod with a custom carbon fiber foam core handle. I built an additional butt/handle section, then eliminated one of the lower sections resulting in a 7.5ft 3-4wt 5 piece rod. I built this for myself as a lark but have never cast it (and probably never will). I did send it to Colorado with a friend, who knows his stuff, he said 9ft 5wt configuration  performed extremely well up to 60 ft where it started to loose it. I can send pictures if you email a request.

The Mark 4® 1-3x14mm CQ/T® is a revolutionary optical sight for firearms such as the AR-15 and SCAR combining the strengths of a red dot sight and the flexibility of a variable power riflescope. Just as important, the reticle is always visible, with or without batteries, so you’re always prepared.

Description
- Eleven reticle illumination settings to match any light conditions.
- Common AA batteries power the CQ/T for more than 600 hours at medium setting.
- The true 1x setting allows you to shoot with both eyes for fast target acquisition and reactive shooting.
- 2x or 3x settings give you the power to accurately engage targets at medium ranges.
- The integrated MIL-STD-1913 rail mount cross slots allow you to easily attach a variety of accessories to your CQ/T.
- The reticle is illuminated in amber. When turned off, or without batteries, it remains visible, reverting to black.
- Flip-open lens covers are standard issue with the CQ/T.
- Windage and elevation dials in ½-MOA coin-click adjustments.
- Extremely rugged and 100 percent waterproof.
- Extra Flat top mounting bracket included.
- Extra dial covers included.
- Missing instruction booklet / warranty card is present and not filled out.

Retail these go for 1300 minimum (pre-shipping) and that is with the TA-51 mount which admittedly leaves much to be desired, hence I have replaced it with a higher end ADM (American Defense) quick-release mount which uninstalls with the throw of a single lever, and will retain its zero when it is reattached.  It pains me to sell this optic but alas it is time to move onto a new project, and it has always been a safe queen and has literally seen one magazine of use.  Its lack of use is the only reason for a sale as it has been one of the best optics I have ever owned.  Here is the official sales pitch:

""The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gun sight (ACOG) designed for the M16M4 weapon system (14.5 barrel). It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corp, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.""

Henry AR-7 model Survival rifle in 22 long rifle.  Includes original box and paper work.  I have had it for about 6-7 years and probably put over a 1000 rounds thru it.  It likes the Winchester (333 or 555) and Federal (375 or 550) cheap round nose bulk ammo.  It does not like most other 22 ammo, especially the Remington cheap green box stuff.  Includes two 8-round magazines – both run equally well.  Comes completely apart and stores in stock.  This is the 3rd generation of this rifle, first made by Armalite as an Air Force survival rifle, then Charter Arms, now Henry.  This one has been completely taken apart, cleaned, honed, broken in and runs pretty well.  Keep it clean and lubed with the ammo above and it will operate with <2% failure rate (until the weather drops below about 45°F) – which is excellent for these novelty type guns.  It is a fun gun to shoot, very light weight, and rather accurate with the peep sight.  This one is in very good shape.  All black version.

This knife was made to commemorate the wedding of 19-year-old Prince Karam Singh, heir to the Maharaja of Kashmir and 16-year-old Princess Yashorajya Lakshmi, the granddaughter of the hereditary Premier of Nepal on April 22nd, 1950. 
This is a very comfortable knife to hold (considering it is a knuckle knife). The lobe rests in the palm of the hand to absorb shock and to aid holding it when slippery from use. It is a very effective design. The blade is sharp on both sides. It measures 11-1/4 inches long overall and intended to be used with either bare hand or gloved fingers. 
It has many markings on the handle. One one side, there is the JODHPUR CITY VOLUNTEER CORPS unit name and coat of arms. There is provision for a number, however this one is not numbered. The other side of the handle has AUSPICIOUS WEDDING PRINCESS JODHPUR APRIL 22nd 1950. The knife is used, however in overall near-excellent condition. The original scabbard is included. Serious inquiries only, please. Email with questions or offers. 
This is a very rare knife and would make a great addition to any serious collection.

The “XCS” stands for “Extreme Conditions Shotgun”, and means that the exterior of the gun is coated with Remington’s proprietary Black TriNyte corrosion resistant coating. Interior parts are coated with electroless nickel, and the trigger group is plated. In short, this shotgun is designed to handle conditions that would rust and corrode other shotguns, and that is why it costs about twice as much as other shotguns in the Remington 870 family. Also included with the Remington 870 XCS Marine Magnum model are a limbsaver recoil reducing pad, and a speed feeder synthetic stock which stores 4 additional shells. The cylinder bore barrel is 18? long. if you want a bad ass shotgun this is it, its like new just been sitting in the gun safe since bought, only shot it a few times,but new projects require money . this shotgun from what i under stand has been discontinued so good luck trying to find one, i paid 650.00 new  i have the box and sling that came with it and all paper work...google it and read reviews and see if you can find one at all much less cheaper.

I got it a few months ago and after waiting for it to come in, I can't get it anymore. It's still at my dealer on a form 3 ready to get transferred.

Heres the information from Silencerco's website.

With the modern combat handgun in mind, Silencerco set out to create a silencer that performs well and looks like it belongs—the best possible marriage between host weapon and silencer. Silencerco went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&W, and 45ACP.
Although round silencers are very effective for many applications, for a centerfire handgun round it has its limits. To obtain the most suppression, silencers must have as much internal volume as possible; but for a round tubular silencer, the only way to acquire more internal volume is by increasing the overall diameter and/or length. Increasing a tube’s diameter will obscure the site picture of the host gun and inhibit the possibility of holstering a weapon with the silencer still attached to the host gun.
The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun’s sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols. This feature allows the host weapon to be holstered with many popular open bottom holster designs with Osprey attached. The Osprey contains approximately 30% more internal volume than a traditional round tube silencer at the same length, but does so without obscuring the shooter’s sight picture or adding excessive width and length.
OTHER BENEFITS
Besides having the best suppression levels available for centerfire handguns, the Osprey silencer family has other benefits and features that are unique to the industry.
MOUNTING SYSTEM
Because of its eccentric design, the Osprey must have a way to index to the host gun. Silencerco designed the patent pending cam lever locking system that allows the shooter to time the silencer to any host pistol. To mount, simply thread the Osprey on the muzzle just as you would a traditional silencer with the cam lever in the locked position. When the Osprey shoulders, hand tighten to ensure a tight fit then release the cam lever and rotate the Osprey to the proper orientation. Finally, move the cam lever back to the locked position. The Osprey will return to this index point for subsequent mountings until you change the host pistol or remove the piston assembly for cleaning.
BOOSTER AND ACCESSORIES
Working in harmony with the patent pending cam lever locking system, the Osprey has a unique booster, or Nielsen device, that allows flawless cycling with all relevant semi-automatic handguns. All of the boosters are the same dimensions on all three Osprey calibers, which means you can interchange the piston portion for different thread specs and subcalibers. For example, you can shoot a 9mm or .40 S&W through a 45Osprey or a 9mm through a 40Osprey. Silencerco also offers a fixed barrel spacer for use on subguns/pistol caliber carbines and host weapons that have fixed barrels.
LIGHTWEIGHT AND COMPACT
The Osprey is very lightweight and does not greatly affect the balance of the host pistol. The 45Osprey and 40Osprey weigh 11 ounces, and the 9 mm Osprey weighs 9.84 ounces. Many people feel Osprey actually improves the balance of their host firearm. The Osprey also is a handy 8 inches long in the 45Osprey and 40Osprey models and only 7 inches long in 9mm. This design makes them “short” for their performance level."
