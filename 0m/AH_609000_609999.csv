WWW.PCShooting.com

We have 9 spots left in our upcoming North Carolina CCH / CCW Concealed Pistol Training class Sunday Oct 21, 2012.

The course is instructed by seasoned firearms instructor, Roger Pettit.
Roger is fully licensed and fully insured (Lloyd's of London) and we hold the class on an actual gun range. He has a great sense of humor and has great stories being he's an ex-marine, bounty hunter, and has worked with multiple military contractors. The cost of the class is $85 a person OR $150 ($75 each) if you bring along a friend. This price is ALL INCLUSIVE meaning this price includes course work, red book, certificate, drinks and pizza for lunch, and Roger even supplies guns and ammo if you choose not to bring your own!!! No tricks or gimmicks here! If you don't have experience, no worries! Roger will get you up to pace during the class. If you've done any research on CCH you know $85 is CHEAP and alternatives NEVER include this much. The classes are small (10-20) and Roger has years of experience teaching them in multiple states. If interested let me know and check out the website info: www.PCShooting.com.

The next class is Oct 21. Location is 20 minutes outside Cary, NC down US-1 at LCWC.

Email if interested as seats are limited. Email can be found on our listed website.

Adding an enlarged bolt knob to a rifle is a popular upgrade that gives a better grip when operating the bolt under any conditions. Previously, if you wanted that improved bolt handling you would have to buy a knob and send your bolt off to a gunsmith who would cut and thread your bolt handle and install your new knob.

Unlike most other manufacturers, Ruger's 10mm is not a semiautomatic pistol. The Ruger Blackhawk ""Buckeye"" Convertible is a single-action revolver. Like all Ruger Blackhawks, this 10mm Auto version is strong and ultra-reliable. As this particular Blackhawk is a ""Convertible"" model it comes with a second cylinder in a different caliber. Both the 10mm Auto and the .38-40 Winchester use .400"" caliber projectiles and so either caliber can be fired down the Blackhawk's barrel by simply switching cylinders.

As already mentioned, Ruger's 10mm came in the form of it's popular single-action Blackhawk revolver. This was a run of 5,000 guns for Buckeye Sports Supply, and truth be told it wasn't actually a dedicated 10mm, but rather a dual-cylinder convertible with one cylinder in 10mm Auto and the other in .38-40 Winchester. Has the Buckeye flower rollstamp stamped on the topstrap.

It comes with all factory accessories (including 3 17rd mags, mag loader, lock, factory box, and literature).

The only modification I've made to the 92A1 is replacing the plastic stock grip panels with Beretta walnut panels. I still have the original panels, but if you want the walnut ones too we can work something out. I'm not against including them, but it would have to be discussed as part of the trade.

Not too interested in selling at this point. I can trade up or down, it just depends on what's offered. Worst I can say is I'm not interested...however, please no junk, compact handguns only, nothing abused. I'm not a firearms expert in anyway, but it's pretty easy to look up current market prices for used guns. Don't waste my time making me an offer that obviously gives me the short end of the stick.

From Manufacturer: ""The SAW-MAG offers for the first time a reliable and efficient 150 rd magazine for the .223/5.56mm rifle. Designed to fit NATO standard (STANAG-4179) rifles, the SAW-MAG quickly converts a rifleman with a standard M4 into automatic support personnel. The flexibility of such force multiplication makes the SAW-MAG the most dominant accessory for the M4/M16/M27/HK416 family of weapons. The SAW-MAG was designed to have the lowest operating drag due to friction. The ammunition is contained individually inside the drums on sprockets, each cartridge gets its own separate space, the ammunition is picked off the sprockets when they spin, not a typical high friction convergence found on cheaper designs. This is why our system does not require graphite lubrication to work. Instead of funnelling the ammunition, the SAW-MAG uses a proprietary design that allows the ammunition to always be in a singular stream which results in a very low friction operation. Caliber-5.56mm/.223 Weight 3.9 lbs (SAW-MAG loaded HK416 =16lbs (M249 Unloaded 17lbs) Capacity-150 Rounds Color-Black."""

This Burnside Carbine is very reasonable and you won't see many in this price range. Price is firm. Please no ridiculous offers. Price is firm.

1. Defensive Shooting / Rapid Engagement

2. Defensive Handgun Skills

3. Firearms and the Law: Possession, Ownership, and the Use of Deadly Force

4. Strategies for Preventing a Home Invasion 

5. Responding to a Violent Confrontation

6. Selecting a Handgun for Personal Defense

7. Three hours of Range Shooting

8. Course Review and Examination

Students will receive the NRA Guide to the Basics of Personal Protection in the Home handbook (a $20 value included in the price) and intensive lessons on defensive shooting, issues of self-defense, and other strategies for protecting the home and family.

Students will also receive feedback on their shooting exercises, and a National Rifle Association (NRA) certificate upon successful completion of this course. Not only are shooting standards fired during the practical exercises, but a written exam will be given at the end of the course.
