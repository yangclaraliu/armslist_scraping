FFLs or Police Departments, however, may take any number of very similar additional rifles at the same per-gun price and with no additional shipping charges. This pristine Yugoslavian Military rifle has been warehoused in an armory in what is now the Republic of Montenegro, a former Yugoslav State, since it was manufactured, in 1975. We do not believe it was ever issued. This rifle’s quality is on a par with the Russian SKS’s. External surface has strong original bluing throughout with a nice purplish hue to it, and the buttstock is quite nice, every bit as good as the Russian SKS’s that trickled in 10 to 15 years ago; in fact, this rifle was made on Russian milling equipment. All the serial numbers match: on the receiver, on the receiver cover, on the magazine housing, and even on the stock cartouches. Surface detractions are negligible, principally light occasional scouring to the wood surfaces. We rate this rifle as Excellent and Unissued, 90 percent vicinity by our estimate.  Photos, at any rate, should suffice for prospective owners to check our finish grading. We have removed the grease from the outside surfaces, and from the bore, magazine, and gas tube. Mechanism still is well lubricated inside with grease, but that grease is the reason this rifle survived all these years in such fine condition. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent. From its letter L Serial number prefix, it was manufactured in 1975. Its only alien markings are on the left side of the receiver, PWA Importer mark neatly and inconspicuously stamped.  Rifled portion of the barrel is about 20 inches, with 24 inch overall length including the muzzle brake. Bayonet is blade type with chrome plating, identical to the Russians. This is a very tough made rifle; and it will certainly digest any steel case ammunition on the market nowadays. Weight empty is a well balanced 9 3/4 pounds, and their low recoil makes them one of the most pleasant handling hunting rifles on the market today. All the aftermarket accessories for SKSs will fit this one, too. While this rifle is eligible for transfer to Federally Licensed Collectors, it is not eligible for transfer to civilians in California, C&R Licensed or not; on account of the grenade launcher apparatus at the muzzle. We’re offering the very nice 59/66 SKS Rifle in the photos or one of its identical mates	for only	$ 339.00.	 Not transferable to civilians in California or any other jurisdiction where it is prohibited or restricted. The obsolete grenade launcher on the barrel muzzle is a problem under California Law. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $20 flat fee lower 48 states; $50 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, UPS Ground with full insurance coverage.

No reason in particular, just looking to try something new. It is a amazing pistol that is dead reliable, accurate, and best of all doesn't have the stupid new lock S&W puts in their revolvers now. It has a concealed hammer for maximum concealment and ease of draw. I have installed a front night sight on it that still has some juice but is getting a little dim. Also installed some brand new Pachmayr Gripper grips on it but I have the originals as well. I will throw in a box of factory .357 soft tips as well. I am looking for a trade around the same price or cash. I am open to trade offers but am not looking for anything of poor manufacture(hi-point, even taurus etc.) exotic, beat up, or of small caliber (e.g. .380, .32, .22 etc.). Mainly looking for semi-auto pistols or revolvers. Prefer FTF in CO SPRNGS, must be able to legally own a handgun in Colorado.

Unfortunately, I have (technical term here) screwed up recently and allowed the jig used to locate the slot to go out of adjustment.

NOTE, added 10/14 afternoon: ALL 30-round mags have been sold. There are only five 20-round mags remaining.

These brand new mags will not work in a 180, but they will work as well in an AR-15 type gun as any other new Brownell's mags, which is to say, perfectly.

I normally sell these mags for $35 each, postpaid, but since sales are closed to my primary customer (AR-180 owners), I would just like to recoup some of my investment, as opposed to setting them in a corner and watching them collect dust. So here's the bottom line: $10 each (this is below wholesale cost)."

Here is a brief description of the weapon;
The P-232 is a simple blowback operated, hammer fired pistol, with double action trigger and a manual decocker lever mounted on the left side of the frame, behind the trigger. P-232  features an automated firing pin safety. The pistol lacks a slide stop. The pistol can be found in standard form, with steel slide and aluminium alloy frame and blue finish, or in SL versions, with both slide and frame made from stainless steel. Latter models are slightly heavier and wear a polished steel finish. P-232 featured drift-ajustable rear sights, dovetailed into the slide. Feed is from single stack magazines for 7 9mm or 8 7.65mm rounds. It should be noted that the P-232 features a magazine catch, located at the heel of the grip.

Both P-230 and P-232 are high quality, durable and reliable guns, as every other pistol, produced by the famous Swiss-German alliance. These guns are well suited for personal defence, concealed carry and as a backup guns, offering good accuracy and mild recoil."

When you see the Gettysburg 1863 Revolver, designed after the classic Colt Model 1860 Army Revolver, you’ll know why it earned the respect of soldiers on both sides of that conflict in July, 1863. 

Feeling its solid weight in your palm, you’ll begin to understand the confidence of the Confederates who carried it up the slope of Cemetery Ridge, into the heart of the Union defenses. 

Listening to the smooth click of the hammer, you can also visualize the Union officers taking aim to protect that three-mile-long defensive line, desperately trying to hold the Union together. If this battle was lost, all could be lost, and they knew it. 

Studying the detailed, 24-karat gold scenes on the cylinder, you can feel the agony of these two seasoned and capable armies in a bloody battle to decide the future of our nation. 

Like anyone who has thrilled to the story of America’s Civil War, I know that accounts of the Battle of Gettysburg inspire powerful images and emotions to this day. Still, no book or movie can bring these emotions to life as powerfully as just holding the Gettysburg 1863 Revolver."

The Barong is one of the classic short swords used by the Filipino warriors who prized it for its ability to sever an arm or leg with a single blow! While widely known throughout south east Asia, it is particularly popular to this day with the Moros of Sulu, Mindanao, and North Borneo. 

Barongs feature distinctive leaf shaped blades that are quite heavy and measure up to 18"" long by 3"" wide. They often come with elaborate handles which anchor the heavy sword in the hand and help to resist centrifugal forces when making a hard chopping or slashing stroke. 

The mirror polished blade of the Moro Barong is approximately 18"" long by 23/4"" wide and 1/4"" thick at the spine. For maximum strength and effectiveness in battle, it is forged from 1055 Carbon spring tempered steel and distal tapered to assure perfect balance. Each blade comes fully sharpened. 

The classically shaped, down-turned handle is made from exotic Rosewood, specially selected to match the scabbard in both grain and color.

Sharp as Saladin’s legendary blade, the sleek, classically curved Cold Steel® Scimitar® places the power of the sword in your pocket.
Our craftsmen have captured the timeless quality of superior cutlery and united it with the finest in modern materials. The result is a dazzling, high impact folding linerlock® like no other knife available.
The Scimitar® blade is hollow ground stainless steel, honed to razor sharpness and features the famous curve of its ancient namesake. Painstakingly designed to facilitate the draw cut, the most effective cutting stroke known to man, the blade also features a needle sharp point which pierces at the slightest touch.

Superior engineering combines traditional appeal with the latest Western technology in the contoured Zytel® and steel frame handle designed exclusively by Lynn Thompson for the Cold Steel® Scimitar.® The pistol grip handle facilitates all types of forward grips, including the saber, quarter saber and hammer grips. Its sleek curves, finger grooves and checkering settle naturally and securely into the hand, maximizing the user’s ability to control both the edge and the point. Reverse or palm reinforced grips are mastered with ease, making the pistol grip shape of the Cold Steel® Scimitar® handle one of the most versatile and user-friendly ever devised. A hard-hitting ball shaped pommel contributes to the Scimitar’s® rock steady grip and versatility. The pommel can be used as a striking tool to deliver less than lethal blows to nerve centers and soft targets. It can also serve as a secondary grasping point, allowing the user to extend his reach by as much as three inches.

Lock strength is critical in a high performance knife, and the Scimitar® is head and shoulders above the rest. We have equipped the Scimitar® with a state-of-the-art titanium linerlock® for maximum strength and durability. The strength of titanium is peerless in the cutlery industry, and tests on this mechanism resulted in it holding 100 pounds without collapsing, far exceeding the load-bearing ability of our competitors.

A pocket clip makes it a snap to carry and access quick as a flash. Feel the extraordinary power of history’s most famous sword design in a folding knife of unequaled versatility- and put it in your pocket - with Cold Steel's Scimitar®.

The M&P Series Lasergrips for S&W pistols are interchangeable between different calibers of the M&P full size pistol and feature a hard polymer surface that's most closely matches the Medium/Large stock Smith & Wesson grip inserts. These lasergrips fit the M&P pistol just like the stock grips while offering a compact laser diode housing that's well suited to most carry and duty holsters. They also feature a rear-activation switch that's part of your natural grip so there's no fumbling to activate the laser with your trigger finger."

The Taurus PT 740 Slim is a semi-automatic small-frame pistol chambered for .40 S&W. The 740 Slim has been praised for its smooth cycling and comfortably compact design by many reviewers. Named “Slim” because it is 1.04"" wide—that’s about 0.1"" to 0.2"" smaller than most other small-frame pistols. However, one design feature it could not escape, like most sub-compacts, is a short grip, so pinkies will hang, but it has a lot of other shooter-friendly features. 

Features include three-dot sights that are adjustable for elevation and wind. Several safeties including a trigger safety that prevents the firing pin from punching forward unless the trigger is actually pulled, so if it’s dropped no accidental discharge. A safety switch, just in case, and a lock safety that renders it functionless with a turn of a key. A thumb and index finger groove make for an interesting ergonomic design. There is a thumb indent for the action-hand’s grip and a finger groove along the frame just below the slide to place the passive hand’s index finger"

Barrel
Free-floating cold-hammer forged precision barrel is thread-fastened rigidly to the receiver for safety and accuracy.

Stock
The Tikka T3 Lite has an all-black stock. The light but sturdy T3 TrueBody fiber glass reinforced polymer stock is pure Sako innovation. The straight stock combines high performance with light weight ease. Positive checkering provides for comfort and firm grip in all weather conditions. Sling swivels as standard.

industry benchmark for out-of-the-box accuracy. Capitalizing on Sako’s legendary gun making traditions, Tikka combines modern technology with time-honored craftsmanship to meet the requirements of modern hunters."""

Excellent condition. Someone put on a rubber buttpad on it at some time in it's past but original buttplate contour appears to be intact- could be put back to stock configuration with an $8 plate from Numrich. 

FR-8 rifles were developed during late 1950s in Spain during their transition from military bolt action rifles to new, select-fire CETME Mod.58 assault rifles, chambered for then-new 7.62x51 NATO ammunition. The FR letters stand for ""Fusil Refromando"", and both FR-7 and FR-8 rifles are conversions of the earlier Mauser type bolt action rifles, which were in abundance at the time because of adoption of new, more effective guns.
The FR-8 rifles were converted from Spanish Model 1943 rifles, which are based on Model 1898 Mauser action, also known as ""Large ring"" Mauser action. Conversions included new barrels, inserted spacers in magazines (to accommodate shorter rounds), shortened forends and new iron sights. 
The FR-8 rifle is a manually operated bolt action rifle. It employs Mauser type rotary bolt with two frontal locking lugs and single rear lug (FR-7 bolt has no rear safety lug), and Mauser-type extractor which provides controlled feed. Cartridges are fed from integral box magazine with 5-round capacity, which can be loaded using stripper clips or loose rounds. Barrel is equipped with muzzle brake / flash hider, which also can be used to launch NATO-standard rifle grenades. The short tube, located below the barrel, has mostly cosmetic purpose, as it serves to provide bayonet mount interface. Its inner space also can be used to store front sight adjustment tool or small cleaning kit. The iron sights consist of adjustable, hooded front sight and combination aperture/V-notch rear sight, which is made in the form of rotating disc. The rear sight disc has V-notch for 100 meters range and three apertures for 200, 300 and 400 meters range.
Bayonets and slings from CETME's will work with this rifle.

Bore is excellent and parkerizing is in good shape. I've seen several in the past with no finish left on the bolt handle, but it looks like this one hasn't been used very much. These rifles are somewhat rare and have just about doubled in value in the past couple years, and will probably continue to go up.

I'd be willing to take partial or whole trades if you have something interesting. Not looking for hunting rifles.
The price includes an FFL transfer with my local FFL if you want one, otherwise buyer must be willing to sign a receipt.
Any questions, just ask."

It was originally designed by the Swedes and produced as the AG-42 Ljungman for the Swedish Army. The tooling and design were later sold to the United Arab Republic (Egypt), and the Hakim was produced there during the 1950's and 60's. The adjustable gas operated system is very simple and is not unlike the U.S. M16 rifle.

The Hakim features the proven and very strong tipping bolt system like the FN49, Russian SKS and French MAS56 rifles. Available in 8 mm Mauser caliber, 192 grain (12 g) bullet only, it is a finely machined (expensive to produce), sturdy semi-automatic rifle of the highest quality. The Hakim has a removable 10 round magazine intended to be reloaded with 5 round stripper clips (8 mm Mauser)."
