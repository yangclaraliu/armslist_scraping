Barrel is cryo treated for better patterning, and it also has the nice accu-stock on it for reducing recoil, and the gun comes with two cryo-chokes I have purchased (ic, mod) and the wrench to swap them. I have over $600 in this gun alone and that does not include the $50 each choke cost me and the wrench as well and I have only taken it out a couple times so I believe $550 is more then fair but as it is OBO feel free to shoot me your counter-offer, it has been shot so little that it still looks like your looking down a mirror when you look down the barrel and the gun has zero issues, it functions perfect and is far superior to any other pump I have ever used. I will also include a couple boxes of 3.5"" magnum shells as well which will save you around $50 (mixed blindside and remington hyper-steel) Thanks for looking. If you are serious about it, please make me an offer on it, I will consider any real and fair offer in hopes of making a deal easy,  possibly consider partial trade for other firearm, but I do need a little cash out of the deal.

The .22 TCM is basically a 9mm casing with a .223 rifle projectile and it produces an amazing 2200 FPS out of a 5"" 1911 barrel and this in turn makes it more powerful than a .45 ACP but with the kick of a .22. This is just an amazing little cartridge and only about 2500 have been imported thus far and they are sold out everywhere and with new gun legislation rearing it ugly head its a good chance there may not be anymore imported. Also included will be a 9mm barrel and spring which can be switched out in a matter of seconds for a reliable double stack 9mm 1911. Included is one 18 round magazine, fitted pistol case, all paperwork as new and as mentioned the 9mm barrel and spring. Pistol is like new with only 100 rounds through it 50 being the .22 TCM and the other 50 9mm and I had zero stoppages and also achieved great accuracy. I have about 295 rounds of ammo available for $150 extra..  If you need anymore info just google .22 TCM or check out this link of the devastating power of the .22 TCM compared to other cartridges. http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iMWB7VygMCc Will consider trades for WW2 US or German rifles and pistols.

I’m not sure how this will work out but I thought I would give this a try and see how it goes!

I’m looking at selling or trading two cars and some spare parts for weapons, ammo, cash!

I really DON’T want to do this but I’m beginning to lose interest in the cars because they are just sitting around waiting for their next phase! I’m either going to get rid of everything and clear out my garage so I can have room to do the woodworking that I’ve wanted to do for over decade OR I’m going BIG, which means I’m going to sink another 10-12K in the car and make it a freaking monster – an XL clone with 427 Tri-power & 5 speed!

What I decide to do will depend on what kind of cash or weapon / ammo trade offers I get!

Make me a deal I can't refuse and both cars and the parts are yours to play with!

The two cars I'm offering are:

A very nice low mileage numbers matching Guardsman Blue 1964 Galaxie 500, 2 door sedan (Fastback) with two-tone blue interior (CAR IN AD PHOTOS)

A donor car - 1964 Galaxie 500 XL, 2 door, 390 4-BBL, console shift automatic

Some information on the Blue 289 car:

The Guardsman Blue (car in photos) has: the original a 289 2BBL engine and Auto. Transmission (Crusi-o-matic / C-4), PS, and PB. The car is 80+% restored. There's not much left to do to make it a show quality car. If you want a really nice daily driver or rod run car, it's ready for that now!

I'm supposedly the second owner of this car - technically, possibly the third. The car was sold at an estate sale in and I lost the bid, only to end up doing a side deal for an additional $1000 a few minutes later with the person who won the car! Don't ask! :-) Anyway, the guy who won the bid not only made a quick $1000 profit but he refused to let me just pay the auction house the selling price, then write him a check for the $1000 and then take the car home. NO - He made me bring cash to his dealership a few days later! I can't remember the details - whether or not his name was on the title already - but he gave me the title and I went to the local courthouse and had it put in my name. I'm pretty sure he didn't have enough time to have it put in his name in just those few days but just in case there was something going on that caused Frankfort to have the car in his name, that's why I may ""technically"" be the third owner!
Before the auction started I got a chance to talk to the original owners son. He said that he was pretty sure that his dad bought it new and as far as he knew it had always been kept in the same garage it was parked in when I first saw it at the auction. He said the car had just been painted and the engine was rebuilt but he wasn't sure about the transmission. Before the auction started, he started the car, it sounded great, there was no smoke, no unusual noises, so I believed him about the engine.

I drove the car about 50 miles home, it ran great, and I had no problems with it so I was still happy with the engine. The next day I checked the compression for each cylinder and took off the valve covers. It was clean inside and the pressures were all good so the engine was looking even better. Knowing I was going to detail the engine compartment and go through the car, I took a few days to pull and strip the engine down to a short-block. After carefully inspecting everything, it was apparent to me that the engine was in fact rebuilt recently – at that time.
Despite knowing that the engine was already fresh and all I really needed to do was install new gaskets and put everything back together, I spent several months cleaning, inspecting, repainting, rebuilding and replacing every part I took off of the engine. All male and female thread surfaces were cleaned with a tap and die set and solvent, blown out and then lightly oiled.
New internal parts include: master rebuild gasket set, oil pump, timing chain/gears, and freeze plugs.

The heads are not set up to run on un-leaded gas so you have to add lead to the tank each time you fill up the tank - not a big deal and it's relatively cheap and easy to find.

Other new parts added to the engine: OEM distributer, cap and internals; coil, plugs & wires; water pump; fuel pump, and generator.
All engine brackets and attaching parts were made to look better than new – cleaned, stripped, and or bead blasted - and then primed and painted as necessary to the proper paint code.

The transmission was rebuilt locally and it was installed with a new filter, torque converter, and modulator valve.

I completely stripped the front end of this car down to it's bare bones (the frame) - from the firewall forward. Then I cleaned, rebuilt, refinished or replaced EVERY THING!
Most replacement parts are either NOS FOMOCO, brand new FOMOCO, FOMOCO licensed reproductions, or a high quality name brands. I went to great lengths to get as close as I could to making this car look just as good and in some cases better than it did on the day it rolled off of the assembly line. Some subtle modifications / substitutions were made but you will really have to know these cars to find them!
All new ""MOOG"" front suspension parts.
All new or rebuilt Power Steering parts.
The brakes were gone through, inside out, from front to rear, and they now stop the car on a dime! I bead blasted, painted, and then resurfaced the OEM drums; replaced the wheel bearings and seals; installed new hydraulic wheel / brake cylinders; put on new pads with all new attaching hardware and springs - all 4 wheels have new parts on them.
I also put on a new OEM style brake fluid reservoir W/ OEM style cap with a new power brake unit behind it. I even put SILICONE brake fluid in the system so it won't rust from the inside out!
NOTE - you CAN NOT mix normal Dot 3 brake fluid with silicone brake fluid! With this car You will either have to add silicone fluid whenever you need it OR you will have to drain and flush the whole system, then remove all traces of the silicone fluid with a solvent - alcohol works best - and then replace with DOT 3 and re-bleed the whole system.

Both front fenders and fender wells were stripped, bead blasted, primed and painted. The underside of the inner fender-well and most of the underside of the car was also undercoated with eastwood rubberized undercoating.
All of the rubber spacers and seals for the fenders and radiator core support, and most of the fasteners (mounting bolts and cage nuts) were replaced with new OEM style replacements.
The original radiator was replaced with a good quality after market radiator.
I dropped the gas tank, flushed it out, stripped and cleaned the outside, then I primed, painted and undercoated it. Since I had the tank out I stripped off the road grime, undercoating and paint from the underside of the trunk pan. I sandblasted some minor surface rust areas and the tank straps and then I zinc primer coated the whole area, painted everything, and added rubberized undercoating. Before I installed the tank I replaced the fuel sending unit, ran a new steel gas line all the way to the front and replaced the rubber hoses on both ends.

I went through the rear brakes and did some work on the rear end. I bead blasted, painted, and then turned the rear drums. I replaced the rear axle seals and bearings; the hydraulic brake cylinders; the brake pads, attaching hardware and springs; and the metal brake lines.
I did not pull the whole rear end and springs out of the car like I wanted to but I did drain and refill the hoghead with high temp gear oil after I replaced the gasket, yoke seal and both U-joints. No leaks and no strange noises in the rear end!
The rear end of the car does sag a little so I have a brand new set of replacement leaf springs that I will include with the trade.
The inside of the trunk is clean – no rust! It has the original liner and jack assembly, both of which are in very nice condition and the trunk does not leak!

All of the chrome and stainless trim is in really nice condition. The glass looks great except the windshield which has a BB ding along the bottom few inches, almost centered left to right, and clearly out of your field of view. The donor car has a good windshield in it!

The car has new radial tires – has a very smooth ride.

The interior is a 9.5 out of 10. The headliner and padded dash were replaced and all of the seat covers were professionally recovered. The carpet and door panels are like new originals. The OEM Radio, clock, gauges, lighter, speedometer, dash lights, switches, heater and controls, all work and look great!

Really great rifle and a real shooter; holds tighter than me at the bench. You WILL be very happy with how tight this groups (I have had best luck with 75 grain Hornady steel match ammo).
The triggers on the 556 line of Sig rifles is superb.

I'm quite happy with this rifle and honestly don't NEED to sell it but if WASRs are selling for over $1,200 in the current environment.....I have to imagine there is someone out there that actually wants a quality firearm.

Last week there was a black plain-Jane Sig 556 posted asking $4000, it's a sellers market and the ""gun-environment"" is pretty crazy right now. If you think the price is too high feel free to make me a counter offer if you are serious.
NY handgun permit holders are preferred, I will want to see photo ID and a signed bill of sale. FtF in the Rochester area (but outside the city limits) works but will ship via FFl on your dime if desired.

-This has a 16"" rifle in 1:7 twist.
-chambered for 5.56 NATO
-Takes AR mags
-Piston operated (operates clean and cool)

I am the first and only owner.
Rifle born on date: July 2012.
I have fired approx 350-400 rounds through it.
It is in excellent condition, the only blemish is where the extracted brass hits the body this is a characteristic of these rifles and is quite minor IMO (see picture).

Again this is already NY compliant:
-Pinned Troy Claymore muzzle break (I love this break doesn't kill your ears like every other brake on the firing line)
-Pinned stock

Included:
-Original box
-2 10 round mags (in FDE to match)
-Sig manual"

It is lightly used and has some blemishes on the plastic and the pressure switch is brand new. The light is listed as a max output of 125+ lumens with an hour run time. I have run it for alot longer than 1 hour and it is water proof to 20 meters.

I accept paypal and will pay for the shipping so no one is traveling. Once the payment is received in paypal it will be shipped (just like ebay).  That way I know the money is good but if you don't have to worry because if it doesn't get shipped you retract payment.  safe for both parties.  Other than trades I will only accept paypal.   I will also accept trades on tactical shotguns that are lightly used or a good hand gun of similar price maybe even another decent rifle. I am open to most guns and if your looking to sell one and it is more than this and your looking for a good AR set up I can pay the difference.

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths and in either 5.56mm NATO or 6.8mm SPC. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

Cut to ATF standards.  Comes with original stock, bolt, barrel and other parts in picture.  If your looking for parts, or looking to build your own semi auto piece of history here it is.  Most parts for the semi conversion can be found online.  It comes with a new U.S. made trunion.  The barrel has been demilled at some point in its life, it has a weld that looks to go about 3/4"" into the receiver end of the barrel.  Its a 7.62X25 and you can get 16 inch barrels online for the build unless you want to get the SBR stamp.  Look on gunbroker at the cost of the parts kits with actual bids on them and also at completed semi auto rifles.  I love the WWII guns and wanted to do the semi conversion, but just dont have the time.  Im asking $250 for the parts.  you could always get it and put it on gunbroker and make some money it doesnt require a FFL to sell or ship since it doesnt have a complete receiver.  Will consider trades for guns or ammo of equal value.

This is the military style with the metal inside the bipod legs to withhold more weight and abuse. 1 brand new in the wrapping Knights Armament Micro 600 rear flip sight that ranges from 200-600 meters. And 1 used Insight Technologies/EOTech M3X Tactical Illuminator with pressure switch and velcro to put it where you want it. It is lightly used and has some blemishes on the plastic and the pressure switch is brand new. The light is listed as a max output of 125+ lumens with an hour run time. I have run it for alot longer than 1 hour and it is water proof to 20 meters. I have money wrapped up in this so my price is firm at $500 but with the price of mags going above 25 for usgi and the rest of the gear here being 550 by itself no low balls. I accept paypal and will pay for the shipping so no one is traveling. Once the payment is received in paypal it will be shipped (just like ebay).  That way I know the money is good but shipment will be guaranteed.   I will also accept trades on tactical shotguns that are lightly used or a good hand gun of similar price maybe even a decent bolt action. I am open to most guns and if your looking to sell one and it is more than this and your looking for a good AR set up I can pay the difference. If you want to trade we will work out shipment and FFL stuff as I am located in NC.

They have been removed from the plastic but have never been fired or loaded with ammo. 1 brand new still in the plastic and bubble wrap black GripPod GPS-02.  This is the military style with the metal inside the bipod legs to withhold more weight and abuse. 1 brand new in the wrapping Knights Armament Micro 600 rear flip sight that ranges from 200-600 meters. And 1 used Insight Technologies/EOTech M3X Tactical Illuminator with pressure switch and velcro to put it where you want it. It is lightly used and has some blemishes on the plastic and the pressure switch is brand new. The light is listed as a max output of 125+ lumens with an hour run time. I have run it for alot longer than 1 hour and it is water proof to 20 meters. I have money wrapped up in this so my price is firm at $500 but with the price of mags going above 25 for usgi and the rest of the gear here being 550 by itself no low balls. I accept paypal and will pay for the shipping so no one is traveling. Once the payment is received in paypal it will be shipped (just like ebay).  That way I know the money is good but your shipment is guaranteed.  I will also accept trades on tactical shotguns that are lightly used or a good hand gun of similar price maybe a good bolt action. I am open to most guns and if your looking to sell one and it is more than this and your looking for a good AR set up I can pay the difference. If you want to trade we will work out shipment and FFL stuff as I am located in NC.

They've never been used. There are some minor scratches from shipping and what looks like test fitting in a magwell. They all have the grey Magpul anti-tilt follower in them. 
I'm not looking to make a ton of money on these, just my money back for cost and shipping to here. 
Email with any questions. 
P.S. If you know a place that sells them $15 each, go there. Resist the urge to tell me about it."
