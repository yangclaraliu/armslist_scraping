also have a 1962 browning nomad.perfect working condition and good finish.i doubt this gun has had very many rounds thru it at all.only thing that hurts it from passing as 99% is very slight finish wear on the front sight and trigger guard and initials just above the trigger from previous owner.has the alloy frame book shows +10% for that.i think being the very 1rst year of what started the buck marks makes it a big bonus too.these are made 10 times better then a new buck marks that cost 400-500$ too.looking for 400 for it.dont have a pic of the browning but u can google it to see what they look like."

Model History: This model made in a large production numbers from 1946-1950; developed during WWII by the group of the Czech designers, namely Ladislav Schmitmayer, Vaclav Jindra and Jindrich Brejcha in CZ plant at Uhersky Brod. They received help from an another six gunsmiths working at that time in R&D shop. Work was done secretly as an above mentioned group kept development of CZ 241 from the Germans, who occupied the factory at that time.  During the years 1942-1944 the CZ 241 underwent a heavy testing and the tests proved that CZ 241 is an excellent shotgun.  In the last test, before full production was introduced, the gun was successfully fired eighty thousand times without one problem.  After liberation of former Czechoslovakia, the CZ 241 went into a full production in 1946.  It was produced in three gauges: 12, 16, 20.  Weight of the shotgun is 2,90 kg.  Production started in a factory at City of Strakonice, but very shortly after, the production of the CZ 241 was shifted to CZ's plant in Uhersky Brod. In years 1946-1947 the receiver of CZ 241 were made from light alloy material sourced from the propellers of the American planes shot down over the area by the Germans during the war.  The barrels were made of an excellent material which was used to make the barrels for an aircraft machine gun MG 131."

$500,000 NEW UNCIRCULATED IRAQI DINARS

20 Brand New $25,000 Dinars 

Picture Iraq as a company selling stock.  Each Dinar you purchase represents a share in Iraq's future.  As Iraq recovers from the removal of Saddam Hussein, and starts rebuilding, the country's infrastructure resumes production. Boasting the 3rd largest oil reserves in the world,

Saudi Arabia	$1 = 3.69 Riyal
United Arab Emirates	$1 = 3.67 Dirham
Kuwait	                $1 = 0.267 KWD 
Afghanistan	$1 = 43.40AFN
Iraq 	                $1 = 1168 Iraqi Dinars

The above represents approximate rates as of 8/26/2011. 
Exchange rates are subject to change.

The Iraqi Dinar was worth $US3.20 before the United Nations embargo that followed Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 

By August 2002 it was trading at just below 2000 to the US dollar, and by mid-April 2003 it had slipped to anywhere between 3500 and 4000 against the dollar. In July 2003 one US dollar equaled about 1,500 Iraqi Dinars. 
Economic life is steadily appreciating in value. Since October 15th 2003, the start of the Iraqi Currency Exchange (ICE), the new Dinar’s worth has risen by 45%. 

“A secure currency will provide a firm foundation for Iraq ’s future"". 

Coalition Provisional Authority press release:

After two years of economic decline, the World Bank Group estimates that Iraq's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) will rebound by 33 percent this year. 
According to the Oil and Gas Journal, Iraq contains 115 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the third largest in the world (behind Saudi Arabia and Canada)

It has all the proper markings including CSA on the side. I was told the CSA marking would probably have been done after the war by a private individual so I am NOT saying it is a confederate pistol. It is missing the front sight which is common, they did this to more easily slip them into their belt. It is also missing the ejector rod, some experts told me the soldiers used a nail to push out the empty shells.

580,http://www.armslist.com/posts/230580,For Sale:  Springfield Model 1842 Musket (Civil War Era),"Northwest 80919, Colorado Springs, Colorado","$ 1,099","Listed On: Monday, November 28, 2011",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is an authentic Springfield Model 1842 smoothbore .69 caliber muzzle loading musket.  It was likely used in the Civil War.  This rifle is in good to very good condition for its age and includes the bayonet.  The ramrod is missing, but reproduction ramrods are readily available and original ramrods are often available through antique gun sellers.

This was the first regulation percussion ignition musket made at the national armories. It was also the last smoothbore U.S. arm made in .69 caliber and the first U.S. weapon made at both Springfield and Harpers Ferry.   The Model 1842 was the first small arm produced in the U.S. with fully interchangeable, machine-made parts. About 172,000 Model 1842 muskets were produced at the Springfield national armory between 1844 and 1855.  

This gun has the following stampings on the steel:
Lock:  1850 and U.S. eagle with arrows
Breech:  1852
Barrel:  V over P with an eagle head
Butt plate:  U.S. 51

The metal has brown patina throughout with some minor pitting.  The lock, trigger and hammer operate.  The wood is in good condition with typical dings, scratches and handling marks.  The wood butt also has “PM” etched in it, which is a typical soldier marking of military rifles of the era.  This rifle appears to be all original and historically correct.  It has not been cleaned, polished, repaired or altered in order to preserve its value.

The value of this rifle is in its historical significance, age and condition.  The highly visible markings on the steel hardware combined with the bayonet make this a rare find and worthy of adding to a collection or using in Civil War reenactments.

 A great Christmas gift for the Civil War enthusiast!

I will ship within the continental U.S. where legal for $30.  Buyer assumes all responsibility for legal ownership and use.  Due to the age of this gun and percussion firing mechanism, no FFL is required.

I have for sale a great gun vice. It is the p3 ultimate gun vice made right here in Wisconsin. You can buy other attachments as well to make a regular rest or pistol rest also. I have already assembled this and had it to the range 2 times. It looks new still. I am getting rid of it because the gun I got it for does not work well with it because the stock is so short since it is a carbine rifle. You can read reviews at midway and see the different attachments for it at their own website. Great for sighting in scopes or testing reloads.

The timing belt and sway bar end links will need to be replaced but is for sure drivable for a long time without them. This is a job under 200 bucks and easy to do yourself. The car is not in the best shape as far as looks go. there are a few minor dents, a couple spots the paint is chipped, and around every wheel there is rust. NO big dents or anything but could also use a good bath inside and out. Great first car or gas saving daily driver with the 4cl engine. Its an automatic and clean title in hand. Also the windows have been professionally tinted and comes with the american racing wheels in the pick. can also give you the original wheels too. Tires are in great shape and ready to go. The cd player in pic is the only thing not going with it. It has the factory in now. Im pretty firm on price because of the blue book and the extras mine has. I would take a gun in on partial trade. I need 1600 cash so the gun would have to be under 700 in value. cant trade car straight up for gun even if gun is worth it.

This Llama is a 1911/Government style pistol, with ribbed top slide with fixed front sight & rear sights. Serrated front strap and matching serrations on main spring housing (straight line, not checkering), It has a grip safety and a thumb safety.

It's stainless steel slide (marked as ""chrome"" on the box) and frame show some wear, due to normal use.  Comes with the Llama factory black grips, which have cracks and probably need to be replaced.  It should accept standard 1911 grips, available almost anywhere.  There are 2 Mags (9rd capacity) included with this pistol.  One is junk, the other is a Springfield mag, which mates up perfectly.  This pistol accepts all 9mm 1911 magazines.  I have the original box as well.  

This pistol was purchased new in the early to mid 90s by my father, and has spent the vast majority of it's life in a gun cabinet.  If I had to make a guess, I'd say it has 500-700 rounds put through it over it's lifetime.  I haven't shot it in years, but it operated well as I recall.  I stripped it down after taking the attached pictures, and gave it a good cleaning.  The bore is bright and shiny, and the weapon function checked flawlessly.

Similar and Identical pistols are on gunbroker for anywhere from 300-400 dollars, plus you have to pay shipping and FFL Fee.  I'm asking 250 bucks for it.  I will require a NC Pistol Purchase Permit, or a NC Concealed Carry License from the purchaser in order to abide by state law.  

Nine One Zero Five Four Five Four Six Four Eight for questions or pictures.

Am not interested in trades.  The asking price of $250 bucks is firm.  Thanks, hope to hear from you."

The gun is in real good shape with less than 100 rounds fired and all numbers match. These haven't been imported since the 1994 import ban. Very few made it into the US Nickel plated. These pistols are very rare and top quality, the steel is 5100 Ordnance grade tool steel compared to the 4140 the US manufactures still use. The compensator is aftermarket but it matches the gun so perfect it looks factory. The original grips were lost but installed is a set of Strike Industries ""golf ball"" grips. They are comfortable but this gun needs some wood or pearl grips to set it off right. Could use a little Flitz polish to make it shine a little brighter and git rid of a small amount of oxidization where the front of the grips are. I may even polish it up within the next couple days. I'd rate this gun at 98-99%. I love this 1911 but I have been wanting a milled Chinese AK for a while now. If you have what I'm looking for please message me and we'll see what we can work out.

Features:
-Heavy-duty free float half quad rail system.  Very well made and looks great.
-Flip-Up front sight assembly on gas block
-3 sling swivels
-T-marked receiver rails
-Custom compensator.  Very effective at reducing recoil and scalloped for close engagements

Barrel has around 1K rounds throught it.  Kept in safe and well maintained.  Minor blemishes from rail attachments.  This is a very high quality upper which I ordered from the factory.  The mid-length gas system and compensator make for a very smooth shooting AR.  While worthy of action and competition shooting, it is also very accurate and would make for a great hog/coyote rifle with a scope mounted.

It is the 5"" target model and comes with all included tools, interchangeable backstraps, box, lock, paperwork, etc...  Like all of them it has a manual safety and an internal magazine safety.  It really is a sweet shooter and has been dead-on accurate for me.  My biggest complaint is that it just doesn't fit my personal hand like I want it to.  

Has been cleaned religiously and is a doll baby.  Still under factory warranty if anything should go wrong.  Call up Smith and Wesson CS that handles Walther USA.  Best firearm servicing there is in my opinion. 

I'm asking $400 for the package.  And I have some extras to include if a nice trade offer comes in, or to sweeten a deal if necessary.
