We'll need to discuss some alternative pricing for gas expenses.


** REQUIREMENTS **
Cash Only deal, and i'll need to see a valid Kentucky Drivers License or CCDW License for proof of your name & age, then the gun is yours.


** CONSIDERABLE TRADES **
I would consider a trade towards some high powered bolt action rifles (.270 - .308, etc). I'd preferably like to trade straight, and would like if the rifle came with a scope already on it + some ammo.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand.

Made in Finland. Bofors heavy barrel. The L579 was designed in 1959 with a Medium action for .243 and .308. Serial number indicates this rifle was made in 1964. Excellent condition. Has Leupold VARI-X III 6.5x20 Adjustable Multi-Coat Golden Ring Scope mounted. Has flip open Butler Creek dust covers. Scope is clear as a crystal. Also included, scopelevel, original factory scope rings and two sunshades (rifle is pictured with the longest sunshade installed). Also, two full and one partial boxes of ammo.  The rear screw-in slingmount has been removed for bench shooting and I do not have it. A factory replacement can be ordered for $18.

Sako arguably made the finest production rifles in that era. They are now owned by Berreta and are known for the finest production sniper rifles, even supplying the TRP to the US Marines.

This is an excellent shooter. Dead on accurate. Rare find, especially in this condition.

Bersa writes:  By preserving the features of the bigger models but also reducing its size, we have obtained one of the best semi-automatic pistols for this caliber. Sights: Rear Sight: Front sight: Finishes:

Although its capacity is smaller than Thunder 40 PRO, 10 rounds of caliber 40 S&W is a good option for a self defense pistol. Keeping the accuracy and reliability of the high capacity models, this pistol has a surprisingly compact size and extremely comfortable.

This model is 100% ambidextrous like high capacity versions. Its safety and decocker lever and slide stop levers are located on both sides of the gun. The magazine catch is also reversible. The location of the safety and decocker grant unequalled comfort and perfect grip.

The Thunder 40 Ultra Compact PRO has the Improved Browning Petter barrel locking system, giving an excellent reliability during ejection of empty cases and feeding live ammo.

Safety.  Safety is first and foremost, and Thunder 40 Ultra Compact PRO has many safety devices: manual safety lever and decocker, firing pin safety hammer automatically remains in half cock notch and separate the hammer from the firing pin, and a new loaded chamber indicator.This compact pistol has also a Integral Locking System, to store the gun safely.

REAR SIGHT: Dovetail fixed, with white dots, u or bar for faster target acquisition.

The G.41 is a gas-operated rifle that fires the full-power 8mm Mauser cartridge. This rifle is in very good condition and has been professionally refinished/restored. The serial numbered parts are matching and there are no import markings. The magazine, barrel bands, gas cylinder and nose cone have been refinished. The buttplate has been buffed bright. There was a crack behind the receiver which has been strengthened/repaired with a bolt which has been inserted cross-wise and the ends covered with wood patches. There is a large round repair to the sling slot area and a couple of holes filled with square pegs at the underside of the butt and forend. The stock has been lightly sanded but the original cartouches are still visible on the right side of the butt. The original plastic handguard is in excellent shape without cracks. Mechanically, the rifle appears to function properly and the bore is very good, near excellent, and free of pits. A tough rifle for the collector to locate, the G.41 was produced in limited numbers as it was soon superceded by the improved G.43 semi-auto rifle. This is a very nice looking example!"

All marking are clear (nothing erased or re-stamped), and all numbers match, which is unusual. Unlike this one, Finnish captured rifles have usually been reworked with whatever parts they could find. Not so with this one. It still has cosmoline on it from storage and is guaranteed to function fine once cleaned up. Also comes with 40 rounds of Ammo.

I purchased it through Aim Surplus. I had plans to maybe put the ATI stock on it but I never got the time to work on it so I am just selling it. I took it out of the box and checked all things for being in perfect working condition and put it into my storage.

There is no cleaning rod, which is common for these.
The bolt is easy to operate and doesnt stick.
The barrel is in good condition and the rifling is great.
The wood stock has only slight minor scratches.
The gun is 57 yeards old and if you clean the cosmoline off I am sure it will fire like it's new.

The price is firm. Mosin's are becoming rare and the price is only going up in 2007 a 91/30 went for under a $100 now its $240 at the gun shops.

Cash and serious buyers only."

Bolt and Receiver numbers match and the anti-aircraft rear sight is in place and functional.Seems to be pre- or early war production. Chambered in 6.5mm Jap. There is no major damage to the stock, although obviously as a battle rifle it has been used. Action is decently smooth and locks up tight. Bore is sharp with no pitting.Bluing is mostly intact although there is some minor rust spots near the muzzle and the trigger guard/floorplate has seen wear. Comes with leather sling and intact cleaning rod. 
Open to interesting trades can add cash for the right trade, unsure of cash value but lets say $300.00.
