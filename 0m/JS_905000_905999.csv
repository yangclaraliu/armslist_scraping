I have a great deal for you. I mean outstanding.

Long range and short range become one with the package I'm about to present to you.

Up for grabs is a Remington 700 VTR chambered in .308 , which comes with a Nikon ProStaff Rifle Scope (with Bullet drop Compensator) as well as a Harris Bipod! This rifle has been gunsmith/armorer-condition kept and has an adjustable (and very light) trigger as well. By itself, this rifle is worth $800, the bipod another $100, and the optic is well over $150. Oh, and the rifle is practically unfired. Less than 40 rounds of Hornady match ammo.

That isn't all- Also up for grabs is the Remington 870 Express Magnum with speedfeed stock (holds ammunition) and truglo sights! This baby has been well kept and maintained as well. We're talking 500 collective dollars of shotgun, and that's lowballing it.


It breaks my heart to do this, but I recently took a huge pay cut thanks to a career change and huge oversight(and subsequent collection) from Veteran's Affairs and the bills are piling up, Seriously. Sell some of my guns or forego electricity and water. That's what it's come down to. Gotta love this economy, eh? 

So here is the deal. You're getting well, well over what I'm asking. It sucks (for me), I know, but as I mentioned.. Man has to make sacrifices sometimes for himself and his loved ones. Make my loss your gain and call me today. Make it $1,000 and I will toss in ammunition for both and a soft tactical rifle case that will comfortably hold both.

I am going to upgrade all my Dillon stuff to a XL 1050, I want to see what I can get for ALL my reloading equipment.  This will be an all or nothing deal.

Here is what I have and am looking for out of it.  I do not need to sell this nor is it a must that I upgrade as my 650's are basically new!

90% of this still has the boxes...

First, I have a bench that fits 2 650's on it along with room for extra stuff.  Full bottom shelf for buckets of brass and the whole back has a peg board!

2 Dillon XL650's
2 Case Feeders
4 Dillon powder checks
3 sets of Dillon pistol Carbide Dies: 45 acp, 9mm, 38/357 mag
3 XL 650 quick change kits 
Machines come set up with 45 acp and 38/357 conversion kit. 
Also comes with conversion kits for 45acp, 38/357, and 9mm
2 Strong mounts
1 Roller handle
1 Bullet tray
1 Large pistol case feed plate
1 Small pistol case feed plate
2 Dillon case tumblers
1 Dillon media separator 
A few extra Dillon single Dies
A few extra powder bars
Extra springs for the XL 650's
I think I have a few extra tool heads

Pics to come... I am just down 80 into IL 20 mins west of Munster area in Orland Park.

This will be PICK UP only.  

When I went through Dillons website, this is what I came up with...
Price just for equipment from Dillon is $3200
Extra parts is probably around $50 bucks or so
Bench roughly: $200.00
Total: $3450.00
-15% used discount but, condition is LIKE NEW: $510.00
Total: $2940.00
My asking price is: $2850.00 firm

Again, I am just throwing this out there to see if upgrading is possible for me.  I will not separate this set up.  Additionally, I will not sell this unseen.  You must come out to see it and then buy it.  First Ill take it will get it, followed by a PM.  If there is more than once interested people, the first Ill take it will get the chance to come out and look first, followed by 2nd,3rd, and so on.  Once you have seen it, it will be sold to the first person with cash to me.

Wanting to trade for a Ruger, single action in 44 mag.  Looking for 5 1/2"" or shorter 
barrel, but not shorter than 3 1/2"" May consider a 357 mag Ruger Vaquero 
I am not interested in 45 Long colt Rugers.
This AP-9 extremely clean and functions with out any problems....and is a lot of fun
Also comes with custom fabricated OD green sling
This gun is similar to the Tec-9, even uses the same mags, but the rifleling is a little
deeper than the Tec-9 and considered more accurate.  This has a 5"" barrel 

The AP-9 is a pistol that was manufactured by AA Arms and distributed by Kimel Industries, Inc of Indian Trail, North Carolina, US AAArms began distributing the AP-9 in the early 1990s and did so until 2001

I will list this as a Tec-9 so will pop up in a search....for there is not a separate category for this AP-9"

700 rounds of Polish stab-crimped FMJ ammo are also available.  
You can take as much or as little of it as you want @ $.30 per round.

If you take the whole package (CZ52 with extra mag AND the 700 rds.) the price is $525. 

During scenarios like the current ammo shortage and any future civil emergencies, this package is like money in the bank. Because the milsurp ammo supply has nearly dried up,
four different companies are producing new 7.62x25 ammo but it's priced considerably higher than 9mm... So owning extra ammo puts you ahead of the game already. 

This ammo has a strong and 100% reliable charge which sends 85 gr. FMJ bullets out at a very fast speed of approx. 1500 feet per second. I haven't had one problem with this ammo or this gun! 
(The ammo shown in the bottom picture with the map background is the actual ammo for this offer... Not the shiny commercial stuff that's in the other pics. The M57 gun in the map picture has been spoken for, so is NOT for sale at this time.)

The Czech CZ52 has a 4.7"" barrel and has a magazine capacity of 8+1.
These were carried by East European military and police personnel in the Cold War days.  
Formidable yet a pleasure to shoot recoil-wise, their reliability and accuracy is impressive. It's a CZ!  

Buyer must show current NC CCW permit and meet within 1/2 hr. drive of Greensboro. 
NO out-of-state sales.

Only shot (no kidding) less then 20 times, or maybe not at all, i forget. She is a safe queen, just dont need and want something else. This is the true Piston, designed from the ground up that way not some mod done years later like AR piston designs. Does have the optics mounting point on the side."

This was made to pass the last import and assault weapons ban.    This rifle can only accept the 10 round magazines made for this rifle,  included  are 3 magazines.    This is one of the more accurate 7.62x39 AK type rifles I have shot.    The bipod is aftermarket and is easily removed as it is simply a barrel clamp on type.    The barrel is hard chrome lined, and the muzzle brake is pinned on as it left the factory,   It has a factory,  Choate branded thumbhole type stock.   The feel of this rifle is very solid,    I would say the total round count of this rifle is less than 1000,  I have put fewer than approximately 500 thru it since I have owned it since about 2001 and have had 100% reliability with it.   I hate to see this rifle go,   I just dont shoot it much.    Not enough time or ammo!

This armor was produced by First Choice Armor Company between 2009 and 2011. It has been in warehouse storage.  There are no rips, tears, stains, marks, or holes that I am aware of.  

The outer plate carrier is a dark navy blue color with two rows of MOLLE on the front chest, four rows on the back panel, and two rows on the sides.  The carrier adjusts for height by adjusting the velcro shoulder straps.  The carrier adjusts for waist size with velcro on the side panels that land on a velcro panel on the front of the carrier.  Inside both front and back panels of the carrier is a compartment that will accept ESAPI plates up to size 10"" X 12"".  The plate pockets are secured with velcro.  There is an area of velcro on the back panel of the carrier that allows for attachment of an armored collar for neck protection. The rear of the carrier has an emergency drag handle.  There is also a small velcro area on the front panel for attachment of an armored throat protector.  The front panel has a short row of MOLLE at the bottom for attachment of a groin protector.  The width of the rear panel with attached sides is 39"".  The width of the front panel is 20"".  Will fit up to 50"" chest.  Allow a few inches of overlap onto the front panel for secure attachment.

The kevlar insert panels are also new and unissued.  The front panel is slightly smaller than the real panel.  The front panel is 15"" tall, 11"" wide at the top, and 19"" wide at the bottom.  The rear panel is 17"" tall, 11"" wide at the top, and 19"" wide at the bottom.  They are rated NIJ level IIIA.  They consist of 50 layers of Honeywell Goldflex inside a waterproof nylon shell.  Honeywell Goldflex is ounce for ounce stronger than Kevlar and thinner as well.  There are no ratings or identification tags of the armor panels themselves.

I also have several brand new MICH Kevlar combat helmets rated IIIA, as well as groin armor for these vests."

This line of rifles is among the first to come stock with polymer receiver, making it 40% lighter and more shock resistant than a standard aluminum receiver. The slim pencil style barrel, low profile gas block, and CAR-15 style stock only enhance what is already one of the lightest and most maneuverable AR's on the market. The included red dot scope is light, simple and reliable while the sight allows the user to quickly aim the weapon in any situation.

This rifle has been with me for about a year and a half. PRS stock is brand new, upper, lower, and BCG have seen about 1000 rounds, barrel was changed last year, properly seasoned break-in process followed, roughly 250 rounds down range, trigger also changed with the barrel. The only bad blemish spot is on the forward assist, you can clearly see how many casings have struck it during the ejection process by the brass line towards the front. Other than that, she’s a well kept firearm, cleaned after every range day, stored in a case with desiccant gel, and only top quality upgrades have been made.

""The Romanian SAR-1. The SAR series of rifles is well known through the gun community as being one of the only AK-47 rifles imported into the United States on an original military specification receiver. They are known for excellent quality and extreme reliability (unlike the current Romanian WASR rifles) Almost all other AK 47 rifles in the country were either built here using other countries parts or imported as low capacity rifles and then drilled out for full magazines here in the States. Not so with the SAR rifles, they were built as they are in the country that makes them for their military. The SAR-1 is a fantastic weapon, combining the durability and ruggedness of the AK-47 with the lightweight ammo and accuracy of the American 7.62x39 round.""

All bought in 2012.  I ran 22 rounds through this pistol. This is a great well balanced gun that carries very well for a stout well made gun. Will not separate.  I am selling to purchase another pistol. These are selling used on gun broker dot com for between $550 and $600 all day long for just the gun/plastic case with no accessories and I was told Ruger is on back order on this model. Today is 1.24.2013. I am gonna give this site a little bit longer then remove this listing and place on gun broker pretty soon. Not interested in trades. Sorry, This listing has sold. 

So that scammers are clear-this gun will not be transferred into new ownership until I first have cash in hand (that means if given a check or money order, I will wait until the bank clears the funds before the handgun is transferred to the new owner. Of course this process can take up to three weeks) Why would someone send something that they have of value before the money is in hand? There are a lot of naive people out there. Don't let yourself fall victim to check deception, it's rampant and ever present.

This is a very early postwar Smith and Wesson .38 Military & Police revolver. The S is actually part of the serial number. The S prefix guns were all made before the spring of 1948. This one dates back from late 1947 or early 1948. Only a factory letter can tell you exactly when it shipped, and it could be later, because S&W never shipped in serial number order. Sometimes revolvers sat in the vault for months or even years before they shipped. 
The stocks on this revolver are also period. This style only shipped for a few years right after the war. Later stocks looked a lot like this, but had a more rounded shoulder. If you take them off, you will probably find the serial number of this gun stamped into the wood of the right panel on the inside. That is the one location that will not include the S prefix.
This revolver is in very nice condition. The only wear/damage I see is on the bottom of the right stock panel. 
It is not really a collectible. For a gun in this era to fit that criterion, it would need to be As-new-in-box. However, it is a particularly nice revolver and some collectors might have an interest in it.
