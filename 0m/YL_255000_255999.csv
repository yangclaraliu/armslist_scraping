Changing up my pistol collection a bit, and due to an injured elbow, having a hard time with the shotty. So I'm throwing together a REALLY nice little package here.

I'm not some shmuck trying to unload ragged out old guns, both of these are in excellent c ondition! Will be available tomorrow to meet at range, so you can try them out. 

The Glock! Gen3 G22 RTF2, has the most amazing grip, the first Glock I haven't put grip-tape on. You can dunk your hands in motor oil, and you won't lose your grip on this gun. I've had this gun for awhile now, was my EDC, trust my life to it 110%. Has never had a FTF, goes bang every single time. She is completely stock aside from a grip plug, as a Glock should be. Carried with pride, cleaned religiously after every use.

Comes with; Three factory 15rd mags, loaded with 180gr Win Ranger Bonded JHPs. Because I care enough to send the very best...  ;) Full 50rd box of the same. T.H.E. weighted brass grip plug.  Acc. rail-mount ambidextrious laser(mounted in 1st pic, not in 2nd). Nothing fancy, I don't shoot with lasers, just use 'em for dry-fire practice.  Fobus roto-paddle holster. Spare factory recoil spring & Glock dissy tool. Original case, papers, cable lock.  

The shotty! Remington 870 12ga Exp Magnum. Great home defense/tactical shotty! This is the SG built to run not only the standard 2.75"" shells, but also the devastating 3"" Magnum loads. Starting on the reliable, tough-as-nails 870 Express Magnum frame, has been upgraded with the following...  

Hogue ""Tamer"" grip set Mossberg 18"" Tac barrel. Choate Mag extension, to 7+1 capacity. (tube dimples smoothed, NOT drilled)   This is not an over done ""Tacti-cool"" boat anchor. I like em simple, useable, & effective. 

Also, comes with all the OE hunting gear, all in like-new condition. Wood grip/stock, wood fore grip, 26"" vent-rib hunting long barrel, birdshot plug. Basically, two shotguns in one!  :)  Come with a nice pile of ammo as well.    

Will sell this package for $1,150 firm. But would much rather do some trading. Would like to trade for a gun+cash from my list below.   Will consider a trade for two guns straight up(or small cash), but only if one of them is a Gen3 G23. I have another full-size .40 already, would like a G23 for carry.(Doesn't have to be a RTF2, but that would be a big plus!)

CRKT Hissatsu Fixed Blade Knife--Designed BY James Williams.
The Hissatsu's dual grind Tanto blade is 440A stainless steel, high satin finished. For those who prefer a non-reflective finish, the Hissatsu is in Desert Tan dress with titanium nitride blade coating. 
The handle is in a traditional Japanese pattern, but is Twin-Fused™, double injection-molded with a high-impact polypropylene core, butt and hilt, and a non-slip soft textured rubber grip handle surface. Oyatsubo, the emperor node on the omote (outside/public side) of the tuska (handle), allows you to know which direction the blade is facing, even in compromised lighting conditions, by touch.

I will say up front, this is the IA FEG APK Mark II PPK, not a Walther.  This firearm has the serial # of 00007.  Thats right, Bond gun, bond serial #.   I took this to the gun show this past weekend and had several trade and cash offers, however I decided to pass right now.  You all know that offers from a gun show aren't going to be very respectful, however this is a hard gun to put a value on.  It's value is purely from a collector and uniqueness standpoint as the gun isn't very rare itself.  However I will say that this gun is truly a 98% perfect gun.  Unfired from the day it was purchased over 40 years ago.   The firearm also comes with both original magazines and the original box.  If you all have any questions or would like to see it please feel free to call me.  

I'll entertain all cash offers and will also consider trades for Colts (multiple models), or unique firearms also.  If this does not sell here, I will hold it for the giant Wanenmacher's Tulsa Arms Show this March where there are 2 different dealers coming out of state that want to see it at the next show.  So it's not a giant deal if it does not trade hands on this ad, but I figured I'd put it on here just to see what happens.  If you want to try and make a deal, please give me a shout any time.

We will also clean and polish the inside of the magazine tube and the follower for improved feeding performance and reliability. The entire action is then treated with a heat applied metal conditioner and lubricant. The gun is reassembled, function checked again, headspace checked and fired for function. The completed action will be smooth and reliable for years to come. Forcing Cone Lenghtning and Barrel Honing & Polishing: We modify the forcing cone using our proprietary profile, then hone and polish the chamber for improved extraction, and hone and polish the forcing cone and bore all the way to the muzzle to remove tight spots and manufacturing marks. The result is approximately 30% reduction in felt recoil and an improvement in the tightness and evenness of the shot pattern that has to be seen to be believed. This is where the greatest gains in barrel performance occur and our barrel performance equals or exceeds anything out there. Mag-Na-Porting: (Except Breacher Barrels) The latest EDM porting system in the industry. Elliptical metering ports electronically cut, not drilled, resulting in reduced felt recoil, reduced muzzle jump and faster follow up shots. No damage to finishes, no bulges or burrs and a diffused muzzle flash/signature in low light. The ultimate Porting System.

If you're into military surplus from a certain region, you know exactly what this is.

This is still ""new in the box"" - I bought it from Aim Surplus several years ago and never actually took 'er out to shoot.

Back then they were selling for $109 with a $20 ""hand pick"" fee. I did the hand pick, but I'm not sure it buys you more than the least ugly commie rifle. In any case, it's certainly better looking than what they're selling now for $129.

I paid $129 plus shipping and sales tax. So $100 sounds like a good price to me- good discount on online price plus no shipping or sales tax.

Has the accessories - belt holder, belt, oiler, tools but NOT the pigsticker.  Repeat: no bayonet.

The rifle is dated 1942.  The arsenal symbol is a wreath.  Or a dolphin. Or possibly Obama's birth certificate jpeg.  I've got extra old eyes today.

I am cleaning out my gunroom and selling stuff I don't fire, so I will entertain reasonable offers, but cash only, no trades. I am not trying to just move the pieces around.

If you are local and have a CCL or a pistol permit we can do this face to face. If you are local and don't have a CCL/permit we will do it through an FFL. I will ship to your FFL (at your cost) if they'll hold the gun until I get cash.

Note: this is a surplus commie rifle.  We didn't win the cold war just 'cause our women were hotter.  I have tried to describe this rifle accurately, but it's sold as-is and you should always talk to your gunsmith before firing a used firearm.  Or have your brother in law do it for you."

=================
About Pepper Spray:

This spray has an Ultra-Violet Light Identifying Dye (which helps to ID these Ass-holes) includes both a clip (to easily attach it to your clothes while walking) and a key ring.

PEPPER SPRAY FACTS: Pepper spray enables you to defend yourself while keeping a safe distance from an attacker. Pepper sprays induce an almost immediate burning sensation of the skin and a burning, tearing, and swelling of the eyes. If spray is inhaled, the respiratory tract becomes inflamed resulting in a swelling of the mucous membranes lining the breathing passages and temporarily restricting breathing to short, shallow breaths. A one second burst to the face will cause temporary blindness, choking, coughing, and nausea-disabling your attacker giving you time to escape.

The active ingredient in this spray is Oleoresin Capsicum (O.C.), commonly referred to as red pepper. It is a natural, oily, resin-like substance derived from hot peppers, the same peppers used to make spicy foods hot.

When considering which pepper spray is most effective, one must consider the percentage of pepper being used and the heat rating of that pepper (measured in Scoville Heat Units or S.H.U.). A good pepper sprays has a rating of 2 million S.H.U. or higher...

**Don't be fooled by the claims ""Hottest allowed by law"" and ""Hottest in the industry"" that are made by some on the web. This gives people a false sense of security.**

**Federal law does not allow carrying any type of pepper spray on airplanes or in the security areas of an airport. They are also prohibited on aircraft because the drop in air pressure can cause the pepper spray canisters to explode. For the same reason, pepper spray cannot be shipped by air. **If you're flying, I'll tell/show you how to make your spray ""airplane safe"". Just e-mail me.

Always remember that you assume all risk and liability for owning and using pepper spray. Even if you use it correctly, there is no guarantee that it will always be effective at hindering an attack, and there is always the possibility that it may be used against you instead.

**Consult the laws of your state and/or local agency. Understand and Obey them before owning pepper spray.**

While growing up in Lebanon, Indiana, I baled hay all summer at .03 cents a bale, saved my money and bought the shotgun of my dreams. Being 14 and shooting a single shot 20 gauge my dream shotgun was a Remington Wingmaster 870 in 12 gauge.  Anyhow, I bought the shotgun; probable filled up a couple of truck loads of rabbits, squires and my first deer. While I was in the Army, our home was broken into and lucky for me they left my single shot 20 gauge but did take the Remington. To make a long story short, I’ve been able to “rat hole” $350.00 that the wife doesn’t know about and no one would miss a meal over. If anyone has a Remington 870 Wingmaster that needs a new home please let me know; I’ll take good care of her. No matter if I find another 870 Wingmaster or not, have a great Christmas and please take a moment to remember our sons and daughters who are serving our great country. Like myself, I’m sure there are a few others who spent a few Christmases away from home in one or two “problem area’s” of the world. Depending on your area, the chow that day might have been a little nicer, the friends at the time were probable a lot tighter but missing the family and loved ones was always much worse.

http://www.cabelas.com/product/Shooting/Black-Powder/Pistols-Revolvers%7C/pc/104792580/c/104701680/sc/104503680/Pietta-Model-1858-New-Army-Target-44-Caliber-Revolver/731696.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse.cmd%3FN%3D1100201%26WTz_l%3DSBC%253BBRprd705328&WTz_l=SBC%3BBRprd705328%3Bcat104503680

It's a Pietta (Made in Italy) version of the 1858 New Army Revolver in .44 blackpowder. I've got a super slick matching leather holster and belt that I bought with it that'll fit belt sizes from 30"" - 46"". Truly beautiful setup. This pistola is in BARELY USED condition, always cleaned immediately after firing and set in the holster in the safe every single day. 

The target version is different in the rear sights are full adjustable rather than just a notch. I would plink soda cans out to 50 yards all day with this bad boy. Took a whitetail in MO with it several years ago too! 

New (if you can find them in stock) these are $249 on sale. I paid $75 for the belt and holster when I bought them to a grand total of $325 new if bought today. 

I'd like to get $225 for the setup which I think is an absolute steal. Would rather see it go to someone who actually shoots it or at the very least likes to walk around with it strapped to their hip.

Also, since this isn't technically a ""firearm"" I can ship this to your door, meaning there's no serial number, no background check (when purchased new) and no modern propellants or cartridges involved with firing this bad boy. It's blackpowder (Pyrodex of course) all the way. If you want it shipped, add an extra $15 to the price.

Still, no bad guys. Meetings FTF around I-25 and HWY 34 or the Greeley area. Pics tell the story..."
