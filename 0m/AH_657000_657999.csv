This is a custom high capacity 1911 that was used by Para for the Special Forces trials. Comes with 5 magazines, has trijicon night sights, light rail, skeleton trigger and hammer, full length guide rod. Really an awesome combat pistol. 

I have ran just under 500 rounds through it. For anyone that knows Kimbers or Paras and the like, it takes that or more just to break in a hand gun with as close of tolerances these have. I basically kept bringing it to the range until it would cycle 100 rounds without a stoppage.

This is absolutly an outstanding firearm and the only reason I am selling it is that I have hands that are a little on the small side and prefer a single stack 1911 due to the fact that I have to change my grip to allow my thumb to hit the slide release during a reload.

That being said, I would like around $1,200 since I know it is worth that. Especially in this political climate, but I will negotiate slightly. I will consider trades for a single stack 1911 orand. 45acp carbine only. I really want a Ruger SR1911. No Springfields, Rock Islands.... been there done that.
Would also consider trades for a '70s 350-500cc Jap motorcycle in decent shape. Need not run, but must have good engine. 2 or 4 stroke.

I fired very few rounds through this shotgun.  This shotgun comes with attractive wood furniture and the harder to find 26 in. chrome lined barrel.  This shotgun is the same as the H&R excell auto shotgun.  the bolt is chrome plated and the gun has a magazine cut off as well as 4 different chokes tubes to handle most any hunting situation.  It weighs under 6 3/4 lbs and includes swivel studs for mounting a sling.  I REALLY like this firearm but a few need to be moved on.

Comes with 7 mags, few extra parts, Bushnell red dot and as many original parts as I could salvage (hand guards and FCG - no stock). Contact with questions. Trade value must be $1000 plus. Your P95 is not WORTH the $350 you gave for it brand new a year ago now that it has 500 rounds through it. Your AR with 2000 rounds is NOT worth the $1000 you dropped on it two months ago before your course, however, if you have the right AR (i.e. good quality to include DPMS, Spikes, BCM, etc) then we can trade straight across or I may be able to sweeten the deal for you. If you have an optic, don't expect me to count it as retail, I won't. I'll let you keep it for more than about 30% of original cost because I can get them cheap brand new, no offense intended."

I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees. While doing research early one morning, since sleep eluded me once more and which just so happens to be Veteran's day, (HOOAH!), I stumbled up this website and figured why not?!?

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

If this works, I will definitely use this site again, but for one of those more noble causes I wrote about earlier in this early morning rambling. If you can donate to the cause, please email me via the link below.

Thanks for looking and for your donations.

Both barrel lengths are fitted with integral rails that accept all standard Weaver-style rings for easy scope mounting. This is a pistol that won't easily be outgrown as skills improve.

I'm Dave, a disabled veteran who enjoys target shooting, or as I call it; ""Group Therapy."" I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees. While doing research early one morning, since sleep eluded me once more and which just so happens to be Veteran's day, (HOOAH!), I stumbled up this website and figured why not?!?

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

I'm Dave, a disabled veteran who enjoys target shooting, or as I call it; ""Group Therapy."" I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees. While doing research early one morning, since sleep eluded me once more and which just so happens to be Veteran's day, (HOOAH!), I stumbled up this website and figured why not?!?

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

If this works, I will definitely use this site again, but for one of those more noble causes I wrote about earlier in this early morning rambling. If you can donate to the cause, please email me via the link below.

Thanks for looking and for your donations.

I'm Dave, a disabled veteran who enjoys target shooting, or as I call it; ""Group Therapy."" I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees. While doing research early one morning, since sleep eluded me once more and which just so happens to be Veteran's day, (HOOAH!), I stumbled up this website and figured why not?!?

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

If this works, I will definitely use this site again, but for one of those more noble causes I wrote about earlier in this early morning rambling. If you can donate to the cause, please email me via the link below.

Thanks for looking and for your donations.

If you do a search on the SP2022 you'll find countless references to it as SIG Sauer's best kept secret, but how you can call a pistol that's in use by Military and Police by the tens of thousands across the globe a secret I don't know. Sharing the same pedigree as their Pro line (P226 et al) at half the price makes the SP2022 an excellent buy.

What I'm putting up for trade:

Kahr P9, LNIB, two tone, one mag, in the box with paperwork. Tritium sights, very nice pistol. 

XD40, good condition, maybe 1000 rounds through it. Comes in original box with all the XD gear it came with. Has some holster marks, as I do carry it.  

Savage .17 hmr with BSA Sweet 17 scope. Near mint condition, this rifle will put every round through the same hole at 100. One of my favorite rifles to shoot. 

Sporterized Mauser 8mm, all marks intact, including the Nazi Waffen mark. Has an old 4X scope, will shoot 2"" at 100 with whatever ammo you put in it. No deer has survived a hit from this rifle. 

1954 Marlin 39a .22. Was an attic find, has a little rust, and a broken extractor spring. Shoots straight, and has killed plenty of critters around the farm. 

Few old 12 and 20 single shots, in decent, working order. They just sit in the safe.  

Some misc. reloading supplies. Have a tumbler, some dies, press, old powder measure, etc. LOTS of Lake City brass, .308 and .223, as well as a whole box of sorted misc rounds. 

Come up with what you think is fair. Single item, or a combination. Nothing I posted here is used regularly, I'm ready to wheel and deal. I am NOT looking to add cash at this time. I could go sell a couple items and go buy a new rifle, figured I'd see what anybody has on here first. All laws apply, I have a foid, so should you.

This gun was built in Yugoslavia (Now Serbia) and would make a nice addition to a collection. Would be more than happy to provide specific pictures upon request."

I'm Dave, a disabled veteran who enjoys target shooting, or as I call it; ""Group Therapy."" I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees. While doing research early one morning, since sleep eluded me once more and which just so happens to be Veteran's day, (HOOAH!), I stumbled up this website and figured why not?!?

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

If this works, I will definitely use this site again, but for one of those more noble causes I wrote about earlier in this early morning rambling. If you can donate to the cause, please email me via the link below.

Thanks for looking and for your donations.

I'm Dave, a disabled veteran who enjoys target shooting, or as I call it; ""Group Therapy."" I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees. While doing research early one morning, since sleep eluded me once more and which just so happens to be Veteran's day, (HOOAH!), I stumbled up this website and figured why not?!?

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

I have a Ruger 14 stainless varmint rifle. Has around 2k rounds through it. Barrel has been treated with HBN. It has an ATI Stock, with rail mounted flashlight. It has also had the trigger lightened up and a heavier op rod spring installed. The action is Duracoated a custom color I made. And the stock is camo with a pattern I made to match my father in laws locust tree grove. I have 1 Ruger 30rd mag and three polymer mags that will come with it as well as a single point sling. 

This would make a really good self defense SHTF rifle. I used it mostly to kill ground hogs on my father in laws land. I now have an AR-15 and a custom 17HMR rifle so figure I would sell/trade this to pick up some other stuff I want.

I'm Dave, a disabled veteran who enjoys target shooting, or as I call it; ""Group Therapy."" I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees.

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

The Springfield Model 1892-99 Krag-Jørgensen rifle is a Norwegian-design bolt action rifle that was adopted in 1892 as the standard United States Army military longarm, chambered in U.S. caliber .30-40 Krag. All versions and variants were manufactured under license by the Springfield Armory between 1892 and 1903. The U.S. Krag was replaced beginning in 1903 with the introduction of the M1903 Springfield rifle. The 1896 is amongst the rarer of the Krags, and this is certainly an acceptable example for a collection."

Manurhin P1 9mm semi-auto with 2 mags, flap holster. 
A variation of the the P38, the P1 was one of the world's first true double-action pistol and proved to be an exceptional military pistol. The weapon is robust, accurate and well balanced and field stripping and maintenance are simple and rapid. The P1 uses a double-action trigger design similar to that of the earlier Walther PPKs, and a loaded chamber indicator is also incorporated. The fixed-barrel design mechanism operates by use of a wedge-shaped locking block underneath the breech. The standard safety also acts as a decocker, and is located at the left side of the slide. When German manufacturer Walther was no longer able to produce firearms after World War II thanks to Allied sanctions, they passed the design and materials for the P38 and P1 over to French firearms company Manurhin. This pistol is import-marked and features synthetic grips, fixed open sights, and an 8-round magazine. Its grips, metal, and bore are all in very good condition."
