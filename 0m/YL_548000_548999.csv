Real deal this time. Last buyer flaked and I got burned out on the selling process for a while. 1800 or best offer takes the lot. I know the price might seem up there but this is an out of production SBR-ready rifle by Arsenal I haven't seen one actually sell for less than this in over a year: 

http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=320767915

Super-rare, high quality rifle from Arsenal, just begging to be SBR'd. I've had it for about 2 years and put MAYBE 200 rounds through it the whole time I've had it. It's a slick little gun but it just doesn't get that much love from me because my range time is usually dedicated to my build projects or handgun work. 

This gun is actually appreciating in value at a pretty steady rate, but I'm a project guy. I'd rather have some guns to tinker with than a pretty one that just sits in the safe, and really a fine machine like this should go to somebody who will actually fire it. At this point I'm just fielding offers to see if anybody is interested before the election makes everybody crazy. I'm happy to make a deal but I'm not in a rush to get rid of it. 

I prefer face to face but shipping is an option provided your FFL accepts transfers from private sellers."

Description: 5.11 Tactical and Blade-tech (www.Blade-tech.com) have joined forces to bring you the revolution line of holsters. Using a proprietary blend of polymers, Blade-Tech has engineered these holsters to offer lifetime performance in a wide range of conditions. The holsters won’t become soft in extreme temperatures (over 300º F) and won’t become fragile in low temperatures. We’re using a special slick-surface polymer, one that won’t wear the finish of your gun like a leather holster. Revolution holsters provide a level 1 retention. When inserted into the holster, your sidearm seats positively with an audible ‘click’. Retention screws may be tightened or loosened for personal preference. Holsters come with a belt-loop (adjustable for a 1” to 2 1/4” belt) plus a paddle that can be adjusted for angle. Our holsters also come with a paddle, which makes this great deal a tremendous value. Paddle can be adjusted for belt width and holster cant. Because we use an proprietary polymer, our holsters have much higher temperature tolerance. Other holsters can deform or even melt at much lower temperatures than the 5.11/Blade-Tech Revolution holsters. Not yet rated Leave a comment: Please do your best to keep the comments on topic.

The pistol has a 4"" match grade bull barrel with a fully supported ramp. The trigger is match grade as well, with a trigger pull weight of 4.5 lbs with a 7.5"" overall length. An ambidextrous safety allows right and left handed shooters to operated the lever easily. This 1911 pistol is equipped with a trigger locking device. A key inserted into a hole in the rear grip strap positively locks the trigger, making it impossible for a child to accidentally discharge the gun.

The upper and the hand guard meet to form one complete upper rail, and the Troy 13” rail runs all the way down the barrel leaving 2” of ss barrel and the flash hider exposed, this gives it a very tough look. The pistol grip is an ergo rubber grip that feels wonderful in the hand. Now I went with an ATI polymer lower receiver, to cut down on the weight but I installed a spikes parts kit. The stock is a six position magpul. I did not install any optics because I did not get that far, and lets face it everyone likes something different, but I can install one if needed. I have all the receipts for everything. Im asking $1350 or best offer for this awesome brand new ar15, and I will consider partial trades for hand guns + cash.

The rifle was made around the 1960's, it's a bolt action single-shot rifle.
Whats interesting is that it was sold by Sears and Roebuck, it says so right on the barrel.

It's perfect for a training rifle, varmint gun or youth rifle.
It's in good shape, the finish is a bit worn but the action works fine and the wood is in good shape. 
It shoots short, long and long rifle rounds. It eats the cheap stuff fine (in my experience)

I'd prefer to trade, but I'll take cash too."

Yes

How many shots has it fired?

I do not know. I shot it less than 200 times..

Does it lock tightly?

Yes. If you look closely at the locking lugs, you can see that there is little wear on those. It opens much easier than a new 682, of course.

All the work on the rifle was done before I acquired it and I do not know the story of the rifle.

It looks to me like the gun was built as a benchrest rifle, it has been fiberglass bedded around the action and the full length of the stock that touches the barrel.
The barrel is a little over 25 inches long... The safety has been swapped out with a Mark II safety... Weaver scope mounts have been fitted to the action... Bolt has been bent.... Follower has been modified to close on empty chamber.... Hand checkered wooden right hand stock..

I purchased it new approximately ten years ago from Scheels Sporting Goods in St. Cloud, Minnesota. I got it on sale for $279. 

It's had ONE range visit (Del Tone Range St. Cloud) with one tube of ammo fired through it. It performed flawlessly. I bought it as a gift for my then 10-year-old son but his (and my) springs and summers have been consumed with baseball. The gun's been kept in its original box and cleaned with Break Free CLP every year. 

It comes in a box with the receipt stapled to the lifetime warranty card.

Other online listings indicate this gun, in the carbine, is ""rare."" I don't know whether it is or not, but the $180 would cover the psychology college textbook I purchased for my son today."

There are springs in the recoil reducing version. You can see the spring in the grip.

2) How do you know this particular example isn't made of solid titanium and forged in the fires of Mordor by the 12 greatest master-smiths who ever lived?

This is a hard to find Italian shotgun nowadays as it’s no longer imported to the United States.

History on it: 1998 H&K severs business relations with Benelli and begins importing the Italian made Fabarms shotguns in its place. 

Notable Features:

-Lightweight Ergal 55 alloy receiver

-Tribore barrel - a deep-drilled, machined barrel with three separate internal bore profiles. Beginning at the chamber and forcing cone, the bore is enlarged to .7401"" to soften recoil while the second profile is in the middle of the barrel gradually choking down to .7244"" to emulate a cylinder bore profile to increase velocity.

- Factory heatshield

Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler...och_FABARM_FP6

My FP6 comes with the following:

-The FP6 itself

-Choke wrench

-Choate 2 shot tube extension 

- Factory Fabarms Foregrip and 2 shot extention tube, these both need a tiny modification to work, I have the diagrams and instructions necessary to make them work. 

-Original tube cap and spring along with spare barrel/mag tube clamp

Round count by me is about < (less than) 300."
