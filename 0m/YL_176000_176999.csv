Thats about it for the most part. There is probably some other odds and ends I am forgetting. I should have most or at least alot of the reciepts for these parts, labor, and service laying around here. The suspension and motorswap was done by Slowmotion Motorsports out of Columbus. 

The car is riding on steelies with some pretty used tires, should likely be replaced within the next 6 months depending on how much its driven. If I get asking price or the trade is lucrative I will add in four new tires mounted on 15' Konig rims (white with red lip). However I have 3/4 rims. But an entire set of tires. I just haven't ordered the replacement rim yet. I purchased these over the winter for a good price and the seller did not reveal that one of the rims was damaged. 

As for the bad. The interior door panels need new clips and the door handles need replaced as they have broken. The exterior could really use some refinishing, the clear coat is peeled off rather bad and could just use some TLC. The only mechanical issue is the transmission has trouble grabbing second gear, I believe. I was told it was actually likely just the shifter bushings but I haven't the slightest clue."

I can take as many suggestions as people throw out there, (and I love more suggestions) but It all comes down to my preference. What I am looking for is someone who has a G27 that wouldn't mind me dropping 50 rounds through in order to get a feel for it. I've shot the 26 and have a feel for it.

I have a nice Kahr CW45 for trade only. I bought this pistol about a month ago as a summer carry weapon. It felt pretty good, but not as small as I'd like. I'm a fairly thin guy so concealing without printing is tough for me. I recently tried and bought an S&W 642 that is extremely comfortable so now I have no practical use for my Kahr. It has never had any FTF's, FTE's or any other kind of hiccups at all. It has exactly 182 rounds through it, including 7 hollow points. I have the gun, the original case and paperwork, a Blackhawk nylon IWB holster and two extra Kahr mags. I'm looking to trade for a full size .45 pistol or a .357 magnum revolver with a 3 or 4 inch barrel. I have cash, a few low end rifles or other merch to balance out a trade if necessary.

By the way, I have no interest in any guns from Hi Point, Keltec or Taurus."

Serial number has been checked. (2384130) Looks to be a re-import as well, was re-imported by Blue Sky out of Arlington VA.

This rifle is in about 90-95% shape. Has not been ""restored"" or any of the parts changed out on it. Has original sling and oiler. Stock shows signs of wear and tear of course. There are some chips, dents and dings, but nothing that stops this rifle from working beautifully. I have shot this rifle regularly and had 0 issues with it. Actually it is a very accurate shooter. Has adjustable sights (wind-age and distance) comes with a bayonet lug as well. 

Comes with 2 30 round magazines. (1 original, and 1 I bought so I have a spare)

Have 10 unfired rounds, and some fired brass that goes along with the gun as well.

Only reason I am selling the gun is that I want to finish building an AR I have started, and I need some money. Unfortunately this is the only gun I have I don't shoot on a regular basis, so instead of sitting on a shelf, I am putting it up for sale.

7.62x38R caliber (Also will shoot .32S&W Long.) .32ACP replacment cylinders can be installed. 20rds of original ammo comes with it.
This is a unique design as the cylinder moves forward as the hammer is cocked thus creating a gas seal therefore giving extra fps ballistically and also making it suppressor capable.
 Loads like a single action but shoots double/single action. Date marked 1944. Unissused and unfired untill I fired 30rounds through it in 2011.

Original Post:
Parker Hale M82, Sniper, 7.62 nato, Heavy Barrel , I bought this from the original Gibbs Rifle company when they bought all the Parker Hale rifles ect. This is an early M82 with a Parker Hale round top receiver, later models were flat top styles, also later ones used hardwood stocks, this one has an English walnut,
Fully Adjustable trigger, (Not a Parker Hale)
Excellent bore in barrel,,1 - 12"" Twist made out of chrome molybdenum steel.
comes with the stock spacers as seen in pic
Scope not original as it didn't come with a scope when I bought it,
Recoil pad not original, as the PH pad is old and cracked but it's included in the deal
It has British black finish(Paint) on the metal
Uses a Mauser 98 action
I have some Nato ammo for it
It weights about 12lbs
These were in British service from 1972-2003
no sights on this rifle except the scope

I saw one of the late M82's at the last Ohio Gun Collectors for $4600, I paid $2600 back many years ago

I can meet evenings and weekends in the Noblesville area and during the lunch hour around the Castleton area. Here is the MTM description:

MTM ammo cans are a great way to store bulk or boxed ammo. Its all plastic design is lighter in weight than the 50 caliber US Military Surplus Ammo Can. Transferring ammo to and from the range, just became a little easier! Ideal for ammo storage.

Molded out of rugged polypropylene plastic, these comfortably handled ammo cans will hold up to some pretty harsh treatment. Utilizing MTM's tongue and groove O-Ring seal system for a superior water-resistant seal, the 50 caliber can is designed to fit the same amount of bulk ammo storage as the original. A heavy-duty dual latching system makes for a better seal and less likely to open accidentally. Double padlock tabs along with molded-in stacking ridges, make these solid containers the perfect solution to so many storage needs.

Weight: 1.76 Pounds. The 50 cal military metal can weighes 5.30 pounds or 300% heavier empty.

Inside Dim: 5.8”(L) x 11.0”(W) x 7.2”(H)

Outside Dim: 7.4”(L) x 13.5”(W) x 8.5”(H)
