He lived in the baddest part of town and kept a thirty-two gun in his pocket for fun.  Well with its pearl grips and nickel plating, this would have been a thirty-two gun to LeRoy's taste.

This is a .32 Hand Ejector Model of 1903 Fourth Change made between 1910 and 1917, just in advance of the Roarin' Twenties.   It has a 3-1/4 inch barrel, the shortest barrel in the Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson for this model, so it would have made an appropriate pocket gun.  

I'm not a dealer, just a dedicated collector and this gun was part of a multi-gun lot I acquired early last year.  It really doesn't fit my collection, so I'm trying to find it a new home.   The good news is that the gun works perfectly.  I've put a couple boxes of .32 long through it and it is spot-on accurate and works well in single and double action.  The less good news is that the nickel finish isn't quite pristine, and the price reflects both the guns utility and the current finish.   

When I first handled the gun I thought it was a candidate for rebluing.  Only after removing the grips did I realize it was plated and had spots of tarnish or oxidation as if the gun had spent decades in a glove box.  I carefully cleaned the gun and the solvent removed a lot of lint and soot from the inside of the gun (LeRoy had dirty pockets!).   

After a few applications of Simichrome polish the spots reduced in size, but haven't gone away completely.  While the finish needs work, the bore/lands/grooves are just fine.  Perhaps the new owner can further brighten the finish or enjoy the gun now as a novel backup and treat it as a candidate for future restoration.

Face to face sale is not possible, but I’ll pack/insure/ship for the lower 48 for $22.  Personal check is fine, and I’ll need a SIGNED copy of an FFL or (or C&R license where allowed) and ship to the address on the license.

Here is the ultimate setup for close to midrange tactical. The Eotech 552 with NVG compatibility button. This is the Rev F. with the easy to find AA battery source. Rev F. is the latest longest lasting battery model. Has the 4 or 8 hour auto shutoff, and can run continuous on one set of batteries for a month. It is on a GG&G cam mount which will easily attach or dethatch from any 1913 picatinny rail. Also has the GG&G lens covers to keep your optic safe and scratch free. These Eotechs are parallax free heads up weapons sights. No matter where the dot is in the large field of view window your point of impact will not be affected, very high speed shooting device. The Aimpoint 3X magnifier is a real one, I have included pictures of the bottom and serial number so you can contact Aimpoint to verify this. It is the best there is. It co-witnesses perfectly with the Eotech and gives medium range efficiency. This unit doubles as a monocular by simply removing it. It has the patented twist mount, so with the push of a lever and 30 degree rotation you can remove it and be back to a strait 1X Eotech for close quarters. I am looking to sell or preferably trade, I want to go long range and need a high end scope. I would like Leupold but may consider others. It has to be in the same value area, I paid over $1100 for this setup in the last couple years. I have more stuff or money to add to the right deal. Thanks for the look."

Taking offers..

Any AR style weapons have went up greatly in price. Ive had numerous offers on it.. would prefer cash, but will look at trades also. If lowball will be ignored. These were between 500-600 before this whole mess started. So it will take a bit more for me to sell. Considering these mags are selling for 50$-60$ each and i have 2. 
Thanks.."

Face to face is preferred but I can ship to your doorstep anywhere in the US where this upper receiver is not expressly prohibited by law. Item will only be shipped to a Paypal confirmed shipping address and will be fully insured and require signature. This is not a firearm, so no FFL is required. It is legal for you to purchase this upper but you need either an AR15 pistol or SBR to put it on. If you don't already have one you can buy this now and send in your paperwork to get your $200 tax stamp from the ATF but can not assemble it until it comes back.

I would love to trade for a decent pistol. Im open to ALL offers. Even offers other than pistols.
The rims are 14"". 4x114 lug pattern. 0 offset. 6.5 wide in the front and 7 wide in the rear. They are rare rims because they have to be shipped from Japan. Watanabe doesn't have a factory in America. They would usually be more expensive also but I am hoping for a quick trade or sale. The rims are dusty in the picture so the picture doesn't do them any justice. They are a lot nicer in person.
Trade offers Im open to- will consider ANY pistol offers, no matter if its a semi or a revolver. Im not picky about make or model. Just want to see whats out there. Would also like a GSG .22LR or any other tactical .22LR but will listen to any other rifle offers also. Don't need a shotgun unless its a tactical style.

It comes with both the leapers scope and the brand new red dot, the firefield red laser with mount, the stock grip, tan grip to match the furniture, and the olive sniper grip, the installed quad rail with the tan ladders, the tan adjustable stock, as well as the black stock, 10 20 rnd mags (yes ten of them), one 30 round metal mag, and the tan 30 round countdown mag. The countdown mag shows you how many rounds are remaining in it.  I'm sure I have forgotten some of the extras I will throw in, but it includes everything pictured plus more spare parts. I never imagined selling this gun, so I have used it as my gun. There are a few scratches here and there from use, but nothing major. 

I am super firm at $1600. I have lowered my price. I'm tired of haggling. I will let it go for cash only. No trades. If I don't sell it, I will keep it. I've had a ton of offers for trades and lowball cash, but it would take $1600 to buy this. Don't mean to be rude but I had about 25 trade offers yesterday and I can't think straight this morning. The only trade offer I would consider is another AR. I would take an ar10 if someone really wanted to get back to a 5.56, or I would take a cheap AR as a partial trade, like a stock dpms or something. That's it.  No other trade offers please. 


BUYER MUST BE WILLING TO SIGN A BILL OF SALE, AND SHOW ID AND SIGN ALL INFO I ASK FOR (name, telephone number, address, etc). I WILL GIVE A COPY TO THE BUYER AS WELL. THIS IS DONE TO PROTECT BOTH OF US.

Kel-Tec info: 

The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal Silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

I am the original owner of the gun and haven't shot it that much. I love the gun but, I just bought the same gun in a trap combo! I tried to take as good of pictures I could, but I'm a horrible photographer. The only mentionable spot on the gun is a small nick on the top of the rib about an inch behind the mid-bead that I did manage to get a decent picture of. Picture size is really limited on here, so if serious please contact me and I will send a link to better pics.

The beautiful comb adjustable stock shown in the photos is from Great American Gunstocks in Marysville California, and the original field grade factory stock is also included. This comes with a bag full of beretta spares including springs and other common items, but nothing special in those parts.

With the stock and bufers the recoil on this shotgun is reduced to the point where it feels like you'te shooting a staple gun.  A case of 250 rounds at the trap range is no longer a shoulder beater, but now becomes routine. This gun shoots way better than I do but I havent been to a trap range in years so it's time to pass it on to somebody who will appreciate it.

In field grades, these sell for $400 to 600 both locally and online
With the stock ($350) and the buffers installed, I'll sell this one for $850 or trade for a good name compact or subcompact 9, 40 or 45 with some cash to balance it out.    ID required, CPL preferred."
