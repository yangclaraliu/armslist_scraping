Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Scope with Chevron BAC Flattop Reticle TA31F includes Trijicon TA51 Flat Top Adapter. The chevron reticle of the Trijicon Gun Sight is designed to be zeroed using imagethe tip at 100 meters. The width of the chevron at the base is 5.53 MOA which is 19"" at 300 meters. This allows range estimation for silhouette targets. Trijicon TA31F ACOG 4x32 Scope with Chevron BAC Flattop Reticle features Dual Illumination (Fiber Optic provides daylight illumination and tritium illuminates reticle at night). The ranging reticle is calibrated for 5.56mm (.223 cal) flat-top rifles out to 800 meters. Trijicon TA-31F 4 x 32mm ACOG Advanced Combat Optical Gunsights hit fast in any light. Trijicon ACOG 4 x 32 Riflescopes are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Bind on Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using fiber optics which collect ambient light. Trijicon 4x32 ACOGs combine traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. Although Trijicon ACOG 4 x 32 Rifle Scopes TA31-F have many features which are very advantageous for military use, they were developed by Trijicon without government funding. Designed for use with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions - without failure-prone batteries."

I have put about 50 trouble free rounds through this gun. It shoots great and is accurate with the sig night sites and or the laser.  It would make a nice concealed carry gun. It has a long trigger pull so don't have to worry about accidental discharges and you can make sure you really want to fire it before it goes off. The included holster covers the trigger nicely and holds the gun securely with or without the laser attached. 
I don't really want to sell this but I can not justify keeping it right now.

This is an incredibly unique rifle. I had seen them in parades and at funerals firing salutes… but never for sale. It is as the government turned it loose. It has a tag on it that says it has a good headspace and the armorer signed it. I have a certificate of authenticity on it. 


I need to qualify though, it is not as it was created… They have redone these for ceremonial rifles… shortening them and chroming them. Now, if you did that it would ruin the value… if the government does that it becomes a rare specialty gun. 

Note that this gun has no front sights. When they toss them around apparently the sights are in the way. You don’t need to aim if you are shooting blanks. 

The rifling is in good shape.   This gun is fun to shoot... A warrior that is over 100 years old and will still sit a deer down right now! 

Deep down you know that this is a bargain. A decent looking Krag goes for $1400 unless someone has altered it… this one is certified authentic. The certificate goes with it. 

These things are just flat gorgeous! 

They obviously show the dings of use in parades and wherever else they have been. Look at the pics carefully."

The Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder than hard chrome. 

The 5.45x39 caliber bullet matches high muzzle velocity with excellent sectional density, resulting in a flat trajectory and good penetration. The standard ball cartridge will penetrate 5mm of steel plate at a distance of 350 meters. The lowered recoil impulse of the 5.45mm cartridge (verses the 7.62x39mm) has a beneficial effect on accuracy. The 5.45x39mm cartridge is an excellent round that offers comparable penetration, accuracy and lethality to anything fielded by NATO. More importantly, 5.45x39 ammunition is less expensive to shoot! This rifle has been designed to handle dirty and corrosive surplus ammunition. The bolt and bolt carrier have been protected by an ion-bond finish. These processes make the parts corrosive resistant. Now you have the ability to shoot the inexpensive corrosive mil-surplus ammo without the fear of the parts being unduly worn. 

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical tooling dimensions held within ±.001"" and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control."

We set up payplans if you want to put something on lay-a-way. We just require a small down payment and monthly payment.

We also take trades. We realize its tough to get every gun you want so if you can't afford to buy it outright right now we are happy to swap you some of our collection for some of yours. Just let us know the details of what you have to trade and we will go from there.

If you have questions you can email us directly at Justin@darcopsarmory.com or use the gunbroker ""Ask Seller a Question"" feature.

This item is new, we are a licensed gun shop and we received it from the manufacturer or a distributor. It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public. This usually means you will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened.

Hello and thank you for checking out our auction. Up for auction is a brand new NightHawk Custom Remington 870 12ga Police Magnum Tactical pump shotgun. This beast is loaded with every option needed for on the job LE work or just home defense. This 870 has Ghost Ring rear sights and red fiber optic front sight, collapsible stock with recoil reducer, side saddle, Van Comp system, Surefire forend, and a true action job to make a smoother more reliable functioning shotgun by the guys at NightHawk Custom.

When things go bump in the night nothing settles your nerves more than having a shotgun nearby that you know tips the odds in your favor.

Law enforcement professionals already know that when they deploy a shotgun, suspects carrying a handgun are not nearly so emboldened about starting a gunfight. It's very intimidating to think that you might be on the receiving end of the lethal blast that a shotgun delivers.

More patrol officers are carrying AR-type rifles in their squad cars but are discovering that, if setup properly, a 12 gauge can deliver a 300 grain slug with combat accuracy up to 100 yards with devastating results that no rifle can match. This can be achieved while carrying munitions that range from buckshot to breeching rounds to less lethal, all with the same weapon. The bottom line is that the shotgun has proven itself to be the most intimidating, effective and versatile of any weapon deployed in an urban environment.

We specialize in setting up combat shotguns. Whether you are a civilian wanting an optimal home defense weapon, or a law enforcement professional with special needs, we can provide you the complete package.

Things we consider when setting up your shotgun:

SIGHTS
We use the same sights as the United States military. They feature fully adjustable ghost ring apertures that are adjustable for elevation and windage. Front and rear are fully shrouded for protection against being knocked out of adjustment or damaged if dropped. This 870 has a front dot Night Sight so you will always know you sight picture.

SIDE SADDLE
Ideal for carrying specialized or spare rounds– six round configuration

SHOTSHELL CARRIERS

Probably the first thing you will notice after you admire the finish is our side shell carrier. We say that because there is no need to remove it to read the serial numbers. It is made from a one piece aluminum billet that is hard anodized to military spec. (no more fear of plastic cracking if left in direct sunlight). This one is asix round configurations.

SAFETY
Rapid release of the safety can sometimes make the critical difference. We use the Vang Comp Big Dome Safety on all of our models. The dome on the safety is so pronounced that you can release the safety while acquiring the trigger in the same move.

ACTION
A smooth action is essential for fast follow up shots. Not content to leave ""as is out of the box"", we hand-hone every action for smoother operation.

OPTIONAL PICATINNY RAIL FOR RED DOT SIGHTS:
A Picatinny Rail can be mounted on the receiver which allows you to facilitate the use of various red dot sights. Combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have proven that the use of a red-dot aiming device is the fastest way to acquire a target.

VANG COMP SYSTEM
Normally a $250 option, the Vang Comp System, or VCS, is a patented process whereby the barrel is ported, back-bored and the forcing cone is lengthened to reduce felt recoil and tighten an optimize buck shot loads.

Standard Base Model Features

Our Nighthawk Tactical Shotgun base model includes the following features:
Remington 870 3"" Magnum
Hand honed action for smoother, faster operation
Proprietary Ceramic Based Perma Kote™ finish in Black

Shipping/handling is going to be $45 and insurance will be added at 1.75% of the item's value to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping. The price is for certified funds. a credit card will add 5% to the price.

This rifle is a hybrid, the entire upper receiver/assembly is a Vietnam-era Colt A1 , with 20"" chrome lined barrel with 1:12 twist, and vintage tri-guard foregrip. The lower receiver is a complete,all-original Rock River assembly.
Several years ago, a couple companies like CDNN and CheaperThanDirt got a hold of some brand new Colt recievers that were manufactured back in the 70's, and these predicatbly sold out very quickly,and I was lucky enough to get one before they disappeared forever. I then shopped around, and went with a fully assembled lower from Rock River.( So,yes, I am the original owner.)
This is an excellent rifle, in pristine condition, with maybe 300 flawless rounds through it. If any serious buyers have a safe,convenient place to shoot, I have no problems with a test fire, this gun is a rock-solid, high quality AR. 
Included is the military-issue butt-stock cleaning kit, 4 30-round magazines, military magazine pouch, and standard military issue black nylon sling.
No interest in trades, and this is for sale only to Georgia residents with valid ID ( unless you want to pay for the FFL transfer on the Alabama side, then that works,too.)
Sometimes the price is negotiable, but sorry, not on this one. $850,firm.

P.S. Please, no more calls from out-of-state buyers, I'd prefer to avoid the headache of shipping, unless maybe a month goes by add it still hasnt sold, then I may consider it. thanks"

Take a ride on the GSX-R600 and you'll quickly become aware of a highly developed sporting tool. On a particular solo run on the Gixxer, the man/machine interface was direct and inspirational, not wanting of a dollop more power or a scintilla of a quicker flick. Its available power is plentiful and the gearbox and slipper clutch works seamlessly at the command of your fingers and toes. The twisty road ahead is consumed to the accompaniment of a beautiful scream from the injected Four. It's difficult to imagine an experience much better.

The 5.11 Tactical Series TDU Ripstop Pants are the new standard and replacement of the old style BDU. Designed with today's law enforcement or security force in mind, these pants have all the features officers want and need. Over a year of product development went into the design of these pants using input from police officers, special operations operators, and military personnel. The result is a new industry standard in BDU style pants.
Made of tough, polyester/cotton Ripstop, 5.11 Tactical Series TDU Ripstop Pants stand up to the rigors of patrol and special operations. These pants feature a self-adjusting comfort waistband to help you bend and stretch with ease. The front pockets of the TDU Pants are strong and roomy; the large side pockets are designed with an added inside pocket containing a divider allowing each side to hold two AR mags securely. Each pocket is lined with the Back-Up Belt System loop-sided carrier which allows the attachment of Back-Up Belt System pouches. Two rear pockets round out the storage needs of almost any duty assignment.

5.11 Tactical Series TDU Ripstop Pants utilize 65%polyester/35% cotton ripstop material that resists tearing and abrasion. The TDU Pants are triple-stitched and bartacked in all stress areas. Constructed with genuine, locking-flange YKK zippers and quality PRYM snaps stay zipped and snapped even under the most strenuous activities. 5.11 Tactical Series TDU Ripstop Pants feature a self-adjusting waist band and blousing straps."

Serial #195 series

I have everything that came with the gun: scope rings, 5 rd magazine, and manual.
Comes with an additional brand new Ruger OEM black synthetic stock.  Not a scratch or ding on it.  The rifle is used, but in very good condition.  Very clean. No rust, abuse or field use.  I've only shot this gun at the range and have cleaned it after every use.  The wood stock has light scratches and pressure dings here and there just from normal range use but is completely structurally sound.  The trigger and accuracy are exceptional.  I also have on hand but never needed it, an extra OEM extractor claw that I'll throw in with the package.  
$525

I also have five new Ruger factory OEM 20 round magazines for this rifle.  Three are still in the package and I took two out and ran them in the gun for the day and they worked flawlessly.  The two open mags that I did use show little or no use at all on the feed lips.
There's a few companies out there that make aftermarket mags for the Mini 14 and they simply don't work reliably like the ""real deal"".  These mags are very hard to come by, especially here in Kalifornia.  Legally, I will have to sell them to you as a ""parts kit"" which entails a simple disassembly of the magazine.  Legally, you can use those parts kits to repair or replace worn out parts on Ruger magazines that you've owned prior to the 2000 assault weapons ban. These magazines that I'm selling have no mfg date on them to show when they were made.
$40 per mag.  or $175 for all five if you buy the gun.  

I think that in these times and the recent events that have unfortunately occurred, our gun rights may be in danger, especially here in Kalifornia.  Semi-automatic firearms and high capacity magazines could very well be further legislated or banned outright.
Nothing like that would shock me anymore.  The time to buy what you may not be able to is now.

I've done a lot of research and feel that the prices I've posted for my rifle, the extras and especially the magazines are very reasonable.

$700 for everything.

It has been very well cared for and preserved. The bluing is still bright and shows very little wear or signs of handling.
All the wood and finishing is flawless. There is not a scratch or nick to be found anywhere. The checkering is also perfect. The shell tube shows very little wear from any cocking action.  There is a small 2x3mm blemish on the right side of the barrel (see photo).  The barrel bore is clean and mirror-like.  The recoil pad is marked Jostam MFG.Co.  It is solid and without cracks or splits. 
The overall condition and appearance is really impressive for a nearly 100 year old gun. I really don’t think this shotgun saw much field action.

We produced rifles to arm the Brits before we got into the war, and marking these as belonging to the U.S. government allowed them to keep up the illusion that we were just lending them weapons.

The No. 4 Mk1* was a simplified version of the regular No. 4 Mk1, designed to allow faster production.  The regular 4-groove barrel was replaced with a 2-groove, the micrometer sight was replaced with a simple L-shaped 300/600 meter flip sight, and the bolt release mechanism was also simplified.

This particular rifle is not wearing the original wood - that was all in bad shape when I acquired it, so it has been replaced.  Serial numbers match on the bolt, receiver, and magazine.  The finish on the metal has mostly turned brown over the years.  The bore is in pretty good shape, there's some debris in the grooves and a little wear but it shoots just fine. 

I would like to get $300 for it.  I bought it for quite a bit less, but I've invested a lot in restoring it from it's previous sporterized state.  This isn't a pristine Enfield, but those are nearly impossible to find these days unless you're willing to spend $700-$800.  If you're just looking for a rifle in decent shape that's a good shooter this is for you."

The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members.

The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard.

the value of the 4wheeler is $3,000...but I'm willing to take most offers, as long as they arent lowballing me to death, cause that really will just piss me off to be honest..be fair to me, and I will be fair to you..

this thing is like new, in perfect condition..it has less than 15 hours on it..

the only thing ""wrong"" wiith it, is that it was in storage for 2 years, just sitting there..and the brushes in the started got hung up, so the electric start doesnt work (it will sometimes after youve been riding for a while? and also if you tap on the starter while trying to crank it) , but it has a pull rope, and it cranks up every single time on the first try...

a new starter will cost you $50.

'armed security service' Weapons of that time, even the ones produced for the Germans, bore the punch mark 4UT, (Quarto Ufficio tecnico di Controllo Armi e Munizioni--4th Technnical Control Unit...
-an C. Still, in Axis Pistols, page 107, states,
""It is likely that almost all of the 4/UT, ...were used by the German Army"". He also includes two other variations in this statement, ""1944 dated and blank slide Model 1935"".
Ugo Menchini, in Pietro Beretta Le Automatiche, regarding an M1934, page 255, states,
""In late 1940 there appears an oval including the punch mark IVU. It refers to the 4th technical Control Unit of the FAG, where inspection was carried out.""
Note that, while they seem to represent the same inspectors, the ""IVU"" is not the same mark as the ""4UT"". The IVU would be found on the pre RSI model M1934, and the 4UT would be found on the RSI model M1935.
These are the reasons why I believe that it is likely that all of the 4UT Berettas WERE RSI pistols!! the IVU and the 4UT were the same office, but under Italian management -the IVU, before the surrender of Italy, and German the 4UT, so after september, 8 1943.........

Mussolini was rescued by German paratroopers led by Otto Skorzeny. He was then installed by the Germans as the President of the Italian Social Republic (RSI). The RSI was to be an Italian regime which was to nominally administer the German-occupied northern Italy. As the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale (MVSN, also known as ""Black Shirts"") was disbanded by the terms of the armistice, the Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana was formed on 24 November 1943. The ""Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana"" was formed out of local police, ex-army, and others still loyal to the fascist cause.
