- Aluminum quad rail
- Low profile gas block (Yours must as well - ie no front sight post)
- 1/9 twist (perfect for a 223 round)
- Magpull angled forgrip
- Grip Pod (not a cheap chinese knock off either)

- Magpull rail covers
- Standard Carbine handgaurds (2 sets)

Upper has been very well taken care of and I expect the same. I have only put around 500 rds through it and it is in like new condition (500 rds is nothing on modern weapons). I am simply looking for more of a target set up than a stand and shoot/tactical set up. I am not willing to pay ridiculous prices. I clearly already have an AR so I am in no rush.

The barrel is also marked ""Saginaw"" and other markings are shown on bolt, Bayonet Lug etc that I do not know.  This rifle is shown in the M1A1 Paratrooper stock however I understand that this would not have been original to the rifle as SAGINAW did not make M1A1's.

The bore on this rifle is in excellent condition and overall fit and finish on this carbine is just as nice, especially for its age.

Feel free to ask any questions and contact me below if you need any additional pictures.

I am not really looking to trade however if you have a trade + $650 Cash I may consider.  Carbines this nice are getting harder and harder to find.  Don't forget that this does take THE DREDDED 30RND MAGAZINES!!!  So get them while you can.  Thanks!

The Brann is everything you are looking for in a tactical carbine. The carbine length direct impingement gas system is a tried and true operating system that has been used by our armed forces for decades. The gas tube is treated with melonite for extra corrosion resistance and reliability. The bolt carrier is an M16 weight carrier made from 8620 steel and is finished inside and out with Adams Arms patent pending lifecoat. Lifecoat is a superior treatment to hardened chrome and parkerizing offering excellent surface hardness, corrosion resistance and durability. The gas key is heat treated, finished in lifecoat inside and out, and is attached to the carrier with Grade 8 fasteners manufactured in the US and properly staked. The bolt is manufactured from proper Mil-spec Carpenter No. 158 steel, magnetic particle inspected, and carbine extractor spring, insert, and Crane O-ring.

The upper and lower receiver are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical dimensions held within +-.001 and type III hard coat finished. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control. The front sight base is An F Marked base, so the height of the base will match perfectly with rear sights mounted on the upper receiver, allowing you to sight in without the addition of an extended lenght front sight post. The front sigh base is also pinned for durability and the barrel is also finished under the front sight base.

Brand new never fired. Complete Lower for AR-15 .223/5.56 NATO by New Frontier. Email or text REDACTED $400 cash only. I purchased this in early Jan in my efforts to build an AR and then found a reasonable deal on a complete AR. I paid 400 so im not trying to overcharge i overpaid just like everyone else is right now. Not to mention i drove to lexington for it and paid for fuel. I dont need it id like to get my investment back and if i cant get 400 i guess i will just keep it and build a lightweight AR if prices ever come down.  If you buy the lower for 400 without hassling me i will offer you one 20 round mag with 20 rounds of .223 loaded in it for an additional 10 dollars. Considering what thats going for right now that is a good deal. Thanks for looking.

Thank you for looking.  Please no email about your opinions on price.  I really don't need or care to hear about what a great price your cousin's neighbor found at a gun store in whatever city.  If there is some great deal you know about, then buy it.  If my price isn't right for you, then simply move on.  If you want a new, quality firearm with the privacy of a transaction with another private citizen, then this might be the firearm for you.

For sale or will trade for a nice AR-15, brand new unfired Molot Vepr 12 12ga tactical shotgun with a 5 rnd mag and box. If you're not familiar with the Vepr 12, it's a better version of a converted SAIGA 12 semi auto 12ga shotgun that accepts the 5, 8, 10 and 12 round magazines. Basically, it has a superior build quality over a saiga 12  that has been converted but comes stock already with:

-Original Polymer Lower Hand Guard 
-Original Polymer Upper Hand Guard 
-Last Round Bolt Hold Open 
-Hinged Dust Cover With Picatinny Rail 
-Machined Bolt Assembly, Gas Block ect. (Not cast like other AK shotguns) 
-Molot Original Polymer Pistol Grip
-(Grade II) Wood Stock 
-Competition AR-15 style Magazine Well (so you don't have to worry about rocking and locking the mag)
-One Molot Factory (5) Round Magazine 
-Factory AK Adjustable Rear Sight 
-Self-Regulating Gas System (which the saiga 12 lacks is a automatic adjusting gas system which means you don't have to adjust when shooting different 12ga loads (will cycle anything)
-AK Enhanced Safety Lever, Single Finger Operation 
-18"" Chrome Lined Barrel, Chamber, Receiver Shaft, and Gas Chamber 
-Threaded Barrel (Thread Patten is the same as Saiga Shotguns)  

 They are EXTREMELY rare guns. Molot initally only imported 1000 into the states a month or two back. This will be no longer available if the assault ban goes in affect!

No feeding issues or any other problems. if you're expecting Glock quality you will be disappointed as these are not at the same level of quality as Glock factory mags (they're 100% polymer, no metal lining), but they work perfectly fine and won't ruin your mag catch since they're all plastic. These are a hot commodity because they're pre-ban, so get them while they're still legal.

887,http://www.armslist.com/posts/913887,For Sale:  Smith & Wesson M&P Shield 9mm 7 Mags 945 Rounds Ammo,"Appleton, Green Bay, Wisconsin","$ 1,000","Listed On: Wednesday, January 23, 2013",Handguns,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"For sale my gently used Smith & Wesson M&P Shield 9mm handgun. This gun is in like new condition, I am the original owner and have put only 56 rounds through it. I am a revolver guy but purchased this to used as a CCW on the rave reviews.  As you may or may not know, this gun is impossible to find and Smith & Wesson has a waiting list of over a year for it. Based on this information I ordered one several months ago having not gotten a chance to fire it. The gun comes with both 7 and 8 round mags. I purchased 3 additional 8 round mags and 2 additional 7 round mags as well. 

Having put a few rounds through this I just can’t bring myself to “LIKE” a striker fire gun, not fond of Glocks either. Rather than throw it in the safe and let it sit, I would like to move it on to a good home where it will be used. These are hard enough to find, no need for me to hoard something I won’t even use!

Gun is in like new condition, not a scratch or mark on it. Comes with all original accessories.
4 total 8 Round Mags
3 total 7 Round Mags
5 of the Mags were purchased direct from Smith & Wesson for $37.95 each and all are genuine. Majority of the mags are unused.

I really went all out, Purchased 1000 rounds of Remmington 9mm Ammo. Would also like to sell the remaining 945 rounds as this is the only 9mm firearm that I own. 

So here is the deal, I do not need to sell. As stated, I would like to move this all onto a better home however I do not intend on losing anything in this deal. If I can’t get new gun, or very close to new gun pricing I would rather keep it. 

I would rather sell this to someone FTF and let the ammo go with. I realize that its nearly impossible to ship ammo so if no interest locally I will consider shipping w/o ammo. I am not a dealer so will have my FFL ship to your FFL. Shipping and insurance including my FFL fee will be $50, you will also likely need to pay your local dealer a fee to transfer.

I’m looking for $1000 including the ammo and think this is a fair price. My price is based on the following breakdown.
Shield $500
Mags $200
Ammo $250 

Keep in mind that New I had to pay tax on all of this plus additional background fees, etc. So no, I am not scalping. Add this all up and I truly am looking to break even."

Patented BDC reticle

The BDC reticle allows hunters to hold 'dead-on' at ranges exceeding those previously thought possible. The BDC's unique see-through ballistic circles offer an incredible advantage for long range shooting, yet allow a normal sight picture for shorter-range shots where the crosshair itself is the aiming point.

Fully Multicoated Optical System

Provides up to 98% light transmission and maximum brightness from dawn to dusk.

Generous, Consistent Eye Relief

Keeps your brow safe--even with the heaviest recoiling cartridges, lightweight rifles, and severe shooting angles.

Precise, 1/4-MOA Handturn Adjustments

Positive click reticle adjustments get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting--even with heavy recoil.

Zero-Reset Turrets

To simplify field adjustments, Nikon has integrated this feature into all new riflescopes. Just sight-in as usual, then lift the spring-loaded adjustment knob, rotate to your ""zero"", and reengage. Field adjustments are now as simple as dialing-in your subsequent ranges.
