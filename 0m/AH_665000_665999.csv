#200183 4.5-14x-42mm Ballistic Plex Black Matte Scope  The Burris Fullfield II scope is an enhanced model of the Fullfield version. It boasts a more forgiving sharpness and eye clarity for positioning fore and aft, and left and right. Using modern alloys and machining techniques the weight has been reduced by 20%-25% without affecting durability or optical performance.  Most scopes have three or four potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area. The Fullfield II has but two. These leak paths are sealed with special quad seals rather than low-tech O-rings. To change magnification, turn the entire eyepiece, which is now integral to the power ring. A European-style adjustable eyepiece is easy to use and requires no locking mechanism.  Burris has moved the adjustment system rearward to better accommodates mounting situations. Also, the eyepiece is shorter, allowing even more mounting flexibility.  This is a great big game and varmint dual-purpose scope.

I've owned this rifle for a month or so, and purchased it new.
It is still in EXCELLENT, like new condition.
It has fired around 300 rounds. Sighted and shoots less than nickel sized groups at 50 yards using cheap Winchester white box ammo. This is a GREAT gun, VERY accurate, and VERY reliable. Never had a problem.

Comes with the Accutrigger package, a sling, Weaver mounts,  BSA Sweet 3-9x scope, 10 round clip, and a few hundred rounds of ammo. I'll throw in a case too, for the asking price.

I bought this rifle for small game hunting. I generally use my shotgun for Cottontail rabbits, but I bought this for longer range shots at Antelope Jacks. The ONLY reason I'm selling this marvelous rifle is to upgrade from a .22LR to a .22WMR. 

275$ or trade for a .17HMR or .22WMR.

Excellent rifle, literally the most accurate rifle I've shot, better than the Marlins, Remingtons, and will easily outshoot a modified Ruger 10/22.

 Whether you are buying your first A-15 rifle, or need a simple and effective carbine, the DPMS Lite 16 is for you. This carbine earns its name with its 16"" light profile barrel, A1 style upper receiver, and six position collapsible stock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.5 lbs. The simple A1 upper receiver allows for windage adjustment to the sights, leaving elevation adjustment to the front sight post. The 16"" barrel although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. And the collapsible stock makes this carbine very handy and compact.

Bought and never installed.  I don't have a low profile gas block, and I'd rather have the 2 piece quad rail.  It comes with a full length upper rail and 3 movable rails about 3"" long.  You can go to the DanielDefense website and check it out.  Really nice rail, but I'm looking for something a little simpler.  You have to remove the gas block and barrel nut to install this one.  I paid about 239.00 for it.  

The Daniel Defense Modular Float Rail (MFR) 9.0 is a Mid Length Customizable AR-15 Handguard that is CNC machined from Aircraft-Grade 6061-T6 Aluminum for superior strength and light weight. The MFR features a Continuous Top Rail and provisions to mount additional M1913 Picatinny-Spec Rail Sections anywhere along the Free Floating Tube's body. The handguard's 9"" Length is ideal for use with Mid Length gas systems, while also being fully compatible with a Carbine Length gas system when a low profile gas block is installed. 

The MFR's slim tube profile is comfortable to grasp with the support hand, enhancing a shooter's ease of handling and overall control of the rifle. The handguard sacrifices nothing in terms of versatility, allowing for the addition of accessories where needed while eliminating all extraneous unused rail space for a lightweight, trim package that won't snag on gear or abrade the hands. Includes 9"" MFR Handguard, 3 Detachable Modular Rail Sections, Barrel Nut Wrench, Barrel Nut, 4 Set Screws with Nylon Locking Patch, 2 Allen Wrenches and Installation Instructions.

Custom assembly performed by the craftsmen at Atomic Tactical Inc. in Bloomington MN. Without a doubt the smoothest shooting AR15 I've ever run. As seen above, best of the best components used in the custom build. 

Performance wise it shoots like a .22 and barks like a .308. Put it this way, the thing doesn't move when you shoot it and comp concussion is pretty mild to the shooter. Dropped a large sum on the build and assembly and am letting it go for next to nothing in pursuit of another project.

Barrel has been broken in and has been run for approx. 400 rounds. All other components are in excellent condition.  

Contact me at your convenience and we'll make arrangements. Thanks for looking.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

Features a Nitron®-coated stainless steel slide over a dark hard anodized alloy frame. Hogue® Grips round out this package.

991,http://www.armslist.com/posts/665991,For Sale:  M6 Scout Survival Rifle (.22 lr over .410 shotgun),"Foothills, Tucson, Arizona",$ 625,"Listed On: Monday, December 3, 2012",Rifles,Springfield                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Break Open,no type,"The M6 Scout is a multipurpose, survival firearm, combining an over/under rifle (.22 long rifle) and a shotgun (.410 bore).  The M6 design and model number come from the M6 Aircrew Survival Weapon, issued to U.S. Air Force aircrew from the late 1950s until the early 1970s. Aircrew who were issued the M6 were instructed how to make a field expedient forearm by wrapping the barrels with a length of 550 paracord.  This has been done on this weapon, with the paracord wrapped neatly but carefully so as not to compress the barrels.

Thus is a survival-type gun equipped with a hidden storage compartment along the top of the buttstock to hold extra ammunition (15 rounds of .22 lr, AND 4 rounds of .410), and a grip-type trigger designed for use while wearing a glove, as well as normal finger-operated use.  This gun has a flip-up, interchangeable sight, for use when you are firing either the rifle or shotgun barrel and also has embedded screws for a scope mount. The gun breaks down into two pieces with the removal of one, easy-to-remove, captive pin (a spare pin is also included in this sale).

This model was imported by the Springfield Armory (logo and markings in the right side) and manufactured by Ceská Zbrojovka Uhersky Brod (CZ) (logo and markings in the left side). This model is the .22 LR/.410 shotgun bore combination. The gun is in excellent condition. Both bores are bright and shiny.

This fine firearm breaks down into two sections for easy transport and scratch-free storage in the included, two-compartment, new case which is specially made by Springfield Armory for the M6.  The M6 is designed as a breakdown gun which can easily be carried in a backpack for use as a camp gun on camping or hunting trips.  It also makes a nice truck gun for every-day availability.  

The combination of readily available .22 long rifle and .410 shotgun ammunition for use in one firearm also make it an ideal addition to your emergency planning and survival gear.
