I'm sure everyone is familiar with this model of rifle by now.  This particular one has the shorter of the two available barrel lengths at 16"".  Has an all metal trigger assembly, if that is something you're looking for.  The bolt assembly and internal trigger mechanisms have al beenpolished and trigger pull has been smoothed out and is consistent and crisp.  Still has the original hardwood stock and overall the rifle is in great condition, with just the normal nicks and few dings you would expect from a rifle that has been used and is this age.  Mechanically it is perfectly sound and feeds, fires, and ejects flawlessly with every type of ammo I've fed it.  

It comes with two factory ten round magazines, one Ruger bx25 factory 25 round magazine and about 200 rounds of assorted ammo.  Most of that is Remington bulk with some CCI mini mags and Aguila 60 grain subsonic as well.  

Just selling because I'm wanting to consolidate calibers and this rifle needs to be passed to someone who will use and enjoy it.  

Would sell outright or will also trade for any Norinco (Chinese) SKS and I will add another 175.00 for that if it's in good condition.  Will also trade plus 175.00 +/- for any Mossberg 12 gauge with 18 or 20"" barrel.  

Hoping to sell before the end of the week.  Will meet FTF in the Concord/Charlotte area or as far north as Lexington.  Can email other pics if needed.  Thanks."

I do not know If the gun can be cleaned somehow to make the rest visible or what but I am going to have to sell it as an antique instead of a firearm. The gun will shoot good as new and is a priceless collectors piece to WW1 or 2 collectors. Gun has been passed down to me over the generations and I guess I'll sell it. If its worth hundreds more please do advise. But i will sell it for posted price since it is of no use to me. I will not ship it. I probably won't trade it, not very interested in antiques, but if you are this is a rare piece. Will meet within reasonable distance. Cash only payment accepted unless we decide to trade.

Sigs description of the Scorpion:

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
 The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."

And this is ONLY ONE left on the website. This model is damn hard to find because after the Springfield Micro Compact came out, SA stops making the Ultra Compact. But,in my opinion, i'd take the Ultra Compact over the Micro :all stainless steel(the Micro is Aluminum frame), 3.5 barrel(the Micro is 3''),well balanced( the Micro is to light,and recoil is kick like a bitch, i shot one before at the range and i decided go with the Ultra).
To be honest with you guys,i paid $899 for the gun,$35 for the shipping,and $20 for the transfer fee.Actually,there was a little more for the credit card fee,but i know about the part: i paid by card and i have the cash for local sale,that's why i agree to lose some money.Fair enough??The gun is NIB,never been fired(see the tag still attached on the trigger guard?).

I am really busy,don't contact me and say you're gonna buy it and then you don't. i'm tired of been gone out to meet people and then came back home with empty hands. You can waste your time, don't waste mine. Just want to make it clear. I'm a gun enthusiast and i do have a nice guns collection,i'm not really in debt and the only reason forced me to let it goes just because i don't intend to carry another piece and i just need the money back exactly which i paid for it. After 03/15 and if it hasn't  been sold,i'll keep it for good. Now,the time is starting to count.........

Originally purchased for $2,100.

The original SL8-6 receiver was tragically damaged and has been replaced with a BRAND NEW SL8-1 receiver (originally grey) by H&K, as no SL8-6 replacement receivers currently exist in the U.S. It has been professionally ""Duracoated"" black for a tough, scratch resistant surface to perfectly match with the rest of the weapon. This is one VERY tough, PERFECTLY applied coating. It has been test fired with 30 rounds and runs like a top! 

It comes with a VERY well made after-market low profile optics rail (purchased from HKParts.net) included. No box or case.

Also comes with four H&K 10 rd. magazines, two 20 rd. ""Promag"" magazines, the manual and HK tool.

The current price is as LOW AS I CAN GO at this time as I'm already taking a heavy loss from having it restored to excellent working condition. I'm even throwing in the magazines for free. It's a SWEET rifle! Any offer too much lower and I might as well put a really nice scope on it and keep it. In fact, in two months this offer will expire and I WILL keep it, so don't lose your chance at this great deal!

The Soviet 5.45×39mm cartridge is a rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge. It was introduced into service in 1974 for use with the new AK-74 assault rifle. It gradually supplemented then largely replaced the 7.62x39mm round in service.

Info below from Wikipedia

The 5.45×39mm is an example of an international tendency towards relatively small sized light weight military service cartridges. Cartridges like the Russian 5.45×39mm, 5.56×45mm NATO and Chinese 5.8×42mm allow a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight compared to their larger and heavier predecessor cartridges and produce relatively low bolt thrust and free recoil, favouring light weight arms design and automatic fire accuracy."

It has a stainless steel guide rod installed. The serial number indicates that it was built in mid to early 2011 and I have put about 200 rounds through it with no issues at all. The trigger on this pistol is extremely smooth and breaks clean, it features the shorter pull target trigger which lets off about 1/8"" sooner than the standard Kahr trigger. It really is the Cadillac of the Kahr lineup. The small grip on the Kahr series doesnt agree with my hand and shooting stance, this one is really effective as a one handed gun if you have medium/large hands and fits the ladies perfectly.

The car just rolled 66K miles and nearly EVERYTHING on the car works!  The car has Glossy Paint and the Cushioned Velour Seats!  The car drives like a dream just like the day it rolled off of the factory floor!   This car has the Buick 3.8 L motor, which is definitely the best V6, if not motor, that GM ever made. 

This car was meant to be a technological masterpiece.  Here is a list of the options included on this car.  Keep in mind that ALL of these work:
Digital Dash
Driver Information System
Cruise Control
Keyless Entry
Climate Control System 
Self Leveling Suspension
Power Driver AND Power Passenger Seats
A/C Upgraded to R134A in 2009
Tilt Steering
Alloy Wheels
Rear Window Defrost
Auto On/Off Headlights
Sentinal Lighting (leaves lights on for desired amount of time after ignition is turned off)

The only things that the car has issue wise are the following:
Headliner is starting to sag (A $150 fix at an upolstery place)
Power Antenna does not work (it is stuck in the ""UP"" position and gets reception fine; it just does not go ""UP"" and ""DOWN"" when the ignition is turned ""ON"" and ""OFF"" respectively).
Factory Stereo has issues.  Only one channel works.  This was remedied when I installed a new Pioneer Super Tuner.  It is very tastefully done.  The kit has wood trim on it that matches the factory dash very well.

I am looking for $3200 cash.  I think this is fair because this car, in this condition would easily sell for $2500 w/ 120K miles on it.  I will consider vehicle, motorcycle, and firearms trades as well (may be looking for more trade-wise, but it is negotiable).

I am selling this because I just bought a 2012 Chrysler 200 S and don't really need this.  I would only consider vehicle trades that offer something this doesn't.  That's why I prefer either a Sports Car or Import w/ great fuel economy as a possible tarde.  Firearms trades or Motorcycle trades are always considered!

I'm looking for something around the range of a Mossberg Silver Reserve or Onyx Reserve. I'm not interested in stogers unless it is their high end competition model, or synthetic shotguns such as a maverick unless they are priced at exceptionally good deals.

Gold inlay, dual triggers, and or gold triggers are a definite plus to me and I may be willing to pay more for the right shotgun. Please offer anything that you have for sale :D

Both are in EXCELLENT condition. 

The Italian Beretta has slight holster/slide wear towards the muzzle on one side, but is nothing major. It has also had some trigger work done by a local gunsmith is very good and very well known. Has the best trigger on a Beretta 92 that I've ever felt, but isn't anything that would seem dangerous or feel weird. Just lighter and very smooth. The slide action is like glass or like its on ball bearings. You have to try it to believe it. 

The CX4 Storm Carbine takes the Beretta 92 series mags, and functions flawlessly. It is a completely ambidextrous weapon, all controls can be changed over to either side you choose (lefties will like that). This carbine is very accurate at 50 yards, does fine at 100 yards as well. Recoil is literally nonexistent, you will forget you're shooting the gun except for the sound of it going off. This model has all the rails - one on each side of the forend, one underneath with a vertical foregrip attached, and the one that slides in or out of the frame, below the barrel. It even has the picatinny rail on top, for optics mounting. Included is a higher rise picatinny rail as seen in the picture, with a Target Sports 2X scope that has the red illumination reticle capability (battery powered). All of that alone cost me around $900+ when purchased. 


Between the two weapons I have six 15 round mags, one 10 round mag, one 20 round mag, one brand new unused 30 round mag. All of these are Beretta mags or MecGar, not junk mags. I also have three new 15 round Pro Mags that were given to me, but I don't generally like Pro Mag. You can have them if you wish. 

If purchasing, price can be negotiated within reason."

591,http://www.armslist.com/posts/314591,For Sale/Trade:  Beretta CX4 Storm Carbine 9mm and Beretta 92F,"savannah, Savannah, Georgia","$ 1,175","Listed On: Thursday, February 23, 2012",Rifles,Beretta USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I have an Italian Beretta 92F and a Beretta CX4 Storm Carbine, both chambered in 9mm. Both are in EXCELLENT condition. 

The Italian Beretta has slight holster/slide wear towards the muzzle on one side, but is nothing major. It has also had some trigger work done by a local gunsmith is very good and very well known. Has the best trigger on a Beretta 92 that I've ever felt, but isn't anything that would seem dangerous or feel weird. Just lighter and very smooth. The slide action is like glass or like its on ball bearings. You have to try it to believe it. 

The CX4 Storm Carbine takes the Beretta 92 series mags, and functions flawlessly. It is a completely ambidextrous weapon, all controls can be changed over to either side you choose (lefties will like that). This carbine is very accurate at 50 yards, does fine at 100 yards as well. Recoil is literally nonexistent, you will forget you're shooting the gun except for the sound of it going off. This model has all the rails - one on each side of the forend, one underneath with a vertical foregrip attached, and the one that slides in or out of the frame, below the barrel. It even has the picatinny rail on top, for optics mounting. Included is a higher rise picatinny rail as seen in the picture, with a Target Sports 2X scope that has the red illumination reticle capability (battery powered). All of that alone cost me around $900+ when purchased. 


Between the two weapons I have six 15 round mags, one 10 round mag, one 20 round mag, one brand new unused 30 round mag. All of these are Beretta mags or MecGar, not junk mags. I also have three new 15 round Pro Mags that were given to me, but I don't generally like Pro Mag. You can have them if you wish. 

If purchasing, price can be negotiated within reason."

I live outside of HILLSBORO OHIO. If you're reading this ad then you have a computer and can google it to find out where that is. If you buy the gun I'll meet you in town. Yes, when you want to buy something you have to go and get it; that's how it works. DON'T WASTE MY TIME hashing out details over a deal then tell me you want me to bring the gun to you.

For what ever reason, the hand fit is smaller than I like and it’s been a safe-queen ever since. 
She offers a very health 13+1 rounds of .45 ACP knockdown power. One of the things that I really liked is the extra sight radius from the tactical-length 4.25-inch barrel. Most concealed carry weapons have a much shorter barrel with limited sight advantages. The whole design of this pistol is a true defensive handgun. In addition to the tactical-length barrel, she comes with a flush hammer, bobbed beavertail and rounded back sights. All of these features make for a more concealable, snag-free and easy-drawing package. Would have been the perfect conceal carry weapon for me; except I don’t care for the way it fits in my hand. 
Included with the .45 are (2) OEM Para Ordnance 13 round magazines and a nice Fobus-Paddle holster. Regarding the magazines; knowing my brothers bad habit of fully loading both magazines for extended periods of time, the first thing I did was change out the magazine springs with Wolf heavy duty’s. I’ll include these as well as the originals. I’m asking a very firm $650.00 for her and not in any dire need to sell. If she sells it would be nice, if not she can go sit in my safe for a few more years. 
Please feel free to ask any questions and as shown in my pictures, she is in very nice/clean shape."

The SW99 features an internal striker, as opposed to the classical external hammer. The pistol lacks a manual safety; instead a de-cocking button is placed on the top rear section of the slide, which when actuated, places the firearm into double-action mode. This pistol comes with three varying rear grip inserts designed to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearm.

     (A bandolier or a bandoleer is a pocketed belt for holding ammunition. It was usually slung over the chest. In its original form, it was common issue to soldiers from the 16th to 18th centuries. This was very useful for quickly reloading a musket.
A somewhat different form of the bandolier came into use in the 20th century when it accompanied modern cartridges and hand grenades. Bandoliers are now rare due to the prohibitive size of modern magazines. They are, however, still commonly used with shotguns, as individual 12 gauge shells can easily be stored in traditionally-designed bandoliers. In fact, some aftermarket shotgun slings are designed in a similar fashion to bandoliers, albeit with a far more limited capacity than true bandoliers.
The bandolier was used to keep ammunition off a soldier's hips, as carrying too much weight on the hips can constrain movement and cause difficulty in retrieving the ammunition.)

If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself.

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself.

Trade value is $750 unless you have something I really want, $650 is the cash price to move this out the door quick because there is a Sig 226R that I really want and need the cash fast.  Only trade I am really looking for is a railed Sig 226R with NS and SRT trigger and mags, Glock 17 Gen4, M&P's, Springfield Loaded's or other railed 1911's.

I have a Bushmaster medium contour barrel on a DPMS lower with collapsable butstock.  Maybe a thousand rounds through it.  A couple marks here or there from normal use and being in the safe, only thing wrong with the rifle is the ear on the right side of the trigger guard broke when previous owner changed it to a magpul trigger guard.  It is welded back on STRONG and is hardly noticeable.  Of course that is only cosmetic and doesn't affect function at all, this is the main reason for blowing it out at $650.  Comes with everything shown, thanks for looking!

However, let me start off by saying that I am not hurting for money or have to get rid of this, so low ballers need not apply, I know what its worth. This rifle is basicly brand new, has had 200 total rounds through it. The color is patriot brown. I have added the LWRC REPR rail system to the forend,which was an additional $150. Also included is a Troy Battle Sling, Troy rail covers, and a Magpul angled fore arm grip. Rifle also comes with the original box and paper work. I also have the LWRC guitar case that was purchased seperately from the rifle. You can no longer get these and the last one I saw for sale on Ebay sold for $150. The Aimpoint in the picture is a Comp M3 on a La Rue mount that allows it to co witness the iron sites, I also have a low profile ARMS mount for it that will also be included.

Now lets talk price and trade options. If you want the entire package Im putting a cash price of $2300. If you dont want the entire package its $2100 for the rifle and $550 for the sight and both mounts. The rifle must go before the sight. Trades I would consider are Smith and Wesson 500 (short barrell) Ruger Alaskan, Desert Eagle in brushed chrome, and perhaps something in 10mm. I can do multiple trade, trades plus cash, or just plain old cash. The pictures are the best I can do for now, the rifle looks much better in person. I cant drive to far due to my work schedule not allowing it, if your intrested let me know and we will try to work something out."
