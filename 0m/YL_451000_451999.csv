       I recently inherited a Glock 26 gen 4 pistols from a family member. It is brand new and never been fired. I already have a Glock 26 so have no need for both plus I don't really care for the gen 4 version. It has three 10rd flush fit mags, box, paperwork, mag loader, brush, spent casing and 2 extra grip panels. 

       I checked all over for prices and the best I can find is buds gun shop online for $549.99 and that only comes with 2 mags and you still have to pay the ffl to receive the weapon. I'm asking $550 OBO with 3 mags ond not taxes or receiving fees. It just sits in a box so I have no need for it.  

Please E-mail me if interested and have a nice day."

Walther PPS is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses modified Browning type locking with tilting barrel. Frame of the gun is made from impact resistant polymer. Trigger is of double action only type, striker fired, with pre-cocked striker system, similar to QA system used in Walther P99 pistols. This system requires a manual recocking (by partial slide retraction) in the case of misfire. Gun is fitted with automated trigger safety and firing pin block; additional ""storage type"" safety is provided by removable backstrap of the grip; once backstrap is removed, the firing pin is automatically decocked and gun is blocked until the backstrap is reinstalled. This patented system is called QuickSafe by Walther. Sights are low profile, with rear sight adjustable for windage."

The Ruger SR40c pistol has a 3.5"" barrel and an overall length of 6.85"". The pistol weighs 23.40 oz. and features a height of 4.61"", with the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR40. It has a fully adjustable 3-dot sight system and an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers. The SR40c offers modern safety features such as a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator, striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect and an ambidextrous, frame-mounted manual safety.

The SR40c ships with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 9 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate included. The second magazine features a grip extension and holds 15 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized grip. An anti-friction coating is applied to the magazine body to reduce the force required to load the magazines to full capacity.

Quick and easy-to-use break-open action
Double Safety System
Projectile Alignment System for consistent accuracy
1-in-28"" twist rifling
3-9x32 scope with mounts
Pursuit break-open muzzleloaders are earning respect from hunters across the country for their consistent shooting performance and easy-to-use design. The break-open action allows you to prime the muzzleloader quickly. It also reduces cleaning time and ensures a tight seal for positive 209 shotgun primer ignition, even in foul weather. To clean, just open the action, remove the breech plug and clean straight through. Incorporating a Double Safety System, Pursuit muzzleloaders are among the safest available. A cross-block trigger safety is built into the trigger guard just like a standard rifle or shotgun safety. The second safety is built into the hammer that blocks the firing pin from igniting the primer if the trigger has not been pulled. Projectile Alignment System is one of the secrets behind these muzzleloaders’ consistent accuracy. The end of the barrel is bored only 3/8"" to allow the projectile to be aligned perfectly with the rifling each time the muzzleloader is loaded. This also ensures the barrels shoot consistently with a variety of powder charges and different projectiles. The exposed hammer has a hammer spur to accomodate both right-and left-hand shooters. This allows you to cock the gun with a scope mounted. All barrels have 1-in-28"" twist rifling. Fiber-optic sights. Drilled and tapped for a scope. Sling swivel studs. Aluminum ramrod included. .50 caliber only.

The Pursuit LT Ambush comes with a 3-9 x 32mm Matte Black scope. Stock is Next G-1 Vista camo. 26"" nickel barrel."

It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.


The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is a black nitrite finish. 


Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

This is a MAK-90 style AK   In 7.62X39mm
Also known as a type 56 assault rifle made and imported by Norinco.
This is in beautiful condition, only a few very fine scratches in the stock.
No rust spots anywhere, has been in the safe all this time.
All matching serial numbers.
These were imported into America between 1990-1994.
The stock was made as a thumb hole style to ""sporterize"" it.  The grip feels great/ very comfortable in the hand.
I believe the barrel is 16 1/4 inches long.
The rifling is very sharp and clean, from a low round count.
Inherited this from my Uncle a few months ago. Took it apart to check it out before shooting, and it still had much of the grease that it was imported with in the trigger group. I put about 60 rounds through it to dial in the sights, and with the amount left from the only bulk box of ammo that he bought for it, I would say that it has had less than 200 round through it. Not even broken in.  No jams or any other problems.

This comes with everything pictured. 
Plus  a 5 round magazine( not shown.)
and      160 rounds of ammo(not shown)
The extra stock is from another Mak-90, it has some dents and dings in it, but I would cut the grip into a regular handle, slant it back to the butt, to make a cool custom stock, but that's up to you.

The muzzle brake was also from another MAK-90, does not fit, but with a little filing with make a good tight fit.

I would love to keep this and make it a good ""cool"" project, but I already have one AK and don't need another right now.

Warning: I will absolutely require a bill of sale saying that you are not a felon and are allowed to buy and own firearms. I will need your name and drivers licence number. Better if you have a CCW, but not needed.
If this turns you away from the deal, GOOD. 
 I will answer emails back as fast as I can. Want to have a good fair/ trust able sale, not in a super hurry to get rid of it.   If this is what you are wanting, email me. Lowball offers will be laughed at, and not responded to.   This will go to the best trust able offer.

The 357 Maximum is .400"" longer than the 357 Magnum, delivering up to 400 more ft/lbs of energy.
The Maximum is just a longer version of the Magnum and it will shoot those and 38 Special rounds.
This caliber Ruger was produced for only a couple of years before it was shuffled into obscurity because loads using 125 grain bullets that would do flame cutting into the top strap through the b/c gap.
Rounds should have 158 grain or larger bullets to avoid a deep flame cut.
Years later it was eventually found that even with 125 grain bullets the cut created would not grow any more, and that did not weaken the structure of the gun.

This gun is obviously a long enough barrel for hunting with plenty of power.
If you are looking for one to do silhouette shooting - look no further; that's what this was designed for.
The trigger pull has been significantly lightened to fit with the length/weight combination and provide much tighter groups.
With over a foot of distance between the sights, I have no trouble grouping at 100 yards.
One final note on this baby is that it is the only one John Linebaugh can convert to the 460 or 500 Linebaugh Long.

The second picture shows my ability with it from 100 yards standing...

I will require proof of residency for a FTF sale by Drivers License or State Identification card and will provide a bill of sale (copies for each).
I am also willing to ship to your FFL at your cost.

**  Final note:  The ammo is hand-loaded and is included to provide .357 Maximum brass.  Use at your own risk."

All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

 The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

This one is in excellent condition and runs like a champ!
There is some light wear on the bottom forward section of the slide like it was shot off a bag.
(A bag is not needed; I shoot/practice with my AM IV's standing, both single and double handed at 50 yards.)
This one has a 6"" barrel to be legal for handgun hunting (in most places) and plenty of power to take down deer or piggies.
The 45 Win Mag (in my opinion) is around the largest and most manageable of the big bore semi-auto's. 
Because it is a 100% stainless steel semi-auto (about 3.25 lbs unloaded), felt recoil is less than that of most 44 Magnum revolvers.
Ammo is commercially available; I've seen it on shelves and many places online.

If you reload here is some information...
Rounds use the same bullet as 45 Colt, CH/4D had dies on the shelf and new Starline brass is readily available.
(You really you only need a resizing die for 45 Win Mag; 45/454/460 dies work for all others.)

I will require proof of residency for a FTF sale by Drivers License or State Identification card and will provide a bill of sale (copies for each).

This is not the SOCOM barrel, it's the standard barrel that is exactly the type they issue or troops. 

NFA regulations require an extended flash hider be installed (pinned and welded) to bring overall barrel length to over 16"".  So please be aware of this.  The second option is to use as a pistol upper, just don't put any kind of foregrip on it.  Third option is to register a Short Barreled rifle with the ATF.

Rifle has never had a single malfunction in the 200+ rounds I have cycled through it. Front sight is straight as Chuck Norris and the receiver has a few small handling marks but hey, its an AK. You cannot sneeze next to one without scratching it. Mag wabble is minimal/non existent. I hand picked this rifle from a very large selection.

Reason I am selling is to fund another AR-15. Love the rifle and it is a blast to shoot.

I like this gun alot....it have always been well maintained.  It was my first AR and I have treated it really well. It has had about 250 rounds through it and cleaned very well every time it was shot.  This gun has everything someone would want in an AR and has the options available for massive upgrades.  If you were to buy a bone dry gun and throw all these upgrades on it then it would cost you a lot more than this one with all these upgrades. 

Please don't try and low-ball me as I'm not in a money crunch and don't have to sell it now or anything.  Serious people only.  If you wanna shoot it before hand, that is fine.  Buyer WILL HAVE a valid Illinois FOID card that I will check before sale.  Inquery will get pictures and we can meet up so you can see it.

The second gun is a 1976 Bicentennial Ruger Mini 14. In the. 223 cal. This gun is also in very nice condition except for three spots that a previous owner had placed  scotch tape for some unknown reason. The tape is removed and so is the clear coat on those three spots. 

I am interested in hearing about anything you have to trade but mostly interested in older Ruger Single sixes, ""three screws"", Non YUGO sks,

 kel tech plr 16 with aftermarket hand guard. hand guard features pickitany rails on the bottom. aftermarket muzzle break, aftermarket sling adapter. and two 30 round mags. weapon has fired under 300 rounds.  i also have a brand new red do sight i just bought for it($100). i still have the box for the red dot. i will sell the weapon with a soft case that fits it perfectly. its a great fun weapon.i can negotiate on price if some of the aftermarket stuff is removed like the red dot. make me an offer doesn't hurt to ask. i can send more pictures if you want."

I have a complete M38A1 Willys Army jeep from 1954, it is complete! With the original data plates and all the parts are there including top bows and seats, Has new military canvas driver seat as well as the rear bottom seat cushion. I can finish the cnavas job on the other seats if you so desire it. I have spent the better part of 16 months bringing this old Army veteran jeep back to its military glory. It has all the hard to find accessories and attachments. All Five tires are original military tires, as are the rims. I just installed a rebuilt T-90 transmission this year, a complete new old stock exhaust system. This jeep needs some paint and your markings and you are ready for parades, vfw functions or just to jeep around with. I have a box of extra parts that will come with it. Currently the jeep is in 12 volt, I have all the parts to convert over to a complete dual battery 24 volt system. This is the most complete M38A1 offered. Has all the original lifting shackles and front bumper that has not been molested or cut. New ties rods installed, new steering bellcrank, two new front brake cylinders. The fuel tank is original and has already been gone through and restored so you will not have to worry about a fuel tank leaking. Comes with two fuel cans (5 gallon military one is dated 1977 the other is new old stock from 1955) Also comes with two gallons of the correct semi-gloss paint you will need to finish the restoration. If you have any questions call me at 580 six four seven 00 four five. She stops drives and runs. I have put alot of work into this old work horse. But the wife says I can only have one jeep. So now is your chance! 
I also have two original manuals for this jeep that come with it as well. 
If you are a korean war veteran or veteran period, with proof, I will take $500 off the asking price. And last but not least, I will deliver this jeep to within 100 miles of zip 73508, Lawton OK Call, email or text. Thanks for your time."
