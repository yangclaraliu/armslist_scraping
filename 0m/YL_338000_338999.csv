Built for comfort as well as functionality. This Tactical holster features the Self Locking System rotating hood system which is so well suited for the tactical situations encountered today. The hood on the Model 6004 holster can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied.

ISSC-Austria, exclusive importer and distributor of the M22 range pistol, proudly announces the introduction of the ISSC Modern Sporting Rifle; the MK22 in .22 LR.

This exciting addition to the ISSC-Austria 22 caliber lineup is engineered and precision built in Austria, incorporating the look and feel of a military-style designed rifle with the modern elements of a modern sporting rifle platform.

This durable, all-metal rifle gives the shooter a “centerfire” feel even though it is chambered in the economical .22LR cartridge.

MK22 features include: a variable and folding open sight, a Picatinny-style quad-rail for mounting of sights, lights or gripping accessories and a folding and collapsible stock with an adjustable cheekpiece. 

Weighing just a little over seven pounds, the MK22 has an overall length of 35.16 inches when stock is fully extended to 33.7 inches when collapsed. The overall height of the MK22 with sight is 11.7 inches. The overall width is 2.8 inches. Round capacity 22-shot.

Comes with:
Scar, 1 mag, paperwork and box.

For the right deal I'll add a NEW pistol grip with light mount, red/green dot scope and case!  I'll even add a (used) laser/light I have to the deal as well."

As the title says I have a DPMS Panther Oracle AR15, it has a 16inch barrel. The only thing stock on the AR is the upper, lower, and flip up iron sights. Everything else has all been replaced with MagPul Dynamics Parts. I do also have all the stock parts that were replaced. Below is a list of all the MagPul parts on the AR.

Also the Handguard is a UTG Handguard with UTG and MagPul XTM Rail Covers mixed together. Besides the main MagPul parts, I have the original stock AR Handguard, also have a black Foregrip it came with that I don't know the brand too. I also have the usual AR 15 Carry Handle/Sight but I have Flip-Up back Iron Sights on it instead. Besides the MagPul parts on the AR now that are listed below, and the stock parts and other miscellaneous parts. It also comes with 2 scopes, 1 a Centerpoint the other I don't know the brand to, and also it comes with a Tasco Red Dot Sight. 

As I said below is a list of all the MagPul parts on the AR right now, and all of those parts are BRAND NEW, and have never been used and a round has never been fired with those parts installed.


MagPul Parts on the AR:
1. MagPul MOE Collapsible Stock in Flat Dark Earth
2. MagPul MOE+ Grip with Compartment in Flat Dark Earth
3. MagPul BAD Lever in Black ( all it comes in is black )
4. MagPul RVG Vertical Foregrip in Flat Dark Earth
5. MagPul AFG ( Angled Foregrip ) in Black
6. MagPul PMags, 1-20 round mag in Flat Dark Earth, 1-30 round mag in black.
7. The UTG Handguard has MagPul XTM Rail Covers in Flat Dark Earth


I DO HAVE PICTURES, I AM GOING TO TRY TO UPLOAD THEM TO THIS PAGE TODAY. BUT FOR NOW CONTACT ME AT THE NUMBER BELOW FOR PICTURES AND FOR ALL SERIOUS OFFERS.


I have brought the AR to the range a few times, and have never had any problems at all with it, it has a very low round count. There is hundreds of dollars in MagPul parts installed on the AR and their is hundreds in extra parts and Optics that come with the gun too.

I will sell or trade the AR with or without the MagPul parts on it. Shoot me some cash or trade offers and we can talk. I DO PREFER 1911 TRADES but cash is always nice.

BTW PLEASE DONT LOWBALL ME, if you do, YOU WILL BE IGNORED.

Sold New in 2011, it is showroom new in every way except the Kawasaki and Versys decals have been removed and the fly screen is inverted (It just looks cooler that way). No dings, no scratches on the bike. Garage kept, never rode in inclement weather.

Givi removable hard bags can hold a full face helmet in each. The green inserts on the bags can be removed and black ones (come with the bike) can be used for a different look.

Ridden all winter, but stabil has been used in the gasoline, and only premium grade 100% gas used. I added a battery tender cable harness, but have not had to use the tender yet since I ride so often.

Fast, fun, and a real attention getter. This is my #2 bike so it does not get ridden as often as my primary ride. I want a vintage bike so this one has to go.

He is interested in selling or trading + cash for something new to play with.

I have a Rock Island Armory 1911 Officer model .45 with 3.5"" barrel that has been customized with Duracoat #71 Diamond Plate Silver on frame, and a Duracoat #5 HK SG Black on slide. It has a Wilson Combat lightweight adjustable trigger, polished stainless Wilson Combat beavertail grip safety, polished stainless Wilson Combat skeletonized hammer, Wolff springs, Tiger Maple grips that shift grain pattern as you turn them side to side. Comes with box, 1 factory 7rd mag and one Chip McCormick stainless 7rd mag, manual, test shells, etc. Great CCW pistol.

It has a very low round count, and the non-existent wear marks prove this.

Might trade + cash for right deal.

Dont lowball and tell me what you think this pistol is worth, expect something for nothing, and then post a cry and whine about it. Rock Island Compacts were selling brand new for 450.00+ at the gun show. It has alot of nice stuff, that cost $$ to have done. If you want a pistol that looks great like this one and understand you would have to pay to make yours look like this one, then this is the right pistol for you and lets make a deal.

Let me know if you are interested. Email only please. Cant burn up phone minutes or text dealing with offers until deal is made."

I had this listed as just an upper previously, but now am selling as a complete ready to shoot pistol.

It includes a JP free float tube, Magpul Angled Fore Grip (AFG), Magpul flip up BUIS, Magpul ASAP single point sling mount and sling, and pistol buffer tube.  It comes with 2 mags.

Lower is PSA, Upper is DPMS.  It is a standard AR-Lower that will function just as any other with any AR upper.  Just turn a screw to remove the 9mm mag block (metal), slap another upper on it, and you are GTG.  It will accept a standard stock and buffer tube as well.  

This is a proven set up that I used to run on a registered full auto lower, but it was NOT abused.  

The ProPoint scope is NOT included (I just didn't want to unmount and lose zero), though I will throw it in for another $50.  

It uses the standard Colt Blowback system and UZI type mags.  The magwell block is secured into the lower from the bottom.

Marlin Model 60SS. This one was a project when I bought it. It was in rough shape. I have since refinished the laminated stock and replaced the trigger guard. I have also added a Simmons 4x32 22 Mag scope and rings. I removed the iron sights as they were in bad shape. I will include them with the sale if you want them. The rifle shoots excellent how it is currently but it does need a front TG screw and rear take down screw at some point. They are in stock now but where out when I ordered the TG. t's 100% functional and fires fine without them currently. The receiver does have some nicks in it and are hard to see in the pictures. The shiny spots on the stock are the glare from the sun.

JAPAN MADE!!!

Model: 32-2636M
Model: ANO6410 ?

Fire Fly is when you can hold a flashlight to the end of the scope and the reticles will glow in the dark making it easier to place the cross hairs on your target.

This is the latest model with the Rainguard HD coatings on the lens to prevent fogging or moisture build-up.

This scope was lightly mounted (rings not clamped down with much pressure) on a .223 single action target pistol and has only been shot 10 TIMES!  The finish is perfect with no scratches whatsoever.  It's as close to new as you can get.

The pictures clearly show the mint condition of the scope.  Most of the time it sat in my gun safe.  The going price for these scopes on-line is around $269-$279.  The optics on this scope compare favorably to Leupolds in the same or slightly higher price range.  Don't miss out on this great deal!!

EXCEPTIONAL  Russian SKS Tula Arsenal 1953, all matching numbers, hardwood stock, excellent brite bore, chromium lined barrel, shoots, feeds & ejects perfectly, early KBI import. Complete with KBI manual/brochure, cleaning rod and etc. Great Shooter, always cleaned and non-corrosive ammo used. presently have a butt pad installed, however, original screw and butt plate is there (butt pad was installed over the top, takes 2 seconds to remove if you want original). This is a ex-DDR, meaning East Germany got it from Communist Russia in the 50s ( Has the stock and hand guard marks and the /1\). pre-94 import. half a dozen of stripper clips will be included, also there is a cleaning kit in a butt stock.
last few (just the SKS) on gunbroker in this condition and vintage fetch close to 500-$600 plus shipping plus ffl fee. 

with this sale you will be getting exactly 950 rounds of WOLF 154gr SP ammo (kind you can't get anymore) which I removed from the boxes a while back and separated into ziplocks and into a box.

As far as  ammo, if you can find it (black box Wolf, Non-corrosive, non-re-loadable), it goes now for about 40c a round (as it is the best hunting weight), before it disappeared it was $469MSRP for 1000rounds; so I think this is a fair price for a quick sale(give or take $420 rifle and $380 ammo, or whatever way you want to swing it :) )
and yes, that pouch with cleaning bottle and a sling are all part of the deal :).
 so, a package deal for the rifle, accessories and ammo.

$750.00 (firm) - meet Face to Face, will ask you to sign a bill of sale and verify your age/residency (WI). willing to drive up to 20miles from Neenah, WI 54956 (So South to  South Oshkosh or North to Kaukauna as far as HWY41 goes).

I run Mobile one full synthetic through it with a high performance oil fitter. I put new brakes and tires on it a year ago when I bought it for 6,000. Only selling because the wife talked me into getting her an SUV and I took her newer truck with fewer miles. Full black leather interior, minor things wrong with it as one might expect on a 10 year old truck with 150,000 miles, but nothing major. Engine has excellent compression and runs like a raped ape! The transmission shifts smoothly however, it does have a rear seal leak that requires the tranny fluid be topped off every three months or so and that is driving it every day so it is very minor.( like I said normal issues for a 10 year old truck) NO other oil leaks."

Yugoslavian SKS with extras, in Mentor, OH. $240 gets everything in the ""exploded view"" photo:

Main assembly with Bayonet, grenade launcher, replacement gas shutoff valve (Google ""glane5910 sks valve"" to find info), trigger group, and a Molot optics side rail for using Russian-style optics.
Wood stock
ATI Fiberforce stock
Wood handguard
Vented steel handguard
Original 10-round fixed magazine
1 20-round Tapco magazine
OD green sling

The photos show the different ways it can be configured. The 4X24 POSP scope isn't included for the $240, but I would sell it for $100 extra (I see a bunch for about $200 new).

The wood stock isn't a number match to the rest of the rifle. The Fiberforce stock has been modified to allow the receiver cover to slide off for cleaning (otherwise the receiver has to be dropped out).

It's definitely more of a ""shooter rifle"" than a collector's piece, and that's why I'm asking $240 instead of $300 or more, as I've seen in other ads. As such, I'm pretty firm on the price.
