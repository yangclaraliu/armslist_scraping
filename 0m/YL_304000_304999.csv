EGYPTIAN RASHEED 7.62X39MM SEMI AUTO RIFLE. This unique design is a cross between the Hakim rifle (evolved from the Swedish Ljungman) and the Russian SKS. It uses the basic operating system and stock design of the Hakim, but incorporates the exposed barrel, front sight and folding knife bayonet popular with the Soviet Union, as well as use of their 7.62x39mm cartridge. These are believed to have been made circa 1959-60 to provide large numbers of arms using the same ammo as the Russian supplied AK-47s being adopted at that time. This very rare carbine is in great condition.  Wood stock is very nice, with assorted minor handling dings of an issued military arm, but none really significant. Has original 10 round magazine. These were made at ""Factory 54"" which later became Maadi Military and Civil Industries Corp.  Overall, a very good example of a very scarce rifle, with something like only 6,000-8,000 total production and only about 2,000 brought into the USA. This carbine is a key piece for the “assault rifle” collector or someone interested in Egyptian arms or arms of the Middle East. Priced Reduced:  $700.00"

These are awesome sights that are less than a year old and glow great day or night......I just miss the standard Glock sight picture I have always been used to. 

If u want sights like these that are professionally sighted in and on-target, you can get them for free! I don't want to try and swap the sights myself, and I don't want to pay a gunsmith to install factory sights!

Glock trades must be gen3, and model 19, 23, or 32 only, and must be in very good or like new condition, and must have standard sights!

If your trade is 9mm (G19), we can discuss mags. I have two 13 rnd, one     15rnd, two 17 rnd (+2 extensions), and one 31 rnd magazines for .40/.357  sig to go with gun if not trading for a G23 or G32.

I don't know if anyone out there is interested in a free night sight upgrade, but I want to see before I spend extra dough changing my sights back.

Finally, if you know someone with a sight installation tool in the area who can properly install sights, I would give them the True Glow sights in return for installing standard sights that I provide.

voted #1 carry pistol by On Target Magazine for 2011

Bitone with polished ramp.  I have multiple holsters for it as well.  I bought it new last year and have put about 350 - 400 rounds through it.  Pretty much perfect condition.  I take good care of my investments.  Cleaned within 1 day after shooting EVERY TIME. Now want to move into some bigger stuff so looking to trade for a Glock sub-compact or AR - 15, plus i would throw in some cash.  If you have one and would like to trade please let me know what you have (Brand, magazines, accessories, length of barrel, etc) and how much cash and the CM9 package you would like.  Lets see if we can make a deal.

Here is the info on what I have for this pistol:

it basically sat in the safe after i bought it and broke it in.

purchased in May of 2011 for $499.99 (before tax) - I have the receipt


Original case  and everything that came with it.

2 magazines (7&8 round) from Kahr @ $40 a piece-total of $80 + shipping
2 grip extension from Kahr @ $15 total + shipping

2 holster - both inside the waist - total of $90 paid for both - one is a single clip cheaper model ($35) and the other is a double clip more expensive one ($65)

so that is a total of $685 that I have put into it since May of 2011 

I might sell it outright for the right price.  Please MAKE AND OFFER and we might be able to make a deal.

I know they sell them new on here for $379 but after taxes that is $408 and then if you wanted to get 2 extra mags @$40 a piece plus shipping it would be about $90.  Then you have to get the grip extender for the 6 round mag at $15 plus shipping.  Then get a holster for $60.. you are looking at $575... then you have to put at least 200 rounds through it to make sure it is broken in at $10 a box of 50 for a total of $40 just on ammo.  so you can spend over $600 like I did, or get this one for around $500.

You must have your Permit to purchase or PTC (and MN Drivers license) in order to make this trade or purchase so please don't email if you don't have it."

Grips appear to be the orginal ""Buntline"" grips that were offered as an option when the pistol was made (according to serial number)  revolver was made in 1948.  Shoots better than I can.  Unfortunately, I need to see a CWP or military ID card before I can sell it (sorry, but we live in society where a lot of people think it's okay to make a living through BS lawsuits)  It's really a fun, accurate gun to shoot.   .22 ammo is cheap enough to shoot about every day and since it shoots subsonic .22 it can be shot without driving you neighbors nuts due to very low noise.

I currently have a Leupold 12x40AO fixed power scope on it. An older model without the taller target knobs. I know new a similar scope is going to be 400$. If you don't want the scope I can keep it, if you do then we can negotiate.

Fun rifle, folds in half. Ive added a Glock grip wrap, and added some paracord to the buttstock to take up the sharpness of the recoil so it became a more new shooter friendly gun. Has a UTG front rail, as I had a light mounted on there at one point, found it is a little more accurate with it on, so it stayed. Tape ont he stock tube is gaffer tape, wont leave residue, but is KEY if you shoot it in the cold. Dont want to stick to the rifle! Great rifle, I would keep but switching to 9mm. Decent out to 100 or so yards, able to just keep banging on steel all day long. 30rd mags are S Korean, function well, but hard to load full. 10rd is factory.

I am selling my Mossberg 500 12 ga. tactical shotgun. I bought this gun new two years ago and used it in a few 3-gun competitions. I put about 300 rounds through it, and no longer need it. This is a perfect shotgun for home defense or for shooting heavy metal in 3-gun. This would also be perfect for a tactical shotgun class. As you can see in the pictures this is in excellent condition. The action is very smooth. It has a 20"" cylinder bore barrel and sling swivel studs are already on it. The magazine tube can hold up to 8 rounds of 2-3/4"" shells, depending on the ammo (only holds 7 rounds of european ammo).

The SKS will come with 6-20 Round Tapco Mags. It has a ATI Monte Carlo Stock and will also come with the original wood. I don't have the original 10 round fixed magazine though. The SKS doesn't have standard Iron Sights so I have some pics that will show what they look like. Overall the SKS is in good condition the only bad thing I can say about it is that it does have a pretty noticeable scratch. I have a pic of that scratch and a few other pics of the rifle that I can send if you're interested, just let me know.

I also have an FM Hi-Power w/ 7 Mags. It's in pretty rough shape with wear in different places but shoots great. Except the cheap Remington stuff it eats anything including the Winchester White Box. This one is for trade only but if you'd like to make a cash offer feel free to do so. I'll send pics of what I mean by rough on request. Thanks.
