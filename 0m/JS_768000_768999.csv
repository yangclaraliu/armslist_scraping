But AMMO?  Come on folks, I know it's a bit hard to find .223 right now but the one thing that is not going to be outlawed will be the ammo.  There is too much demand and too many rifles (not just those ""evil"" AR-15's) that take the rounds; not to mention the vast usage by the military and police.  

.223 or 5.56 will be available for purchase for years and years to come and folks asking $1.00 a round now are only trying to play on your fears.  Don't be stupid and pay double retail (or more) when a little bit of a wait will see this mess through.  The ammo companies will have more on the shelves sooner or later."

I looked at every option and other postings to obtain a fair but competitive price. With all that is going on with anticipated high cap bans, and a production freeze on these from Glock which can be verified through Glock. Also, the few I found left on this site are cheap Korean junk and going between 80 and 100 dollars each and a few that were used and beat to death the same price. These are new and are in mint condition and Glock factory. I will sell the 33 rounders for $115.00 and the 17 rounders for $80.00. (YOU CAN ADD ONE DOLLAR PER ROUND FOR HYDRA SHOK HOLLOW POINT 124GR +P+ IF YOU WOULD LIKE THEM WITH AMMO OR .75 CENTS PER ROUND FOR FMJ 115gr).

The EMAG (Export MAGazine) is a lightweight 30-round 5.56x45 NATO polymer magazine that features a number of aesthetic and functional changes from the PMAG®. While EMAG remains 100% compatible with the AR15/M16 platform, its unique geometry is optimized for foreign-made weapons such as the British SA-80 (L85A1/A2, L86A1/A2, L22A1, L98A1/A2), HK 416, M27 IAR, and others.

EMAG features the same pop-off Impact/Dust Cover as the PMAG GEN M2 to prevent dirt and debris intrusion and protect the feedlips from potential impact damage during transit and storage. When not in use, the Impact/Dust Cover can be stored on the magazine's floorplate to prevent possible loss.

For easy and accurate identification of loaded round count via the large, dual-sided MagLevel windows, the stainless steel magazine spring is coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color.

Thanks to its modular layout, this rifle can be adapted to fit each user’s exact needs. Its straight-line design, running from the muzzle to the shooter’s shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip. This allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a fresh round into the chamber as the bolt silently glides through a polymer guide. The Model 98B rifle’s aluminum upper receiver boasts an 18-inch M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions. This impressive long-range weapon isn’t all work. Equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod, it’s also a pleasure to shoot. From its highly efficient muzzle brake to its shooter-adaptable design and unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action. Model 98B Caliber: .338 Lapua MagnumOperation Bolt Action Repeater Weight:13.5 lbs. (6.12 kg) or 12.4 lbs.

Each custom-gunsmithed .45 features extensive coverage of 24-Karat Gold plating for lasting beauty and value. As a proper memorial to your service branch, patriotic symbols, inscriptions, and the founding date are deeply etched and 24-Karat Gold plated across the slide. The grips are of select wood and are custom-fitted to your pistol. Inset as the focal point of both grips are fired-enamel cloisonnés of the official symbol of your service branch.
Limited Edition; Fires .45 ACP.
Every gun is individually number.
There were only 2500 of this commemorative pistol made. This is #1580.
JUST TO BE CLEAR, this is NOT a replica pistol, it is a fully functional standard issue military M1911A1 pistol made by Auto Ordnance. These commemorative .45s were made by Auto Ordnance and Colt, being commissioned by the American Historical Foundation. They sold in 1988 via mail special order for $2095. This is the Army commemorative, but they also made them for all branches of service.
The original owner had it in the case from 1988 till this September and I got it after his passing. His name and Rank is engraved with laser as he ordered it. Making this a real valuable and collectors piece of memorabilia. He earned a Purple Heart and 2 Bronze stars.
You can Look him up online. Birth day, Achievement in the Military

It is in pristine condition.
I would value this around $1500 cash or $2000 trade.

The mags include 2 steel standard issue mags, and 3 new PMAGS with windows. Depending on where you go, or who you talk to, thats alot of added value right there. I have the box, and owners manual to go with it also. 

The next generation in the evolution of the SIG556 platform, the SIG556 Patrol Rifle integrates the accuracy of a 16” barrel with the maneuverability and quick pointing ergonomics of the SIG556 Short in a compact, no-nonsense package.

The SIG556 Patrol Rifle is the perfect solution for everything from three gun matches to patrol car deployment. Available in two versions (Swiss type polymer handguards or alloy Quad Rail tactical forend), the SIG556 Patrol Rifle ships standard with the RDSS (Rotary Diopter Sight System).

1. SIze Large/Extra Large Improved TActical Vest. The Improved Outer Tactical Vest, or IOTV, is an enhanced version of, and a replacement for, the older Outer Tactical Vest variant of the Interceptor body armor, as fielded by the United States Army. The IOTV is compatible with the Deltoid and Axillary Protector System (DAPS) components, ESAPI (Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert), Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBI), as well as the OTV's groin protector. 
The IOTV is designed to take the weight of the vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. The vest is also equipped with a mesh inner cover that is designed to improve airflow inside of the armor. There is also a back pad in the lower back area of the vest, which is designed to defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. However, the back pad does not provide ballistic protection. The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear plates (SAPI NIJ standard III), however, the new E-SAPI plates will increase protection to armor-piercing rounds (NIJ standard IV). The IOTV provides, without the ballistic ceramic plates inserted, protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. 9mm) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified. This is a huge improvement over the PASGT vest, and the Vietnam era fragmentation vest (which was made of nylon). Both only offered protection against fragmentation. $250

2. Enhanced body armor plates (Chest and Back), size large $400. These are ceramic plates fielded by the US military. It was first used in the Interceptor body armor, a ballistic vest. It is now also used in the Improved Outer Tactical Vest as well as the Modular Tactical Vest, in addition to commercially available ""plate carriers"". These are advanced plates abd therefore provide protection from .30-06 M2 Armor-piercing rounds with a steel or tungsten penetrator, but costs about $600 per plate on the market. $400. Works well with teh above vest

3. Field Trauma Kit $40. Includes case, C-A-T splint, compressed gauze. rol of medical tape, Quick Clot, surgical gloves and an airway kit. $40

4. Advanced Field First Aid Kit $60. Includes case, surgical gloves, foour seperate 4""x4"" dressing spounge, bag of band aides. burn gel, dressings, 2 x Quik Clot, med stopper gauze, 4""x5"" bandage, Triabgular bandage, tweezer and Trauma Scissors. $60

5. Medical Instrument and Supply BAG (BAG ONLY....no instruments or supplies) $5

6. Size large current military MICH Helmet $300. The MICH ranges in weight from about 3 lb (1.36 kg) (size medium) to just over 3.6 lb (1.63 kg) (extra large). It uses a new, more advanced type of Kevlar and provides increased protection against handgun rounds. A pad system and four-point retention system, similar to the cushions and straps found on bicycle helmets, replaces the nylon cord suspension system, sweatband and chinstrap found on the PASGT helmet. The change provides greater impact protection and comfort for the wearer. It can be fitted with a mounting bracket for an AN/PVS-14 monocular night vision device (MNVD) on the front, similar to that on the PASGT helmet. It can also be fitted with a pair of straps on the rear to keep protective eyewear in place, as well as cloth helmet covers in varying camouflage patterns including M81 Woodland, three-color desert, USMC MARPAT, U.S. Army UCP, Crye MultiCam, and solid black for use with SWAT teams. As with its PASGT predecessor, the MICH is often worn with a band around it which features a pair of reflective ""cat eyes"" — patches on the back intended to prevent friendly fire incidents. $300

It weighs about 8 to 9 lbs and is a blast to shoot. Plane and simple this gun is awsome and im having a hard time letting this go.

Im getting rid of it so I can replace my old AR 15 223 that I used for coyote hunting and no im not selling my old AR we have hunted way to long together for me to get rid of it. Im not looking to make alot of money just need what I have into it. The wife has got involved or I would keep it in a second.  This gun would make a great home defense rifle or great big game rifle or both.  The Scope on it is not a cheap one and is not included in the price.  Its made by leupold and is like new still.  Its like a Red Dot but better. If you want the scope to stay on the rifle we will work something out thats fair for both sides .   If you want it or have questions email me or call my cell.

These are not reloads. All boxes contain 20rds. These are 30-06 that you can use in a M1 garande aside from a hunting rifle. Its suggested you do not use hunting soft point rounds out of a garande and that why american eagle developed these. I am asking $22 a box but if you buy 10 or more ill drop it to $21 a box. Sorry but theres not much mark up on these. any question feel free to ask.

Unlike metal magazines, Thermold products won't jam because they're made with a nylon that resists heat, dirt and rust. Abuse them, drop them, throw them in the mud. They are dent resistant, self lubricating and non-corrosive.

Every magazine has passed the U.S. military’s drop test and also survived a few other manufacturer tests !  Thermold has driven over them with full-sized trucks and dropped them from 4 feet onto concrete. The magazines never jammed. With regular maintenance, the will last a lifetime. Magazine bodies, followers, butt-plates and feeding springs are manufactured by Thermold in the U.S.A.

Non-corrosive and self-lubricating; will not jam under normal conditions. Just as good as a magpul."

Extremely reliable and durable AR-15 magazine at a great price. 

Collecting input from military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters, TAPCO has designed a magazine that can be depended on from a trip to the firing range to deployment overseas. 

Molded of reinforced composite with aggressive horizontal ridges that provide increased gripping surface for insertion and extraction of the magazine in wet or muddy conditions. This also helps to eliminate feed lip separation. 

The anti tilt follower has been designed to allow more dirt and grime to pass than any other magazine on the market. This allows the magazine to keep feeding ammo, despite loose dirt or sand that may have entered the magazine. 

The spring is made using a 1770 Stainless steel wire, featuring a unique shape for smoother, quieter loading through all 30 rounds. It also reduces overall stress on the magazine body, preventing spine cracks. 

30 Round capacity. Fits AR15, M4, and M16. Black 

Made in the U.S.A. with a lifetime warranty from TAPCO."

I am selling this because i simply spent beyond my means when i was building it ( i'm sure i'm not the first guy to do that).  i can meet at an FFL of your choice within 2 hours or so of Pittsburgh, or help you find one if you aren't sure where your nearest dealer is. i'm not in a huge rush, but i realize the potential legislation changes may have you in a rush to acquire a firearm like this, so i'm ready to go.  If you have an existing scope or sighting system you'll be using and have no use for the Troy sights, i would take $60 off if i could keep them ( they are still in new condition and i could return them), but i don;t want to list a piece on here with no sights at all.

I bought it new from a local dealer. I later replaced the factory sights with Trijicon night sights (green front and rear orange which all appear white in daylight). The sights, which cost $100 at the time, are bright with five years remaining on the Trijicon factory warranty. I have the original receipts for both the gun and the sights, but I did not keep the plastic box. I can't say exactly how many rounds I've fired with this pistol, but I'm sure it was not more than ten boxes (500 rounds). In other words, it's barely getting warmed up. I never experienced a misfire with a variety of ammo. The handgun comes with three 15-round magazines (one magazine from an earlier generation G22). I bought an extra spring-guide rod assembly just in case I might need it, which I will include in the sale. My current price is firm and I am not interested in trades. I'm accepting only face-to-face cash transactions. I do not have an FFL. This would be a private party sale. If you look younger than 21 years old, lucky you, but I will request to see an official ID to prove that you've reached your 21st birthday. I also will ask that you fill out a simple private-party sales receipt for my protection. At the moment, I'm too lazy to take and upload a picture, but if you really want pictures, I'll email some. To me, this pistol looks new. There are no dents or scratches. Incredibly, I've never dropped it. Again, I'm accepting only cash payment. Thanks for your interest."

The rave reviews of this gun sold me so completely that when I finally found one at the store, I made an impulse buy.

I was not the slightest bit disappointed. My 8yr old son and I made a trip to the skeet/trap range and had a great time with this gun that operated flawlessly as expected.

Had read reviews of people shooting 1,000 rounds or better without any hint of trouble in cycling the rounds or otherwise. Just a great, lightweight, all-weather, totally reliable gun.

It is a dual piston gas operated gun which works flawlessly and has incredibly low recoil for such a light weight easy to carry gun.

I splurged and put on an additional limb saver recoil pad and strap for my 8yr old and he shot two boxes of shells with no complaints and loved every second of it. My son BTW is built like a stick. Your Grandma could carry and shoot this thing all day long.

I purchased this gun new 2 months ago at Bass Pro. It comes with the original box, the sling, the recoil pad, a full set of chokes, stock shims to adjust length of pull, a soft case and two boxes of shells.

My cost was over $700 out the door on everything shown. Everything is absolutely brand new without a single scratch. It has only been out of the case one time!

Since then my son and I have gotten more into target shooting with pistols and only selling the SA-08 as wonderful as it is to fund our new interest.

For $450 or best offer you can have the entire package today and drive straight to the range or wherever and have a blast whether your 8 or 80.

These rifles were produced for the Finnish Civil Guard(1924-1928).

This one has the German made Bohler Stahl stepped barrel with an 1898 dated  antique receiver the bore I would rate as good or better. 

It has a matching bolt, original bluing and has been counter-bored for improved accuracy.

The stock has no visible cracks or splits but does have the usual handling marks for an 80 plus year old military rifle.

The sling pictured is not part of the sale, but the sling swivels do stay with the rifle.

Avoid the crowds, long lines, shipping cost and other charges.

Available for immediate sale ""face to face"" only  in the Richmond, Henrico or Mechanicsville areas.

 looking to retire; I only want to buy my new rail thanks. As stated ctr stock is separate from the ammo, mags, and handguard trying to switch to flat dark earth, Troy has their car/m4 
rail in fde and that's what I'am getting. The ammo, mags, and handguard are a package will not split and even if you don't take handguard price remains the same."

It has Wolf hammer and trigger springs, for a much smoother double action pull, and shoots anything I feed it.

I'd keep it, but I have too many full size pistols, and would prefer a smaller pistol to use for concealed carry.

Brand New, Rare 1927 A5 West Hurley NY, Original Auto Ordinance ""Pistol"". Only 3,500 manufactured and discontinued during the FIRST 1994 Ban on Assault guns. These limited pistols were hard to find even after the expiration of the first ban with W. Bush. Includes new 50 round factory drum and new 30 round factory stick mag. This pistol is NOT the same as the common Kahr Arms produced TA51 model that you can find anywhere, it has the highly sought after original style solid steel receiver and not the cheaper aluminum ones produced by Kahr Arms. It also comes (factory furnished) with the trademark ""gangster"" foregrip, which is illegal if not impossible to add to the TA51s without registered paperwork and proper gunsmithing. The majority of these extremely rare pistols, aka. ""trench broom"" have been converted to fully autos by collectors and tommy gun enthusiasts, so it is very difficult to find a semi auto like this one in brand new condition. Most collectors are also adding full stocks to SBR their Thompsons, which can be added on with the proper gov. forms and specialized work by qualified armorers. This one is definitely a real functioning heirloom, mantle piece that is brimming with American history! This might be your last opportunity to own the firearm that made the 20s roar, served in the trenches of WWII, Korea, and Vietnam!

I might consider trades for other rare quality rifles or multiple gun trades, but it has to be equal in trade value of $3,500 or $3,000 CASH.

Both watches are guaranteed for life by Bvlgari and that warranty is transferable to the new owners. Selling for $1500.00 in cash, or trade for $2000.00 in firearms, or best offer either way.

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/768998,For Sale:  Sig Sauer P250 (Gen. 2) .45 ACP FS w/ Barska QD Light & Laser  (~300rds),"Nashville, Nashville, Tennessee",$ 400,"Listed On: Sunday, December 30, 2012",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I'm selling my personal Sig Sauer generation 2 P250 full size (4.7"" barrel) in .45 ACP with a Barska quick detach light and laser combo. It comes with the factory 10rd magazine, original Sig Sauer hard case (the foam has been cut to accommodate the light), and all the original Sig Sauer manuals and pamphlets.

This gun has had approximately 300rds of various ammunition types, including FMJ and JHP.  It has never once malfunctioned in any way.  It was cleaned after every trip to the range and is in like new condition. There is no holster wear or any other blemishes on the gun.

The only reason I'm selling it is because my fiance and I moved in together in December and she cannot handle a .45 ACP round. This was my home defense pistol. It stayed in the case under my bed, aside from a few trips to the range. I have already purchased a 9MM to replace this pistol and I am looking to recoup some of the cost. I am not interested in any trades at this time.

Rest assured, this is the total package in a home defense pistol. There are no awkward safeties to fumble with -- you pick up this pistol, aim, and squeeze. It has an ambidextrous slide release and the magazine release can be flipped to fully accommodate left handed shooters.

nutnfancy has this pistol in his Hall of Fame. Here's a link to his review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnCxJbxlikw

I travel to Memphis at least once a month. If you are between Nashville and Memphis, we can arrange to meet-up with enough notice.

This is a private sale. I have been a TN CCW holder since 2005. Again, no trades, please. I can be reached at REDACTED by call or text. My name is Justin."
