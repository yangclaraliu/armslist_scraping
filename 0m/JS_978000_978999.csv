The upper is made by LMT (Lewis Machine & Tool), a company that has been supplying the US military, law enforcement and government agencies with the highest quality weapons, components and modular weapon systems for more than 30 years. Here are a few words written about it from various online publishers:

Defensive Carry.com:
“You know it's built it to run, to last, and take punishment. Its specs are tight and you don't have to ever second guess your purchase with LMT.”
“LMT is probably the best MIL-SPEC rifle going.”

American Rifleman:
“My overall impression of the LMT MRP system was outstanding… The fit and finish of the rifles were top-rate...”

Small Arms Defense Journal:
“Like the barrels and as per Mil-Spec, all LMT bolts are proof tested and them magnetic particle inspected.” “LMT has been a forerunner in new developments and innovation, which will bring the M16/M4 well into the new decade and beyond.”

The lower is made by Gunsmoke Enterprises, a company that specializes in manufacturing custom AR-15 type carbines and match rifles. The company’s owner is Ed Basile, a Navy veteran. Their receivers are CNC machined from 7075 T6 Aircraft Aluminum forgings and are 100% mil spec. Every receiver is laser engraved with the GSE logo, a modified Navy SEAL trident, surrounded by the words “Duty, Honor, Country”.

SWAT magazine reviewed their rifle, conducting tests at the Criminal Justice Institute at Ocala, FL and stated: “…the flawless function, reliability and accuracy that were apparent after 4 days of rigorous drills fired from multiple positions and distances with the variety of ammunition deserve my highest marks.”

It is a special buy from a military contract overrun from the famed Lake City plant. It is perfect for shooting with your 5.56x45mm chambered AR-15! Tracer ammo is a great training tool for shooting in low light situations. Many serious shooters find that shooting with tracer ammo is a fun experience and a great training tool. You can actually watch the bullet's flight path through the air with your naked eye! M196 55 gr tracer ammo is actually preferred by many civilian shooters over the more commonly found M856 64 gr tracer load. The reason for this preference is that this projectile will stabilize in a broader range of barrels from 1:9 to 1:12 while the M856 projectile is properly stabilized with only a quick twisting 1:7 twist rate which is less common. If you're unsure, just check your AR-15's barrel and the twist rate will be displayed. If you see a 1:9 or 1:12, then you're good to go! Whether you're looking to do some serious low light training and target practice, or just some fun watching the flight of the bullet, Lake City's M196 5.56x45mm ammo is a great option! Each round is brass-cased, boxer-primed, non-corrosive, and reloadable. It is both economical and precision manufactured in the United States by an established U.S. cartridge producer. * Shipping is actual cost via UPS Ground* Payment: I will accept Money order, cashiers check, and discreet PayPal. If paying with PayPal add 3%. If you would like to try some without the BIG investment of buying hundreds of rounds, then be sure to check out other items I have for sale.  They are a FUN to shoot."

I did some research on the serial and discovered the lower was sold from Eagle Arms as a stripped receiver. The upper comes from a company in Toledo area called Sherluk Marketing. I'm unsure of what the internals installed on this lower consist of. As you can see in the pic, it has the forward assist and dust cover. I have installed a T marked quad rail on the front, 5 position vertical foregrip and scope mount rail on the fixed carry handle. Also comes with a sling and 1 30 round Colt magazine.  

The gun has worked great for me and I've cleaned after each use and oiled as needed over the years.  I'd say I've put around 1000 rounds through it and haven't had a single issue in cycling and no misfires.

The only reason I am looking to get rid of this is because I'd prefer to have a 16"" barrel instead of the 20"" on this one. I don't have to sell, so I'm pretty firm on the price. E-mail for more pics, this site can't handle more than the one I put up. Must be cash and/or trade, have ID (preferably CCW) and be willing to meet somewhere in NE OH."

This is the deluxe version model number T150D.  It has never been fired and has been handled very little.  It has also been well maintained and oiled regularly.  This ""tommy gun"" includes one 30 round magazine, one 50 round drum, the original Thompson hardcase with cutouts, and the original violin case. This is your chance to own one of the most iconic firearms in American history. I am willing to trade, but mainly looking for the items listed below.
I will entertain trades for other firearms not on my list.   I'm looking for:
Sig P226 Elite Stainless in .40 S&W  Sig P220 Elite Stainless (either full size or carry)
Sig P229 Elite Stainless (.40 or 9mm)
MSAR Steyr Aug clone (prefer E4)
Desert Eagle in .50 AE (chrome or brushed stainless)
DPMS SASS in .308
Sage EBR stock for M1A 
Beretta M92A1 
Smith and Wesson 686 plus Talo edition (combat wood grips with finger grooves only)
FN 5.7 (black only with adjustable sights)
I can add cash, will accept cash, or will trade for multiple firearms. I will use the original MSRP of our firearms to gauge the value, not these overinflated prices which will eventually come down. I will expect cash on lower-valued trades. I will not accept your handgun that you think is worth $2K because some people are paying that. If serious please email for more detailed pics. I will travel within a reasonable distance from South Tampa for my asking price. Will sell for $1800. Thanks"

The reticle is a standard cross-hair, not Mil dot. I use factory Federal Match .308 HPBT ammo. The furthest I have shot this is 600 yards and that has been 6 or 7 years ago. The rifle and scope are perfect with no scratches and has resided in my safe.      

This gun groups at 3"" at 600 yards with premium 168 grain HPBT ammo for me.

I have had this gun/scope combination for many years, however I no longer have the original boxes. I'm sure I have the Winchester owners manual (just have to look for it).

This particular rifle is very rare. Please do your research on Mark 4 scopes and the rifle. 

There is no doubt that this combo is worth $2000. Please don't waste our time with low-ball offers. 

Thanks for looking,


MARK 4 IS SOLD. THE RIFLE IS AVAILABLE AT $950.00"

I'm really wanting some higher in pistols. I'm not too much into 1911's but would love a Sig or HK pistol in 9mm, .40, or .45. I'm also interested in anything with a factory threaded barrel. I could also use an eotech or aimpoint as well. I do not need any AR type rifles unless they are in 9mm. Feel free to offer up though, doesn't hurt to ask.

Made by Lewis Machine and Tool (LMT). These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups come in the PreBan (No Ban) configuration only, including bayonet lug, threaded barrel and A2 flash hider. These uppers are assembled, headspaced, and test fired.    These do not include bolt carrier groups. These do not include charging handles.      

Please Note: 
LMT's branded product line was developed primarily for the US Government / Professional Market. The civilian market is a secondary benefactor to this program. As such the QC standards and priorities (and features) are very different than that of a commercial market AR15 manufacturer. To the very overwhelming majority of shooters, this is a huge plus in the LMT column. It makes their product and extremely attractive option for a civilian shooter looking for a higher standard of product.


With the primary focus being a quality standard for GI sales, there are some noteworthy differences in the product as you receive it. Specific to the LMT Upper Groups, they ALL come extensively test fired from the factory. As such, every single real LMT Upper Group on the market will have significant brass, significant carbon, and handling marks on the group.   Regarding the utility of the Upper Group (everything LMT builds is focused on utility); this is a very very good thing.

I purchased this ammunition from the sportsmansguide this past November (prior to all of the gun and ammy hype). I paid 250 dollars with shipping included. The SG mistakenly shipped half WPA Poly and half Military Classic. The Military classic ammo is more expensive than the Polyformance ammo - I'm not charging any more though since it did not affect my wallet. I curently have this ammo in a nice .50 ammo can with a 40 gram reusable desiccant gel can to keep moisture out. 
There is absolutely nothing wrong with this ammo. 
I'm asking 225 dollars cash - which is a fair deal considering the current state of ammo availability, and how much this ammo is worth."
