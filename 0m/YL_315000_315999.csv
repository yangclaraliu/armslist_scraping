Both rifles are in great shape, no serious pitting, excellent bores (especially the springfield).

The Springfield is $850.
The Century / Beretta is $750.

I'd take trades plus cash for 9mm service pistols like Beretta 92fs or m9s, Sig 226, CZ 75s, Hi powers, Bersa Thunders, etc etc. Or .45 ACP 1911 type pistols or other military type rifles like mausers (98ks preferred) or enfields.

In very good condition, 65 rounds through the barrel. 
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges. Based on the full size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semi-automatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot two finger grip frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full hand grip frame. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate and highly concealable pistol.

This is not the Cheap Magpul PRS - PTS Airsoft. I've been getting emails saying that they can get it on eBay for $150. I looked them up and they are the Airsoft version, not safe on an actual AR. 

Brand new. Would prefer meet FTF near 60156. I go to the city a couple of times a week and can meet there or in between.

The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR15/M16 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock for rifles with A1/A2 fixed stocks. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock.

243,http://www.armslist.com/posts/315243,"For Sale:  Paracord Rifle Sling AR15 AK47 SKS, or Swivels","Louisville / Shelbyville, Louisville, Kentucky",$ 30,"Listed On: Thursday, February 23, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Custom made 38"" paracord parachute cord survival rifle Sling. 

I have several Black, Woodland camo, and OD Green in stock ready to sell. Other Colors are not made yet and would take a day or so to get ready.

The Universal nylon ends will fit almost any rifle. They work good on tactical rifles like the AK, SKS or AR. The nylon will also not scratch your gun like the steel clips will. The ends are made of 1"" wide 4200lb tensile strength nylon. You could pull a truck with this stuff. I use the nylon instead of leather for the added strength and will not get brittle like leather over time. The nylon is held together with a black 1/4"" chicago screw. The black finish on the screws are highly scratch resistant, seems to be a black chrome finish. Made of new USA made Mil spec government approved 550 7 strand Paracord. There is a total of about 90 feet of paracord in this sling. In an emergency you can unravel the outer 45 feet of cord and still have a useful black sling. 

The USA made paracord is manufactured to Mil-C-5040H Type III standards. This paracord has seven removable inner strands. Each of the 7 strands of 100% nylon strands are made from two-ply yarns. This is certainly not the lower quality paracord that is made from bulk fibers. Each of these 7 strands are capable of holding 50 pounds. The outer cord is made from 32 strands which are braided together and can hold 200 pounds. Add it up (50x7 + 200) and the cord can hold 550 lbs, therefore it is truly 550 paracord. 

Paracord is like duck tape and has unlimited uses only limited by your imagination. The 7 inner strands can also be removed and used for things like fishing line, or sewing thread.

I usually sell them for $50, but they are now just $29.99

I will not reply to any offer below my FIRM asking price of $500.00 for ALL of it. FTF prefered, need a valid foid and be willing to sign a bill of sale. If you break it down your getting the gun for $350.00, the ammo for 12.50 a box for the round ball=100.00, 25.00 for the HP ammo and 25 for a high cap mag. WILL NOT SEPERATE.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol. It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

ENVIS (Evader’s Night Vision Imaging System) is a rugged handheld night vision system for operators who must be prepared for covert night movement. Night movement is the best choice for evasive movement, but it is generally discouraged because of difficulty navigating in the dark. The ENVIS is the survival tool of choice, designed specifically to overcome obstacles and hazards when moving at night and successfully evade hostile territory. The ENVIS is USAF approved for flight survival vests. It is a lightweight night vision pocketscope that fits in one hand for direct viewing. It can easily convert a standard still or video camera into a high quality night vision recording device. It attaches to the objective lens threads of most cameras for temporary nighttime applications. The removable objective lens can be replaced with any C-Mount Type lens for increased range and magnification.

I love this gun, but need to buy a new bow. Huge Sacrifice I will probably regret. The sum of the parts is over $1000. 

Superior versatility in the high performance caliber 10mm: through reduced dimensions compared with the standard size Glock 20, the subcompact Glock 29 is also suitable for concealed carry. In addition to the use as backup weapon for hunting, more and more security personnel on patrol duty appreciate the comfortable firing characteristics and the grip ergonomics of the Glock 29 with a standard magazine capacity of 10 rounds. Compensated V pattern vents  work like magic with the 10mm. The power of the 10mm is comparable to a large magnum. Ask any police officer shooting a 9mm and he will probably tell you he wished he had a 10mm.

Great for people who are recoil sensitive and want the reliability of a revolver while still having 9 shots. Unlike .25 autos and .380 autos.....this costs pennies to shoot. Why pay $20 a box when you can buy 500 rounds of .22 for $20? Plus..you are more likely to shoot well with a gun you actually practice with. Let's face it...who wants to spend $100 on 100 rounds of ammo at the range?
I contacted Taurus on this gun. It's a Model#2-940031. Manufactured in 1991. I spoke with Customer Service. I asked them how many were made.....they told me they did not have production records for this model....but did comment..""Not very many"". 

A similar new Smith&Wesson....in .22 will run you $752.00 on the least expensive wedsite I could find. Plus they make them every day. If you want something unique.....here it is. Thanks"

What we have here a beautiful Flli Pietta - Made in Italy .36 cal. Black Powder Gun. Has assorted markings on it? BZ in a box, PN with a star over it, 2 crossed guns with a star over them. The cylinder says Engaged 16 May 1643 on it, says also Engraved by W.L. Oresby New York & Patent No., but no number is there? Beautiful wood grips have some initials on on side, just can not figure out what they are. I read that this is their Colt type version of this gun. Also that they can be converted to a regular shell type gun. 

Serial number is # 525461, it is a beautiful gold frame and black barrel and cylinder. When cocked the trigger has notch to use as sight when lined up with little gold ball at end of barrel. Comes with an excellent Belt & Holster, these 2 alone will cost you around $150 both are in immaculate condition. Overall, she is all in georgous condition. A little bar knocks out to remove the cylinder, 

I'm told this is a cap and ball type blackpowder gun, a 6 shooter. Solid, well mad and feels great in the hand. Personally I love this thing , but one I don't do Black Powder, two I don't have the money to convert it to a real bullet shooting cowboy gun, and third I would really rather have something I can actually use to carry or what-ever. #399

TC Encore Pro Hunter Predator in 22-250
This an excellent TC rifle with a user adjustable Swing Hammer, Pro Hunter Flex-Tech Stock, Pro Hunter Flex-Tech Forend and 28"" Fluted Pro Hunter Barrel in Realtree Max-1 Camouflage. I added a forum recommended ""Mike Bellms"" TC HD #50 hammer spring for improved primer strike (although I had zero issues with the original myself). I also recently added a ""Nikon Coyote Special"" 4.5-14x40 Rifle Scope w/BDC reticle, ARD, Scope Covers, ""Dead Nutz"" TC Encore 1pc Scope Mount and ""Claw"" Sling - all purchased brand new and in matching Max-1 camouflage. Original TC Max-1 scope Base, Hammer Spring, TC Encore Rifle Shipping Box and Nikon Scope Box included if you want them. I would rate the rifle at 95% condition as there are a few small marks on the camo from normal use. I also have a small box full of odds and ends (all TC Encore related) such as spare springs, assortment of new forend screws, new in package trigger return spring, spring pliers, original springs, etc. that I will throw in as well.

Don't know what a CETME is?  Google is your friend.  

The CETME was the precursor to the HK91 - when Germany went stupid before the war the company up and moved to South America.  Or Spain - I forget.  Perfected the CETME.  Issued to lots of countries as thier main battle rifle.
After the war they returned to Germany and became H&K.  and produced the H&K91.

THIS IS NOT A PIECE OF JUNK POUNDED TOGETHER BY THE MONKEYS AT CENTURY ARMS IN THE '80'S!!!!

This is an early Hesse receiver...it's a daily shooter.  I stand behind it.

I painted the stock and forearm a Mossy Oak type of camo for deer hunting.  ( yes with the 5 round magazine).

You get the rifle, an extra set of green stocks, and about 10 or 12 fully loaded 20 round magazines."

Comes with original factory accessories, and factory 5 round mag.  Bought with intentions of converting, but decided to go in a different direction.  Selling for what I have in it, $750.00, period.  Low ball offers will be ignored.  First come, first served.

Edit:  On 2-25 I added a pic of the original purchase reciept, showing this item is NOT overpriced.  If you want this item, it will cost you $750.00, period.  If you feel that you can pick one up TODAY, LOCALLY, for less, then I urge you to do so, and not try to extort a lower price with threats of flagging this ad.

Edit:  On 03/01, I am lowering the asking price to $725.00.  I will split the difference on the tax you would pay if you were to find one in stock locally and have to pay (as shown on the pic of the reciept).  I will keep this ad on here for a few more days, and then it will go into the safe.  Buy it now, and you won't have to wait to MAYBE get one in the future.....

Edit:  On 03/03, I am dropping the price to an even $700, the FINAL price drop.  For those of you that are sitting on the fence, watching to see how low the price will go; this is it.  I will not go any cheaper - you couldn't pick one up locally for less, after taxes and any other charges (shipping, FFL transfer, etc.).
As such, I will keep this ad up for a few more days, and if no one wants it, I will keep it for myself.  To sell it for any less would be insane on my part."

When Ambush Firearms decided to pull the trigger on the Ambush 300AAC Blackout, we had the hunter in mind. Keeping with our philosophy of tailoring a rifle to the needs of the sportsman, like the 6.8, the 300AAC Blackout is lightweight, modular, utilizes a Picatinny Rail system and adjustable butt-stock. Never before seen with the AR platform, the Ambush 300AAC Blackout fires 7.62 x 35 rounds while remaining compatible with the standard M4 Bolt Carrier Group and existing magazines.
