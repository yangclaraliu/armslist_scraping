Ribber Grip Exclusive Taurus orgonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.

Taurus Security System 
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems. To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

Fiber Optic Sight
Light gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer the shooter the highly visible dot created by the end of the fiber optic

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, and is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest.

If you find a gun online from out of state you want to buy then I will act as your transfer point and get the gun brought into the state for $20. All you need to do is buy the gun and then go to www.hhbguns.com and fill out a transfer request and thats it. I will call you when I have the gun.

I am a Class 3 dealer as well. I can handle all of your firearms needs.

I refinish guns as well with Duracoat and Ceracoat . With over 600 colors I can make your gun match your personality. The sky is the limit as to what I can paint a gun. You name it I can do it. I have a custom airbrush artist on staff.

Want to sell a gun and not having luck on here? I offer consignment sales for you. You bring me the gun and I do everything for you to list it nationally on Gunbroker. When it sells I will cut you a business check for sale price minus 9% for my commission and Gunbroker fees. Don't pay local shops 10%+ and then only have it sit in their shop to see a few customers. Gunbroker gets millions of views daily. I have plenty of satisfied customers. I have sold guns from $150-$82,000. In four years I have had maybe 4 guns that did not sell. Just to give you an idea...Another local gunshop in charleston appraised a LC smith shotgun at $4500 and it sat in their shop for a month. He brought it to me and I appraised it at $6800. We listed it on gunbroker for $6500 and 14 days later it sold for $8825.

Built it up to be a good small game / night hunting gun but I don’t really get to shoot it as much as I would like, so I would rather trade it for something else. The gun has a match grade precision barrel and is pretty damn accurate (shoots better than I had expected it to) has no recoil whatsoever so it’s really fun to practice quick follow up shots. You can shoot this one all day long and never get sick of it, great gun all around.

I would rather trade for a different gun then sell it but if you made me a good offer I would take it. 

All together I have close to $900 into this one and I have the receipts for everything to prove it.

I bought everything from the store and not online so please don’t send me emails telling me what it’s worth or how much you could build it for im sure you could do it cheaper but I don’t really care. I just want to break even or come close

They are closed for a few days and I'm concerned my rifle that was shipped to them will be returned due to them being unavailble to sign for it.  These guys run an amazing shop and are super helpful, it was just bad timing on my shipping and them running out of stuff to sell (and so temporarily closing their shop).  

I've tried the listed numbers for both shops and their website is a dead end right now.  

Again, these guys have been awesome to work with and I don't want this to reflect poorly on them.  

I would greatly appreciate any help that could be provided.  

Also, when they do get restocked I think they would be worth spending some money at; the south end of the Twin Cities was without a great gun shop for too long to let these guys struggle.  Besides, Ken knows AR's and has helped me out without thinking twice.  He's honorable and knowledgable - that combination doesn't happen often.

The barrel is a Stainless steel 1:9 Twist 16"" HBAR with the standard A2 flashhider. It is marked as having a 5.56 chamber. The upper reciever is unmarked except for the foundry broken A, and I'm not sure of the origin. I bought it second hand, but it appeared to be unfired when I got it. The guy that sold it to me said it was a PSA build, but it is unmarked so I'm not sure if that is correct. I've put exactly 150 rounds through it for iron sight zero and to zero a Acog. The PSA Classic lower build kit includes everything to build out your stripped lower reciever, including a milspec buffer tube, PSA 5 position stock, buffer spring and carbine buffer, It is new in the package.

I switched to a different set up and I was going to assemble another AR with it, but I can't afford to pay the going prices for a stripped lower right now for another toy.... I figure that someone else here could use it. 

I'm asking $425 for everything FTF in the Mebane, Chapel Hill, Greensboro areas. I highly prefer not to ship. I will consider equal value trades, however I don't really have any in mind."

Other than that these lights work great and are super bright. Both are ready for remote pressure switches as well. They both have been in the War overseas one in Kuwait and the other in Afghanistan and have the battle scars to prove it. These lights are completely sealed water tight and are very shock proof. Being sold as parts or for repair since it wouldn't take much if you know about these lights.

The Glock 19 is effectively a reduced-size Glock 17, called the ""Compact"" by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19 has a barrel and pistol grip that are shorter by approximately 12 mm (0.5 in) compared to the Glock 17 and uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, with available capacities of 10, 17, 19, and 33 rounds. To preserve the operational reliability of the short recoil system, the mass of the slide remains the same as in the Glock 17 from which it is derived. With the exception of the slide, frame, barrel, locking block, recoil spring, guide rod, and slide lock spring, all of the other components are interchangeable between the models 17 and 19."

Take a ride on the GSX-R600 and you'll quickly become aware of a highly developed sporting tool. On a particular solo run on the Gixxer, the man/machine interface was direct and inspirational, not wanting of a dollop more power or a scintilla of a quicker flick. Its available power is plentiful and the gearbox and slipper clutch works seamlessly at the command of your fingers and toes. The twisty road ahead is consumed to the accompaniment of a beautiful scream from the injected Four. It's difficult to imagine an experience much better.
