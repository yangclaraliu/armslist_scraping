First off, this gun was ordered from Bushmaster just after the original AWB expired putting it made in '04-05. Bushmaster was a much better company back then under their previous ownership and turned out some great rifles. This is one of them. 

The commercial buttstock and buffer tube has been upgraded to a Milspec tube and a Magpul CTR adjustable buttstock. The gas key on the bolt carrier group has been properly staked on the bolt carrier group.

The detachable carry handle has been replaced with a Magpul MBUS flip up rear sight and a genuine Aimpoint PRO that was purchased new by me about 6 months ago. The current battery in it still has about 2 years of constant-on life left.

The factory grip has been replaced with a Magpul MIAD. The trigger guard has been replaced with a Magpul MOE. A Magpul BAD lever is also in place to assist with the bolt.

The front handguards have been replaced with a Daniel Defense Omega 7.0 free float rail. A bobro short verticle fore grip is in place.

The barrel is a factory 14.5"" chrome lined M4 profile with a permanently pinned flash suppressor giving you the very shortest possible legal length. This was ordered from bushmaster this way, it's not some aftermarket hack job.

One 30 round PMag is included.

Brand new, never been fired other than test shots at the factory.  This one has a weaver style scope base and an Osprey Red Dot on top.  These are fantastic firearms.  I have another one that have I fired more than 25,000 rounds through and it still works perfectly… and is remarkably accurate.  I hate to sell this one since I never got to shoot it but I am needing to downsize.  
I will sell the Mark III and scope base for $425 (that is cheaper than you can buy one new with the taxes and background check).  If you want the red dot (I just looked online and the best deal I could find on it was $69 before shipping) I will sell both for $475.

Chrome lined bore and chamber now standard
An integrated Picatinny rail for mounting different sight systems.
The forend folds down to form a bipod for increased accuracy.
The stock can store spare magazines. Two 10 round magazines or one 20/30 round magazine will fit.
The stock and trigger mechanism can be folded forward for added safety and to facilitate secure storage or carry under extreme conditions."

It is an ""I"" cut stock with a type 1 Narrow band, hand guard is 2-rivet with what appears to me is the original deep groove, I am guessing it is pretty early. 

It appears that it was originally a high wood stock that was cut to Low wood early in it's lifetime as there is still a slight ""step"" left from where it was a high wood stock (see left part of last pic). 

Has original Underwood Butt plate, recoil lug is parked ""PI"".

In excellent overall condition other than some chipping around the I Cut from use, and one small chip at the bottom very the stock meets the butt plate.

Price includes stock, hand guard, butt plate and recoil plate.

Will ship UPS or USPS to other areas as long as buyer pays shipping cost."

The Huldra 5.56 Midlength Evo-Slank 14.5 Upper (Ultra Lite Piston Upper) is a .625"" lite profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The mid-length piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. With the combination of the .625 ultra lite pencil barrel, the Samson Evolution hand guard, and the new reduced radius permanently affixed flash hider, we now have the lightest dedicated piston upper on the market. With the patented Adams Arms piston system, you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler and longer than any other AR upper you own."

Anti-Gun Representatives Introduce First Wave of Bills in U.S. House

The new Congress has begun, and so has the fight for our right to keep and bear arms. Based on bills introduced on the first day of the 113th Congress, we clearly face the most serious threat to our fundamental Second Amendment rights in the last twenty years, and law-abiding gun owners need to act now to ward off an unprecedented onslaught on our rights.

While introduction of Senate bills won’t start until January 22, press reports indicate some of the targets of anti-gun Representatives in the U.S. House. (Please note that the links below will not have complete information on these bills for a few days.)

Anti-gun Democrat Carolyn McCarthy (N.Y.) introduced four bills:

H.R. 138 would ban transfer or possession of standard capacity magazines, targeting those that hold more than 10 rounds. 

H.R. 141 would impose federal regulation of gun shows. This legislation would require background checks on all gun sales at guns shows, and impose addition federal regulations on these traditional local events.

H.R. 142 would ban Internet or mail order ammunition purchases, require a federal license for all ammunition sellers and mandate reporting of “bulk” ammo purchases. The record keeping and licensing requirements included here will place a serious burden on buyers and sellers and vastly increase the cost of ammunition—which is why the previous federal recordkeeping requirements were repealed in the 1980s.
McCarthy also introduced H.R. 137, which according to press reports would create a national database of people “prohibited” from buying a firearm. Since the National Instant Criminal Background Check System is already supposed to be just such a database, the purpose of the legislation is currently unclear.

Anti-gun Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.) has reintroduced his legislation to ban all private firearm transfers.  In the 113th Congress it is now H.R. 21. This bill would make it illegal, for example, to give a firearm as a gift, even to a close family member, without involving a federally licensed dealer.

Reps. Bobby Rush (D- Ill.) and Rush Holt (D-N.J.) have each introduced gun registration bills, H.R. 34 and H.R. 117 respectively. Federal law has prohibited the establishment of a firearms owner registration system for decades.  These bills would override these longstanding protections of gun owners’ privacy.

While each of these bills is a serious threat to our rights, we know that this is just the beginning.  We are sure to see semi-auto bans and many other anti-gun bills in the next few weeks.

These bills have just been introduced, so we will soon be assessing their full impact, but gun owners should act now to let their U.S. Representative know that you oppose all these anti-gun bills. 

As noted earlier, Senate bills can’t be introduced until January 22, and we will report on those bills as soon as we have information. However, do not wait to contact your Senators and tell them you oppose all new restrictions on your Second Amendment rights. 

To find contact information for your elected officials, you can use the ""Write Your Reps"" feature at www.NRAILA.org.  You can also reach your U.S. Representative at REDACTED, and your U.S. Senators at REDACTED.

And of course, keep watching the Grassroots Alert for more details as we enter a truly trying time for all who care about the Right to Keep and Bear Arms.

In addition to the contact options given in the NRA release you can also 
write house speaker Boehner and demand that these bills NOT be allowed to the House floor for a vote. Anyone can write the speaker, you do not need to be in his district or even in his state. Suggested text follows at the end of this post if you agree with it, use it as is, if not change whatever you don't agree with. You can also use it for your regular rep and senator just snip the parts specific to the Speaker of the House and keep the rest. You can do this in about 1% of the time it now takes to find a single reasonably priced high cap mag. Just fill out the contact form, cut and paste, or pick up the phone and call, or, better yet do both.

You can also use the NRA's write your reps tool linked below to contact your local congressman/woman. You can get the contact info here just by entering a zip code:

SUGGESTED TEXT TO THE SPEAKER

Dear Speaker Boehner,

I am writing you regarding the numerous gun control measures currently being circulated in congress including, but not limited to, those placing restrictions on the sale of ammunition, those  placing severe restrictions on magazines over 10 rounds in capacity, and  those attempting to regulate so called ""assault weapons "" to a degree greater than already regulated by federal law.   The magazines in question are used by 10's of millions of law abiding Americans, so are the ""assault weapons"" and ammunition at issue in these bills. I STRONGLY oppose additional gun control measures. They do not make us safer and do nothing but disarm and hamstring those who obey laws, while criminals simply ignore the laws in their entirety. A magazine ban and further ""assault weapon"" regulation will do NOTHING to prevent crime or mass shootings, which are a statistically rare event, and have essentially 0 effect on our overall violent crime rate. After studying the effects of the 1994 ban on ""assault"" weapons and high capacity magazines the USDOJ concluded in part: “At best, the assault weapons ban can have only a limited effect on total gun murders, because the banned weapons and magazines were never involved in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders."" The time required to change a magazine is trivial. I can do it in about a second and I'm slow. Further, according to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, in 2011, rifles, including the ""assault"" variety were used in only 2.55% of homicides. Other years are similar. The criminal use of these guns is simply already miniscule and disproportionate reporting of the small number of high profile  incidents in which they are misused does not change that. 

The 10's of millions of law abiding gun owners in this country are NOT the problem and we are frankly becoming very tired of being treated as though we are. The real problem is that these horrific shootings occur in so called ""gun free"" zones where the victims, or, in the case of children, those responsible for protecting them, are disarmed and unable to mount any effective defense. When this is the case, the weapon used, and how many rounds of ammunition it holds, is frankly trivial. Any reasonably effective weapon can be used to kill large numbers of unarmed and helpless people.

The short term, direct solution to these senseless and horrific acts is ARMED security in our schools NOW. Law enforcement officers are already in many schools and they should be in all of them. If the individuals who commit these acts knew that they would be confronted by an immediate armed response the number of attempts at these sort of mass killings would decrease dramatically. Compare the Sandy Hook tragedy, where nobody but the killer was armed, to the 1997 Pearl Mississippi school shooting where Vice Principal Joel Myrick was able to retrieve his handgun from his truck (it was illegal for him to possess or carry it in the school) and apprehend the shooter, Luke Woodham without Myrick firing a single shot. Luke Woodham's admitted plan after attacking his high school, was to go to the local Jr. High and continue his rampage there. Myrick stopped that plan cold. Unfortunately, there was no ARMED Joel Myrick at Sandy Hook. In another incident, in 2001, senior Jason Hoffman opened fire at Granite Hills High School in El Cajon, California. Hoffman wounded five people before being shot and incapacitated by, ARMED school resource officer (a police officer) Richard Agundez. An ARMED response to these incidents works, when it is in place. These individuals may not be afraid to die but they are afraid of arrest and prison. This is why they typically commit suicide rather than be taken into custody. The arguments against having the same armed police officers who enforce the laws and provide protection in the rest of society in schools are absurd. That includes the arguments against the cost. If we have money to provide 10's of billions in foreign aid to countries who's inhabitants routinely shout ""Death to America"" in the streets and burn our flag, then we have money to secure our schools and protect our children.

The long term solution is to improve our mental health systems and address the real problem: The tendency toward violence in our society.

I do not believe that additional gun control legislation should be allowed to come to a vote. This is an obvious ploy to play on people's emotions immediately following a national tragedy. I am asking that you, as speaker, block these measures from coming to the house floor. The Senate routinely blocks legislation from being voted upon, in fact Harry Reid does so with monotonous regularity, and there is no reason the House should not do the same with regard to bills like these. If the measure does come to a vote, please know this: American gun owners are a large part of the GOP constituency. You cannot win elections without us and as one of these gun owners I want this legislation defeated by any and all means at your disposal.

Sincerely,

For purists out there I also have the original wood stock, unfortunately the original pistol grip seems to have been misplaced. I am the original owner and bought it off of AIM or SOG several years ago. I have used it moderately at the range probably 200<500 rounds. It shoots great the only caveat was that it did have a feeding problem with HP(probably magazine issue). I have mostly fired wolf fmj and it eats that up.  It comes with a TAPCO mag and a steel mag. Also comes with cleaning kit and oil can.  

Will entertain all offers, worst I say is no, or you don't hear back. Any potential buyer must be willing to show me their permit to purchase or carry and a drivers license so I can make sure they are over 21."

If you know anything about glocks, you know that the gen 3 g19 and g23 are better than the gen 4 because of the spring issues with the new models.  You'll also know that these handguns are about to be banned under the new legislation, along with the standard capacity 15rd magazines - 2 of which come with this pistol.  There's only one place in Hampton Roads that can even get these pistols, and they go within an afternoon, so I feel that the market value has dramatically increased in our area.  This pistol was bought brand new less than two weeks ago, and has never been fired or carried.  I'm selling because I'm buying as much AR/AK/Class III as I can before the bans go into effect.  Serious inquiries only, more pictures can be found on glock's website or through several other resources across the web. Two VA ID's required to purchase - Driver's License and Concealed Permit/Passport/Military Orders will suffice."
