with this sale you will be getting exactly 950 rounds of WOLF 154gr SP ammo (kind you can't get anymore) which I removed from the boxes a while back and separated into ziplocks and into a box.

As far as  ammo, if you can find it (black box Wolf, Non-corrosive, non-re-loadable), it goes now for about 40c a round (as it is the best hunting weight), before it disappeared it was $469MSRP for 1000rounds; so I think this is a fair price for a quick sale

$300.00 (firm) - meet Face to Face, willing to drive up to 20miles from Neenah, WI 54956 (So South to  South Oshkosh or North to Kaukauna as far as HWY41 goes)."

Its a PSL built by Tennessee Guns. These rifles are also known as ROMAK-3's and FPK Dragunovs(they are not real Dragunovs though). It comes with an illuminated(red) scope pictured below and one magazine(I only have one). I also have a barrel mounted bipod that I'll include in the deal for free if you want it.

I'm not sure the exact type of scope but it says its made in Belarus, is 8x42B and has a switch to illuminate the reticle(up on, down off). I also have the rubber eye piece that goes on the back of this scope but I took it off because I wear glasses. Obviously the eye piece will be on it when its shipped. The scope also has 3 brand new batteries but someone took off and lost the LED emitter at one of our shoots. However those can be easily found online for ~$10-15.

Other than some dust, this gun is pretty much brand new. I have not fired more than 40 rounds through this gun. From my account though to give you some personal insight on this gun, it never jammed, misfired, or gave me any grief on that brief moment at the range. Anywhere I bring this gun it gets eyeballed, so it's definitely something to be proud of. 

The only reason I'm selling this gun is because I am starting an AR Pistol Project and I am going to use this money to partially finance it.

Certainly one of the most unusual-looking guns to come out is the Mossberg 500 Chainsaw. Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories.

           The Daewoo Precision Industries DR200 is an assault rifle of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces (know as the K2), manufactured by Daewoo Precision Industries. It is a shoulder-fired, gas-operated,piston driven, semi automatic assault rifle that feeds from a 20 or 30 round AR magazine and is chambered for .223. The K2 replaced the M16A1 rifle in South Korean military use[3] in 1984.[4] The K2 formally entered South Korean military service in 1987. The operating system utilizes a piston driven upper that has a rotating locking bolt like the AR-15. I.E. it has an AK-47 like gas system and an AR type bolt giving it the best of both worlds.      my DR200 has a great gas piston system 223 rifle, works every time under the most extreme conditions, Daewoo DR-200 (semi-auto civilian version in .223 Remington), note the ""post-1994 ban"" thumb hole non-folding butt stock, required by American Federal laws at the time, but is no longer required as of 2004. 
   this is one of the best 223 platforms on the market bar none, if you have never owned one or shot one you are missing out for sure... they were doing gas piston rifles in the early 80's and made them dam fine i might add, it is like a FAL, an AK, and an m16, well all of the reliable parts, none of the bad things, you can only find these things from private party, or gun dealer who got one on a trade in, as they do not make them any more not for a while, but the part are all over the web ie daewoorifleparts.com  if you know ware to look... not that they ever break, as i said look for your self online in any forum out there, if the DR-200 is mentioned, it is being praised, for being a great all around battle 223 for civilians, very nice ask any knowledgeable gun dealer they can tell you too... You can also check out Stormwerkz for rails and stock adapters.   call me at REDACTED or REDACTED i may be willing to trade it for the right rifle/pistol/shotgun/cash or combination of the like, i have no complaints what so ever with either rifle, they are great just seeing what offer are out there, please email pics of trades to REDACTED thanks for looking..."

If you have an older model PS90 you no doubt have a white-ring sight.

Black in daytime and red in the dark, and install in about 30 seconds via two allen screws in the same sight housing your existing sights mount to. See attached pics, can your white reticle do this against a light target? If not, consider upgrading to this.

I won’t try to low-ball you, I know what these weapons are worth and will gladly pay a fair price. However, if you’ve fired it and taken good care of it that is ok, but don’t expect ‘new out of the box’ price.

If not new, as close to new as I can find. I am meticulous about the condition of my weapons so if yours has been fired, that’s ok, but a new rifle warrants a new price, a used weapon warrants a used price.

I won’t try to low-ball you, I know what these weapons are worth and will gladly pay a fair price. However, if you’ve fired it and taken good care of it that is ok, but don’t expect ‘new out of the box’ price.

I don’t care if it has any accessories or not, if it does we can negotiate a fair price for the package if need be.

I am in New Orleans, La and have a FFL holder that it can be shipped to on my dime if necessary. If close enough we can meet as well.

 These are signal, distress, hand combo flare and smoke. These are emergency signaling devices. On one side is orange smoke for daytime use. On the other side is an extremely bright flare for nightime use. These would be great for almost any outdoor activity including; camping, hunting, boating, RVing, traveling, etc.. Perfect for a bugout bag, lost prevention, or location notification in day or night. To activate either end requires pulling a ring, which breaks a seal, which in turn ignites the signaling device. 1 for $10 or 12 for $100+ free container. 12 signaling devices come in a airtight, watertight, military grade aluminum container. These are extremely rare and from what research I have done appear to be made for maritime, air, & special forces type personnel due to their compactability. Manufactured by Kilgore Co. I have personally tried about six of these and they work flawlessly despite being more than 20 yrs old. I Prefer NOT SHIP THESE, though I will consider it provided laws are abided by!!"

Semi-automatic; 7-shot magazine; 3-3/4 inch barrel; 7 inch overall length; fixed sights, grip safety; hard rubber stocks; blued finish.  I inherited this pistol from my father, but have never fired it.  It has been in my family as long as I can remember (50+ years), spending that time in its case on a shelf in my parents’ bedroom closet at their Northern California home.  My mother and I recall only one occasion when my father fired this pistol with a family friend who was a knowledgeable shooter and had acreage where this could be done safely.  I made no effort to clean or polish the gun prior to taking the photos and I have not field stripped or disassembled it at any time.  The slide and trigger action appear to operate smoothly and without evident excessive play or drag.  The finish overall appears to be in good shape with minor wear to the bluing in a few places (ridge of slide, lower front of slide near muzzle, left side of trigger guard where latch in holster engages weapon) and some slight surface scratches in a few places.  I did my best to capture these with the camera.  The rubber grips are sound but a bit loose.  I would tighten them but they appear to require a tool other than an ordinary screwdriver.  To the best of my (admittedly limited) knowledge, this is a highly original, lightly used Model 1908 .380 Hammerless Pocket Pistol.  $775/best offer in cash FTF sale with legally qualified WI resident.

While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories.

Up for sale is my Sub2K, in 40 cal with Glock 22 grips. It has seen roughly 500-600 rounds fired and is in excellent condition. 

I have installed the factory stock extension, the Tacticool bolt tube cover, charging handle cover, and recoil buffer, the Hogue Handall grip sleeve, Kel-Tec quadrail, Magpul AFG1, Magpul Railcovers and a Sightmark Ultrashot QD Reflex Sight (Red Dot). I also have a HiPoint front sight that I was going to install but I will just include it in stead. 

It will include ONE G22, 10 rd magazine and will also include the factory forend.

As of this posting, the Reflex Sight has never been used and is brand new!

I will also include a small RedHead gun-bag that fits the rifle, sight, and ammo perfectly.

I have over $800 total invested in this awesome little carbine. It has performed flawlessly since I broke it in and the only potentially negative thing worth mentioning is a small crack in the front sight, but it does not seem to be spreading or effecting the weapon at all. Email me for pics of crack.

Price is $700 firm. I don't need to sell this, just thinking about getting something new, so don't even bother lowballing me. Also, I will not split up any of the accessories. I may consider selling just the Reflex Sight for $110.

Local Tennessee buyer preferred. Please have TN drivers license or ID.

I will ship but only FFL to FFL and buyer pays all shipping and transfer fees."

If not new, as close to new as I can find. I am meticulous about the condition of my weapons so if yours has been fired, that’s ok, but a new rifle warrants a new price, a used weapon warrants a used price.

I won’t try to low-ball you, I know what these weapons are worth and will gladly pay a fair price. However, if you’ve fired it and taken good care of it that is ok, but don’t expect ‘new out of the box’ price.

I don’t care if it has any accessories or not, if it does we can negotiate a fair price for the package if need be.

I am in New Orleans, La and have a FFL holder that it can be shipped to on my dime if necessary. If close enough we can meet as well.

1 Good shooting fair condition Remington 1100 12 Ga in tactical configuration 18.5 in barrell with pistolgrip speed feed stock (the one with out the Shell feeders on the side) and a beefy synthetic forend This one has been ported so it will shoot bird shot inspite of the shorter barrell. 



2 A whole other Remington 1100 for parts. In original configuration fair condition glossy stock long barrel and all for parts (as some one has drilled several small holes in the mag tube area) Can probably be fixed if you know what you are doing. This one is missing the mag tube cap and return spring. Trigger and bolt assemblies are complete and also has good reciever, stocks, and sporting length barrel.

You can swap stocks and the barrel and have either tactical or sporting configuration and back again. Sort of a 2 for 1, or fix the parts gun and have one of each.



Both for a fair condition well functioning mini Draco.

There is a large outer ring and inner dot that is projected onto the front reflective glass simply by being outside in the existing ambient light. Even on a heavy overcast day, this sight works perfectly!! This is the Model 47 and it is stamped ""patent applied for"". It was made by the Swain Nelson Company of Glenview, Illinois. 

Developed from technology used in WWII bomb-sights, it is a fore-runner of the red-dot, hologram and reflex-type weapon sights popular today.  Allied aircraft had similar sights using the exact same principal, and shot down many axis war planes using their modified Nydar Sights. The inner dot represents 12"" inches at 50 yards, while the outer ring is positioned so that the ring itself is always 24"" inches from the inner dot. This makes the Nydar Gun Sight the PERFECT ""shotgun"" hunting sight. 

There are adjustments for windage and elevation, the sight is mounted on a base plate and that is able to be manipulated for front to rear and side to side movement, once it is zero'd you lock it down.

One of the new features includes the introduction of our new one-piece fully machined mainspring / magwell combination cut from a 2 ½"" block of tool steel. Rather than coming to a sharp point at the base of the grip, the integrated mainspring housing / magwell is rounded for comfort while not sacrificing any grip length. It assists in reducing print thru clothing while carrying concealed. You will not find a stronger part.

Sights are the new Heinie Ledge which allows the rear sight to be used to cycle the slide with one hand should need arise.

Three ball-radius cuts run the full length of the slide top to direct your eyes quickly to the front sight.

The rear cocking serrations are a series of eight ball radius cuts per side instead of our normal serration pattern. The rear of the slide is hand-serrated at 40lpi which matches the rear of the Heinie Ledge Sight. The barrel bushing is an extra thick variety which is chamfered around the edges. The front of the slide has been recessed where the front cocking serrations would normally be and the barrel crowned to complete the custom look.

This Kimber is used in excellent condition and shows a minor amount of normal finish wear, especially on the edges. The bore is clean, bright, shiny and in excellent condition.  It includes the original factory box, all original paperwork, the all-important ""take-down"" tool, Trijicon night sights (less than 8 months old) and 2 Kimber 7-round magazines.

Chambered in .45ACP this Ultra Carry II has a 7+1 capacity.  It also features a 3"" barrel and left-side thumb safety.  All steel slide and aluminum alloy frame so weight is only about 25 ounces empty.  This is a lot of gun in a very small, easily carried and concealable package.

In my opinion the Ultra Carry is one of the finest concealed carry handguns available.  This has been my personal carry gun for some time and it's been immaculately maintained.  I've shot it plenty enough to know it's reliable with ANY type and brand of ammunition.

If you're looking for an excellent, durable and reliable concealed carry handgun you'd be hard-pressed to find a better one.

I'm selling it only to upgrade to another Kimber.

It is believed that fewer than 6,000 survived destruction during the UN-led disarming initiative after the Balkan wars.  Albania itself was an isolated western bastion of Maoism, and thus at odds with its Soviet-influenced neighbors.  By 1961, relations were completely broken off with the USSR and other Warsaw Pact nations, leaving China as Albania's only ally.  By 1978, even China had cut off aid (perhaps explaining why manufacture of these rifles ceased?)  Albania's SKS rifle was distinctive.  The Albanian SKS has a longer handguard than most SKS's, an AK-style charging handle, a buttplate with two trapdoors instead of one, a Y shaped folding spike bayonet instead of the more traditional X shaped cruciform, a differently-contoured magazine other SKS's, and a sling swivel on the left side of the buttstock. 
 This SKS (Samozariadnyia Karabina Simonova, or Simonov Self-loading Carbine) was manufactured in 1970.  All numbers match, and the carbine is NOT import-marked.
 I have included a pic of it above a Yugoslavian SKS for comparison."

I have for sale a Chip McCormick 1911.  I can't even find one of these for sale...anywhere.  Here's the story as I understand it.

This gun has sat in the safe of a good friend of mine for at least 12 years.  He took it in trade for some body work he did for a customer, and has never shot it. Now he wants to sell it.  I have spent 2 days researching this gun and have learned a lot about it.

In the 1990s, Chip McCormick offered matching frame and slide kits.  These were expensive match grade parts that gunsmiths could buy and assemble their own custom 1911.  They came with Kart barrels.  Because of the cost of these, most were built with high end parts.

This is a low serial number example of the Chip McCormick 1911.  This gun has a CM trigger set that feels like a million bucks.  The Kart barrel has a little pitting near the bushing, but that's just from being stored.  The bushing is very tight, and I suspect that this thing will be quite the little tack driver.  The backstrap has beautiful checkering that continues up the grip safety.  The finish is parkerized, with wear only visible in one spot on the slide.

Chip McCormick helped get Kimber off the ground, and if you look, this 1911 has several design cues that show this to be an ancestor to the Kimber.  

For those of you who appreciate simplicity, the only markings on this 1911 are the serial number, and ""Chip McCormick Corp, Austin TX USA""

It also has some custom laser etched grips with very deep etching.  The grips are in perfect condition.  Take a look in the pictures.  The slide rails, feedramp and hammer show basically zero wear.  I don't think this has been fired much at all.

Make a cash offer.  No trades for this one.  Prefer FTF, but would ship to your FFL for $30."
