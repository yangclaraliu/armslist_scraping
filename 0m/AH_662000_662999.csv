The upper housing is serial numbered for 1997 (s/n 246-93XXX)  with an original trigger housing that has been enhanced to take the slack out with about a 4lb pull that is all metal and not plastic.  The slide has a polish job and everything works quite smoothly, smoother than any stock 10/22 you'll try.  The rifle comes with one original 10 round magazine.  The upper housing, slide and trigger are all original Ruger that have either been polished or enhanced for better operation.  The upper and trigger are housed in a very nice Boyd's Thumb-hole Target Stock and the bullet travels down a Butler Creek .920 Carbon Fiber 18"" bull Barrel.  The stock is full floating with a beautiful laminate wood grain.  The Tasco scope works well and sets on a Leupold mount.  The last time this rifle was shot I was able to shot a 10 round group at 100 yards 2"" in diameter with CCI mini-mags and you can drive nails with this gun at 50 and 75 yards with CCI Stinger ammo.  There is well over my $500 asking price invested in this rifle so I believe my asking price is quite fair, if you don't think so please look up what a metal trigger housings cost with work done to it, buying a bull barrel and thumb-hole stock  and try building your own for anything near this price.  But as usual all reasonable cash offers will be entertained and low-ballers will be ignored.   I'm not looking to trade as I have found a different rifle I want to purchase.  If I do take a trade it will be only for something that I can sell quickly for cash at less than a retail price.  Send me your contact information and I'll get back to you as quickly as I can.

I know, ridiculous... but the most fun I have had with a gun by far.

It was born as a shiny innocent Marlin 60W with a 22"" micro groove barrel. As I watched it get older, it's body started going through changes and grew into an ATI fiberforce dragunov stock. 
Next, it got taller, as all little ones do, by standing on a precision-grade bipod with spring-loaded folding legs made from durable aircraft-grade aluminum and steel and towering 11"". 
Ahh how they grow up.
 However, as it went through it's awkwardness, I quickly came to realize that it needed glasses. We fought back and forth over this as it did not want anything awkward as to avoid being made fun of by other rifles. Finally, we compromised with the sexy sleek design of a BSA 6-24x Mildot scope that is waterproof, shock proof, and fog proof. Of course it wanted the 4"" sunshade and who am I to say no to such an adorable little rifle. 

Now that it is all grown up, it needs to venture out into the world and make it's own mark. I know it will make the best decisions possible in it's journey as it is a very dependable, reliable, and accurate little whipper snapper."

I have a 1937 S/42 Mauser made German Luger in 9mm. This gun is COMPLETELY original with ALL matching numbers (small parts, grips, etc) and yes I even have the original magazine with the matching numbers and stamp as well. As you can see for yourself this gun is in amazing condition, and surpasses the quality of most I have seen.  The gun also comes with another magazine and an authentic Luger holster made in 1940. Just remember this gun is like a classic hot rod, you won't be able to go out and just find them, and good examples like mine only appreciate in value every year, and are becoming harder and HARDER to find, all the stockpiles and secret caches are gone and most of the surviving pieces are mismatched numbers, don't have all the original pieces, or look like they were dragged behind a truck for miles. 
DO YOUR HOMEWORK please before offering me, these things go around $1500 in half the quality of what I have, look at all the sites and speak to people, with all matching numbers, the original magazine, and in this condition most people ask between $2000-$2500 as this is the Mauser made S/42 that is the sought after model and the one I have is what every collector looks for in every aspect (condition, quality, desirability).

Don't be afraid to shoot me an offer I am looking for a Springfield M1A (I will trade straight across for any model M1A) , AR-10's, AK's, long distance shooters (308's with bull barrels, etc) quality handguns (sig sauer, springfield xdm, etc) or even a trained bird dog, or a couple good pupppies to train myself. these are some ideas of things I am looking for, but as always I am open to trades and offers just let me know what you have, and the worst I will say is no.  If you prefer to just purchase it that is fine, just shoot me a reasonable offer and we will talk her out.  Thank you

In closing, please ONLY SERIOUS INQUIRIES I am a military man and a single father, I have no time to waste and would appreciate it if you are unsure to just wait to contact me until you are sure, thanks."

Yeah, there's a catch, but there's always a catch for a gun this cheap.
Now, the details:
This is a 1909 German Mauser chambered in caliber .30-06.
On the receiver is stamped: MAUSER MODELO ARGENTINO 1909
And beside that: DEUTSCHE WAFFEN-UND MUNITIONSFABRIKEN BERLIN
So what I can deduce is that this rifle was made in Berlin for the Argentine military in 1909. Simple as that.
Obviously it has been sporterized, comes with a Tasco scope (made in Japan), Weaver scope mounts and a padded leather sling with a bucks head, oak leaves and acorns.
Pretty nice set up.
I'm only asking $100 dollars because its missing the bolt but you can find one for like $50."

I love the rifle, the look, especially how it shoots. The problem is that I built it based on looks and performance and not what my needs are. This gun is way to nice to keep in the truck/tractor for varmints and I just can't stand to see it tore up. I would like to sell it to re-fund a new, more practical 10/22 project.

The gun shoots excellent, I myself have kept 10 shot groups under a quarter at 50 yards. In the hands of a friend/gunsmith that helped me build it, he was able to do 5 shot groups touching at 50 yards all day long. The rifle has about 200-300 rounds through it, has been well cared for and always kept dry and clean. I have around $1150 in the rifle to cover the entire project.

The stats are as follows:
--Whistlepig 20"" Fluted, High Polish Barrel
--Stocky's Stocks Thumbhole Anschutz Stock in Crimson
--Timney 2.5 lbs Target Trigger
--Polished 10/22 Target Bolt (Done by Heier's Custom)
--Polished 10/22 Receiver (Done by a member here)
--Tactical Innovations Charging Handle and Spring
--Tactical Innovations Picatinny Scope Base
--Weaver Scope Rings
--Nikon Prostaff 4-12x40 Scope
--1 Factory Magazine

Again the gun is super well cared for and has not been over shot by any stretch. This gun would make an excellent bench/target gun for beginner to pro alike. I am asking $850 OBO and I would be willing to meet or ship via USPS. I will ship with $200 over the selling price in insurance, buyer to pay actual shipping only.

Surefire sells these for $108; I have two for sale $70/each.  

Manufacturer description:

The MR11 attaches to all rail-less variations of the Beretta 92 pistol, including the government M9, and the Beretta 96, providing the rail necessary to mount any SureFire X Series WeaponLight. With the MR11 attached, the X Series WeaponLights can be easily slid off your pistol, carried separately, and slid on again when needed. 

The MR11 fits snugly and securely to the pistol. This lightweight, low-profile mount is slim enough to allow the pistol plus mount to fit most holsters made for the Beretta 92. May not fit custom-molded holsters. Made from very high strength 7000 series aluminum; many competition mounts are made out 6000 series, which has about half the strength. Design allows tightening or removal of the MR11 with a cartridge rim - no hex wrench necessary. Trigger guard locking wedge is energy absorbent polyurethane, avoiding metal-to-metal contact. A spacer shim is provided to accommodate manufacturing variations in the trigger guard thickness (e.g. the M9). Features an anti-chafing pad to prevent scoring of the dust cover."

My wife and I have roughly only 20-30 rounds through this gun, and it was purchased around March 2012. The firearm and all the things that came with it are included, and in totally mint condition.

The reason I want to trade is I shot just as good with the 3.8"" at the range as I did with our current gun, and recently made the decision to carry concealed. The 4.5"" XDM is very carry-able, I use a FoXx IWB holster, but it's just a hair to big for my comfort level. I've never traded/bought a firearm outside of a gun shop, so we'll have to figure out how to go through a FFL. Contact me if you're interested!

The white inlay on the gun is plain old crayola white, so it's easy to remove with mild soap and water.

I have the firearm listed for sale/trade on my car club website as well, my user name is spooky_pitboss, hence the nametag in the photos. That can be seen here :http://www.ls1gto.com/forums/showthread.php?t=454008

The receiver and trigger assembly has been polished for a smoother action and smoother trigger pull. All metal parts have been bathed in solvent and stripped of the nasty cosmoline and lubricated. Bore has been thoroughly cleaned with  the proper solvents to rid of the debris and lead left from the war and since it's cleaning I have not fired the Rifle. I do have more pictures if you want them.

Includes Redfield 6X scope and one factory magazine.  Will sell the rifle, scope and the used factory magazine for $600.

Factory magazines and the high capacity Colyer magazine are commanding high prices on gunsamerica, gunbroker and other sites.  I am not interested in selling the magazines by themselves unless someone purchases the rifle first without them.
