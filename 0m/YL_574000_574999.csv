This is an almost new Remington Versa Max with the 28"" barrel with the black synthetic stock. I've only shot four shells through it. It shows no signs of wear.

I bought it because I've been wanting a Benelli Cordoba, but then I saw that this shoots 3 1/2"" shells so I had to buy it. Though the action is very similar, I think i'm just partial to the Benelli.

It comes with the original case, paperwork, 5 chokes, gun lock, adjustable LOP's, Truglo interchangeable sporting clay front beads, etc.

Trades: Benelli M4. Nicer AR's, or even just lower receivers plus cash. I'd also consider a Beretta A400 Xplor, I like FN five-sevens, fnx-45 tacticals, HK guns, 1911's, over-under shotguns, auto-loading .410's, nicer rifles (especially .243 savages with accu-triggers), etc... I'll entertain all firearm offers. I can offer an assortment of rifles, shotguns, or pistols in the trade, or cash on either end to make the deal fair. For sale price is $1,000 cash OBO."

As a knife enthusiast, you may be ""in the know"" about Sanrenmu. For those of you who are not, let me explain. 

Sanrenmu Knives Co. LTD was founded back in December of 1998. This little known knife manufacturer is credited with making some very high quality, well designed yet affordable folder knives especially suited for every day carry purposes. In fact if you have any contacts within the knife/cutlery trade you will find out that Sanrenmu's other activities include manufacturing knives for numerous western brands such as Benchmande and Spyderco. So believe me when I say you're getting a lot for your money with Sanrenmu.

The knives sold under the Sanrenmu brand can go head to head with many other brands that cost two to three times more. That's what make these great EDC knives such an amazing find!

The GB-763 is one of Sanrenmu's more popular models. This G10 handled knife is very light, slim profiled and extremely durable. It has a hollow ground, drop point blade that is razor sharp. The Axis Lock system is very robust and the ambidextrous thumb studs and adjustable pocket clip (can be fitted to either side) make this little knife perfect whether your right handed or left handed.

If you're looking for a fantastic, high quality, every day pocket knife without the ridiculous price tag, look no further than Sanrenmu...you're ""in the know"" now.

Have a look at these specs:

- 2.5"" Blade (under 3"" and legal in most states)
- 3.5"" G10 Handle 
- 6.2"" Overall Length
- 2.1oz Weight
- Axis Lock
- Drop point Hollow Ground 8cr13Mov blade
- Ambidextrous Thumb Studs

 $ Discount $: If you have attended any of our other courses, we’ll take an additional ten dollars off the price of this course.

 The Personal Protection In the Home course teaches defensive / tactical shooting skills which cannot be taught on a typical ""box"" range. 

This intermediate level course enables experienced shooters to move to cover, shoot from behind barricades, develop and employ advanced Flash-Sight-Picture skills, and much more. 

We cover mindset, legal issues, decision-making under pressure, and planning for the worst. 

This course is designed around the use of the defensive pistol where standard marksmanship skills will not work, and will better enable you to survive a felonious attack.

 Topical areas include:

 1. Defensive Shooting / Rapid Engagement

 2. Defensive Handgun Skills

 3. Firearms and the Law: Possession, Ownership, and the Use of Deadly Force

 4. Strategies for Home Safety and Responding to a Violent Confrontation

 5. Selecting a Handgun for Personal Defense

 6. Three hours of Range Shooting

 7. Course Review and Examination

 Students will receive the NRA Guide to the Basics of Personal Protection in the Home handbook and intensive lessons on basics of defensive shooting, issues of self-defense, and other strategies for protecting the home and family.

 Students will receive feedback on their shooting exercises, and a National Rifle Association (NRA) certificate upon successful completion of this course. Not only are shooting standards fired during the practical exercises, but a written exam will be given at the end of the course. Throughout the course an individual checklist may be used to ensure the satisfactory absorption of the material being taught.

 Our next PPITH Course is scheduled for THIS SATURDAY, October 20th, 2012. Don't wait, sign up now!

Have ran about 100 rnds, probably needs about 100 more to be fully ""broken in"".  Normally shoot 7 1/2 or slugs.

Was previously selling with several upgrades, but converted back to stock in case folks were not interested in the upgrades it had.  I will have them available (2 twelve round surefire mags, tac-47 autoplug gas plug, ergo grip, k-var handguard) if you would like to purchase, otherwise I will sell separately.

Looking for $750 F to F, purchase permit preferred.  [size=12pt][b]Make offer![/b][/size]

1. Romanian M44 - first year of production in Romania. Production estimates for that year in Romania are no more than 5,000. Receiver and magazine floorplate were electropenciled to match. Very good condition. Low-numbered serial number prefix is AX. $200

2. Hungarian M44 - ALL MATCHING. Buttplate, receiver, barrel, floorplate and bolt. All parts, including the stock, have the correct ""02"" marking indicating Hungarian manufacture. It's very rare to have all parts match on Hungarian M44s. This rifle is also NOT import-marked anywhere on it that I can find. In really nice condition. $250

As a Madness Upper it means that they do not include a Bolt Carrier Group (BCG) or Charging Handle nor could you add those items to the upper at any reduced cost as with their Standard Uppers. I paid $315 shipped and that is what I am selling it for as it is unfired nor mounted on an ar-15 lower by me. PSA did test fire the upper for quality and function before they ship these.

It does not have a BCG or Charging Handle included at this price.
This it is the Upper Only without Charging Handle or Bolt Carrier Group for $315 firm. 

If you would like though I do have a new PSA Charging Handle that I bought seperately from PSA for this upper that was $21 shipped that I would sale for $15 if you are purchasing the upper too.

I also have a brand new unfired SI-Defense AR-15 BCG that I purchased for this Upper that I would sale for $120 if you are also buying the Upper & Charging Handle.

PSA BCGs are now $139.99 if you can ever find them instock and the last sale they had on them was non-PSA BCGs for Labor Day and they were $130 and non Magnetic Partical Inspected as the SI-Defense BCG is.
Currently from what I can tell you can't get a BCG from PSA even with the uppers that should have an option for one to be added at $130. They are completely out.

Below are the Specs of the Upper and BCG Should you be interested and the Charging Handle is the Forged 7075 Aluminum Mil-Spec Charging Handle.

Upper Specs 
Barrel:
Chrome moly vanadium barrel, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a Mid-length gas system. The special lighter weight profile barrel is chrome-lined, Magnetic particle inspected, phosphate coated to mil-specs, and finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, mid length-hand guards with heat shields, and an A2 flash hider.


Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Upper has M4 feedramps and is engraved ""M4"" above the gas tube hole, it features machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish.

Charging Handle $15 if purchased with upper.


BCG Specs $120 if purchased with upper & charging handle.

SI Defense AR-15 Semi-Auto bolt carrier group 100% mil-spec. The carrier body is machined from 8620 steel, heat treated, MP inspected and then Mil-DTL-16232G manganese phosphated. The carrier's bore is hard chromed for increased corrosion resistance and reliability. The bolt is machined from Carpenter 158 steel, shot peened, MP inspected and manganese phosphated per Mil-DTL-16232G. SI Defense Bolt Carrier Groups feature a gas key tube that is hard chromed and properly torqued and staked. The SI Defense Bolt Carrier Assembly is tough as they come.

Note: I am breaking it down this way because of a Troll on Armslist who thinks PSA is selling Complete Uppers WITH BCGs and Charging handles for this price.

Has sports wheels factory, all tires very good, near full tread.
Here is the history of this vehicle....This was a one owner, part of an estate
which I purchased about 5 years ago....Thus I am the second owner....I had plans
to upgrade somethings on this vehicle and make it my toy/fun vehicle...and
got side-tracked on another project...I purchased a 1930 Model A Rat Rod...

has mileage statement from the consignment dealer of the estate I purchased.

This Pick up has been adult owned....still bone stock, except for the upgrade
of the stereo....this truck has never towed anything....had never had a ball on the
chrome step bumper.....

Maintenance wise, I have started this vehicle about once a month and driven around 
my house, and then garaged again....thus, all seals are good, no leaks.
This is an new, older vehicle, never owned by a kid and or young adult,
thus, speculate never hot rodded/abused.

In vehicle, for part of the money on this:
(small car example: Kia Spectra 5 speed manual
Trans). No automatics in small cars please. 
I have many more photos of this vehicle I
Can forward by email, and will answer any questions.
This vehicle runs good, and sounds great, and is a real
Head turner when going down the road.... I get lots
Of waves and honks. You can drive this one home.
Contact Bob, 580-791-261one........my cell

I will also consider High End Hunting items 
tactical guns, military, and any combination of

as partial trade...also consider another decent vehicle and or
small bumper hitch pull travel trailer as partial not over 30'
also like air cooled Volkswagen, old school bug
Custom General Motors full size van also considered
(no FORD products, I have never had good luck with them)
Jeep products with 6 cylinder inline
I am open to offers
I am not looking for even trade for another vehicle
also do the math....do not offer me $5,000 worth of stuff
thinking I will trade......

  This is a large majority of my firearms collection. I have decided to consolidate after realizing that I am only one man and can only shoot one gun at a time. To the same respect, I'm looking to shoot more often on fewer platforms. Restricting myself to only higher quality, higher end pieces. If I diminish my collection from many to few, I want those few to be the very best out there at what they do. I like to think of myself as a VERY diverse shooter. I enjoy the sport of shooting and am open to many different venues, situations, and purposes: Home Defense, Competition, Target, Etc. With that being said...My goal is to trade up, not to sell. I have no problem offering multiple firearms in exchange for one, as long as the VALUE and QUALITY is there. Every firearm I own is in excellent condition or brand new. Nothing on this list is below 95%+ condition and most are way above (unless noted). The prices listed next to each piece are fair middle ground prices. I could start high with the expectation to be bartered with, but why not skip all the BS and cut to the chase. Please do not contact me expecting to be able to pay the lowest price listed, as again, I'm not really looking to sell. I understand that due to location and demographic, the values I have listed may be lower or higher then what is available in your area. I would like to think I am a reasonable person. If you believe I'm too low or too high please let me know and depending on what you're offering we may be able to work something out. I'm not in any hurry to get rid of any piece so please no low ball offers. I'm looking for straight value for value here. If you believe your offer to have higher than expected value, please explain why. That is why I'm here, to get the best of the best.

 What I'm looking for:

 1911's (for carry, competition, HD, etc)... Brands I'm interested in: Wilson Combat, Nighthawk Custom, Les Baer, Ed Brown, Colt, Dan Wesson. 

 AR-15 Platform (anything from LD, to target, to tactical)... Brands I'm interested in: Noveske, POF, Les Baer, Colt, Sabre, BCM, LMT

 I am an experienced shooter, but I'm far from an expert. I ALWAYS love learning about new firearms and platforms. If you have a firearm that isn't listed above, but think it meets the expectations of what I'm looking for, then please tell me about it and I would be happy to do some research.

This is the perfect Sniper/long range system. It is designed for percision with its completely adjustable stock, fully free floated threaded and fluted barrel, crips trigger, and straight pull bolt. The is the ulitimate way to go for long range shooting. 

I'm looking to do a high end 1911/AR-15 Trade or sell for cash. I had big dreams for this rifle system. However, the cost for ammo/optic was just going to be too high for what this rifle deserves. It has had less then 20 down the pipe. Below is some info about the Blaser Tactical 2:

The Tactical 2 is the most advanced version of the precision rifle developed by Blaser.
Each design element was driven by the requirement to create the best shooting platform
possible. Exceptional accuracy was one of the key principles during development, with
effective engagement ranges of 1500 meters or more, depending on caliber and
ammunition. Advanced engineering and uncompromising quality are evident in every facet
of design. The Tactical 2 is a bolt action rifle featuring Blaser’s revolutionary straight-pull
action. When the bolt is closed, the 360 degree radial collet expands into the locking
groove in the barrel – the bolt head is auto-centering and self-headspacing. The straight
pull action features no rotating parts and assures rapid reloading with minimum
movement. The rifle can easily be converted for left or right hand shooters. Interchange
calibers by replacing the barrel and bolt head, in under a minute, without special tools
and no change in accuracy. Barrels are cold hammer forged, fluted and plasma-nitrided to
provide maximum resistance against corrosion and abrasion. An M1913 Picatinny rail is
fixed to the barrel, ensuring full compatibility with a wide range of optical sighting
systems. The muzzle end is threaded for an optional muzzle brake. The receiver is
machined from aircraft grade billet aluminum alloy and is the interface for the barrel, bolt
assembly, trigger assembly and magazine. A recoil lug of hardened steel is integrated
into the receiver. The entire unit is fixed to the stock, eliminating temperature induced
distortion. The outer surface is hard anodized. The ergonomically correct stock is injection
molded out of fiber reinforced polymers and is absolutely stable, even under extreme
temperatures.

Special 10th Anniversary Edition of a Limited Edition gun

The Remington 700 Milspec 5R rifle was first introduced as a limited edition rifle around 2003, and ever since then it has been of keen interest to many shooters. The ability to have a rifle with the same barrel as the M24 SWS used by the US Army Snipers, but at a fraction of the $6000 price tag of the M24 is a big drawing point. While the milspec is not a standard item in the Remington catalog, it is still made when possible. 

The barrels are a unique 1:11.2"" twist, as found on the M24.  This faster twist rate helps stabilize heavy bullets better.

 It also has the 5R rifling which is also unique to the M24.  5R rifling uses 5 lands and 5 grooves instead of the traditional 6 lands and grooves. In addition, the sides of each land are cut at a 65 degree angle versus a harsh 90 degree angle on standard rifling.

Benefits of 5R: 5R rifling’s unique design provides benefits to the shooter by causing less bullet deformation. How? Because the edges of each land do not cut into and deform the bullet jacket. When the bullet jacket is less deformed, there will be less jacket fouling in the grooves. The results are better consistency of accuracy from shot to shot, greater bullet stability over multiple shots, and ultimately a rifle that’s easier to clean thoroughly.  

The barrel is 24"" in length which is also different than the normal Remington 26"" barrels.  The M24 barrels are stainless and as such so are these barrels.  The barrels have the standard Remington 11 degree tapered target crown.  

This is also a special 10th Anniversary Edition of the Limited Edition gun to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the ARMY’S M24 and the 5R rifling. 

This gun is a sub-MOA gun!!!
