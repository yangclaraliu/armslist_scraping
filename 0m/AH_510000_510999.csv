Now to be fair, the BW80 does need a new carburetor and should have a new float. It's just that I have heard that the BW80's are collectable and also I don't really have a need or time for it and thought someone out there might appreciate it or at least use it more. The carburetor is about a $30 fix it you are a Do-it-yourselfer.

Yes, you can play it sitting down. Place the ""V"", INTO your leg and not ON your leg, then support the body with your other leg.
Nosedives? Yes but not bad.

The only bad thing about the guitar is there is no case and there is an abundance of very fine scratches on the back of the body from the previous owner which do not penetrate the gloss coat but the rest of the guitar is in VERY good looking condition with no actual dings anywhere.

MSRP (from Memory was over $1000.00)
Actual selling price new was around $800.00
Due to the current market being over saturated with Schecter Hellraiser guitars, the
ASKING PRICE IS ONLY $400.00 which is a lot lower than it should be for this incredible guitar.

The current market price doesn't accurately reflect just how good of a guitar this is.
So, this is just a word of caution for those of you who don't know how to haggle, when to haggle and when not to haggle or don't know a good deal when you see one.
$600.00 would be a completely fair asking price for such a high quality guitar! But I understand the concept of supply and demand and that is why the low asking price.

Will consider offers of trade. There are some very specific items that I am looking for such as...
a handgun (9mm, .45, .357), AR15 complete upper, a small but professional quality 3 or 4 piece drum set. (DW or Pacific) or a G&L 4 string bass guitar or maybe a 50 watt (or greater) combo amp.

Not willing to ship or travel any great distance to meet you. Face to face transactions only. Include a phone number upon your first contact and compose a proper inquiry so that I don't misidentify you as a scammer. You can try the guitar with a small portable battery powered amp that I have which you use to play through headphones."

So, this is just a word of caution for those of you who don't know how to haggle, when to haggle and when not to haggle or don't know a good deal when you see one.
$600.00 would be a completely fair asking price for such a high quality guitar! But I understand the concept of supply and demand and that is why the low asking price.

Not willing to ship or travel any great distance to meet you. Face to face transactions only. Include a phone number upon your first contact and compose a proper inquiry so that I don't misidentify you as a scammer. You can try the guitar with a small portable battery powered amp that I have which you use to play through headphones."

This AR shoots tight groups and has never had any malfunctions. Also installed is a adjustable stock. The best part about this rifle is that it weighs just over 5 pounds unloaded. If you are looking for an awesome AR-15 carbine that doesn't break your back every time you try to pick it up, then this is the rifle for you. I will consider trades but cash is king.

Attached is a photo proving that this is steel core. The black tar-like substance located at the bottom of the bullet proves it. The ammo is individually boxed in original twenty round boxes. The boxes themselves are collectible. You will be hard pressed to find this ammo for this price. I have physically cut open one round and pulled the bullet out of the casing to prove that it is steel core. Do your research and see what this ammo sells for.

It has a very nice smooth, crisp trigger that is adjustable. Very nice shooter and I can only imagine the number of squirrels it's bagged over the last 50-70 years. The only issue is the 5rd mag. It's some part that helps it get removed from the gun, one guy told me there was probably a small knob on the base used to pull the mag from the gun but I can't confirm that. I've been leaving the mag in and shooting it as a single, shot and I'm sure that a person with more mechanical knowledge than I have can fix it. There is also 1 screw missing near the mag on the bottom, two other screws attach the frame to the stock so its doesn't cause any problems, I just want to make you aware that it's missing.

My price is $120 because it's a very nice shooting old gun that is fully functional. Located in Indy and not looking to travel much for a sale."

$ Discount $:  If you have attended any of our other courses, we’ll take an additional ten dollars off the price of this course.

    The Personal Protection In the Home course teaches defensive / tactical shooting skills which cannot be taught on a typical ""box"" range.  

    This intermediate level course enables experienced shooters to move to cover, shoot from behind barricades, develop and employ advanced Flash-Sight-Picture skills, and much more.  

   We cover mindset, legal issues, decision-making under pressure, and planning for the worst. 

   This course is designed around the use of the defensive pistol where standard marksmanship skills will not work, and will better enable you to survive a felonious attack.

Topical areas include:

1. Defensive Shooting / Rapid Engagement

2. Defensive Handgun Skills

3. Firearms and the Law: Possession, Ownership, and the Use of Deadly Force

4. Strategies for Home Safety and Responding to a Violent Confrontation

5. Selecting a Handgun for Personal Defense

6. Three hours of Range Shooting

7. Course Review and Examination

   Students will receive the NRA Guide to the Basics of Personal Protection in the Home handbook and intensive lessons on basics of defensive shooting, issues of self-defense, and other strategies for protecting the home and family.

   Students will receive feedback on their shooting exercises, and a National Rifle Association (NRA) certificate upon successful completion of this course. Not only are shooting standards fired during the practical exercises, but a written exam will be given at the end of the course. Throughout the course an individual checklist may be used to ensure the satisfactory absorption of the material being taught.

The part number ""PI9CUS"" refers to a special build 1911-A1, usually an exclusive for one of our distributors. These special builds are factory pistols which have additional features added to give the distributor something different to offer their customers which the other distributors do not have. They are usually built in set quantities and for a limited time period.

What do you have to trade? I'm looking for handguns (have PTC), or a high-end Tmobile phone. A Galaxy S3 + cash, 3rd Gen iPad, DSLR, Canon 10-22 lens, or? No long guns unless it's worth more than the Springer and I can sell it.

This revolver is available the week of August 11, 2012. I'm visiting Huntsville for the HAM radio show.

This is one of two revolvers my dad acquired from his military police, security guard type friends years ago and passed along to me. I don't need two of them.

I have fired this revolver, about 100 rounds over a 10 year period, and I have had the local gunsmith look it over. The 38 is in excellent condition and like many revolvers unless kept in a box shows a bit of holster wear.

I am the original owner of this CMP M-1 Garand HRA Grade and purchased it new in April 2012. After I got home I decided that the rifle is too heavy for my use and I am not a gun collector, so I have decided to sell it. I have not additionally cleaned the rifle or fired it since purchase. The benefit to you is that one of the gunsmiths spent about 45 minutes to help me select the best one we could from the 100's on the rack. So the wood matches and the metal is in excellent condition. If you order online or by mail or phone, you get the next one off the rack. So I'm asking what I paid for it ($625.00) and I'll split the tax ($62.50) and include sling.

Those who know AK's know that Norinco makes some of the very finest on the market. This one is chambered in 7.62x39, built on a stamped receiver, has laminated wood furniture, a tapco slant muzzle brake, and has been converted to the originally intended AKM format with a traditional pistol grip. This weapon is the very definition of reliability and has functioned flawlessly every time it was taken to the range. Even though this is an AK platform rifle, it has been maintained as meticulously as any AR could hope to be.

Also included is 300 rounds of steel cased ammo (which has always shot like a dream in the firearm) and two steel 30 round magazines."

The 455 is the upgrade to the 452, a simple barrel change and you can shoot 22lr, 22mag and 17 HMR. These are some of the most accurate out of the Box rim-fire rifles you can get.

Now you'll be lucky to find a WASR under $500 unless someone grinded the finish off to make it look like Call of Duty. I bought it for $600 at the gunshow in Jacksonville. Since then, I put 20 rounds through it and put all Tapco Furniture on it. I just really want an underfolder right now so I'm looking to sell it. Price with all Tapco furniture and a magpro 30 round mag is $6o0 FIRM. The only thing I would trade for is an underfolder AK, a polish underfolder would be fantastic but manufacturer is not important. The only other way I would part with this AK is for an HK pistol like a USP .45 compact (my favorite) or a P2000. Don't care how used it is but if it's new and you want cash to boot, look elsewhere. I won't ask for cash if someone is willing to trade me an underfolder in similar condition to my AK even if it's an old WASR. Just has to function right and all the parts (like the mag well) need to fit decent like mine. I also have an ad up just for AK furniture."
