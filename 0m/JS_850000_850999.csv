Back in the heyday of the TV Western, Steve McQueen, the star of ""Wanted: Dead or Alive,"" rode across black-and-white screens toting a sidearm like nothing any lawman or outlaw had carried before. A cut-down, modified version of repeating rifle, this recognizable shootin’ iron could be holstered like a pistol but fired with the speed of lever-action rifle. Nicknamed the Mare’s Leg, this innovative weapon swiftly brought outlaws to justice every week and rose to fame as the real star of the short-lived show. Now fans of those classic Westerns and collectors of innovative firearms can holster a replica of that famous made-for-TV sidearm.
Built in the USA, to Henry’s world-renowned standards of quality, the Mare’s Leg is available in your choice of .45 COLT or in .22 S/L/LR

The Henry Mare’s Leg .45 Colt is a modified variation of the Henry model H006C Big Boy .45 Colt. The Henry Mare’s Leg .22 S/L/LR a modified variation of the model H001 Henry Lever Action.

Like all Henry Rifles, each sports a select, handcrafted American Walnut stock cut to the exact specification of the gun used on the television series. The large loop lever, coupled with the legendary crisp Henry action, makes it easy for you to enjoy those rapid-fire repeating shots Steve McQueen used to take down the bad guys.

Each is equipped with a saddle ring.

Both calibers are equipped with an easy-loading tubular magazine design."

All electronics work. New tires. Have tons of spares and stock parts. Also have new grips and case savers that are not installed. Painted valve cover caps, head light bezel, headers and slip ons, and rear fender flat black (sand blasted, primed and painted, headers and slip ons were painted with high temp exhaust paint). Oil and filter are new. 

It is rideable and a test ride is possible with CASH IN HAND.

Needs: blinkers, tail light, battery, front fender finished. 

Comes With: Grips, case savers, 2 more oil filters, all the stock stuff I removed (rear fender, old brake lines, blinkers, tail light, etc, etc.)

My plans were to put a cafe racer style tail light on and that would pretty much be it. I was going to redo the front fender (it is cut already but needs finishing), but thought it looked better without it on so I didnt finish it. I also was not going to install blinkers (not illegal, just use hand signals) because I thought it would clutter the look up. It is wired for blinkers though. I can do the tail light and a new battery for interested parties, but we will have to work that out.

I think there are currently 13 rounds of the FMJ and 45 rounds of the JHP'S that are reloads that I got at the gun show and look to me like golden saber bullets.  They all shoot fine and the gun hasn't jammed for me yet.  It is REALLY accurate for a small gun too.  I was amazed.  I did a little research on this gun and its a precursor to the Keltec .380 and was actually designed by one of the originators of keltec.  $275.  Might consider trades for .223, 9mm, .40cal, or .22LR ammo."

If you don't know the law or you have been given INCORRECT advice then you need to visit this forum and speak with us and search the threads!

I've heard many people say that ""you cannot carry a firearm loaded in your vehicle"" or that ""you cannot carry one openly on your person unless you have a KY CDWL.""  This is COMPLETELY FALSE!  

You only need a CDWL in KY to CONCEAL a deadly weapon, but you can also carry concealed without a license in certain places (KRS 527.020).

Kentucky firearm laws can be found here:
http://lrc.ky.gov/KRS/237-00/CHAPTER.HTM
and
http://lrc.ky.gov/KRS/527-00/CHAPTER.HTM

There is also a statute here:
http://lrc.ky.gov/KRS/244-00/125.PDF

The Court of Justice can prohibit firearms in their facilities under authority of this statute:
http://lrc.ky.gov/KRS/447-00/154.PDF

OPENLY carried firearms are NOT prohibited in all of the places where CONCEALED firearms are prohibited because the right to OPENLY carry a firearm and other deadly weapons is protected by the KY Constitution with KY Supreme Court precedent:
http://www.kc3.com/Holland%20v%20Commonwealth.htm

Kentucky has STRONG firearm preemption and NO ONE in the state can regulate firearms, ammunition or components except the General Assembly: 
http://lrc.ky.gov/KRS/065-00/870.PDF

Places where openly carried firearms are prohibited:

K-12 schools unless exempted under KRS 527.020: http://lrc.ky.gov/KRS/527-00/070.PDF

Court of Justice facilities (this is circuit court, district court and circuit clerk facilities; also KY appeals and SC facilities).  This is NOT a county courthouse with public offices.

Detention Facilities under authority of KRS 520.050: http://lrc.ky.gov/KRS/520-00/050.PDF

Cannot carry concealed in a BAR; can carry openly as long as the firearm is unloaded under KRS 244.125; most resteraunts are exempted from this so read the statute.

Very low hour count, less than 10 hours, as evidence this unit is still running it's factory supplied batteries.  Included is an extra set of batteries (CR123A's) which can be purchased almost anywhere.  Mounts using any Picatinny rail.  

This is a remarkable Generation 2+, fixed 5x optic that is usable both in day and night.  This riflescope features all the factory tools & accessories including an ATN 450mw Infrared Illuminator and fitted SKB hardcase.  Also includes instruction manual and ATN catalog.  

I purchased this Crusader new, mounted it on an AR15, sighted it in, shot a hog with it, then put it in the safe. Apart from a NIB unit, you will not find another one with a lower hour count.   I have really enjoyed taking this hunting but other financial needs have persuaded me to sell. I'd be happy to discuss with anyone the practical ranges and ideal weather conditions when using this scope.

Make a reasonable offer and I will respond. Also let me know if you are able to do a FTF transfer within an hour or so of Asheville, NC.

In your reply, please answer these questions which will determine what I'm willing to sell for:
1. Are you over 21 years old. If not don't contact me.

2. Can you do a FTF transfer????

3. Do you have an North Carolina concealed carry permit????

4. Are you interested buying my .45 ammo with the gun?????"

This faux ""silencer"" has standard AR-15/M4 threads and threads over your barrel in front and covers the barrel backward towards the sight block. This is not a barrel extension and does not add any length to your barrel, it slips over your existing barrel hiding the last 5 inches or so, giving your weapon the illusion of being a short barreled rifle with a supressor installed. California already bans barrel shrouds, which is what this is classified as, so if Feinstein gets her way this will be illegal under any new Federal ""assault weapons"" ban.

Willing to split these sets up if you only need one or the other: $350/ea for the receivers, $150/ea for the parts kits.

Would prefer to deal locally: I would be willing to meet you at your FFL at or a gunshop of your choice in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Willing to work something out if you don't live in the area but please keep in mind that I don't have a Paypal account.

$500 for the lower+parts kit is firm. Demand for these is very high right now and if you don't think this is a good deal, I'd recommend taking a look at what other people want for these receivers and parts kits seperately or preassembled.

Not terribly excited about trades but willing to consider. I like Glocks, Walther P99s/PPS, Sig P220/P226s, most modern H&K pistols, Springfield 1911s, Mossberg 930SPX and 590 shotguns, Ruger GP100s and S&W .357 revolvers, CZ rifles/pistols/shotguns, and Ruger Mini-14/Mini-30s.

    I have a DPMS panther AR-15 for sale. I bought it new about a year ago and used it approx once a month giving it a cleaning after each use.  I know I shot it exactly 980 times as I bought a 1,000 round box of brass with it and used them all but one box (that box comes with the gun).  I may add, I bought that thousand rounds of brass for $275.  Now, as you know, ammo prices are through the roof.  I can't afford to shoot it anymore.  It was nice while it lasted, but I guess it is time to part with it as I don't see ammo prices coming down.
    I replaced the front iron sight with a low profile picatiny rail block ($40).  One of the first upgrades I did was put on a nice aluminum quad picatiny rail ($80).  2 mags, both 30 rounders, and my last 20 rounds of PMC brass, and the case all come with it.  I'm selling it for $1700.  Lowballs will be ignored, and if I don't get a good cash offer or nice trade then it will be at the Niles OH gun show in 12 days and will take the best cash offer that comes along there.
    I'm not willing to ship it, nor travel far. If you can't meet me in a public area like a Giant Eagle or Walmart in Mahoning County (Youngstown/Boardman/Austintown/Canfield), then you can't buy it."

Below is an excerpt from a book written by the descendants of Andy Adkins-WW2 veteran and 317th member.  The above bayonet was one that was used by this group and the role that they played in liberating Europe during the D-Day post invasion fighting.  This is a truly historic bayonet and is a talking peice in and of itself.  This will really compliment your carbine.  

You Can’t Get Much Closer Than This  <>  Combat with Company H, 317th Infantry Regiment, 80th Division <> New Condition <>  258 pages, illustrated, index, bibliography, notes - When the 80th Infantry Division completed its training in December 1943, it was shipped in stages to the United Kingdom and then on to Normandy, where it landed on August 3, 1944. There, Lieutenant Adkins and his fellow soldiers took part in light hedgerow fighting that served to shake the division down and familiarize the troops and their officers with combat. The first real test came on August 20, 1944, when the 2d Battalion, 317th Infantry, attacked high ground near Argentan during the Allied drive to seal huge German forces in the Falaise Pocket. While scouting for mortar positions in the woods, Andy Adkins ran into a group of Germans and shot one of them dead with his carbine. This baptism in blood taught him the answer to a question every novice combatant wants to hear: He was cool under fire, capable of killing when facing the enemy. He later wrote, ""It was a sickening sight, but having been caught up in the heat of battle, I didn't have a reaction other than feeling I had saved my own life."" Thereafter, the 2nd Battalion, 317th Infantry, took part in a succession of bloody battles across France. Ineptly led through the tenures of several battalion commanders, the unit suffered grievous losses even as it took hills and towns away from brave and well-led German army veterans. In the course of fighting graphically portrayed in this soldier's memoir, Andy Adkins acted with remarkable skill and courage, placing himself at the forefront of the action whenever he could. His extremely aggressive delivery of critical supplies to a cutoff unit in an embattled French town earned him a Bronze Star Medal"

The original Winchester Model 1873 rifles, ""the rifle that won the west"", with longer than standard barrel lengths are very rare and are highly sought after by collectors. There were more than 700,000 Model 1873 rifles produced. Approximately 600 were made with barrels longer than standard, making this a very rare firearm. Of these 600 longer barreled models, only a hand full had 30"" barrels. Uberti believes that the 30"" model is by far the most handsome of the Model 1873's.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately. The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations. Nightmare, features a black hard coat anodized frame and Nitron coated slide, black G-10 grips and nickel accents.

It comes with all of the factory paperwork, original case and a magazine. I did upgrade the stock to a Magpul Rifle MOE stock a couple of weeks ago. I can give you the original stock if you would like. I also have a stripped factory DPMS upper with forward assist and dust cover that I can add if you want to switch out the upper assembly. These are sold out everywhere and are getting harder and harder to find. Better get this one before Obama uses his Executive Order. If you have any questions please ask. Once again this is a FACTORY NEW RIFLE. Asking 2999 or best offer. Any reasonable offer will be considered. I will add the stripped upper receiver for asking price."
