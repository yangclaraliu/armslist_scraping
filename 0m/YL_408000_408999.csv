The accu-trigger is awesome and has pretty much spoiled me on rifle triggers. In great condition, she's been babied since I got her a few years back from another forum member. No wear to the bluing or wood. Anything that looks like an imperfection in the photos is either dust or oil. Tasco 3-9x40 scope + Weaver mounts. Four magazines are included with the rifle.

The only reason I'm selling is that I've gone semi-auto with a 10/22. 

Asking $225 for the rifle, scope + four mags. Located in Garner/Raleigh. A valid NC drivers license + bill of sale required. Open to trades, but I'm not looking for anything in particular at the moment, so let me know what you're offering.

So, I bought both with the intent of keeping one and selling the other. I ended up going with a stainless version so this one is up for grabs.

For sale is a Lipsey's exclusive Ruger 10/22, blued finish with a gorgeous walnut mannlicher stock featuring beautiful basketweave grip and forearm checkering, plus a nice cheek rest. This gun is brand new, never fired, still has all paperwork, lock and original box and manual. This is a hard-to-find model; I had to have it shipped because I couldn't find a dealer locally that had one in stock or could get it from their distributors.

I have $375 in this and that's what I'm looking to get out of it. No more, no less. No trades unless they are heavily weighted in my favor, as I'm solely looking to recoup the expense. Located in Garner/Raleigh. A valid NC drivers license + bill of sale required.

THE CONDITION IS EXCELLENT 
Caliber 7,62x39 mm
Length of Barrel: 21""

In mid-1950s Soviet army started trials for a new infantry weapons system to replace the 7.62x39 SKScarbines, AKassault rifles and RPD LMGs.Several designers submitted their designs, which included both assault rifle and machine rifle / LMG – basically the same weapon as the companion rifle but with a longer, heavier barrel and with larger capacity, but still compatible, magazines. In 1961, Soviet army has chosen the Kalashnikov system, comprising of a modified AKM assault rifle and RPK squad automatic weapon (machine rifle / light machine gun). RPK stands for Ruchnoy Pulemjot Kalashnikova- Kalashnikov hand-held (light) machine gun. Copies of the RPK are produced in several countries, that also made AK type rifles.

The RPK is a gas operated, magazine fed, air cooled, selective fire weapon.The basic action, with a long-stroke gas piston located above the barrel and a rotating bolt, is similar to that of the Kalashnikov assault rifle. The trigger unit and safety is also the same,therefore the RPK fires from a closed bolt in both semi-automatic and automatic modes. The barrel is permanently fixed to the receiver and cannot be replaced in the field.
Ammunition feed is from magazines only.The magazine interface is same as on the Kalashnikov assault rifle in the same caliber, and RPK and AKM magazines are interchangeable. However, the standard magazines for RPK are of extended capacity. The most common are curved box magazines holding 40 rounds of ammunition. 

Standard sights of RPK are basically similar to that of the AKM rifle, with hooded post front and tangent type rear sight, marked for ranges between 100 and 1000 meters. However, the RPK rear sight also includes a windage adjustment mechanism. 

RPK machine guns are fitted with integral folding bipods made from steel stampings."

All of them are used and have been fired. I'm looking for some idiot to give me more than what they can buy the same weapon for at a retail store. 

To 90% of the posters on here - If you didn't receive the firearm directly from the manufacturer, or a legitimate distributor, it is not new, regardless if you've fired it or not. This alone drops the value 10% below market price.

To everyone else - your firearm is not worth new retail price, or more. I can't even count the number of used firearms on here people are asking ridiculous money for. Theres $400-500 SKS's, (which are a $200-$300 gun tops at major retailers), TCP's and Sigma's for $300+ used. (which are $250-$280 NEW), glocks, sigs, kel-tecs, rugers are the same story, and don't get me started on shotguns. Mossbergs are $300 max new, provided they come with 2 barrells, and I've seen plenty wanting more than that for a single barrell.

Bottom line is this - Unless you are trying to sell to inelligible owners, no buyer with half a brain, and legitimate money, is going to pay you a premium over the NEW price, period. If you overpaid, that's your problem. Don't bother advertising your used piece for $20-$100 over what you can buy a new one for. It's basic economics, sure right now the market is on the fritz, but it's an election year, it doesn't make your $200 gun worth $500, sorry!! 

If you want to sell a firearm quickly to a legal and eligible buyer, a good starting price is 3/4's of current retail, NOT 150-200% more. QUIT ASKING MORE THAN MSRP FOR YOUR USED FIREARM, SOMEONE MAY ACTUALLY BUY IT FOR MARKET PRICE!!

I'm not selling, but I'll throw some guns and prices out there *quality pieces*, comparable to what I've scene on here: Russian Mosin/Nagain M91/54 with al accessories, Tula manufacture, Round Reciever, - $350; Hungarian and Chek Makarov's - $500 each; 1895 Nagant revolver, with holster, and cleaning rod, Tula - $350; Taurus TCP 380 with 2 mags and 2 holsters - $400; Hi-Points .45 acp and 9mm carbine with a tactical stock and extended mag - $750; Jimenez .380 and 9mm - $450; RG 22LR -$200; Winchester 870 Wingmaster 12 ga. - $750; Savage 22LR rifle with scope - $375.

Honestly, I wouldn't meet someone in person, or sell any of those firearms at these prices. That deal would have bad news written all over it, and from the scammers I've seen on here, I wouldn't risk my life to sell a firearm I have no desire to get rid of..."

I am trying to get funds together for a big bore revolver.

This is a very clean and lightly used gun.  It shows a small amount of holster wear on the slide release and standard wear on the hood of the barrel, but other than that, it looks almost new.  It comes with two backstraps.  The medium and the large.  Also comes with a flat bottom mag, finger extension mag, and the x-grip extender with a full length mag.

Only trades I will entertain are 44mag or larger revolvers.  I would be adding cash of course.

You are looking at an FS2000 which has had less than 350 rounds fired through it and is in MINT CONDITION! The gun was purchased on 1/03/12. There is nothing wrong with this gun, no surprises! I am selling this beauty because I recently purchased a Franck Muller, and as a result I must part with this gun. 

This rifle has numerous extras which include: 
-Judo chop's custom charging handle which is practically unbreakable (unlike the stock FS200 handle) and offers better grip ($50 if you can find one)

-Installed Neu-trigger which reduces trigger pull and helps eliminate the ""mushy"" trigger which most bullpups have (can be easily removed if desired) ($30 new)

-2  30 round Preban mags.... and yes, they are actually real pre-ban and stamped. ($150 value)


-Elite Survival Systems Discreet Case in Excellent condition, fits the FS 2000 like a condom. ($120 New)

All items which came with the gun are included such as the instruction manual, cleaning kit and gun lock. As a bonus I will include 240 rounds of 62 grain .223 on stripper clips. I have been on Ebay for over 8 years and I have numerous Ebay references who can vouch for me upon request. Please feel free to ask me any questions. Additional pictures available upon request.

Asking $2000.  Go to your local dealer and ask them what is the best deal they can give you on this gun new, it won't be less than $2100 and of course it won't have the $400 of accessories included above.   

Thanks,

#1 This is an exceptional piece. It is from 1918, part of a large shipment of 347000 guns from colt in late 1918 (starting in october from serial number) The pistol has the Black Army Finish. I would rate the blue at 95-98 percent with some scratches that are evident in the pictures, but barely any wear. Checkered walnut grips, there is a small crack on the left side grip from the top grip screw up, appears to be stable once again please see pictures. It has a two tone lanyard base magazine. The late war eagle head with a S5 underneath is stamped on the left side of frame as well a 7 on the trigger guard. The left side of slide is stamped with colts 2 blocks of patents and address. The rampant colt is stamped behind the slide serrations and is missing the front hooves (see pictures) The right side of the slide is marked ""model of 1911 U.S.Army. The right side of the frame is marked with serial number and United States Property. No. 538**4. There are some insignificant scratches on the right side (see pictures) They are minor at best. The barrel has a P proof stamped horizontally to the bore and is it's only mark, rifling is sharp and grooves are shiny excellent + bore. The 'H' provisional stamp of Frank Hosmer is stamped above the rear firing pin stop. The pistol has the long checkered hammer that was adopted in 1914. Overall this is a VERY VERY nice WW1 and I would rate it a NRA excellent especially for a gun that is over 90 years old. $2000+ shipping. Please make sure your FFL will accept from a Non-FFL or an extra $30 fee will apply.

Checkered diamond colt walnut grips that are worn in places feels good in hand no major chips, cracks or gouges, there is a compression mark on the right grip across the top diamond. It has a two tone lanyard base magazine. The left side of the frame has the eagle head acceptance mark. The right side is marked with the serial number "" "" and""united states property"". The left side of slide is stamped with colts 2 blocks of patents and address. The rampant colt is stamped between the blocks. The right side of the slide is marked ""model of 1911 U.S.Army. There is are some scratches under the slide release and some freckling on the slide release lever as well. The barrel has a P proof stamped on the connector link housing and .45 colt auto stamped horizontally to the bore in the outside chamber area. The blueing on barrel is food and would rate at 80+. Rifling is sharp and grooves are shiny excellent + bore. The pistol has the long checkered hammer that was adopted in 1914. Overall this is a nice WW1 and I would rate it a NRA fine especially for a gun that is over 90 years old. $1500+ shipping. Please make sure your FFL will accept from a Non-FFL or an extra $30 fee will apply.

It has an unknown brand 3 prong style flash hider as well. If you want, it'll come with an old tasco 4x32 on quick dismount rings that I had sitting around, but show obvious wear, but the scope is still completely functional. 2 factory 7 round mags and 1 aftermarket 11 or 12 rounder. I was told by the previous owner it had less than 500 rounds through, and I've only personally put about 30 or so through it with no problems function wise, but the factory wood stock cracked, hence the new choate. the cracked stock and original buffer and spring are yours if you want them for whatever reason. These things are a blast to shoot and an awesome plinker for those who want a bit more pop than a 22.

We know what actual Lapua branded brass costs($250 per 100) But it's a must for a .338 Lapua in my opinion. I've wrestled with selling the scope or keeping it. It truely is a unbelievable optic and goes perfect with the Lapua rifle. I'm selling this as a package so you will be ready to go from the get go. If interested contact me and we can talk more. A lot of the times text message is the easiest way to get a hold of me. With a 2 week old son and a almost 3 year old son, makes it tough. But email, text, or phone is fine. If I don't answer, please leave me a voicemail. I have my FFL and would rather sell or trade it for a firearm or firearms from another FFL holder. But I will sell to anyone who is eligible and provides a legitimate FFL holder with whom I can transfer it to. 
Firearm was Purchased new in Late Feb 2012 and the rest of the items were purchased in March 2012. All are New, in 100% condition. Besides the Bipod. I already had one and went ahead and threw this in with the sale. 
I'm willing to sell scope and gun separate. 


This gun has only been fired by interested customers. Less then 30 shots by customers. Proper barrel cleaning performed, regarding break in. Barrel isn't broke in yet. Scope zeroed at 100 yards. 300 yard zero is desired. Will let buyer do it. I also have a extra long cleaning rod (NIB) that I bought for this firearm that is included. 
TOTAL for everything: $4,800.00 OBO. Trades welcomed

Looks to be shot little previous to my ownership. Lockup, fit, and finish are fantastic. Absolutely a top-notch pistol, and quite likely my favorite 1911 (I own and have owned several). Nostalgic value for my other 1911's means this one is the one to go, even though I like it better than the others (Springfields, Colts, and a Baer).

Serial number places it just after the Clack pistols, about as close to a Clackamas model as you can get without the collector price tag. What I can find is the Clacks stopped around the 6000 serial mark, so this one is JUST after the move to yonkers. $750, comes with box and two Wilson mags. Currently wears Kimber wood grips.  Sun brings out the plum slide, but the camera makes the grips look like hell.  They're quite nice, and nearly new

The MSRP of the EMP is $1345. The lowest price I've seen one for is $1049. If you buy in-town you must still pay sales tax ($75); buy online and you pay shipping, sales tax, plus processing, background check fees, etc., pushing the price up. My EMP is much less and is already broken in. Not too bad for a weapon of this quality.

The gun functions fine, the trigger is still original setup, not to bad but not perfect. But again, the revolver is 60+ years old, it wont be perfect. 

It was a police gun. The grips are well worn. The top left strap above the cylinder is stamped UNITED STATES PROPERTY and on the right side of the frame there is a British stamping of the arrow. It is a neat gun, but I bought it for a custom build and realized after the fact that it would not be the best candidate for what I want to do.

The reason I'm putting this lovely gun up for sale is that when returning the grip to the lower (after cleaning) my friend placed the retaining spring for the selector switch (AKA Safety) he placed it in the wrong hole and jammed up the safety, I don't have the time to pull the lower apart and retrieve the spring nor do I have the time to take it to a gunsmith so I'm letting it go... This gun is worth $1500 and has only had 60 rounds through it so it's practically new.

It is the very rare lightweight model (24oz) that comes with 5 magazines and a right-handed Galco Fletch Holster.  The pistol is very clean, at least 98% and Para doesn't make this one anymore.  It has a 3.5"" barrel and an officer's grip...which means you can get all of your fingers on it.  It holds 12 rounds of .45 ACP plus one in the chamber that's a grand total of 13!!! 

The magazines sell for $30-$40 each and the Galco Fletch is $75 @ Brownells (where it was purchased).  Two mags came with the gun originally and I bought 3 more.  If you add up the total for extra mags and the holster you are getting this pistol for $600.00!!  That's a bargain, especially if you have ever priced one on Gunbroker.  I have never had a failure of any kind and have personally tested every magazine I'm selling with this gun.  You cannot buy a better CCW package, especially chambered in .45 ACP.

I have my eyes set on another toy so here are some things that I have decided I can let go.

1) Springfield Armory 1911 LOADED
Trijicon Night Sights 2009 (Still very bright)
Wilson Combat Ambi Safety (Parkerized)
Wilson Combat G.I. Recoil Guide and Plug (Stainless)
Wilson Combat Barrel Bushing (Blued)
Wilson Combat Back Strap (25 LPI, Parkerized)

Comes with original wood grips (shown below), a set of Black Rubberized Pachmyer Grips, box and papers, 2 x Kim Pro Tac Magazines (8 rd) and one stock 7 rd magazine.

I am the second owner. I do not have the original parts as they were not included. The previous owner and I have both sent a total of about 650 rounds down the pipe. It is still in great condition with only minor wear on the lower front of the slide. I will also include a Blued Wilson Combat spare slide release, a Wilson combat Stainless G.I. Thumb Safety and a Wilson Combat Stainless Bushing for free.
Asking $760

2. Smith & Wesson 686-3, 6"" Stainless (Produced from 1988-1993)
Will come with 2 HKS Speed Loaders with magnum rounds and a dual speed loader pouch. Includes generic but decent pistol case, Blackhawk Thumb Break hip holster and a thororugh cleaing.
Excellent condition, has only shot about 140 rounds which were mostly .38spcl. It still has the original wooden grips as well.
From what I have found, the dash 3 models are a bit more desirable, but of course not as much as the dash 0, 1, or 2. It does have a thin line on the cylnder but aside from that and normal wear, it is in great shape. Adjustable sights with front red ramp and rear white outline. The hammer has the actual pin on it, meaning no transfer bar. And the parts are not MIM, they are forged as the dash 3 models were, I believe, the last do to so.
Asking $700

The Mosin-Nagant (Russian: ???????? ??????) is a bolt-action, magazine fed, military rifle that was used by the armed forces of Imperial Russia and later the Soviet Union and various Eastern bloc nations. Also known as the Three-Line Rifle (Russian: ???????????? ????????), it was the first to use the 7.62x54mmR cartridge. As a front-line rifle, the Mosin-Nagant served in various forms from 1891 until the 1960s in many Eastern European nations, when the sniper rifle variant was replaced by the SVD (Russian: ??????????? ???????? ????????? — ""Snajperskaja Vintovka Dragunova""). The Mosin-Nagant is still used in many conflicts due to its ruggedness and the vast number produced during World War II.

Model 1944 Carbine — this carbine was introduced into service in late 1943 and remained in production until 1948. Its specifications are very similar to the M1938, with the major exception of having a permanently affixed, folding quadrangular-bladed bayonet. These were in use not only by the USSR, but also its various satellite nations.
