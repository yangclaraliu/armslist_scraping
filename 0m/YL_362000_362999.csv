It is an Essential Arms J-15, converted by Bushmaster. The buttstock was one of WATom's early repro's, and has been retrofitted with a hardened locking tube. The upper was custom built, a Colt (C M stamped) pre-A1 upper with a HEAVY 10"" barrel and a fat gas tube, thus not requiring a moderator. It runs flawlessly, and fast--I'm figuring somewhere around 1100rpm. 

There are some scratches and dings on the lower and upper; if you are looking for a safe queen, this is not it. If you want something that looks close to the original, this is more like it. 

It comes with a complete LM7 upper, tuned by Eric, with two 100rd belts and roughly 750 plastic links. Also included will be 25-50 USGI mags (haven't rounded them all up and counted yet) and a Beta mag. The Beta mag has an aluminum tower, cut down from a GI mag, but is not running perfectly yet. 

I am looking at a few different options in sale/trade: 

1.) HK sear with MP5/10 or MP5K clone host. 

2.) M11A1 in .380 with Lage MAX-11 upper and $11k. 

3.) Steyr AUG with registered sear and 9mm conversion kit. 

4.) 1919 shorty with .22 conversion 

5.) $15k 

I have supplied some photos. Excuse the drywall, I am in the middle of renovation. I can take more pictures for those seriously interested. I am in Ohio, and as always, would prefer an Ohio transfer. Please, no tire kickers, and I am not interested in parting it out.

Let me start by saying that it has a life-time warranty, and I have made a lot of tweeks to it to make it a good carry gun. First I trimmed and polished the feed ramp, so the gun chambers correctly every time. I also did some trigger work to give it a lighter pull. I do have an az ccw and I shoot this gun every weekend and it does perform flawlessly. Since I used it as a carry gun I had some wood grips made for it. I carried this gun for months chambered and ready, and what do you know im still here, there where no mysterious accidental discharges. Bottom line is im offering this gun today at a very fair price, so I don’t want to here about the reputation of the gun, or about how you can buy it at some internet site for less money, if you don’t think the price is fair please don’t respond.I also have an ultradeep concealment holster that is brand new for this gun. This holster allows you to carry the gun in your waist line with your shirt tucked in, and still be able to draw with out pulling up you shirt.this holster is designed to wrap around the weapon and your hip/thigh to completely conceal the weapon but still give fast access to it when needed. The holster is made here locally and will be catching on fast. I use the same holster right now and I carry at work in my business casual clothes, and there isent even an imprint on my pant leg. If interested in the gun I can show you the holster and let you be the judge. Im asking 160.00 or best offer and if you are buying, you come to me, just like if I was buying I would come to you. So keep that in mind. The gun comes with a hard case, 2 magazines, the life time warranty, the ultradeep concealment holster and a full box of rounds. Now that is a great deal for 160 bucks. if interested please text me at REDACTED for questions

If you don't know about these, take a look at the manufacturer's page, https://www.lasermax.com/ProductDetails/tabid/127/ ProductID/289/lms-1141p/Default.aspx

This device replaces the spring and guide rod below the barrel, so that the laser beam is emitted a small part of an inch below the bore, and exactly aligned.  Switch it on, put the dot on the target, pull the trigger, and watch a hole appear right where the beam was.  It is completely internal, so once installed, the only way you can even see it is the lens right below the barrel.  Won't interfere with a holster, and leaves your accessory rail free for other things.  Installation takes about 20 seconds, no kidding.  Bring yours along and I'll show you how.

The beam ""scintillates"" so that it is easy to find, and it's bright enough that even in fairly bright sunlight, it's easy to see at the sort of range that you would use a handgun.

This unit comes in the original factory box including instructions, factory check sheet, a few spare parts, and five new batteries (it takes three at a time, so that's one complete set and 2/3 of another), as well as the working set currently installed.

It is used, but you'll only know by me telling you so, and the lube on the recoil springs.  Great addition to your carry weapon – just point & shoot.

$180 cash and it's yours.  I prefer a FTF transaction anywhere in the SA area, but I'll ship it under the right conditions if a local buyer doesn't scoop it up first.  SOLD PENDING PAYMENT"

140,http://www.armslist.com/posts/362140,For Sale/Trade:  STEEL BOX Outdoor Job Site Tool Storage Box,"Woodbridge/Manassas, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 180,"Listed On: Sunday, April 8, 2012",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is one of those heavy steel outdoor construction site tool boxes that you see all the time. This one was originally sold by Lowe's hardware store under the KOBALT brand name and would make an excellent, low cost alternative secure storage solution for firearms. (Adding your own safe de-humidifier, not included, would be a good idea.)

The outside looks like hell but the inside is in very good condition. I used it to store everything from electronic equipment to small power tools to spray paint cans and various other things you might find in a garage or workshop.

The box has undergone a number of color changes and endured countless rain and snow storms while preserving the interior contents remarkably well. Far better than I ever expected it would.

Originally bought the box new years ago for about $275.00 so they probably cost more new by now. I don't think Lowe's has boxes like this any more but there are a lot of other companies out there making them. The box is secured by using two of your own padlocks which are inserted into each of the two holes you see in the front of the box where they can not be reached by bolt cutters. (Padlocks not included.) 

DIMENTIONS: 2ft. tall, 2ft. deep and 4ft. wide is the main box, not including the steel skids under each end. There is also a 3 1/2 inch steel troft inside.
There is a sticker inside it which says DAWS MFG.
 Part Number 37211296, Model IND48SS

I have multiple online ads so please mention which item you are contacting me about. If you are reading this, the ad is almost certainly still unsold.

Door to door transportation is available with your assistance lifting it into the truck and an extra $2.00 per mile paid in advance.

The Jimenez Arms J.A. .380 is quite possibly one of the simplest, easiest to use and most comfortable compact .380's on the market today. Jimenez Arms includes such features as: a comfortable stance and an extended finger rest located at the bottom of the magazine. Other manufacturers offer this feature only on specialty clips at higher prices. Jimenez Arms, however, includes this feature at no extra cost. If you're in the market for a compact .380 and price, accuracy and comfort is a factor- the Jimenez Arms J.A. 380 is your solution.

So I put the bolt back through and now the slide will not slide back. So you get it for $100 or trade? If interested I can email pics, it dosn't look that back about 65% or so. If interested just email me!"

this is an Italian made box magazine fed pump action 12 gauge.  it has an aluminum alloy receiver making it very light.  also the ammo all being directly under the receiver makes for a very well balanced gun.  you don't get that nose heavy feeling like you do with tube magazine fed guns with this kind of round capacity.  also the pump action is extremely smooth.  the magazine spring takes the place of the shell lifter making the forward motion of the forearm just as light as the backward motion.  it is truly a world of difference between your typical mossberg 500 or remington 870 type pumps.   the round capacity on this gun is 7+1.

the guns previous owner obviously didnt appreciate what a fine firearm this is and scratched up the barrel pretty noticeably.  not deep gouges or anything, just the black matte finish is scratched off and you can see shiny metal underneath.  this is a shooter, not a safe queen.  thus the much lower price than you see other places online.

One is a 700 Tactical, 20” 1:9 twist barrel.  Purchased new 2/2/12.  Broke in properly, shot 10 shots cleaning after every shot, 30 shots cleaning after every 3 shots, 45 shots cleaning after every 5 shots (total round count is exactly 85 rounds).  The last 5 shot, 100 yard group measured .499” and was shot with 69 grain Sierra MatchKings seated 2.30”over 26.0 grains of Varget in Federal Gold Medal brass with Federal Gold Medal primers.  It has Leupold Mark 4 2 piece bases and Maxima quick release scope rings in medium height.  All finishes are matte black.  I have original box and paperwork.  No defects and as new.  The other is a Remington Model 700 .223 BDL Custom Deluxe, 24” 1:12 twist barrel, with a Leupold VX-IIc 3-9x40mm scope with Butler Creek flip open lens covers in Leupold low rings on Leupold 2 piece bases. The rear site has been turned around to accommodate the scope. The gun is in good condition with a few handling marks. There are a few smudges in the clear coat on the stock and there are a few imperfections in the blueing on the barrel. No pits or rust on any of the metal though. The scope glass is perfect but there are some scratches on the scope body. The bore is in excellent shape and the muzzle crown is perfect. The trigger has been adjusted and is very light and crisp. I loaded some 52 gr. Sierra MatchKings seated 2.2” over 26.5 gr. of Hodgdon 4895 in Federal Gold Medal Brass with Federal Gold Medal primers. I shot a five shot group from a cold clean bore. I had the usual cold, unfouled bore shot that was 1/2"" from the rest of the group. The other 4 shots were easily covered by a quarter. The next 5 shot group was the same except the cold bore shot was not as far from the rest of the group. I was shooting prone with a bipod and monopod at 100 yards with both rifles.  The aluminum case is a T.Z. Case International and is lockable.  Complete package for $1,300 plus shipping.  Contact REDACTED if interested.  Thanks."

I think it maybe what they call a Brown Bess.  It was pulled out of a basement in CT and there is no question in my mind that it is original. Plus you couldn’t make a replica this rough. The pieces for the most part are all there but the trigger guard does not appear to be the original as it does not properly fit in the cut out of the stock.   The only things I believe to be missing are a few screws.  You can pull back the firing mechanism and it does work (so the spring is not broken) There does not appear to be any rifling in the barrel, if there was it is rusted away or covered with dirt. The stock is cracked and it needs to be glued back together. 


I have no idea of its value and if it’s worth something I will most likely sell it, if it is of little value I will clean it up (cannot ruin a antique of little value) and put it over my fireplace.  So, if you are interested make me an offer on it. If you have questions, what more photos etc. please let me know."

The SL, which stands for 'stretch-lightweight', incoroprates everything a shooter needs in a quality light-weight base model rifle. Price and weight were the most important factors when developing the SL. With the M6-SL, LWRCI has brought to the market the lightest factory piston driven rifle to date. The SL comes standard with Magpul furniture. A MOE mid-length handguard, MOE Stock, and MOE pistol grip provide excellent handling characteristics, while minimizing added weight. The SL utilizes the 'stretch' or mid-length piston system, providing a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots. The most distinct feature of the SL is the barrel. The barrel still utilizes LWRCI's NiCorr surface conversion technology on a cold-hammer-forged barrel, but the barrel is of a smaller diameter to reduce weight. The SL comes standard with the EXO (nickel-boron) plated Advanced Combat Bolt, one piece EXO coated carrier, and the EXO coated enhanced fire control group. The SL also comes standard with a Daniel Defense A1.5 fixed rear sight and a fixed A2 front sight post. The SL is a great addition to the LWRCI family of rifles. It provides users with an extremely lightweight rifle that incorporates our patented short-stroke piston operating system, has all of the advanced coatings that make our rifles the best in the world, and does so at an entry level price.

And that is precisely what you see before you, a radically customized .40 S&W Para-Ordinance hi-capacity combat pistol featuring the most advanced new materials and most refined new technology available anywhere at any price. 

This is a racegun, a gun that combines the speed of a sprinter with the heart of a marathoner. It's a gun that can go the distance with 16 uninterrupted shots of the hottest new .40 S&W cartridge. Plus, here's a gun that can blaze furiously ahead with the blinding speed of the lightest and fastest lock mechanism available today with parts made of titanium, carbon fiber and magnesium.

Bill Laughridge, master gunsmith and consummate craftsman, conceived the design of the entire pistol and directed its production. Establishing himself early on as the expert on the Browning Hi-Power pistol, the 20-year-veteran of the gunsmithing profession has also been successfully customizing Colt autos and S&W revolvers in his Cylinder & Slide Shop that he has owned and operated for the past 12 years.

All 3 are chambered in 8mm 8x57.  The short one is completely numbers matching down to the action screws, barrel and stock has been shortened, and still has the original .318"" diameter bore size.  The next one is in completely original configuration and numbers matching, except for the bolt face parts.  The bolt head, extractor, ejector, and firing pin were replaced.  That one is an original German ""S"" conversion, re-rifled to .323"" bore to fire the modern 8x57 round, in the early 1900's.  The last one was a Gew. 88 made in Germany, that was sold to the Turks, and modernized by the Turks to 1938 M38 specs. It had the barrel changed to a K98 8mm barrel, and K98 type stock with bolt disassembly socket in the stock.   I have fired the last one and it's a tack driver.  All 3 have EXCELLENT bores.   These are nice guns, and would make a good addition to any beginners gun collection.  Price is $700 and I will ship. Although all 3 technically qualify as antiques, being pre-1899 makes, they can and will shoot modern 8x57 ammo. So these must ship to an FFL.  If you live in Pa., you can legally purchase them direct, with proof of residency and age i.d. card, i.e. picture drivers license.  $700 takes them but I would accept offers.

 Scope mounts come with this gun.The scope is NOT included in this price. This gun bridges the gap between a Tikka T3 Lite and a Sako 75/85.

I have approximately 50 rounds thru this gun. Wether or not you buy into ythe barrel break in philosophy.This gun had a proper barrel break in.
I painted the stock.The stock was removed prior to painting. Yes I know you may or may not like it:) LOL But the gun is a shooter. I would be open to trades preferably Glocks Springfield xd or xdm or a sig. Let me know what you have.

I just got back from looking at another 380 acre tract of land that is divided into 5 acre lots that are already cleared and could be made into mini-farms with little effort. Some of these lots have a view that you can see over 20 miles.
Again, thanks. You guys are the best.
Sincerely,
Mark"

These are simply the best cameras I have used to date. The trigger speed on Cuddebacks are faster than any other and it really shows, more deer in the center of the shot and less missed. They are both still in great condition and last really long on batteries even set at the shortest 30 second intervals. Both still have the mounting straps which work quite well because they can be tightened to almost any size tree. These cost me $230 plus tax a piece new, I'm looking to get $150 each for these.The only trades I would really be interested in at the time is things that go bang, Cuddeback Attack IR, or possibly other high end name brand hunting items.

This gun has the shorter youth stock on it. Blued barrel and synthetic stock. It has an  adjustable trigger similar to the Savage Accutrigger. I have shot it and with plain jane factory ammo I had a 3 shot group of about 1 and1/4 inches. I have not had a chance to handload for it but  I have no doubt that this gun will shoot under an inch. I am also selling it with the scope.It has a Mueller 3-10X40 illuminated reticle scope on it. The scope retails for over $200 but real world pricing is $150 to $160.This would make an excellent rifle for a youth. I am not 100% sure but you can probably get a full size stock from Marlin for a decent price or even buy a laminated Boyds stock for about $100.

Please don't make lowball offers as it doesn't benefit me or you. All my listing are reasonably priced. Thanks for looking.

$400 OBO for scope and gun. $300 OBO for just the gun.
