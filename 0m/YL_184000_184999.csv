From Ableammo.com:  Product Details & Specifications
     A new affordable semi-auto loading pistol, called the Cougar joins the Stoeger family. This double-action pistol is available in either .40 Smith & Wesson (S&W) or 9mm Parabellum. Stoeger’s Cougar is the same design as the aluminum-frame, Italian-made Cougars that Beretta originally introduced in the mid-1990s. The only difference is that the new Cougars are manufactured in Turkey and offered at very attractive prices.
     The original Cougar line was developed to provide a more compact alternative to full-size pistols chambered for the 9mm and .40 S&W. The basic Cougar platform was designed for the .40 S&W with the 9mm chambering added later. The Cougar features a barrel that rotates to lock with the slide, providing greater strength and accuracy. The barrels are cold hammer-forged and the bores are hard chrome lined for exceptional strength and durability.
     Other features include rounded edges for snag-free drawing, removable front sight, matte-black finish, ambidextrous safety, and combat-style trigger guard. Incorporating the finest technology and maintaining proven semi-auto features, the Cougar is a light, compact and reliable pistol. The Cougar comes with two high-capacity magazines—the .40 S&W magazine holds 11 rounds and the 9mm magazine takes 15 rounds. Accuracy, reliability and manageable recoil make the Cougar a perfect choice for home defense, or for fun shooting at targets. Stoeger’s new Cougar embodies the kind of affordable value that you can stake your life on.

Got a great deal on it used but the semi auto action and tube mag were filthy. Good gun and as described, just needed some TLC. It's been completely disassembled and cleaned inside and out. The action is buttery smooth again and though Model 60 triggers are notoriously heavy this one is operating like new again. No ill feelings toward it I just need the safe space AND a couple extra bucks for this: http://www.hausofguns.com/category/g...ding-an-ak-47/

This really is a beautiful little rifle. Asking $110 for it as-is. Must be able to legally own a firearm. And I know it's JUST a .22 but I still need to see a valid CO ID before we shake hands on it.  Also face to face only. I'll drive as much as $15-$20 to meet up, or around I-25. Cash only, no scams, no lowballs, don't be an idiot.

Great pistol for Concealed Carry. I have bought a different CC pistol and no longer need this one. This pistol is in great shape and has already been warranty repaired by Colorado Gun Works. These pistols have a factory problem of a spring jumping out the notch that is suppose to ride in and then fires erractically. CGW has machined the notch a little deeper and then inserted the spring and staked it off. Unlike a lot of other Bersa's out there, this one will now fire reliably when needed. Great pistol, just not needed anymore. Comes with factory box, key for integrated trigger lock, external trigger lock, factory test round, blackhawk holster, and factory magazine. One of the coolest features of this pistol is that fact that it is a Double Action/Single Action pistol with a De-cocker. This means you can breach a bullet into the chamber and then de-cock it. So then if you needed to defend yourself it will take a harder, safer, double action trigger pull to get the first round off. Then every round after that is single action. Love this feature. Alot of your smaller CC pistol are Double Action only, of which is not nearly as accurate as single action. Email if you would like to set up a meet to look at this pistol.

Wood on it is flawless, and the only firing it has done was when I cleaned out the cosmoline thoroughly and put around 40 perfect rounds through her. 

Comes complete with spike bayonet, correct green canvas and leather sling, and cleaning kit in the buttstock. Also included will be as many stripper clips as I can find (10-20) and all the 7.62x39 ammo I have left. It's all current production, non corrosive, it totals about 240 rounds. Also included is a spare cleaning kit and a spare cleaning rod.

I believe $350 is a fair asking price for this set up with everything included, but feel free to shoot me offers. Always open to interesting trades, worst I can say is no. Can be boot up or down, but remember, cash is king. 

Prefer face to face, in the Louisville area but will travel a reasonable distance for the sale.

Overview:
One of the most attractive, and simultaneously, the most practical over-the-counter centerfire rifles Remington has ever built — the Model 700™ Mountain Rifle LSS (Laminated Stock Stainless) has quickly become a favorite for hunters seeking a versatile, lightweight rifle without sacrificing full-bore range or accuracy.
The Model 700™ Mountain Rifle's clean, classic stock design, with straight-line comb angled slightly downward towards the muzzle and sculptured cheek piece on the left side is a style still favored by many custom stockmakers. The gracefully-tapered 22-inch barrel without sights produces a rifle capable of handling mountain-level ranges without draining the hunter's energy to get there.
Visit the NEW Remington 700 Network website 
The barreled action is produced from 416A stainless steel and is set in a handsome, elements-resistant, satin-finished, brown two-tone laminated stock. Other features include crisp cut checkering, black fore-end tip and grip cap, and hinged floorplate magazine. 
Key Features:
Slim 22"" mountain contour barrel to reduce weight Hinged floor plate magazine
Receiver machined from solid-steel bar stock resulting in uniformity and strength
Cylindrical receiver design provides a solid bedding area in the stock for consistent shot placement
Recessed bolt face locks up inside the counter-bored breech of the barrel which is surrounded by the receiver, forming ""three-rings-of-steel"" enclosing the cartridge case head for unparalleled strength
Integral extractor is set in a groove inside the rim of the bolt face, uniformly supporting the cartridge head"

The legendary Barnett Commando crossbow has been seen in many Ninja movies and major motion pictures including James Bonds ""For Your Eyes Only"", Christian Bales ""Reign of Fire"" and used as the platform for Chewbacca's ""Bowcaster"" crossbow from the Star Wars movies. 

What makes this crossbow legendary is it's unique hinged pivoting stock, locking arms and cocking hooks with self-aligning roller guides, this allows for faster loading during competition, hunting and target shooting. The Barnett Commando basically breaks to cock, like a shotgun breaks to load shells.

This is a fun collector’s item that is ready to fire. 150lb draw weight. There are no bolts. You must go to the Barnett site to find the correct size. Shipping and insurance are extra and will be calculated after the sale.
