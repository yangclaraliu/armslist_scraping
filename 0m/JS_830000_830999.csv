This gun has some wear and tear on it. But it works out as the concealed carry gun you don’t mind losing when you find yourself needing to use it. With all off that said it was never neglected. This firearm has always been properly cleaned after every use and is in great working condition. So light you will forget you have it on you (trust me I have), and the +P round packs one hell of a punch. Normally these would run you north of $500 but this is a smoking deal"

- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- Cleaning kit, sling, and 1 magazine are standard.
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness.

This gun is truly an incredible hand cannon!  I replaced the grips with a set of butler creek grips to cover the backstrap to help absorb heavy load recoil.

I've owned a Beretta, a Taurus and I got rid of the other two before this one. It's an EXACT clone of the Beretta (minus a chrome lined barrel). After all, Beretta rep's went to Turkey to help build the plant. When they came out their MSRP was $549.95 which really meant you could get one for about $400. It's a really nice pistol with less than 100 rounds through it. I've also added Hogue wrap around grips. Recent trade fell through as the gun I was trading for ended up being a POS so now's your chance.  I only have one mag because that's all it came with new.  Trade for handgun only."

I FIRE THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS A MONTH AND WOULD SAY THE BLAZER, PMC BRONZE AND THE REMINGTON ARE EXCELLENT ROUNDS AS WELL. THE PPU IS FAIRLY NEW BUT SO FAR SO GOOD. THANKS AGAIN AND LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED SOME."

The response received is below. While not committing to new gun control measures there is mention of ""access to firearms"" and talk of hunting. As we all know, we have numerous laws already controlling ""access to firearms"" and the 2nd amendment has nothing to do with hunting. Kay Hagan is a Democratic senator up for her first re-election in 2014 in a state where the governor's mansion and both houses of the General Assembly are now controlled by the GOP. Write and/or call Kay Hagan and tell her: "" No more gun control."" That means no 'ban' or NFA registration of ""Assault weapons"". No restrictions on the purchase of ammunition, no restriction on high capacity magazines, NO MORE GUN CONTROL. Instead we need police in the schools that don't already have them and better access control so just anyone cannot walk in off the street whenever they want. Magazine bans and ammunition bans have already been introduced in the house. Diane Feinstein has promised her ""Assault weapons"" ban which would require, among numerous other things, NFA registration and a $200 tax on ""Assault Weapons"" such as the AR-15 and pretty much anything that Diane thinks looks scary. New legislation will be introduced in the Senate on the 22nd.  Kay Hagan needs to hear loud and clear that more infringement of the 2nd amendment and more laws for criminals to ignore is not the solution to violence in America.

""
January 10, 2013
Dear Friend,

Thank you for contacting me regarding the horrific tragedy that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. I appreciate hearing your thoughts on this issue, and my thoughts and prayers remain with the victims and families of this senseless and appalling act of violence.

In the wake of the shooting in Newtown, which left twenty-six innocent members of the community dead, many of them young children, Americans across the country are searching for answers on how we can prevent such tragic events from happening in the future. I believe we must do all we can to put laws and policies in place to prevent future tragedies such as this one. Doing that will require a common-sense debate on a comprehensive approach that examines all relevant issues, including access to firearms, mental healthcare, and the prevalence of violence in video games and media. Additionally, Senator Feinstein has stated her intent to introduce legislation concerning access to firearms at the start of the 113th Congress. To date, that legislation has not been introduced. As always, it is important that we not unnecessarily infringe on the legitimate Second Amendment rights of responsible gun owners.

Like you, I have always been an advocate for Second Amendment rights. My family, like the great state of North Carolina, has a long tradition of hunting and gun ownership, and I take great pride in that heritage. During my tenure in the North Carolina Senate I continuously supported the responsible use of firearms. As your United States Senator, I will always be committed to protecting these fundamental, constitutional rights.
Again, thank you for contacting my office. It is truly an honor to represent North Carolina in the United States Senate, and I hope you will not hesitate to contact me in the future should you have any further questions or concerns. If you would like to stay informed on my work in the Senate, you can sign up for my e-newsletter, follow me on Twitter at @SenatorHagan, or visit my Facebook page.

Sincerely,



Kay R. Hagan

Comes with scope rails. Feel free to txt me at REDACTED with any questions.

I have his number if you want to call and ask him any specific questions about this gun.

Solid (not carbon-fiber) Dpms lower receiver with CAA ergonomic grip and CAA triggerguard.
Magpul ACS (commercial spec) stock and Magpul vertical foregrip.

Has a quad rail and quad rail gas block.
Barrel is 16 inches in length 1 by 9 twist and is not chrome lined

Harris Bipod and Rota-pod Adaptor: This is where it gets interesting, The Harris bipod is six to 9 inches long (depending on where you want it) and is also special in that is allows for the rifle to lean right or left. The rota pod adaptor then allows for the rifle to pan right and left. If you text me for pictures i can show you exactly how this works. Its pretty awesome to see. NOTE: that the second picture shows how the rifle can lean to one side with the bipod.

EoTech sight: This is also pretty sweet, this particular model is the M553. I just got this brand spankin new from cabelas 2 days ago. Sighted it the best I could but I recommend a professional to sight it perfectly, which I will do if no one buys. This is a top of the line holographic sight, and also is compatible with infrared night vision goggles. I have it paired with a magpul flip up front sight, and will also give you the extra back sight as well.

Every single part on this gun is brand new, it has not been fired. I was the first person to oil it. Also comes with one magpul magazine (I have more if you want to buy.)

If you want to buy keep in mind that first the price is firm, its was incredibly expensive to find the gun AND all the parts with the mad rush for guns this past month, and if you lowball me I just wont even respond.. 
Second, I will be asking to see your drivers license, if your not from Texas don't bother.
I will have a form printed out that you will sign, or I will not sell, it will have your DL# and the Serial Number of the gun (just for my personal records), as well as a date of purchase and both of our signatures. (If you want to see my drivers license that is fine too). I will not compromise on any of this.

Introducing the Ruger 10/22 Takedown. Readily separated into two subassemblies, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger 10/22. As reliable and accurate as every 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America's favorite rimfire rifle by your side.

The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used.

The Ruger 10/22 Takedown is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves which hold the subassemblies. External pockets with MOLLE webbing provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other accessories. Multiple attachment points for the padded, single shoulder strap offer different carrying options.

The 4.67-pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37"" long when assembled; each subassembly is less than 20 1/4"" long when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action and ten round rotary magazine (one magazine is provided), the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers legendary 10/22 reliability in a compact and portable package.

Law Enforcement Use
In December 2003, after outperforming 10 other manufacturers in rifle abuse tests, Rock River Arms was awarded a contract with the Drug Enforcement Administration for a minimum of 5,000 LAR-15 rifles to be purchased over five years. As a result of Rock River Arms winning the DEA contract, other federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Marshals, have also obtained Rock River Arms weapons under piggyback contracts."

This has the optics rail on the left side, but the scope in the photo is not included in the purchase.  I love this rifle because it is beautiful and a great shooter.

READ THIS: IMPORTANT!!!
I am not trying to scare you, but if you ever thought of buying an AR from me or anybody else NOW is the time

The Brady Law requires that the FBI correct erroneous denials of firearms purchases. And it requires that it reply, initially, within five days. According to attorneys familiar with the problem, the FBI NEVER, EVER, EVER complies with the law. In fact, it increasingly tells aggrieved legitimate purchasers to ""sue us"" -- at a potential cost of tens of thousands of dollars. 
This is the inherent problem with any background check, where gun buyers' names are given to a government bureaucrat. Is there any way to make sure that once a name is entered into a computer, that it doesn't stay there permanently?

This concern is especially valid, considering how federal agents are already skirting the laws against gun owner registration. Several dealers around the country have informed GOA that the ATF is increasingly going into gun shops and just xeroxing all of the 4473's, giving them the names of every gun owner who purchased a gun through that shop -- and setting up the basis for a national registration system.

This is illegal under the 1986 McClure-Volkmer law, but that has apparently not stopped it from being done. If every gun in America has to go through a dealer, this will create a mechanism to compile a list of every gun owner in America. And, as we have seen with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has just been legislatively handed such a list, when that happens, the talk immediately turns to ""confiscation."""

CHIAPPA 1911-22 / AWC VALKYRIE

This is in stock on a Form 3 in Oklahoma and ready to be transferred tax free to your local Class III SOT dealer. That transfer takes weeks, not months and then you're ready to fill out your paperwork and submit your $200 tax. So it is much faster to buy this one that is already in stock than buy one that's already on a form 4 or order one from the manufacturer. This is a Class III NFA item and as such follows all NFA guidelines.

Visa, Mastercard, Discover and American Express all accepted!!!

I also take trades like hunting rifles, tactical rifles, handguns and quality optics. Just email me directly at Justin@darcopsarmory.com or use the Gunbroker “ask seller a question” feature and tell me what you have. Maybe we can work out a trade or use it as a partial down payment.

WE DO SHIP TO CALIFORNIA! It is up to you, the buyer, to make sure this is legal in your area, and if it is we are an approved seller to the state of California and are more than happy to serve you.

We are an FFL and will accept trade-ins, shipped to us or brought in locally, from individuals. No need to pay your FFL a fee for doing it when we can walk you through the process.

I also set up payment plans on expensive items like this one so just email me and let me know what down payment and monthly payment you can afford and maybe we can put it on lay-a-way for you.

This item is new, we are a licensed gun shop and we received it from the manufacturer or a distributor. It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public. This usually means you will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened.

CHIAPPA 1911-22

The Chiappa 1911-22 model is a rimfire, semi-automatic pistol chambered in .22 LR. It is a straight blowback pistol in .22 Long Rifle only, with a fixed barrel solidly attached to the frame.

The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy and steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. Polymer is used for the magazine catch, mainspring housing, non-rotating grip safety filler, and the body and follower of the 10-round single-column magazine.

It is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun. Safety features include the traditional left-side thumb safety and a gun lock on the right rear side of the slide. A third safety feature is the gun’s automatic trigger safety, which blocks the trigger until the slide is fully forward into battery. Finally, the hammer features a half-cock notch. The front sight is a fixed sight and has been designed to allow extra material so that it can be filed to adjust for the individual shooter.

The Chiappa is a fixed barrel blow back design that maintains reliable functioning with minimal friction. The reliable return of the slide in combination w/ fixed front and rear sights maintans a constant return and quick, accurate follow-up shots. It includes two 10-rd magazines.

AWC VALKYRIE TI 22 SUPPRESSOR.

The Valkyrie TI is a super light-weight titanium suppressor. The AWC Valkyrie has an interchangeable rear mounting system, which allows you to swap between multiple host weapons regardless of thread pattern.

This is AWC's nicest titanium can, and it is made from solid titanium stock; it is not made from titanium tubing like others who use cheaper methods that don't give as nice of a build quality. This AWC model uses a solid welded fully machined blast baffle. It’s forward purging design means gases cool faster while moving forward more efficiently.

The Valkyrie offers unbelievably accurate suppressed shooting. The Valkyrie is far and away the BEST 22 CAN ON THE MARKET and is of course also suited for the 17 HMR and 22 magnum in other firearms. The mounting systems you can change between are (universal): 1/2 x28, 3/8 x24, P22, SIG Mosquito, 3/8 x24 Tang & Custom. Because of the AWC rear mounting system, it is very easy to change the can from one thread pitch to another. Best of all, the AWC Valkyrie never has to be cleaned!

Shipping/handling is going to be $55 and insurance will be added at 1.75% of the item's value to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping. The price is for certified funds, a credit card will add 5% to the price. The value of all merchandise traded will be treated like certified funds; therefore, this item will still be subject to shipping and insurance charges. Because of additional paperwork and time to process the shipment, California orders on firearms will be charged an additional $25 transfer fee. If wiring funds there will be a $25 charge. for more information contact cobyshearco@rockmail.com"

The Lake City Army Ammunition Plant is where most of the small arms ammunition used by US Armed Forces is made. It's operated by a government contractor called ATK. And they're allowed to sell their excess production on the civilian market each year. They do so under the Federal label. I tested this ammunition in a colt LE AR with true M4 feed ramps, and multiple mags. It offered perfect function in all of them. There isn't really much to say here. This ammo is designed to operate flawlessly, and it delivers."
