As you can see, it is the rare two-tone model.  It has had exactly 100 rounds through it, been cleaned and kept in immaculate condition.  There are no scratches/marks on the gun.

This great gun comes with the original case and all of the items that came with the case.  This includes the 3 high capacity 20-round mags.  I am also selling this gun with a Fobus paddle holster that is made specifically for this gun.  Finally, the gun will come with 420 rounds of the 5.7x28mm ammo that is becoming very hard to find as well as extremely expensive.  These rounds are all new and not reloads.

I am looking to either sell this gun outright or I will take a partial trade + cash to make up the difference.  The only gun(s) that I am looking for are:  S&W Shield (in .40), Walther PPS (in .40) or would possibly consider a SA XDS (slim in .45).  They should be in similar condition as my gun, extremely low round count and with the box and all included accessories.

I am looking to get a total of $1500.00 for the entire package (gun, holster & ammo).  I will not break up this package, it is sold as a complete set.  This price is firm and not subject to negotiation.  If you take a look at other FN-57's that have been sold on this site and what ammo is being sold for, you know that this is an extremely good deal.

All transactions will be FTF.  I will require that you have a valid DL, CCW Permit and be willing to sign a bill of sale.  Thanks for looking & have a great New Year!"

Also included are the 5 round magazine that came with the gun and the 8 round magazine that I bought from the gunshop on the same day.

It is in good condition, probably only put about 50 rounds through it tops, and stored it properly. I have included the old-stock in case you wish to put it back on, a very simple process, for those of you who prefer the traditional stock. 

I bought this gun originally for $700 and adding the pistol grip cost me another $70, so the price here is more than fair. 

I am looking to sell it because shotguns aren't my biggest interest, it's too loud for shooting in the area I live in, and I am also looking to buy a 357. With that said, if you have a 357, I am willing to consider trading for one and a bit of extra money(depending on quality/make of the 357)"

The HK High-Reliability 30rd Steel Magazine is the Mercedes of AR-15 magazines! It has a well executed design, special attention to production tolerances, a steel magazine housing and follower and a proprietary HK ""Maritime"" anticossosion coating. It is considered by users in elite US military and law enforcement units as the best AR-15/M-16/M4 magazine in the world. In US military testing, the HK magazine improved feeding reliability by 30-50% overall. The Maritime coating easily surpasses the US MIL-STD-810 E salt fog test. During this test the magazines were exposed to a 100 hour salt fog and then stored three days at ambient temperature. After this procedure each magazine was fully loaded and fired twice with no problems. The superior function was validated during three separate tests by the British MoD in arctic, jungle, and desert environments during the firing of more than 1/2 million rounds. *Note: This magazine has the following markings: 5.56 x 45 Restricted Law Enforcement/Government Use Only 10-94; Heckler & Kock GmbH - Made in Germancy; Heckler & Koch Inc.

FROM THE MANUFACTURER: The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle. The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots. 

Overall length of the barrel is 16"" (14.7"" barrel with pinned/welded muzzle device) so it is not a Class 3 NFA item.  LWRC or any competent armorer can switch out to a different muzzle device."

If you don't know a lot about AR15s, please talk to a friend who does, I believe he/she will explain what a truly amazing deal this Custom AR-15 would have been three weeks ago before the crazy price gouging, and how it's even more of a steal now.  This is certainly one of those AR-15ss worth buying to keep forever.  If you are going to buy an AR15 that you want to get before any potential ban, this would be it.

Chambered in 300AAC Blackout (300BLK). Do some research to find out about this awesome round. Basically it's 30-30 for the AR Platform.  Better than the AK round, using a .308 bullet in an AR Platform, giving the AR15 some much needed punch! Picture shows a 5.56 in a stock USGI Mag on the left, and a 300BLK in a stock USGI on the right. The 300BLK uses every single AR15 stock part except the barrel! magazines, bolt, everything.

Only modification is a US made FAL style pistol grip. Should provide a lifetime of service, as good as a WASR gets really, my interests are just leading me elsewhere. Will include 1 surplus 30rd mag and one nib tapco smooth side 30rd mag(new, hard to find magazine)."

I purchased this rifle a few days ago and put 50 rounds through it. It comes with a carrying bag, sling, cleaning kit, front sight tool, one 20 round mag, two 30 round mags, and 80 rounds of ammunition. You probably know what this was worth three weeks ago and probably realize the price gouging given the recent events and panic of the masses. With that said if you expect me to ask 1,400.00 from you, you are wrong, I'm not that vulturistic. However with that said, if you offer me 700.00 I'll politely pass on your offer. I didn't buy this rifle with inentions of selling it to make a buck, but as with anything I own, I'll sell it for the right price or trade offer. Basically I'm listing this to see what offers I will get. Thankyou."

The rifle is not the base modle Colt .22, and looks and feels like any regular .223 Colt M4 and was that was the reason I bought it when they first came out two years ago. comes with a 30 round Magazine. 

This is the M4 Ops, and is an upgraded version of the .22 M4 Carbine.  Instead of the standard forearm found on the carbine, the Ops has an RIS, or Rail Interface System, that provides tactical railing on four sides allowing for you to mount a variety of available accessories.  Additionally, the carry handle that's on the carbine is also replaced by a detachable rear sight making the M4 Ops an ideal optic-ready rimfire rifle.

Okay, I tried to be reasonable and open this up to offers, but everybody wants to buy it for $0.40/rd (probably so they can resell it for profit). Check out ar15.com or gunbroker before submitting your offers. Even the cheaper American Eagle PMC stuff is selling for $0.60/rd right now. I am priced at $0.65 since this is the more desirbale Lake City, NATO headstamped ammo with the 62-gr projectile. Open to REASONABLE offers. I am willing to split this up (within reason). If you want 500, I'm sure we can work something out. If you want 20, you'd better shop somewhere else. 

I'll need to see your FOID card before the deal takes place. No forms or copies -- just need to make sure you have one."

It has been stored in its case and in a safe since new.  It was taken apart this week and cleaned and cleaned after each use (has been fired at the range 2 times) and has the original box and book.  (The lock for the trigger has been miss-placed so it is not included).  At my $850 asking price I will include 100 rounds of Winchester Magnum Ammo (25 rounds are in each of the 2 magazines now, I never store them full).  I will also include a rail mounted laser which is easily switch on with one finger and is laser bore-sited zeroed to the barrel at 30ft.  (50 or 60 rounds of .22mag JHP will put a serious hurt on anything that comes creeping up on you and your family in the middle of the night). These pistols are hard to come by may be the best you can buy.  Not an import, these are 100% USA made. 

I am interested in a partial trade + cash for a quality compact or sub-compact pistol.  I am selling a pistol with the original box and books and would like the same in a trade...  It is not required but I will not give full trade value for a pistol that does not have it's original equipment.  (example: XDs and XDM come with back-straps and holsters and I'll want that stuff).  You may email me with your contact information and I'll get back to you.  I can email or text pictures if you like.  

I would also consider selling my NIB (New-in-the-Box) PMR-30 for the right offer and keep the one I have fired for myself.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier.
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

after you've done that simply enter in you're information at the bottom and make sure everything is filled out. after double checking that all information has been correctly filled out click ""send message"" at the bottom of the screen. this will send you're letter to the offices of president obama and ALL of you're state representitives urging them to oppose any and all gun control legislation.
please don't wait to do this if you don't stand up now we all fall. even if you're not a gun owner you should oppose any legislation that removes any civil rights of american citizens. this time it may be gun rights but next time it could be you're right to speak freely or you're right to worship the religion of you're choice or you're right to??? civil rights are ALL sacred and if you

This is just pure and utter madness. If we as a people are this disorganized in a crisis a few ignoramuses are causing, we are ready for complete surrender and utter failure as a country.

 Please do not take advantage of my time. I will make sure any inquiry gets a fair parity return on investment. If you bug me wanting to sell 10 pmags for a SCAR or Harley I am going to make you feel as stupid as your inquiry is. Trust me I will find the time. 

Please use the following below. Look over your gun and find the relevant condition it is in. thanks.

NEW: Not previously sold at retail, in same condition as current factory production. N/A

EXCELLENT: New condition, used but little, no noticeable marring of wood or metal, bluing perfect, (except at muzzle or sharp edges).

VERY GOOD: In perfect working condition, no appreciable wear on working surfaces, no corrosion or pitting, only minor surface dents or scratches.

GOOD: In safe working condition, minor wear on working surfaces, no broken parts, no corrosion or pitting that will interfere with proper functioning.

FAIR: In safe working condition but well worn, perhaps requiring replacement of minor parts or adjustments which should be indicated in advertisement, no rust, but may have corrosion pits which do not render article unsafe or inoperable.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier.
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

................................................................................................

after you've done that simply enter in you're information at the bottom and make sure everything is filled out. after double checking that all information has been correctly filled out click ""send message"" at the bottom of the screen. this will send you're letter to the offices of president obama and ALL of you're state representitives urging them to oppose any and all gun control legislation.
please don't wait to do this if you don't stand up now we all fall. even if you're not a gun owner you should oppose any legislation that removes any civil rights of american citizens. this time it may be gun rights but next time it could be you're right to speak freely or you're right to worship the religion of you're choice or you're right to??? civil rights are ALL sacred and if you

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier.
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier.
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier.
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.

Greetings,
Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.
We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.
If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier.
Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others. I strongly oppose any new gun legislation.
Thank you.
