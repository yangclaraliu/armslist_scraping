Other info: 

No idea on round the actual round count as I am the second owner. I personally put 200 trouble free rounds of Federal 9mm through it. This gun comes with two magazines (one with extension and one without), the original box, paperwork, nylon case, and a Blackhawk #3 pocket holster. The gun is in great condition. It has been cleaned and oiled after every range session. 

Additional info: I have two additional magazines which I will sell for $20 each, one with pinky extension and one without.

Price: $325

Will ship (Y/N): No

Other info: 

This gun was also second hand to me so I don't know the actual round Count. However, it has been well maintained, cleaned and oiled after every range session. The finish on it is good (please refer to pictures). The gun comes with the original box, rail, and keys for the internal lock. 

Upgrades: This gun has the majestic arms speed strip 3.2 kit installed. As such, to disassemble the gun, all you need to do is undo the allen nut on top and pull out the bolt. If you've done your research, you know that the takedown procedure can be tricky, so this kit makes the whole process practically pain free. It also made the trigger crisper and lighter. Finally, it disengaged the magazine safety feature. The kit alone was over $60 so I think this is a fair price. Please visit the majestic arms website for more details: http://majesticarms.com/id10.html

Other info: 

This shotgun started out as a standard Remington 870 Express Magnum, essentially a bird gun. Here is a list of modifications which I used to turn it into my HD shotgun: 

1) Brand new factory Remington 18.5 Rifle Police Barrel $160

2) Tacstar 6 shell side Saddle $30

3) Wilson Combat +2 magazine extension (+ follower) $60 

4) Mesa Tactical 870 AR Stock adapter: $140 

5) AR 15 standard stock (Not sure on make) $15 

6) AR-15 Limbsaver recoil pad $35 

7) Magpul MOE Grip $20 

8) Olive Drab / Black Gunkote paint job done by Valkyrie Arms ($150) 

Total cost in modifications: approximately $610.00 

Note: I figure a used Remington 870 Express Magnum goes for between $200-$300 (according to Gunbroker). So this gun cost me essentially $810 - $910 in the end. Bearing that in mind, I'm asking for $425, so please don't lowball me. I'm including the factory 26 inch ribbed barrel and stock as well. I realize this is a ""tacticool"" modification, so I apologize for offending any traditionalist. However, if this is your cup of tea, your saving a whole lot of money. 


Additional Info: The paint on the bottom of the foreend is wearing a bit because of the racking action (metal on metal), but it's not a huge deal. As you can see from the pics, the paint job is holding very well overall"

Mossberg is joining industry heavyweights in the AR-15 market such as Remington, Ruger, and S&W. Mossberg wants to differentiate themselves inthe market by going with a A2-style (carry handle) receiver instead of the A3-style. Featuring A2 front and rear sights with a carry handle picatinny rail if you want to mount optics. Most tactical .22s have a 16"" barrel, but Mossberg has decided to go with an 18"" barrel for a better sight radius and a more traditional look. Also featuring a full length picatinny rail hand guard and a 10 round magazine. Mossberg is offering this gun in two models, a fixed and an adjustable stock but the other options are the same.

Company Background. (from SCCY website)

COMPANY PROFILE

     In 1998 Joe Roebuck recognized the increasing demand for a safe, simple to use, and affordable firearm due to political climate changes and most states enacting legislation to allow conceal and carry permits. Joe Roebuck has been in the manufacturing industry for 35 years, and chooses to use his talents as a Tool & Die Maker and Mechanical Design Engineer to design the CPX series of firearms. . September 2003, Joe Roebuck founded Skyy Industries, LLC now known as Sccy Industries, LLC to produce a conceal & carry firearm known as the CPX 9mm. The company's first offices and manufacturing facility was located in South Daytona, Florida and as of February 2010 relocated to a new 21,000 sq. ft. facility located in Daytona Beach, Florida, just a half a mile from the famous Daytona 500 speedway.

     Contained in Sccy's new facility are numerous state of the art CNC machining centers of various types using custom tooling and programs designed by Joe Roebuck. The barrel, slide, receiver and all other major metal components are manufactured at the new facility. It was Joe Roebuck's vision that the CPX series firearms could be both cost effective and precisely manufactured to be as good as or even better than other name brand name products, without the high cost to the retail buyer. Sccy is now positioned to continue producing and developing new designs for the CPX series firearms. The CPX series envisioned has been successfully manufactured and sold throughout the United States using its own dealer network. Sccy's success is benchmarked by producing over 45,000 firearms to date. This success continues to grow with the current introduction of the new ""Generation 2"" CPX series. This year, 2011 Sccy will produce CPX‐1 and CPX‐2 ""Generation 2"" pistols and expand its national dealer base to a new all‐time high.

     New customer service procedures are now in place to insure fast and personal service to both retail customers and dealers in need of warranty service. We wish to thank every customer and dealer for the trust and continued loyalty to the Sccy brand and products.

The rifle is lightly used but has been cleaned after every firing.

For those who are unfamiliar, this round is like a Russian equivalent of 223, and has a nickname of being the poison bullet due to its tumbling abilities.  The iz240 is a rifle that  often is easily converted into an ak74 (which is an ak47 in this caliber).

It takes unmodified high capacity ak74 magazines.  The feed ramp mod is not applicable to this caliber.  I have tried it and there are no issues.

Price is 550 but I will listen to offers."

About 4000 rnds through the gun total (estimate based on previous owner report, I personally shot no more than 1600 rnds since purchase). Recently took it to the range to make sure its in good working order, and shoots Very well (I even considered keeping it, but alas, I have others to take its place at my side day-to-day).

Original wood finish and metal, gun has not been refurbished
War Eagle markings on multiple parts of the rifle
DUV 42 marked on receiver, early serial number
Battle worn, no duffel cut, no sporterizing
Early import, only import mark is ""Germany"" on barrel so it doesn't have ""CAI"" or anything else all over it
Complete bolt serials different from complete rifle serials, very typical of a capture rifle in the war when the rifles were in one pile and the bolts were put in another. This gun is not in perfect shape, keep in mind there was a good chance this was used in battle, and as a result the stock has some scratches/dings and the metal has some wear and pitting. This rifle still functions and shoots fine, it just doesn't do any of that in the safe. 
If you are looking for a glossy, perfect stained, unused mauser this is not the one for you. You'd be better off buying one from Mitchell's Mausers that was made after the war and selling for the same price I am asking. If you want a nice collector piece at a lower price than what I have compared to on other sites, then please contact me. Understand that I am no expert, and since these aren't on a shelf at your local Bass Pro with a price tag it's hard to decide a price on something like this. You're welcome to make a cash offer, but don't be offended if I say no. Low ballers will be ignored, I am in no financial bind, and have no problem holding onto it just to sell it for more in a few years. Any questions are welcome, and I will try and answer to the best of my ability. I am in Portland, but travel to Nashville frequently and can meet anywhere in both areas. I also travel across TN from time to time for work, so if feel free to contact me even if you're a good bit away. If it hasn't sold by the time I am in your neck of the woods I can arrange to meet or something. Thanks in advance, have a good day!"

The 2 nickle plated HW7T and HW5T are pretty rare, as well as the 2 HW357 magnums. Here is my add from Gunbroker. Up for auction is my Arminius H. Weihrauch revolver collection, which includes one blued HW7 .22 with a 6 inch barrel, has some rust pitting, but in good over all condition. next is a bled HW3 .22 2 3/4 barrel, the finish on this one is a little flat with some holster wear. Next is a blued HW5 .22 4 in barrel, little wear on the finish but in over all pretty good shape. Next is a nickle plated HW7T .22 6 inch vent/ribbed barrel with a beautiful finish, other than some light scratches. I do have the .22 magnum cylinder which will work in all of the .22 revolvers (Make sure it is safe with your local gunsmith) I have tried it in 2 of the .22's and it worked great. Next is a nickle plated HW5T .32 S&W L/S 4 inch vent/ribbed barrel with 7 shot capacity, finish is beautiful other than some light scratches, both nickle guns have very low round count. Next is a Arminius blued model 17 in the 380 KAL, this is the hammerless gun in the pictures, the finish is worn but still looks to be in good condition. Next is a HW38 with worn finish over the whole gun with rust pitting, and missing front sights. Next is a blued HW3 32 S&W S/L 2 3/4 inch barrel with some holster wear, but other than that in pretty good shape. Next is a blued HW3 32 S&W S/L with a 4 inch barrel, finish is a little flat with some rust, but in pretty good over all shape. Next is a Titan Tiger 38 special with 2 inch barrel, the finish is taken off the frame and polished and has some rust pitting on cylinder and wear on the barrel. Next is another HW38 parts gun (Gun is in peaces) I do believe I have everything to complete this gun, as well as extra grips and a 2 1/2 inch barrel and front sight. Next is a blued HW357 with a 6 inch vent/ribbed barrel, finish is pretty nice except for some wear on the barrel, very low round count. Next is another HW357 blued with a 4 inch vent/ribbed barrel, finish is pretty nice with some wear and minor rust pitting on cylinder, I think this would clean up to be a really nice gun. 13 guns in all, some pretty rare to come by, I will set a pretty low reserve for this collection (Just what I have into them) All guns do lock up nice and shoot great. The only gun I have not fired is the 17, I am not really sure if that is the model number, it says 17 right under the barrel on the ejector. All guns should be checked out by a qualified gunsmith before being fired. I do have the original box for one of the .22's as well as 1 or 2 holsters. I am not a gunsmith and will not be held liable for anything that goes wrong with them. There are no returns so please ask all questions before bidding. All sales are as is and final and have to be shipped to an FFL. I will have to get a zip code to get a estimate on shipping, and if your FFL will not take guns from a private owner there will be a charge from FFL to FFL. I will except US money orders, personal check and PayPal, guns will be shipped as soon as funds are received. Please feel free to ask any questions and I can also send more pictures if needed. I am not to sure what to ask for this collection, so I will start at 1600.00 And this will be a FTF deal with a bill of sale to CO residents. Thanks for looking."

 This gun will shoot 2 3/4 or 3 in shells. Its not a new gun but has been taken care of and not beat up.  I bought it for my daughter to hunt with and the mossberg is to long for her to shoot comfortable. I have 3 chokes tubes (skeet) (full) and (extra full) that goes with the gun also have several slugs and 2 or 3 boxes of #6 shot , i also just installed a new red dot scope and it is sighted in for 75yds with the slugs. This would make a very nice presents for a young hunter so  you can contact me  at REDACTED and i can send you some updated pics with the red dot scope mounted thanks for reading my ad"

I am not a huge African hunter more North American Bears, Moose, ect.  This gun can take the big 5. It is a 1977-78 Remington 700 Safari Custom in 375 H&H Mag. It has a monte carlo stock, rosewood end cap and bottom cap, and Heavy Barrel. It has a Leupold Vari X III 1.5-5 scope with engraved rings.

3. Firearms and the Law: Possession, Ownership, and the Use of Deadly Force

It is easy to shoot, and very accurate up to 10 yards.  I have found that you need hi-velocity ammo, and as long as you buy ammo that is in excess of 1000 fps, the gun works flawlessly.  So, you’ve got to read the box. 

In addition to protection, it is a fun plinking gun….and cheap to shoot.

These are all in excellent condition and great shooters, I just want to narrow down my collection a bit to my concealed carry piece and one more handgun.

I realize the FNP 45 pic isn't there. I didn't realize I only got 3 pics when I wrote this so you can view the FNP at http://www.fracturedperspective.com/guns/fnp.jpg

The price listed above is if you buy the whole collection, which will result in a $100 savings over the piecemeal purchase. Since I'm selling 4 handguns you get a discount of $25 per gun if you buy more than one in a go.

Below is the listing of guns for sale along with their solo purchase price and a quick blurb about the guns.

FN Herstal FNP 45 (45 ACP) w 3x14rnd magazines - $400
Less than 100 rounds through it. Bought it instead of a 1911 and while it's a good shooter it's just not my style. Has a Hogue Handall grip on it.

*SPOKEN FOR*Glock 17: This gun is pretty much sold already..

Taurus Model 66 (357 Mag) 7rnd revolver - $300
I kind of don't want to give this gun up but I don't shoot it. I can't stand a gun sitting in my closet unused and I know I can find it a home where it will get plenty of range time. Smooth, tight action and decent trigger pull. Just over 100 rounds down the barrel.

KelTec P11 w 2x10rnd magazine - $200
Very good pocket pistol. A little holster wear near the tip and a small scratch on the slide. Comes with a Don Hume leather RH IWB holster. Also has a Hogue Handall on it as well as the pinkie extensions on both mags. I have the flat base plates for both magazines.

I've included pictures, questions welcome. None of these guns has been used to fire reloads, only factory ammo in standard ANSI/SAAMI pressures. The shiny patches in the pictures on matte parts is oil; I store my guns in a light coat of oil to prevent oxidation and the foam tends to cause it to collect where it touches.

If you have a good MilSpec/GI 1911 you want to trade I might be interested in a trade involving either a single gun or two guns +cash.

Buy rules: 
Face to face sale - Provide a valid Texas driver's license. I won't travel very far to bring the guns to you and I will not meet anywhere but a public place like a shooting range or gun store. Period. No personal checks.

Shipped orders - I will require the guns to be shipped to an FFL so you'll need to provide me their contact number so that I can acquire a copy of their license prior to shipping. Shipping will be a flat $10 per handgun fee. Payment accepted by PayPal.

Thanks for looking!"
