Local shops are asking 750-850 in the NW area.

At least this way you can check it out face to face and not worry about the condition. Local gun shop will give me 625 with the extra barrel, meaning they plan on selling it for 800 without the extras. I can unload the extras on EBAY and other sites easily and the ammo will sell fast for another 250 bucks.

If you like you can grab 350 in ammo and  400 in extras for 850 for everything. Or just take the basic pistol for 650. Even on a used piece you will spend close to 1400 to get all this but I am offering either way. I know times are a bit tough and would hate to have a dealer make all the money when I can offer it it to a good home for a decent price.

Face to face sale only at this time. Yes you must have a FOID and DL in Illinois. 
Or a local Illinois FFL if you prefer.

Intended to operate reliably under an unbelievably wide variety of climatic conditions, this rifle was developed from the venerable Kalashnikov assault rifle.  There are many different buttstocks, fore ends, and optics that you can put on it, and it shoots all ammunition reliably (basically, you could put a rock in it and it would fire it!).  

The rifle has an integrated rail for a sight/scope mount on the left side of the receiver.  The sight mount comes up the left side and curves over the top of the weapon.  When the sight mount and scope are mounted, the iron sights can still be used.  

Attached to the sight/scope rail is a genuine UTG Sight/Scope Mount with a Quick Detach Lever and both side and top Picatinny rails.  Mounted to the Quick-Detach UTG is a Simmons 6.5 - 20 x 50mm adjustable scope.  With a max power of 20x and an aperture of 50mm, you can see to the moon with this thing!  You can positively identify your target and accurately place your shot with this beast of a scope.

Included in this package are one 8-round and one 24-round magazine, two extra stocks (one ""Club-foot"" and one ""Hunting-style"" stock), and 360 rounds of 150 grain Jacketed Soft Point (JSP) Federal Premium ammunition packed in a .50 cal military ammo can.  This ammo retails for about a dollar a round for a reason - it is some of the best .308 made.

The barrel is machined from ordnance grade, chrome moly, high vanadium steel hardened to Rc 28-32. The barrel is 24"" or 30” long, has 8 grooves, 1-15” right hand twist and features a SAAMI spec chamber which will allow the use of any SAAMI spec ammo. The barrel and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished for long lasting good looks and corrosion protection. The V50SS utilizes the time proven standard, '98 Mauser trigger system which has been modified for use in a Bullpup style rifle. This rifle also features a high efficiency ""shark fin"" muzzle break, machined from solid bar stock and threaded on to the muzzle of the barrel with 1-12 TPI threads. This muzzle break is designed to reduce felt recoil to that of a 12 ga. Shotgun. The muzzle break can be “Tuned” to the barrel by altering the length via the long thread shank. This feature allows the operator to find the “sweet spot” for the break that gives the best accuracy. An M1913 Picatinny scope rail is attached via oversized grade 8 allen screws for easy mounting of optics. The oversized recoil shoulder distributes the recoil over a large surface area affording rock solid mounting to the stock. The bolt has three huge locking surfaces and a 60 degree throw. It features a “primary extraction” cam for positive extraction of the case. The receiver is machined from bar stock SAE 4150 steel and features pressure release vents for BOTH case separation and primer pierce, making this one of the strongest, safest actions available. We have tested these actions and bolts to pressures exceeding 100,000 psi with no evidence of failure. The stock is machined from aircraft aluminum bar stock. This Bullpup style aircraft aluminum tubular stock is made to machine tool tolerances and is completely impervious to climate and temperature. This Bullpup stock allows for a shorter overall length while still retaining a full 30” barrel. The pistol grip is a standard AR-15 type that allows the operator many aftermarket choices. The included M1913 Picatinny scope mount is a heavy duty design and allows for easy mounting of optics.

This can shoot both 44 magnum and 44 special if you or others shooting want a lighter recoiling gun.  The 6.25 inch barrel works well for taming recoil.  This was bought second hand but I've personally only put about 3 boxes of ammo through it and have never carried it.  It's a safe queen.
This is a 629-4.  The -4 indicates its in the 4th generation with a few mods done by factory.  One of the biggest plusses is that this was last Gen to not use a hammer block, but an actual hammer pin.  Big plus!

Pictures are available for all of the pistols listed below. E-mail if you're interested! Thanks!

1. 1914 Erfurt Artillery Luger (9mm luger):
An uncommon and unique pistol from WWI, there were only 22,000 of these ever made (compared to nearly 200,000 from DWM). Pistol is completely intact and functional, but does suffer from some cosmetic issues. The pistol has pitting, mostly fairly light, across approximately 70% of the surface. It does have some heavier pitting along the backstrap of the grip, with the worst along the rear portion of the frame. However, it's still presentable, and perfectly safe to shoot. This is a cosmetic issue only, and the mechanics of the pistol are in excellent condition. Pistol is mostly matching, with only a few minor parts not matching the barrel/frame. These are really cool pistols, and if you've been looking for one to have a good time at the range with, this is a good example to enjoy without worrying about damaging one in mint condition.
Includes a nice current manaufacture Mec-Gar magazine.
Price: $1100 OBO

2. WWII German FN M1922 (aka M1910/22) w/ original holster and 2 magazines (.32 ACP/7.65mm):
One of the main pistols of WWII Nazi Germany, the FN M1922 pistols were widely issued to Army officers and Luftwaffe personnel. This rig is in beautiful condition, having a beautiful original finish, completely intact and original WWII leather Luftwaffe holster, and two original WWII era magazines. The pistol shoots great, and the serial numbers are all fully matching. Finish is about 80-90%. The leather on the holster does show some patina/age, but the leather is still very supple, and the Luftwaffe stamp is clear and easy to see. All in all, a nice, correct, original, and beautiful WWII German pistol rig.
Price: $400 OBO

3. Czech CZ-52 Rig (7.62X25):
These are great shooting pistols which use an inexpensive round. Condition is Very Good to Excellent, and the pistol shoots great. All numbers are matching, with a brand new firing pin. This pistol is ready to go, and includes 2 original magazines and a nice original holster.
Price: $225

4. Ruger Standard (.22LR):
This pistol is in great condition, and shoots even better. It is a basic .22LR pistol, similar to a Mark I but with fixed sights, simple enough for anyone to use. The pistol is in nice original condition, with a neat set of custom exotic wood grips. 
Price: $245

5. Walther Manurhin P1 Rig (9mm Luger)
The Walther P1 is basically a WWII era P38 with an alloy frame, made for the German police in the 1950s. This version was actually assembled in France from German parts and is more uncommon. The condition is Very Good, with only some light holster wear to the original finish. All numbers are matching, and the mechanics are excellent and it works great. Includes original holster and 2 magazines.
Price: $300

6. Astra 600 (9mm Luger)
The Astra 600 pistols were originally made for the German Army in WWII. However, after the first shipment, the supply lines were cut off by the events of D-day in 1944. However, the factory completed the remaining 40,000 pistols throughout 1944/45, and stored them away until they were purchased again by the German police in the 1950s. This example is in Very Good condition, with fully matching numbers, and shoots great! It does have some holster wear and a few small marks on the grips, but is overall a nice historical pistol.

The AR platform has become the most popular rifle platform over the last few years.  This can be attributed to several things:
1.	Versatility.  You can play with it, hunt with it and compete with the same rifle.
2.	Ease of use.  It is simple to maintain and clean.
3.	Manageable recoil.  With compensators the felt recoil can be tuned to almost nothing.
4.	Accuracy.  The 5.56 is a great round for competition.
5.	Accessories.  If you can dream of it, it is probably available for the AR.

This is a great gun, I'm just looking for more of a traditional hunting rifle."

Match grade, free floated barrel. The bolt and its action are the smoothest available, in my opinion.  Padded hard case, chamber lock, roughly 30 rounds of ammo, and a Bore snake are included as part of the package. Much more interested in a simple sale, but am also open to partial cash trades. No offers will go unconsidered. This really is a beautiful and extremely accurate rifle. Tikka garuntees 1 MOA groupings with the proper ammo. In my two trips to the range with her, I was able to achieve sub-MOA from a shooting rest.
While I am much more interested in a simple sale, I am also open to partial trades as well."

Comes with box, manual, three mags, shaped grips(I shaved them to better fit hand) , and a new set of grip panels in case you dont like the way they were shaved. Has less than 300 rounds through it.Its a full size gun 4.5"" barrel and 16 round magazines. This is basically a cz75 for cheaper and is every bit as accurate. Tangfolio is the actual gun maker, a well known Italian gun manufacturer . EAA just imports them into the US. Before 2005 , EAA imported two frame sizes of the witness, the small and large frame. After 2005 they stopped importing the small frame and only imported the large frame for ease of caliber conversion kits. This is the classic small frame which they began importing again in very small quantities due to customer demands for the old small frame . Currently they no longer import them at all so its a rare gun but parts are available since tangfolio still sells the small frame and many other cz75 clones(armscor ar24 etc) are built using small frame tangfolio parts. The desert eagle baby eagle uses tangfolio parts.  The small frame is the same size as the cz75(grip panels interchange) and fits people with small/med hands better since the large frame requires a longer reach to the trigger. Ok, back to the gun , it is in excellent shape(like new) and shoots like a dream. I just ordered a 3rd magazine for it so one mag has not been used at all. I am firm at $355 for this gun. You cant find them and where else can you get a legendary cz75 like steel frame gun for $355? This gun can be carried cocked and locked just like the famous 1911 and many consider it the 1911 of europe. The famous Jeff Cooper said this design(cz75) was the best service 9mm. If you are 1911 lover and want a 9mm this is it. If I wasn't getting my concealed carry I would keep it. Gun alone used sells for $375 or more if you can find one and only comes with 1 mag and are usually in much worse shape. Gun shoots very soft due to grip,super low bore axis and being steel, perfect to teach woman or even children to shoot. This gun can be put on safety with ot without being cocked and also you can even cycle rounds with safety on, a very safe gun to own .You will love this gun once you feel it."
