All Mags are Glock. Also included is the soft laptop case.
Im sure most know but these are very hard to come by and are on back-order with no eta. Took me almost a year to get this while working at a gun store.  These sell on GB all day for over $500 (and Ive seen them go for much higher)  atleast the ones that take Glock mags, since there is a greater demand. The G26 is not included for this price but would make for one heck of a kit if the price or trade is right. It is my primary concealed carry gun, and I have yet to come across another one that groups as good as it does. It has broke many G17 owners hearts in Glock league shoots. Has a mild trigger job and Factory Glock night sights. So as I said it will only go for the right price or trade!"

Our S1H holster component is made for revolvers, and will work with Galco Miami Classic, SSII, and Galco half harness systems. It features a thumb break and will accept a tie down. The S1H holster component is constructed of premium saddle leather and is available in tan or black finish for right- or left-handed shooters.This is a holster only, not a complete system.The modular interchangeable component shoulder systems (originally known as the ""Jackass Rig"") were invented by Galco International in 1970. Today, we continue to offer quality and versatility by developing products that enable you to design the perfect system to suit your needs. For example, you may assemble a two-handgun rig, a half harness system, or add tie downs and cuff case to an existing system. The possibilities are endless."

this is the standard model 36 champion introduced in 1909 (safe with smokeless powder loads). the lack of the model 36 markings suggest manufacture in the 1920's as does the small slim forearm and the rounded pistol grip.

The butt plate shows the IverJohnson Owl. The champion 12 g  models did have a hard kick to them.

if in good shooting condition this shotgun should be safe with modern 2 3/4 inch field loads.

443,http://www.armslist.com/posts/331443,For Sale:  1858 Remington Black Powder 44 cal replica,"East near Deerfield, Madison, Wisconsin",$ 200,"Listed On: Sunday, March 25, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Mint condition  Produced in 1974   Serial number 289.   44 cal.   More photos available.  Research on this gun follows

The 1858 Remington is based on the Remington-Beals patent of 1858 and actually was not produced in the form your gun has until 1862, but the designation remains ""1858 Remington""
It is easily recognized by the presence of a topstrap over the cylinder, no barrel wedge (as in the Colts) and the distinctive streamlines profile of the loading lever under the barrel.


The same model gun manufactured in Italy and sold by Uberti or F.LLI Pietta, is stamped with a variety of markings ‚Äì Italian Proof House
devices, manufacturer's symbols and an encoded date of manufacture. It is usually a combination of heraldry and letters, which need to be decoded. The same is true of flintlock and percussion lock pistols and long rifles manufactured by Uberti, F.LLI Pietta, ArmiSport, Davide Pedersoli, Armi San Paolo SRL (Euroarms), and Palmetto, which comprise the major Italian manufacturers currently in production.

The Italian proof houses in Gardone and Valtrompia have been around for a very long time but as far as reproduction black powder arms are concerned, the dating begins in 1954. Prior to 1954, the year of proof was indicated in full Arabic numerals.

Following is a chart displaying the year of proof symbols used from 1954 to 2003. These are traditionally found within a box next to the individual proof house symbols. From 1954 through 1970 Roman Numerals were used. Roman Numerals and Arabic Numerals were combined in 1971, 1972, and 1973, and Roman Numerals were
used again in 1974. Since 1975 two capital letters have been used exclusively.

As to the placement of proof house symbols, it depends upon the model of gun, and the level of embellishment, the latter often dictating a discrete location on the underside of the barrel or frame on highly engraved examples.

There are two standardized proof house marks. The first is the provisional Gardone proof, consisting of a star surrounded by eight lands and grooves over a coat of arms featuring a hammer and anvil and crossed bayoneted rifles; the second is a star surround by eight lands and grooves over the capital letters PN. All firearms produced in Italy since 1950, regardless of type, receive the first stamping. The second, also instituted in 1950, is the first black powder proof for Gardone and Brescia, and is only used on black powder arms. Thus all black powder arms must bear both proof house symbols.

Finally, there is the manufacturer's mark. This is often confusing unless one is familiar with the manufacturers' insignia. Most use their logo, while some combine their name and logo, or use an abbreviation as their logo. Earlier guns generally bear only their manufacturers' mark, while more recent production has been seen using both an emblem and company name.

Davide Pedersoli, one of Italy's oldest manufacturers has had three logos since 1957. The earliest was a diamond inside a circle. This is rarely seen. This mark was followed by the image of an anvil with PEDERSOLI above it in capital letters and the initials DAP inside the anvil. This again is rarely seen, except on very early models. The company logo, a lowercase dp within an oval, has been used for more than 40 years. This logo is often followed by the DAVIDE PEDERSOLI or PEDERSOLI name in capital letters. In short, there is no mistaking a Pedersoli product!

The metal has no blueing.  The barrel end is pooched out from someone shooting steel shot.  The gun works well though.  I used it as recently as 5 years ago.

639,http://www.armslist.com/posts/331639,For Sale:  Spikes Tactical M4 Upper,"JIA, Jacksonville, Florida",$ 440,"Listed On: Friday, March 9, 2012",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have for sale a Spikes Tactical complete upper receiver. I put it together from all new Spikes Tactical parts. It is a 16 inch M4 profile barrel.  It is ready to bolt to your lower and go shooting. After putting it together I fired 1 box of 20 rds to verify function, and everything worked as expected. 

I like to fully disclose any and all issues prior to meeting to sell, so I will do that now. None of the ‚Äúissues‚Äù effect function at all as it is strictly cosmetic from the parts sitting around and being moved and such.
1)	There is a pin head sized ‚Äúsilver‚Äù dot on the left side of the upper as seen in the picture.
2)	I must have at some point got what looks to be copper color paint on the top edge of the front sight base. 
3)	Since the barrel assembly was stored as a complete assembly with the barrel nut on the barrel. It has slid between the front sight and the barrel extension causing some scratches. These are completely covered by the handguards though and always will be covered no matter if you keep the handguards of go to a rail. You can still see the ST roll mark on the barrel in person, but my camera would not pick it up. 

Due to the cosmetic flaws, I have this upper priced at $50 less than the cheapest I have been able to find online. 

Price is $440 cash


Also have a new in package Spikes detachable carry handle w/ rear sight I can add for $60 (ST sells them for $89.99 + Shipping)"

As I stated in my other post, I'm not out to make a profit on this gun, nor take advantage of anyone in any way shape or form.  I just need to sell a couple of firearms to help me cover some ongoing veterinarian costs and wanted to put up some quality firearms at a more than fair price.  I have sold many firearms on here before, and have had multiple repeat buyers.  I'm sure that if they were able to, they would attest that I stand behind everything gun that I post and my guns are well taken care of.

I'm putting up my Colt Diamondback 2 1/2"" in .38SPL.  This is a very rare Diamondback.  Serial number D12--- makes this 2nd year production gun from 1967.  The gun was originally used as a carry weapon years and years ago.  It has a little bit of holster wear on the left side of the muzzle and cylinder as shown in the photographs.  Gun is easily a 90% gun, and the book value for 90% is 725, then add another 50% for the 2 1/2"" barrel in .38SPL, making it's current market value $1,087.50 to a 95% gun at $1425.00, my price is 900.  This gun might be considered a little higher than 90%, but opinions vary and I'm going to stay on the low side to be fair.   I'll attach a photo of the current bluebook value so you know I'm not telling tales here.  This firearm will be appreciated by the antique, or Colt collector.  Diamondbacks are hard enough to find as it is, and this one is exceedingly rare.
