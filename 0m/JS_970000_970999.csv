All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Choose from a mil-spec stainless steel spring or our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.”"

I am not going to sell it at all, I just wanted to tell all you gougers to go F*** YOURSELVES!!!  To all the good people that frequent this site: Please be patient.  Don't be taken advantage of.  Things are slowly going back to normal.  The panic is dying out now that credit cards are getting maxed out.  Soon the market will be flooded with stuff so people can make their card payments and prices will be lower than before the panic!  They lose! I just happened to get lucky and be in the right place at the right time.  They got 12 cases in this morning and there was only 1 left after I bought mine.  $449 was a bit high, but considering there are people in this 'friendly online community' asking $500 for 400 rounds (F-U!), and $650 for a 880 rd tuna can (F-U!), I was willing to pay it.  Oh, and let's not forget about the guy asking $800 for the XDS that he bought for $500 yesterday.  It's apparent that most of these people are not selling their overpriced items anyway, because I keep seeing the same things re-posted.  C-mon guys, let's try to make ARMSLIST fun again!

Accepts Glock 32 round mags. Comes with Blue Force sight w/ rail, laser, and one 10rd mag.  I realize this is an inflated price tag however this is exactly what I paid for it. I ordered a Mech Tech unit months ago and just recieved it so I don't really need two 9mm carbines. I am not interested in trading for any other rifles as I have plenty. I have one glock 32 round that i can sell for an additional $100 Buyer must be legal to own a firearm and would need to see a Washington ID.  Pick up in Tacoma.

Folds completely in half. The sight rail system is designed for the Kel Tec so that it can fold and lock.  Also comes with a bolt tube cover and nylon carry case. Low round count. You get about 200 or so fps in velocity out of the 9mm with the SUB 2000. + higher stopping power. So with a rifle that you can fit in your backpack, laptop case, and in the front pocket of most suitcases you probably one of the best set ups for a 9mm. Take into account the light weight of 4 lbs and higher accuracy of a rifle this is a great option for a survival pack."

I have had a lot of luck at local big 5 sporting goods in my area. box of 20 runs around 9.99-12.99 per box. This is not the cheapest but a hell of a lot better price than what people are charging on here. Also found steel case ammo for 5.50 per box at other stores. Please help in lowering the prices on here by not buying anything from these ass holes asking a dollar a round. Or that are asking 1k for a complete lower or the 600 dollar striped lower. Email me and I can send you links to complete uppers for 400-600 dollar range. Educate yourself, and you will know nothing is going to happen to or Ar15 riffles. They are not going to stop making 5.56 or .223 ammo. The stores are getting some in and a little more time will have it in stock. Best thing all of us can do is not give any of the guys here any more money. Almost forgot mags are back in stock in many places. You do not need to spend 30+ dollars per mag they are only worth 10-15 each.

He is the only person to win 196 archery field tournaments in succession. 

The Howard Hill Company of Hamilton, Montana, is and has been offering Hill-style longbows for many years. The particular model which I have for sale was their top-of-the-line Big Five model. The Big Five,
according to the literature and information given by Mrs. Betty Ekin, friend of Howard Hill and, along with son Craig, operator of the Howard Hill Archery Company, was patterned after the famous “Sweetheart” Hill's favorite bow.  The construction of ths bow is constructed of laminated bamboo per Hill’s design. Hill reportedly took a trip to Japan in 1960 in order to find and ship home a specific species of bamboo he found most suitable for his needs, and I understand that the Hill Company still uses this species in the
bow’s construction to date. The belly and face of the Big Five bow are both backed by glass.
The bow that I am offering was made in 1974 (one year before Mr. Hill passed away) and is set up for 70 lbs. at a 29"" draw length. The bow itself is 70 inches long. Because it was custom made for me it sports...""Custom made for My Name"". This is painted on and could be easily removed. I used the bow to hunt whitetail for a few years so there are some superficial scratches (nothing deep). I would recommend having a bowyer make a new string as the one I have is frayed in places.

With the exception of the TulAmmo which is steel cased, the rest of the ammo is brass-cased and reloadable.  5.56 x 45mm ammo is milspec ammo usable in almost all AR-15 rifles.  The basic rule is that if your rifle is marked ""5.56"" then you can shoot 5.56 or .223 Remington.  If your rifle is marked "".223 Remington"", then it is generally advised that you only use .223 ammo.

I am selling a BRAND NEW Sig Sauer 556 R. It has never been fired and comes brand new in box. I am also throwing in 6 BRAND NEW 30 round Magazines and 250 Rounds of BRASS Hornady 7.62 x 39 ammo.

I am asking $2750.00 for the whole package. NO TRADES, please do not ask me if I want to trade because the answer is NO. Serious inquiries only. Please call or text REDACTED if serious and ready to do business. Do not email or message me because I do not check my E-mail or this website much. Thanks!"

I am located in the South Carolina Upstate, looking for FTF for this deal because shipping would be a logistical and cost nightmare. After the picture I will post a break down in detail of everything that comes with the rifle and the pricing I have used to reach the end result. My goal was to keep it quite a bit lower than what current market is going for because I do not agree with all the price gouging that has been going on as of late.  I am not looking to split this up, as some of the items I have discounted quite a bit from current market value (ammunition mainly) when being bought together. The rifle in question is my safe queen, a Daniel Defense M4 V5 with exactly 115 rounds through it. It comes with a gunsmith installed Magpul ASAP plate and Magpul MS3 sling which is shown attached in the picture. It was hard to decide to let this one go, but I have to be honest with myself and admit that for the next few years in college it will just be sitting in the safe, might as well pass it on to someone who can get some use out of it :).
