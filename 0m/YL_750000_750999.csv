Call/text REDACTED ( Jimmy )
Thanks! 

Here, more detail about the gun, which made this gun is ultimate CCW gun:
P7. I think they are probably the best CCW around:

1. Squeeze cocking. IMHO the safest gun for daily carry. The gun goes from perfectly safe to perfectly deadly in a split second. If you drop it you may have a heart attack because it might get scratched but you can rest assured it won't go off. This gun is incredibly fast.

2. Trigger pull. Thanks to the squeeze cocking system the gun is safely equipped with an excellent single action trigger pull. I've had die-hard partisans of every type of gun praise my P7's trigger.

3. Compact. Although it has full-size controls (no pinky hang), the gun is sized like a compact approaching a subcompact. It is much thinner than almost any handgun.(1.1-1.2 inches).

4. Full-size barrel. Despite this gun's compact size it has a full 4-inch barrel.

5. Fixed-barrel. This gun lacks the tilting barrel assembly of most other full-sized guns. This lends the gun exceptional accuracy. In combination with the aforementioned trigger, this barrel makes the P7 ultra-accurate.

6. Low recoil. This is debatable. I have always felt that this has the least recoil of any 9mm. Some disagree, most don't. This is likely result of the guns low bore/axis and gas system (although some say the gas system should have no effect).

7. Tough! This gun is CNC milled from a solid steel forging. The gun is so solid it could be used as a nasty set of brass knuckles in a pinch. Without picking one up it is hard to imagine how solid this little gun feels. When I had mine hardchromed the smith complained endlessly about how hard the P7 was to machine.

8. Excellent sight radius. Although the gun is short, HK maximized the sight radius by pushing the sights as far apart as practically possible.

9. Oddball manual of arms confuses bad guys and know it all buddies. There are many accounts of cops losing their P7's to bad guys who were, in turn, unable to figure out the squeeze cocker. On the lighter side, a know it all at a local gunshop had just explained to all of his bad experiences with the P7 when I handed it to him only to watch him fumble around unable to cock it! Hilarious.

10. Chamber fluting allows the gun to function even if the extractor is broken. This feature really makes you think when you are trying to determine which gun you want to bet you life on (no offense, but this a much more serious advantage than being able to freeze the gun in a bucket of ice or whatever).

11. Easily childproofed. The P7's striker can be removed without tools (and without any other disassembly of the gun). The striker can be re-inserted into the gun in roughly 1 second. This could be a major consideration to those of us with small children and stupid friends.

12. Ambidextrous. With the exception of the slide catch and take down buttons, every model of the P7 is completely ambidextrous.

13. Ultra-fast magazine release. This has to be experienced to be understood. Rambo types complained about the PSP  lack of rapid magazine release. HK, Germans that they are, decided to give them what they wanted a magazine that ejects so fast and powerfully that they could be used as back-up projectiles in an emergency.

14. Ultra fast slide release. Simply squeeze the handle and the slide will be released.

15. 110 degree grip angle gives the gun natural pointability. 110 degree grip angle makes the gun point just like you finger.

16. Low profile slide. The P7 PSP is low profile slide means that there is very little recoiling mass relative to the frame. This, along with the above mentioned 110-degree grip angle makes reacquiring targets a breeze with the P7."

The magazines fit any weapon that can used standard USGI magazines.

The coating exceeds MIL-SPEC salt spray test requirements.

Floorplate is reinforced.

Followers are latest-generation anti-tilt followers with a self-lubricating polymer.

Followers are white for a reason - The Israeli method of fighting involves a chamber check any time the weapon runs dry, there is a malfunction, or the shooter finishes engaging a target - the shooter glances at the ejection port to verify the status of the weapon. This prevents the shooter from moving from one engagement to the next without realizing the rifle is jammed or empty. It also allows the shooter to assess a malfunction to determine the best way to clear it. 




Special-ops troops in Israel began painting their followers white in order to be able to more easily see identify the status of the weapon in low light, and to mer easily tell if they were observing a cartridge or the follower in low light.

You don't see the white follower when the mag is loaded, so it does not matter what color it is until you need to see it through the ejection port, and then white is a big advantage.




I have personally used these magazines for a couple of years with great results. If you have any specific questions, I will be glad to answer them.


I have x5 cases (100 per case)
Keeping these for a rainy day but time to pass it on to others that may need them

These are heavy-gauge steel magazines built for the Tavor and also M16 rifles for use by the IDF.

The magazines fit any weapon that can used standard USGI magazines.

The coating exceeds MIL-SPEC salt spray test requirements.

Floorplate is reinforced.

Followers are latest-generation anti-tilt followers with a self-lubricating polymer.

Followers are white for a reason - The Israeli method of fighting involves a chamber check any time the weapon runs dry, there is a malfunction, or the shooter finishes engaging a target - the shooter glances at the ejection port to verify the status of the weapon. This prevents the shooter from moving from one engagement to the next without realizing the rifle is jammed or empty. It also allows the shooter to assess a malfunction to determine the best way to clear it. 




Special-ops troops in Israel began painting their followers white in order to be able to more easily see identify the status of the weapon in low light, and to mer easily tell if they were observing a cartridge or the follower in low light.

You don't see the white follower when the mag is loaded, so it does not matter what color it is until you need to see it through the ejection port, and then white is a big advantage.




I have personally used these magazines for a couple of years with great results. If you have any specific questions, I will be glad to answer them.

The carbine is assembled but never used and the pistol has been used. The pistol has had the feed ramp polished and feeds HP's very well. Also added some grip tape strips to the pistol for easier racking of the slide(better grip). These should be very reliable shooters and I find them to be accurate guns ( I have the 9mm carbine and love it).  Both have rails for other optics.These of course have the High Point (Beemiller of Ohio) lifetime warranty, if it breaks you get it fixed or replaced free. So you get 2 guns for very little money with 4 mags that fit either, a preppers dream with lots of knockdown power, it is after all a .45 caliber. FTF sale with ID, CCW or FOID preferred. Cash sale preffered but I am looking for a nice SKS (no yugos) or a Smith, Taurus, or Rossi stainless .357 4 inch or better. Could do partial trade up or down.

Followers are white for a reason - The Israeli method of fighting involves a chamber check any time the weapon runs dry, there is a malfunction, or the shooter finishes engaging a target - the shooter glances at the ejection port to verify the status of the weapon. This prevents the shooter from moving from one engagement to the next without realizing the rifle is jammed or empty. It also allows the shooter to assess a malfunction to determine the best way to clear it. 

Special-ops troops in Israel began painting their followers white in order to be able to more easily see identify the status of the weapon in low light, and to mer easily tell if they were observing a cartridge or the follower in low light.

This is a gun that my late father let to my mother and she would like to get rid of it to cover expenses and final costs. 
It took me a long time to search out exactly what this is. Official model is an R6550GC. Apparently this is one of five hundred factory Colts that came from the Colt Custom Shop in a factory camo called ""Z-Coat"". There is a Z on the front of the magwell that confirms this. I'm not exactly clear on the year, but it is definitely a pre-ban gun, and to the best of my knowledge is a ""green-tag"" gun, but I can not exactly confirm that. 
It's a 20"" Government with a serial number in the 700 range. This gun has been carried arond a little bit and has been shot, but the amount is unknown, if I were to guess I would say about 1000 rounds as it was purchased new in the 80s. This isn't a safe queen by any means, but it is in perfect functional condition. 
Please let me know if you have any questions, includes the aluminum pre-ban mag shown. And shipping is a fixed $20 for packaging it up and ground. Will shift expedited if asked. Payment ONLY in USPS Money Order. Available to ship a day after the auction ends 
Thanks for looking!

You have to wonder what was behind the thinking here. This is a Winchester Model 55 single-shot rifle. Chambered for the .22 Long Rifle, it's an ""automatic single-shot""...that is to say that after cocking, a single cartridge is hand loaded through the top port and upon firing the empty case is ejected through the bottom port and the action is recocked. When another shell is pushed down through the gate for loading, the safety automatically resets. The barrel measures 21-3/4"" in length and is fitted with iron sights. The walnut stock is in very good shape, free of cracks or chips, and never been sanded or refinished.  The mechanics are in good working order and the bore is excellent. These were made in somewhat limited numbers between 1958-1961...a strange concept that was probably doomed from the start...but an interesting and collectible Winchester rifle.

The action is of unknown manufacture, (the crest has been polished off at some point in it's history) but the GEW 98 is still clearly marked on the left side of receiver. The bolt handle has been altered for scope mounting but the receiver  has not been drilled and tapped for scope base. Nor does it have a low scope safety. The ejector has been adapted from a Jap 7.7 because the extra length was needed to eject case before it got back under the rear bridge where it would occasionally fall into the action because of hitting the side of the rear bridge.

This rifle does not reliably feed HP or SWC type bullets but is reasonably consistent with RN cast and FMJ bullets. Consistent operation of the action is necessary for any degree of reliability.

It is a great deal of fun to shoot with virtually no recoil and very mild report. It will whack my 100 yard gong every time with a surprising amount of authority. Plus, using cast bullets, it is very cheap to shoot.

I am selling this because I need to finance another project and it has had it's ""day in the sun"" so to speak. NO magazine since I want to keep them for my 45ACP.

But, .... there are some of you on here telling others to sit this one out, and the NRA will come to the rescue. Things will return to normal, and the anti-gunners will lose again. I used to have this fantasy where Obama would be defeated, but too many decided to sit on thier tuff and sit this election out. To those who did so, I say STFU as this mess is partly on your shoulders. To those who say things will return to normal, good luck with your fantasy. Our wonderful constitution doesn't protect you right to own high capacity magazines OR any ammo, period. There are rumors that Obama may use his influence to convince the BATF to classify semi-auto weapons the same as a suppressor or full auto weapon. Also, note that the transfer fee or transfer tax of $200 has been around since 1926. What if you wake up tomorrow to hear that the fee has been raised to $1,000 and your precious Ruger Mini 14 Ranch rifle you enjoy for ground hog hunting now needs to be turned in while you go through a 4 month background check, and the BATF processes your check for $1,000? You don't think so? Think again. Think really hard about what is reality and what the POTUS can actually do. Yes, the NRA can fight back, and we can resist, but stop fooling yourself that the Obama Ameritopia won't be pursued at full force. Diane Franstein (D) California has a gun ban proposal ready for the next session of Congress. Yes, paying out $3,000 for an AR15, 20 PMAGS, and 1,000 rounds of ammo is ridiculous, but so is the nay-sayers toughting there is no threat. I say go ahead and spend your useless fiat paper to stock up on something to protect yourself, your family, and your freedom before it's too late. I say the odds for legislation being successful for magazine confiscation and restrictions happening are VERY high. The odds for reclassification of ""assault"" weapons or military style guns is VERY high. Lsatly, I believe that the odds of restricting the amount or types of ammo is VERY high along with high taxes and registration with mircoprinting becoming your new inconvenience.

This pistol has an all black finish with a Red Star near the muzzle on both sides of the pistol and it comes with two 16 round mags. It has glow in the dark sights, not Tritium. There is a Soviet hammer and sickle laser engraved on the right hand side of the frame above the grip. The trigger pull appears to be similar to the original Cold War era hefty East Bloc trigger pull. The rollmarks are in Cyrillic script and state “ Model 75 Cal. 9 Para” and “Manufactured in Czechoslovakia” in Russian. The serial number is preceded by CCCP, which is Russian for USSR. This is a Cold War commemorative and, as such, it is important to remember that the Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia) was a member of the Warsaw Pact."

This is my 3rd build and by far my favorite. It is everything I had hoped for it to be and really didnt spare much money getting everything I wanted together. It shoots flawless. The XTC comp reduces any recoil it had and eliminated it. I seriously love this thing and hope I dont end up selling or trading. Everything is like new, new or atleast 2 months old..

The rifle has one tiny imperfection from the brass ejecting and that is all, I have sent about 100rds down range. I have the original owners manual etc I also have about all the boxes for all the add ons

I have priced my rifle reasonably considering the situation we are in, Its the best bang for buck expecially compared to the M&P Sports for $2,000

Century Arms Inc. of Georgia, Vermont is well known as an importer of surplus military bolt action rifles and service pistols. They are always studying the American collector, trying to determine what will sell in niche marketing. Century decided to build a Galil replica using a U.S. manufactured and outsourced receiver, surplus IMI parts and, where necessary, U.S. made parts to allow it to become ATF 922r compliant.

The result is the Golani Sporter, probably a reference to the original’s use in the Golan Heights. While the molded plastic fore end resembles in outline the original “AR” version, it differs in minor detail and offers cooling vents below the barrel. The butt stock appears to be IMI original, as is the top action cover and probably the bolt, carrier, bolt internals, gas tube and sights. The trigger group is manufactured by the American firm TAPCO, known for its huge variety of AR15 components, and offers a smooth travel of over 1/3” before firing, with some notable backlash felt in your finger on recoil. The pull weight is a very heavy 6.5 pounds. Century specified a 1:9” twist barrel, to better allow their rifle to accurately shoot either the older 55 grain or the newer 62 grain bullets used by the U.S. military, while not really being optimal for either.

The meaning of ""Ku"" has long been a subject of speculation, with most experts concluding that these were a late war Luftwaffe contract, that was assembled with substandard parts, hence the use of the ""Ku"" or ""Kummerrer"" markings behind the serial number, indicating leftover or mis-sized parts. While others have theorized that these were assembled by the Krieghoff factory using left over Mauser parts. In either case there were only approximately 5000 total produced making these fairly scarce.
 Pistol has a serial numbered barrel with 2 serial numbers, first one is punched out with O's, second does not match the rest of the gun, only other part that is mis matched is the take down leaver, it is marked 41 instead of 40, the mis matched parts fit the senerio for this gun as they were made out of left over parts. i have better pics for interested partys
