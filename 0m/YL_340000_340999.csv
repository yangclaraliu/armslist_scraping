I have a Norinco SKS 7.62x39 type 56 military grade rifle. For those that do not know there are crap load of SKS’s out there – the most sought after are 

1) Russian 

2) Norinco type 56 

3) Norinco type M (uses Ak47 mags) – the rest are pretty much crap. 

My Norinco type 56 is in great shape has scope mount, Truglo red dot, bayonet, sling, and matching numbers – not a parted out or Frankenstein gun!!!

This gun shoots great – I am knocking out bowling pins at 60 and 75 yards out, add a better red dot or scope you would knocking them out at 100 and 150 yards. I have used Tapco 20 round and steel 30 mags in gun – all functioned flawlessly. I have two other Norinco type 56’s so no extra mags or stripper clips going with gun or selling. 

My price is $365.00 firm. 

I am open trades for Polish Tantal AK-74 stuff so I am looking for AK-74 ammo (5.45x39) and Mags. I just purchased two of them, not looking for any other trades

  I purchased this pistol new in 2006 and have been the only person to use the pistol since then.  I've put about 500-750 rounds through it.  Numerous crows and assorted varmints have met their end by this gun.

  The gun has been stored in my basement in a gun safe and receives a thorough cleaning after each use or each month, whichever comes first.

  This pistol looks and shoots great.  It features a fully adjustable rear sight and a fixed fiber optic (green insert) front sight.  Heavy, 6"" fluted, and crowned bull barrel.  With good ammo and a steady hand, this pistol will group quarter inch sized clovers at 15-20'.  Recoil is negligible due to the heavy barrel.

  The metal surfaces are stainless steel or powder coated black.  The grip and lower frame are aluminum and rubber.  Some of the powder coating inside the slab-side slide has come off over the years, but externally, the gun looks fine.  Very pretty in fact.  It also has a picatinny rail for attaching optics for more precise aiming.

  Pistol comes with owners manual, case, cable lock, and two 10 round magazines.

  Im selling this pistol to fund the purchase of a new rifle.  Otherwise, I'd never part with it. 

  I'll accept cash (preferably) or money order.  

  Purchaser will be required to provide proof of identity and complete a private bill of sale, which each of us gets a copy of.

  I'll provide my phone number and meeting location after you make contact with me.

  Thanks for your consideration."

Price is $425.00 firm. 

This gun is a nail driver – The lowest recoil I even felt on any AK – with red dot I was hitting bowling pins at 75 and 100 yards – YES THAT IS RIGHT BALLS ON ACCURATE!!!!! My only complaint about this AK is 10 round mags – yes it only takes single stack 10 round mags. It will take the steel 10 round single stacks for WASR 10, at the range I ran in to a guy with one of the CLINTON Gun Ban restricted AK’s his 10 steel worked in my PAP and my PAP mags worked in his AK – JUST FYI -  

On YOUTUBE there are several videos of people converting these AK’s to accept 30 round mags – I don’t know if would do it but it only takes a Dremel, steady hand, and some extra time - and it is NOT Illegal to convert this AK to accept 30 round mags, because Ohio allows mags up 30 rounds on rifles and pistols – however if you took this weapon state that is 10 round restricted mags you would in trouble…. 

For those who don’t know how to add here is the break down – 

AK at Vance’s $379.99 + $25.58 Sales Tax = $405.57

Simmons Red Dot Vance’s $49.00 + 3.37 Sales Tax = $53.36

Westland Mall Gun Show AK Sling $7.00

Recoil Buffer from aimsurplus.com $10.00

It is the basic black all steel Kimber with a nice looking set of custom laser grips.  It is equivalent to, and I think better looking than, the Kimber Custom Crimson Carry model except this one has a steel frame instead of aluminum.

I added the J&J base pads (purchased from Kimber) to the two Kimber 7-rnd magazines.

This gun has a great trigger pull.  It's not the lightest I've experienced, but it breaks like glass with no creep or drag.  You won't be disappointed when you pull the trigger.

My price isn't cheap, but the gun is nice, its here and can be yours with minimal hassle and no tax.

It is also supposed to eliminate copper fouling. According to Hodgdon's load data, it produces among the most impressive velocities for .223/5.56 and .308/7.62. From Hodgdon's website:
   ""Introduced in January 2012, this versatile spherical rifle propellant incorporates in its formula CFE, Copper Fouling Eraser. This ingredient, originally used in military propellant, greatly deters copper fouling. It contributes to longer periods of top accuracy with less barrel cleaning time. Being a spherical powder, metering is superbly accurate. CFE 223 yields top velocities in many cartridges such as the 204 Ruger, 223 Remington/5.56mm NATO, 22-250 Remington and the 308 Winchester/7.62mm NATO, plus many, many more. Match, Varmint and AR shooters will love this one!""

Bigger and better quality pics in my album!

I have a Toyota Corolla LE I am looking to sell. Like the subject says it has 162,042 miles as of this moment. I am using this for work purposes as we speak so the exact mileage will be determined on the date that you check the car out. I own this vehicle outright and it has a clear title. 

I checked it out on Blue Book and it is booking at $5,119 in GOOD condition. You will see in the picture below that with my inputs that is what condition blue book claims it to be and I cannot argue otherwise. My asking price is $4,500.



I have all the maintenance paperwork 35k miles to 98k. I am the second owner and purchased it off a friends grandmother. This is really a great vehicle in excellent shape save for a few issues which I will enclose. 

I will start off with the defects first. The check indicator light is on. It was taken to AutoZone by my friend a while back, they claimed a sensor was bad and reset the light. Now it is back, but I have noticed nothing adverse in regards to this and a quick trip back can get it reset. On the driver side on the roof fabric right above the door is a grease stain. This is from my hat getting in and out of the car after work. On the driver side rear door just above the wheel well is a slight amount of rust. The middle console is wood grain interior. I have all the pieces but one is not connected and another wont stay shut, a quick rig will set this all straight. Lastly, I was driving the interstate the other day and what I am guessing was a rock hit my windshield. It started out as a small crack but as the weather was cold and pre-heating my car caused for the crack to go the length of the windshield. THESE DEFECTS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR IN MY BLUE BOOK VALUE RESEARCH.The defects are shown below.








The vehicle functions without any issue and is great on gas 30+ mpg. All tires match and still have plenty of tread left. Below are the rest of the pictures I have taken.











It should be noted that this is an automatic transmission vehicle. This would make a great work car or everyday driver. This is also an ideal vehicle for your first time driver.

I am looking to get $4,500 cash for this car. I would be willing to take $4,000 cash + a handgun.

In a perfect world I would like to trade this car for a car of lesser value but one that is reliable to get me to and from work. Example would be your car worth $2,500 + the difference in cash. I am also really looking to get a handgun in this deal as well. So that would be taken out of my overall price. 


WOULD LOVE TO TRADE FOR CAR +CASH AND A HANDGUN.


If you have any questions feel free to call or text me at REDACTED.

I am located in Elkhart and would like to keep all deals in this area. Obviously, I wont ship this vehicle. Payment can be in cash or certified check. IF you throw in a handgun in the deal I will show my pink and whatever else you need. I am very motivated but cash price is fairly firm, though, all things in life are negotiable.


Feel free to come check it out and test drive at your convenience.

Thanks!!"

I'm guessing it's about 5 years old.  Some paint is missing from the top of the rt-side grip where Hoppes cleaning solution was slopped onto it during cleanup. There is a very slight 'idiot scratch' from the where the slide stop pin scratched the frame upon re-assembly.

The Night sites glow and the laser works well.  I've just put in a new Kimber 22lb recoil spring as I'm unsure of how long ago it was replaced last.  I will include another new one for the future.  (Kimber suggests replacing these springs every 800 rounds, but they like to sell springs.  If you keep the gun cleaned up between uses, there is no reason to replace the spring nearly that often.)

You can tell this gun was built up in Kimber's Custom shop;  It shoots like a dream.

If you see this posting, the gun is available.  I'm not interested in trades, thanks."

The union of advanced design, quality materials and proper construction makes Kahr the smallest, thinnest, most reliable full power compact pistol. A value that can't be matched.

Reliability. Unless the gun is 100% reliable, all else is meaningless. Kahr pistols have proven their reliability in testing by Federal, State and local agencies.

 Size. Ergonomically, the Kahr compact pistol excels. The gun is easy to shoot well, and comfortable to carry for extended periods due to its thin profile.

Power. Despite their diminutive size, Kahr pistols deliver full size ballistic performance.

So, when it comes to protecting your life, choose the value gun. Choose the gun stamped KAHR.

Has flip up rear site, ruger scope rings, 5 and 20 rd magazine, and Simmons 3-9x32 scope. I bought it from a 73 year old guy who bought it brand new and put 30 rounds thru it. It does have some dings in the stock from sitting in his safe. I bought the 20 round mag and put 75 rounds thru it. He doesnt know how it happened nut it looks like the handguard has slightly melted near the end. He only had the 5 round mag so I know it didnt get so hot to melt it. You can also tell by the gun. 
I also got around 1600 rounds of ammo to go with it. Most is ComBlock ammo, he doesnt remember what country, some German and some Wolf. Will sell the gun without the ammo but not the ammo without the gun.

I've got all the stuff it came with including all the backstraps, box, speedloader etc. Really looking to trade this plus cash for your colt or Kimber, full size (5 in. barrel), .45, preferably Stainless, but blued is okay if its nice. I can email/text pictures if you are interested."

This handgun is in Like New Condition, Includes box and paperwork.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol. It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

Flow-through vents on the fore-end reduce weight and help cool the barrel during long strings of fire and a Pachmayr® Decelerator® pad helps soak up recoil.

I built the lower receiver of the gun from scratch. The upper i purchased as an assembly then modified. It is my 8th build job and I have another very similar to it. It has a small scratch on the buttstock retaining nut where the wrench slipped off while tightening. Other than that it is all brand new parts. I have never fired this rifle. I do have another rifle almost identical with the same upper and have had great luck with it. 

NOTE: It is the low profile upper so there is NO dust cover or forward assist.

Total price for just the gun w/iron sights (no scope) and 1 30rd mag: $775 

With exception to the Upper assembly and scope I purchased everything from Hoover Tactical. I purchased the Upper assembly from DPMS then modified it with parts from Hoover Tactical. The scope was from Cabela's.

The .223 WSSM was introduced in 2003 by the Browning Arms Company, Winchester Ammunition, and Winchester Repeating Arms Company. It is a shortened .300 WSM (Winchester Short Magnum) case necked down to accept a .224 caliber bullet. The .223 designation is a reference to the popular .223 Remington. It is currently the fastest production .22 caliber round in the world with muzzle velocities as high as 4,600 feet per second (1,402 meters per second).  Also have 15 boxes of shells available at $15 a box.

When extreme long-range accuracy is required, reach for the heavyweight Stealth II varmint rifle. The non-glare, matte finished Bell and Carlson™ composite stock features a checkered pistol grip, Pachmayr® Decelerator® recoil pad and one-piece aluminum pillar block bedding for even greater accuracy. An additional front swivel stud for mounting both a sling and bipod is installed on the wide fore-end. A 26"" heavy profile target barrel and one-piece alloy floorplate and trigger guard help to add mass and rigidity. The blade-type ejector allows you to precisely control ejection force, making fired brass recovery a snap. The Stealth II is available in all three WSSM calibers, plus 22-250 Rem. and 308 Win., and sets a new performance standard for demanding riflemen everywhere."

528,http://www.armslist.com/posts/340528,For Sale:  Baikal 223 / 12 G combo. Model IZH 94,"North of Deerfield, Madison, Wisconsin",$ 425,"Listed On: Sunday, March 18, 2012",Shotguns,Savage Arms                                                                                ,no type,no type,Shotgun,"1. The gun came with 3 screw in choke tubes for the shotgun barrel (F, M and IC). A wrench is provided. 

2. The metal finish is world class.The blueing is the best I have seen on a Baikal so far. In fact, the blueing is at least as good as I have seen on any firearm. 

3. Upon handling ,everything seems to be very solid (even more solid than the IZH-27 O/U shotgun). As if the whole thing is made of one block of steel. 

4. The shotgun opens smoothly. It closes nice and tight. Metal to metal fit is perfect. 

5. The utilitarian stock is made of walnut. Just like the IZH-27 (SPR 310), it is not artistically shaped. The wood finish is similar to the IZH-27 and the recoil pad is identical. However the checkering is better than the IZH-27's. 

6. There is a regulating system to allow the two barrels point of impact to coincide. The barrel lenght is 600mm (23.5 ""). 

7. The sights are adjustable. A scope rail and sling swivels are standard equipment. 



Except for extremely open terrain where I prefer both partners of a two-man team to use a rifle, when calling with a partner I like to have one guy using a shotgun (usually the person doing the calling) and the designated shooter ready with a rifle. A shotgun really shines for getting those ""low-flyers"" that seem to come busting through your stand with little warning, which you get a lot of when you hunt heavy cover.
I became interested in a combo gun when I started finding myself hunting alone in heavy cover more often and getting better at calling coyotes in closer to my position (which I challenge myself to do before shooting). I had been shooting shotguns at predators for most of the 2001 season before investigating the combo gun option. It seemed like I always had a rifle when I would've done better with a shotgun, and when I had the shotgun, it seemed like Id always get a couple of easy-takers that were just outside the shotgun range. Since I usually call alone, I thought having both a rifle and a shotgun would be great, but having to manage two separate firearms was out of the question. Obviously a combo gun would be quite the ticket and I did some serious consideration.

There wasn't a lot of real-world information available about using combo guns for predator calling, so I felt like I was taking a bit of a ""leap"" when I finally decided to order the IZH-94 sight-unseen. There are several different Rifle/Shotgun Combo guns available to sportsmen made by other manufacturers such as Crossfire, Savage, Tikka and others with prices ranging from $500 to $1700. In making my decision to place the order I figured that 90% of the coyotes I see are within 100 yards... even if it shot a 3"" group, worst case, that would still be Coyote-Accurate. I was also able to justify my purchase as a ""back-up"" or ""loaner"" gun for guests that may not have a suitable firearm to use.

A limitation of the single-shot action is that a quick follow-up shot can be difficult to execute quickly. I decided to go with a larger caliber of rifle for more of a one shot, knockdown punch. Particularly in heavy cover, I find the .223 to be somewhat lacking and prefer something in the .243Win range, and so I chose the 6.5X55 Swede caliber, long renowned for its flat shooting and accuracy (and because it was on sale!) The Combo gun was ordered from CDNN Investments, and it was shipped to my Local FFL the next day."

The reports that I have received from NEF owners have generally been positive. Most rifle buyers seem to feel that they received good value for their money.

Handi-Rifles generally deliver adequate accuracy for a hunting rifle of their caliber.  The good trigger definitely aids accurate shooting, and single shot rifles are particularly convenient for use at a rifle range, where regulations often require that all rifles be single loaded.

Seller's Description:

NO RESERVE!! An exceptional example and the last of a small collection I received. This is a Harrington & Richardson ""U.S.R.A. Model"" single-shot .22 Target pistol, considered by many to be one of the most accurate handguns of all time! It features a break-open action with 10-inch barrel, adjustable sights, one-piece walnut target grips, automatic ejection, and an extremely crisp/creep-free trigger. The barrels were so precisely/smoothly rifled that they required no lapping and have zero free-bore. These guns were used to set National and World Records in their day. The USRA Model was made in limited quantities between 1929-1941 with a total production estimated at around 3300 guns. This is a fairly early production gun with early features. It has the ""key hole"" barrel, curved/grooved trigger, early round automatic ejector, knurled barrel latch and small hammer. The stock screw is located in the back strap. The original blue finish rates very nearly 100% with no rust or pitting. The trigger, hammer and latch are case colored with the sides polished in the white. The grips are excellent, with crisp checkering, and an intriguing small cartouche which is repeated inside on the grip frame. The bore is excellent...bright and sharp. The mechanics are in perfect working order as well. The serial number is 615 and is properly matching on frame, barrel and hinge. Comes with the original box which is numbered to the gun (box does show wear and some repairs). Also included are the extremely rare factory test target and wooden dowel cleaning rod. The test target is numbered to the gun and shows an extremely tight 25-yard group. This is an exceptionally fine example and rarely seen with the box and extras. The ""Blue Book of Gun Values"" lists the USRA Model at $1500.00 in 95% condition...without extras. It shows ""N/A"" for a gun in this condition...which I believe indicates None Available. It's a scarce one folks!

The PSL was bought new by me and has had 20 or 30 rounds for it.  It has a Romanian PSO type scope, 1 ten round magazine, and a muzzle device which isn't welded on like some of the other PSLs.  When I took it out it shot quite well and I was pretty darn accurate with the iron sights, especially for me mainly being a pistol guy.  I think I would shoot it a ton more of x54r had better availability locally.  I would prefer a face to face trade in state, but would transfer for the right rifle.

The rifle includes one mag, the romanian psop scope, scope bag, and if required a soft case.

This is one of the most beautiful pocket pistols ever made. This gun was purchased new by current owner in 1991. These guns were discontinued in 1994. While the alloy framed Pocketlite models have been reintroduced recently, that is not the case for these beautiful all nickel steel framed models. They remain very hard to come by. Only rarely do they appear for sale here or elsewhere. I've seen guns in similar condition sell for $1000-$1200 on gunbroker. 

Approximately 300 rounds fired, very well cared for. NRA Very Good condition, would rate Excellent except for very light scratch on left frame above magazine release (see photos). No other scratches or marring noted. I intended to carry this gun, but never did, so it has only seen a the inside of a case and range time, no pocket or holster carry. 

Comes with original box, all original docs including manual, one nickel magazine and one stainless steel magazine. 

Shoots very well for such a small short barrel pistol. 

Very collectible gun. I'm only parting with it so I can buy something that I will use more.

So, here is is. 6 inch barrel. No problems with it whatsoever. Its just been occupying safe space.

Wont take a lowball offer since it can go right back into the safe and wait for another 10 years and let my son shoot, ignore, or sell it.

Comes with a leather holster, the pachmayr grips I added, original grips, and a speed loader.

Would like to see buyers ccw permit so I can be sure I'm not selling to a felon.

I should clarify: I didnt buy it new. I had bought it used from Scheels. It is in what I would call very good condition. But it does have some usage evident.

Bought the gun back in 2007, and has only seen about 700 rounds through it. Always very well taken care of and cleaned. The rail is aluminum, and the red dot sight is nothing special but holds true when firing. 2 clips are steel that came with the gun and 2 are tapco. The ammo is Bulgarian surplus corrosive.

Forewarning: The guns sights are canted, but since the gun has a rail it shouldnt matter much. If you really want to fix it you can look up how to online. The bolt carrier is also discolored at bit as you can see in the pictures. You can fix this also if you really want to, a replacement is cheap enough, but the defect is purely cosmetic and does not affect the functioning of the rifle. Other than these 2 issues the gun is in excellent shape, and is a great shooter.

Springfield Armory’s Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details.

They have, once again, raised the expectations of what a polymer pistol can be.

Google it and read the reviews, the 2022 is the best valued pistol you can get. I've shot the SIG P226 quite a bit and this one shoots very similar in my opinion but is about $450 cheaper. I like the weapon a lot but have too many 9mm guns. 800 rounds through it. Will sell face to face to someone with valid CCW permit or use a FFL for the transfer. We can work out those details.

I've done quite a number of modifications on this weapon and really like the way it's turned out - I'm really wanting to swap it for an AK-47 for a shorter OAL.

I've cleaned the barrel extensively (still dark, but in ""shooting grade"" condition) and put a new crown on it - was key-holing before. It shoots well now (see photo of shooting off-hand 40 yards - wasn't benching, just to show it punches clean holes in a reasonable area). I also pulled the front sight block because I wanted to put a small scope or red dot on it (see below).

It has the Tapco compliance kit on it which turns it into a whole different gun. This kit isn't available anymore, but included the following parts when I bought it (I'm also showing current prices for each part):

Gas Tube w/ Rail - $54
T-6 Collapsible Stock w/ Lower Rail (allows use of a foregrip) - $76
Yugo Muzzle Brake (replaces useless grenade launcher) - $13
Gas Piston - $24
Operating Rod - $15
20 Round Magazine - $18

Also has the following parts:
Shell Deflector - $5
Extended Magazine Release - $5
UTG Tri-Rail Receiver Scope Mount (work well and holds zero - you just need to use a Boresnake on this gun instead of traditional rod cleaning) - $27
Tasco 2-6x32 AO scope w/ Illuminated Reticle (holds zero/adjusts OK, but objective labels are off - came with the scope mount - I would probably replace this eventually) - $45

This gun has never failed to digest a round I've put into it. Utterly reliable and in good condition finish-wise. You could probably nail a deer with this rifle or keep it in a closet for emergency use - or just tear up paper with it.

No low-ballers or trades unless you have an AK-47 in good condition."

FAQ
- Please stop asking for the serial number and LOOK at picture #2, which is the data plate of the receiver, where the serial number 50795 is quite obvious!
- Yes, it's a Federal Ordnance gun, and I realize Fed Ord has a checkered reputation.  I cannot comment on the accuracy of this weapon, but I can say from personal experience that it functions reliably.  I loaded it with 5 rounds of chinese spam-can ammo and they fired 1-2-3-4-5 as fast as I pulled the trigger.  No failures to feed or fire or eject, no problems whatsoever.
- I do not see markings on the components for the most part.  There is a small XX on the barrel, and the trigger mechanism (or the hammer anyway) is marked HR (Harrington and Richardson, I believe).  I will be happy to examine or photograph any specific part or area you request.

I'm looking for a combination of guns / ammo in trade. I like my guns ugly and cheap as long as they work properly....I'm not a competition shooter or collector so please don't offer up those kind of firearms. Also, no mods, I prefer stock firearms.

Straight trade for an AR15
