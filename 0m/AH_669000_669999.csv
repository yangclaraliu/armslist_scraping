The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. Maximum effective range with the standard 6-inch barrel is 200 meters (650 ft.). 

The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear and enhances the obturation between the bullet and the bore, thus increasing accuracy. Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The combat-type trigger guard is designed for two-handed shooting. 

The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition. When the last round in the magazine is fired, the slide remains in its maximum recoil position, permitting rapid change of magazine and immediate chambering of a round for instant resumption of firing.

Up for sale or trade I have a 1943 Mosin Nagant M91/59 Carbine. All serial numbers are original and matching. No forced matches. Bore is dark like most but fairly clean and has good rifling. Appears ready to fire. Stock is original and in decent shape for the age with a few imperfections as would be expected of any War Time rifle. Front barrel band is incorrect. Someone had used a rear band on it at some point but it does have the correct arsenal markings. The bands can be had for around $10. The receiver has also been drilled and tapped for a scope mount but there is no scope or mount with it at this time. This is a round receiver rifle with the Izhevsk arsenal markings. For those of you that are not familiar with these rifles, this is not one of the standard $100 1891/30 rifles that are flooding the market. This is a carbine model. From what I have found in my research, there are three versions of the Russian carbine models. The M38, M44, and the M91/59. The M38s and M91/59s are less common to find now. The M44s are selling on Gunbroker for around $250.  Also interested in trades. Would be interested in a good .22 rifle semi auto (10/22, Marlin model 60, Mossberg Tactical 22), SKS, AR15 Lower Receiver or other parts, or nice Pump Shotgun. Feel free to offer other trades. If I am not interested I will let you know in a polite manner. Thanks for looking and feel free to ask questions."

Product Information
The redesigned Leupold VX-3 Rifle Scope combines years of optical technology into one package to create a rifle scope that will become a favorite of hunters and shooters. The Quantum Optical System with Xtended Twilight lens technology advances beyond index matched lenses by specifically targeting the color spectrum that is most present in those critical final minutes of fading light, allowing you to clearly see targets for longer. The lenses also feature the Diamondcoat 2 lens coating which provides abrasion resistance and are edge-blackened to improve resolution by reducing glare. The precision twin spring erector has cryogenically treated adjustments to provide the utmost precision and 30 percent more holding force to ensure reliability. The fast focus eye piece allows for quick adjustments in the field at times when a split second might mean the difference between filling your tag and going home empty-handed. Every Leupold VX-3 Rifle Scope is water, fog and shockproof and is purged with second generation argon/krypton gas. Covered by the Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee.

I've looked into and it's possible it's a factory conversion but I doubt it. As is it is UNSAFE TO FIRE but if someone were more savvy with reloading equipment you could possibly make lower powered Tokarev rounds and be able to fire the gun much cheaper than any other Nagant revolver as 7.62 Tokarev is a lot more common and a lot easier to reload for than the Nagant original rounds and .32 S&W long. You could also buy a replacement cylinder to shoot .32 ACP

As the condition goes it's one of the best I've ever seen a Nagant revolver in. It indexes perfectly, it's never failed to fire for me and everything is very tight.

The Biggest Zombies Experience to Date: Call of Duty: Black Ops II Zombies features three different ways to survive the zombie apocalypse. Unravel the mysteries of a dying Earth in Tranzit, fight endless waves of zombies in Survival mode, or compete in the new 4z4 last-human-standing mode, Grief.

Tranzit
1-4 player co-op in a large open world with a variety of locations. The new Buildables gameplay elements help players move through each area to find the key tidbits that reveal why they are there and what they must do to survive. All the while, public transportation is still operational, as a bus will regularly stop at each location. Zombies ride for free.

Survival
Recreating the classic mode of just purely surviving the shambling, incoming Zombie horde, Survival mode allows you to play 1-4 players co-op in specific locations from the much larger Tranzit area.

Grief
You and friends can take on up to 4 people in a team vs. Zombies vs. team scenario. 2-8 players are thrown in a situation to be the last humans standing.

MP Technology with Zombies: Call of Duty: Black Ops II features new and extensive stat tracking as well as leaderboards for bragging rights. New skill-based matchmaking system will allow players of the same ability to take on the horrors of the night in public game modes. For players that are looking for an extra challenge, Zombies features custom games: Headshots only, higher starting rounds, and toggling of extra items are all available."

These are excerpts By Randy Wakeman from his 2009 review titled: ""Ruger's LCR: The Best .38 Pocket Revolver Ever:
?available at:
http://www.chuckhawks.com/ruger_LCR_revolver.htm


(SELLER'S NOTE: The LCR is offered in 3 Calibers:  22LR, 38 Sp and +P, and 357 cal.)

Ruger's new for 2009 Lightweight Compact Revolver has been billed as the “Evolution of the Revolver.” It has proved to be at least that, if not more. Weighing in at roughly three quarters of a pound, it is hard not to notice how light this wheelgun is for a .38 Special +P revolver and how well it fits the hand. The barrel is only 1-7/8 in. long, the 5-shot revolver itself 1-1/4 inches wide. This is essentially in the J-frame genre of compact revolver, a bit lighter and less costly than the clunky S&W 642 series and the many variants of the platform, including the S&W Model 438 Bodyguard.


What quickly and dramatically sets the Ruger LCR apart from and ahead of the many old 5-shot, double action .38 Specials is the wondrous double-action trigger pull. While the trigger gauge shows it as about a nine pound trigger, Ruger has refined the trigger geometry and spring rates so it feels much lighter. The LCR has a smooth and consistent trigger pull that makes it relatively easy to cycle the cylinder and fire this revolver while maintaining a constant sight picture. As that is the whole idea with a personal defense pistol, Ruger can't be commended too highly for pulling this one off. It has an out-of-the box feel as if it had been tuned by the likes of Jack Weigand. The LCR is that smooth.

The primary ammo used was the Stars & Stripes Custom Ammo 125 grain Speer Gold Dot combat rounds. Shooting through the CED M2 chrono screens, the 5 foot velocity ranged from 767 – 796 fps, which is formidable, especially taking into consideration the diminutive 1-1/8 inch LCR barrel. After shooting fifty rounds of this ammo through the Ruger LCR, I can't call this revolver the ideal plinker by any means, but calling the recoil quite manageable is a fair assessment. It was surprisingly manageable considering the light weight of this handgun. For comparison, let me mention one of my least favorite type of handguns, the common .380 blowback semi-auto. Many of them are just nasty little palm-slappers, with crummy trigger pulls and an unfortunate propensity to stovepipe. Often you'll find them with merciless hard plastic crucifix type grips and slides that find new ways to slice the top of your hand, as well.
The above specs are from Ruger.com

Magpul MS2 Multi Mission Single Point Two Point Sling - Black - Magpul

Driven by the operational experience of Magpul Dynamics instructors, the MS Multi-Mission Sling System was designed to give a versatile weapon-retention solution for a multitude of tactical environments and missions. As a standalone product, the rapidly-convertible MS2 allows an operator to leverage the maneuverability of single-point attachment for direct-action, or two-point attachment for stability. Single-hand adjustments, quick-detach lanyard and positive-locking metal hardware provide flexibility and durability in a truly adaptable sling system.

The MS2 enables seamless transitions into an array of shooting positions without getting bound or fouled. The MS2 concept allows switching from Weapon Shoulder to Reaction Shoulder for shooting around corners, under vehicles, or to minimize exposure. The MS2 can also increase operator survivability by keeping the weapon in the fight in case of injury to the operator's shoulder, arm, or hand.

The concept is simple: Your survivability rate dramatically increases if your gear allows you to move freely in a dynamic environment."

The passenger front brake needs servicing (cylinder), the clutch linkage also need to be re-attached (it's the rod that connects the pedal to the clutch fork).
The pictures are a few month old and I have since done some more improvements to the Jeep (installed the fender marker lights, cut holes in the dash for the smaller gauges, installed the ignition switch in dash, light switch, little things like that)

There are also some extra parts to go with the Jeep (Another heavy duty front bumper, side nerf bars, spare tire carrier, electric winch, KC Daylighter off-road lights, etc. . .. . .)

If you are somewhat mechanically inclined you would be able to finish this thing. This Jeep is a BEAST and has plenty of power and gearing to climb anything. It is the only one I know of in this configeration. The motor was installed by at Segura's Automotive in Santa Fe. I have a lot of time and money invested in this Jeep, but I got sidetracked with another project that took precedence over this one. Honestly, this was a summer project that I just lost interest in.

It's LNIB less than 300 rounds through it, cleaned it after every shoot. I'm more of an iron sights kinda guy so I'm looking for one with the front sight already on it. This upper is perfect for those who prefer to use electronic sights or optics. The company makes their own receivers but I believe they order their barrels from Bushmaster.

 If you've been following for the last week you know I'm a hobby dealer selling out. You also know that about 50% of my list is gone. The response has been great, and I've enjoyed meeting those that have purchased.

 The updated list has nearly all the items listed at my cost, some below my cost, and none more than $10 over my cost. Many are well below current dealer's cost and some will be below dealer's cost even after tax. They aren't going to get cheaper unless you make an offer for the remaining stock.

 Paperwork will be done.
 Background calls will be made.
 Tax will be charged at 0.0885%.
 Even though it's a hobby, it's set up as a legitimate business and all laws and regulations will be met.

 I only meet to sell, not to show. Wish I had a storefront to help those still shopping, and I love to visit as much as anybody, but with a full time job I don't have time to meet unless you know what you're looking for.

Evenings are tough, as I'm only available after 6:30pm, and I won't meet very late.  Meetings should not take more than 15 minutes start to finish.

The list is shortened even from yesterday's post.
