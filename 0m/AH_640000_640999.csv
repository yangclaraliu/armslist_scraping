They bought the polymer lowers from Walther ( basically the P99) and finished off the gun in their Minnesota plant with their steel parts. It fits the hand real well amd has good balance. It is a quick action which means that once the slide is pulled back the trigger is at half cocked and takes very little to pull. As it cycles it returns to the half cocked position each time. Once you have chambered a round there is a decocker. Once this is done the first pull on the trigger is longer and each pull after that is the shorter. It is advisable that when you are carrying it to have it in the decocked position. If you were to take out the weapon in the half cocked position it would take very little to pressure to go off. It has 2- 17 round magazines and a hard case that it came on. I bought it new a little over a year ago and have put about 400-500 rounds through it. It is in excellent condidtion.

They were originally made for the Romanin Patriotic Guard. The Romanian 'G' has a chrome lined bore, and many were hardly ever fired.

As far as I can tell other than the receiver it is all matching and original parts. 
Accuracy is really good! There is not sight canter or mag wobble. It has the forward grip which really helps with control and to keeping the gun on target. I have two many AK's and need to let this one go.

Browning Hi-Power pistols were used during World War II by both Allied and Axis forces. After occupying Belgium in 1940, German forces took over the FN plant. German troops subsequently used the Hi-Power, having assigned it the designation Pistole 640(b) (""b"" for belgisch, ""Belgian""). Examples produced by FN in Belgium under German occupation bear German inspection and acceptance marks, or Waffenamts, such as WaA613. In German service, it was used mainly by Waffen-SS and Fallschirmjäger personnel.

Hi-Power pistols were also produced in Canada for Allied use, by John Inglis and Company in Toronto. The plans were sent from the FN factory to Britain when it became clear the Belgian plant would fall into German hands, enabling the Inglis factory to be tooled up for Hi-Power production for Allied use. Inglis produced two versions of the Hi-Power, one with a fixed rear sight and one with an adjustable rear sight and detachable shoulder stock (primarily for a Nationalist Chinese contract). The pistol was popular with the British airborne forces as well as covert operations and commando groups such as the Special Operations Executive (SOE), the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the nascent British Special Air Service (SAS) Regiment."

Since I've inherited, my friends and I have fired 20 total rounds of factory weatherby 270 magnum rounds.  This rifle is a pleasure to shoot and unfortunately, I don't hunt or have a use for it.  The value of this gun retails for $2300 as listed on the Weatherby website.  Due to it's age and low serial number, it will eventually be a collectible item

Trade value is $1200.00 obro, 
Cash value is $1100.00 obro

which includes Factory Weatherby scope (2x - 7x), factory leather 2 point sling, 20 rounds of 270 weatherby magnum rounds.  It has a cheap centerpoint scope mounted right now due to the magnification adjustment being seized on the weatherby scope .  I can include that as well.

The SR-556 offers Ruger’s proven ruggedness and reliability while changing the AR-15 platform to a piston driven system. The gas piston driven SR-556 runs cleaner, cooler, and is easier to maintain than gas impingement rifles, offering significantly improved reliability due to the reasons offered earlier. The patent-pending two-stage piston driven operating system in the new Ruger SR-556 provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the action and vents combustion residue out of the bottom of the gas block. - Tactical Life

It's fast, under 10 secs do switch barrels and BCGs. Both rounds are very cheap; $200/1000 rounds for the 7.62x39, which is penetration and hard hitting round, more than .223 in case you need it and $150/1080 rounds for the 5.45x39, only 4 time more expensive than the .22lr but 10 time the penetration and more reliable cuz of its tumbling so you won't break the bank shooting it, and it's super easy, the easiest upper to clean. It's been fired both calibers for under 200 rounds so basically it's brand new. And also, the Complete Upper will include 11 mags of each caliber so 22 mags total, and they all coupled. I will miss it a lot but have other projects to get on so I gotta say bye to it. If you want more informations please give me a call at REDACTED or you can email me at REDACTED Thanks!"

I am the original owner, it has 141000 original miles, and is partially restored; it has a balanced and blue-printed 390 cubic inch engine with 10.5 to 1 forged pistons, an RV cam, 10-quart oil pan, high velocity oil pump, all the Edelbrock high-rise parts, 600 carb,  air-cleaner and valve covers.  The front end has been completely gone through, with new knuckle joints, Warn hubs, new steering arms, and it has the Rancho 3-inch lift kit with dual shocks in front and the spring kit and single shocks in the rear, a Detroit Locker rear end, Hellwig Over-loads leaf-spring helpers, full towing package with brake kit.  It has 35-inch aluminum slotted rims, and Wild Country RVT Radial tires I would estimate about 50% tread remaining.
I spent over $20,000 invested in the truck, and then gave it to my son to finish, who has been in the Army since 2000, and is stationed over seas, and it has been in storage ever since.  The only thing left to complete is the bodywork and paint.  There is minimal rust, and the bed and box is solid, no rust in the places that kills these, because I was anal about washing this thing’s underbelly.  There are also numerous boxes of extra parts that we gathered over the years to use to complete the project.  It also has a Sony hi-end stereo system and power amp and it has a Roll bar, custom made tonneau cover.  My son now wants to sell it and buy a new truck on his retirement after his 20-years in the service.

This is an excellent project truck to complete with a little time and elbow grease for the backyard mechanic; however, sitting for the last 12 years in my cousin’s machine shed, has shown me that it was neglected just by sitting there and even though it was on concrete, and varmint free, it still sat for 12 years and that is why I have reduced the price.

If you have one in decent shape let me know.  I'd be looking to take it into the woods and use it, so I don't need a collector's piece.  I'm also flexible on the price - I know some models are worth more than others and condition will come into pricing as well.

All matching numbers from what I can see besides the stock. Top hand guard is definitely not matched. Stock may be matched but numbers are too worn to make out. Bore is average? (not sure how to grade bores) Rifle was covered in cosmoline inside and out when I purchased the rifle most of it is now removed but may need a minor cleaning. Comes with 20 rounds of Prvi Partizan 8x56R boxed ammo and one German eagle crest marked clip. I have never fired this rifle. 


I'm fairly new to shooting and this rifle was an impulse buy. I do not have the funds for ammunition to shoot it as much as I wish so I decided to cut my losses. Any offers to help a young shooter get started in this wonderful way of life will be greatly appreciated, thanks. ~Terrence

The Remington 788 is an iconic and accurate hunting rifle developed by the Remington Arms Company. The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 3 rounds. The distinguishing feature of the 788 is its rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has 9 lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Because of this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lugged bolts. The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The receiver also has a small ejection port and no bolt lug raceways, making the receiver stiffer than a Remington 700, although it is the same outside diameter. Remington made extensive use of 'screw-machines' in the manufacture of this rifle. The 788 was discontinued in the 1980s. In its used form, the 788 retains a cult following for its accuracy."

One of the primary reasons for the .30-30's popularity amongst deer hunters is its light recoil. Average recoil from a typical 150-grain (9.7 g) load at 2,390 feet per second (730 m/s) in a 7.5-pound (3.4 kg) rifle is 10.6 pounds-force (47 N) of felt recoil at the shooter's shoulder. This, combined with the cartridge's ability to take the majority of large game in North America, as long as the game is within 200 yards (180 m) of the shooter, results in a highly effective hunting round."

It's only been fired a couple dozen times, mostly to get the Nikon Prostaff 3-9x40 scope calibrated. I bought the scope new for about $150 the same time as the rifle.

The rifle has a black synthetic stock and blue finish barrel. There are a few minor scratches on the stock from walking in thick woods, and there is a cap on the bottom of the grip that fell off (see photo) but could probably be super glued back on. Other than that, the gun and scope are in excellent condition.

I'm selling it because I've been bow and shotgun hunting and haven't used this rifle in 2 years. I'm looking to take the money from selling this and putting it toward a semi-auto .223 for predator hunting."

What are you thinking?

In Oantigunbamas own words.

At the end of a long answer to the question, “What has your administration done or planned to do to limit the availability of assault weapons?” Obama said this:

“But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don’t belong on our streets. And so what I’m trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally. Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced. But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence. Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there’s an awful lot of violence and they’re not using AK-47s. They’re using cheap hand guns.”

Tight, accurate little rifle. Dialed in at 100 yards, will clover leaf 3 round groups. My son used it to learn correct holding/supportive techniques at Appleseed, it was perfect for a young man to learn about safe gun handling and hone his accuracy. It also helped him to learn chamber to muzzle cleaning by removing the bolt. Bore is clean and shiny, he probably put well over 1,000 rounds down the barrel and learned something with every shot.

One of the primary reasons for the .30-30's popularity amongst deer hunters is its light recoil. Average recoil from a typical 150-grain (9.7 g) load at 2,390 feet per second (730 m/s) in a 7.5-pound (3.4 kg) rifle is 10.6 pounds-force (47 N) of felt recoil at the shooter's shoulder. This, combined with the cartridge's ability to take the majority of large game in North America, as long as the game is within 200 yards (180 m) of the shooter, results in a highly effective hunting round."

This idiot of a president wants to put sites like this out of business!

What are you thinking?

In Oantigunbamas own words.

At the end of a long answer to the question, “What has your administration done or planned to do to limit the availability of assault weapons?” Obama said this:

“But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don’t belong on our streets. And so what I’m trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally. Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced. But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence. Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there’s an awful lot of violence and they’re not using AK-47s. They’re using cheap hand guns.”

I am not a hunter so I will see if I can trade it. I am looking for an AK or an AR with trade up or down. I can throw cash if you have something I like. Tactical rifles are what I am looking for but I am open to any offers. I can travel a few miles for the right trade.

One of the primary reasons for the .30-30's popularity amongst deer hunters is its light recoil. Average recoil from a typical 150-grain (9.7 g) load at 2,390 feet per second (730 m/s) in a 7.5-pound (3.4 kg) rifle is 10.6 pounds-force (47 N) of felt recoil at the shooter's shoulder. This, combined with the cartridge's ability to take the majority of large game in North America, as long as the game is within 200 yards (180 m) of the shooter, results in a highly effective hunting round."

I bought it from MidwayUSA about a year ago. I have shot approx. 200 or so rounds through it using my brothers 1911, and I did have a little trouble with it jamming every once in awhile, (especially at first). I later read that Ciener recommended shooting higher velocity .22 for breaking it in, but I never got to try it. I noticed on the slide after I'd had it for awhile, that someone had marked faintly with a marker ""2nd"". The only reason for marking it as a 2nd that I can think of, is that when I got it the finish was worn off the rear sight. My brother has a Ciener conversion kit that is pretty much identical to this one, it looks and works the same, and his wasn't marked as a 2nd, so I think it was only the worn finish on the rear sight that caused it to be marked that way."

It's tough, well built, and feature packed. One of the few saws on the market that bevels to both sides, the Hitachi lets you make compound cuts to the right or left without the hassle of transferring marks or repositioning stock

Unlike other top-heavy saws, the Hitachi remains well balanced and easy to maneuver--which, along with its smooth-operating blade guard, makes it a relatively safe saw to use. The saw's table allows a good miter range, swinging 57 degrees right and 46 degrees left, and the unique bevel and miter scale makes cutting crown molding a snap whether you're an expert or a novice.

Hitachi's multi-V-belt soft-start transfer delivers power smoothly. The saw doesn't jump or buck on start-up, so cuts are generally safe and easy to keep true. The saw cuts 3-1/2- to 12-inch stock at a 90-degree miter, and at 45 degrees the saw handles a 9-inch cut. We also like that the Hitachi features adjustable plastic fences that give support when cutting small pieces close to the blade."

939,http://www.armslist.com/posts/640939,For Sale:  4-Piece Modular Sleep System (NEW),"All of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois",$ 130,"Listed On: Friday, November 2, 2012",Hunting,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Modular Sleep System - 4 Part

The MSS sleeping bags are constructed to be used in conjunction with each other, or separately to complete a system known as the extreme cold weather sleeping bag. The MSS is designed to provide comfort in temperatures ranging from 50°F to -30°F.  This means one can sleep comfortably at these temperatures with the appropriate combination of the sleep system. 
The Waterproof Bivy Cover is produced utilizing GORE-TEX, a waterproof, moisture-vapor-permeable material with all seams heat sealed. The Compression Stuff Sack is constructed with water resistant materials with adequate volume for both bags as well as the bivy cover. This unique stuff sack compresses the system to one cubit foot. 
The 4-Part Modular Sleep System includes: 
•Green Patrol Bag 
•Black Intermediate Bag 
•Woodland Camouflage GORE-TEX Waterproof Bivy Cover 
•Black Compression Stuff Sack 
NOTE FROM SELLER:
To keep your sleep system lasting for years to come, here are some things I do with my personal gear: 
1)	When not using your sleep system, keep it in a large storage bag such as a large nylon laundry bag. I get mine at WalMart or Target.  These bags are usually blue or green and will hold the entire system.  The reason for this is not to compress the synthetic fibers that fill the sleep system.  If kept in the stuff sack for long periods of time the sleep system will lose loft causing the sleep system to become less likely to keep you warm when needed most. 
2)	Over time, the Gore-Tex Bivy cover will lose some of its water repellency. This all depends on the amount of use and how clean you keep the gear.  Once a year I treat all of my Gore-Tex equipment with a two part system:
	First I wash all of my Gore-Tex gear with NIKWAX-TECH WASH.  Making sure you follow the instructions on the 	bottle.  The Tech Wash will thoroughly clean the Gore-Tex fibers and other synthetic water resistant gear one 	may have. 
	Second, I rewash using NIKWAX TX-DIRECT.  This will refortify the waterproofness of any Gore-Tex or synthetic 	gear you may have.  
IN ADDITION, PLEASE READ THE CARE LABELS FOR ALL OF YOUR GEAR WHEN WASHING OR DRYING ANY SYNTHETIC MATERIAL. 
Thank you for looking."

It's not the Model 1905 or Model 10, S&W just called it a .38 Military & Police. A transitional (post-WW II) gun had some features of a pre-WW II model and some of the later version; some major stuff like the long vs. short action, and some minor features like the shape of the ejector rod tip and frame stampings. It is essentially identical to a 1905 Fourth Change except that it has the postwar hammer safety block. That was a big engineering change and probably deserves to be reflected in the nomenclature. 

These transitional S-prefix guns are transitional between the wartime Victory models and the short-action M&P that was introduced in 1948. The gun was probably shipped in 1946. It is a very low serial number for the isolated S-prefix; like guns of that particular era with a 6-inch barrel were also very uncommon. All serial numbers match, it's all original, locks up tight, shoots like a dream. I does show holster wear. The SV prefix (still conceptually part of the Victory series, though military victory had been achieved several months earlier) was last seen on guns with serial numbers in the SV811xxx range. As stated above, the ""S"" in the serial number means it has a new hammer-blocking safety device, and that feature was introduced for the Victory K Model in late WWII. 

I'm asking $340. or am willing to work on a trade or  am willing to entertain any other offers. These transitional pieces with a six inch barrel don't pop up to often anymore. I'm cutting down to only three pistol calibers, so here's a chance to add to your S&W collection."
