Now they are equipped with our externally adjustable X-Mark Pro® trigger system.

I’m reducing my collection of long guns while growing my handgun collection.  Up for trade today is my Winchester .30-30, Model 94.  The serial number indicates the mfg. date approx 1960. This was the end of the classic Winchesters that were made with hand-finished cast parts.
 These are the higher value, collector 30-30's.  Feel free to research it!
Don't let the age fool you though, it is still a shooter and is in excellent shape.  I can “tag” a bowling ball pin at 100 yards with the open steel sights!  There are no nicks or gouges in the hard wood stock and fore stock; the bluing is no longer the deep blue;  The Winchester is completely  original.   My guns are kept in a humidity controlled safe.

New Benelli Super Sport 12 ga/. 30"" ported barrel
The Benelli SuperSport is the ultimate choice for a fast 12-gauge shotgun for sporting clays. This Benelli shotgun is truly a “speed gun.” The SuperSport’s ComforTech® recoil-dampening system allows the shooter to recover for the critical second shot up to 69% faster than with other comparable shotguns! Couple the quick recovery speed with a ported barrel that keeps muzzle climb to a minimum and it’s doubly fast. And the ComforTech® system’s special gel recoil pad and comb insert reduce felt recoil by up to 48% compared to the competition. When one clay often separates the winners from the losers, the SuperSport with it's superior reliability, faster recovery time, lower recoil and denser shot patterns, is almost like having an unfair advantage. 12ga with 30"" barrel,no trade please,ship to ffl dealer"

New Benelli Super Sport 12 ga/. 30"" ported barrel
The Benelli SuperSport is the ultimate choice for a fast 12-gauge shotgun for sporting clays. This Benelli shotgun is truly a “speed gun.” The SuperSport’s ComforTech® recoil-dampening system allows the shooter to recover for the critical second shot up to 69% faster than with other comparable shotguns! Couple the quick recovery speed with a ported barrel that keeps muzzle climb to a minimum and it’s doubly fast. And the ComforTech® system’s special gel recoil pad and comb insert reduce felt recoil by up to 48% compared to the competition. When one clay often separates the winners from the losers, the SuperSport with it's superior reliability, faster recovery time, lower recoil and denser shot patterns, is almost like having an unfair advantage. 12ga with 30"" barrel,no trade please,ship to ffl deale"

Ithaca Deerslayer Model 37 Featherlight 12G for sale. I'm selling this as well as a .22 that I'm not even sure what it is. I'm trying to get enough funds to buy a Glock. I prefer 9mm, but will take up to .45, so if you're willing to cut a deal and do a two for one, please let me know. As long as it works, I'm fine with it. Doesn't have to be pretty. The rifles I have are both very old and are no longer produced and aren't in perfect condition either. Come check them out if you want! Just looking for a Glock!

I looked up the shotgun model on GunBroker and GunsAmerica, but I know the gun is valued from $250-500 depending on condition. I'm only looking to trade both my guns for a single Glock.

VERY ACCURATE and features a blaze orange front blade sight and adjustable rear sight w/ white outline.

***Upon a recent inspection there is one fault. The right side grip panel has a tiny section of checkering, about 4 diamonds big, that is missing. I did not notice this until I had just took it out a few weeks ago. It seems to have been there before. I never dropped it or anything stupid like that. Though disappointing it may be, it really is  barely noticable. I took the best pic I could folks.***

It is a ""Dash 3"" so this was the last line of 686's to have forged internals (including hammer and trigger). No transfer bar, of course. Comes with original wooden grips but no box.

The CVA Electra is the ultimate muzzleloader in ease of use, rapid reloading, ease of cleaning and never fail reliability. And all CVA Electra's are equipped with a premium Bergara Barrel - for unmatched accuracy.
