The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE is at the forefront with Tapco's 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but Tapco has made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, they made the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, they redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, they made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But they didn't just stop on improving the spring, they also totally revamped the follower.

Tapco has kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won't be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag.

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

These are all new and i mean new not used and cleaned up,only a couple have faint shelf storage marks from sitting in my safe for quit a while. I was debating on weather or not to sell these or not since i was forced to sell my hk91 a while ago and had plans on getting another one or another brand or mabye a parts kit but it is just not in the cards at all at this point and probobly wont be for quite a long time to come. I bought these to put away as spares since i had some ""range mags"" to use that were less than perfect so all they have done is sit. I would like 40.00 each for them and cash works fine as well as money orders moneypak or paypal. I will ship them for whatever it will cost me,but i will not ship these anywhere where it is illegal to own them period no exceptions,sorry to everybody in new york and elsewhere, and i will check the laws out before i ship them to anywhere,sorry but im not willing to get yanked by the feds for something as lame as a 20 round mag. For any questions or for pictures please let me know,these are guarenteed original HK GENUINE mags,stamped and dated and not the dollar store mags that i have seen plenty of lately,all of the ones i have used at the range have worked flawlessly,aluminum mag,stainless follower and steel floor plate. There is no replacement for genuine quality parts,pieces and mags, you really do get what you pay for. I will also be willing to trade the lot of mags for antique remington double barrel shotguns,working or not so if you have something please let me know. Thank you and please check out my other ads.

The Trophy Match 1911 is the flagship 1911 pistol in the Springfield Armory line. It comes with every feature you could possibly need, and is made to the most exacting specifications.

The frame and slide are made from forged steel. The rounded surfaces of the frame and slide are bead-blasted, while the flats are polished; giving the pistol a distinctive and classy look. The hardwood Cocobolo grips stand out nicely against the blued steel frame.
The match grade barrel is made from stainless steel, and is supported at the front with a stainless match grade barrel bushing. The guide rod is two-piece, which is the original 1911 style.

The sights are fully adjustable target style. The front sight is dovetail mounted into the slide. The adjustable sights are made by Novak, and are considered to be some of the best on the market. The rear notch and front sight blade align with just enough ""air"" around the sight picture to let you know that your sight blade is centered. Once adjusted, they stay adjusted, even after thousands of rounds.

The trigger is match grade as well, and is slightly longer than on other models, putting the first pad of most shooters' trigger fingers right on the front face. The pull on the trigger is 4.5 to 5 pounds, perfect for target shooting. The trigger is adjustable for over travel, too.

The slide has angled serrations on the front and rears, letting you grasp the slide with either hand quickly. The front strap is checkered for a solid grip.

An ambidextrous safety makes the pistol more easily used by left-handed shooters, or those who shoot with either hand.

The magazine well is wide at the bottom, and is bevelled to allow you to insert the magazine quickly without looking. The two supplied magazines have slam pads to aid in fast insertion. 

What more could you ask for?

The price includes shipping/handling. Missouri residents must pay state sales taxes.

Im trying to repair several of these shotguns that have been in the family since new and i would like to get at least a couple of them repaired with whatever turns up. And just to answer the question that at least a couple of people will have, i am not trying to build any guns,piece guns together,stockpile parts to sell,or sell anything that might turn up, nothing not 1 piece is going to get sold,traded or otherwise gotten rid of for purpose of profit like most people that post these type of ads, i am straight forward honestly trying to repair family heirlooms that mean more to me than 20.00 i might score off of a part or offend anyone for selling the parts that i got from them. The only parts that will not be kept around or disposed of or destroied are damaged parts that are unsafe and could kill someone like bulged or split barrels or a cracked reciever. So if anyone out there has anything lying around or sitting in the closet all rusted up that you do not want please let me know and we can work something out with a trade or cash or whatever.

This rifle doesn't have the 1 in 9 twist barrel like many of the others for sale.  This has a 1 in 7 twist meaning it will shoot the higher grain bullets more accurately and the barrel is chrome lined for durability.  Face it, this is a tank.  If there was any AR15 I would want to take with me as this ban is passed shortly, this is the one.  Very few manufacturers can touch the quality and detail that this rifle possesses.  And since it is brand new, this is a perfect purchase.  You can't order these.  You can't find these.  It's impossible to get anything right now and most people are paying $2000 for ""plinkers.""

I am selling this as-is with the manufacturers warranty.  This is a private sale and I can ship if requested ($50).  I will pay the FFL fee to send, but you will have to pay the fee for receiving.  If a private face to face sale, the law requires us to provide each other their current Ohio ID (govt issue, driving, etc) and verbally confirm if you have any felonies.  There is no background check and no record of transfer as required by law.  If you are looking to get something pre-BAN, look no further.  This is it!

At last, the SCAR 17S is here. The new rifle is a semi-automatic-only version of the military’s selective-fire MK17 Mod 0 or Special Ops Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) Heavy. Chambered in .308 Win./7.62x51 mm NATO, the gun is bigger and more powerful than its .223 Rem./5.56x45 mm NATO predecessor, the SCAR 16S, but, thankfully, not objectionably so. No longer constrained by limitations of that gun’s smaller receiver and chambering, the bigger SCAR 17S greatly expands the potential utility of the SCAR platform. One can argue that the SCAR Heavy was what Special Operations Command (SOCOM) wanted all along: a modern carbine chambered in 7.62x51 mm NATO that is lightweight, reliable and accurate.

Experience the long-range accuracy, downrange power, exceptional reliability and match winning versatility of the FN SCAR™ 17S, the semi-auto only version of the U.S. Special Operations Command’s newest service rifle. Chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO (308 Win.), the SCAR 17S features a free-floating, cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC 16.25” barrel with hard chromed bore, 1 in 12” twist. Fully-ambidextrous operating controls instantly adapt the SCAR 17S to any user or any shooting position. The receiver-integrated MIL-STD 1913 optical rail plus three accessory rails enable mounting of a wide variety of scopes, electronic sights, tactical lights and lasers. The telescoping, side-folding polymer stock is fully adjustable for comb height and length of pull, making it ideal for Heavy Metal 3-Gun matches. O/A length is 28.5” folded, 38.5” extended. This gun weighs 8 pounds empty.

Also included in this sale is 11 extra magazines: 6 Flat Dark Earth and 5 Black.

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 27 boxes available. Price is $20/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush. If you take them all, I'll split the shipping with you.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

ONLY 223 ammo I've seen in a retail store in the last couple weeks was $30 for 20, and there were only a handful of those even left.

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. 5 box minimum on orders I have to ship."

From just doing a 360 degree small print stippling job to removing finger grooves, changing the grip angle. The grip reduction gives you a better grip for control of the weapon and recoil, the stippling gives you a confident and secure grip far better than any grip from weapon manufacturers and rubber slip on grips. The stippling is permanent so you don't have to worry about grip fading, damage from weather, slipping off, getting slippery when wet or bloody, etc etc.

I complete full jobs within a short amount of time for a fast turnaround, unlike other places that can hold your weapon up to a month sometimes more to complete.

My number is REDACTED you can text me anytime or call during daytime hours. My email address is REDACTED, My prices start at $50. If your not sure or have questions feel free to ask. I will let you hold and inspect my work so you can better understand what kind of product your getting.

This rifle is made by the grandfathers of the AR15 industry.  An amazing story but this rifle is perfect.  I also included a pic of the sheet in the  material.  They include a lined up of the actual people who built this rifle!  Truly, this is a must have and in my opinion, one of the best built rifles I have held.  Don't just buy a rifle online, just one that has a LIFETIME warranty and know that this is the last AR15 you will ever have to buy.  It is made with the MIL spec bolt carrier, not the cheap ones found in lower quality rifles and has a chrome lined barrel (high quality barrel).  This is brand new, in the case, never fired!

I am selling this as-is with the lifetime manufacturers warranty. This is a private sale and I can ship if requested ($50). I will pay the FFL fee to send, but you will have to pay the fee for receiving. If a private face to face sale, the law requires us to provide each other their current Ohio ID (govt issue, driving, etc) and verbally confirm if you have any felonies. There is no background check and no record of transfer as required by law. If you are looking to get something pre-BAN, look no further. This is it! When the BAN is announced, if you keep this brand new, I am sure you will be able to demand three times what it is worth.

Here is my Bushmaster AR15 223/556 (chrome barrel) up for sale; it has just about everything except bipod (may throw in tactical light/laser combo for good offer); less than 300 rounds through it over the years, and in excellent condition.  Eotech sight, collapsible stock, folding forend grip, 100 round Beta C-mag, 5-30 round magazines, plus just over 1,000 rounds of premium brass (mix of .223 and 5.56) only ammo.  Open to reasonable offers, and would like to sell as a package deal.  Thank you, and please provide your contact information when making cash offers.  Would like to sell this before this weekend's gun show.

Just to give you an idea of what I have invested (before tax, and before all the pre-ban hysteria)

-Bushmaster with minor customization was just shy of $1k 
-Eotech holographic sight, just under $500
-Beta C-mag (90 trouble-free rounds through it) $250
-1000+ rds of ammo, some HP, etc; commercial avg of .50 per round, around $500+
-5-30 round aftermarket mags were $25 each, or $125 total
...will throw in the two ammo cans, you may need/want them, too.

Very open to reasonable cash offers (or maybe trade combinations), not going to price-gouge anyone, (like those selling stripped down versions on here). Conservatively invested $2,375.00 before tax, but again, please be fair with your offers."

Up for sale is a Colt M4 Carbine.  It's the Tactical Rimfire model, meaning it shoots .22LR.  The best thing about this rifle is it can shoot full power .22LR and ultra low power (nearly silent) .22LR and can adjust the bolt speed, even for Ammo that isn't supposed to cycle semi-auto weapons.  (10/22 can't do that without modifications).  This a great training tool.  And fantastic for plinking!  No, it will not shoot 5.56/.223.

A few even claim that their magazines are brand-new, when in fact they are actually used and some are even placed in non-factory common clear plastic and heat-sealed.  When questioned, one seller even said ""Well.. a Pmag is a Pmag,"" which is @#$%^&!  If this was true, why would a company (such as Magpul) make improvements/modifications to their products thus creating 2nd, 3rd, 4th, generation models?  Don't fall for this shady @#$%^&! or overpay!  Before you hand over your hard-earned cash, do some simple research and know what the visual Pmag differences are and what the factory Magpul plastic packaging looks like.  Ads placed without photographs of the item are usually sketchy as well, so be cautious.  I hope this information helps some buyer out.  Good luck & God bless an armed America!"

Norinco China made SKS. I'm the only owner and purchased this in 1995. Have approximately 300 rounds through it. Overall condition I would say is good. 20 inch barrel with bayonet attachment. Adjustable rear sight. Has custom synthetic folding stock. 

Some slight rust on barrel in areas. Functions extremely well, is well worn rifle and my family and I used as a camping rifle. Comes with a fully functional ""Hell Fire"" trigger. If you don't know what that is please email me for details.

I am throwing in an additional ""Hell Fire"" trigger assembly, approximately 280 rounds of
7.62x39mm ammunition, 3 stripper clips.

What it does not have is original wood stock, box, papers or a clip or magazine. I was told this particular make accepts standard AK magazines. Price is 500.00. Thanks for looking, email any additional questions."

Bipod stud mounted in quad rail.  Folding forward pistol grip with storage compartment.  Bayonet lug.  Flip up night sights present, but no glow left in tritium tubes.  A new Israeli extractor and extractor spring were installed after purchase.  The serial number starts with GAL and the ejector lug and receiver looks great.  There have been between 350 and 500 rounds fired through the rifle since I purchased it new.  Bore is in fantastic shape.  Shoots brass or steel case ammo.
This rifle is a combination of an AR-15 and an AK-47.  The receiver is milled and the folding stock is very solid and locks up tight, made from steel tubing and a cast aluminum butt section.  This rifle has a chromed gas piston and a right side charging handle, that can be charged with the left hand also as it is vertically oriented.  The rifle is much more accurate than the typical AK-47 type design.  Chrome lined barrel.  The front sight hood is a full circle, so it is easy to line up with the ar style flip 2 size peep rear sights.  There are flip up night sights but the tritium does not glow, the tritium tubes can be replaced if you search online.  
The magazines are all in very good shape and are metal, not plastic.  There are (12) 35 round magazines.  There are (5) 12 round magazines-purchased new (unused).

It has only been shot maybe 50 times. It is an awesome gun, especially for carry purposes. It is a great shooter and has a really smooth DAO trigger with second strike capability, which means that if your shell doesnt go off the first time for some reason you have the ability to try a second time. The magazine will hold 15 rounds and it comes with two mags.  Of the 50 or so rounds that I shot I had no failures of any kind and the gun was very accurate, shooting to point of aim. The only reason I am selling it is that I have a couple other .40 callibers and just dont need this one. It comes with the plastic carrying case and the gun includes a rail system for mounting a light or laser on.  It has, as you can see, a stainless slide and black frame. If you have any questions please contact me and thanks for looking!"
