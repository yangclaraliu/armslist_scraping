This is not an AK. This is a heavy barrel squad weapon built on the AK design for extended firing, accuracy and performance. Design includes a flip-down carrying handle, folding heavy-duty steel stock, rear windage adjustable sight and heavy duty receiver.

Design details:
Operating mechanism - The AES-10B RPK functions identically to the AK-47. It also uses the same 7.62x39mm ammunition. It has a similar design layout to the AK-47 series of rifles, with modifications to increase the RPK's effective range and accuracy, enhance its sustained fire capability, and strengthen the receiver.

Features - Most notably, the AES-10B RPK has a heavier and longer barrel (23.5"") than an AK. This allows the AES-10B RPK to fire for extended periods of time without major loss in accuracy due to the barrel heating up. The chrome-lined barrel is permanently fixed to the receiver, and cannot be replaced in the field. It is fitted with a new front sight base, gas block (lacks the bayonet lug) and an under-barrel cleaning rod guide. The barrel also features a folding bipod, mounted near the muzzle. The barrel's muzzle is threaded, enabling the use of muzzle devices such as flash hiders, compensators, and blank-firing adapters. When a muzzle device is not being used, the threads on the muzzle can be covered by a thread protector. The barrel is pinned to the receiver in a modified trunnion, reinforced by ribbing, and is slightly wider than the trunnion used on standard AK type rifles. Symmetrical bulges on both sides of the front trunnion ensure proper fit inside the receiver.

The AES-10B RPK's receiver cover is stamped from a smooth 1.5 mm (0.1 in) sheet of steel (compared to the 1 mm sheet metal receiver cover used on standard AK rifles). Interchangeability of parts between the RPK and AK is moderate.

The AES-10B RPK uses a modified AK recoil spring assembly. It consists of a rear spring guide rod from the AK, and a new forward flat guide rod and coil spring.

The RPK features a thick wood foregrip, and a folding steel buttstock, which is designed to allow the user to carry and store more easily. The RPK uses a standard AK pistol grip.

The weapon can use standard AK detachable box magazines, but is most commonly used with a 40 round capacity magazine, or a 75 round drum magazine.

Sights - The weapon's rear sight leaf is elevation adjustable, and graduated for ranges of 100 to 1,000 meters, in 100 m increments. The rear sight leaf also features a windage adjustment knob, unique to the RPK series of rifles."

By Mike Lillis	 - 01/03/13 11:53 AM ET

House Democrats will waste no time in the new Congress pushing legislation to tighten the nation's gun laws. 

Reps. Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.) and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) will introduce a proposal Thursday, the first day of the 113th Congress, to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines like those used last month in the Newtown, Conn., elementary school massacre.
The legislation will be introduced after the 113th Congress is officially gaveled in Thursday, the same day that children from Sandy Hook Elementary School returned to classes for the first time since a lone gunman stormed into the school and fatally shot 26 people. They are attending school at a different location.
The shooter, a 20-year-old who reportedly had a history of mental illness, fatally shot himself as the police moved in. 
McCarthy, DeGette and other gun-control advocates say the elimination of ammunition magazines that hold dozens of bullets would help lessen the carnage in such indiscriminate shootings.
""These assault magazines help put the ‘mass’ in ‘mass shooting’ and anything we can do to stop their proliferation will save lives in America,” McCarthy said in a statement. Her husband was killed and her son seriously injured in a 1993 shooting on a Long Island, N.Y., commuter train. 
""These devices are used to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time possible, and we owe it to innocent Americans everywhere to keep them out of the hands of dangerous people,"" McCarthy said.
""We don’t even allow hunters to use them,"" she added. ""Something’s deeply wrong if we’re protecting game more than we’re protecting innocent human beings.""

The reformers now have a powerful ally in President Obama, who has used the Newtown massacre to urge congressional action on gun violence for the first time in his White House tenure.
""I'd like to get it done in the first year,"" Obama said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program Sunday.
Obama has appointed Vice President Biden to head a new task force assigned to come up with concrete proposals to curb gun violence, looking not only at gun laws but also the mental health system and violence-in-culture issues.
Biden is expected to lend the task force's recommendations this month. 
""This is not something that I will be putting off,"" Obama vowed Sunday.
The gun-control proponents have a tough fight ahead. Not only has the National Rifle Association (NRA) come out strongly against new gun laws since the Newtown shooting, but Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have also been quick to reject the notion that tougher gun restrictions will prevent violent people from shooting others.
""We’re going to take a look at what happened there [in Newtown] and what can be done to help avoid it in the future,"" Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which oversees gun laws, told Roll Call last month. ""But gun control is not going to be something that I would support.""
The Democrats don't seem to be deterred, and they see Thursday's proposal, which would ban magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, as one of their best chances to rein in gun violence. 
""While there is no single answer to stopping these massacres, this bill is a step that will go a long way toward making our country safe,"" DeGette said.
Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) is expected to introduce similar legislation in the upper

The second one i have is a slightly used Stag lower with a DPMS lower kit and a UTG 6 position stock. Barreled upper is also a take off from a Bushmaster I purchased new. Rifling is perfect as well on this 1 in 9 twist 16 inch barrel. It does have a flash hider however it does not have a bayonet lug. There is a pretty gnarly scratch on the upper but it's only in the anodized coating and can't be felt with your finger. More of a rub mark from stuffing too many rifles in my crowded safe. Both come with a 30 round mag with green followers. I would like to sell both as a package for $2000.00 but would separate for $1200 on each. I'm not interested in trades.

It will come with 4x metal 30rd magazines and somewhere around 150rds of Silver Bear 7.62x39. 

Willing to sell out of state following all legal paths. Ship to FFL after I receive a copy of their license. Unfortunately shipping ammo is an immense pain so I will not be including the ammo with any out of state purchase. 

Not really looking for any trades at this time, mostly cash - however I could do a partial cash+ .223/5.56 ammo trade if you want to knock some off the price. Open to negotiations.

PLEASE make offers upfront. With the hectic surge of buying I'm receiving a lot of responses, but making an offer will let me know where you stand on it and I can meet up with those accordingly. Thanks!"

The “Match” is loaded with the same high quality features you’ll find on other Elite series pistols. Custom features include a 4 3/4 ” match grade barrel, single action trigger with over travel stop, adjustable rear sights, interchangeable front sight posts, extended safety, extended magazine release, hart shaped hammer, and custom two tone finish.

This is a very low milage rifle in like new condition. It runs perfect and has a co-witness with the red dot. Take the whole package today Face to face. I will ship on your dime WITHOUT the ammo, but would really rather sell it FTF. It will go to the gunshow this weekend. This very nice AR will sell at my FIRM price. I will consider offers on the Nikon/Wilson mount. Thanks for looking."

Barrel is cryo treated for better patterning, and it also has the nice accu-stock on it for reducing recoil, and the gun comes with two cryo-chokes I have purchased (ic, mod) and the wrench to swap them. I have over $600 in this gun alone and that does not include the $50 each choke cost me and the wrench as well and I have only taken it out a couple times so I believe $550 is more then fair, it has been shot so little that it still looks like your looking down a mirror when you look down the barrel. I can also include a couple boxes of 3.5"" magnum shells as well which will save you around $50 (mixed blindside and remington ultra-steel) Thanks for looking.

This gun features:

Vortex flash hider
6 position collapsible stock

FMK lower w/ DPMS internals & DPMS stock.

I LOVE the FMK lower receivers... is all I've used on builds for a while unless someone wanted something specific (like an AR 10 build). Every one I've built are nice tight fits. They got it right!

Used AR's in the Navy & Army & prefer the lightest firearm possible... though I really prefer 30 cal. Better penetration through cover... but is another story. Researched building AR's & many poly lowers. FMK is, hands down, the best I've spec'd. Is what I used for all of mine & my friends - many ex military & were skeptical until they ran round after round through them - 5.56 & 7.62. Built a 50 for a friend in WV & while it worked fine, it was a bit light for the gun... he said it felt top heavy.  Go figure!

This is the last one I have... I've never gouged a soul - I have $200 in parts in this build & asking price is what I asked for them prior to all the hub-ub. Has been mounted & checked for fit but never live fired: is NEW.

Will even throw in a Tapco 30 round p-mag (5.56) for an extra $25. Yep - not $57.95 like the store down my street...

I have a 2007 Suzuki GSX-R 600 for sale. 12,400 Miles (Near mint Condition) I can no longer ride due to my Disability, hate to see her go. 

Its the most desirable color combination, Near mint Condition, Has a few, very very small blemishes here and there from normal use. She runs very strong never had any problems with her at all. Always garaged and stored properly, This bike runs amazing, looks amazing and handles amazing.

Take a ride on the GSX-R600 and you'll quickly become aware of a highly developed sporting tool. On a particular solo run on the Gixxer, the man/machine interface was direct and inspirational, not wanting of a dollop more power or a scintilla of a quicker flick. Its available power is plentiful and the gearbox and slipper clutch works seamlessly at the command of your fingers and toes. The twisty road ahead is consumed to the accompaniment of a beautiful scream from the injected Four. It's difficult to imagine an experience much better.

And the other bad this is the gun shoots but every few shots the spent case wont eject all the way, i am no gunsmith but honestly i think it just needs someone to give it a better cleaning job than i must have gave it. I got it from a gun show like 6 years ago and it would do it almost every shot but i cleaned it and now you can shoot all 15 rounds and it only will jam about 3 times out of that so i think if someone had more patience and time than i have to really tear it down and give it a better cleaning it will shoot fine, but like i said i am not gunsmith..    face to face deals only"

I will be teaching a small class on January 14th in a private home in Arapahoe County and I am currently accepting up to 3 more students. There are currently 2 women and 1 gentleman signed up, and maximum class size will be 6. This is a perfect opportunity for you or your wife or girlfriend to get her certificate in a low stress, low testosterone environment.
The class is based upon the NRA Orientation to the Pistol, and range qualification will take place at a private club nearby. This is not a tactical class, rather an introduction to the skills, knowledge and attitude needed to own and shoot a specific firearm model safely, and fulfills the State Requirements for Concealed Handgun training.
Pistol, targets, ammo, ear and eye protection as well as range fees are all included so there are no additional costs.
I reserve the right to do business or not with whomever I choose, and I am selective about who I certify.
Please respond by clicking ""contact seller"" and provide your name, age and phone number and best time to contact you to discuss enrolling in the class."
