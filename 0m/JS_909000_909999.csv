$450.00 OBO 
An older, but very well kept Pedersoli Kentucky Rifle. This was an unshot domestic wallhanger until I bought it, and I have put less than 20 rounds through it. It's a single trigger, has great spark, and a new vent liner with two shots through it. 13/16"" barrel, with 33"" length. Lightweight but good shooter. I am sorry I dont know if it is 1:48 or 1:66 twist. It has a dovetail v-notch rear and teardrop front sight, both shined brass. They are the only brass that has been shined. The rest has been left how I got it, with a nice patina on it. No rust on the barrel, the stock is well oiled, and has very few handling marks."

An older used T/C Hawken rifle (serial# 76926). The barrel is clean, the bore is bright, and the only rust is on the tang where the previous owner had a peep mounted. 29"" long 15/16"" barrel. The stock has the usual nicks and handling marks of a hunting rifle. It has a new ramrod (a lil tight and could use a bit of sanding), a currently installed front bead sight, and spare blade sight to go with the gun. It also has sling mounts on the buttstock and inner thimble."

Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel junk (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $2-$4 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 27 boxes available.  Price is $20/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

ONLY 223 ammo I've seen in a retail store in the last couple weeks was $30 for 20, and there were only a handful of those even left.

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. 5 box minimum on orders I have to ship."

The The V50SS-300 rifle features a massive SAE 4150 receiver and a three lug bolt with a 60-degree bolt throw, cock on opening action, a shell holder type extractor for absolutely positive extraction, and a machined aircraft grade aluminum stock. The barrel is machined from ordnance grade, chrome moly, high vanadium steel hardened to Rc 28-32. The barrel is 30” long, has 8 grooves, 1-15” right hand twist and features a SAAMI spec chamber which will allow the use of any SAAMI spec ammo. The barrel and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished for long lasting good looks and corrosion protection. The V50SS utilizes the time proven standard, '98 Mauser trigger system for absolute safety. This rifle also features a high efficiency ""shark fin"" muzzle break, machined from solid bar stock and threaded on to the muzzle of the barrel with 1-12 TPI threads. This muzzle break is designed to reduce felt recoil to that of a 12 ga. Shotgun. The muzzle break can be “Tuned” to the barrel by altering the length via the long thread shank. This feature allows the operator to find the “sweet spot” for the break that gives the best accuracy. An M1913 Picatinny scope rail is attached via oversized grade 8 allen screws for easy mounting of optics. The oversized recoil shoulder distributes the recoil over a large surface area affording rock solid mounting to the stock. The bolt has three huge locking surfaces and a 60 degree throw. It features a “primary extraction” cam for positive extraction of the case. The receiver is machined from bar stock SAE 4150 steel and features pressure release vents for BOTH case separation and primer pierce, making this one of the strongest, safest actions available. We have tested these actions and bolts to pressures exceeding 100,000 psi with no evidence of failure. The stock is machined from aircraft aluminum bar stock. This stock is made to machine tool tolerances and is completely impervious to climate and temperature. It is attached to an aluminum buttstock with a shock absorbing recoil to further reduce felt recoil and allow the shooter to comfortably shoot all day. 

A bipod mounting rod is threaded into the stock, securing the oversized recoil shoulder and locking the recoil shoulder to the stock for increased accuracy. A heavy-duty M14 type bipod is also included in this package. This bipod is constructed of heavy duty STEEL, not aluminum, as are other bipods. This bipod will hold up to heavy duty use! It features adjustable steel legs, which adjust for length, a baked on black enamel finish for long lasting corrosion protection, an allen screw lock, and it folds up for transport.

This is a strong, good running truck, that has always performed well for me. It is wired for trailer lights and brakes. I use it often for towing skid steers. There is some minor rear fender damage from a blow out. Also the tailgate has some issues, but I have a new one painted to match that goes with the truck. The photos were taken before the new tires were installed, so they are not pictured. I also have an extra set of wheels and tires that can go for additional $$.

Description:
The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine.  It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine.  First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel.  Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds.  Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine.  Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. 

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

Great truck, but don't need the off road or first responder ability and have been doing mostly long distance highway driving lately, looking to get a Sedan possibly '06 or new Audi, possibly interested in a trade.


Vehicle is equipt with:
 After market Tuffy steel locking tool boxes replacing the stock plastic compartments in the bed.

Steel combination locking safe in Center console.

ARB Front bumper with fog lights.

Torrent 360 Amber/Red Light bar with alley and take down lights.
 (light bar can be used Amber for utility work, or red for emergency response) light bar is completely programmable and light modules can be changed if you prefer different colors. I have videos of the light bar on youtube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWegg4iXu0I

Soundoff signal 385R Remote Dual tone siren (two Federal 100W speakers , echoing siren) control unit runs light bar and rear window lights,
Wiring as far as the control module goes doesn't look pretty, wired it in my drive way last year in the middle of winter just to get it working and never went back to make it look pretty, module is mounded behind the rear drivers side seat. All wiring to the battery is finished all wrapped in 3M tape and run correctly though the fire wall with factory wires and under rocker panels.  Wires for light bar pass through the rain gutter and are sealed, if you want to remove the light bar the holes can be plugged and a new rain gutter seal will cover the holes, additional screws for bracket go inside the doors and not visible unless the doors are opened.

Rear window has two Phanton split red/white light affixed to the rear window

Front dash has a small scratch the runs down onto the radio panel, I have a replacement panel.
Additional ARB wiring components for mounting a winch.
I have two Red/White strobes for front bumper but need new running light turn signal lamps for the ARB bumper to put them in.

Major repairs,
belts pulleys and battery (sand got in it some how)
Radiator, front bumper and support (drunk driver slid on ice into me, very low speed) now replaced with ARB, the stock bumper i have is what they repaired it with, not the factory original, looks the same though.
Front wheel bearing, rear bearing and just had break work done so everything is new, and two new tires.


This is a awesome truck but I am a disabled veteran and haven't been working and could use some extra cash, been doing lots of driving lately and just looking to get a car, don't really need the truck, and now that I live in CO I dont want to take the lights and siren off after the work of putting them on so rather just sell it and hope someone else can get some use out of it.  Its a great truck, fun to drive, lights and siren work great, dual sirens and loud and sound awesome! Email me with any questions.

These magazines are super-hard to get, and Magpul has over 1-million currently on backorder (over 9 months supply at normal production levels).

This is an excellent pistol. I own the USP and the USP compact as well and this is a SIGNIFICANT upgrade to be sure. Excellent ergonomics-this is a smooth and safe platform. The compact size is comparable to a midsize Glock such as a 19 or 23 (though lightyears ahead in performace capability) in that it is perfect for either duty or concealed carry. I am certainly not in a hurry to give away this pistol but im always curious as to what else is out there so if you have something comparable, show me what im missing out on!  Roughly 350 rounds have left the barrel without a single failure to fire. The pistol would come with all original paperwork and tools, as well as the case and all interchangeable backstraps that came with the original purchase. The three magazines all come with floorplates, two are 12 rounders and one is 10. If you have any additional questions I would be happy to answer them.

I have a couple rules to go along with any possible trade offers. I will not trade this gun down, which means no offers for your firearm plus cash--im only looking to trade this pistol straight across, or a possiblity of a small amount of cash on my side. All interactions will take place via e-mail until final arrangements are made to meet.

Thanks for looking, and dont be afraid to send an offer-the worst I can say is no, but thank you."

I just got the pistol a couple months ago, but only used it once..
It had no FTF or FTEs,shot about 150 rounds flawlessly.Of 6 different kinds.
Cleaned it before and after i shot it.Very accurate sweet plinker..
A good first gun by far, Im just looking to get a CC handgun.
Anyways It comes with 5 Smart Reloader 100 round cases(New) worth $12 and 120 rounds of various types including Viper,CCI Velocitor,American Eagle,Winchester Varmint..Also comes with a brand new Sightmark Sureshot Reflex Sight(Red Dot)worth $50.It has 4 different patterns in red and brightness adjustment to from 1-7..
Also comes with microfiber cleaning cloth and rubber cover for lens.Also paper packaging that came with it..Also comes with a HKS .22 Speed Loader(worth $5)
The gun comes just like new with Beretta hard case and CA certified lock and 2 mags also all paperwork.
So originally the gun is $250 w/tax=around $275 w/backgroundcheck = $300
The Red Dot is $50 w/tax=around $54
The HKS Loader is $5 something w/tax
and the Smart Reloader Cases equal out to about $13

So thats about $370 worth and only asking $300 flat for it..
It's all new and ready to go.Contact me with any further questions.
