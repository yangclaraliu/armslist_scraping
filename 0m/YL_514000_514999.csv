Included is the Harris (non-swiveling) bipod, a cheapie sling, one detachable box magazine, and I can probably scrounge a box or two of FGGM's that I will no longer need as it is my only .308.

Generic info on FN SPR's per FN's website:


FN Special Police Rifles (SPR) are based on the legendary Pre-’64 Model 70-design action with a massive external claw extractor for Controlled Round Feed, blade ejection, the original twolever trigger and a three-position safety. All models have cold hammer-forged MIL -SPEC barrels with hard-chromed bores, and are held to +/- .001"" headspace to produce and maintain one minute of angle (1 MOA ) accuracy, making them natural choices for long-range target shooting and competition. A one-piece steel MIL -STD 1913 rail with an additional 20 MOA of elevation is factory-installed. FN SPR rifles are fitted into matte black McMillan™ fiberglass stocks. Both cheekpiece height and length of pull are fully adjustable on FN SPR A5M models."

This particular rifle was built by Citizens Armory down at Mexico, MO on a like new polish AK kit on a Tapco flat receiver. This rifle has an original Polish chrome lined barrel and of course is all matching. This rifle is NOT a century built using US made barrels and the quality of built is way better than anything Century puts out

Thompson Center Hawkens Muzzel Load Rifle - New – Test Fired Only 

History
In 1815 Jacob Hawken established a gun shop in the village of St. Louis. Jacob’s brother, Samuel, joined him in 1822. The Hawken brothers established a reputation for manufacturing excellent Muzzleloading Rifles. Their claim to fame was the ""plains rifles"". The Plains Rifle was what their customers needed when they ascended the Missouri River in search of Beaver, a quality gun, light enough to carry all the time and capable of knocking down big targets at long range.

They called their Rifles ""Rocky Mountain Rifles"". Rifles Stamped “J&S Hawken St. Louis” were sought after throughout the rapidly expanding frontier among trappers and mountain men. In 1849 Jacob Hawken died and rifles were marked S. Hawken. A number of famous men were said to have owned Hawken Rifles, including: Jim Bridger, Kit Carson, Joseph Meek and Theodore Roosevelt.

Undoubtedly the most copied rifle in the history of firearms, the T/C Hawken was designed for the American shooter. This is a top quality firearm—every bit as fine as the one your great, great granddaddy carried across his saddle pommel or packed along on the wagon train. It captures the romance of the original but it is manufactured to standards of quality control that were unheard of in the early 1800’s. The proper use of the investment casting, improved methods of hardening parts and deep hole drilling, the use of continuous Magnaflux process to guard against imperfections in the steel itself coupled to our constant attention to min./max. tolerances is what allows us to offer a lifetime Warranty! Thompson Center arms manufacture the finest quality muzzleloading firearms available.

It has a double triggers; the rear trigger is a ""set"" trigger. When the rear trigger is pulled, the hammer does not fall but rather the action ""sets"" the front trigger, the front trigger becoming a ""hair trigger,"" tripped with a light touch. When the front trigger is used without using the rear ""set"" trigger, it requires a firm pull.

3in barreled pro series .38/.357 with front stock night sight. this gun has less than 300 flawless rounds through it. no dings dents or scratches. I have very carefully added green testors to the top of the sight to make target acquisition quicker, its easily removed with solvent. comes with stock wood grips and hogue wrap around rubber grips which makes shooting 357 out of this enjoyable and .38 seems like .22 Mag... Also included is a really nice sourdough silver dollar pancake holster with IWB loops. also
including a safariland comp2 loader and 2 bianchi speed strips
Oh and one last thing: the goofy ILS system has been professionally disabled. the post was ground off and all parts reinstalled by a gunsmith.
it's a great gun Just too big in size for what I need it to be"

This is a BULGARIAN AK 74 parts kit with all matching numbers.  I have two trigger group systems, one regular G2 and the other is a FULL AUTO.  The full auto fire control group is 100% legal and will function as a semi auto only, so long as you don't drill the two holes in the receiver.  This is a cool legal loophole if you are into the SHTF preparation. The Bulgarian 74s are much much better quality than the Polish and Russian.  I have assembled a few of these over the years and they are easy and very forgiving, just a bit time consuming.  Expect 5 to 6 hours of labor on your first time.  It is an easy build, just time consuming if you do it right.  Also this kit has all of the legal US parts and a new barrel.  Most kits that you see online do not have these parts (you end up spending 150+ to get), are usually missing the barrel (100+ as well), and don't have the matching numbers.  I am not trying to make money off of this deal, just clearing my project list up. But if you do build this, you can easily sell Bulgarian AK74s for 8-900.  Check it out on Gunbroker
There are also about 400 rounds of ammo for it included in the deal.  The 5.45x39 is much more fun to shoot in my opinion than the 7.62x39 and is a wicked round."

This ia a collectible Beretta 92F 9MM FBI National Academy Graduate Model. Graduates were offered an opportunity to purchase these Beretta 92F which has gold inlay, and FBINA seals imbedded in the grips. It is in an Oak case with a glass presentation lid with, embedded, etched seal in the glass. Case has a lock and key. This gun has never been fired. This belonged to a friend that graduated and later sold it to me. It has been sitting in my safe for the last several years and I have decided to sell to put it in the hands of a serious collector. I also have the original cardboard Beretta box that it was shipped in. The later issue ones did not include the wood case and was replaced with the standard plastic case. These are very rare but do show up from time to time. Additional pictures can be supplied upon request. What may appear to be wear on the magazine shown is light reflection. $1895.00 cash face to face sale. I feel that the price is fair considering one sold on one of the auction sites for $2200.00

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gun sight (ACOG) designed for the M16A4 Weapon system (20” barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self- luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

Has had the extractor replaced as well as a little bit of polishing done to some of the internals (mostly the feed ramp, also a little for a smoother trigger pull) and has Pachmayr grips on it. Comes with a compensated barrel bushing as well as the stock one, 2 factory 8rd mags and an extended 10rd mag. I'm looking to trade it, would be interested in other handguns especially revolvers. May be interested in tactical shotguns or military long guns as well. Would consider a 10/22 or a .17 bolt gun. I also have a couple of GI mags and a limited amount of cash to add for the right trade and will take cash to make up the difference as well. Thanks"

The 639 is a super reliable and practically indestructable 9mm pistol. The stainless steel frame minimizes recoil. Full length 4"" barrel. Single stack is perfect for smaller hands. This is a 2nd Generation Smith with the BEST trigger I've ever experienced on a Smith. DA/SA with decocker and mag safety. Adjustable rear sight.  Has a beautiful set of custom cocobolo grips on it, and comes with the original wood grips as well as Pachmyer rubber grips. Comes with 4 8-rd magazines total. I will even throw in my last 50rd box of Winchester Ranger T-series.

Looks great aside from a few small scratches next to the slide stop/takedown pin from the prior owner.  I would call it Excellent condition overall.  I fired 100 rounds of assorted HP at the range without a single issue. Good grouping at 30 feet. Very solid and reliable pistol. This is an early version with the rounded trigger guard.

The early version of the 639 is widely considered to be the best 9mm S&W ever made.  It was manufactured only 2 years and they do not come up for sale very often.  Later versions with the squared trigger guard and ambi decocker are of lesser quality.  This is one of the best 9mm pistols you can own, and I will regret parting with it."

I built this rifle to be an all-around tactical rifle. It groups very nicely at 1.5"" at 100 yds and could do better if the barrel was free-floating. The trigger is crisp and light. Then twist the rifle slightly counter-clockwise and you're staring through the red-dot for CQB. It functions flawlessly and has been well cared for. I'm asking $900 obo or $700 without the optics."
