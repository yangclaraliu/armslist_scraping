Mid-length gas system and 16"" chrome lined barrel. Spikes are known for being super reliable and accurate rifles out of the box with great fit and finish, and there is a long waiting list to get your hands on one. They are highly desirable and thats why it takes forever to get a new one and they are selling for over $2000 right now on gunbroker. This is not some walmart bushmaster or dpms, each and every Spikes rifle is built by craftsmen with tight quality control and attention to detail. You will find absolutely zero negative comments about them anywhere and they are the choice of many law enforcement officers that are in the know. Dont take my word for it, research it yourself and read some reviews. Kills me to sell it now after it finally came in only a month ago but I desperately need the cash for another vehicle and that is the only reason why I am even considering it. I would also consider trades up or down with cash on your part or mine for a decent reliable and fuel efficient vehicle. Prefer something like a toyota truck but open to any offers, just depends on what you have. Looking to work with someone to come up with an arrangement that satisfies us both, or just sell the rifle outright. If you have an extra vehicle you dont need that doesnt have any serious problems and want to get yourself a higher end AR without spending a dime, maybe we can make a deal that helps us both out."

The rifle has a detachable 5 round box magazine, that is flush with the stock when inserted.   The bolt acts on a 70 degree turn to allow the use of a scope. Another feature of this gun I enjoy is that the safety is right on the tang/thumb rest for easy access for left and right handed shooters.  This would be a great hunting rifle or long range target rifle.  There are few calibers that you can easily get such a wide range of ammunition for.

#4 Gun and No mags.  $450

Like I said a few different options.  The price is solid and I will not take less.  I don't have to sell it.  The mags alone will keep going up.  I can give you links to my perfect feedback on Gunbroker and other sites.  

I will NOT ship and will only meet in Cary or Apex.  Must complete bill of sale and have NC CC permit. Gun is still for sale if ad is up.  Might consider trades or partial trades.

I would like a Gen4 19 in FDE, an OD 19 or a 19 23 with Gills on slide."

The stock is in very good shape with some minor use marks. The metal finish is near perfect. It has the standard stripper clip fed 10 round internal magazine.  Sharp all matching original serial number on bolt carrier, bolt assembly, receiver cover, trigger guard and magazine cover, and on the rifle stock. What's interesting on this SKS is the stamp on the receiver ""CCCP"". This is the first Russian SKS I've seen that has a ""CCCP"" stamp on it. I think this rifle is actually a Russian Govt. Issue but not 100% sure due to the fact that I dont consider my self an expert. Also has a nice, clean, and unsharpened bayonet. Overall it's a nice Russian Tula SKS and great for collectors.

Also included is an ammo can with 358 rounds of federal XM855 ammo on stripper clips, and a wall mount.  This rifle has had 62 rounds through it, hence the odd number of rounds in the can.  No issues at all with anything, short of a lack of time to go to the range.  Truth be told, I have virtually no expectations out of the red dot.  It was dirt cheap and meant to give me an idea of if I would be more comfortable with an aimpoint, or an eotech type reticle.

Spikes Tactical currently has an 8 month back order log.  Federal ammunition is also back ordered.  With the potential for a new weapons ban, what do you expect... hence the price.  I honestly don't care much if this sells or not, but since everything is flying off the shelves, it is a sellers market.

Each desert digital receiver set will come with one new 30rd PMag in Flat Dark Earth color.  
**UPDATE: Only have one lower/upper receiver set left**  The black lower you see in the pic is a billet tactical innovations multi caliber lower.  Dont think I will get rid of that one unless I get a really good trade offer for it.  I have a few FDE Pmags I could throw in to sweeten the deal.  They are brand new.

Really great rifle and a real shooter; holds tighter than me at the bench. You WILL be very happy with how tight this groups (I have had best luck with 75 grain Hornady steel match ammo).
The triggers on the 556 line of Sig rifles is superb.

I'm quite happy with this rifle and honestly don't NEED to sell it but if WASRs are selling for over $1,200 in the current environment.....I have to imagine there is someone out there that actually wants a quality firearm.

Last week there was a black plain-Jane Sig 556 posted asking $4000, it's a sellers market and the ""gun-environment"" is pretty crazy right now.  If you think the price is too high feel free to make me a counter offer if you are serious.

It was chronographed over 4,000 f.p.s and grouped better than 1/2 m.o.a..  The trigger on the rifle is very light/crisp.  The metal is a satin stainless steel, and the wood a black laminate on a thumbhole stock. For a flat out trade on a good AR I will include a Burris 6x18 scope.  The muzzle has a trophy crown for improved accuracy, and the forend is vented to allow the heavy bull barrel to cool quicker when you're in the thick of it.  Also, this gun has an operable floor plate which makes it nice to unload after you've cleared the farm of critters.
Along with this rifle comes RCBS dies and approximate 150 pcs of once-fired brass.  I have about 20 rds of loaded ammo still as well.  Original box and paperwork comes with it too.
I love this gun and would like to hang on to it, but like everyone else in the country right now, I need an AR-15 and money is tight after Christmas.
I would trade this rifle and the extras for an AR 15 (.223/5.56).  I would also consider a trade for the right 1911.  
If you're interested in this rifle and have asomething along these lines as trade I would love to hear from you at REDACTED (text or call).

12 gauge, 5+1 capacity, 
fixed cylinder bore, 
3"" chamber, 18"" chrome-lined barrel, aircraft aluminum machined receiver, 
13 3/4"" pull stock.
 It is an improvement on the Winchester 1200/1300 design (rotating bolt mechanism). I liked it because the stock fit me, the controls were the best, and it is light and well-balanced. The comb on a bead-sighted Remington 870 is too high for me. The comb on the SXP is just right and the slightly shorter 13 3/4"" pull also fits me better. The comb has very little rise for less cheek slap on recoil. The recoil pad is very soft and energy absorbing."
