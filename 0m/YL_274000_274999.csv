1. I have a like new Jewell Trigger for an AR-15 for sale. The trigger was installed in my varmint rifle for 150rds and is without a doubt the best trigger I have ever felt in an AR.

218,http://www.armslist.com/posts/274218,Want To Buy:  Hunting Rifle,"Auburn, Alabama, United States",$ 200,"Listed On: Wednesday, January 11, 2012",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Would love a 30-06, but will take .270 or other calibers. No youth guns. I prefer synthetic stock but if you have a wood stock and it is on a nice gun and i can purchase a synthetic stock for it, that will work. Rifle needs to have a good scope on it. 

Would be very interested in a Tikka, Howa, or Remington 770, or Remington 700. But let me know what you have.

I am also buying ammo, 7.62by39, .223/5.56, 9mm, .40, or 30-30. also law enforcement 12 gauge shells. 

I have a nice vertical grip with built in pressure swich and storage compartment that is new, a camo gun sling with shell holders, and a camo soft gun case i will add to the right trade for gun or trade for ammo.
I also have a night vision monocular that works really well that is practically new and in the case that i may be willing to trade for a really nice hunting rifle. This is not for sell, only trade."

It has undergone evolutionary changes that resulted as engineering and tooling changed, but the basic gun remains. And it has always been the ""anchor"" of the S&W line. Known originally as the .38 Military and Police Model, it is built on what now is known as the ""K"" frame of the Smith & Wesson series of frames. Since it's inception it's purpose has been a ""duty"" gun... one that would be used in what is tenderly known as ""close range interpersonal confrontations"". It has been cussed by some, praised by some, and ignored by many. Yet it is a solid performer and will do it's duty in the hands of someone who knows what it is to 'see the elephant'."

 “Back boring means less choke constriction.   As you open up the bore of a shotgun it takes less choke constriction to still get the same pattern as one with a standard bore. This is a big bonus to all that love to shoot trap and other sporting clay games because this puts more pellets into the center mass of the shot string and over all shortens the shot string reducing the time frame from first pellet strike to the last.”

These are signal, distress, hand combo flare and smoke. These are emergency signaling devices. On one side is orange smoke for daytime use. On the other side is an extremely bright flare for nightime use. These would be great for almost any outdoor activity including; camping, hunting, boating, RVing, traveling, etc.. To activate either end requires pulling a ring, which breaks a seal, which in turn ignites the signaling device. Also these signaling devices come in a airtight, watertight, military grade aluminum container. 1 single signal for $6 or 12 for $60+a free container which is an awesome storage vessel in itself. Empty containers are $5/each & seem far superior to those old green army ammo containers. REDACTED"

The gun is is good shape.  If fires, however, it doesn't feed correctly all the time.   (2) Ithaca Model 72 22 caliber lever-action.  It doesn't fire with the ammo I have and doesn't seem to feed all that great either.  (3) Sears Model 44DLM 22 mag caliber lever-action.  It is a non-hammer type lever action made by Marlin for Sears.  It fires, but doesn't feed correctly either.  I do have a new feed throat assembly for this gun, which should repair it.  All 3 guns are tube-fed and still have good rifling.  I was going to fix them and sell them but I thought someone might want them as projects to tinker with.  I'm looking for the best offer over $200 and would sell them without hesitation for $250.  That price is for all 3 guns together.  I would also be open to trades.  You can reach me at REDACTED.

The only mods to this guitar are- Schaller strap locks, Sheptone Blue Sky pickups ($259 new) and I switched the knobs out with Gibson OEM replacements. I am more than happy to take detailed pictures if needed. 

Description of the Blue Sky pickups- (pickups are serialized, I have the box and paperwork they came with)
""This set was built to emulate the tone of Dickey Betts' famous Goldtop in a modern Les Paul. Alnico 4 Magnets and a different coil offset were selected to attain the ""drier"" tone of these specific pickups.
 These pickups are built with bobbins molded from ACTUAL PAF bobbins, accurate nickel-silver baseplates stamped exclusively for Sheptone that were reverse-engineered from originals with real tool marks. Most every part of these pickups has been fabricated here at my shop, or exclusively for Sheptone to ensure the most accurate PAF replica available.""



Cash or trade value is $1500. To buy this guitar with these pickups new would cost you about $2200. Shipping is extra. I live in the Greenville, NC area but will split the difference on travel as long as it's reasonable."

The neat thing about TNW guns is that this 1919 is composed of genuine US WWII parts so besides the right plate, it is all correct WWII machine gun. It semi-automatic and is considered a rifle and is legal to own without a Class III license.  The gun is a blast to fire and with some of the crank fire mechanisms on the market, you can fire it as fast as a full auto.  Right now it is set up for early WWII configuration and it uses a canvas ammo belt (it can be easily converted to use metal links, which are included).  Included with the gun is one 125 round canvas belt that has only been loaded twice, (it was new old stock when I got it), a GI disassembly tool, a GI pintle, a 1969 dated GI  manual, a bag of metal links, a early WWII steel .30 caliber ammo can, as well as other printed info on the gun. Also included is a reproduction M2 tripod that is constructed with solid steel legs.  The originals have hollow legs so this one is plenty heavy duty and looks like the original model.  The gun is in great condition as has a teen number 2 digit serial number.  If you are looking for a TNW gun, they are now harder to find because TNW announced that they will no longer be making these.  If you have any questions or need further information, please email me."

Battlegrip Model BGV-QDK

After years of searching for the ultimate Quick Detach method for our vertical grips, TangoDown has teamed with American Defense to bring you the best vertical grip yet.

Some weapon systems and mission profiles require a quick detach/attach method for vertical grips and other components. Ideally, this design would require a wide range of adjustment to fit MIL-STD spec and out-of-spec rails. It would also require no tools for rapid, accurate adjustment in the harshest field conditions. It would also be bombproof and light as possible.

That grip is now available. The BGV-QD series vertical grip.. the latest evolution of our combat-tested and proven BGV-series of vertical grips.

The BGV-QD series features an ADM U.S. Patent Pending throw lever system that is steps above anything else available to operators. First, the throw lever locks in place when installed, and cannot be inadvertently unlocked, if caught on web gear, slings, etc. A simple push button releases the throw lever from the locked position allowing lightning fast attachment or removal when you decide.

Next, the adjustment system for fitting ANY type of rail, from authentic MIL-STD 1913 to commercial Weaver type is KISS compliant. Adjustment is accomplished in a flash, with no tools. It is simple, elegant, light and strong. No more fumbling for wrenches that may–or- may not be in your kit while you’re on a mountain top in Afghanistan. All hardware is TYPE III hard coat anodized, or given an anti-glare black Melonite coating for superior corrosion protection.

The BGV-QD series grips still feature the best heat and impact modified polymers that money can buy. Our proprietary formulated resins take combat abuse in stride, and complete the mission every time without fracturing or shattering from impact, common with some other brands. All BGV series grips are injection molded from fiberglass-reinforced resin, not machined from un-reinforced brittle delrin, for the utmost in strength. Our grips are designed for use on M4s all the way to 7.62mm belt fed SAWs, and routinely pass 6’ drop tests on these weapon systems. The BGV-MK46 vertical grip is one of only two vertical grips in the US Military inventory, awarded NSN # 1010-01-536-4707.

BGV-QD series grips also retain our O- ring protected internal storage cavity, good for depths of 66 feet. This cavity allows for easy access storage of weapon spares, batteries and other combat essential items. 

The BGV-QDK grip is the optimum choice for breaching shotguns, M4s, CQB systems such as the MK18..any system requiring a compact envelope. The shorter length also lends itself to vehicle use, or tight operating environments. The BGV-QDK is available in black, flat dark earth and foliage green.

As always, every Tangodown product is proudly designed, tooled and produced here in the United States of America. Our mission still remains to provide the finest possible kit to the U.S. Warfighter.

There is some slight wear on the front of the slide. The rest of the gun is in very good condition considering its vintage. It was made in Germany and imported by Inter-arms. I have only fired one box of ammo through it and it fired flawlessly. 

They no longer make this pistol any more and these German made ones are a nice collectable as well as a reliable and accurate shooter. This the ""PP"" version which barrel and slide is slightly longer than the ""PPK"" version and I havent seen as many ""PP"" either making myself believe it is slightly more rare. It is easily concealable making it a fantastic CCW especially during the warmer months when clothing is tighter.

Never been into the field. Gun has had 50 rounds put through it for sighting and break-in. Barrel broken according to Kenny Jarrett instructions, as below:

We start with 10 rounds 
Now you shoot one round...no more... break out your cleaning rod and use a good copper solvent...give your barrel a good scrubbing... then you take a second shoot and clean it again... and keep doing that... One shoot then clean your barrel for all ten rounds.... after 6,7,8 rounds you'll stop seeing copper fouling in the rifling... but keep going until you shoot all ten...good cleaning afterwards... 

Now you continue shooting... cleaning between every 2 shots... once you've shot 30 you should be good but I do all 50, just to make sure... 

I use Federal Vital Shok 165gr BTSX. Gun will come with 4 boxes of this as well.**If you were to pay someone to do this correctly, it would cost hundreds of dollars.

This is a $900 gun, with $200 of ammo. Looking for $900 for all of it."

I have three Springfield Armory  XD/XDm 45 magazines with Canyon Creek extensions, springs, and followers; 18+1 capacity.  These are 140mm and are USPSA/IDPA legal.  I sold the gun, so no need for these.  The extension kits are over $50 each with shipping, so you are getting the magazines for free.  Comes with original basepads and springs.  Only shot 3 or 4 USPSA matches with them, so the springs are still like new.

I will also include 3 Mach 2 Tactical mag pouches.....

Here is a link to the extensions....
