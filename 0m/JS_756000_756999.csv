If you are not familiar with the PWS MK107 Diablo, then google it and read about it...this is one badazz gun. Very accurate, very fun to shoot, and definitely very obnoxious at an indoor range which I do not recommend unless you like pissing people off next to you. The muzzle blast creates a small fireball and is very very loud...louder than my .50 cal AR...the people in the lane next to me at the indoor range I was at had their paper target 10-15yds down range and every time I'd fire the Diablo, the energy from the muzzle blast would blow off and rip their target off the hinges...so it's not an indoor range type of gun...they don't call it the Diablo for nothing I guess. Under 200 rounds fired.

Let me get this right. So you are now a victim because you failed to prepare for what you should have seen coming a long time ago? So you are a victim because you did not invest in firearms, magazines, and ammo rather than the countless video games that I am sure you own? You fault those who had the foresight to invest wisely and prepare for the inevitable. I bet you do not have any food or water reserves either. You expect the government to bail you out of your lack of preparedness.

This is the same mentality that gives government phones to welfare recipients because everyone deserves a phone. Grow up and join the real world. The government cannot always give you free cheese and you cannot have mine.

Bless those who prepared in advance and are willing to share some of their supplies, even if it is for a profit. At least they have some available. I don't see your elected officials handing out guns, ammo, and mags; but if they did I am sure you would be first in line."

Also includes a Leupold 2.5-8x premium handgun scope and Thompson rings and mount. 

It has the extended forend. I have about $1250 invested in the gun. Perfect for long range shooting or for hunting any game in North America out to 150 yards.

The best part? Thompson Encore guns have thousands of interchangeable rifle and pistol barrels available. You can buy other barrels through the mail from 22lr to 20ga, from 17hmr to .375 H&H. Changing a barrel takes 30 seconds.

I'm asking $750 for the gun which is quite a good deal.

The CETME is the 'precursor' to the HK G3 series of rifles, many parts interchange between the two.  I have done a bit of work to this since getting it:  installed new rollers to get the bolt gap in spec, replaced springs, installed a new stock set, and welded on a G3 rear sight assembly.  

The rifle shoots great - I have no problem hitting a 12"" plate at 300 yards which is about the limit of my eyesight.  Barrel condition is pristine - no pitting/etc.  

Rifle comes with approximately 30 magazines (20 round HK surplus), a spare trigger pack for parts, additional grip housing you can clip & pin if you want a steel grip housing, and a claw scope mount (ready for you to attach your own scope).  I have probably 100-150 rounds of ammo for it too that I will throw in as well.  

Like I said - this rifle runs great, I just don't shoot it as much as I would like to.  Face to face in the SE WI area is preferable."

$1350 OBO.  This is less than they are going for on GB and then you have to involve a FFL dealer in the mix.  I can meet for FTF with valid ID.  At the Gun Show in Lexington, the cheaper Sportical Models and Sport (unibody lowers) were selling for 2K plus.

I would be interested in a 6"" barrel to replace mine as it shows some wear on it.  I would also be interested in the belt buckle that was original sold with this package to make my set complete.

I am willing to drive a short distance (hour or so) for the right deal, but if you are willing to ship that would be much better.  The prices I am willing to pay are dependent upon the condition of the barrel and the shroud.

In reponse to some of the offers I have been getting: I am not looking to gouge anyone, thats why I am taking offers. I have always believed that something is worth what someone is willing to pay so consider the possibility that there will be an assault weapons ban and fine weapons like this will be history. I don't care if I sell it or not. I like ARs better anyway but ARs were a dime a dozen when SCARS were hard to find. I want this weapon to go to someone who will value it more than I do so be realistic with your offers..thanks"

Here i have a beautiful 2005 Gibson Les Paul Supreme worth $3500 that is not only legal and will be legal to own but will also appreciate in price as time passes.  They are going for $3000 on ebay and can be bought new on Amazon.com for $3599.

I am looking to do a straight up trade for an AK47+AR15 package.  Everyone knows your $1500 AK is really worth $600 if that only due to the current hype and fear of an impending ban.  This guitar is worth every penny regardless and is certainly not a $200 china fake.

So with the current situation at hand and keeping in mind that things are as they are and people will get their $1500 for their wasr 10/63, i think my offer stands to be in your benefit.  $1500 towards your AK package and $1500 towards your AR package versus my 3000 guitar that you'll be able to get your money back if a ban does come upon us.  Or you can simply put the guitar away in a closet until their worth $10,000 if you wait long enough.

No shipping, FTF only in the Indy area.  I'm 42, i have an Indiana DL, i'm not a felon nor plan to be, and our Indiana constitution does not require an LTCH to own or purchase a long rifle.

I have for sale an unfired Colt LE6920 AR15.  This is the more recently produced 6920, with the Rogers buttstock.  I removed this from the box and put it in my safe -- it has never been fired.  The accessory package that came with it (paperwork, cleaning kit, and two 20-round mags) is included and has not been opened.  

Given the current political climate, I'm not sure how to price this, so I'll let the market decide.  I'm not trying to take advantage of anyone and I don't expect to get $3,000 for it, but I'm not going to sell it for $800 either.  Make an offer that you think is fair, and if I agree, we'll have a deal.

No pics available until I get home tonight, but you all know what they look like.  

IL residents only / must have FOID card and abide by one-day waiting period for rifles.  I will need to see your FOID and will copy the number.  I'll provide a copy of mine as well. Thanks for looking!"

Okay, I tried to be reasonable and open this up to offers, but everybody wants to buy it for $0.40/rd (probably so they can resell it for profit).  Check out ar15.com or gunbroker before submitting your offers.  Even the cheaper American Eagle PMC stuff is selling for $0.60/rd right now.  I am priced at $0.65 since this is the more desirbale Lake City, NATO headstamped ammo with the 62-gr projectile.  Open to REASONABLE offers.  I am willing to split this up (within reason).  If you want 500, I'm sure we can work something out.  If you want 20, you'd better shop somewhere else.

When i got the rifle, i polished all the internals and it smoothed out the action a ton, sometimes these newer Marlins can be a bit tight, but this one is smooth as butter. I installed a Wolfe reduced power spring which reduced the trigger pull and smoothed out the action further. This is a great compact rifle that is a lot of fun to shoot and would be great for deer, bear or larger game. I'll include some factory ammo and some hand loads. i am also interested in selling all my reloading stuff for this caliber which includes:

50x starline brass
about 100 405 gr hard cast boolits
about 70 350 gr fmj boolits
lee die set.

I bought this about this time last year and have used it several times at the range, i've run about 500 rounds through it. It is an excellent, excellent 1911. Its a dramatic step up from entry level 1911's but not as expensive as the higher end customs. it has the classic look, short beavertail, commander skeleton hammer, but has adjustable dovetail from and rear sights. i've had just a bit of smithing done to it, in addition to shooting to break it in, the feed ramp and internals have been polished and it has about a 3.5lb trigger pull. I really believe it is as nice a 1911 as you can get in this price range, especially since the entry level (Rock island etc) are about $100 more expensive than they were this time last year, this is a great value. It comes in its original box with everything, the two original 8 rnd mags, a kimber 8 rnd flush mount mag, and a chip mccormick 10 rnd mag."
