The 6.8 Remington Special Purpose Cartridge was designed by some fine folks in the US military and the Remington Arms Company. The design purpose of this ""special purpose cartridge"" was to make up for the perceived deficiency of the 5.56 NATO round in its role as our standard combat caliber. Often expressed in terms of external ballistics, barrier penetration, knockdown or stopping power, etc., the different measures of performance were to be exceeded with a new AR-15 compatible cartridge From the civilian shooter's point of view, the 6.8 SPC cartridge is a step up from the .223 in one major regard: it is a legal caliber for hunting big game with an AR-15 rifle. For deer and black bear sized game, it is proving to be outstanding in this capacity. For hunting hogs in TX and other areas where hogs are a problem, the 6.8 SPC is second to none."

So the handgun comes with a Safariland paddle holster and two Kimber magazines, one has the little attachment at the bottome the other is slick. Gun is in great condtion, a little holster rub but nothing major on the finish. Pics show some oil from cleaning and care lol.

It's in magnificent condition.  As it is, I've only personally fired around 60 shots through it.  Besides removing the cosmolene and cleaning it after shooting, I haven't tampered with it at all.  I was going to have this as a project gun, turning it into a decent long range shooter by adding a scope and turning the bolt handle, but I've realized that I don't have the know-how to do it myself, and I don't know anyone with whom I would trust enough to mess with a gun that I will be shooting. 


Anyhow, there is lots that you could do with this gun.  Plenty of people sporterize these, add an aftermarket trigger, and attach a scope and bipod (some even cut the barrel), others keep it original as it was a military service rifle.  The bore is clean without any pitting, and the bolt is in pretty awesome condition as well.  The trigger pulls clean and consistent (don't have a load meter to test the lbs of pull), and the sear has a nice sharp edge that keeps the bolt in place even with being banged around.  The rear sight notch is not worn down, it also has the smaller distance increments, and the front sight post is straight and sharp, so you get a great sight picture.  It has what seems to be matching serial numbers in the reciever, bolt, and ammunition tray.


I am looking to sell this for $175 but I would be willing to trade for a bolt action rifle that fires .308 (Remington 700/ Weatherby Vanguard/ Savage 99... you get the picture) or a 12 gauge shotgun (Remington 870 express or Mossberg 500).

These rifles are historically significant as they signify the first breech loading rifles adopted by the US thus making the Cap and Ball musket obsolete. These firearms are fairly scarce as only about 12,000 1864 muskets were converted to the Allin breach loading system. Lock is clearly dated 1864 while breech is dated 1866. This one is all original and in great shape for being close to 150 years old. Metal is in good condition with no pitting or rust and wood is in excellent shape with no cracks and minimal dings and dents. Stock also retains 2 visiable inspectors cartouches as well as a third that is visable but hard to make out. Bore condition is well above average for this type of rifle retaining strong rifling and minimal pitting and still shines fairly well. I have shot this rifle with black powder .50-70 ammo manufactured by Dixie gun works and everything worked as it should even the auto ejector that usually lacks the spring in these early conversion models is present and works properly ejecting the shell out of the chamber with ease. Will consider partial cash/trades for other firearms and am particularly looking for AK 47s and similar type weapons but would like at least $400 cash included In a trade deal. May consider a full trade if deal is enticing enough. Own a true piece of American History and something that has definately seen Civil War use. E-mail, call, or text REDACTED."

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

Features a Nitron®-coated stainless steel slide over a dark hard anodized alloy frame. Hogue® Grips round out this package.

Great pistol, but a bit heavier than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy keeping it as a nightstand piece, but I think I'd prefer a .44 Special or a G36, so I'm putting this up for sale or trade.

As some of you know, the 1006 is widely considered to be the BEST 10mm pistol ever made.  It is more reliable and more durable than the G20, Delta Elite, Bren 10, Kimber, or Dan Wesson.  This is a stainless steel pistol with full length 5"" barrel, adjustable rear sight, and Hogue rubber grips.  Recoil is very manageable with Silvertips, which are considered the best choice for personal defense in this caliber.  Unlike other 10mm pistols, the 1006 is capable of firing very hot (.41 magnum powered) ammunition with stock recoil spring, although if you plan on shooting a lot of +P it is recommended you get a heavier spring if you want to find the brass to reload.

This is a 10 shot, single-stack pistol which is easily grasped by individuals with smaller hands.  DA/SA with hammer spur and ambi decocker.  Comes with 3 factory magazines (valued at $50 each) and approx. 100 rounds of premium ammunition (80 rds Silvertip, 20 rds CorBon Deep Penetrating hunting ammo).  If anyone is interested, I also have a nylon shoulder rig but it is left handed in size S/M.

EXTREMELY LOW ROUND COUNT!!!  Prior owner stated he put less than 200 rounds through it, and I fired 50 rounds to test function.  There is a bit of very minor scuffing on one side that is barely noticeable.  I will call it Excellent condition rather than Mint due to holster wear.

I'd like to get $750 CASH for this, which is a smoking deal when you consider the ammo and spare mags.  I have roughly 950 invested in this package and the pistol alone is worth my asking price so no lowballs please.  Local transaction only.  Will not ship.  No thugs need reply."

Serial #1661xxx (1950)
The owner has lowered the sale price to $325.  He needs to sell this rifle, but he doesn't need to give it away.  This is your chance to own the Winchester 94 Pre-64 30-30.  There will not be any negotiating.  This is the final price.  I will return the rifle to its owner if I haven't been able to sell by Dec. 9.

The metal on this classic lever action is rated as average.  There are several spots where rust has removed the blueing.  There is a spot on the barrel that is pitted from rust.  The blueing is good outside of the areas affected by rust.  The blueing look original to the firearm.  

A previous owner has engraved numbers/letters on the bottom of the receiver.  

The forearm is cracked farthest away from the receiver.  The buttstock is a replacement stock.  The fit to metal of the replacement stock is just adequate.  It has a Fajen buttplate.  The buttstock is oil finished.  The buttstock wood is fairly well matched to  the forearm wood.  

This isn't a wall hanger or a gun to put in your gun vault.  I believe this classic lever action will make an outstanding hunting rifle. 

I'm helping sell this firearm for a gentleman who is selling his collection of many fine firearms and knives (Randall and Case).  Search silverback for additional listings.  I hope to have an updated list of all firearms, ammo and knives by December 1.

Other info: Here is the link from Cabelas Cabela's: Pro Ears® Pro-Mag Gold Muffs

I picked up this set of Pro Ears Pro Tac Mag Gold NRR 33 Hearing Protection from Cabelas about 6 months ago. These were bought as an open box item with some minor scratches but, work perfectly. I used these for a total of 10 range trips and have had zero issues with them! The only reason I am selling these is because I am now shooting a lot more rifle and I feel that these muffs are suited better for handgun shooting protection.

I have owned many pair of muffs and these are by far the best I have ever owned. As far as Hearing Protection, the balance achieved between comfort, noise attenuation and purity of sound is amazing!. No compromises. No excuses. Real audiophiles understand that for purity of sound an analog sound system is superior to a digital sound system, however, digital systems can correct imperfections or enhance and modify sound better than analog systems. Most active hearing protectors or stereo headphones employ one technology or the other. 

I am asking 200.00 for this pair but am willing to listed to offers!

This is the 1.5 non-folding version and comes with the upgraded black pistol grip Viperskins and an Atlas V8 bipod.

From AI: ""Remington 700 users can benefit from many of the advanced ergonomic and functional benefits of the AICS, not merely a stock, but a far superior chassis system with full-length aluminium self-aligning, self-bedding vee block compared to traditionally bedded interfaces between actions and stocks.""

The chassis is adjustable in LOP and cheek height. It feels awesome and is a great upgrade from a stock Remington 700 or other custom action.

I bought this thinking I was going to do another custom build using the AICS as the stock platform. I have since gone a different route (long action) and am looking to pass along the stock to someone who will use it sooner than I.

Just for reference:
The AICS goes for around $850 new
The Viperskins are $200 new
The Atlas sells for $275 new
The TAB sling runs about $65 new

I feel like $975 is pretty fair for the setup, given its condition, so please don't bother with ridiculous offers. All fair trades or trades + cash will be considered. It is pretty heavily used (scratches on the skins and on mag-well area), but still in great working condition for a gun that you're going to USE.

Thanks for looking.

Higgins line and was called the Model 44 DLM .22 lever action rifle.  This is a 1969 that was built for the 1970 100th anniversary of Marlin.  It has a gold medallion inlaid into the butt stock.  This is the Marlin 57M that was built from 1959 to 1969 in .22 magnum.  The 57 was built from 1959 to 1965 but the magnum was built for 4 more years.  This rifle is in very good condition and in good working order.  It has been completely taken down cleaned, polished and oiled within the last 2 weeks.  It has a tube magazine that holds 15 rounds and the lever only moves 1.25"" to completely cycle the rifle.  The steel receiver is factory drilled and tapped for a scope but has never had one mounted on it.  Marlin did not build any of the Model 57 rifles with a serial number so this rifle has no serial number.  

I'm not going to post a price but I will listen to cash and trade offers...  What's this fine and rear rifle worth to you?

I am considering interesting firearms trades.  I like the Marlin Camp 45 and Camp 9 rifles.  Would also be interested in a .22 Magnum semi-auto pistol.

       My name is Greg, a private pilot that cleaned out my gun
collection. I have lots of ammo, new in box, from guns that were
fairly rare, so I assume that the ammo that accompanies them are not
so regular also! Like a Desert Eagle .50; Walter PPK/S, Krieghoff
shotguns.   I have attached a listing of exactly what they are.   They
are several years old, but have been taken care of everyday.   Been
inside Remington Ammo boxes locked inside an indoor custom gun closet.
  Upon inspection, and other than the original price tag, they all
appear to look fresh off the sales shelf, and certainly could be
resold as so, but do not know the rules on dealers selling ammunition.
 That is why I have contacted you.   Although I have found several
dealers and ranges that will accept them, I am attempting to sell them
for a fraction of their worth.   If this sounds of interest, please
contact me back.  Also, I could take pictures or even bring them by
for closer inspection.

       Instead of pricing each set individually; even though some
cartridges are surely worth more than another, I would entertain a
bulk sale for the entire collection.  I have roughly 1,350 rounds
(both shotgun and handgun) and was thinking maybe a dime (10 cents)
per round.  That arithmetic works out to close to 95% off the retail
price I paid for them all.   I know dealers get a wholesale cost on
ammunition but think this offer is still considerably fair and
worthwhile.

       Hopefully this wasn't a waste of your time, and appreciate very
much a response.

It is a Rossi/Braztech/Taurus 1892 lever-action rifle in .45LC. It has a 20"" barrel, buckhorn rear sight and gold-bead front sight. The barrel is 20"" long and the gun holds 10+1. It ejects out from the top, so the spent casings will be flung over your head and shoulder. It is in very good condition; no dings, scratches, rust etc. The bluing and the wood are in excellent shape. I don't have an exact round count, but it hasn't had many through it. My estimate would be at around or below 100 rounds. It's a very handy rifle and is popular with cowboy-action shooters, and I hear some even use it to hunt game.

He is looking to sell for $500 or trade for a lever-action rifle in .357 magnum, or a Ruger Vaquero (preferably stainless, and also preferably in .357). Other offers will be entertained, but he's interested mainly in old Western style firearms and not so much in anything tactical. You must be legal to own a firearm and willing to fill out a bill of sale for his personal record. He would prefer to meet in Lynnwood or in the Snohomish county area, but probably wouldn't mind going a little out of the way for something he likes."

Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

I currently have 15 boxes available. Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

Also still have the 3 factory choke tubes and wrench that came with it but no box.  $300 OBO

The reason for its popularity is because it shoots great, looks great and is remarkably affordable - about half the price of the competition's rifles.

The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself.

The Henry Lever Action also features side ejection, an adjustable rear sight, a hooded front sight and a grooved receiver for mounting a scope. The blued steel barrel is machined with state of the art multiple groove rifling. The result is a highly accurate shooter.

The barrel length is 18¼"", overall length is 36¼"" and it weighs in at a very comfortable 5¼ pounds. The easy to load tubular magazine can handle 15 rounds of .22 Long Rifle, 17 rounds of .22 Long and as many as 21 rounds of .22 Short, making it a viable alternative to a semi-automatic .22. And, a lot more fun to shoot.

Questions from buyers; ""Can you tell me more about the rifle?""

Answers; The rifle is made by century arms. Here is a link to there web page. You can call them up. Talk to them. You can look up reviews. Century arms makes millions of guns and the rifle that I have for sale is one of them. I have never fired it before. All of the mechanics of the rifle are tight. Nothing is loose and the barrel looks good. The Ak-74 that I have for my personal use shoots just fine. The reason I have the red dot on the rifle is because the Ak-74's have short iron sights and I think the red dot makes them shoot better. No! I know the red dot makes them shoot better. Problem solved. What I have found to work the best is to sight the red dot in at 100 yards with the target just above the dot. This way the dot does not cover the target and I think you will find the Ak to be very accurate all the way up to 300 yards. You will find that at 300 yards you will be hitting just below the dot on your red dot but of course you can sight it in any way you see fit. Other than that you just have to make sure when you take the side mount on and off. That when you put the side mount back on make sure it is all the way forward or it will not zero out. The side mount is quick release so if you ever have problems with it say like batteries die. Then it quickly comes off and you can use iron sights. Hope this helps you."

It comes with the full kit mag pouch, factory holster, cleaning rod, speed loader,  black hawk serpa paddle holster, a 10 round mag and 2, 13 round mags with sleeves. The trigger is very sweet and the action is very smooth

This gun is in like new condition and a tack driver! 

This is a factory built tactical/compact not a conversion!

The first $425.00 buys the gun! That means no tax and no paperwork just show a valid Ohio drivers license.

Call or text  Tommy with any questions

These were only made for a couple of years.  It is kinda ammo picky and prefers the CCI mini mags but the American Eagle and Remington ammo worked fine.  Very accurate.  It will include 2 mags.  These are 15 rounds mags. Initially these were sent out with one mag and they are no longer made by magnum research.  There are extra mags available online but they are few and far between and are running about $100 per mag. Im looking to get $375 firm.  This will also include a weaver rail and sight mark reflex sight that is relativley new (about 6 months).  I do not know round count and there is no box or owners manual.  You meet my asking price and I will toss in a couple of boxes of mini mags.  No shipping and PTC/PTP.   

The Sight Mark is sitting on top of a UTG riser.  The beavertail mount from the factory was insufficent for the sight mark.  I got the sortest one I could find and it takes a little getting used to.  The pitol itsself has adjustable sights so if you dont want the sight I will adjust the price and keep it."
