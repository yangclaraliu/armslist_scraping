Not really looking for another rifle.

First up is a single shot .45 cal smooth bore percussion pistol cutlass very similar to the 1835 Elgin patent. I'm not sure on load data as I haven't tried to shoot it but it uses #11 percussion caps. The US Navy ordered a little over a hundred of these before the Civil War for boarding enemy ships before deciding they weren't very practical. 











Next up is a 6.5 x 52mm Fucile di Fanteria Mod. 91/41 ""Carcano"" rifle. The ""Carcano"" is a bolt action rifle but is loaded by inserting 6 round en bloc clips into the fixed magazine like an M1 Garrand. The empty en bloc clip falls out the bottom of the fixed magazine when the last casing is ejected. If you aren't familiar with these old Italian war horses made infamous by the Kennedy Assassination, you can read more about them here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcano

This particular M91/41 was made in 1942 during WWII, only the second year of production for the model 91/41. After the end of the war, a limited initial run of military surplus ""Carcano"" rifles were marketed as ""hunting rifles"" by the Italians for export to the US civilian market and at least initially imported by Crescent Firearms Inc. of NY. Like many others, this one was modified in Italy where the stock was shortened and refinished, the cleaning rod and sling mounting hardware removed and the top of the chamber marked ""Made Italy"" with the export date of 1949 (later export runs corrected the poor translation of the marking to ""Made in Italy""). Other than the stock modification, the rest of the firearm (i.e. the barrel, bolt, receiver etc.) were not altered. The gun is not import marked and was only export marked by the Italians as described above, though Crescent was the only importer at this time as far as I know. Once stateside, this rifle and others were sent to various distributors who then sold them via mail order ads in magazines like American Rifleman up until 1968 when the Gun Control Act of that year banned the importation of foreign military surplus rifles and required all firearms be shipped only to federally licensed dealers (this import ban provision of the GCA was only repealed in 1986 by the Firearm Owner's Protection Act passed during the Reagan years). The Gun Control Act of 1968 was a reaction in part to the Kennedy Assassination when in 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald ordered a Crescent Firearms imported model M91/38 Carcano from a Klein's Sporting Goods mail order advertisement placed in the official NRA publication, The American Rifleman.

The timeline on this gun is what I find interesting in that it was made in '42, sold as surplus and exported to the US just 7 years later in '49 and was sold via mail order in the early 1950's. Most US buyers further modified these guns by drilling and tapping for a scope mount, cutting down barrels or removing the fixed sights. Other than the stock which was modified prior to ever reaching US soil, the gun exists as it would have upon mail order delivery to the American consumer back in the 1950s. It has sat relatively untouched since then. Of further interest is the fact that the two brass en bloc clips that were with the rifle (I don't believe the rifle originally came with them as all available ammo at the time was imported military surplus 6.5 x 52mm ammo that already came pre-loaded in the clips) are labled SMI, the acronym (in Italian) for the civilian manufacturer Italian Metalurgical Society along with the date stamp code 952 indicating a manufacture date of 1952. SMI produced surplus ammo well into the 1970s, but these clips are dated 1952 and consequently are of the exact same vintage as the one in the National Archives that was found with Lee Harvey Oswald's Carcano which he used to assassinate Kennedy.

This rifle is not one of the recently imported Century Arms Carcano rifles which are common and relatively inexpensive. While not a WWII bring back, it has collectors value as one of the very first Carcano rifles imported to the states and as a relic of a by-gone era when you could order a gun through the mail and have it shipped to your door.

Please contact for additional pics of the Carcano.

$175 for the Elgin, $250 for the Carcano or $350 for both."

 ■Ulta rigid 2-piece sliding frame adjusts to fit any gun
 ■Innovative new spring loaded elevation system allows for fast one handed, no wobble adjustment
 ■Open central channel accomodates detachable magazines and lever action guns
 ■Convenient storage compartment lid doubles as a handgun base 

The highly versatile Matrix combines great new features and rock solid stability in an affordable rest. Central tot eh design is the innovative, ultra rigid U-channel frame, quickly adjusting in length for the perfect fit with any gun while remaining perfectly stable. The two piece sliding frame incorporates an open central channel with plenty of clearance for hi-capacity detachable magazines (AR style guns) as well as lever action guns. A convenient storage area incorporated into the front of the base features a removable lid that adds additional clearance when detached but also doubles as a rubberized rear support surface for firing handguns when left in place. 

Another key feature is the all new innovative front elevation system. A spring loaded tension mechanism and height adjustment knob allow for fast, one handed elevation adjustments, keeping the front cradle wobble free throughout the entire vertical range. Overmolded front and rear supports protect the guns finish but are firm enough to prevent any give or play.

Shooters will also enjoy the versatility of converting the Matrix into a compact front rest be removing the rear portion of the frame. Weather used a s a front rest or as a full length rest the Matrix provides stability that will deliver maximum accuracy potential."

I just bought a 2013 Chevy Silverado and had a lift kit and new wheels & tires installed.  The stock wheels & tires are now sitting in my garage collecting dust, so this is your oppertunity to get a great deal and not pay retail price!!!   The wheels & tires are stock Chevy 18"" 5 Spoke Machined Silver w/ Goodyear Wrangler P265/65R18 112T.  This package is brand new with only 18 miles on them!!!!  If you bought these from the dealership they would cost you approx. $2,100 without installation.  You might be able to find them online for around $1,700.  Will fit any 2007 - Present: Avalanche, Tahoe, Silverado, Sierra, Suburban.    I have all center caps and lugnuts as well.
