Jason Breeden’s has.  He earned distinction as the knife designer who creates odd-shaped blades with the release of his first Spyderco collaboration, The Captain. Although critics initially found the Captain’s shape unusual they changed their opinion after using it and experiencing its pure functionality, quickly dismissing its quirky appearance as inconsequential. Jason’s second collaboration, the Spyderco/Breeden Rescue, is equally unconventional.  In keeping with his previous design, it reflects his hard-use outdoor experience in the Appalachian Mountains. The Breeden Rescue has a VG-10 Sheepfoot-looking hollow-ground blade.  Focus is placed on strength to the tip of the blade where a knife sees the greatest use (think digging or prying).  The end of the blade noticeably bulges outward, its breadth further accentuated by a non-sharpened spine swedge reducing the blade’s weight.  Black G-10 handle scales house a Walker LinerLock, full skeletonized liners, four-way silhouette pocket clip and piped lanyard hole.  Handle is made with screw-together construction. Unique and functional, the Rescue by Jason Breeden makes an impression both visually and functionally."

Digital camouflage pattern is a mosaic of small connected micro-patterns, optically reducing the eye’s ability to detect and discern an object. Digital patterns were developed to enhance concealment for our men and women of the U.S. Military going into harm’s way protecting our freedom. The Para-Military2 has several changes over the classic version.  The G-10 handle is narrowed at the end improving the ergonomics. The handle and blade have been profiled thinner; removing uncomfortable angles when in the closed position.  It features a Compression Lock and an ambidextrous-friendly four way clip which carries tip-up/tip-down, left/right-hand and rests deeper in a pocket.  We kept the same high-performance CPM-S30V full flat-ground blade but we’ve also lengthened the blade’s tip and added additional surface jimping to both the spine and finger choil.  Implementation of a new Bushing Pivot System generates fluid action and more consistent manufacturing tolerances.  Larger lanyard gives more options for carry. Refinements to overall construction may not be drastic or even visible to the eye but from the G-10 textured handle to the CPM-S30V steel full flat blade, everything is sharper, smoother and guaranteed to provide performance and user comfort.

Willing to ship within the US to buyer's FFL for actual shipping charges.
Most varmint guns are easily recognized by their heavy barrels, bipod mounting studs and long range scopes, but they are far from being equal. The new Winchester® Coyote Light is the rifle to take along for varmint and target shooting fun. It has been carefully trimmed of any unnecessary bulk but is no lightweight when it comes to performance. The matte-blued receiver and medium-heavy fluted matte blued barrel mount into a skeletonized aluminum bedding block that is set in a lightweight carbon fiber/fiberglass composite Bell and Carlson™ stock for superb accuracy. Flow-through vents on the fore-end reduce weight and help cool the barrel during long strings of fire. A Pachmayr® Decelerator® pad helps soak up recoil.

I have a like new Colt M4-22 for sale. The gun is made by Walther in Germany and is very reliable. Feeds Win or Federal bulk ammo all day long. Extremely accurate. 

The gun has a thread adapter that allows you to attach  a suppressor  or a flash hider of your choice. The trigger is an experimental ""target"" trigger that the chief engineer at Walther sent to me from Germany.After we had a long phone conversation. It is nice and crisp now and as far as I know this is the only one of its kind.

I just got divorced and just got my own place after spending 2 months in the homeless shelter. I am just now getting my life back together but need your help. If you need a little (or a lot) of work done, I’m your man. I am a hard worker who will gladly do whatever job you ask as long as it’s legal. If I don’t know how to do something I’ll let you know and if you can train me great, if not I’ll try and find someone who can do what you need done. But first a little about me. My name is Andrew. I am 23 years old, divorced, living on the east side by north Smithville and east Third Street. I lack a car but do have a valid Ohio driver’s license with no points on it. I have transportation in the form of a RTA month bus pass. I do have a minor criminal record but they are misdemeanors and are not drug, theft, or sex crimes. I have a valid Ohio concealed weapons permit as proof I am not a felon. I am willing to furnish my driver’s license, ccw permit, birth certificate, and high school diploma upon request as well as answer any questions you may have. I prefer to be paid in cash daily. However if you are a company I have no problem getting on your payroll. If you are not a major company I will need to seed proof you are able to pay me before I begin work as I have been scammed before. I am also willing to take working firearms on trade for any work I do, however that is on a case by case basis. Some examples of what I can do are:
-tutoring any subject other than math for high school and under or history for college. 
- security work (including bouncing and doorman)
- house or pet sitting
-dog walking
-house, office, car cleaning
-helping you move
-lawn care
-retail
-construction or demolition
-making phone calls for you.
-if you have a car I am willing to drive you places or teach you to drive
-help with errands
-help prepare meals
-babysit
-general labor
-marksmanship/ self defense instruction
-companionship (of a non-sexual nature, don’t even ask)
Some jobs I have had in the past are: 
Janitor
Bagger/ stocker for a grocery store
Security guard
My special skills are:
Fluent in English and can make myself understood in Spanish
Good driver
Can lift 50lbs on my own regularly
Can use Microsoft word and powerpoint on xp and windows 7
Have much experience in cleaning
Good with animals and kids
Am alert and observant, can keep calm under pressure.
I should let you know that is some cases (but not all) I can supply tools. Right now it’s just steel toed boots, goggles, and work gloves but that will change. I am flexible on pay. I can work whenever. Please contact me with the following information:
Your name (first name will suffice)
Your contact info (phone number is preferred)
What you want me to do
How much you are willing to pay (ether per hour or per day) and method of payment
Where you want me to work (just a general area will work until I accept, but must be on the bus line or within 1.5 miles of an RTA stop unless you are providing transport)
When you are wanting me to work and if it is temporary or permanent
I will get back to you within 48 hours with an answer but will probably be less than 24 hours.

""W W Greener gun no. 48614 was started on 17th November 1899 and finished on 27th April the following year.  It is described as a ‘Monarch’ model (M), a 12 bore double barrel, hammerless, ejector shotgun with 30 inch Montrieux steel barrels.  The stock dimensions when made were 2 ¾ by 14 ¼ inches, half pistol hand.  The gun has a Facile Princeps action with Baker fore end ejectors and was a medium grade gun introduced to replace the earlier medium grade self-acting ejector models (G guns).  The higher grade ‘Royal’ , ‘Imperial’ and ‘Presentation’ or, ’Exhibition’, models were still made using self-acting ejectors.  It has black powder proof marks and so should not be used with nitro cartridges unless it undergoes re-proof to ensure it is safe to use with these faster burning loads which create greater pressures than those for which the gun was originally tested.  It was also proved originally at 13 /1 bore so the internal diameter of the bores should be between .719 and .727 of an inch."""

Product Description
The Franchi I-12 represents a new line of Franchi auto-loaders by incorporating a free-floating bolt with the Inertia Driven System. The I-12 is well-balanced, and features a narrow-profile fore-end and buttstock. This Franchi shotgun will handle anything from 1-1/8-ounce target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. Every I-12 Franchi shotgun is powered by the Inertia Driven System. That means no bulky gas cylinders, valves, pistons, or hardware. Without that extra baggage, the I-12 has a slender, low-profile fore-end that fits the shooter's hand for comfortable handling. The I-12's specially-designed recoil pad incorporates a two-part system called the Twin Shock Absorber. During firing, the TSA recoil pad initially holds its shape, and then deeply compresses with the recoil, soaking up the kick and spreading recoil energy over a wider area of the shooter's shoulder, reducing felt recoil by up to 44%. The I-12 in Max-4 HD is an ideal choice as a waterfowl gun. This variant also features a 28-inch ventilated rib barrel, and a red-bar front sight and includes a set of screw-in choke tubes.
