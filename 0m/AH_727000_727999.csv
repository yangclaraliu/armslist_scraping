Used it lightly for a summer, then I grew up....lol all joking aside this is a great gun. I bought it because it was made in America.I included the specs from airgun depot. However, I got a lot of upgrades. I put on a secondary picattinny rail on top, as well as the standard looking AR carrying handle. I have a leapers red/green dot scope, as well as 1 extra regular mag, and an electric mag that holds 1000 rounds. I also have a gun case for it, and I believe I have the clearing rod, etc. For it. It also comes with a detachable rear site if you don't like the carrying handle on top with the red dot site. It's super versatile, and if I was more into it I would use it a ton! But like I said....I grew up. :-) so, if you haven't grown up, or you just want a super cool airsoft gun with appx 100 worth of upgrades shoot me an email. I'm uploading this on my iPhone so I don't think I can upload pix, but I can email them if you are interested.

Should your batteries go dead, just center a target in the Redot tube with buckshot you're good to go. Or, use the Redot tube as a rear ghost ring and pop up your Magpul front sight, zeroed however you like. Has a no-bind modification on the trigger housing to ensure a blow to the action release or sand/dirt won't make the release inoperable. Barrel is just over 19 inches, so that it sits a bit behind the end of the magazine tube, to protect it from dings. Has a simple OD green quick adjust sling that is included.

The shell latches should probably be re-staked eventually. Unless you completely disassemble the gun and remove the trigger housing, it presents no issue (they are held in place by the trigger housing retaining pins of course). Doesn't effect the operation of the gun, just makes reassembly less easy from a complete tear-down. A shell latch staking tool runs $35 and it's a simple operation. Does come with 25 rounds of hard to find (in .20 gauge) 00 Buckshot!

Have over $700 just in parts on the shotgun and figure the receiver/gun ads another $175-250 on top. Am including a second, brand new S2AR grip adapter by Elite Tactical Advantage so you can build another (in .12 gauge perhaps) tactical shotgun, which adds another $90; the case, sling and QD mount adds $110 (sorry, that .20 ga Youth model 870 isn't included), and a full length stock bolt for traditional stocks that is not shown in the photos but is included. $900 just in parts, worth $1075-1150 not including the receiver/gun itself, but I'm asking just $800.

Also available are 250 shares I own of the zombie movie, Autumn, by British horror novelist David Moody. Starring Dexter Fletcher (“Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels”, “Doom”) Dickon Tolson (“Peak Practice”, “Eastenders”) and David Carradine (“Kill Bill”, “Kung Fu”), this is the ONLY zombie movie the late David Carradine ever starred in. I'll even include my personal DVD copy of the movie. You can check my legitimate ownership through the film company, Renegade Motion Pictures...or check out my name in the film credits (I did some marketing consulting for the film) and the personally autographed poster signed for me by the Director, Stephen Rumbelow.

Shares were sold to fund the movie at a going rate of $20 per share (Canadian, is a Canadian made film). Thus, they had an issue value of $5000 CD. With exchange rates, back then, that was around $4700 US, but as of today, the exchange rate means US dollars are worth more than Canadian just a bit! Now, these are not exchange traded stocks and so are valued at what you can sell them for. They ARE preferred stock, however.

I'm willing to include the extras (second S2AR grip and case/sling/QD mount) and the movie shares with the shotgun--or not--anything is open to discussion. Let's make a deal...before the zombies end the Internet. Value of $800 is for the gun and extra accessories, but does not include the movie shares. Price or trade value with the shares...we'll come to an agreement. If you want the shares by themselves, we can discuss that to.

Come on by, we'll make you a deal on this cowboy classic!

Pistol cartridge lever-actions have had attention of the American public since the days of the Old West when having a rifle and pistol that shoot the same caliber just made sense.

There are numerous variations-rifles, carbines, standard loop, oversized loop-including Rossi's Model '92 hybrid-the Ranch Hand. The Ranch Hand is available in three popular pistol rounds- .38 Spl./.357 Mag., .44 Mag. and .45 Colt.

The Ranch Hand's 12-inch barrel complies with federal regulations, and features a gold-bead front sight with an adjustable buckhorn rear sight and an oversized loop lever."

I am getting a Glock carbine in.45 and want to dedicate one Glock frame to it and swap my competition slide  to a different large Glock frame which is the .45 or 10 mm frame. The frame is what I need but I'll take a working or non working glock. I like 10mm but .45 is better in my opinion. The frames are the same dimensions on the both so they can be swapped with other full frame slides. If you just have a Glock FULL FRAME(.45 OR 10 MM) that is in good shape, I would even take a beat up Glock as long as the frame is solid. The slide is not nessesary. Rails are needed or preferred. email and tell me what you have.I built my Glock slide up very nice and need a Full size frame for it .It would be a shame for it to just sit in the safe now.

Although not a common caliber, ammo for this gun is readily available at most major retailers including Walmart.  Perfect for a smaller hand, the grip is the same dimensions as it's 9mm cousin - but with 45acp power.  45GAP (Glock Action Pistol) was a proprietary invention of Glock to address the fact that widebody Glock 45's weren't easy to grip for smaller hands.  Ballistically almost identical to 45ACP.  With the extra barrel length and weight the recoil on this pistol is very mild.  Perfect for the first home defense weapon.  Price is firm, 100 bucks worth of ammo and four mags."

Comes with Redfield scope and hard case. I am only selling this because I can no longer deer hunt due to a health condition.

From Remington's site:

The most dependable slide action of all time in three advanced designs that will go the distance with deadly precision, whether your target is the crease behind a buck’s shoulder or a big red head. We’ve built the industry’s finest rifled slug guns for years, but our new 12-gauge Model 870™ SPS™ ShurShot™ Synthetic Super Slug advances deer-leveling technology to farther reaches and smaller group sizes than ever before possible. Even more so when paired with high-performance ammunition like our Premier AccuTip sabot slugs.

Because barrel stability is key to extended-range accuracy, this shotgun’s barrel is of extra-heavy, 1"" diameter configuration and measures a full 25 1/2"". It’s also pinned to the receiver to control vibration for rifle-like, shot-to-shot consistency. Five longitudinal flutes keep weight and heat buildup to a minimum while bolstering barrel rigidity. Six Parabolic Ultragon™ rifling grooves with a 1-in-35"" twist optimize slug flight. But much more than just the ultimate accuracy-enhancing barrel design, this shotgun provides the rock-steady aim and outstanding pointability of our ambidextrous ShurShot pistol-grip synthetic stock. Rubberized overmolding at the pistol grip and extended fore-end offer a sure hold in adverse conditions. For unmatched shooting comfort, we added the SuperCell™ recoil pad. The receiver is drilled and tapped, and the included Weaver rail makes adding optics a cinch. Sling swivel studs are built in.

Sand cult bolt carrier, paddle mag release.  These were Century's first builds, and they had no issues, until they switched to some off-brand receivers.  Barrel has had the first inch cut off, so it's a 20 inch barrel (to comply with regulations associated with the assault weapons ban of the 90's) it has no muzzle control device on it, and it's not threaded.  Lower is, I believe, an R1.  Fires and functions flawlessly.  It's scratched up a bit and isn't a safe queen by any measure, but it's always been cleaned.  I will include four (4) 20rd metric mags and 200rds of Greek .308 7.62 surplus - I mean, what's a rifle without ammo?  This is/was a Century built gun that I had headspaced to check for a common problem at the time (passes).  It was my first FAL - I've moved on to more expensive versions, and this one hasn't been shot in about ten years - it needs a new home.  No, I wont take any more pictures of it or separate the mags or ammo from it.  No, I wont minutely examine the internal parts to tell you who made them either."

I do not have a particular brand preference but do not want some cheap rifle either.  My limit is around $600.  I would prefer it to have all wood accessories as it originally would have, but will not be turned away by a plastic stock/foregrip.  I would also prefer it have a couple of magazines with it, but once again this is not a deal breaker for me.  If you could please send me an email with what you have and your location I would greatly appreciate it.  I am located around the Peru area and would like to keep my driving distance to around an hour.

Some history on this gun.  

The 1917 enfield was originally designed for the british as the pattern 1914 or P-14 enfield ,,it was chambered for the 303 british cartridge and was produced by winchester +remington ,,The British were in the midst of ww1 and were haveing trouble produceing enough No1mkIII rifles and asked for help from the US ,,the US companys steped up to the plate and designed a rifle cheaper to mass produce than the enfield and the p-14 was designed ,,there were many sent to Britan during ww1 but the British troops liked the no1 over the p-14 and so the p-14 was used as secondary reserve rifles ,,Later on in the war the US entered the conflict and production of the 1903 springfield was in full swing and rifles couldn't be produced fast enough to satisfy the demand ,, The companys that built the p-14 deceided that they could retool and chamber the rifle to the new 30-06 round,, and the 1917 or p17 enfield was born,,the p-14 and P17 were so simular that during ww2 over a million P17's were sent to Britan on the lend lease program and these 30-06 rifle had to have a red stripe painted on the stock to distinguish them from the 303 chambered p14 rifles ,,the rifles never saw the action the 1903 Springfield saw and alot of soilders complaind that they were heavy and akward and favored the 1903 rifles over the 1917,,so again the 1917 was used mostly with home defence and training purposes,,during ww2 it was also used as home defence and training and again saw limited action mostly in the Pacific,, 

,,The action on the 1917 is a very robust action based on the Mauser dual locking lug design and have been the starting point for many fine custom sporting rifles because of the strenght of the action and the long magazine lenght allowing for rechambering in calibers as large as the 458 mag with only minor modifications to the magazine ,, this rifle was also the father to Remingtons model 30 bolt action which was Remingtons first high power sporting rifle and it used a modified 1917 action design and even had the bent bolt simular to the 1917,,,The actions from these rifles can sell for around 250 alone to gunsmiths for custom rifle building ,,complete unaltered rifle can sell in the 400-650 range for the most manufactures and even higher for Winchester examples if complete and original,,the Eddystone models were actually made by Remington at there Eddystone Pa. plant,,your winchester might be better answered by our moderator 2bit,,

SAFETY
Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.
Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.
Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.
Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.
Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.
Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case 
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries."

This is NOT a parts gun, this is NOT a Cetme POC, this is NOT a P91 this is the real deal.    For those who dont know, the original SAR8's were actually made in Greece on HK licensed equipment, this is an ""overstamp"" gun in case you care and know what it means.  Then George Bush the first decided to create the ""sporting arms test"" and they couldn't import it anymore.  It's as HK as you can get.  This one has a factory bipod and carry handle and I installed an XS sight systems tritium sight set on it (front and rear).  There's a little clamp on picatinny rail that will NOT come with it, but I will inlude an ARMS clamp on rail (picatinny) if you wish to attach a scope to it.  Original german leather sling and the buttstock is a rare variant also.  I have 6 aluminum mags and ten Thermold mags that will come with it. I've put maybe 400 rounds through it. Zombies are impressed by this rifle.   Thiis not even remotely comparable to the later models of SAR sporters that Springfield tried to sell people, it's a Greek manufactured HK91.  Please refrain from offering me your military surplus trash in exchange for this gun, I know who you are and I'm not interested in enriching some collector.  This is a serious rifle for someone who NEEDS it.  Why am I selling it?  I prefer FAL's.  I also have a bit of extra parts that go with this rifle, since I don't have any other HK91's I have a parts kit that includes everything except the receiver (of course) and the green slimline furniture.  Several magazines with it, both aluminum and thermold.  The buyer will also have the right to purchase up to 1k in german ball ammo in 200rd battlepacks at current market rates."

Until you’ve held and shot a Marlin, you don’t know what a lever-action rifle can be. The ultra-smooth cycling and solid feel are created through a superior receiver design, the finest materials and a flawless meshing of these high-quality components. To produce our trademark excellence, our lever actions are built to strict tolerances rivaling those used to craft custom rifles. Further, all major components of the action are machined from heat-treated, solid steel forgings. The Marlin lever action’s swift pointing characteristics, lightning-fast follow-ups, reliability and inherent accuracy have made it America’s favorite. And what started with the invention of the first flat-top, side-eject receiver in 1889 has led us to pioneer every major advancement in the lever-action category since.

A must-have for every gun collector. It has been in continuous production longer than any other rifle in America. Is it the tack-driving accuracy, superb looks or centerfire-like heft that’s made it such a historical fixture? Yes, in all respects, the Model 39A is incomparable to any rimfire in the world today. Remarkably, it can be disassembled in seconds with only a coin. Thanks to Micro-Groove® rifling, a special process that produces less bullet distortion and a better gas seal, this rifle punches tiny groups most other 22s can’t touch. The stock is crafted of genuine American black walnut and adorned with fine cut checkering.

The aluminum box is stamped with a full ""progressive"" die to produce tightest tolerances. The welding process along the box seams has been automated to insure optimum weld ingot, strength and compliance with MIL-STD. The surface finish has been improved to meet or exceed MIL-PRF-46010 (required for U.S.G.I. magazines). Magazine boxes are treated with Molybdenum Disulphide (""Moly"") for its exceptional adherence properties which ensure long lasting protection and lubricity - far superior to the PTFE (Teflon) used on other magazines. Finally, these magazines now have a new ""anti-tilt"" follower that ensures the round is fed into the chamber properly -preventing failure to feed problems. Drop tests have proven the advantages of the anti-tilt follower over the traditional green follower. As an additional aid, the followers are caliber marked - 5.56in this case. Highest quality tempered steel springs, and Bushmaster logo stamped baseplates (removable for cleaning) round out the improvements on these superior magazines - which have been endorsed by the National Tactical Officers Association."

I've got the sheath for it, open and closed it a dozen times, and probably shaved my arm hair once to check the edge and that's it. It was strapped to a backpack's molle webbing for a short time, but that pack hardly, if ever, left the closet. 

It's nice, it's sharp, and it's well made!! From the mfg...

""The Gerber 06 Automatic features an over-sized release button for use with gloves, a slide safety that engages in both the open and closed positions, a stainless steel pommel with a strike point and a lanyard hole compatible with 550 cord, a partially serrated edge, and a contoured aluminum handle for a secure grip whether your working with blade or the handle. The stainless steel blade is made using S30V, a premium stainless steel that stands up to incredible abuse while holding its edge like no other.""

Price is $100 + shipping which would be ~$5 flat rate. Trade for ??? of equal value, related to guns, ammo, reloading, hunting, etc. Need a press if anyone has a single stage available.

I do not need all the extras like composite stock, pistol grips, extended magazines, or picatinny rails. If you have one that's modified but also have the original parts we can talk.

I can offer $250-$300 cash (depending on quality and condition) just in time for Xmas should you need it. I am not looking for any hot, stolen or other illegal firearms, I would expect any transaction to be on the level, during daylight hours at an agreed upon public place with any required paperwork.

I have posted in the Lansing area but can travel to meet if need be.
Thank you for your time,
Ben T."

I would like to have this done by the end of the week.  A great gift for yourself or your family.  

This is a 1984, 20"" 3' Invader Cabin Cuddy with a Inboard/Outboard 225HP Volvo Pentax Engine with only 316 hours. I am the 3rd owner. I know the previous owner (who knew the original owner). I bought this when I was in Parris Island, and I LOVED it. I hate to get rid of it, but I have some new hobbies, and an aggressive training schedule at work so that means I just don't get out on the water as much as I would like. I know that it is a little bit older, but the boat and engine are solid. I used to take this with my family on 60 mile round trip runs when I was in SC with NO problems. 

It seats 6 without using the cabin cuddy, or converting the front seats to bench seats. If you convert the driver seat and the passenger seat to bench seats it seats 8. I bought a new radio and fish finder in 2010 which are included. 
Also included are 
-(3) recreational towing inter tubes 
-Anchor and chain 
-Bumpers 
-More than enough life jackets to support any adult / kid combination you might take out with you ( roughly 7 and 7, with 2 or three tubing life jackets included ). 

The speedometer doesn't work (easy fix, just a broken needle). 

I know it's a slightly older boat than some of the other boats you might see, but this is worth every penny. I have never had a problem with the boat, and until 2010, this boat has never seen everything but fresh water. I have taken it as far as 2 miles off shore with no problems. I have thoroughly washed the boat down every time it was taken out. 

Full disclosure. The trailer could use some work. I have towed the trailer from Ohio to South Carolina, and then to North Carolina. The hydraulic brakes on the trailer need to be rebuilt. There is rust damage on the trailer. It was that way when I bought the boat, I just never got around to fixing it. For short jaunts to your local boat ramp, you will be fine, but if you plan on taking it long distances you will probably want to get the breaks fixed and the trailer checked out. 

I have plenty of pictures that I can email or text you."
