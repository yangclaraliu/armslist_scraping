The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced techno-polymer. The Nano's sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hex wrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

SIG Sauer German. 40 Cal Smith and Wesson semi auto pistol. It's excellent condition with less than 500 rounds fired. One of the sweetest trigger double and single action pulls I've seen on a factory pistol. Its never jammed and is quite accurate. It comes w 3 12 round cap factory mags and 1 10 cap magazine, factory case, manual. 1 box of 50 target ammo and the 3 12 round mags are loaded with Winchester Ranger hollow point self defense loads. It comes with a left handed inside the waist band leather holster. This is the same model that many us military and law enforcement agencies carry. Its a mid 90s model. If you know SIGs you know the older models are sought after as new production offerings have been known to have quality control issues, thanks to CEO Cohen emphasizing cosmetics over craftsmanship.

The P 88 is insensitive to variations in ammunition, and it is the only Walther made that is completely ambidextrous. Its double action and integral safeties combined with a high capacity magazine make it superior to everything previously made.

This Walther P88 is in excellent condition and has been rated at 98%. It is in the original box, wrapped in the original plastic bag, with two magazines, cleaning rod, original test target, owners manual, and safety manual.

No other semi-automatic rifle has captured the imagination of the shooting public like the SG 550 series rifle. For years this legendary Swiss made rifle has been restricted to law enforcement and military sales where it has continuously built on its reputation for outstanding performance, accuracy and durability. SIG SAUER offers the U.S. produced version as the SIG556, which is available to the general consumer and law enforcement markets. The SIG556 features the same high-performance two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system engineered by SIG's sister company Swiss Arms and marries it to a trigger housing that not only cuts the rifle's weight by a pound but is designed to accept standard AR magazines."

I have decided to narrow down my collecting and make some changes in the direction I am going and need to make some room.

Rifle:

Up for Sale or Trade is a 1944 Inland Div M1 Carbine
Rifle is NOT an import nor is it import marked.

Rifle comes with 3 magazines, original butt stock 2 cell mag holder
original m1 carbine sling. I am not an expert on the M1 Carbine and
don't claim to be.  I have taken a lot of photo's of the carbine which can
tell more of the rifle then I can.

I would say the rifle probably has been arsenal refurbished and the serial number puts it in the Jan-August 1944' production range. I would put the bore condition in an overall fair condition, it is bright but show possibility of some frosting. I tried to take a couple of photo's of the bore, I don't have a bore scope so not able to get a real good look.

The Barrel is undated but is a WW-II barrel as it is marked "" BI "" front of swaged gas cylinder which indicate it is an Brown-Lipe-Chapin Division
General Motors Corporation barrel Syracuse, New York

The Stock appears to have been repaired in a couple of places, I do not
know who did the repairs. I have taken pictures of this area as well.
The rifle shoots fine and stock gives no problem. It is properly marked with
the Cartouche on the stock as well.

I completed a M1 Carbine Data sheet on the breakdown of this carbine and I have included it also in the pictures.  I do not know that the TE or ME would be as I dont have gauges for it.  Carbine does pass a quick bullet test, picture taken of this as well

Best I can say is check out the photos for much better ideal of the carbine.

Sale Price:  $550 if needing to be shipped includes shipping
                   $525 if bought local-FTF

It comes with 2 clips and extra sights from the factory. Also, it had been modified with the new Gen. 2 FMK trigger from the factory. I also have a pelican case that I store it in, i will throw that in for an extra $40.

This gun is also called the freedom gun because it is engraved with the bill of rights (10 amendments) looks very cool. 


Here is a review.

The FMK 9C1 Gen 1, is ergonomically-built to comfortably fit both large and small hands. The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip. With its smooth DAO trigger the 9C1 Gen 1 has virtually no external protrusions making it ideal for concealed carry, and of course, its PROUDLY AMERICAN.

The civilian import model of the AK-102, this Saiga rifle comes from the same factory as its military counterpart.  Even though labeled as .223, the robust Russian military engineering lets this rifle eat the much more common 5.56 NATO round with ease.  Like any AK variant, this rifle can run wet, dirty, or even partially damaged, though it's in perfect condition at the moment.  With a good shooter, and decent ammo, accuracy can be expected to hover around 2-3 MOA, a significant improvement over almost any AK.

This is the standard sporter import model, so there is no 922r concern with parts count.  I purchased it as a project rifle, but simply couldn't find the time to toy with all the neat little parts I could find for it.

I will sell the rifle for $400, or trade for a bolt action rifle of similar value (Marin X7, Savage 11, etc.)."

745,http://www.armslist.com/posts/531745,"Want To Buy:  Denver Shooting Club, Thoughts?","Denver Metro and suburbs, Denver, Colorado",Offer,"Listed On: Saturday, August 25, 2012",Events,no type,no type,no type,no type,"**Please take time to read through and leave helpful feedback**

Anyone hunter, target shooter or gun enthusiast who has lived in Denver knows that the capital city of one of the most gun/hunter friendly states provides few opportunities to maintain proficiency as a hunter or marksman. While there is a selection of shooting ranges in the city, albeit dwindling, many are considered to be over-priced, un-welcoming, or unsuitable for certain types of shooting (3-gun, quick draw, long range, etc.). The easiest alternative is to find private land with owners consent. However, few city-dwellers have easy contact with farmers and ranchers, and few farmers and ranchers are overly eager to have gun-toting city dwellers traipse about their land. That leaves public land, owned by the Departments of Wildlife, the Forestry Department, or the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). One look at a government map of the state of Colorado shows an abundant supply of free-to-shoot land... on the western slope. Us Front-Rangers are mainly limited to Pawnee National Grasslands in the northeast, and Comanche in the south. I have personally been to both Pawnee and Comanche, and can testify that while they are both no-frills nothing-fancy areas to shoot, they are perfect for any activity you can think of, within the confines of the law, obviously. The only draw-back to Pawnee for Denver shooters is the drive. From Exit 1-25 exit 200, the shooting area I have visited was just around 90 miles away, and that was the well known ""busy"" area. There are more remote areas with longer distances to backdrops for distance shooters, but those may be another 20 miles away. For a solo outing to blow off some rounds or to dial in a rifle, a 160-200 mile round trip drive is less than ideal. Which made me ask; has anyone seen, heard of, or thought about a Denver Metro Shooting Club? I am not talking about a gun club with fees or weird initiations or mandatory meetings, I am think about something more relaxed and useful.
The idea I have would be to make a Facebook page where people could simply post where they are going to shoot, when, for how long, and how many people they could take. Also, they could list what they might expect to help out with gas, as well as rules they would want to abide by. 
An example would be;

1 shooter going to Pawnee Sunday, August 26th. Departing Denver at 0930, will return home 1700. Have room for 3 more shooters. Would like $10 per passenger for fuel, or a box of 12ga or 5.56. No drinking, no littering.

I understand many are wary of strangers, but have to say everyone I have met on Armslist has been really cool so far. I've sold magazines to military veterans and purchased sights and rifles from active and retired law enforcement. I think that if we are honest about what the group could be, efficient car-pooling and friendly shooting with responsible individuals, this could be a success. It could also be a great way for hunters to network and make new hunting friends. Small-gamers could gain access to new prairie dog and rabbit land, and any friends of farmers can help their farmer friends out with a plethora of new responsible shooters. There will be no tolerance for the shooters that spend all afternoon drinking and shooting and leave hundreds of shotgun shells and dozens of beer cans littered about giving a bad name to shooters everywhere.

If something similar to what I have described already exists, I would love to know about it. Please feel free to email me at REDACTED and let me know what kind of shooting you would like to do, and maybe a short paragraph including your shooting experience. If there is a strong enough response, I will take the next step in making this real.

Thanks so much for taking the time to read this. I would appreciate any feedback you may have.

It is not designed for heavy rounds, it is designed for waterfowl and small game. I bought it as a home defense gun not knowing this. It is the same internally as a model 50.

However if you need service or warranty work on a new piece of equipment and need our help in accessing them, we will be glad to answer any questions or help you get in contact with the right party.

All used items are ""as is"" and no warranties are given or implied. No refunds on firearms if transferred. Inspect the weapon at the dealer! Shipping and Handling is not refundable. Most product photos are of the actual item. Occasionally we will use stock photos on our listing. Some serial numbers in the photos will not match the actual item.

Firearms are warrantied by the MANUFACTURER.

* All used items are ""as is"" and no warranties are given or implied by Spartan Arms.
* Once a firearm has been transferred, it is now used.
* All guns from Davidson's come with Davidson's lifetime warranty.

Product Returns

All sales are final. We do not accept Returns or exchanges. Please be sure that you are legally able to purchase the firearm in your area. Any purchases that cannot be accepted or are refused by the FFL will incur a minimum $25 restocking fee for handguns and a minimum $35 restocking fee for Long guns.
