The price listed is for 1 bag of 100.  

    This brass is true 5.56 x 45 MM mil-spec, heavy duty brass.  This is the same brass in use with the US Military.  As with all brass, cases should be sized, chamfered and de-burred before loading.

    A light ""staining"" may be found on the case neck of new brass. This is due to annealing. Annealing is a process, performed by the manufacturer, which involves rapid heating to a specified temperature followed by rapid cooling. This process imparts cases with the proper hardness to securely hold a bullet as well as gives flexibility to expand and contract upon firing and repeated forming. The ""staining"" is a residue from this process. This stain may be removed by tumbling before loading.    

    If you have any questions, please contact me via e-mail at REDACTED or call REDACTED.

The versatile 3XMag also can be used as a handheld magnifying glass monocular for discrete observation and identification.

Those serial # were 534000/599000.
 After the 8 September 1943 armistice between Italy and the Allies, the Germans saddled Beretta with three engineers from Germany. Moreover the factory was GARRISONED BY THE SS! Weapons of that time, even the ones produced for the Germans, bore the punch mark 4UT, (Quarto Ufficio tecnico di Controllo Armi e Munizioni--4th Technnical Control Unit...
-an C. Still, in Axis Pistols, page 107, states,
""It is likely that almost all of the 4/UT, ...were used by the German Army"". He also includes two other variations in this statement, ""1944 dated and blank slide Model 1935"".
Ugo Menchini, in Pietro Beretta Le Automatiche, regarding an M1934, page 255, states,
""In late 1940 there appears an oval including the punch mark IVU. It refers to the 4th technical Control Unit of the FAG, where inspection was carried out.""
 Note that, while they seem to represent the same inspectors, the ""IVU"" is not the same mark as the ""4UT"". The IVU would be found on the pre RSI model M1934, and the 4UT would be found on the RSI model M1935.
 These are the reasons why I believe that it is likely that all of the 4UT Berettas WERE RSI pistols!! the IVU and the 4UT were the same office, but under Italian management -the IVU, before the surrender of Italy, and German the 4UT, so after september, 8 1943.

These are the same guns as the Rock Island Armory, just with double diamond wood grips and a better trigger. This particular gun has had the barrel throat and feed ramp polished to a mirror finish and the extractor tuned up to eliminate any of the feeding issues you typically find with the Armscor ""Officer"" models. 

I got this gun as a trade earlier this year, the gentleman I got it from claimed to have only put a few boxes through it, and I have personally fed this little guy close to 2000 rounds. The gun does have the ""idiot scratch"" from the slide release after my first time taking the gun down. 

I'm asking $450 for the gun with 4 mags included (2 ACT-MAG 7rd, 1 ProMag 7rd, and 1 Springfield Armory 6rd). I also have an OD Green Hogue wraparound grip with finger grooves (feels great, I just like the traditional look), Comes with the original plastic case with the warranty card, fired brass, and gun lock.

Firearms Manufacturing, McMillan Group International have been 
collectively
banking with Bank of America for 12 years. Today Mr. Ray Fox, Senior 
Vice
President, Market Manager, Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking 
(Bank
of America) came to my office. He scheduled the meeting as an ""account
 analysis"" meeting in order to evaluate the two lines of credit we have 
with
them. He spent 5 minutes talking about how McMillan has changed in the 
last
5 years and have become more of a firearms manufacturer than a supplier 
of
accessories. At this point I interrupted him and asked ""Can I possibly 
save
you some time so that you don't waste your breath? What you are going to
tell me is that because we are in the firearms manufacturing business 
you no
longer want my business.""
""That is correct"", he says. I
replied ""That is okay, we will move our accounts as soon as possible. We
can find a 2nd Amendment friendly bank that will be glad to have our
 business. You won't mind if I tell the NRA, SCI and everyone one I know
that BofA is not firearms-industry friendly?"" ""You have to do what you
must"", he said. ""So you are telling me this is a politically motivated
 decision, is that right?"" Mr. Fox confirmed that it was. At which point 
I
told him that the meeting was over and there was nothing left for him to
say.
I think it is important for all
Americans who believe in and support our 2nd amendment ""right to keep 
and
bear arms"" should know when a business does not support these rights. 
What
you do with that knowledge is up to you. When I don't agree with a 
business'
political position, I cannot, in good Conscience support them. We will 
soon
no longer be accepting Bank of America credit cards as payment for our

 This is an older Pennsylvania flintlock type black powder gun, don't know much about it, but it is in nice condition, could use some cleaning. My 14 year old got it from an older uncle on a trade. He would rather have the cash or other gun, shotgun, riffle ect..., so yes open to trades. I don't think they make these anymore, so would be great for a collector, or just a muzzeloader hunter.

There areis several modifications that have been made to this  weapon to make it slightly better than its factory original counterparts (IMHO). The first modification that was made to the grips. The factory original magwell grips were stippled to increase their function and enable better grip in adverse conditions (i.e. wet or sweaty hands, bloody hands, etc) The second modification was made to the barrel. I sent my P226 back to the factory to install and fit a Threaded Barrel into the weapon. The third modification was done the same time as the narrel and was the removel of the siglite rear night sight and tru glo front tritium fiber optic combo sight, in favor for trijicon rear and front tritium night sights. I found that after much shooting the fiber optic combo front sights fiber optic would fall out ( apparently its a fairly common occurrence).

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game."

From Tactical Medical Solutions website:

""One of the most physically and mentally challenging situations an individual can face is casualty evacuation. Casualties must be moved quickly and safely. Every second wasted decreases the casualty's chance of a speedy recovery. The Foxtrot™ Litter provides an effective casualty evacuation platform that is quick and easy to employ and compact enough to accompany individuals on an assault or long movement.

The Foxtrot™ Litter is small enough to attach to your kit or another bag, but is still functional in a combat or rescue environment. It provides a rapid means of casualty movement without compromising durability, flexibility, or the individual's ability to maneuver through the most demanding environments. Casualties can be dragged or carried off target without excess time spent rigging and securing. It also eliminates the wait time for a conventional litter to be brought from the breach point or a support vehicle.
Features of the Foxtrot™ Litter

    Light and Compact (4.6 lbs with carrier)
    Size allows movement of casualties through narrow passages and walkways such as on aircraft, buses, and trains. Casualties can be sat up to make tight turns on stairwells and hallways.
    Rapid deployment drag line already rigged to litter.
    Multiple grab points ease passage through tight areas.
    Quick secure straps.
    Casualty is secure but accessible for reassessments and care.
    Can be dragged or carried.
