This Raging Bull has less than 200 rounds through it and is incredibly smooth when shooting, comes with the original box/papers, a soft case, and a camp shoulder holster, can send more pictures if needed


The Original Raging Bulls are still among America's favorite hunting handguns. Chambering the popular and powerful .44 Magnum and 454 Casull rounds, the mighty 444 and 454 revolvers are built for a lifetime of tough use. Offering award-winning designs in four distinct barrel lengths, these monsters feature a crisp trigger break and smooth pull for accuracy, cushioned grips and factory porting to reduce felt recoil.

	Dual lockup cylinder Provides stability under extreme chamber pressures.

Cushioned insert grip
Exclusive on the RAGING ™ Series large frame revolvers, Cushioned insert grip pillows recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
 	Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
 	Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
 	Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

This model does not have night vision settings, and features the (generally preferred) 2 MOA dot versus the standard 4 MOA dot.  Please note this mount sits lower (1.2"" optical centerline from top of rail) than standard Aimpoint mounts, and if you have a standard AR-15 front sight this mount will not work.  It is intended for non-AR firearms, or AR's with a folding front sight.  The only parts that show any use are slight wear marks on the underside of the mount where it attaches to the firearm (completely hidden when mounted, and in no way alters fit/function).  Comes with a set of flip-caps, box, manual,  batteries, and Aimpoint synthetic body cover.  If bought new from Larue Tactical this combination would cost the better part of 200 dollars more expensive than asking price...save yourself some dough and take mine off my hands!  Not looking for trades, but you never know if the right one came my way!

Generic info on Aimpoint ML3:  

Unique features for CompML3
Designed for day use, including dusk and dawn
New ACET technology allows 50,000 hours of operation on one battery
Available in 2 dot sizes (2 and 4 MOA)
Submersible to 135 feet (45 meters)
Comes with replaceable outer black rubber cover

Generic info on Larue LT152 mount:

Designed for the RASII, but equally at-home wherever a short mount is desired.
This QD mount for the Aimpoint Comp M2 is 1/2"" shorter than the standard Comp M2 mount to fit a RAS II. It has a 30mm ring and hard-locks to any Picatinny rail.

The LT152 positions the centerline of the optic 1.20"" above the top of the rail.

Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and matt black anodized to provide a durable non-reflective surface finish. The locking LaRue Speed Lever provides outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed."

I am not really into collector value, I am into common and practical... I am definetely not desperate, and I am happy to keep it in the hard case in my trunk if no collectors want to trade.

If you are unfamiliar- There is an Armalite AR7 that happens to be listed in springfield right now- there is lots of info about the rifle in his ad.
He has his listed for $600- his is in nicer condition but only comes with one 7 rd mag- 
I googled an Armalite ar7 that sold at auction on gunauction's website in 2010 with a 7 rd mag and nicer sling for $566 -

Mine is not as nice of condition- but I think mine is a way better package- I have three- 20 round magazines for mine- the one that sold in 2010 only had one 7 round mag. Check out the price of 20 rd mags... I think you will be satisfied this is a better package. 

Also- I am a fan of spare parts- so I have a couple extra SETS (2 sets of 2= 4 total springs) of action springs for the AR-7

I am looking to trade for a common ruger 10-22 + cash or .22 GSG or Chiappa pistol +cash... 

I know that the Henry AR7 rifles are much less expensive, please don't be the genius who wants to tell me about that...If the right collector does not come along I am very happy to keep it:)"

Below is the info taken from the Trjicon website.

Trijicon Bright & Tough(TM) Night Sights are three-dot iron sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive, they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights feature a unique shock-resistant design. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil. Green lamps are warranted for 12 years from the date of manufacture."

Attached is a photo proving that this is steel core. The black tar-like substance located at the bottom of the bullet proves it. The ammo is individually boxed in original twenty round boxes. The boxes themselves are collectible. You will be hard pressed to find this ammo for this price. I have physically cut open one round and pulled the bullet out of the casing to prove that it is steel core. Do your research and see what this ammo sells for. It is highly coveted by AK and SKS shooters everywhere. Thanks for looking.

I have seen colt troopers with the nickel finish bring a premium on different auction sights. I am only asking $550 for this one. I do not have the original box or paperwork.

It's in nice shape and looks well built, rivets are nicely done. The guy I got this from said he'd purchased it and was told who the builder was at that time but couldn't recall the name.

It's a Circle10 kit built on a NDS receiver with Tapco US parts, hammer/trigger/gas piston for sure. Comes with 1 Tapco 5.45 mag as pictured. 
In good overall shape, with some honest wear on it. Mostly the selector rubbing on the receiver which is normal.

Functions great, always goes bang, always extracts and is accurate enough. I've slayed more than a few prairie dogs back in Colorado with it a few years ago (last time I shot it actually). It's a great little 40 year old gun."

Selling because I have no use for it in my own collection and need the cash for other more important things. It's a Century Arms imported AK74 that has been converted using a Izmash-based Bull-pup kit. The fore-arm (forward portion) of the kit is not original and was custom built for this particular firearm by the previous owner. I have had no problems with it holding zero with my EOTECH. The gun fires and works flawlessly. As a reminder (might be informative for some) that this particular bullpup kit utilizes metal linkage for the trigger/firing mechanism so it's a bit sloppy which is TYPICAL. If you're expecting this rifle to be a .25 MOA 1,000 yard rifle then this isn't for you. This is in fact an amazing run-n-gun firearm that I've used in a few different games. It's compact allowing you to utilize in positions that you would struggle with other guns. Accuracy wise, it's a 1.25-1.5 MOA rifle at 100 yards. Most of my experience with this rifle has come from well under 100 yards, where it shines brightest. I did at one point have the intention to bring it back to it former glory (with buttstock!) but opted to keep the bullpup as it fit perfectly.

New Benelli Super Sport 12 ga/. 30"" ported barrel
The Benelli SuperSport is the ultimate choice for a fast 12-gauge shotgun for sporting clays. This Benelli shotgun is truly a “speed gun.” The SuperSport’s ComforTech® recoil-dampening system allows the shooter to recover for the critical second shot up to 69% faster than with other comparable shotguns! Couple the quick recovery speed with a ported barrel that keeps muzzle climb to a minimum and it’s doubly fast. And the ComforTech® system’s special gel recoil pad and comb insert reduce felt recoil by up to 48% compared to the competition. When one clay often separates the winners from the losers, the SuperSport with it's superior reliability, faster recovery time, lower recoil and denser shot patterns, is almost like having an unfair advantage. 12ga with 30"" barrel,no trade please,ship to ffl dealer only"

I will list this as ""used"" for the simple fact there is no box or paperwork with the firearm.  It honestly looks like it has never been shot.  It was carried as a personal defense gun according to the previous owner, but I don't see any indications that it was ever fired.  The laser works great and I don't see any dents, dings, scratches or rust anywhere on the firearm.

With intentions of building a upper assembly. But then bought a complete upper. So I have no need for this one. 

I know they say blemished. But the upper looks pretty nice to me. Has a few swirls in the coating. But otherwise looks nice. If your not overly picky you may not even notice it's blemished.

I am asking $50 for it. That's what I paid. Just looking to get my money back. It can be picked up in the Concord area. Or I will ship it to you. You pay whatever it costs to ship. I may consider trades for other AR parts. I am looking for grips, quad rails, magazines, etc.

The weapon retails for $650 plus tax and the two spare magazines were an additional $60.  

Will sell for $575 cash FIRM (this is my low).

The XDm comes with everything as new (holster, mag pouch, back straps, etc.).  I’ve also purchased two additional 13-round mags that are included.  

Meet F2F, bill of sale and I’ll need to see your driver’s license or conceal carry permit (won’t take any info from them).  

Worst case, I’ll keep this XDm and probably learn to love it – but while I’m in my current state of mind, hit me up if you’d like to trade."
