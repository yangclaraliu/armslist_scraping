I bought this from a LOCAL GUN SHOP for $1,799.99 plus tax (8.5%) and 4% credit card fee. The rifle is NEW, still in the box, and has never been used. The rifle will come in the original box with all the manuals and TWO steel factory 20 round mag. I'm asking $2,000.00 which is a little less then I paid for it just 10 days ago. I bought the rifle as an impulse buy and i'm regretting not waiting and buying what I really wanted. The buyer must meet in Norman or Moore area and have CASH. The rifle now has a Magpul MOE GRIP and will come with the factory grip as well. I won't sell it for less then I paid, so please don't send me low ball offers. I also have a brand new in the BOX leatherwood CMR Hi-Lux 1-4X24mm scope for $300.00"

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.

To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.5mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

The first 150 rounds were fired 30 at a time, slowly, with a quick barrel cleaning between each set of 30. It has only been fired rapidly twice, less than 100 rounds each time. It has been treated very gently. Basically, it comes to you in ""like new"" condition, used enough to prove that it functions flawlessly, but not enough to create any wear. I am located in Snohomish, WA. I will not ship this item. This is a face to face private sale only. You must be a CCW holder and have valid WA ID. We will fill out a bill of sale including this info and you will need to sign it. If this is a problem for you, we can't deal. I have to make my effort to keep my gun out of ""the wrong hands"" as long as it is within my control to do so, and make sure that the trail for the authorities to follow does not end with me if it becomes an issue.

Workers’ Compensation covers medical expenses and lost wages for an employee’s job related injury or illness, even if the employee is at fault for his or her own injuries. Unfortunately, many workers that are injured on the job fail to collect the compensation they are entitled to or give up because of resistance they get from the workers’ compensation insurance company. 

Just because the workers’ compensation system is frustrating does not mean you should not pursue your claim.

Contact Ganim Injury Lawyers and they can alleviate most of the frustration you would encounter. There are a multitude of things they can help you with while handling your case, including: 

•	Securing workers’ compensation benefits even though you have not stopped working 
•	Ensuring that your workers’ compensation benefits continue even if you obtain a new job, move away or retire 
•	Depending on the injury, you may be entitled to workers’ compensation payments for the rest of your life 
•	We can help you collect additional benefits, known as Schedule Loss Awards, if you qualify. 

Keep in mind that your benefits can be lost forever if you do not file your claim on time. If you have been injured or suffered an illness while on the job, you and your family will need the full range of workers’ compensation benefits that are available.

I have decided to part with her. Selling a Jennings Model 25, 25 ACP semi auto pistol. I am a certified Glock armor who often take trades on jobs I do. I have also owned a few of these and they can be a sweet pistol for the money. Most people will fire these then put them in their pockets full of lint and never maintain them. They also will use cheap ammo that is not hot enough for blow back causing feed problems. This one will fire all day long and eat up the 50gr ammo without a single issue. I will include a box of quality hot ammo and have smoothed out the ramp for a flawless performance. Nice little back up pistol or pocket pistol for the money. I sell them all the time but this one is my baby and they move very quick so no stupid offers or e mails.  Thank you"

As soon as this rifle was released I knew I had to own one. I've had 10/22s with Butler Creek's Packer stock which allowed the easy removal of the barrel without tools so the gun could be easily carried in a backpack or small duffel and made for an excellent bug-out tool. But the problem with the Packer stock was that the barrel fit loosened over time and became inaccurate. Ruger fixed all that with this model and is now their most sought after (and nearly impossible to find) .10/22. Once I found one I immediately installed a new Simmons Protarget scope using Talley's rings that mount directly to the receiver so the Weaver rail that typically shoots loose after awhile is bypassed. This Simmons scope has target turrets, Truplex reticle and a ballistic dial calibrated for .22 long rifle rounds. Because this rifle has never been fired it will be up to the new owner to bore sight and zero the scope. All packing for both the firearm and scope are included. 

The following description is from Ruger:

Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. is proud to introduce the Ruger® 10/22 Takedown™. Readily separated into two subassemblies, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers a convenient transport and storage option for the popular Ruger® 10/22®. As reliable and accurate as every 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America's favorite rimfire rifle by your side. 

The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the subassemblies, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly. The lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero, even when receiver-mounted optics are used.

The Ruger 10/22 Takedown is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves which hold the subassemblies. External pockets with MOLLE webbing provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other accessories. Multiple attachment points for the padded, single shoulder strap offer different carrying options.

The 4.67-pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37"" long when assembled; each subassembly is less than 20 1/4"" long when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action and ten round rotary magazine (one magazine is provided), the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers legendary 10/22 reliability in a compact and portable package."

Looking to see what kind of interesting offers I get. If the ban goes into effect, then semi-auto shotguns with pistol grips like this one will be banned. 

The 930 SPX Blackwater Edition:

Tactical 12 Gauge Shotgun With 18.5″ Barrel, XS Ghost Ring Rear Sight, AR-15 Style Front Sight, 8 Shot Extended Capacity & Full Length Pistol Grip Black Synthetic Stock. Fixed Cylinder Bore Choke. “Blackwater” Logo On Left Side Of The Receiver.  Chamber both 2 3/4 inch and 3-inch 12-gauge shotshells with ease—from target loads, to non-toxic magnum loads, to the latest sabot slug ammo.

Basically these were made for Blackwater Security. Same as the 590A1 and the Sig Sauer P226 9MM Handgun. They are no longer in production and hard to come by. Only way to own one now is IF the owners of them now were willing to sell them. 

You can still purchase the standard 930 SPX for around $865-$1000. But the Blackwater Tactical Edition is hard to come by, it's basically wanted because of the name. So it tends to draw more attention and highly sought after.

Honestly I have all the firearms I need. But I won't turn down making a few extra bucks on something I own that others want. The standard model 930 SPX are going for $1000 on Gunbroker now. The MSRP on them new were $865. 

I however will keep your offers in mind, but I will be keeping an eye on gunbroker. It might end up on there. As there are very few Blackwater editions.

If you read the bill, your shotguns that have a threaded barrel for your chokes and has the potential to hold 5 rounds will be considered an assault weapon, your 9mm pistol that holds more than 10 rounds and is easily reload able, and a removable mag will also be on the list. And are you really going to voluntarily  go down to wherever you need to register these guns and have a background check, mug shot, and fingerprinted? I seriously doubt that! Read the bill, then lower your rifle prices back to normal. Keep the high cap mag price up though, that's what they want this time. Because if you read it, then a 9mm with a 10+ round cap mag should be worth what you are asking for your rifle! PLEASE READ THE SUMMERY OF THE BILL!"

This is a free-market economy last time I checked so it is perfectly legal for people to raise prices based on demand and it will come back down once the supply catches up, if a bill does not passes right away. Am I going to pay these ridiculous prices? no, If you do not want to pay these inflated prices all you have to do is wait for the prices to come back down, if they do. 

Following is a summary of the 2013 legislation:

    Bans the sale, transfer, importation, or manufacturing of:
        120 specifically-named firearms
        Certain other semiautomatic rifles, handguns, shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine and have one military characteristic
        Semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds
    Strengthens the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban and various state bans by:
        Moving from a 2-characteristic test to a 1-characteristic test
        Eliminating the easy-to-remove bayonet mounts and flash suppressors from the characteristics test
        Banning firearms with “thumbhole stocks” and “bullet buttons” to address attempts to “work around” prior bans
    Bans large-capacity ammunition feeding devices capable of accepting more than 10 rounds.
    Protects legitimate hunters and the rights of existing gun owners by:
        Grandfathering weapons legally possessed on the date of enactment
        Exempting over 900 specifically-named weapons used for hunting or sporting purposes and
        Exempting antique, manually-operated, and permanently disabled weapons
    Requires that grandfathered weapons be registered under the National Firearms Act, to include:
        Background check of owner and any transferee;
        Type and serial number of the firearm;
        Positive identification, including photograph and fingerprint;
        Certification from local law enforcement of identity and that possession would not violate State or local law; and

I have a complete AR-15 lower I'm considering trading for an upper.

The stripped lower is a DPMS (by the time I got it, I couldn't get my hands on a Rock River), the trigger group is a Rock River 2-Stage National Match, and the stock is a Rock River 6 position Operator stock.

I'm mainly interested in a Rock River complete upper - preferably new in the box, unfired.  But I'll consider others, if they're interesting, and of high quality.

And if you've got something to offer that exceeds the value of this lower, we can talk about a trade/cash deal.  I'm happy to exchange sales receipts so we both know how much money we've got in the deal.

If you're going to offer a sportical upper (or similar) that cost you less as a WHOLE GUN than this lower cost me, you can give it a try.  But I'm unlikely to play.

Let's see what you've got!

Update:  I'm starting to get emails offering to buy this lower outright for cash.  Thanks very much, but I really AM looking for a TRADE that concludes with an upper in my hands instead of cash."

This particular example is in very nice shape but has seen light use there are a few odd scratches here and there and some worn metal on the front sight but she fires and looks great i have seen worst exchanging hands for $850 and comprairible for $900 if you are into the series or would like to get into it this is a great little gun that has ALOT of life left in it.

Tula Emperor Peter The Great Ordnance Factory.After trials of several different repeating bolt action designs Russia adopted a new standard infantry rifle in 1891. It fires the 7.62x54r cartridge and is a combination of designs by Russian Sergei Mosin and Belgian Leon Nagant whose primary contribution was the magazine and feed system. The official Russian designation is “Three Line Rifle, Model of the Year 1891” but is more commonly known in the US as the Mosin Nagant M91. A “line” is a unit of measure equal to 1/10th of an inch. Production of the M91 took place at the Russian arsenals at Izhevsk, Tula, and Sestroryetsk. Due to a slow start in domestic production a contract was issued to the French arms company Chatellerault who built around 500,000 M91s. During WWI contracts were issued to the American firms of New England Westinghouse and Remington for 1.8 and 1.5 million rifles respectively. M91s were widely used in WWI and can be found with markings from many different European countries that purchased or captured them.

This Rifle probably seen action in both World Wars.

Sold pending funds
Also included is just shy of 100 rounds of the FMJ 7.62x25 FMJ ammunition for the gun. The ammo is readily available online and at Cabelas. 

There are several hodge-podge mismatched guns like this for sale on Arms List with no accessories or ammo, poor condition, for what I'm asking. No-nonsense price of $450 cash, well under what guns of this condition sell for on gunbroker.

What you need to know: The gun's cartridge shoots a necked case round that can build high pressure and operates on the same ballistic principles as the FN Five seveN. Military/Police agencies have access to bullets for this gun that circumvent class II kevlar body armor so the Brady Campaign has seen fit to target these types of guns/ammunition for special ban consideration. You obviously cannot buy such law enforcement only ammunition but it nonetheless makes the gun a very likely to be banned on the principle that such ammo exists somewhere in the world. 

Here's the quote from wikipedia, check out the wiki article for the sources:Due to its muzzle energy, higher pressure FMJ ammunition fired from the CZ 52 pistol will penetrate even NIJ II rated ballistic vests,[4] or the PASGT helmet.[5] 

The gun is Curio & Relic FFL 03 eligible. Illinois residents require a FOID card and valid State ID to purchase the handgun. No shenanigans, the sale will be lawful in every way.

JP sent  the comp to Delta P in order to have the comp black oxided so the finish matched perfectly. The owner at Delta P will then cherry pick and ensure the adapter hand index before TDC. The comp and adapter was  sent back to JP Rifles where they were placed on a lathe and indexed to the individual adapter. There will be no crush washer used!

This item started life as a Remington 700 Police short action in .308. Improved the trigger to a match trigger by Timney and then improved on that. Bolt was trued and faced. Tactical oversized bolt handle is great in cold weather with gloves. Remington 20 minute elevation scope base installed, will accept any pic rail type rings from anyone. The original stock was packed away and will be included in the sale which is a standard glass/Kevlar black stock. The current stock is an HS Precision vertical grip stock which makes shooting with gloves more comfortable, and gives you a straighter grip. This stock was invented by the Israeli Military and has been hugely successful. I use it now on all my Army builds, particularly the M24. The stock includes a height adjustable cheek piece, and a length of pull adjustment, so anyone can shoot this rifle easily as it will fit anyone from Huge men to small girl and everywhere in between. Includes a sandbag strapped to the rear, a relatively new snipers rig that I was testing and found that I liked. This is a 26"" rifle with no brake and will come to you with the original stock which can be re-sold, the original trigger parts, if ever needed, original box, sling, harris bipod, scope base. Note in the photos, this rifle has received substantial expensive gunsmithing including the magazine feed modification and comes with 4 ea. 10 round magazines. This bottom metal is ALL METAL and represents about a $500 upgrade. This is extremely accurate in the 1/4-1/2 minute range with good ammo and a qualified shooter. The finish is black parkerized for all weather use. A scope of your choice and ur ready to go. It is professionally broken in and ready to shoot. The relative value including the smithing and upgrades puts it in the $3000 range, so it’s a good deal at $2000. Stock and bottom metal and 4 mags alone are $1300. If you have a scope and rings, and send them to me, Ill have it installed, and bore sighted for you at no additional cost."

The $200.00 NFA tax will apply and your local law enforcement will have to sign off. Fingerprinting and photographing is required. ""Assault weapons"" not already in private hands will be banned and the NRA, which has a copy of the bill text indicates that transfers of ALL ""grandfathered"" ""assault weapons"" including transfers to family members are prohibited. ""Grandfathered ""assault weapons"": WOULD HAVE TO BE REGISTERED IN THE NFA REGISTRY AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. Magazines over 10 rounds are banned without additional details. There are no provisions for school security (because this isn't about safety).The ban of course will do nothing to stop mass shootings or other crime. As soon as the next mass shooting occurs they will come back with a confiscation bill and go door to door.

 Suggested email/letter text: 

 Dear,

 I am writing you regarding the numerous gun control schemes currently being proposed. I strongly oppose any additional gun control measures, including, but not limited to, those restricting magazines or so called ""assault weapons"". Guns are not the problem. If guns or access to guns were the problem, then Vermont, with some of the most lenient gun laws in the country, which doesn't even require a permit to carry concealed, would not consistently have some of the lowest homicide rates in the nation. Just 1.1 homicides / per 100,000 population in 2010, which was about 1/4 of the national average. So much for argument that availability of guns increases homicide rates. 

 With regard to ""assault weapons"", which are really just semi-automatic rifles; these guns are rarely used in homicides. For example in 2011, according to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, rifles, including ""assault"" rifles were used in 2.55% of homicides. The UCR does not track how many of these specifically involved an ""assault"" rifle, however, it is obviously less than 2.55% for 2011 since that is the total for ALL rifles combined. By contrast personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.) were used as the murder weapon in 5.75% of homicides in 2011 and knives and cutting instruments were used in 13.38% of homicides. Other years are similar. 

 The UCR 2007 - 2011 homicide by weapon tables are here: 

 www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8 

 There is simply too little criminal use of these so called ""assault"" weapons which are really just semi-automatic rifles used lawfully by millions of Americans, for regulation of them to make any difference in our crime rates even if criminals obeyed laws, and, they don't. Connecticut had a 'gun free' schools law and an 'assault weapons' ban. Neither had any effect on the school shooter there, other than perhaps to guarantee his success by insuring that he was the only one armed. Compare the Sandy Hook tragedy, where nobody but the killer was armed, to the 1997 Pearl Mississippi school shooting where Vice Principal Joel Myrick was able to retrieve his handgun from his truck (it was illegal for him to possess or carry it in the school) and apprehend the shooter, Luke Woodham without Myrick firing a single shot. Luke Woodham's admitted plan after attacking his high school, was to go to the local Jr. High and continue his rampage there. Myrick stopped that plan cold. Unfortunately, there was no ARMED Joel Myrick at Sandy Hook. In another incident, in 2001, senior Jason Hoffman opened fire at Granite Hills High School in El Cajon, California. Hoffman wounded five people before being shot and incapacitated by, ARMED school resource officer (a police officer) Richard Agundez.



 We don't need more gun control, which has failed over and over every time it's been tried. We need real security, not useless 'feel good' measures that strip us of our constitutional rights for the mere illusion of safety. We need ARMED police officers in schools. These officers can provide security from all levels of threats as well as serve as badly needed role models for the children they protect. Giving the Joel Myricks of our country the ability to legally possess the guns they need to responsibly protect themselves and the children in their care wouldn't hurt either.

 Sincerely,
