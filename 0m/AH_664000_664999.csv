Comes with everything sent by Ruger (i.e. manuals, lock, mag, scope rings, and more). Again, I opened the box to look at it, put it back in the plastic and there it sits. IN NEW CONDITION.

This is model 5846 with the folding & collapsable ATI stock and pistol grip. Very well made and feels great in your hands. Extend the stock for varmint hunting or fold it down for home defense. Great rifle.

Asking $850 OBO, but will consider serious offers or trades. Mostly interested in AR15 platform.

********************************
HISTORY
The history of the Ballester-Molina dates back to 1929 when two enterprising Spaniards, Arturo Ballester and Eugenio Molina established a company for producing Hispano-Suiza automotive products in Buenos Aires. The name of this company was Hispano Argentina Fabrica de Automoviles Sociedad Anonima (HAFDASA), or Spanish-Argentine Automobile Factory, Incorporated. Several years later, HAFDASA hired a pair of engineers, the frenchman Rorice Rigaud, and Carlos Ballester Molina (a member of both the Ballester and Molina families). Rigaud eventually became HAFDASA's chief design engineer, while Ballester Molina, originally responsible for metallurgy, heat treatment, and production methodologies, became HAFDASA's Chief Executive Officer (CEO). 


HAFDASA won a contract with the Direccion General del Material del Ejercito (DGME), or General Directorate for Army Materiel, to supply the Argentine military with trucks, buses, and engines. The DGME later commissioned HAFDASA to investigate the potential manufacture of small arms. 

In 1936, in response to the DGME request, HAFDASA began to design and manufacture small arms. There was nothing revolutionary about HAFDASA's work. The factory established a pattern of adapting existing designs to satisfy the requirements of the Argentine military and police forces using indigenous materials within HAFDASA's production capabilities. To this end, in 1936, HAFDASA unveiled a semiautomatic carbine based on the Beretta M1918/30 in calibers 9x19mm and .45 ACP. 

Following the introduction of the two carbines, the DGME requested HAFDASA to produce a pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge to serve as an (indigenously produced) replacement for the .45 ACP pistols then in service with the Argentine military and police forces. The contract required HAFDASA to produce a pistol along the general lines of the Modelo 1916 and 1927 Colt pistols then in service and to have barrels and magazines that were interchangeable with those pistols. 

The HAFDASA engineers began work on this contract in late 1936/early 1937. The decision was taken modify the original Browning design to facilitate and economize production along the same lines as two Spanish companies Bonifacio Echeverria, S.A. (Star) and Gabilondo y Cia, S.A (Llama). The main changes introduced by these companies were the elimination of the grip safety, a backstrap integral to the frame, and a pivoting trigger with a side mounted sear bar and disconnector. These changes, as applied to the Star Model B pistol were of particular influence to HAFDASA's designers. 

Consequently, while the completed HAFDASA design bore a strong external similarity to the Colt M1911A1, only the barrel and magazine are interchangeable with the Colt pistol. Note: Barrels and magazines made by HAFDASA are identifiable by the marking ""HA"" inside a diamond. The following is a list of differnces between the HAFDASA pistol and the M1911A1: 

a) The hammer strut on the HAFDASA pistol is much shorter than that of the M1911A1. 
b) The firing pin stop on the HAFDASA pistol is not recessed on the side as it is on the M1911A1. 
c) The safety lock on the HAFDASA pistol is redesigned with a larger diameter pin, and it can be applied with the hammer cocked or fully down. 
d) The mainspring housing on the HAFDASA pistol is an integeral part of the frame. 
e) The HAFDASA pistol has a pivoting trigger with a single extension along the right side that cams the side mounted disconnector and engages the sear. 
f) The magazine catch on the HAFDASA pistol is assembled differently. 
g) The HAFDASA pistol has no slide stop disassembly notch.
The HAFDASA pistol was adopted as the Argentine Army service pistol in 1938. Early pistols were marked ""Pistola Automatica Calibre .45 Ballester-Rigaud, Modelo DGME 1938."" These early pistols have checkering on the grips and backstrap, and there are twenty fine slide retraction grooves, as on the M1911A1. The slide right side is marked with the Argentine crest and the text ""Ejercito Argentino."" 
The next iteration of the HAFDASA pistol were modified to speed up and economize on production accordingly: The backstrap checkering was replaced by horizontal serrations, the wooden grips had long vertical serrations, and the fine slide retraction grooves were replaced by groups of vertical grooves separated by wide gaps. Additionally, the Modelo 1938 designation was dropped, and the pistol was now known as the ""Pistola Ballester-Rigaud."" 

At some point between 1940 and 1942, HAFDASA changed the trademark name of the pistol from ""Ballester-Rigaud"" to ""Ballester-Molina,"" with the change reflected in the markings on the slide of the pistol. At the same time HAFDASA began to use plastic, instead of wooden, grips on the pistol. It was also around this time that HAFDASA received an order from the British government for between 8,000 and 10,000 .45 caliber pistols. Payment for these pistols was made, in part, with steel supplied by the British government. Due to the scarcity of raw materials in Argentina due to the Second World War, it is highly likely that the steel was of U.S. origin supplied to England via Lend-Lease, and consequently not prior to March 11, 1941. According to Alejandro Gherovici, noted expert on Argentine service pistols, no steel salvaged from the pocket battleship Graf Spee or any other warships was used to produce the British contract or any other HAFDASA pistols. Production of the British Contract pistols started in 1942 and continued until mid-1944. British Contract pistols are easy to identify as they bear a serial number prefixed by a ""B,"" between the 12000 and 21000 serial number range. 

After the end of the of the British Contract, HAFDASA continued to produce pistols for Argentine government and commercial usage until 1953. Starting in 1947, the HAFDASA pistols had been supplanted in Argentine use by the DGFM Sistema Colt M1927 pistol, a clone of the M1911A1. While the HAFDASA pistols began to be withdrawn from Argentine service in the 1960's, many served until the mid-1980's when they were finally replaced and sold as surplus on the US market. It is believed that HAFDASA produced between 80,000 and 90,000 .45 caliber pistols. 

The following is a loose serial number to year correlation: 
Serial Number Range Date Range 
1 - 12,000 1938 - 1942 
12,000 - 23,000 1942 - 1944 
23,000 - 108,000 1944 - 1953 


HAFDASA exported pistols to Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela."

Most of these you will see anywhere are used and the price I am asking is barely over the average used price and less than what many are asking.  I know of 4 that recently sold on TGT for $900 to $1100. 

Brand new with manufacture's warranty. This comes with a bayonet lug and flash hider. Also included are Two (2) G3 alloy magazines, 20 round capacity and trigger lock.

This rifle was made with the highly desirable stamped steel receiver (not the cast receiver, which can break). These are getting harder to find as this comes from the last manufacturing run. Get yours now before the inevitable price increase.

I look at the gun shows every time for these and used/new have ranged in price from $850 to $1300.  I am asking $900.  At the last Freeman show I went to I saw four total.  One dealer had two one new one used the new one was $1100 and the used one was $900 and in my opinion looked awful.  I found a second dealer with a new one that looked pristine and was $1300 which was excessive in my opinion,  Finally I found a gentleman walking around asking $850 for his used rifle that looked pretty beat up to me.



These are easy to modify and a blast to shoot.  I absolutely love my tricked out cetme with quad rail bipod foregrip collapsible stock which was very inexpensive to do and still love shooting my standard one with iron sites just as much.



If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask.  I am willing to consider trades if the offer is right.  What interests me most is, Sig P238, Springfield XDS, Springfield XD 357, Springfield XD 40, Springfield XD Mags, Umarex H&K 416 Pistol, Kel-tec KSG.

Permit or CCL. In/near Asheville NC.
It appears unlikely that I will be offered a carbine, so I am concentrating more now on a hi cap 9MM pistol, i.e., Beretta 92, Taurus PT 92/99, etc.

The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from their REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features their enhanced fire control group. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

This exceptionally quiet pistol is made up of two parts: the Ruger Mk. III .22 LR pistol, and the lightweight custom Titanium AWC suppressor, combined together in a striking fashion. The result is an extremely accurate, lightweight weapon.

This Amphibian S comes equipped with high-visibility adjustable night sights, a frame-mounted American-style magazine release and a loaded chamber indicator. The 7” overall length makes for easy handling and transport, and the durable stainless finish ensures that the Amphibian S will handle a lot of wear and any climate and terrain. 

The Ruger Mk. III is equipped with a loaded chamber indicator, which will always let you know when a cartridge is in the chamber. The gun also includes a manual safety, and the internal cylindrical bolt ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than typical moving slide designs. 

The Amphibian S is much lighter than any of the previous variations because of AWC’s new baffle design; the new baffle utilizes a 303 stainless steel primary baffle and a lightweight Titanium secondary baffle. 

Ruger also includes Weaver rails as a standard upgrade for connecting sights and other accessories. This suppressed semi-auto is so quiet, the sound of the bullet hitting the dirt was louder than the report. It’s a great addition to your handgun collection,"

Selling it to fund a separate project. This revolver was made when Taurus produced licensed copies of older model Smith and Wesson revolvers and has one of the best triggers I've ever used outside of a Smith or Colt. In the time I've owned it I've put about 300 rounds through it without one failure to fire or other malfunction. It does show some holster and carry wear and there is a spot on the right side of the frame where a Brazilian police placard was placed and subsequently removed. While there is some wear, there is not one spot of rust anywhere on this VERY reliable revolver and with the Taurus life-time warranty (confirmed on the phone by Taurus before I purchased the pistol) you can't beat the price.
