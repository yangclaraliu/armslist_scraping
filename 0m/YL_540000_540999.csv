A revolutionary rifle design—the HK SL8-6 is constructed almost entirely of a reinforced carbon-fiber polymer. Based on the combat-proven G36 rifle used by the German Army, the SL8-6 uses a proven short stroke, piston-actuated gas operating system, well known for simplicity and reliability.

Designed and engineered to deliver exceptional shooting performance, the SL8 is a favorite among European target shooters, due in large part to its modular construction and free-floating bull barrel. A short Picatinny rail mount is standard and allows accessory optics to be easily added. Made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process, the SL8-6 barrel ensures accuracy and long life. The ergonomic and clean lines of the HK SL8-6 are functional and modern, giving the SL8-6 the look and feel of a 21st century firearm.

We have 11 spots left in our upcoming North Carolina CCH / CCW Concealed Pistol Training class this Sunday.

The course is instructed by seasoned firearms instructor, Roger Pettit.
Roger is fully licensed and fully insured (Lloyd's of London) and we hold the class on an actual gun range. He has a great sense of humor and has great stories being he's an ex-marine, bounty hunter, and has worked with multiple military contractors. The cost of the class is $85 a person OR $150 ($75 each) if you bring along a friend. This price is ALL INCLUSIVE meaning this price includes course work, red book, certificate, drinks and pizza for lunch, and Roger even supplies guns and ammo if you choose not to bring your own!!! No tricks or gimmicks here! If you don't have experience, no worries! Roger will get you up to pace during the class. If you've done any research on CCH you know $85 is CHEAP and alternatives NEVER include this much. The classes are small (10-20) and Roger has years of experience teaching them in multiple states. If interested let me know and check out the website info: www.PCShooting.com.

The next class is September 23 rd. Location is 20 minutes outside Cary, NC down US-1 at LCWC.

Email if interested as seats are limited. Email can be found on our listed website.

BE PREPARED for any possible madness come the end of this year!

Hope to see you there!

Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well.  Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle, our latest take on this innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 3.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear.

Below is what I have for trade.  I can include cash for the right deal. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

1. Rock River AR-15: This is an upgraded M4 style (military tacitical style with short, lightweight barrel). It has an upgraded RRA Operator stock (as opposed to the standard RRA tactical stock on the unfired AR), a free float quad rail (as opposed to the standard handguard that you can't mount anything to), a winter trigger guard, front flip up sight (instead of stationary), a tactical muzzle break, two-stage trigger (very nice trigger), ergonomic grip (as opposed to the standard hogue), and a chrome lined barrel. It has two magazines through it and is in perfect condition (no blemishes, scratches, scuffs). I also have a bunch of accessories: extra magazines, ammo, Lucid HD7 red dot sight with 3x magnifier, soft and hard carry cases. The Lucid is an awesome red dot.  I have it installed on another AR I have, but have never shot the AR with the sight mounted to the gun. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

2. Kimber 1911: It has new Trijicon night sights. It's in perfect condition. I have everthing it came with originally and a bunch of extra aftermarket and factory magazines (after markets are actually known to be more reliable than the Kimber mags). I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

3. Glock 21sf: .45 caliber Glock with the short frame (""SF""). The SF style has a more manageable slimmer grip. Feels a lot less like a brick! It has new Meprolight night sights. I have over 10 magazines for it. Excellent condition with everything it came with originally. I have other Glocks as well, but not sure I can part with them. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

4. Sig Sauer P238 Gambler: This is a limited edition by Sig. It's similar to the Rosewood edition but has the word ""The Gambler"" etched in gold on the side of the slide and a ""dead man's"" poker hand on the top. It is no longer being manufactured by Sig, so it has collector value in addition to being one of the best pocket pistols available. It has not been fired and is new in the box it came in with one magazine and a paddle holster.  It has the new style snag free night sights.  I also have a Crossbreed Minituck for it as well (best IWB holster you can buy in my opinion).  The holster is made to fit the gun with a Crimson Trace laser attached to the trigger of the gun.  I have the laser as well. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

I would rather not sell it but my card had an unauthorized charge on it and they froze it so I need the money for gas to get back and forth to work. Included are two pictures here and the rest on my Flickr page because there are more than you can download here. This will fit the Glock 23 and I would assume any standard rail that isn't subcompact as it also fits on my Smith and Wesson M&P 15-22. Thank you for looking.

This is a collectors grade rifle. No re-arsenal markings or signs of refurbishment anywhere on this rifle. It has all matching numbers on the bolt, carrier, stock, receiver, receiver cover, magazine, trigger guard, rear sight, and gas tube. It has the original blade bayonet, original cleaning rod, original cleaning kit, 10 stripper clips, 200 rounds of Russian match grade 7.62x39 ammo, and case. The bore is bright and shiny with strong rifling. The bluing is original and none of the pats have been painted over later. The stock is its original dark hardwood finish and has the original serial number without being forced matched and having a bunch of XXXXX's over the old serial number. The stock has no cracks or deep gouges, just minor handling wear. The receiver cover is marked with the Tula star inside the star logo and has the date stamp of 1952r under the logo. I bought this gun over a year and a half ago and it has sat in the safe ever since. I have never fired it, and never planned to in order to keep it in the collectors condition it is currently in. I know what this gun is worth as would any serious SKS collector so please don't try to low ball me and compare this with the Yugo's and Norinco's out there. Take a look at gunbroker for similar condition rifles and you will see that there are few out there and are worth every bit of my asking price. 

Asking $675 obo and I am not looking to trade, only sell outright at this time. I am located in Dublin and if you want to buy this, you must be willing to meet me in this area. My job doesn't typically allow me time to travel beyond the Dublin area. If interested, email or PM me. Thanks for looking."

She is built to get looks and shoot straight all day long and does it very well. The coolness factor is just through the roof with the custom touches and I get asked about and complimented on it constantly. Plus since it’s a .22 it’s a great rifle if your friendly because you can pass it around the range and talk to people without burning a hole in your pocket with ammo. That being said a lot of .22s are finicky with ammo this one isn’t. I built it to shoot everything and I’ve got a very large mixed box of everything from super high velocity hollow points to the standard lead nose blazer ammo and I mix and mingle with no loss of accuracy or failure to feed.
Okay lets start from the back and work our way forward. She has a rubber shoulder pad not for recoil just for comfort and a full length sling mounted to the 6 position mil-spec collapsible stock. The grip isn’t stock and I forget who makes it magpul  I think sitting on a custom trigger in a custom painted lower receiver. I added red and white accents to make her stand out plus with the pain I added to the fire selector its not a lot easier to tell where it sits at a glance. I used automotive grade bright white and Viper red. The trigger has a 4lb spring it from JP and a gunsmith polished trigger effectively reducing the trigger weight by half. She is by no means a hair trigger so no accidental discharge but on a weapon this like those 3 lbs I shaved off greatly aid in accuracy.  
As we move forward we come to the fore grip with the remote pressure switch for the light which is fully functional on two modes, ON and STROBE. This light is a 240 lumen LED and she is blinding but still very light and out of the way. There is a red dot optic on top with 4 reticle choices and 0-7 brightness with zero being off. I was concerned about the red dot washing out the light was so bright but even on the brightest day outside there is no issue.  There is a full rail system on the weapon which is all polymer as is the stock so it’s a very light weapon. The flash suppressor isn’t stock, I had the factory bird cage removed and I have a demon glass breaker as well as a barrel shroud suppressor which will accompany the gun. 

I am also including the iron sights.
If I can’t find the factory trigger springs and grip I will either reduce the price to compensate for their absence or replace them at the buyer’s request."

Silver keeps going up.  You might have plenty of ammo and guns but do you have silver.  At last check these rounds were going for $33 to $35 each on ebay.  Diversify your position.

Email me or phone to let me know what you have.  I will get back to you.  Not that it matters with a long gun but I am a Wisconsin resident.  I am legally able to own and purchase firearms.

I am the original owner and I've only used it lightly. Its in really nice condition as you can see and it shoots great. Its perfect for when you can't conceal anything larger! It comes with a hard plastic case and two magazines (one original and one aftermarket). I will also send you at least one used holster for it -- two if I can find the other one! The price is $210 (postal money order or cashiers check only) shipped to the FFL in the lower 48 of your choice. The gun will ship after payment has cleared and my FFL and received a copy of your FFL's license. Sale is of course final, so please ask any questions prior to buying.

For local buyers, I've had a past experience selling a firearm locally and privately that wasn't the best in the world, so unfortunately you will have to go through an FFL. You can come to my FFL who is also located in Lake Worth, or I am more than happy to have the weapon shipped to any FFL of your choice. Please keep in mind that if you do not have a concealed permit that Palm Beach County has a waiting period of I believe 5 days, so if you are not close to here, you should pick a FFL close to you to avoid having to make the drive twice. 

I can be reached by email at REDACTED. Please note that this item is listed on gunbroker (more pictures can be found there) and is first come, first serve.

I'm the original owner and the gun is very lightly used and in great shape. If you've done your homework you'll know that some people aren't huge fans of the trigger pull on the Sigma -- I am NOT one of those people -- all of my pistols have heavy trigger pulls and I absolutely adore this gun! If I didn't need the money I'd certainly keep it. In the time that I've owned it, I've put less than 400 rounds through it and it truly has performed far better than I ever would have expected. It comes with two factory magazines and a reversable IWB holster with a thumb clasp. This model is definitely not the most comfortable gun to wear concealed and so I've only done it a few times, but perhaps you don't mind carrying such a large weapon (heh). Anyway, the cost is $285 shipped to the FFL of your choice in the lower 48. Payment is to be by postal money order or cashiers check from a major financial institution only. The gun will ship after payment clears and my FFL has received a copy of your FFL's license. The gun is in great shape and performs flawlessly, but it is being sold as is and all sales are final, so please ask any questions you may have before purchasing! 

For local buyers, I've had a past experience selling a firearm locally and privately that wasn't the best in the world, so unfortunately you will have to go through an FFL. You can come to my FFL who is also located in Lake Worth, or I am more than happy to have the weapon shipped to any FFL of your choice. Please keep in mind that if you do not have a concealed permit that Palm Beach County has a waiting period of I believe 5 days, so if you are not close to here, you should pick a FFL close to you to avoid having to make the drive twice. 

I can be reached by email at REDACTED. Please note that this item is listed on gunbroker (more pictures can be found there) and is first come, first serve.

627,http://www.armslist.com/posts/540627,"For Sale/Trade:  bowies, butterfly knives, and other stuff","Yukon, ok, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 60,"Listed On: Friday, August 31, 2012",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"here i have a bunch of knives, detail this list as much as possible,

two of the bowies, (the ones that dont have the holes in the blade that also dont have the grip knuckle protector around the handle) those ones are HERO EDGE brand, chinese probley. bought at the flea market on my many visits as a kid. the survival knife used to have a kit in the screw off cap of the bottom of the handle.  that one i have also lost the sheath to on a fishing trip as is 5$
the black bladed one is also a survival type knife, like the other heros edge knife i am selling for 5$ this one also has a serated back edge. i have the black nylon woven sheath for this one and it comes with a wet/sharpening stone.it has hole loops for a belt to be slung on. i like this particular knife alot because the grip almost feels like some kind of rubber/plastic hard mixture. i will sell this one for 10$

the other knife that is a higher quality nicer bowie is NOT a heros edge brand, seems like it just says stainless steel on the blade and was a gift to me. i have a leather belt holster for it also. it is very aerodynamic holes have been cut in it to allow it to be lighter and faster. it also has a hand/knuckle protector. i really have no use for this knife, but since it is so nice i will sell it for 15$

then we have all these butterfly knifes, all of them but the silver one are ""stainless china brand"" lol they are varying in price. 10$ for the very very large green one,(its very big!) 10$ for the silver Rostafrei brand one, and 5 bucks for the red one and 5 bucks for the cheap pirate one. i have bought the cheap pirate one simply to have been converted to a training blade which i did. so there you go it is a simple training butterfly knife with no tip and no edge for 5$ the latch was on the wrong side so i just completly cut it off. as always the latch is on the sharp bite side on all these besides that pirate training one that does not have one at all.

there is also a pair of paperweight(paperweight because what am i ever going to do with these) black brass(i say brass because thats what there known as) knuckles. more than likely there made out of some type of steel., there very tough but i have no use for em. 10$ 
i also have what appears to be a police type folding baton. it extends decently long giveing me a whole nother arms reach in length. it also has a leather holster that comes with it with loop for going on a belt. 10$ for this one also.

i am positive this is a great deal for 60$ for all this stuff, i mustve paid atleast well over 100$ for this stuff alltogether i have no time or use/space for. i just want to get rid of it. 


if you have any questions or trade offers text or call me at 1REDACTED

i would take 60$ for all of the stuff if youd like."

SIG Sauer German. 40 Cal Smith and Wesson semi auto pistol. It's excellent condition with less than 500 rounds fired. One of the sweetest trigger double and single action pulls I've seen on a factory pistol. Its never jammed and is quite accurate. It comes w 3 12 round cap factory mags and 1 10 cap magazine, factory case, manual. 1 box of 50 target ammo and the 3 12 round mags are loaded with Winchester Ranger hollow point self defense loads. It comes with a left handed inside the waist band leather holster. This is the same model that many us military and law enforcement agencies carry. Its a mid 90s model. If you know SIGs you know the older models are sought after as new production offerings have been known to have quality control issues, thanks to CEO Cohen emphasizing cosmetics over craftsmanship. New they go for $850. I'll accept $649 for everything to first responsible person who can legally own as handgun."

The DOA 600 reticle is the scope's centerpiece, however, as it dramatically extends your effective range and helps you judge a buck's trophy quality in record time. Short for Dead On Accurate, DOA technology features Rack Bracket reference lines, which help you accurately gauge the size of whitetail and mule deer antlers at distances that are difficult for standard optics. Because these lines represent the distance between an average deer's ears, you'll know the approximate distance once the lines fit the image.

Below is what I have for trade.  I can include cash for the right deal. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

1. Rock River AR-15: This is an upgraded M4 style (military tacitical style with short, lightweight barrel). It has an upgraded RRA Operator stock (as opposed to the standard RRA tactical stock on the unfired AR), a free float quad rail (as opposed to the standard handguard that you can't mount anything to), a winter trigger guard, front flip up sight (instead of stationary), a tactical muzzle break, two-stage trigger (very nice trigger), ergonomic grip (as opposed to the standard hogue), and a chrome lined barrel. It has two magazines through it and is in perfect condition (no blemishes, scratches, scuffs). I also have a bunch of accessories: extra magazines, ammo, Lucid HD7 red dot sight with 3x magnifier, soft and hard carry cases. The Lucid is an awesome red dot.  I have it installed on another AR I have, but have never shot the AR with the sight mounted to the gun. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

2. Kimber 1911: It has new Trijicon night sights. It's in perfect condition. I have everthing it came with originally and a bunch of extra aftermarket and factory magazines (after markets are actually known to be more reliable than the Kimber mags). I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

3. Glock 21sf: .45 caliber Glock with the short frame (""SF""). The SF style has a more manageable slimmer grip. Feels a lot less like a brick! It has new Meprolight night sights. I have over 10 magazines for it. Excellent condition with everything it came with originally. I have other Glocks as well, but not sure I can part with them. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

4. Sig Sauer P238 Gambler: This is a limited edition by Sig. It's similar to the Rosewood edition but has the word ""The Gambler"" etched in gold on the side of the slide and a ""dead man's"" poker hand on the top. It is no longer being manufactured by Sig, so it has collector value in addition to being one of the best pocket pistols available. It has not been fired and is new in the box it came in with one magazine and a paddle holster.  It has the new style snag free night sights.  I also have a Crossbreed Minituck for it as well (best IWB holster you can buy in my opinion).  The holster is made to fit the gun with a Crimson Trace laser attached to the trigger of the gun.  I have the laser as well. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

5. Sig Sauer P220 Carry Equinox: never fired, a few extra magazines. Has TruGlo TFO night sights. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL."

A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" model.
The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.
Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.
With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 - 8.5 pounds (27.5 - 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7N).
The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.
Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.
A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike.
Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines.

Kimber Pro Carry HD  - .38 Super -

Compact and Pro Carry pistols have 4-inch bushingless match grade bull barrels fitted directly to the slide. Chambers and triggers are also match grade. They are easier to carry and conceal, and are perfectly balanced.

Like some full-size Kimber pistols, both Pro Carry RL models have an integral Picatinny rail for light mounting. Along with TLE and designated night sight models, they also have Meprolight® night sights. 

All Kimber pistols have slide serrations with beveled edges that will not snag clothing or holsters. Serrations are deep and wide to ensure positive grip even with wet or cold hands.

Chambered in .45 ACP, 9mm and 38 Super, Kimber mid-size pistols are an ideal compromise of size and weight. With a variety of options and features, they cover every need from duty and concealed carry to home defense. More importantly, these pistols do not compromise quality or dependability. The Tacoma, Washington, P.D. extensively tested Pro Carry models, finding them to be the most dependable firearm put through the paces in over 20 years. They checked the records, comparing Kimber not only with other pistols, but rifles and shotguns as well. When you carry a Kimber, you carry with absolute confidence.

This is THE best all around .22 tactical assault riffle out there. It has a nice scope that is zeroed in and super accurate. 2 30-round banana style magazines and original 10-round clip. Fun and cheap to shoot all day long. Why buy a .223 ar-15 that you can't afford the ammo for. It was only a special run that Remington made so there are not that many out there for sale. This one I found brand new this year and has about 1000 round through it. Just been cleaned and oiled. 

I will throw in a resetting metal target gallery and a few hundred rounds of ammo. If you are serious and able to come to me, you can try it and I will set up exploding targets to shoot at. VERY FUN! 450 or best offer"

This fine piece of machinery is a Rossi matched pair, break action, single shot youth gun with a 20 gauge MAGNUM shotgun barrel and a .22 long rifle barrel. You can swap barrels without tools in less than a minute, by unscrewing the forend sling swivel. 

The gun is light, and compact enough to throw in your bugout bag when taken down. The overall length of the shotgun when assembled is 36"" (the .22 is even shorter), and the longest part when taken down is a diminutive 25"".  If you're thinking of getting a handgun for the apocalypse, but don't have the time, energy, or cash to go through the NY permit process, this is what you need!

Worried about someone snagging your gun without proper authorization? You have to sleep sometime, afterall. This one has an integral, key operated, child safety lock right on the receiver, so security is no problem!

The gun comes with a varied assortment of ammunition, a catalog of which will demonstrate its great versatility:

	50 rounds - Federal .22 LR 40 grain solids - Can you say squirrel stew! These heavy solids are great for target practice, but also give you the MASSIVE PENETRATING POWER that you need for busting through the squirrel's tough outer shell!
	45 rounds, #8 birdshot - Good for birds, squirrels, rats, even zombies when they're right up close!
	10 rounds, #5 birdshot MAGNUM (3"") turkey loads - Outstanding for blasting up Thanksgiving dinner and making your friends' shoulders hurt when you let them try out your new SHTF gun!
	5 rounds, #3 buckshot - Great for coyotes, zombies, or bad guys that might attack you while hiking in to your bugout location!
	8 rounds, 3/4 ounce rifled slugs - After a few weeks of squirrel stew and coyote burgers, you may want a nice deer steak. These will cure what ails ya!
	5 rounds,  Brenneke MAGNUM (3"") 1 ounce slugs - The Big Dog! These have a picture of a damned grizzly bear on the box! Never mind about the measly black bears that we have here in NY. If you don't develop a pervasive sense of security hiking through the apocalyptic hellscape with a few of these crammed in your buttstock shell holder, you need medication!

You also get BONUS STUFF! Buy now, and I will throw in:

	1 Uber-tactical, perfectly fitted, MOLLE compatible shotgun scabbard to attach to your appropriated horse, Jeep, or nightstand! You can even strap it to your tactical load bearing vest and meet TEOTWAWKI Book of Eli style! 
	1 supercompact and stylish, soft sided, take-down gun case!
	1 ultralight, black, synthetic fiber, shoulder sling for super easy carry afield!
	1 buttstock shell holder to facilitate your badass SPEEDLOADING technique!
	Not one, but TWO Plano, stacking, lockable, 20 gauge shotshell cases!
