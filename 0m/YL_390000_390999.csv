Sorry no trades.

The Kimber Stainless Target II sets the performance standard for production 1911 pistols. This model offers adjustable sights, a satin silver finish and is stainless steel. Common features include the Kimber Firing Pin Safety, designated by “II” in the model name, along with rounded and blended edges for comfortable carry. Barrels, barrel bushings, chambers and triggers are all machined to exacting match grade dimensions. Ejection ports are lowered and flared, and sights are mounted in dovetails machined into the slide.

All Kimber pistols in centerfire calibers have a Loaded Chamber Indicator Port. When a round is chambered and light is available, the shell casing should be visible through the slot at the rear of the barrel hood.

All slides and frames are paired in the early stages of production and travel through the factory together, ensuring optimum fitting of every part. This is one reason Kimber pistols have unequaled performance and dependability. Custom features like high ride beavertail grip safety, extended thumb safety and Commander-style hammer are part of every Kimber pistol. All parts are made inside the Kimber factory, ensuring quality control. Model: Kimber Stainless Target II .45ACP

While taking pictures with the handguards on the upper, I managed to put a couple more scratches on the barrel under the handguard. I have shown this in the picture s.

psl(century, romak ect is all fine)
saiga's of all kinds, but really looking for a 12 ga or 410
a 1911
an fal, r1a1
an ak
I'll consider other trades as long as it's not mil-surp bolt rifles or any 22's unless you've got a badass 10/22 and some cash on top of it. not really looking for cash, but the price would be 850 firm if it went that way. DO NOT MAKE AN OFFER IF ITS NOT A FIREARM OR CASH, tired of always get asked if i want random crap. I'm in tacoma, prefer ftf in the seattle/ tacoma area. Let me know if you want more specific pics or have any questions. Thanks

This Blackwater Tactical is no longer in business and this Item is discontinued. The Blackwater Tactical is a full sized 9MM with a stainless slide with rugged wear resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE rear night sight, a Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and features a short reset trigger (SRT)that is 60% shorter for faster return and better control during faster shooting. The beaver-tail frame is hard anodized light weight with integral Picatinny rail.The slide comes with Blackwater logo on top and the grips are also engraved with the Blackwater logo.Some of the Blackwaters features are a custom mag well, double action trigger is 10.0 lbs, single is 4.4 lbs, length is 7.7"",width1.5"", height 5.5"",Barrel 4.4"", sight radius 6.3"", weight with mag 34.0 oz., mag cap. 20 w/ 4 mags.
I believe they started production of the Blackwater Tactical in 2009 and ended in 2010. This is a Blackwater TACTICAL, it is one of the very few that does not have front slide serrations, because it is one of the first ones produced, then they changed the design.  This was manufactured in Jan. 2009.  You can confirm this with a  toll free  call to Sig Sauer.
This has had 40 rounds shot thru one magazine. The 3 other 20-round magazines are still sealed in factory packaging.
This firearm is immaculate, all factory packaging and paperwork.

Here's discription:

Introduced in 2000 & Desigend by Ken Onion, which offers customers an innovative, even easier, way to deploy Kershaw's popular torsion-bar, assisted-opening technology. It's called the Speed-Safe Index Trigger. The 1580MCST means (serrated blade, multi-colored handle). ""Instead of pushing on a side thumb stud, the new Boa models let the user push his index finger forward against a raised part of the back of the blade which is accessed from the back of the knife,"" says the knife's designer, Ken Onion. ""This short push deploys the patent-pending Speed-Safe, torsion-bar technology. The blade moves into position smoothly and easily and locks into place."" In addition to the Speed-Safe Index Trigger, the Boa boasts a unique, handsome look and top-quality Kershaw construction. All Boa models feature a 3 3/8-inch, CPM440V stainless steel blade, honed to Kershaw's famous edge. The heavy-duty handles are made of 6060 T6, hard-coat-anodized and textured aluminum. Boa Model 1580MCST offers a spectacular, multi-colored, anodized and textured aluminum handle in turquoise, purple, and black. The liners are heat-treated 410 stainless steel and the lock is Kershaw's Liner Action lock,

 12-42x56 Precision Benchrest Riflescope
Each of our Precision Benchrest models feature 56mm multi-coated lenses, providing the superior resolution necessary to distinguish fine detail at extremely long ranges. An adjustable objective allows extra-fine focus to adjust parallax from 25 yards to infinity. Target turrets are calibrated in true .125 M.O.A. (1/8 click) values and can be re-indexed to zero after sighting in. Both Precision Benchrest riflescopes are equipped with a coil spring plunger return system to maximize tracking accuracy. The eyepiece provides fast reticle focusing, and a glass-etched illuminated reticle provides optimum image/reticle contrast under virtually any lighting conditions. You have two choices of magnification ranges. But only one choice in the ultimate benchrest riflescopes.

      Will email additional photos on request. Less than 1000 ""1969"" models on the planet, according to collectors. Great shooter. Very collectible, and will only increase in value. Willing to email additional photographs to show  closer details of this classic rifle. This rifle was manufactured in 1969 in Gramsh, Albania. I believe it had a short life in either a War time  engagement or Albanian Law Enforcement. This gun was at some point exported to Knoxville, Tennessee for civilian sale. This rifle does not appear to have been ""re-armored"". The history of the Albanian S.K.S. is very interesting to read about and brings a curious attraction in itself to the gun. It shoots accurate and is very well made. Original sling and original bayonet. It is an excellent ""collector"" gun, yet at the same time, a serious intermediate hunting rifle, great deer rifle, and a serious survival tool. Make no mistake, this is not just another S.K.S. rifle. This one is ""topshelf"". I already regret selling it, and its not gone yet. But when you need to come up with money for medical cost, it's a ""no-brainer"". I have every intention to aggressively look for another ""Alby"". after owning this one, I would only purchase another Albanian S.K.S. I am not saying that other S.K.S's are inferior, I just like the unique features of this one. Will not ship, face to face only, will travel to meet."

I am open to buying from a dealer or an individual.  Other considerations would be perhaps a Saiga conversion, Zastava conversion, very selective Century AK's(probably no WASR's), possibly others.  I am not looking to spend a fortune or even a small fortune.

Also, I would be willing to consider other semi-auto military style rifles, such as AR's and others, on a case by case basis, so long as they are not too pricy.  Remember I am on a an AK budget, and somewhat of a budget AK budget, at that.

It has also has a pressure release button in the chance that you travel on plane for shooting events. If you decide you wan to replace the center piece of foam, do not purchase the foam online. Simply measure out the foam piece and go to Hobby Lobby and purchase the same exact size for around $5 rather than spend $15-20 to have it shipped from the company. There is no difference in the quality, texture etc... as I am repeating what a customer service rep told me when I called concerning this issue. My Asking price is firm on this case. I will not come down another $20 because you have to go a buy another piece of foam, that is why I am only asking $120 and not the usual $250 with shipping that these things cost shipped.

From Sig's website:

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Check out the videos on YouTube of the power of the Taurus Judge..For home protection its in a class of its own.
