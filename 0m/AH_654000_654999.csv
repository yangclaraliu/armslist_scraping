This pistol is based upon the specs for the Series 70 Colt, so there's no lawyered-up features to interfere with lock time and performance. The features on this pistol are: 
1) Skeletonized trigger and hammer
2) Beveled magazine well
3) Flared ejection port
4) Serrations on the slide in the front and rear for quick operation and release
5) Micro adjustable rear target sights
6) Dovetailed front and rear sights for easy replacement and customization. 

The pistol has light wear and is extremely tight and accurate. I've fed it full metal jacket and hollow point with no FTE or FTF. There's little wear on it, so the round count's not that high.

The pistol comes with the factory box, test round, manual, and two 8 round MecGar magazines. I'll throw in a Pachmayr .45 SnapCap to boot for safe dry fire drills. 

The price is firm because this is a quality pistol. I'm selling it because it's been a safe queen and I've got another project I want to fund.

The action has NOT been drilled for a scope. The inside (bottom) of the rear sight show slight rust, it will clean up fine once it's disassembled for cleaning. 
The stock has been replaced with a Sporter stock and shows light scratches, normal wear in my opinion. A Pachmayr recoil reduction butt pad has been added. 
Chambered in 7.65 x 53 Argentine, there is an old box of 150 grain PSP that comes with it. Not sure that I'd shoot them, I'd probably sell the box on eBay for $30 - $40. 
I am a licensed professional gunsmith (Form 4473 required to purchase). I'm selling this rifle as is, if you want me to dress it up and make it look better it will cost more. 
This rifle was recently found for sale in a magazine for $299.00. Will consider trade against US made handgun or long gun; AK or SKS."

I've not cleaned or performed any work on this one (it does need cleaned). Will consider trading against US made handgun or long gun; AK or SKS."

Pistol, holster, reloading/display stand (which comes in really handy at the range), full pound of FFFG powder,powder horn, powder measure, 500+ percussion caps, 2 of the tools for putting on the caps, a handful of balls (40 - 50-ish), ball bag, wads, nipple wrench and a possible bag in which to hold it all.

The pistol did not see much use so it is in very good shape, the holster has a small amount of damage that is mostly on the inside of the trigger guard when the gun is holstered, some of the tools have a bit of corrosion but nothing that couldn't be cleaned relatively easily with a little elbow grease.

This gun is really fun and cool to shoot and is much more accurate than one might expect. I just don't get any use out of it."

It has wear on it from a holster but overall in good shape. It does not like cheap bulk federal ammo tho. They are anywhere from $300 to $450 on gunbroker and from 250-400 on here. $260 also comes with a cheapo holster

Second is a Rohm model 66 .22 revolver. It's in really good shape considering these guns usually don't keep thier nickle well. Has a little wear on the hammer but bearly any drag marks on the cylinder. $150

I can't post pics at this time from my phone, but I can email or text them to you.

I'm looking for a lc9, pf9, shield 9mm, or other compact, single stack 9mm for carry.

Thanks for looking. Email or text 614- three nine five -6768"

I have owned this shotgun for 2 years, have shot it sparingly and cared for it well.  See photos for condition.

Like many of these fine old shotguns, this one has a hairline crack where the stock meets the receiver on the right side (note closeup in last photo).  There are no visible cracks on the forend.

full-size Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger
pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly
larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in
familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and
right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately. The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line.

It needs a new battery and tires. I have new signal brackets for it. I put one on, but haven't put the other 3. Also I have another front end for it that has not been put on. As seen in the picture. Comes with a helmet. As far as repairs it will need the carburetor cleaned out. It has been sitting since spring. The clutch needs to be bled for pressure. You can inflate the tires, but they will eventually leak out.  They also are worn to much to be safe. The gas flap on the inside of the tank is flipped up. If I pure gas in it, it will leak down into the oil. The clutch and gas flap are easy fixes, but I'm not going to put any time into it at the moment.

This bike being fixed up runs for $1400-1600. I have estimated how much labor/materials would go into fixing it up. This is why I have it at the current price. If it were running with all the above fixed it would be listed for at least $1400.

The upper receiver is made by Del-Ton Incorporated (DTI). It has a 16"", M4 contour barrel with a carbine length gas system.

The upper has M4 feed ramps, a flat top with T marked rail slots and a forward assist. If it wasn't for the 16"" barrel, you would not know the difference between this and my M4 in the army. I have installed a magpul MOE handguard with rail system, a knights armament vertical fore grip, a magpul back up iron sight, and a multi reticle primary arms red dot sight with cantilever mount (All included). The lower is made by Plum Crazy Firearms. It is semi-automatic only (legal). It has a 6 position collapsable stock. I have installed a new back plate that accepts a single point sling (included).

This is a very high quality, mean looking rifle. It holds zero and functions flawlessly.

For those of you not familiar with this, it means they are along the lines of a machine gun or short-barreled shotgun in that their transfer and ownership is closely regulated by the BATF.  Pen pistols are normally AOW's for the sole reason that they don't look like a gun.

The Stinger must be folded before it can be fired   It folds to form a ""handle"" to grip and even a little trigger drops down.  This made it look enough like a gun to have the BATF classify it on June 7th, 1990 as an ordinary pistol

I have three nice Busse family knives here

I have one of each from the various Busse family operations. As you may know these are all produced in limited numbers and mostly preordered and rarely run again. All of them use various unique and superior steels. They exceed your expectations in every way and they also retain thier value.

1) The Busse Game Warden in ""Muddy"" with Tan Micarta scales is the cream of the crop. This one appears to have never been resharpened from factory. I never have and I see no real evidence of it. It is dam sharp though. A Busse classic the Game Warden and so marked. *** $250.00 for this one alone



2) The big Black one is the Scrap Yard ""Scrapper 6"". This one has been used and shows scuffs on the finish on the blade which is a black coating. it obviously has been used and should be used. Great chopper and camp knife as well as a nice big combat knife of above average quality. Made from the Busse family ""scrap yard"" line. This example is ""sterile"" so not marked. *** $150.00 for this one alone



3) And the third one, probably the second most valuable of the three one to the Game Warden is the Swamp Rat (another Busse company) line ""HCLE"" (Hairy Carry I think its called?) with Dark Green Micarta scales (might as well be Black in most light). This one also appears to not have been sharpened or used. An excellent example. No sheath. It is the middle one in the picture. It is marked. *** $200.00 for this one by itself.



You will be hard pressed to put together three finer classic examples of these knives from this manufacturer. You may make a reasonable offer on any individual one, or on the set. I would prefer to sell these as a set to one lucky collector. That's why I have discounted it for that purpose.

This thing shoots great!  The 270 is a great flat shooting hunting round.  The bolt is one of the smoothest that I have run and the accutrigger is great and has a light crisp break.

I will include the brass for all of the rounds that I have shot through this gun if you plan to reload (460 or so).  All brass is once fired and mainly Federal, but there is a mix.  Great for reloading.

Call, text or email me if you have questions.  This setup costs $950 new, it is yours for $550 o.b.o.

I will be back and forth between Fort Collins and Denver over the long weekend and could meet you anywhere in between.

Thank you,

This is my little gun shop, and I'm out to change the game one gun at a time. The world is changing, but the way most gun shops operate still leaves alot to be desired. Outrageous pricing, impersonal ""service"", trade-in gouging, and more focus on selling what's on the shelf than finding the gun that will serve your needs. It's time for something new.
