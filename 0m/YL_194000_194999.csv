The one pictured has a choke, but I don't know which one.  Slug barrel is included too, just not shown.  Condition is good, and is ready  for deer season.  It has been shot but how much is unknown.  Probably more than once and less than a thousand rounds. Vances is selling this same gun for $449.99 + tax.  So, I think $350 is a fair price.

SOLD!!!! Next is a Taurus PT 25.  This is a .25 cal with 9 shot mag.  Excellent condition.  Includes box & papers. Shot it a few times, and it has been sitting in the safe ever since.  Would make a great pocket pistol.  From my research, it looks like this gun goes for anywhere between $250-$280 retail.  So, I think $200 is fair. SOLD!!!!

Prices are relatively firm, unless you can show just cause that they're too high.  Trades ae welcomed.  FTF in Columbus.  Not interested in going much further than that.  Of course, you're always more than welcome to visit my lovely city if you wish.  Must be proper age and prove it.  Don't email me to ask if something is still for sale.

Disclaimer: Yes, this is a Century rifle. They seem to get a bad rap, but this is definitely one of the good ones. I'll put it out there now: there were rumors of some Tantals being built with 5.56mm barrels. [B]This one was not.[/B] It has the proper barrel and is very accurate, and has never keyholed a round at any range. This rifle has never had a single malfunction through the 1500+ rounds I put through it. I believe I put over 500 in a single day at the Kalashnikov Combatives course I attended this summer. Not one hiccup. This rifle was supposed to see me through the apocalypse but...I just need the money right now.

Condition: Very good. One mark on topcover, wear marks on receiver at safety and where topcover mates with receiver. Bolt carrier was coated at some point but has worn off from use. Bore is smooth, shiny and rifling is pronounced. Cleaned properly after every shooting session.

Very accurate for being iron sighted.  $200 obo local pickup and Cash.  Thanks

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Features contrast sights. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. Two finishes are available; Two-tone and corrosion resistant Nitron. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

Light as a feather. The 625 Series is one of the best selling Citori over and under shotgun lines ever. With this high level of success some gun companies would just sit back and keep selling the same basic product. Not Browning. The Feather 625 field guns couple the 625 Field with our popular Feather Technology to make an over under shotgun already regarded as the best looking and finest handling -- even lighter and faster than ever before. Feather Technology replaces the steel receiver with an ultra lightweight alloy model that provides more than a full pound of weight reduction. Of course, lighter weight doesn't mean light duty.  Even with the alloy receiver, the strength and longevity of your Citori 625 Feather are not compromised. The Feather shotguns rely on a solid steel dovetailed breech face and steel hinge pin, both areas of high wear on an over and under, to take the brunt of the forces that act on these critical components.
With their reduced mass, 12 gauge 625 Feather models weigh about the same as a 20 gauge Citori, but with the advantages of faster handling and pointing, and a larger shot payload. This weight reduction also means a Citori 625 Feather is much easier to carry during a long day in the field. Shoulder a Citori 625 Feather and understand for yourself how a little less can actually be so much more.
If your looking for a lightweight, upland hunting over and under shotgun to carry all day long in the field hunting for doves, grouse, quail, chukar or pheasants (what have we missed? Perhaps Hungarian partridge and snipe) look no further than the Citori 625 Feather.

Technically, the S.A.F. is a recoil operated select fire gun, firing from closed bolt. The triger/hammer group and floating firing pin design is similar to SIG 540, but the bolt is of new design. The receiver is similar in design to SIG 540, and is of folding type (upper and lower receivers are assembled by two steel pins, much like the M16 receiver does). The S.A.F. has ambidextrous safety/fire selector switch with four settings - safe, single shot, 3 round bursts and full auto. S.A.F. SMGs are manufactured with side-folding or fixed polymer buttstocks. Silenced version, with folding buttstock and integral silencer is available for special forces use. S.A.F. has post front sight, ajustable wor elevation, and aperture rear sight, ajustable for windage. S.A.F. uses 20 or 30 rounds magazines made from transluscent polymer. Magazines had special studs and slots that allowed two or more magazines to be clipped together for quicker magazine change.contact directly via .....vigilar7@hotmail.com"

In 2001, DPMS expanded from its share of the .223/5.56mm market, and exploded onto the .308 rifle scene. The LR-308, the first and foremost of the .308 line, and for which the rifle series is named, is a rifle to be reckoned with. So much so that it was named the NRA Rifle of the year in 2005.

With a 24” fluted stainless bull barrel, 1 in 10 twist, free floating handguard and a high ride receiver for easier mounting of optics, the LR-308 has gone toe to toe with bolt action rifles and delivered comparable accuracy, with higher magazine capacity and rate of fire. The conventional thought that ""only a bolt action could be considered a precision rifle"" has been in contention ever since.

The LR-308 is the ultimate long range target and competition rifle. As for hunting: a deer, coyote or black bear doesn't stand a chance!


On top of this sits a Norinco 3-9x40mm mil-dot scope, sighted in & ready to go!

I'm looking to preferably trade, but will sell, my Witness .45. It's a full-size, double-stack handgun based on the CZ-75. It is the steel frame model.

The gun is flawless in function, I've run about 850-1000 rounds through it without malfunction. The springs have just been changed out for new extra power springs, and I have both the original set and another, unopened set of extra-power springs. The finish is almost perfect, it's just got one small blemish beside the mag release but other than that no scratches, no wear. The gun comes with three extra magazines, the spring-kits, and an OWB belt holster. 

It's been a wonderful carry gun, but recently I've been bitten by the 1911 bug, so I'm looking to trade it. 'Budget' grade 1911's are fine, in-fact I'd prefer to trade it for one of the bare-bones Rock Island or even a Norinco 1911, plus a little bit of cash or accessories, etc. 

I'd also be interested in trading it straight across for one of the Rock Island or Springfield 1911a2 double-stack .45's. A Para P14 would also be considered, I'd prefer to trade straight or trade down but I'm always up to negotiate. I might consider other .45 pistols, but I'm only looking for full-size models.

Other than handguns, I would consider trades for a WASR/AMD-65/etc AK clone + cash, SKS + cash, Draco or mini-Draco ak pistol + cash, lever-gun in .357 or .45-70, 'Tactical' semi-auto 12ga, or perhaps other guns, just let me know what you have. 

I'll try to get some pictures up tomorrow. Feel free to email me with any questions and thank you for your time."

The 5"" long Government Model (pictured above) is the best single stack duty, defense or competition pistol you'll find in America -- the best quality, the best value and the best performance. No wonder so many of them show up at IPSC Limited Class matches. The Premier II© is even guaranteed to shoot 3"" groups at 50 yards! We've sold so many in the USA and abroad, the Premier II has become the flagship of our line. It performs like a million bucks but it costs a whole lot less.

I recently purchased this gun because of it's reputation for accuracy and the accu-trigger.  the gun shoots excellent as expected but after taking it out the first time to site it in, I realized its not quite what I wanted for my purposes which include hiking to multiple sets over several miles while coyote hunting.  The trigger is fully adjustable and on the lightest setting registered at 1.25 lbs.  The free floated 22"" barrel has a 1:9 twist which enables it to stabilize the heavier match bullets.  Although heavier than a standard rifle it is lighter than most rifles with a heavy barrel and geared toward predator/varmint hunting.  I put less than 25 rounds through it and the gun is in excellent condition.  Please call Bill at REDACTED with any questions."

The 915 was made for 1-1/2 years starting in 1993 and ending in March 1994 when it was replaced by the model 910 during the Clinton ban on Hi Cap mags.

This one has been fired but not much, and I don't think it was carried much either because it still has the (experimental) paint job, or enameling Smith and Wesson used on this pistol.

The frame is Aluminum with a carbon steel slide making it light weight for a full size pistol, and an excellent carry weapon.

Stock site's with single white dot on front.

Being one of the 59XX series of Smith's, the magazines will fit just about any of the double stack 15 round pistols, so if you have other models with 15rd capacity they will work fine, and they also work on 6906.

This pistol comes with two 15rd.Red bottom mags and two 15rd.black bottom mags.

All the one's I have seen no longer have the paint on the slide and have been blued, this one still has the original finish on it.
