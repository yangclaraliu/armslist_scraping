Reason for trade is because I need to cut down on the number of firearms I own and conserve space. I'm only interested in the 308 as I have yet to by an AR type rifle in that caliber.

Both my rifles have less than 300 rounds through them and cost $1295 (AK-103) and $1695 (AR-15). I will send detailed pics to anyone with a serious request. Both guns come with carry cases.

This link shows mount LT-111 at the $1,754 total. I upgraded mount to SPR-S (Prod# LT-158) to place scope's centerline height at an optimal 1.44"" and added 10MOA of adjustment range that is built into the mount itself. The LT-158 positions optic's 50mm objective at only 8mm above top rail on hand guard for precise fit to rifle. It also raised cost from $1,754 to $1,799.

Thanks for looking and please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions. I prefer a face to face transaction in the local Denver area, but will also consider shipping within the contiguous 48 states to an FFL of your choice. Buyer will assume responsibility for shipping costs which will be determined upon receipt of verified FFL address. 

Thanks again,

This is what it will come with it, included in the price:

Scope mounts

If you know guns you know this is a fair price for the package. However, price is negotiable, but only serious buyers, please. I take private transactions very seriously. We will fill out legal documents for the transfer and it will require valid VA state ID and preferably a CCW permit with it. I will not sell out of state unless we do an FFL transfer. 

At this time, I am not very open to trades. Cash is king, but I might be willing to take a handgun with a value of 600$ or less and knock it's value off the price for a trade+cash transaction. I'm actually looking for a new conceal carry and very, very interested in the Smith and Wesson M&P Shield. 

Any offers feel free to send my way. Worst I can say is no. Just keep it reasonable."

I've had the rifle for several years and it has probably less than 200 rds through it. I bought this rifle because I might go elk hunting one day. Well several years later I haven't hunted with a rifle in awhile and I never take this rifle to the range because it's got too much recoil for me. I have taken a deer and a hog in Florida with this rifle and if you hit them anywhere in the body, they will not go far.

The rifle is sighted in at 100 yds within about an inch. I don't have a lead sled or the fortitude to get it any closer free hand.

If your looking for a rifle for a deer stand, especially one in a field, this rifle's for you. I wanted something with a flat trajectory so I could take it elk hunting one day. Check out 7mm RM ballistics on the internet; if you sight in at 100 yds, you should be able to hit a deer inside of 300 yds without much trouble at all.

The HD model was more expensive than the entry level models. It features Sig's ""Siglite Night Sights for fast and easy target acquisition. The Hogue black G10 grips provide a stunning contrast to the natural stainless steel slide and frame. Includes a holster, one magazine. Weighs just 18 oz. but packs plenty of punch. Some would say it's the perfect pocket pistol.
I believe my asking price is fair. You are welcome to make me an offer, reasonable one, please. First ""I'll take it"" gets it.
I provide a detailed and bona fide sales receipt, so both of us are good on that. 
You must have a valid MN Driver's License and a Permit to Purchase or Permit to Carry card to buy it. No exceptions, please.

Just search Armslist, gunbroker, or buds and you can get more of an idea. 

It's a Rock River Arms LAR-8 (.308), in Mid-length (16"") barrel A4 configuration which has a flat top, fwd site base gas block with sling attachment, Hogue grip, 6 position stock. Comes with 3-20round mags and uses the FAL surplus mags which are inexpensive online and at gun shows. The 308 gives you the power and size to hunt large game and gives you a lot more range due to the projectile mass as compared to .223 while also having the ability to be a close combat semi-auto weapon. Also gives you way more muzzle velocity and several feet less bullet drop than the 7.62x39 past 250 yards.

The scope is a Leapers 1x4 combat scope with illuminated red/green reticle on a low profile base which has long eye relief. With a 1x4 you can crank it down and use it like a close combat red dot or bump it up to 4x to take 300 yard shots. The mounts are weaver quick release. The sling is a heavy padded combat sling that adjusts and has neoprene sleeves on the steel buckles so it doesnt make noise or scratch the finish. 200 rounds of federal, 40 rounds of winchester core lock. The nylon bag is padded with a sling to carry on your back with mag pouches in the front.

Model: SS Sparrow (NFA Item) 



Caliber/Gauge: .22 LR



Finish: Matte Black



Approx. Length:  5.08""



Condition: New in Box



Description: 


 The SS 22Sparrow is the first silencer in the world to offer the patent pending Multi Part Containment (MPC) technology, which allows the 22Sparrow to be easily disassembled for cleaning and maintenance after heavy use. 

Because the .22 LR round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time, it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue, .22 silencers must be disassembled for cleaning and regular maintenance. 

Until Silencerco introduced the 22Sparrow, the only .22 silencers that could be disassembled for cleaning required a cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds. However, often the components of those silencers would be fused together and unable to come apart. Competitor products on the market have baffles in their .22 silencers that must be removed by twisting the outer tube around the baffles and/or sliding the outer tube off of the baffles. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the outer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the outer tube, there is simply too much buildup of fouling and lead to remove the outer tube in that manner.

Silencerco solved this maintenance issue with MPC technology and made it possible for shooters to disassemble the 22Sparrow easily after heavy use without the need of tools. MPC technology revolutionized take-apart silencers by containing the lead and carbon debris to prevent the debris from reaching the outer tube. This innovative design is achieved by applying two tube halves before sliding the outer tube on the rest of the assembly. When disassembling, the outer tube can be easily removed, and the tube halves are free to pull away from the baffles without having to rotate or slide. Just pull off the tubes, clean the components, and reassemble.

This is a brand new .308 Saiga rifle, professionally converted and modified by Sierra Arms International into a Designated Marksman/Sniper configuration. This weapon was designed and built for medium to long range accuracy, and is very effective due to the longer chrome-lined, 21” medium barrel, the smooth action of the modified bolt and carrier, and the rigidity of the heavy duty scope mounting system. The special 24mmx1.5 threaded compensator/flash hider, as well as the ergonomic pistol grip and NATO-length butt stock also play an important factor in the effectiveness of this rifle. The medium barrel provides the rigidity needed for consistency without the added weight of a heavy barrel. NOTE: The pictured Leupold scope is not included in this sale.

Professional modifications are as follows: 
Barrel turned down to accept AK74 front sight block with monolithic 24mmx1.5 comp threads; Bolt and carrier modified and polished at contact points for smooth action; Fire control group replaced with G2 and moved forward; G2 fire control group machined and polished for supreme fit and function; Trigger guard and mag catch replaced with monolithic AKM unit; Pistol grip nut clearance machined into receiver and grip moved forward; Very thick, nearly corrosion proof, mil-spec parkerizing in very dark satin gray. 

Premium features are as follows:
21” chrome lined barrel; Black US-Made Intrafuse Tri-Rail foregrip for mounting additional accessories; Black rubberized ergonomic pistol grip; Black K-Var NATO length butt stock with tool holder; Indexed 24mm compensator/flash hider with engineered slots for increased control; Adjustable AK74 front sight block with muzzle brake detent; Shepherd’s hook fire control group retainer; Bolt hold-open latch; Adjustable flip up rear sight; Scope mount side rail.

Also includes the following:
Heavy Duty swivel, foldable, retractable, adjustable bi-pod;  Heavy Duty and rigid, Quick-Detach, side-mounted optic rail (2 rails; 1 side, 1 top); Original long-reach cleaning rod; Original Russian owner’s manual; Original oil can; Original tool/cleaning  kit, which will fit into K-Var stock; original Russian 8 round magazine (3 to 25 round US-made SGM  magazines are available from $38 to $49 each). NOTE: The pictured Leupold scope is not included in this sale.

If you're in the market for a sniper/marksman rifle, an AK47 variant, or an excellent hunting rifle, get yours from the country who created it: the authentic Russian Kalashnikov AK47. This rifle is far superior to cheaper versions that originated from other countries and were most likely rebuilt from a kit. This is a solid and affective rifle, and it will last for decades. This Saiga version is hard to find at this price, and is of limited supply."

Asking $110 cash FTF.

This particular holster is made for the Glock 26/27/33 pistol, right-handed, with the leather-lined kydex option. Comes with heavy-duty MTAC clips (http://www.comp-tac.com/product_info.php?products_id=81) for 1.5"" wide belts. Also fits Glock 19/23, muzzle will peek past the kydex, but covered on the leather side. In excellent condition, as shown in photos (carried for just a couple months, but ended up selling the pistol).

I have tried many of the other IWB holsters of this style (think CrossBreed ST, MTAC, etc). They are all good, but the Answer has the highest-quality hardware and build, least amount of surface area, and most careful attention to detail. The suede backing greatly improves comfort and the leather-lined kydex protects finish and quiets the draw. If you are looking for top-shelf, this is it.

Looking for a Glock shooter who can give this excellent holster a good home, this may be the last holster you ever buy! Comes with Allen wrench for adjusting ride height and cant.

This is my current carry holster (but for an M&P), so happy to answer any questions you may have.

Thanks for looking!

I'm selling this rifle almost new in box, having fired less than 40 rounds through it. It will include one 20 round magazine, a hard plastic carrying case and all other literature, cable lock, etc. that came with it when I bought it less than a year ago. It is a phenominal weapon, but I'm more comfortable with an AR; so I'm looking to sell this rifle to buy one. It shoots well: I've yielded two inch groups at a hundred yards, in the few rounds that I shot through it on a casual day.

Due to the assault weapons import ban, the PTR series of rifle is as close as Americans can get to owning an HK-91, without spending big bucks on one of the pre-ban HKs.

Two very affordable guns for sale/trade.

First is a HiPoint 45 acp Carbine.  about 100 rounds through it.  All paperwork and box included (even the bubble wrap).  I've added an extra magazine, ,a forgrip, and a tacticle light.  Perfect condition.

Second gun is a Ruger P95.  9mm...great condition...200? round through it.  Comes with 2 magazines, original baxc and paperwork.

This pair would be perfect for someone wanting to get a couple of nice guns at an economical price.  I've been fortunate enought to upgrade my collection, so I would like to trade these two for one higher priced firearm.  Or sell outright to someone wanting to start their own collection.

would sell both for $500.00 but I would NOT sell either one for $250 (come on...)

  if the post is active the guns are still available.  Would trade them individually, but would prefer to sell them togather (I'm not desperate).

Instructor Qualifications:

CCH Instructor since 2007
Full Time Police Officer
Police Firearms Instructor (Certified by the Kansas Law Enforcement Training Center, 92 hour course)
NRA Pistol Instructor
30 years Firearms Experience



I have real-world experience and teach from that perspective. I add to the basic curriculum to help better prepare students for the challenges of concealed carry and the
potential use of deadly force.

We cover CCH law, Use of Force, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Armed Response / Self Defense, Interaction with Law Enforcement and much more.

This is an excellent class taught by a knowledgeable instructor with a bit more than the AG CCH Instructor certification.

Many instructors base there classes on things learned in books and pseudo tactical as seen on TV
My instruction is based on proven and experienced technique and instruction

I have the opportunity to interact with many Concealed Carry Permit holders and have found that many times the information they received was inaccurate and sometimes dangerous.

I believe in Concealed Carry and the right to self defense and that is why I teach. If you are wanting to carry a firearm, just be sure you ask questions of your instructor; their philosophy and true credentials. It is easy to become concealed carry instructor, but it takes experience in armed conflict and full knowledge of the law to offer what is really required.

It is possible that your life, or in the case of a wrong decision your liberty, will depend on the quality and accuracy of the instruction you receive. No matter what class you take, check the credentials of the instructor. Please! For Your Sake.

The details:
- Price: $850 (the value of everything is as follows - gun: around $650-700, scope: $250-300 - ammo: $100+)
- The rifle is in great condition, very minor wear on the stocks forend. Has a little over 20 rounds through it and has been thoroughly cleaned after every time it's been shot (I'm crazy particular about my guns)
- The scope is great as well! Just what you'd expect from a Nikon....plus it's sighted in great. I shoot 2 inch groups at 125 easy, and I'm not the best shot.
- The ammo is all quality grade hunting rounds....there's atleast 70 rounds thatll be included if not a bit more.

This Arisaka type 38, has the mum ground down. I don't know who converted it, but they did an excellent job. I'm guessing that it was a professional gunsmith, probably during the 1970's.

The barrel is 16-1/2"" and the bore looks almost new. The stock is solid wood with a Monte Carlo cheek rest.

I have fired this rifle, and it shot fantastic. Very light recoil, and the groups were tight. It has open sights, but it can be drilled and tapped for a scope.

 The only reason that I want to sell or trade is because I'm left handed and I am uncomfortable shooting a bolt action."
