For sale today is a (dare I say it) ""mint-to-near mint"" condition SGW - Olympic Arms model CAR-AR AR-15 Carbine.
I believe very strongly that this has never been fired or even cycled. Just look at the pictures.
This rifle is in EXCELLENT condition, except for two TINY nicks on the stock release lever.

Just some of the very cool features of this rifle:

SGW pre ban ""Stop Sign"" lower (1989-1990 manufacturer date) http://www.olyarms.com/index.php?Itemid=26&id=13&option=com_content&task=view
Early aluminum collapsible stock body!
11.5"" barrel with permanently attached 4.5"" flash hider!
5.56/.223 cal.
Bayonet lug!
Smith Enterprises bolt carrier (high quality)!

Just a beautiful rifle.















I am the second owner. I purchased this from an older gentleman awhile back who had bought it brand new, before the assault weapons ban. He told me he had stuffed it in the corner of his safe and was surprised to discover it while moving. He also mentioned that he had never shot it (which I believe). After I bought it, I also put it in the corner of my safe and haven't touched it until I took the pictures today.

The upper and lower have a VERY tight fit, and the pins are also VERY tight. Best fitment on any AR I've owned (and I've had a lot).
No wear/line marks on the bolt carrier or even on the buffer.

What more can you ask for?? No I don't have the original box :(

Looking to put some money towards an exotic sports car purchase.

This is a really nice pistol, the pics do not do it justice.   I don't like the SA trigger, it's too light for me.   I prefer my G26.   This gun is VERY accurate, one of the most accurate I have fired.
I prefer to trade, but will sell outright for $800.

 After a couple of  hours on a website called coolgunsite.com, and a couple of other sites,  I have learned that this pistol was :  Made in 1943, has the proper High Standard barrel, Has the proper Keys grips, has the proper checkered mainspring housing, Has a magazine made by Little manufacturing  ( WWII supplier ), Is stamped with AA  for either Anniston Arsenal, or Agusta Arsenal.  This pistol was purchased from the government , via the NRA,  according to the older gentalman that sold it to me. He could  not find the paperwork.  It has most of the finish still on the gun. There are a lot of small pitts under the finish on the slide, and some on the frame as well. ( I assume that 's why it went through an arsenal ). The bore is shiny. There seems to be very little wear on the pistol, except at the sharp edges. I have not fired it, but it seems to function well.
 Please feel free to ask for more pictures or any questions. I believe this to be an honest example of a WWII 45.

System™ is the world’s first Adjustable-Zero™ fast-attach silencer mounting system. This revolutionary mounting system is designed to offer the operator the choice of instantly choosing between silenced or unsuppressed firing, while also providing the ability to adjust zero-shift. The MITER System Blackout™ flash eliminator provides reliable precision accuracy and the ability of installation or removal of the silencer in seconds in the harshest military environment. The over-the-barrel design has minimal affect of the weapon’s center of balance and maneuverability. The extreme durability of the SPR/M4 is maximized by CNC automated fusion welding of every high-temperature aerospace alloy component used in its construction- making 100% suppressed fire possible. The back-pressure lowering design of the silencer aids in shooter comfort, reduces weapon fouling, and minimizes cyclic rate increase. As a final step, tapered-bore EDM technology is utilized to ensure precise bore alignment resulting in enhanced accuracy and maximum performance. By removing approximately 97% of the muzzle report, the SPR/M4 eliminates the need for ear protection, preserves field communications, and masks the location of the shooter. Eliminating muzzle signature in combat saves lives.

	Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

Walther PPS is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses modified Browning type locking with tilting barrel. Frame of the gun is made from impact resistant polymer. Trigger is of double action only type, striker fired, with pre-cocked striker system, similar to QA system used in Walther P99 pistols. This system requires a manual recocking (by partial slide retraction) in the case of misfire. Gun is fitted with automated trigger safety and firing pin block; additional ""storage type"" safety is provided by removable backstrap of the grip; once backstrap is removed, the firing pin is automatically decocked and gun is blocked until the backstrap is reinstalled. This patented system is called QuickSafe by Walther. Sights are low profile, with rear sight adjustable for windage."

I've been asked about the configuration. I swapped the fixed stock on this with a folding one before BM was offering that configuration. Also note this is not ""Enhanced"" configuration. It's lighter and has a better length on the forearm that the enhanced and you get to choose your rail placement rather than having a full tri-rail forearm.

You can put a 6.8, 6.5 or 5.56 upper of any length on the lower, and you're still legal.

 I am sorry but my phone was drenched last night and it died, which is why I am not answering it.  And I got into a little trouble selling it for 650! I am not an expert and the family wants it to go for at least 800$ They wanted 900-1000 for it but I just want it gone, so $800. Thanks you for your patience and I will answer each and every email today. I am free all day today to show it. Please forgive if I forgot to answer however, as there are literally close to 60-70 people who have called/emailed/texted about it and it is a little overwhelming. -Andy
