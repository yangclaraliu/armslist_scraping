""Never before have handloaders had such fast, accurate, convenient and repeatable powder dispensing as they do now with the RCBS PowderMaster. Working as a team, the PowderMaster and Powder Pro utilize infrared light waves to communicate precise powder measurements, so dispensing is exact and effortless. No more timely scooping or trickling kernel by kernel. The PowderMaster delivers total accuracy at the simple push of a button. Just fill the hopper with powder and push calibrate. As the dispenser feeds to the scale, the Powder Pro Scale electronically communicates powder flow rate back to the dispenser allowing it to calibrate. Once the PowderMaster is calibrated all you have to do then is enter the desired charge weight and press dispense, the powder quickly flows automatically into the pan with accuracy of 0.1 grain."""

Someone asked the other day why is this gun hard to find? Because everyone that owns this model keeps it, due to it reliability and accuracy.

The BAR-10 was meant to compete in the .308 market against Armalite's AR-10 series rifles and Springfield Armory's M1A Rifle by offering a .308 rifle that could accept the relatively inexpensive metric and inch pattern FN FAL magazines.

**Due to funding and lack of demand this complete model was sold to Rock River Arms in the 2006 year range**  
Now that the demand has increased for this caliber- Bushmaster has came out with an OCR model. The OCR gun is a nice model but was not built to the standards of the original BAR10. 

A2- Bar10 308 - With factory upgraded Skeleton stock and Izzy Muzzle Brake

ONE OF THE MOST ACCURATE 308s ON THE MARKET

It is in perfect working order, with minimal signs of ever being used.

The Bushmaster .308 series was manufactured in late2004-2005

THIS IS NOT THE O.R.C.- This is the first edition that was built better than all the rest to beat the competition. was the only amidextrious 308 on the market! Perfect for Righties or Lefties!!! 
These guns sold for around $1,800 stock.

Heres what Bushmaster has to say about this gun:
The magazine controls are ingenious, both in how they have been adapted to the FAL magazine and in how their ergonomics offer the shooter improved control. The magazine catch is a spring-loaded latch that engages the locking lug on the FAL magazine’s upper rear face. The release is fully ambidextrous. When the release is pressed from either side, a lever retracts the latch and the magazine drops free.

Like the magazine catch, the bolt release is a departure. It consists of a one-piece bar that extends across the bottom of the rifle just forward of the trigger guard behind the magazine well. Pressing down on either side releases the bolt. The optional ambidextrous safety transforms the Bushmaster .308 into the only fully ambidextrous AR-type rifle available. Bushmaster also eliminated the sometimes inconvenient charging handle latch, replacing it with a hidden spring-loaded detent in the center of the charging handle that engages a recess in the upper receiver.

The upper and lower receivers are made of forged 7075-T6 aluminum. About half of the .308’s components interchange with those of .223-Rem. caliber rifles, but none are stressed, so reliability is unaffected. Two versions of the Bushmaster .308 are available—an A2 type with fixed carry handle and sights and an A3 variant with a flat top upper receiver and a three-rail gas block. Barrels are rifled with four lands and grooves in a 1:10"" right-hand twist.

The Bushmaster rifle came with an optional Ace Ltd. “ARFX” skeleton stock. This stock replaces the “A2” type fiberglass stock with one of hard anodized aluminum that is both lighter and stronger than the original. The stock has a closed-cell foam cover over the buffer tube. This provides a much improved cheek weld, and dampens vibration and noise. The stock comes with a 1/2"" thick recoil pad that has a “tacky” feel that helps hold the stock in position."

This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. I have much more invested in this weapon than my asking price. 

Drum is an extra $50 which is a steal because its new and cost me $100."

This rifle is the most accurate AR that I have ever shot. This is a DPMS AR-15 with an A2 stock and a 20 inch long, 1 inch diameter stainless bull barrel. This rifle has a free floating barrel and a free floating DPMS handguard, forward assist, and dust covers. The rifle also has a 6-24x44 scope that has not been sighted in. The scope has been mounted on a top rail scope mount. The rifle also has a bipod mounted. This rifle has a railed gas block and will come with two magazines as well. The stock has a few knicks and dings but nothing major. This came from shooting on a bench. The gun has been fired very little and hasn't been fired since I mounted the scope.

These kits are generally not available to the public and are very rare and hard to find to the average citizen.

For those who do not know what this is, it is a very popular, widely used training aid for Law Enforcement and Military units, giving them the ability to train with non-lethal, low energy ammunition in their actual weapon without using live ammo or blanks. It provides the actual feel of recoil and will cycle the slide as it would with actual ammo.

This drop-in barrel and firing pin accepts the Simunition FX paint marker ammunition, and the CQT polymer (plastic) bullet ammunition. The ammunition is hard to find as well but I will provide a source to the buyer, if they are not in law enforcement or military. 

THIS KIT WILL FIT THE GEN 1-3 GLOCK 17 ONLY! WILL NOT FIT GEN 4!

These kits sell for up to 450 depending on the type of weapon you need it for.

This is an excellent opportunity to own an excellent training aid that you could use in say your home, garage, basement, etc. depending on your situation and setup, without noise and damage to property or self.

This is a fairly old and well-used J.C. Higgins pump .410 shotgun.  It was my grandfather's shotgun and I really have no use for it.  I've shot it twice and the last time I shot it, after the third shell the firing pin stuck.  It retracted when I pumped it again, so I don't know if it was a one-time thing or not.  It's probably an easy fix.  I'm looking specifically for handguns larger than .25 caliber, but will entertain all reasonable offers.  Thanks."

Modifications:
-modified sear cage 
-modified sear
-modified hammer for a lighter trigger pull
-I'm not sure if they changed out the recoil spring but they did send me another recoil spring and guide with the gun.
-The gun uses its stock 18lb mainspring.
-They have reduced the trigger creep and the SA trigger pull should be 4-5lbs, DA should be 6.5lbs. (I was told that it would get even more lighter with use so they left it slightly heavier for the break in process, should become exactly 4lbs SA and 6lbs DA after)
-I am also not sure if they changed out the hammer, it didn't say on the work order but my gun came back with a parkerized one instead of a poly coated one.
-I know that most people would want the trigger at 3lbs but czcustom did not recommend that for a duty/carry gun so I asked for 4-5lbs.
I did not receive a work order online from czcustom though they said hey emailed it to me. I think they might have sent it to my spam box but I'll email them again for the work order. (I threw away the paper order since I thought I was keeping my gun)
The gun is practically new, I bought it two weeks before Christmas and sent it to czcustom to have it modified. My car was hit by a drunk driver so I have to sell my cz to save up for another car. I got the gun back the day before the accident too. I'll take this as a sign that I don't need another gun lol.
-The gun comes with all the original packaging
-two factory 18/19 round mags
-gun lock and key
-spare firing pin spring
-spare stock recoil spring and spring guide 
-extra polished silver trigger
-brand new fobus elite p01 paddle holster(yes the p01 holster fits the SP01).
The magazines fit 18rds, they will fit 19 after you break them in. ALSO, if you want a brand new 25rd box of 9mm 124gr +P Golden sabers just add ten dollars.
The price is firm and I really cant accept trades right now. Come and try out the trigger, its a night and day difference from stock form. Please provide your ID and CPL because I will need proof that you CAN own a firearm. I will be printing out a copy of the transfer form for you.

I'm selling it to fund another upper, because this configuration doesn't suit me that much.

It is painted with Krylon as a subdued, olive drab/khaki camo, however it can be easily cleaned off if you wish.

It's a 16"" non chromed heavy barrel, flat top receiver, with a YHM free floating quad rail. It has a YHM flip up BUIS and it has a mid length hand guard system. The muzzle brake is a YHM phantom compensator I believe, and it's perm attached per new york law. 

It's lightly used, maybe about 200 rounds fired through it so far so it's not even really broken in.

I don't have any pictures at the moment, but if you are interested in how it sounds I can send pictures right away. It comes complete with the bolt and bolt carrier group so you're all set to slap it on your lower and rock and roll.

I can do face to face in cash if you live within 100 miles of Saranac Lake new york, or I can ship it to you, but you'd have to pay me over paypal for that. 

Price is $600, or $520 without the BUIS."

MTM ammo cans are a great way to store bulk or boxed ammo. Its all plastic design is lighter in weight than the 50 caliber US Military Surplus Ammo Can. Transferring ammo to and from the range, just became a little easier! Ideal for ammo storage.

Molded out of rugged polypropylene plastic, these comfortably handled ammo cans will hold up to some pretty harsh treatment. Utilizing MTM's tongue and groove O-Ring seal system for a superior water-resistant seal, the 50 caliber can is designed to fit the same amount of bulk ammo storage as the original. A heavy-duty dual latching system makes for a better seal and less likely to open accidentally. Double padlock tabs along with molded-in stacking ridges, make these solid containers the perfect solution to so many storage needs.

Weight: 1.76 Pounds. The 50 cal military metal can weighes 5.30 pounds or 300% heavier empty.

Hi Power. Take a true classic to the range.
When it was introduced early in the 20th century, the Browning Hi Power 9mm pistol was a revelation. It offered the perfect balance of handling, size and firepower, with an impressive 13-round magazine capacity. Over the years, the Hi Power has aged gracefully and continues to have a loyal following among those “in the know.” Whether you are a novice or a seasoned shooter, you will appreciate the fine craftsmanship and function of these classic pistols, the sure heft of the machined steel frame and slide, and their natural pointability. Even with the double-column magazine, the grip is narrow to neatly accommodate nearly every hand size, and the single-action trigger provides a smooth, consistent pull. As reliable, accurate and easy to shoot as ever, every true firearm enthusiast should have a Hi Power in their collection. 
Sights
Hi Power pistols are available with fixed, low-profile three-dot sights. The Hi Power Standard is available with optional low-profile target sights that are adjustable for windage and elevation. 
Safety
A large, ambidextrous manual thumb safety is conveniently located just above the grip. 
Magazine Capacity
Double-stack magazine design. 13-round magazine standard in 9mm. 10-round magazine in 40 S&W. 10-round models in 9mm available where required by law. Follow state and local laws regarding magazine capacity when ordering. 
Trigger
The light single-action trigger breaks clean and crisp. This is the system preferred by professionals around the world. 
Frame and Slide
Forged from solid steel, yet still lightweight. The heft of the Hi Power keeps recoil light and manageable for accurate firing, even at a rapid rate. The balance in the hand is impeccable."

I just replaced the top cover with a brand new one, eliminating the previous blemishes.  This is the ""Right Arm of the Free World,"" and awesome to shoot.

It is the pistol with 6 Glock factory 13 round high cap magazines with all the paperwork/extras that come with the new ones. 
I have added Meprolight night sights, a 3.5 Ghost Ultimate trigger, Wolf Stainless steel guide rod, grip plug, and an extended magazine release. The factory items are also included if you wish to return the pistol to stock.

The receiver is steel, and stamped as a 'centurion 2000'. Apparently these were built by century arms using a Hesse receiver. You'll see the same model going for $800-900 on recent online auctions. That's without the extras noted below.

To help you along in your cost assessment; below is rough estimate of current value of the rifle and accessories:
rifle w/ clone reciever all other parts original HK with original black furniture and wide forearm - ~$700 - 800
HK steel bipod - ~$60 -75
magpul prs buttstock (w/ heavy buffer spring) - ~$200 - 250
Leapers forearm w/ modern railing - ~$70-75
B square claw scope mount - ~$50
10 HK steel and aluminum mags - ~$3-7 each
set of green HK furniture with the jungle slim forearm and buttstock with buffer spring - ~$20
HK battle sling - $30
I'll even throw in the pictured scope made by Hawke.

There are some areas of normal wear on the finish hardly noticable. There is a more noticable scratch on the top of the receiver where the claw mount attaches that when the mount is on, you cannot see it.

Price is $900 firm."
