It fires the 7.62x54R round, a plentiful, cheap, and powerful round.  For the short time I have had it, it functioned beautifully, and performed great, and the only reason for selling is to fund future projects.

Unique to this specimen is a newly purchased magazine to increase reliability (the stock mags are often prone to weak springs), and a much improved optic over the standard optic mounted on these.  It is still Soviet bloc issue (this one is Belarusian, not an imitation US-made clone), and retains the reticle of the original, but is 8x42, illuminates red, and with greater zoom and optical clarity than the smaller 4 power usually found on them.  These scopes alone are very difficult to find for less than $200.

Will also consider trades/partial trades, especially (but not limited to): 5.45mm AK's, higher end pistols (to include S&W, Springfield, etc.), AR's, M1A's, higher end optics (Aimpoint, Eotech, Trijicon, etc.), and would also consider using this rifle as a partial trade for something you may have that would be of higher value than this rifle.

For the short time I have had it, it functioned beautifully, and performed great, and the only reason for selling is to fund future projects.

Unique to this specimen is a newly purchased magazine to increase reliability (the stock mags are often prone to weak springs), and a much improved optic over the standard optic mounted on these.  It is still Soviet bloc issue (this one is Belarusian, not an imitation US-made clone), and retains the reticle of the original, but is 8x42, illuminates red, and with greater zoom and optical clarity than the smaller 4 power usually found on them.  These scopes alone are very difficult to find for less than $200.

Triangular fluted barrell with integrated muzzlebrake.
Trigger is adjustable, and I have it lightened somewhat - don't have a way to measure it though.  The rifle is more accurate than I am.  I'm not any sort of pro and I can put 3 in a 1"" square at 100 yards.  I have about 150 rounds through it.  Feel free to email me if I've left something out.  I can't tell if the muzzlebrake does anything, but it is good for protecting the barrel crown since the crown is recessed at least an inch from the end of the barrel.  Keep that in mind if you try to boresight one of these.

Price includes the following, but I'll drop $150 if you don't want the scope:
Nikon ProStaff 3-9x40 scope with windowed flip-up covers.

Cross reference sheet shows this is a Marlin 101, does have the micro-groove barrel. Stock was crappy when I got it, so I refinished it with about 5 coats of tru-oil, very smooth and looks good now.

More History/Info
-------------------
Caliber: 7.5x54 mm
Overall length: 1020 mm
Barrel length: 575 mm
Weight: 3.7 kg empty
Magazine capacity: 5 rounds

French army was among the first to adopt the smokeless rifle ammunition in the form of 8mm Lebel cartridge in 1886. By the early 1920s this rimmed cartridge became obsolete, so French began to develop a more modern, rimless cartridge, more suitable for proposed lightweight machine guns. By the 1924 French army had the new 7.5mm cartridge, but this proved to be unsuccessful, and by the 1929 the updated version of the 7.5mm ammunition has been adopted as 7.5mm Cartouche Mle.1929C (7.5x54mm). By the same time, French also developed a lightweight machinegun, the MAC 1929. Initially, French tried to convert earlier 8mm Berthier rifles for new ammunition, but it was apparent that the new rifle is desirable for French infantry. In 1936 French military officially adopted the MAS Mle.1936 (MAS-36) bolt-action rifle, developed by the Manufacture D'Armes de Saint-Etienne. Later on, French forces adopted the modified paratrooper's version, known as MAS-36 CR 39. This version differed from basic rifle by the aluminum butt stock, which can be folded down and under the forend. This rifle served with French armed forces until the semi-automatic MAS-49 and MAS-49/56 replaced it in service during 1950s and 1960s. The MAS-36 rifle was in production up until the mid-1950s. The MAS-36 action also served as a platform for FR F-1 and FR F-2 sniper rifles, which are still in service with French Armed forces. Since 1951, some of MAS-36 rifles were converted or made into MAS-36/51 pattern, by adding the permanently attached grenade launchers and rifle grenade sights. Grenade launcher was attached to the muzzle of the gun, and was used to launch rifle grenades using special blank ammunition. Folding grenade sight was attached to the left side of the front sight base.

MAS-36 is a manually operated, magazine fed, rotating bolt action rifle. The rotating bolt has two opposing lugs, located at the rear of the bolt body. The bolt locks into receiver walls, the bolt handle is located at the rear of the bolt, and is bent forward for more comfortable operation. The square-shaped receiver is machined from steel, and contained integral magazine. Magazine is loaded using charging clips or single rounds, with clip guides machined into the receiver bridge. The wooden stock is made from two parts (butt stock and forend), both connected to the uncovered receiver. The spike-shaped bayonet is stored in the tube below the barrel in reversed position, when not in use. Diopter rear sight is located at the rear of the receiver, and marked from 100 to 1 200 meters in 100 meters increments. Probably the most noticeable feature of the MAS-36 is the lack of any manual safety - rifle was supposed to be carried with empty magazine, and loaded only before the actual combat.

It fires the 7.62x54R round, a plentiful, cheap, and powerful round. For the short time I have had it, it functioned beautifully, and performed great, and the only reason for selling is to fund future projects.

Unique to this specimen is a newly purchased magazine to increase reliability (the stock mags are often prone to weak springs), and a much improved optic (POSP 8x42) over the standard optic mounted on these. It is still Soviet bloc issue (this one is Belarusian, not an imitation US-made clone), and retains the reticle of the original, but is 8x42, illuminates red, and with greater zoom and optical clarity than the smaller 4 power usually found on them. These scopes alone are very difficult to find for less than $200.

Will also consider trades/partial trades, especially (but not limited to): 5.45mm AK's, higher end pistols (to include S&W, Springfield, etc.), AR's, M1A's, higher end optics (Aimpoint, Eotech, Trijicon, etc.), and would also consider using this rifle as a partial trade for something you may have that would be of higher value than this rifle. Looking to sell for approximately 1000.  Don't hesitate to e-mail, and have a good day."

It has been shot just enough to be properly broken in, less than 50 rounds put down the pipe. The only reason it is being sold is that I switched to using open match sights, and a longer barrel was chosen to increase sight radius. Perfect for your target-.22 build.

She was looking for a comfortable IWB holster that would fit and help her print less.  Being smaller in stature and figure we ended up taking up a little crusade to make an ideal IWB for her.  We started first at the ranges and CCW instructors asking what they saw wrong with their current holsters and how to fix some of the issues.  We took it to the young, we took it to the old and we created the Talon.  

This holster is lighter weight than what we typically produce.  It is a very nice and quality leather produced in the state of Missouri, and after several testings we found that the lightweight leather we decided upon holds up just as well as the heavier leather we typically use.  This is great for our customers since our quality guarantee, and warranty will not be affected by the change in leather for the TALON.  

Crafting it out became a challenge, something we truly enjoy at NightWing.  We were determined to have the perfect holster for her upon her return.  

The holster speaks for itself, as does all of our work.  She was very pleased with the holster design and comfort, and has already ordered another for her XDSC. The one below is of her everyday carry a Taurus Millenium Pro.

Last pic is of her in a rather fitting and shorter sweater she showed up in, with zero print.
