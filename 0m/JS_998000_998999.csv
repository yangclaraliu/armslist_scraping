Generation 3

The pilkington kite is known in the British army as CWS common weapon sight. In the USA they are made under the name by Raptor. SA80 rail mount on it. I do have a weaver adapter that slides into the sa80 rail so it can be mounted on a weaver or picatinny rail. You can purchase the newer rail mount adapter, that will replace the sa80 for $200-$300. The night sight is amazing at night and is in great working order. The parallax is really smooth when your adjusting the focus. I believe these are set up for 100m-300m... It takes 2 AA batteries.

In service in over 50 countries.
Pilkington's were made in the early 90's and bought out by qioptiq which has been bought out by some other company I think Thales .

Anyways here's some info from qioptiq
http://www.qioptiq.com/download/Qioptiq_KITE_Nov2011.pdf

It has a illuminated reticle kind of like a upside down chevron sight with a line on the top and a dot in the center that is used for day and night time use.

Used they sell for $4000-$4300 if you can find one.

It is Chambered in 7.62X39MM and i had it shooting pretty good the last time I went. It has an extremely low round count at 200 and like any good AK I did do some rapid fire and had 0 jams.

The Mods:

I did do some extensive modding to just the look and feel.

Buttstock: Removed the Saiga plastic buttstock, and put in a nice adjustable buttstock.

Front: I removed the standard barrel piece and replaced it with a fitted quadra rail, it's clean it gives it plenty of room to modify with accessories. I currently have a foregrip and a adjustable bi-pod up front.

Scope Mount: I added a quick release scope mount it has picittany mounted rings and a squarefield 6X mounted.

I would like to sell it and cash will take priority over trades.

I will only sell in Washington state."

The gougers don't like my message and almost instantly flag it off. For lack of a forum or otherwise to post, this is the only option so I'll repost again. It is not my intention or wish to misuse the listing service, but you need to hear this message. I also urge anyone sympathetic with our grievance to join me in re-posting this message a couple times a day, the more of us that spread the message, the more who will see it and think. I pains me to think some less informed but well intentioned people may get ripped off by buying from these gougers at the worst possible time. Thank God that windows will be a short one.

Listen up:

Folks, there will be NO ban on ""assault"" rifles and HIGHLY unlikely there will be any magazine bans either. Haven't you noticed even the most hard-core leftist democrats have already taken a step back? They want nothing to do with this. There was a very serious house cleaning in politics when they did this under Clinton and they know better than to every do it again. 
By now you have all heard what is in the ban proposal. It's a long and rediculous list that everyone knows is a joke. No fool would propose such a bill if they didn't fully expect it to be laughed out of congress... the bill is just to appease the pansy liberal voters... in fact, it's practically dead already.
The Illinios magazine ban fell dead in congress without even going to a vote. If a leftist cesspool like Illinois can't even pass it, what do you think is going to happen at the federal level with this current proposal? Federal democrats are already starting to redirect everyone's attention to immigration reform because the gun-grab battle is already lost and they know it. They were trying to run all those news stories about how 90% of all Americans support background checks trying to make you believe it and it didn't work becasue there are 10 of us to every 1 of them. Politicians may be bastards, but they aren't stupid. One thing they know very well is how to stay in office and every single one of them knows a vote for a gun ban will end their career.

The gun culture is suffering a setback right now brought about by the same people who buy up the newest toy every year at Christmas and try to gouge you on Craigslist so your kid can have one. This practice is utterly disgusting and is seriously damaging the sport. 
STOP buying this stuff from them at these outrageous prices. Seriously... 1500 bucks for a Bushmaster? 1.00+ per round for .223?
All they are doing is causing a short-term shortage and the end is near for them, now they are asking 3 grand for a simple AR-15. Don't fall for it! It's over and I hope none of you paid these stupid prices. This ban proposal will mostl likely be officially dead before March and by mid-summer, there will be a surplus of firearms on the market at very reasonable prices. As soon as the ban proposal fails, no one will even want these rifles anymore and you'll be buying them for discounted prices. These jokers who are trying to rip you off know it's over and are getting desperate. The more intelligent ones are already starting to drop their asking price while the rest hang on for dear life knowing they are going to be stuck with a gun they don't even want. HAHAHA ! Cross your fingers and hope they end up losing money when this is over.

So, just relax, calm down and wait a few months... let the hoarders and ripoff artists get stuck with their scheme to rob you. Most of them don't even realize that a Bushmaster is a bottom of the barrel AR platform... they think it's gold plated... they went and bought one at the gun shop thinking they could flip it and double their money.
I assure you, by this time next year, you will be buying 30 round AK and AR mags for 4 bucks again at the gun shows and semi-auto rifles will be plentiful and reasonable priced... IF you can control yourselves. Stop feeding these animals and they will go away... eventually. DO NOT pay double and triple for these weapons, ammunition and magazines. Believe me, I'm tempted to sell my own at these stupid prices but I refuse to participate in this orgy of idiocy. Keep calm and wait them out. Let them eat the ammo they are hoarding when they get hungry... then maybe those of us who are serious and love our sport will be rid of the baseball card traders trying to get rich off of you overnight. 
Let's all stand together and fight this plague in unison.
Peace"

This is a well cared for pistol. I've gone so far as to polish some of the moving surfaces for a smoother action and less friction when feeding/firing. This pistol has never failed me.

If you're looking for a 26 this could be your only chance for awhile. Glock is at least 10 months behind in back orders due to current events and the re-elected Marxist.

Colt's Manufacturing Company re-introduces the renowned Sporter line of firearms with the SP6920 carbine with all the features you would want on a modern rifle. Modeled after the Colt M4 carbine supplied to the U.S. Government, the SP6920 has a 4 position collapsible buttstock, 16"" chrome lined barrel and a flat top upper receiver with a removable carry handle. This rifle is California approved and comes with a Bullet Button and 9 round magazine.
As hard as the M4's are to find, I suspect it will be very difficult for people to fine one of these in California to transfer into their name before the gun laws change so that they may have it grandfathered."

At the time, this was Para Ordnance's hi-cap race gun. The sites were designed for competition shooting - an all-black rear blade site. I had a company in Texas add three white tritium lines to the rear site to outline the opening and painted a dot on the front so I could hit something. Really didn't use it that much.

The engine needs carb work but will start. These engines are very much in demand...engine alone is worth 1k with gearbox, the prop and instruments worth 500, and the trike frame is worth 2k.  The wing alone is worth 3k (it is new) and the total package with a days worth of tinkering and a few hundred in parts is worth 5-6k used (a new soaring trike like this would run 15k easy.  This is the smallest and lightest quality aircraft around.  You don't need any lic as it is a legal ultralight.  It is designed to use as a motorglider, which means on a summer day, you can fly it with the engine turned off.  The whole thing will fold up and fit in a minivan and the wing goes on the roof rack.  you do need training if you do not want to die, as this is a real aircraft and not a toy.  The wing is a real hang glider and is state of the art, and totally fine flying without the trike if you want to use just the wing sometimes.     This would be a quick way to turn 3 grand worth of guns into  5k cash if you are good at carb work."

The rifle still has all of the eagles which is farely rare as most of the eagles on other mausers have been scratched off. The rifle doesn't have matching parts but it is  agreat shooter. It is very accurate. The back sight was taken off and replaced with a new one. There is a crack in the back of the stock but it doesn't affect the rifle. The action is smooth and the barrel is clean.

It was built from a never fired de-milled parts kit along with Radom built Polish parts on an NDS-7 RPK receiver that has the ejector professionally extended. (This was built before the straight back Y556 receivers) The original M95 was modified to accept the hard mounted Polish Beryl top rail by adding a very rare Beryl three rivet rear trunnion along with the front sight block mounting points being professionally machined by a master machinist. The barrel is hammer forged, chrome lined, and the original Yugoslavian barrel. Twist is 1 in 7, the gas system is adjustable, and the bayonet lug is there. The M95 has tritium night sights that still glow. The receiver and trigger guard are still unfinished and the rest of the rifle has the original blued finish. This rifle is 922r compliant with a high quality US made RSA adjustable two stage fire control group, US receiver, US made polymer hand guards, and US made flash hider. It comes with one Yugoslavian 30 round magazine, NOS 4-mag pouch, Yugo sling, and very good condition Yugo bayonet. I have about 500 flawless rounds through the rifle and it is very accurate"

PRODUCT DETAILS A model developed after the M4 pattern rifle, the PWS MK114 Rifle has quickly become the crowd favorite for those wanting a compact package without the NFA paperwork associated with shorter barrels. The MK114 retains lethal capability out to 500 meters with varying types of ammunition and boasts a permanently attached FSC556. Utilizing the proven system originally designed for the MK107, the MK114 uses a mid length gas piston system. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 15” handguard and free-floated barrel. The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2” sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail. Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER™ charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The rifle is rounded out with industry leading features such as Magpul® MOE® grip, MOE® stock, and MBUS2® sights. Available as a complete rifle or as a complete upper receiver.
