The stainless gas tube is covered by a ventilated heat shield that is very effective in protecting the hand from the hot tube during rapid firing of the weapon. The type 97 wears the very comfortable Hogue hard rubber pistol grip. The controls on the weapon will be very familiar to anyone who has used an AR-15 or M16 rifle.

READ THIS!!!! TRUE STORY, IT JUST HAPPENED!

On Sunday December 17, 2012, 2 days after the CT shooting, a man went to a restaurant in San Antonio to kill his X-girlfriend. After he shot her, most of the people in the restaurant fled next door to a theater. The gunman followed them and entered the theater so he could shoot more people. He started shooting and people in the theater started running and screaming. It’s like the Aurora, CO theater story plus a restaurant!

Now aren’t you wondering why this isn’t a lead story in the national media along with the school shooting?

There was an off duty county deputy at the theater. SHE pulled out her gun and shot the man 4 times before he had a chance to kill anyone. So since this story makes the point that the best thing to stop a bad person with a gun is a good person with a gun, the media is treating it like it never happened.

Only the local media covered it. The city is giving her a medal next week"

We are selling our FN SCAR 16S 5.56 Assault Rifle, it is also know as Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR). I absolutely love this gun and is by far my favorite out of all the firearms I have ever owned!!! We are only selling it because it is very difficult for us to export it to Honduras where we will eventually be moving. The SCAR by itself is already a mean and very extremely capable machine, but I added some very nice accessories to it anyway. I will adhere to all local and state laws in this sale. I will do my best to describe everything, but if I miss something don't hesitate to ask. I'm selling the SCAR with everything listed in the description and I am NOT interested in selling the SCAR without the accessories or taking any trades. I have only shot around 200 rounds through the SCAR and it stays in a gun safe or in a Pelican case. This is a adult owned and fired gun that has been very well taken care of.

This is high quality brass not steel ammo and is re-loadable so if there is a ban you can reload the brass!!! This is much better ammo than the majority of junk others are posting. They are trying to get 5 to 10 ten times what their average ammo is worth. This is barely marked up for high quality ammo.

Message me number or email and lets meet San Antonio face to face. Ammo is scarce for AR15s right now. Can't find it anywhere online and this is good stuff.

Features and Benefits

5.56 NATO caliber
55 grains
150-round box


This is high quality brass ammo for your AR-15. Don't spend a ton of money on an AR then skimp and get crap on the ammo. This is also re-loadable unlike all the steel crap most are selling and if there really is a ban this brass will be very valuable for reloading.

The following is the description from the site I purchased the gun from back in early summer:

Colt SP6920 AR15 Carbine. The Gold Standard of AR15's 

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. 

Colt's M4 Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. - Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components - Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm) - Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire - 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations - Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications - Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures - Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud - Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance - Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories - M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification - Cleaning kit, sling, and 1 magazine are standard. - Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation - High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness. 

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in in length and weighs only 5.65 lb - ideal for tactical use."

Product Features
18-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor
An APS-C sized, 18-megapixel CMOS sensor captures images that are packed with detail and clarity. Such high-resolution allows large print sizes and the flexibility to crop pictures for alternative compositions.
ISO 100-6400 sensitivity
An ISO range of 100-6400, extendable to ISO 12,800, enables high-quality hand-held shooting in low-light conditions, without the need for flash.
14-bit image processing
At the heart of the Canon EOS 600D is a 14-bit DIGIC 4 image processor that provides exceptional color reproduction, smooth tonal gradation and tight control over noise.
Scene intelligent auto mode
Scene intelligent auto analyzes each scene in detail and picks the right camera settings each and every time, leaving you free to concentrate on what's important - your photography.

Full-HD EOS movie
Shoot Full-HD video with manual control over frame rate, exposure and sound.

9-point wide-area AF and iFCL metering
Nine AF points, including one central cross-type sensor, spread out across the frame for swift, accurate focusing, even with off-center subjects. 63-zone iFCL metering ensures accurate exposures time after time.

Basic+ technology allows photographers to customize basic auto settings according to lighting conditions or ambience.
Creative filter effects
Creative filter effects can be applied to Raw and JPEG files post capture, including toy camera, soft focus, miniature, grainy black and white and fish eye simulations.
Built-in wireless flash control

Great for civil war re-enactor's or those who just want to make some noise! Up for auction is this 3/4 scale, 1841 6 pounder cannon. The cannon barrel is cast, believe to be made by Dixie Gun Works??

The wheels and axle is a original buckboard axle from the early days, cut and spliced by the original owner to fit the size of the piece. This carriage very closely duplicates an original carriage, and was serviced and painted by a local military historian/ gunsmith who has restored several pieces of military weaponry for the National Guard Museum at Camp Dodge in Johnston, IA. This cannon includes the swab, sponge, worm hook, and a operating guide. Sorry, there is no shipping on this item, and it must be picked up at it's current location in Van Meter, IA 50261."

Greetings,

Due to the recent events at Sandy Hook elementary school we now face renewed threats to our Constitutional rights. While I understand how painful the loss must be for those touched by this tragedy, blaming firearms or their owners and punishing them is not the answer to the challenges we face as a nation.

We already have laws that were violated by a man who was likely psychotic and heavily medicated. This man was stopped by the mandatory background check from purchasing firearms. He then decided to murder his mother and take her legally owned firearms to commit this tragedy.

If your true goal is to protect our children, then enact legislation that will do that. Banning firearms that are rarely used in crime (less than 1% of the time) is not going to stop such tragedies, that was proven in 1999 when the Columbine shooting took place under the 1994 ban. Do something meaningful, please. Make committing the insane easier. Put armed security guards in our schools. But do not strip us of our rights and property by passing additional anti-gun laws that have historically had no positive effect on crime in our nation or others.

Thank you.

""Firearms stand next in importance to the constitution itself. They are the American people's liberty teeth and keystone under independence … from the hour the Pilgrims landed to the present day, events, occurences and tendencies prove that to ensure peace security and happiness, the rifle and pistol are equally indispensable … the very atmosphere of firearms anywhere restrains evil interference — they deserve a place of honor with all that's good.""-George Washington"

This gun is very new with only 40 rounds through it and has lots of upgrades.
Stark Equipment grip with storage and quick release strap connection. Once you use this grip you will stop buying all the others. It has the Magpul flip up fixed rear site & Magpul Handguard that you can add pickatinny rails to on multiple sides. I have installed the 11 slot rail length to the bottom. This gives you space for a forward grip, light, laser or bipod.
You could add an Eotech or scope to the top rail if desired. It has the Magpul B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) This is another one of those things that once you use you will want on all of your AR's.

Includes: (1) original metal (30) round magazine, owners manual and original box.

The internals of the gun are in great condition, including the bore and barrel. This gun has been shot VERY little. 
It has a little rust on the receiver from getting put up in the safe without a wipedown for a few years. This could be easily removed and refinished but I decided to leave the gun in its original, albeit minor flawed condition.

One 20 round magazine included as well as the angled forearm grip, vertical grip and sling swivel and tactical light pictured.

Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open.

946,http://www.armslist.com/posts/775946,For Sale:  SKS wood sporterized stock for Yugo,"all, Colorado, United States",$ 50,"Listed On: Monday, December 31, 2012",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This a a Yugo stock that I sporterized myself when stripping down a Yugo SKS to use for hunting, and took me many hours with a belt sander and hand sanding to shape. I realize I will never get that time out of it, but I have no use for it now and hopefully it can find a home on an SKS again. On a Yugo that I demilled the bayonet mount from, the rifle had a very nice traditional hunting profile. 

It has a very nice tiger stripe pattern to the grain that appeared after sanding off the old finished. I refinished it with a one step sealer and finish that gave it a nice color and set off the tiger stripe patter.

I went a bit small on the grip area, which would make it perfect for youth or woman's hand, although it wasn't too small for a man to use either. 

I do not know if it will fit other types of SKS
