It has a Mauser 98 action, bull barrel and a very nice walnut stock (I believe thats the type of wood). It's pretty heavy (about 14lbs) as it is intended to be a target gun.  But I put a bipod on it to hunt with it.  It also has an 8-32x50 Barska scope.

It shoots extremely tight groups with factory loads, but the person I bought it from was a reloader and he could get the groups even tighter.  Great for a target gun or a varmit gun.  There is almost no recoil because of the weight of the gun so it would be great for a youngster to learn with.

If I don't find a good TOKAREV trade Iwon't lose any sleep this gun is really cool being that its a GEN 1, I will just keep it!  :)                                                  Thank you and God Bless .

Chambered for the .22 LR and .22 Magnum cartridges the Rough Rider is manufactured using state of the art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em."

This particular rifle has been re-chambered in 7.62 x 39 (AK Round). The only downsides are that the rifle needs to be chambered with enough force otherwise the round will not catch on the extractor and will lead to a misfire (because the pin will miss the primer) and it will not securely hold more than one or two rounds in the magazine due to the small size of this round (Which isn't a big deal IMO as it is a bolt action and I only loaded one round at a time anyway). Otherwise, the conversion is really nice as you can shoot cheap and commonly found 7.62x39. This conversion was not done by me, but the previous owner's father who passed last year. 

The rifle has a very nice Walnut Stock with a great finish, a very crisp trigger, stainless steel bolt and magazine follower, a white dotted front sight with hood, an aftermarket William's Rear Sight adjustable for Wind. and Elev. and the rifle comes with a brown and tan leather case which has been with the rifle for as long as I can remember. All I can say is that it is a fun shooter, holds a lot of character and of course uses the tried and true German Mauser action with the complete 3 point safety."

It comes with 3 magazines, the CMMG gray mag, and 2 Black Dog Machine 26 round mags, one black and one smoke black that allows you to see how many rounds are left in the magazine.

IMPROVED OUTER TACTICAL VEST 
IOTV GENERATION 2, BODY ARMOR
COMPLETE WITH SOFT ARMOR & PLATES
DATED 12/2009, UNWORN, MEDIUM

This is the first of the Gen 2 Vests I have seen and these are few and far between. It shows No signs of ever being worn. 

Vest Includes:
•	Vest with all soft armor inserts and quick release system, 12/2009, Medium fits Chest 37-41
•	Front and Back Collars, 12/2009
•	Groin Protector and Lower Back Protector with inserts, 12/2009
•	Internal Waistband
•	Right and Left “Wing” assemblies, (MOLLE Waistband/Cumberbund)
•	Side Plate Carriers/Pouches
•	DAPS with inserts, Both dated 2007

If you held the Generation I & II vests side by side, it might be hard to tell the difference. For operators in the field, however, even a set of subtle changes can have far-reaching effects. 
The Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) incorporates new utility features and design enhancements which provide lightweight comfort and maximum protection. All of IOTV’s improvements result in a fully integrated vest that not only offers the most advanced protection available but greater maneuverability for mission effectiveness.

•	One change set involved expanding vertical adjustment of the side plate carriers, and allowing horizontal changes. This allows IOTV to properly fit a wider variety of soldier sizes, including women.
•	The Gen II design converted back to Cordura for mesh, because the previous material was so “aggressive” that it was damaging the uniform underneath. 
•	Streamlining the quick release cable handle to reduce pinch-points or friction, so it can weigh less and work better.
•	More than three pounds lighter than OTV
•	Lower back extender protects the lower spine region and increases the vest’s coverage by 52 square inches
•	Internal waistband enhances mobility by distributing the weight from the shoulders to the waist and helps stabilize the load
•	The other major Generation II change involves D-Ring attachments on the front, to make additional gear easier including a load-bearing system (Tactical Assault Panel, Not Included) that goes beyond MOLLE velcro’s holding capacity

PLATES INCLUDED
Ceradyne ESAPI, Type VI Level IV Plates
•	ESAPI Type VI Level IV Plates
•	Like New, Excellent Condition
•	Medium Size: Dimensions: 9.50""x12.5"" x.800” (241 x 318 x 20 mm) Weight: 6.27 lbs (2.41 kg)
•	Type IV
•	Certified 2009

My situation has changed … So the whole package needs to go …
I was asking $1200 for the set before but the transmission in my truck decided we needed to part ways (not in a gentle manner either) Hence I am selling this, and a few other items so I can pay the bill. Sorry I already have my mechanic working on it so I need to round up cash. I’m usually open for trades but not this time.
I am asking $850 for the complete set. That includes the vest with all inserts and attachments. And the front and rear plates
First Person that emails me they want it …and its theirs. Look at others and check me. $850 is a great price but I am willing to budge a bit.
Would consider Firearms Trades but be aware I am going to turn around and sell them (or if its neater than what I have I may keep yours and sell mine)
Right now Cash is king but trades considered. 
I am not interested in Labor trades or work on my truck as its already at the mechanics shop.

These are guaranteed to fire correctly. This is a box of 100 bullets. Each box contains 10 plastic plugged tubes with 10 cartridges in each tubes for a total of 100 rounds. These bullets have no cartridge case as well as no primer to cause rust and corrosion. They have a velocity of 1150 FPS. They are intended to be shot with a Daisy VL rifle. 


The V-L bullet consists merely of a cylindrical plug of solid propellant attached to the rear of a slug or missile. When the trigger of a V-L rifle is pulled, a powerful spring drives a cocked plunger into a cylinder, compressing and heating the trapped air to about 2,000° F. Escaping into the firing chamber through a valve, a jet of heated air strikes and ignites the propellant, which pushes the missile through the barrel"

The Hobart 500525 Handler 187 MIG Welder is a compact yet powerful welder, offering 185 Amps of power. The Handler 187 is able to weld 24 Gauge to 5/16-Inch steel as well as welding in a variety of materials including mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminum.
Features:

Seven voltage settings and infinite wire feed control enable fine tuning for the smoothest arc with less spatter, resulting in a better bead appearance and less cleanup 
Welds 24 gauge up to 5/16-Inch steel 
Proven built-in wire feeder with quick-release drive roll lever for easy usage 
Built-in contactor for easy use is also an excellent safety feature which makes wire electrically ""cold"" when not welding 
Dual groove drive rolls make it easy to switch between .023/.025-Inch (0.6 mm) and .030 to .035-Inch (0.8 - 0.9 mm) wire

""Operation: Fast and Furious? Shipping 30,000 guns in to Mexico by the ATF, FBI and DEA is a act of staged terror in Mexico and the U S.

But what could be the reasons for Washington initiating such a program in the first place? Why would the Obama administration actively send 30,000 sniper rifles, assault weapons and firearms into Mexico even while claiming to follow an anti-gun stance back in the USA?

To answer that question, you need to understand P.R.S — Problem, Reaction, Solution. It is the “playbook” that governments use to get what they want, which usually involves: 1) Disarming their populations, 2) Taking away all their rights and freedoms, and then 3) Ruling over their people as tyrants with complete power.

Precisely such an effort is now underway in the United States, led by the Obama administration which has repeatedly demonstrated itself to be an enemy of the U.S. Constitution and its Bill of Rights.""

778,http://www.armslist.com/posts/159778,For Sale/Trade:  1989 Ford Bronco II (Eddie Bauer),"Westerville, Columbus, Ohio",$ 850,"Listed On: Saturday, July 9, 2011",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I will be relocating very soon, so this needs to go. Owned by my grandfather since the mid-1990s, until his passing. Owned by me since last summer. This is one of the good Bronco II's, and there are fewer and fewer good ones hanging around. Way too nice to junk, even with its problems (see below). Read the whole ad before responding, please.

1989 Ford Bronco II (Eddie Bauer)
 Mileage: 152k
 Engine: Fuel Injected 2.9L V6
 Tires: Kelley Safari (lots of tread)

THE GOOD:
 -Strong, smooth engine that starts up like a champ.
 -Push button 4x4 works (sometimes have to push the button a couple of times). Old-school, constant power to all four wheels. Makes for fun snow driving.
 -Nicest interior you'll find in a Bronco II. Just a little wear on the edge of the driver's seat, and it isn't much. Rear of the interior looks new.
 -Power locks/windows work (sometimes finicky)
 -I trusted this car all winter, and it got me and the kids everywhere with no problem. 
-Looks good. This one could easily be turned into a real head turner.
 -Is a daily driver in the winter, and I make sure to take a small trip in it once a week or so in the summer.

THE BAD:
 -Transmission will need work soon. Started slipping this spring. Beyond my mechanical ability, so I don't know if it is a 'fix' or a 'replace' situation. I am pricing the truck as if it needs the transmission replaced.
 -Valve cover needs tightened or gasket replaced. Have driven truck 3,000 miles without having to add oil, so it's very minor. I never felt the need to mess with it.
 -Has rust. The bad rust is the bottom of the driver's side. Frame is strong and not rusted out. Pictures are from last fall, and the rust has taken just a bit more of the driver's side door since the pictures were taken. Exterior still far above average for a Bronco II.
 -AC needs charged and radio doesn't work for some unknown reason.
 -Rear liftgate struts are old, so the back hatch doesn't hold itself up very well unless it's hot outside.

I hate to let my Bronco II go, but I am rushing around to relocate for a new job, and I am not going to have the time, space or money to spend messing with it. Clear title in hand (just renewed tags last week, just my luck). I know what junkyard prices are, and the wheels/tires on this one would be easy to sell seperately. The truck, particularly the transmission, needing an unknown amount work is the only reason this truck is priced this low. I would be fixing it myself if I didn't have to move suddenly.

ASKING $850. Open to 'certain types' of trades.

Once again, the pictures are almost a year old, and the rust is a little worse than the pictures show.  Still a very good looking little Bronco II."

This rifle was built using a new and unfired 2011 Ruger 10/22 Carbine receiver. The bolt is the polished style found in the 10/22 target models. The trigger group is the metal type and not the plastic one used in the newer builds. The barrel is from a new and unfired SR22. The wood handguard attaches magnetically so no holes are drilled into the stock or barrel. All this topped off with a 40mm red dot scope mounted on the OD green scope mount that matches the stock.

A neat clean looking rifle build that has no match out there. If you're tired of all the cookie cutter rifle builds and want something no one else has, check this out.

The sights themselves are in perfect condition with no wear present. 

The bore is in pristine condition, extremely shiny with a small amount of powder fouling present and no corrosion. The 2 groove rifling is perfect with sharp edges, and the grooves show no buildup where they meet the rifling. The barrel is practically brand new. 

The action is also much smoother than my other two Springfields, and may or may not have been worked on. The trigger is extremely smooth and light with absolutely no creep, and a light and clean break, that again may or may not have had work done to it. 

The parkerizing on the firearm is in perfect shape no fading or noticable wear except for a couple of small scrapes at the end of the barrel. The bluing on the bolt is a perfect black worn only from operating the action. The bolt face is the same. The peripheral parts, such as the barrel bands, floor plate, and end cap exhibit a little more wear. The barrel bands still retain most of their bluing with some combat scrapes present. The floor plate has virtually no finish left and could be polished. The end cap retains most of the blueing with some wear present. The buttplate also has most of the blue still intact, although not shiny. There is also a small amount of older corrosion present that appears inactive. The follower in the fixed magazine appears to have been polished. 

The stock is near perfect with some white flecks on the left side. The only small dings are in the bottom of the buttstock where the plate meets the wood, and behind the trigger guard. The worst wear is in front of the first barrel band where it appears someone did not loosen it before taking it off. This also seems to be an older scrape as it has smoothed over from handling and looks much worse in the picture than in reality. Overall the rifle is in exceptional condition and match ready.

As set up, it is nearly identical to the M-16 A4, a common DMR (Designated Marksman Rifle) in use with our nations military.  Has fired around 300 rounds and has minor handling wear (as much as you'd expect it to have from the few range trips it has had).  Is in great working condition, I just wanted to explain that while it is in excellent working condition, it is not new.  It is a SAA lower, Surplus Ammo & Arms (whom used to manufacture for Armalite and Spikes before going into their own business).  Upper is a Rock River Arms.  Has KAC M5 rail system, the same in use with our US military which retail for around $390 by themselves.  Also uses a Troy flip-up rear sight, which sells for around $100-140.  Comes with the Magpul ladder rail protectors (with cuts for light and pressure switch) and P-Mag as seen.  What you see in the picture comes with the purchase (unless we negotiate otherwise).

Details:  20"" HBAR 1/9 twist, chrome-lined barrel, 5.56/.223, A2 buttstock and grip and front sight, flat-top, KAC M5 RIS, Troy rear flip sight.

Am willing to negotiate in price and meet location (best offers obviously get preference).  *Greatly* preferring cash on this one, but will consider full/partial trades *only* if they are decidedly in my favor (fiber optic ACOG's, M1A, what have you got?).

I CHALLENGE YOU TO FIND A RUGER MARK ONE WITH A MUZZLE BREAK.  THEN I CHALLENGE YOU TO FIND A SET OF RUGER MARK ONE GRIPS.  I WAS TOLD BY A GUN GRIP DEALER THAT I COULD NOT FIND A SET OF THESE GRIPS.  I WAS LUCKY ROSE GUN STORE HAD A SET, I LOOKED ON THE WEB, NO LUCK.  I DO NOT THINK OR AT LEAST IT WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A SET OF RUGER WOOD GRIPS TO FIT THIS MARK ONE.  THEN THERE IS THE MUZZLE BREAK, I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN FIRE ARMS FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND THIS IS THE FIRST RUGER WITH A MUZZLE BREAK THAT I REMEMBER SEEING.
THE GRIPS ALONE IS WORTH WHAT EVER A PERSON WHO HAS A MARK ON MADE BETWEEN 1953 TO 1958 WHEN RUGER MOVED THE SCREW HOLE BY A HALF OF AN INCH.  THIS GUN CAME OUT AROUND 1948,  ROSE GUN SHOP HAD SEVERAL PAIRS OF THE FIRST ISSUE, BUT ONLY ONE PAIR OF WOOD GRIPS FOR THIS GUN.
I AM ONLY PLACING THIS ADD FOR A FEW DAYS, MAYBE ONE WEEK THEN IT GOES AWAY FOR GOOD.  I AM GETTING TO OLD TO SHOOT, BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE A COLLECTOR A CHANCE TO BUY THIS GUN, IS IT TO HIGH THAT IS  UP TO YOU.  THE GRIPS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE GUN THAT IS IN 98% MINT CONDITION.
THE MUZZLE BREAK WAS INSTALLED BY RUGER AT THE  FACTORY WHEN IT WAS MADE."
