The new owner will also receive the original build letter from IGF dated 09/05/01. This has been fired under 100 times, is in excellent condition and functions flawlessly.

Includes telescoping HK stock, wood stock, bayonet and sheath, 10- 20 Round HK G3 Magazines, 4-20 round Thermold Magazines, 3-20 Round CETME Magazines. It currently has a HK Navy trigger group with a Bill Springfield trigger job installed and also includes an original steel trigger group.

Please note the H&K Navy trigger group in the pictures shows the clipped ears that fit onto the semi auto receiver. The ""pin"" in place is a pair of plastic caps to only simulate the appearance of the original select fire configuration. Please keep in mind this is one of the rifles that will be illegal to purchase if Feinstein gets her way. This is your chance to have a quality rifle that last for a long time at a great price.

The specific model I have for sale is the Cougar 8000 FT, in 9mm.
It is one of the updated models with a rail (see pics).
In addition to the two 15-round factory mags (made in Italy), I have one 15-round Pro-mag for it (which has worked flawlessly).

I bought the pistol new on October 26th, and so it is barely 3 months old. I've taken it to the range about five times, and have shot approximately 300 rounds through it. It is in like-new condition and I've had no problems at all with it.

It has a 3.6"" barrel, weights 32.6 oz, and has a very low recoil of 4.14 ft-lbs
See: http://www.genitron.com/Handgun/Stoe...9-mm/Variant-1

In my opinion (and why I bought it), it offers one of the very best combinations of size, weight and recoil -- especially for the money. I'm actually torn as to whether or not to sell it because I think its design is excellent. But I am not using it and promised my wife I would sell off a few pistols.

I have also modified the trigger, replacing the original mainspring to ease what was a very heavy pull. This, in my opinion, has resulted in an outstanding trigger, smooth & crisp. You can google ""Cougar D spring"" if you're curious about it.

Other features:
- all metal (though only 5oz more than Beretta's polymer PX4, what they moved to after selling the Cougar line).
- manual safety
- rotating barrel (improves accuracy and reduces felt recoil)
- stainless steel guide rod
- updated design with accessory rail
- original case & paperwork

Local price for the pistol is currently about $525 (incl. tax). Factor in the extra magazine, and we're at $550+.

Armslist & Gunbroker ads range from $400-$475 used (I'm adding an extra mag and this is the new model of the pistol, with a rail).

So, I'm listing it at $450 obo -- (cash only).  If you're short on ammo, I can sell you a couple of boxes with the pistol (50 rounds/box, 115 grain, FMJ, $15/box).

Face-to-face (I'm in Edmond but can also meet in OKC or Stillwater).

The only trade I would be interested in would be a Savage 93R17 BTV (or a different 93R17 model with a thumb-hole stock added)."

The Smith & Wesson Model 457 is a compact semi-automatic pistol from Smith & Wesson's metal frame series of handguns. The 457 is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. The 457 is a traditional double-action pistol, meaning that the first shot is fired in double-action mode and the following shots are fired in single-action mode. The 457 has a 3.75-inch barrel and 7-round magazine capacity. 

The compact design of the pistol makes it ideal for concealed carry. There is no spur on the hammer, thereby reducing the risk of being caught on clothing during unholstering"

The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle."

I'm looking to buy two PSA stripped lowers. Preferably in the Newberry or Clinton area but can come to harbison area. I'd really prefer if they had sequential serial numbers as they are for a build i'm doing with my future wife as wedding presents to each other. not a deal breaker if they aren't though.

I refuse to pay outrageous prices but I'd pay $400 for the pair, $425 if the serial numbers are sequential. I don't want blemished parts either. I have cash on hand available for the right person. 

Dont email me just to tell me i'm crazy. 

I can buy complete lower receivers for $199 each with the lower build kits already installed but they are polymer. In a few months after this is all passed they'll be $100 again.

I'd be interested in trading some ammo if you'd prefer too. However, if I'm valuing a 100 lower at 200, my $20 brick of .22 is gonna trade at $40 value.

I have most of the common calibers.

.22lr
9mm
.40
.223
5.56
.308

It's either .223 OR 5.56, not both. 5.56 is a military round loaded to NATO specs. Which equates to higher pressures. It is NOT safe to fire in a gun chambered in .223 with a few rifles being exceptions. The throat is longer on a 5.56 rifle compared to a .223 chamber. The 223 is based on SAAMI specs aka lower pressures and shorter throat. You can safely fire .223 in a 5.56 chamber but generally not vice versa. Just a little info most people aren't aware of.

AK-47 bumpski stock made from 100% billeted aluminum. This stock does it all. Fits the AK-47, AK-74, and the saiga shotguns. 
The bumpski will have the ability to be attached to different firearms simply by purchasing a different attachment bar. That is right. You simply remove the bottom half of the bumpski, purchase a different attachment for your SKS, Mini-14, or AR-15 and you do not have to buy a new stock time after time.
Bump firing is the legal act of using the recoil of a firearm to fire multiple shots in rapid succession.  The relatively-rapid bursts from semi-automatic firearms simulate the discharge of automatic firearms. Even though a large number of rounds are fired in rapid succession, the trigger finger initiates each discharge; therefore, fully automatic fire is not actually taking place.

It does not have exposed hammers. Definitely a beast of a shooter, it's a pretty heavy gun so that takes away a lot of the recoil that comes with a 10 gauge. I don't have to sell or get rid of the gun, just seeing what all is out there. Also comes with a nearly full box of shells. It's a real quality piece, do your research and you'll see for yourself. If you're interested, just shoot me an email and make an offer."

Also Have 6 boxes of Federal Premium 30-06 Nosler Tip for $200 or $35 a box. Trade Value $250. Will create different listing for these as well, but thought I'd mention them here if anyone is interested

Only problem is that it wont hold a charge but if you know anything about this light, thats a common problem. its easy to replace the battery. It still works perfectly when plugged into a car or a wall outlet. This light is good to 2400 meters. You can blind aliens in space with this thing.

In the world of tactical military weapons, human lives are on the line every day. Contractors that build weapons for the U.S. Government need confidence that their components are the highest possible quality. They purchase parts from a select few manufacturers that have a proven record of consistent quality and attention to detail. AO Precision is one of these elite suppliers.

AO Precision is a major provider for the M16 and M4 parts contract for upper receivers, bolts, carriers and barrel extensions. We are also sole source to the U.S. Government for breech bolt assemblies for the M61A1 20mm Vulcan cannon. The company produces parts for the M249 SAW and M240 Machine gun and USSOCOM suppressor components.

AO Precision supplies many of the most respected of the AR-15 rifle producers. These include Alexander Arms, Bulldog Barrels, Del-Ton, DSA, Krieger Barrels, Lothar Walther, LaRue Tactical, LWRC, Noveske, O.F. Mossberg, Primary Weapons Systems, Rock River Arms, SIG Sauer, E.R. Shaw Barrels, Smith & Wesson, Spike’s Tactical, Wilson Arms and Wilson Combat. Our critical parts – bolts, carriers, barrel extensions and receivers – are considered the best available."

It has a scope, with scope rings attached. A laser bore sight for .223. (3) .223 five round magazines, and (2) .222 five round magazines.
Also comes with 140 rounds of .222 Remington.
Has a 1:14 twist, which prefers the 55gr loads, and fires milsurp 5.56 well.
Valued around $859.
Only reason I'm wanting to trade is because of the craziness for .223 at this time, and I just picked up another bolt action, so the rifle fills a role I have filled in other ways.
Very little interest in cash, just trades. 


I also have an Mtech crossbow rated at 80 lbs, if I recall. It's all set up, and hardly used. Shoulder injury doesn't allow me to use it anymore. The bolts for it have been lost in a move, so the $100 dollar value is closer to $75.
Not expecting to get much for it, just hoping it can sweeten a trade.

I value my privacy, so if I don't get back to you anytime after 4PM, I'm not interested in your trade. I just don't want to send my email out to people I don't want to do business with.

It's all black and full size, steel frame, not picky on ammo. The gun comes with the original hard case, 2 15 round magazines, trigger lock, Blackhawk holster and a cleaning rod.

Call or text 4176694655 for more info or to send me offers. I will take cash offers or I might trade for other pistols but they would have to be compact, maybe a home defense shotgun.

I am wanting $625 for the lot.  I would be willing to split up, but it would have to be worth my time.  I know what I paid and what they are worth.

This is all quality Brass Cased, Boxer Primed, NEW ammo.  No steel crap that will wear your chamber.  No tax, waiting in line, or bickering with questionable people.  First CASH takes it.  No holding till Monday or excused like that.  There it is, plain and simple.  I will meet you anywhere between Lexington and Elizabethtown.

pistol up for sale.

Since owning one several years ago, the Glock 29 has remained one of my favorite
pistols - real power in a compact size that fits my hand wonderfully and shoots
like a dream. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I absolutely love 10mm!

I was ecstatic when a LEO friend offered to sell me his blue label Gen 4 Glock
29 last November. He had put less than 100 rounds through it and I have put
about the same so all told this beauty has seen less than 200 rounds down the
pipe. No hiccups. No malfunctions. Great stuff... FUN stuff!

As for mods, I had a local gunsmith install Warren Tactical fiber optic sights
but have otherwise left it stock.

In addition to the pistol with 3 mags and box with all standard accessories, I
am also including 5 additional 10-round mags (I hate loading mags at the range)
for a total of 8 mags, and 2 blue gun training mags (for safe dry fire and
reload practice.)

Now I'm sure you are asking ""WTF! Why is he selling this?!?!"" Well...

Unfortunately Uncle Sam came knocking with a fairly hefty tax bill this year
instead of the usual refund (the nerve of some people!) and I hate to say it but
I need to raise some money to make him go away. All told I have right at $850 in
this great package and that is what I need to get back out of it.

So, all of this goes to the first lucky person with $850 cash who can meet me
FTF in the Matthews NC area with a CCP or NC pistol purchase permit OR the first
person to say ""That's mine now dude!"" and pay the $850 plus shipping via PayPal
gift or money order to have this shipped to the FFL of their choosing.

I can tell you this: once the Uncle with his hand out is sent on his merry way
and I can save the funds, I will have another of these babies to carry in the
warmer weather.

A new Israeli extractor and extractor spring were installed after purchase. The serial number starts with GAL and the ejector lug and receiver looks great, good feed ramp. There have been between 350 and 500 rounds fired through the rifle since I purchased it new. Chromed bore is in fantastic shape. Shoots brass or steel case ammo.
This rifle is a combination of an AR-15 and an AK-47. The receiver is milled and the folding stock is very solid and locks up tight, made from steel tubing and a cast aluminum butt section. This rifle has a chromed gas piston and a right side charging handle, that can be charged with the left hand also as it is vertically oriented. The rifle is much more accurate than the typical AK-47 type design. Chrome lined barrel. The front sight hood is a full circle, so it is easy to line up with the ar style flip 2 size peep rear sights. There are flip up night sights but the tritium does not glow, the night sights can be replaced by new mepro sights from Optics Planet for about $80.
The magazines are all in very good shape and are metal, not plastic. There are (12) 35 round magazines. There are (5) 12 round magazines-purchased new (unused).

Taurus 617 .357 Mag. Revolver - 7rd Blue

An incredible seven shots available at a moment's notice. The 617 revolvers provide the advantage of the extra round with Taurus' exclusive 7-shot cylinder. Soft rubber grips and low-profile sights make these revolvers a most desirable carry option for law enforcement professionals or for self-defense. Add in a yoke detent, and solid steel construction and there really is no competition for this hard-hitting combination of customer-requested features.

Taurus Security System (TSS)
 Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

7 Rd Cylinder Feature
 Some Taurus models offer our 7-shot cylinder. A shot above the rest.

 The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.
