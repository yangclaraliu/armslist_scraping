This gun is in 99% condition, I say 99% as it is used but not much!!! No rust, scratches, or any other issues. It is flawless.

When I say highly collectable, first off it was made in 1975, this was the first year Ruger made this gun in Stainless Steel, also this is a PRE-WARNING revolver. In 1977 Ruger started put warning stamps on the barrel stating to read owners manuel etc... before using the gun. My gun has no warning, lastly it is the snub nose version made with a 2 3/4"" barrel, these are alot harder to come by as the production numbers on these length barrels were very limited. It has adjustable sights as well. Try and find a 2 3/4"" Pre warning in this condition, you wont, I searched two years before I found this one and it was a fluke, they are just not out there for sale very often???

I have a nice pair of Hogue Grips on the gun and I also have the original wooden grips, the original grips are mint condition. This gun has been fired very little and lockup is super tight and the trigger in single action is crisp, so crisp and light it is amazing. One of the best pistols I have ever owned and fired. Selling it to fund another project!

Lastly this gun comes with a handmade leather holster, this holster was special made for this gun and the two combine for a excellent carry piece.
This gun also comes with two Dade speed loaders and some ammo.

I will accept reasonable offers on this gun package. Additional pictures available upon request. Wichita area only FTF"

It is a front wheel drive turbo. It is white with a black top-half. The air conditioning always worked great.  Newish tires and an upgraded clutch with about 25k miles in it.  The interior is very clean; the only problem is sun fading of the rear seats. I put a j-spec engine in it and I still have the old blown engine that I will include in the deal. It has a two stage manual/electronic boost controller. Also has a full 2.5 inch turbo-back exhaust. I will include the stock exhaust too. I recently had the turbo rebuilt in Golden by TEC (I have only put 8-10 miles on it since then!). The turbo is larger than the stock turbo and it made a big difference (the size is called 16G).  Also I had the injectors tested and cleaned. I used to get 32 mpg travelling up in the mountains with this car. It is a fast and fun high miles-per-gallon car.

There is very little needed to get the car running. I think there is a ignition controller that needs replaced to get it running again. Someone can get a great little car if they want to put a little work into it.

250,http://www.armslist.com/posts/473250,For Trade:  LEFT HANDED Ibanez RG1570L Prestige/Crate Half Stack,"Titusville, Pennsylvania, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Sunday, July 15, 2012",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm interested in trading my Ibanez RG1570L Prestige w/Crate Half Stack amp (GX900H head and 4x12"" cab). This rig is worth $800 easily. So, I'm looking to trade according to the cash value I invested into the rig. 

So, if I was to trade it straight up (no cash either way involved) I'd be looking for a nice AR. Or, if you by chance happen to have a nice sub compact 9mm and a Mossberg 500 Cruiser I'd go for that too. 

I'm interested in Kel Tec, Glock, Springfield, Kahr, Mossberg, Stag, S&W M&P 15, stuff like that. 

Specifically I'm looking into getting a S&W M&P 15, or a Glock 26 (I don't care which generation you've got). I also like the Kel Tec P11, PF9 and P3AT....which reminds me, I also like the Ruger LCP/LC9/LCR. I dig the Taurus revolvers too. As far as Kahr, Springfield and Mossberg....I like the Kahr CM9, Springfield XD sub compacts and the Mossberg 500 Cruiser tactical shotguns. Might as well throw the Remington 870 in there too. 

This Ibanez RG has green mirrored cavity covers, Wilkinson EZ Lock tuners, stainless screws for all covers, stainless intonation bolts for the saddles. The pups have been upgraded (except the middle, it's stock) and are brand new. Aside from the middle pup all the electronics are brand new. It had 500k CTS pots that are LEFT HANDED pots! It has a ""JPM"" (John Petrucci ""Picaso"" style) graphics kit currently installed, but it's easily removable. The factory paint is in GREAT shape with no bumps or bruises to speak of. VERY nice guitar. The half stack was barely used as I mainly play through a rackmount system. It has been taking very well care of. 

If what you have doesn't equal the value of what I've got for trade then I'll accept partial cash too. I'd prefer to make a clean swap though. If you are from out of state or otherwise wouldn't be able to meet FTF to do the swap (if trading handguns then we'd have to meet at my FFL) then I'd be willing to ship these items to you (at your expense!) and you could ship any guns to my FFL (I'd pay shipping to my FFL). If interested let me know. Thanks. 



Guitar also comes with new strings, gigbag and needs setup/wired to your preference. Strap shown in pic is NOT included."

Both were imported by Century Arms, Both have a Muzzle Brake that was professionally installed by C.A.I, and both with the exception of the Muzzle Brake are in Original Condition. These SKS's are not modified or tampered with in any way like most that you would see (Tapco Stocks, 30rnd AK Styled Mags, Pistol Grips). Only Fired 10 rounds through Top SKS and 5 rounds through bottom. Top SKS appears to have been issued through a Soldiers hands in the past as the Bottom appears to be unissued (Brand New). Both have a Folding Bayonet, Leaf Sights and ""Flip-Up"" Night Sights, Top one doesnt work due to old age and Bottom has Tritium Sights that barely have any illumination at all. This is normal as these rifles were both made in the early 70's. I can provide more pics through e-mail if necessary. 

Top SKS - $260  Bottom SKS - $300  OR  Both - $540

Would like to see I.D. and I will include a Bill of Sale for the buyer. I live in B-Ham but I am willing to go out as far as Marysville to make the sale.

If you want it, either come over to my place if you live Beyond Marysville or I can come to you if you live Anywhere Between Marysville and Bellingham.

I am selling one of my shotguns. It is an older Remington 870 Wingmaster in 12g. This is a solid shotgun with a 26"" bead sight barrel for skeet/birds; has the metal trigger and small parts, not cheap plastic like the 870 Express. There is some superficial rust flecking on one side of the receiver, but it doesn't affect performance and it isn't too bad. This is a good, solid shoot-able gun, not a safe queen but still in decent condition. The laminated wood fore end and stock is in excellent condition and looks great. This takes 2 3/4"" shells, not 3"", but that has never been an issue for me. A new one goes for $599. I am asking half that, which I feel is fair for something that is used but serviceable. Email me and I will take some pics for you.

Thanks!"

Other methods of obtaining a firearm can involve sales tax, reams of paperwork, shipping charges, FFL transfer fees, travel, etc.

There’s a fool born every day who will pay more for something than it’s worth.  If you’re a slick salesman and can get more – good for you.  There are opportunistic people out there who would love to take advantage of someone experiencing financial difficulty, but let’s not talk about the mortgage industry now.

A new gun is worth more than the same used gun when all else is equal.  Used firearms, like used cars, can have mechanical problems.  You can sell your mechanical problems to someone else, and there is no law that says you have to disclose the problem.  Let the buyer beware.

Fair market value is about supply and demand.  “Market” is the price someone can and will spend to obtain a comparable gun.  Abundance will drive the price down and scarcity will drive the price up. 

If you and I have comparable guns for sale/trade in the same geographic area, and you’re asking $500 and I’m asking $400, it doesn’t really matter how pretty you are.  My gun is the better value in the eyes of a buyer.  On the other hand, if my price is higher, then maybe my wife politely suggested that I “SELL SOME OF THOSE DAMN GUNS” and placing this ad gets her off my case without really risking my guns.  

Nobody likes finding out they paid too much for something.  When you list a gun at close to what you paid for it, and people point out that there are cheaper prices elsewhere for comparable guns, they are NOT putting you down.  They’re interested in your gun, or they wouldn’t have looked.  They’re weighing all the factors between getting the gun from you and getting it elsewhere.  Maybe if your asking price was little closer to market, they’d buy it.  It's called negotiating."

He is not Happy because he really liked the looks of the Tomos because it looks like a motorcycle, and unlike when I was a kid, it doesn't have any pedals! I bought the Tomos recently and it is in good mechanical condition. It runs @ a top speed of around 37 MPH on my phone GPS, and has plenty of storage in the tank area (the real gas tank is under the seat). It averages 76 mpg and everything works as it should. It comes w/ a matching helmet and additional parts. I have the original Certificate of Origin on hand (no title is issued because it is a 49cc bike and is legal to ride w/o plates and or registration and uninsured). These bikes have a sort of cult following and are extremely well made. Do an internet search and you will see that there are still many of these bikes on the road from the 80's and 90's! These are made in Europe in Slovenia and the Netherlands. These are high quality bikes and far exceed the current Chinese Scooters being imported. But if you are looking at this ad, you probably know this! These bikes sell for $1799.00 new. Kelly Blue Book has this bike coming in at $1250.00 retail and $795.00 dealer trade in.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

This is the Carbon 15 M4 model that is both light and durable.  Bushmaster claims that the carbon upper and lower receivers are 40% stronger and lighter than aluminum.  I am the second owner and have put a hundred rounds through it of various manufacturers and grains.  It comes with a carbine stock endplate sling mount installed.  It also has a Viking Tactical quick adjustment sling and quad rail weapon light mount.  It has a forward grip with battery compartments, flashlight, ladder rail covers and is currently set up with a Tasco 30mm tube style red dot sight.  The sight is inexpensive but works really well.  It is similar in function to a low mount Aimpoint sight in that it allows you to cowitness with the iron sights and still look over the fixed rear sight just to use the red dot.  The front sight post is illuminated as well, but I don't know what brand.  The barrel is 1/9 twist and it shoots both 5.56 and .223.  If you have any questions, email."

It has fixed sights as you can see from the picture(s). It came with the black soft case. It has TWO (2) 13 round magazines. The RIGHT side of the slide is stamped ""MADE IN BELGIUM BY FABRIQUE NATIONALE HERSTAL"". The LEFT side of the slide is stamped ""BROWNING ARMS COMPANY MORGAN, UTAH & MONTREAL P.Q."". This pistol has no more than 500 rounds through it. The only flaw is a very, very small ""knick"" in the top of the slide which I have never tried to ""rub out"". Outside of that it is excellent.  The second one is a Browning BDA in .380. It has the nickel finish, TWO (2) 13 round magazines and I have the box it came in with owners manual.
