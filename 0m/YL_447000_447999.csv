I got this bike and it wouldn't go over 35mph. Now it is a beast. I cruise all day at highway speed and get 40mpg. Has 4-1 Kerker exsaust, individual pod filters, jetted up, new tires (bout 95-99% tread) and fresh OD green paint. Title is good and in my name. I ride it daily. The only thing wrong with it is it needs an oil pan gasket and an RPM gauge cable. It leaks a little oil. I have had this bike for about 6 months now and yesterday I put 1/2 qt in it, so it don't leak much. The carbs could use a sync, but like I said, it runs great as is.

 This vest is brand new and has never been used.  I got it for a job that I did not end up needing it for.   It was made in 9/07 and is still in the original packaging as you can see in the picture.  This vest has a black carrier and has the updated adjustable straps.  This vest has been stored flat inside a second bag for protection.  My home is pet and smoke free, and always temperature controlled.  

There is no wait time, no back orders, and this vest is ready to ship out.  It is a size “1RC/1LRC” which I was told by Safariland means its is an extra large.  This vest includes the original warranty registration that has the panels serial numbers, just as it came new.  This vest is listed on other boards, so first person who says they will take it on the timestamp will be the one who gets it.  I do not think that will happen because it will take some time to brainstorm, but wanted to say that so its fair and your aware.    If you have any questions, please feel free to ask, lets brainstorm towards a deal."

I've used on my SW MP 15 a few times at the range and  put a few 100 rounds down range with the sight.  While not a real holosight it is a low parallax red dot sight. I've used a real EOtech and ACOG during a tour in Iraq and I'm not going to say the quality is equal but it is comparable considering the price and the fact IR isn't necessary for 99% of rec shooters.  I had no problem hitting 200-250m targets with good accuracy.  I didn't have the $ for a real EOtech, ACOG, or Aimpoint when I needed the sight but it will stand in as a serviceable red dot sight for anyone who can't drop $500 on a name brand. It's also considered top of the line for anybody needing an airsoft sight.  Hurricane is very hard to find these days and I've finally saved enough for an upgrade.  Has 11 levels of brightness and a red or green color reticule, great price for a like new sight."

I've used on my SW MP 15 a few times at the range and  put a few 100 rounds down range with the sight.  While not a real holosight it is a low parallax red dot sight. I've used a real EOtech and ACOG during a tour in Iraq and I'm not going to say the quality is equal but it is comparable considering the price and the fact IR isn't necessary for 99% of rec shooters.  I had no problem hitting 200-250m targets with good accuracy.  I didn't have the $ for a real EOtech, ACOG, or Aimpoint when I needed the sight but it will stand in as a serviceable red dot sight for anyone who can't drop $500 on a name brand. It's also considered top of the line for anybody needing an airsoft sight.  Hurricane is very hard to find these days and I've finally saved enough for an upgrade.  Has 11 levels of brightness and a red or green color reticule, great price for a like new sight."

Every day as we pick up the paper, watch the news, listen to the radio, and talk to friends, we are continually assaulted with the reality that violent crime is an epidemic. It has no boundaries, no color, and there is no clear end in sight. This tidal wave of violence is simply overwhelming police resources that are already stretched to the breaking point. We once took law enforcement resources for granted as our first, and perhaps even as our only line of defense, but we are waking up to the fact that the police are too few and far in-between to ever be our bodyguards. 

In 2008, we saw double-digit increases in aggravated assaults in both Tulsa and Oklahoma City: over 23% in OKC, and nearly 11% in Tulsa. In 2009 we saw a record-breaking 70 homicides, surpassing the previous record of 69 set in 2003, and a new high of 29 bank robberies. While all-time crime records are set, our police forces across the nation are making deep cuts to available manpower. Instead of departments being bolstered, many divisions within those departments are being cleaned out to the point of nonexistence. Every day, we hear more stories of overcrowded prisons resulting in the release of hardened, convicted criminals back into the general public far ahead of their sentences. People are beheaded in buses while nobody present lifted a finger to stop it. We read news of crazed lunatics shooting up hospitals, churches, schools, colleges, universities, courthouses, government buildings, buses full of children, and malls. Pastors are murdered in front of their congregations. People are raped and killed in broad daylight. Locally, a man was shot and killed in front of hundreds of other people while nobody did anything to stop the crime as it happened; people present even stepped over EMS workers while they were still trying to assist the victim. In the aftermath of that incident, everyone refused to cooperate with the police, and only a few months later three more individuals were shot at the same location. 

Every day, we better understand that when seconds count, the police are only minutes away. Therefore, the burden of self-defense rests on us: not on our government, our military, the state, or even our local police, but on us, the silent majority of working citizens who are present in nearly every case these incidents transpire. 

The state-mandated Oklahoma Concealed Carry class is designed to teach gun safety and serve as an introduction to the state's Self Defense Act (SDA) laws, nothing more. Thus, it is severely deficient in its ability to adequately educate, prepare, and train you for the realities of self-defense that you face as a law-abiding citizen carrying a concealed firearm in your daily life. Knowing the self-defense laws and being able to apply them in real-world situations are very different things. The ICC1 course is designed to address these issues and equip you with the appropriate knowledge to assist you in responding to a life-threatening situation. 



Here are a few of the questions we have designed the Defensive Pistol course curriculum to specifically address: 



• Do I know what type of people commit crimes, how they commit them, who they commit them against, and how to spot tell-tale signs of a crime about to happen? 

•Is my pistol a defensive tool I know how to competently operate, or am I merely expecting its mere presence and noise when fired to stop an attack? 
•Can I pull the trigger on a justified deadly force threat that is attempting to do serious physical injury or even kill me? 

•Am I a good enough shot to consistently hit what I'm aiming at without endangering those around me? 

•Do I know how to get my gun back in the fight quickly when it malfunctions? 
•What if one or two shots aren't enough to stop an assailant? What if ten shots isn't enough? 




Course overview: 

Defensive Pistol 1 is one full day of training including lecture, practical exercises, and live fire on the range. Many courses are focused on the needs of law enforcement and military. This pistol-focused class is designed for people who want to acquire real-world defensive pistol skill sets designed specifically for civilian carry.



You will learn: 






•How to select an appropriate firearm 
•How to manipulate your firearm as a defensive tool 

•How to shoot accurately and consistently, and how to speed up consistent accuracy 

•Quickly clearing malfunctions when your firearm experiences them 










You will need: 





•***Please Note: all below equipment is available for rental/purchase as needed - try before you buy! Don't let a lack of gear stop you from taking this class!***
•A semi-automatic pistol and at least 2 magazines 

•200 rounds of ammunition
•Ear and eye protection 

•A folding camp chair for your comfort 
•Money for lunch 

•Proper attire for the weather and conditions 
•A hat and/or sunscreen is advisable 




In self-defense, we only get one chance to do it right: the first time. We need to find out the realities of self-defense in a safe, controlled training environment where we get a ""do-over"" when our preparations or equipment fails. We do NOT want to find out what doesn't work in a dirty mall parking lot where failure means serious bodily harm or even death; we would much rather discover those deficiencies in our preparation and equipment in training so we won't have to fail when it matters! 

You will never be set up to fail in this course. Our staff is certified, friendly, competent, proficient, fun, and professional. This course is designed to improve you from the very first moment you step in our door, starting from any skill level, with your own equipment, because the edge that you acquire from training will translate to a life-saving difference when it matters most. Pay attention in class, apply what you learn, and you will succeed in every single exercise!"

This Rifle has never been fired with the 0riginal Box and what's left of the rough looking label says BVSS.   I did as you can see, install a Bi-pod because such an accurate rifle needs the stability for it to deliver it's package dead on the money every time.    Spectacularly accurate weapon.

26"" Fluted Stainless barrel, recessed Muzzle, Pillar bedded Laminated Wood Stock with Wundhammer Palm Swell and Never Fired.

This makes this Arm still New in the Box.

Serious people with Cash only need reply.
Text me at REDACTED and don't ask ""what is my bottom Dollar"".
To which I would reply ""go back in time and buy your own""~!  Or not reply at all because you're looking at it.

I don't mind keeping this spare rifle, it's not eaten a single round since I bought it new in 1998 and I will never feed it.

I believe from using my other, that this is the Perfect Sniper's Tool of the Trade.  It doesn't come close to my 1961 Mod 70 Winchester.

The Buy Price: $800.00 carved in stone Firm.   I truly hate parting with it, you should know that up front.

 No Scope comes with it and should you buy this Weapon, buy a Good, powerful scope, it deserves only the best and highly magnified, too.
it deserves a powerful Swarovski scope and I may back out of selling it.

Trades, you must have something extremely special to me and most probably Cash also.  I pretty much already own at least one of most weapons available.

Thanks for viewing."

 Walther PPS is short recoil operated, locked breech pistol that uses modified Browning type locking with tilting barrel. Frame of the gun is made from impact resistant polymer. Trigger is of double action only type, striker fired, with pre-cocked striker system, similar to QA system used in Walther P99 pistols. This system requires a manual recocking (by partial slide retraction) in the case of misfire. Gun is fitted with automated trigger safety and firing pin block; additional ""storage type"" safety is provided by removable backstrap of the grip; once backstrap is removed, the firing pin is automatically decocked and gun is blocked until the backstrap is reinstalled. This patented system is called QuickSafe by Walther. Sights are low profile, with rear sight adjustable for windage."

The romanian psl is not a dragunov but does resemble one. It is a designated marksmans rifle.

This is a kit, meaning they took a complete rifle and cut the receiver in half so they could import it is a non firearm.
This kit is all matching, includes trunnions,original barrel, Finish is excellent as is bore. 

You cannot find these anymore. 4 years ago a kit was $200. Now they are $575+.

All you need is a receiver to build this back into a firearm. It is legally not a firearm now so no need for license and all that mess. I know a person that is selling a receiver for $75(you wont find one for under $175) that I will give buyer of kit his info and you can buy/deal with him for that.
Check gunbroker.. The last 2 kits sold at $570+ shipping and the only current one on there is at $700 for the kit!!!

Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. INOX version.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. Sure, Firm Grip: The front and back of the grip are grooved on the 92FS and M9, while the M9A1 and 90-Two feature checkering. The grip frame is flared slightly at the base to enhance pointability and control. 
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.
92 FS. A LEGENDARY FIREARMS. 
The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history.
The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them.

To the extent your statement ""no Chicago sales"" means ""no sales in the city of Chicago,"" you are right that the ordinance prohibits transfers and the sale of firearms within city limits.  This applies regardless of whether the buyer is a Chicago resident or not.

However, to the extent you sell or trade your gun to a Chicago resident, there is no way--whatsoever--that you would suffer any legal consequence as a result of the buyer not registering the Sig you previously owned.  You say that if the gun was not registered and was used in a crime, you would be in trouble because the gun would ""still be in [your] name.""  Not true.  Are you complying with Illinois law?  If so, your bill of sale will clearly show that you no longer own that gun.  Accordingly, any cop who told you that you could be held responsible for a crime committed with a gun you lawfully sold is incorrect. 

""Sorry sir, despite the fact that you have this document showing that you no longer own this handgun, we have to take you in.  The Chicago resident who purchased your gun from you--and whose name appears as the buyer on your bill of sale--did not register the gun with the city and subsequently used it to commit numerous crimes.  So, unfortuantely for you, as a result of the fact that he did not register the gun, you are responsible for all crimes that were committed with this gun.""  Really, a cop told you that's what would happen?  Your legal research confirmed this?

Note that even if a crime was not committed, clearly you could not be held responsible for the buyer not registering the gun.  You don't even need to be a lawyer or do any legal research to figure this out.  Thing about it.  How could a non-resident of Chicago be charged under a Chicago ordinance for an alleged violation that occurred outside of city limits?  Does that make sense to you?

I don't want your gun, just figured I'd give a few minutes of free legal advice.  Any questions, feel free to ask."

The rifle is a M77 mark II in the 22-250 caliber. This caliber can shoot anything from a varmit upto deer sized game with ease. It is the same 22 caliber round as 223 ar-15 shoots but with twice the power behind it yet the same recoil.

The barrel is a 26"" stainless bull barrel with a target crown for added accuracy.
it has a 6 grove 1:14 twist rate.

The stock is a brown laminate custom stock with a wide foregrip for use on sandbag or a rest but ads alot of stability in the hand when shooting from a stand. It has been bedded and pillared and it does have a free floating barrel. This stock does add weight to the gun which of cource reduces felt recoil.

The bolt has had some work to it and is really fast. The trigger is a smooth and crisp two stage trigger. It has virtualy no slack and is great to shoot.

The scope is a Tasco Custom shop( this is not a cheap wal-mart scope nor is it the version for a pellet rifle) The scope is a 8x40x56mm, and yes you can see just about anything you want with it farther than you could even think of seeing with the naked eye. It has a very cool large focus knob on the side of the scope for a clearer target image. This is a 30mm scope tube so it lets in enought light to see long after shooting hours are over. The are a couple on armslist for sale out west if you are interested in the value and a closer look at it. Also comes with two 3"" sunshades which help alot with the stainless barrel reflecting in the objective lens.

This rifle also will include:
A Case Guard wildlife double scoped rifle case, ($115 at cabelas) its a luggage grade airline approved lockable case.

RCBS 22-250 Die set for reloading($30)

30- 55gr nosler ballistic tip bullets(unloaded)

30- new unfired brass 

60- once used brass

one box of 55gr nossler ballistic tip rounds already reloaded and ready to go

Hopefully I haven given a good discription of this rifle. It is certainly the best looking rifle I have ever owned and the most accurate. It would be a great hunting rifle or perfect for someone to put in a safe and shoot on the weekends for fun or even in compitition. If you would like pictures of anything specific please feel free to ask and I will get them for you. Thank you and have a great day."

Only 1500 were produced and they are already hard to find. Black super tough DLC coated with a 1 1/8” ported barrel. I’ve fired 2 shots through it for verification of function and it shoots fantastic! It fires flawlessly AND authoritatively! It comes with everything like new with box, paperwork, 1 box of ammo, AND holster. I personally purchased this brand new. This is an awesome and effective pocket/DEEP concealed carry gun! This is DEFINITELY more effective than ANY other CCW weapon that you may have had to leave behind due to size or weight! Selling elsewhere on Armslist or other gun auction sites for $300. Reason for selling, I have just accumulated too many of these Mini's and this one was chosen since it was in mint condition and the others were more used.

Cal 30 WCF with a 20 inch barrel, Has express two leaf folding rear sight a 2/3 mag tube and a cresent buttstock. The gun is in fine working order and shoots well, it is a collectiable gun of hunting history. For being 93 years old it is in decent shape the blueing and all the screws are orig to the gun. The gun appears to be a special order with the three above things. Cond of the gun is good retains some orig blueing, The forearm looks to of been sanded at one point and just has a walnut stain on it but the fit to metal is still good, I also have another forearm that has been fitted to the gun but would still need some work to make wood proud to metal. The cresent buttstock has never been sanded but has small chip each side where gun fits to reciver and appears someone added alittle extra finish to it, The gun is what it is a collectiable 1894 saddle ring would be a great hunting gun the way it is but if you want it perfect would try to replace wood with orig and you would have a 1200 gun. Please no low ball offers it is collectiable will also consider interesting trades. E-mailk me at REDACTED"

Burris Technology

Burris uses lenses with a greater diameter than the competition
• “Signature Select” scopes lenses are 40% larger than the competition in 1” tubes
• “Fullfield II” lenses are 25% larger than the competition in 
1” tubes

MODEL TUBE DIAMETER LENSES DIAMETER
Black Diamond™ 30 mm 15.4 mm
Euro Diamond™ 30 mm 15.4 mm
Signature Select™ 25.4 mm 15.4 mm
Fullfield® II 25.4 mm 13.8 mm
Others 30 mm 15 mm
Others 25.4 mm 11.0 mm



Unique Technical Features
The outer tubes & internal components are extremely robust.
The adjustment system is:
- repeatable
- steel on steel
- with audible clicks
Double internal spring force. Every Burris scope has it.



Posi-Lock
• Posi-Lock is a coil-spring assisted retractable steel post that firmly and & securely locks accuracy into place. 
• Once the reticle is zeroed, the covering tube (red) replaces the internal spring (green) & locks the inner tube in place. 
• All scopes have one spring that allows the adjustment of the reticle. 
Some of the competition competitors offer a double spring whereas the double spring is the STANDARD for all Burris products. 
• As an optional, it’s possible to have the special Posi-Lock system. 
Posi-Lock scopes remain perfectly zeroed year after year even during transportation.

In the closed position, the force of the spring is substituted by the force of the steel post on the internal tube of the scope.



On all rifle scopes:
• Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope
• Every scope is individually recoil, water and fogproof tested 
• Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage



Recoil Test
Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests
An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration.
This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.

Waterproof Test
All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof.
Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C.
The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. 


Fog Test
The nitrogen contained in the scope is:
• of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen)
• ultra pure
• ultra clean
To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of 
• pressurizing the scope
• subjecting it to a vacuum
The tests are both cost & time intensive


I do not have the packaging for either item.

I have a Intratec Tec-DC9 for sale. It is the same as the Tec-9, it is called the DC because Intratec changed the name in response to Washington DC banning the Tec-9 a few years after it came out. It has a shrouded and threaded barrel, an original barrel extension (impossible to find, there are aftermarket ones, but they don't look the same), and an Ohio legal 20 round magazine. The 32 round mags it came with are illegal to use (but not possess) in this state. Functions flawlessly. I have put around 500 rounds through it with no jams or FTF's. This Tec does not disappoint.

It shot great, however I just couldn’t get used to the feel of it as a larger grip is much more comfortable for me with larger hands.

GREAT CONDITION SPAS 12 only $1,100.00

Great condition SPAS 12 with the push button safety and an inspected recoil shock absorber.  Read the first 2 articles here http://spas12.com/ to see why that’s very important on these guns.  Search on armslist, floridaguntrader and gunbroker and you’ll see they range from $1150 to $1600.   The lower priced ones have the dangerous paddle safety.  For those of you who don’t know this gun is both a pump and semi auto shotgun it was banned from import in 1987 by George H. Bush because of it’s awesome looks and firepower.  It’s been featured in Miami Vice, Jurrassic Park and this was Arnolds shotgun in Terminator.  I will be back in FL from June 28th til July 1st so if you want it that will be it.  Price is firm.  Trades may be considered although I’d want more than $1,100 in trade value or trade plus.  Call or text 727-492-7451
