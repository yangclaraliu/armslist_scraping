GLOCK was the first manufacturer to make this popular and effective round accessible for law enforcement agencies. Today, police agencies across the U.S., and countless others throughout the world, put their trust in this pistol."

Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny Rail.

To give the Accumark stock a distinctive yet functional look, a matte black gel coat finish is accented with faint gray spider web patterning.

The CZ 85 Combat adds a fully adjustable rear sight, extended magazine release, drop-free magazine and overtravel adjustment on the trigger. The Combat designation comes from the lack of a firing pin block safety, allowing the replacement of the firing pin without tools.

Ambidextrous features include safety levers, slide stop levers and a reversible magazine release. The lack of a firing pin safety gives the 85 Combat a slight advantage in the trigger pull department, making it a long-time favorite of competition shooters.

I can't tell you how sweet this gun is to shoot. It drives nails at 100 yards (which is the distance I fired it at Boggy Head last month.)

Its hard to beat a Colt, for both quality and resale. Do some research on this model, and you will find a lot of good things.  I love this Rogers Super Stock (which has Colt markings on it).  I have a similar stock made by a different company which I feel does not compare as far as tightness. I also like the fact that it comes with detachable carry handle.  If you cant decide on iron sights vs optics, you can go either way with this. This is available for local pickup or delivery to your FFL. A weapons permit is required to purchase this as is the normal paperwork as I am a licensed dealer.  $1080 plus tax is the price.  Shipping cost are additional.  I will consider accepting trades towards the purchase of this fine rifle.  I am a dealer and if Im interested in your trade, I will offer 70-75% towards what I think is a guns retail value.  Here are the specs:

The Colt 6920 comes with the Rogers Super Stock with secondary lock. The Rogers Super Stock is now the standard stock from Colt on the 6920, 6940 and AR6450.
Includes (2) twenty round magazines, detachable carry handle and carry strap.


Lower is stamped with the Colt Logo and Colt spelled out M4 CARBINE CAL. 5.56MM and has a SN# that starts with LE. Has COLT DEFENSE HARTFORD, CONN. U.S.A. stamped on it. Fire and Safe marked on both sides of the receiver.

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the 6920 carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's 6920 carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

 - Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components
- Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm)
- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification
- Two 20 round magazines, cleaning kit and sling are standard.
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation

It is extremely nice to have a pistol and a carbine that uses the same mags.

BRITISH P-1837 EAST INDIA Co. BRUNSWICK 2 GROOVE RIFLE
This is the first British percussion military rifle to succeed the famous Baker flintlock of the Napoleonic era. Originally designed with eleven groove rifling, this Hanoverian design was rejected in favor of the standard 2 groove ""belted ball"" .704 caliber rifle. a design copied from the military of the Duke of Brunswick, a German cousin of Queen Victoria. These ""Brunswicks"" were issued exclusively to the British Home Army and the Indian Army rifle regiments. India at the time was under the authority of the Honorable East India Company and these percussion rifles were used to great effect in Britain's expanding Colonial empire. Originally adopted in 1837 using a back action percussion system, this was updated in 1847 to a percussion side lock system, and then surpassed in 1853 with the adoption of the p-1853 Percussion Rifled Musket, which became the standard for the entire British Military. It was issued exclusively to the British home army and Indian army rifle regiments (India at the time being under the honorable East Indian Company). This Brunswick rifles dates from the earlier back action design and comes complete. A 30 inch 2 groove rifled barrel, back action percussion lock, (At some point the original flintlock was replaced with the more modern percussion cap hammer mechanism.)

The original full wood stock is mounted with brass furniture; including trigger guard, butt plate, ramrod pipes and brass patch box in the butt. The rifle retains the original flip rear sights and heavy steel bayonet bar on the right side to carry the brass hilted sword bayonet. An important part of British Colonial history, this classic rifle saw service throughout the British empire.

This gun was manufactured before 1898 and is therefore legally considered an antique. It is totally legal to own it and ship it without a U.S. Federal Firearms License (FFL)"

BRITISH EAST INDIA Co. P-1771 BROWN BESS MUSKET WITH  PERCUSSION LOCK
From the extraordinary cache of arms purchased from the Royal Nepalese Armory; an original 18th Century British Brown Bess Flintlock Muskets.  Regrettably, they were in a deplorable condition having arrived in Nepal via the East India Company sometime before 1820 and laid undisturbed, and not cared for, since the 1850’s. These Brown Bess Muskets are the East India Company Pattern of 1771 featuring a 39"" barrel. The British Government adopted the 39"" barrel (reduced in length from the 42” Short Land Pattern) in 1796. This is why these muskets are commonly referred to as ""The Brown Bess India Pattern of 1796"" or the Brown Bess 3rd model.

The Flintlock Locks were all made in England for the East India Company and but the original English maker markings were removed once in Gurkha hands, after 1816, and replaced with a Gurkha Nepalese crest. At some point the original flintlock was replaced with the more modern percussion cap hammer mechanism. The percussion lock bears the crest of the Royal Nepalese Armory.

• Modified English made Percussion lock with Royal Nepalese Crest marking. Fully integrated to the original stock, operational, cleaned and oiled. Not intended for firing.
• Original Brown Bess 39” Barrel made by the East India Company in India and features Anglo Indian proof marks. 
• Original all steel button nosed ramrod, cleaned, oiled and installed.
• Original oiled hardwood stock, pattern 1808, complete with all brass mounts, butt plate, trigger guard, side plate and ramrod pipes (3) together with the original trigger assembly.

Own your very own piece of British colonial history. This original musket is old enough to have taken part in the American war for Independence but it didn't, it was half a world away building an Empire in the Indian subcontinent. 

This gun was manufactured before 1898 and is therefore legally considered an antique. It is totally legal to own it and ship it without a U.S. Federal Firearms License (FFL)"

I have a massive 3' by 3' mirror that spells out the word ""SEXY"" Each letter is outlined with white LED's and looks amazing. I believe this once came from a victoria secret retail store and since all the furnishings are usually destroyed once they have been used, this thing is one of a kind and can't be found anywhere else. Because of its size and my lack of truck, you would have to come to me to pick this thing up. Plugs into a regular wall outlet, all the bulbs work. Got an anniversary coming up? Wife/ daughter have a birthday? Get something no one else has, without having to spend a dime out of pocket.

Im looking to trade this item. What I'm looking for are any FOID items really.  I would really like a 12g shotgun or an AR-15 but anything will be considered.  I would also consider a really nice compound bow. Got something lying around that you haven't shot in a while? Lemme know and hopefully we can work something out.

This is from Glock's website: GLOCK introduced the G22 .40 in 1990 and effectively closed the gap between the heavy .45 Auto, and the internationally proven 9x19. GLOCK was the first manufacturer to make this popular and effective round accessible for law enforcement agencies. Today, police agencies across the U.S., and countless others throughout the world, put their trust in this pistol."

It has only 1100 miles on it and is in great shape. Runs and drives perfect. Everything works as it should. It is up to date on all maintenance and has been stored in a heated garage. I have the title and key. It is quiet, gets around 100 mpg, and is a blast to drive!!! What's not to love!!!

More details: The scooter has been completely checked over and inspected. All fluids have been changed. All routine maintenance has been done correctly and timely. Tires look good, brakes are strong, engine purrs like a kitten, has a newer battery, new spark plug. Its ready to ride!!! It has a very loud horn, gas indicator, very bright headlight and taillight as well as turn signals. Locking center stand and handlebars and has a compartment in the seat that can fit a helmet, book bag, clothes etc... It has a big comfy seat, nice clear controls and has the weight low for better stability. And the best part is its a 4 stroke which requires no 2 stroke oil or gas mixing!!! It uses the same engine and drive train as the honda ruckus... a very reliable and common platform. It has the styling of a vespa, but with a lower price tag and better reliability. Tops out around 40 mph. 

The ideal owner would be someone looking for a great scooter to get around town super cheaply, a college student for campus, someone getting into motorcycles, or someone who just likes cruising around on the weekends. 

Im not in a rush to sell, I enjoy owning it and its a pleasure to ride but I have other toys so this needs to go eventually.

I would be willing to negotiate somewhat if you come and see it and have cash in hand. You won't be disappointed, this is a great buy.

Please feel free to contact me through email if you have any questions, would like more pictures, or would like to take a look at it.

These guns sell for $900 and are very accurate and reliable used by our special forces. 


The HK USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) is the first service pistol based on a modular concept. During development of the USP, the requirements of the Military and Security forces have consistently been taken into consideration. Thanks to the use of an improved Browning locking system with a patented buffer system, the USP recoil behaviour is unobtrusive even during the use of the highest powered ammunition. The buffer system reduces recoil forces and increases both service life of the pistol as well as improves recoil behaviour. The modular design of the USP enables an individual adaptation of safety and trigger mechanisms to any requirement.

A recent review of this firearm is listed below!

Zastava Arms is a Serbian manufacturer of firearms and artillery. It was founded in 1853 when it cast its first cannons. It is currently the leading producer of firearms in Serbia and is a large contributor to the local defence industry. Zastava Arms produces and exports a wide variety of products to over forty countries.
Reviewed By: Randall F on 05/26/2008 Rating: [5 of 5 Stars!]

 EAA has begun importing pistols from Zastava firearms in Serbia; I?m sure you have seen their ads in the gun magazines more notable for ?Heather? the leggy blonde model than for the firearms. In the ads the Model 88 appears to be nothing more than a copy of the Russian Tokarev T-33, nothing to get excited about and I always spent more time gazing at Heather without giving the pistol any further thought. According to the 4th Edition of ?Pistols of the World? Zastava was founded in 1900 with help from Fabrique Nationale of Belgium. In their 108 years of existence they have manufactured one revolver and six semi-automatic pistols. Three of the pistols were direct copies of the Tokarev and only two of the six pistols are still being manufactured the Model 88 which I?ll call the ?Baby Tokarev? and a cut-rate copy of the classic SIG design.



 When I stumbled upon the M88 I was immediately struck by two things: the quality of the finish and how small the pistol was. To give you some idea of size, it is about as big and the Colt Pocket Hammerless model 1903 and 1908 models. Interestingly enough the Browning-Colt designs were what the Russians were copying when they produced the Tokarev. It has the same barrel link as the Colt 1911 and the same barrel bushing as the first Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless pistols.



 I had to stand on my tippy toes to see the price tag and was shocked to see that it was less than two and a half. I became recklessly curious to see if it actually worked. The model 88 holds 8 + 1 rounds of 9mm, weighs 28 ounces, is 7 inches long with a three inch barrel, stands 6 inches tall and at the widest point, which is the grips, is 1.25 inches wide. The slide and grip frame width is .8 inches wide. 

In handling the pistol a lot of what I saw and felt caused me to remind myself that it was an inexpensive pistol, you can?t expect much. Two things that didn?t fit that expectation were the blacked finish and the accuracy at 21 feet which, due to running out of ammo, was all I could shoot yesterday. The handling qualities of the pistol were rather rough; but for this money you don?t expect a silky-smooth fit in terms of slide to frame and magazine extraction. This is a single action pistol that would be carried cocked and locked, however, the trigger pull is nothing like you are going to find on most other Single Actions. It is stiff; I don?t have a trigger pull gauge (yet) but I would guess that the pull is over 10 pounds. There is a slight amount of take up before you engage the stiff pull. Actually I am not totally unhappy with this since I intend to carry this as soon as I am comfortable with its performance and all too often a light trigger pull becomes a nightmare in criminal or civil court; no one is going to accuse you of having a hair trigger on this pistol. 

The sights have three dots on the barely utilitarian Tokarev type front blade and rear ?u? notch. The three dots seem to be almost an afterthought; the dot is so small I could not see it in indoor range lighting. I have since built up the front sight with some orange sight paint. 

The rear notch is shallow which is not all that bad since the pistol, at 21 feet, seemed to be fairly well regulated. The notch needs to be wider and I will take a file to it as soon as I remember who I lent my metal files to. 

I only had time and ammo enough to put 81 rounds through it and at least one round failed to properly feed in each magazine for the first several magazines. That began to clear up toward the end and I have to take into consideration that one, I was shooting the pistol dry right out of the box and two, even thousand dollar Kimber and Springfields require a lengthy shoot-in period. I anxiously await next weekend to see if the FTFs work themselves out of the pistol.

 As I mentioned earlier the finish was better than expected and so was the short range accuracy:

 These two targets were fired at from 21 feet with Remington 115 grain FMJ ammo. The target on the right was the first target shot out of the box and the one on the left was the second target.



 The target on the left was shot with Remington 115 grain JHP ammo and the target of the right was a mixed magazine with 3 Speer Gold Dot 115 grain hollow points and 3 Corbon 114 grain +P hollowpoints. The Corbons hit at 2, 6, and 11 O?clock. None of these rounds failed to feed.


 This pistol certainly is not going to win raves at the next BBQ but for someone on a limited budget this could provide them with basic protection. Another plus, God forbid, would be that if you were faced with having to shoot someone, you would not fret much about having to turn it over to the police like you would if it were your thousand dollar Kimber or Springfield status pistol."

Well here's your chance!  A nice example of the famed M1 Garand. 

This M1 Garand receiver was made in December of 1944, and rebarreled in 1947. Many WWII parts on this rifle, including a round-top gas piston nut, a -7 hammer, an 11-marked follower, milled trigger guard, a narrow-base gas piston, and a reproduction single-slot gas piston screw.  The stock is a Danish-manufactured return, with the original tag still in the inside groove.  The barrel is in ""Rack Grade"" condition according to CMP standards, this was a Danish return barreled receiver originally.  Some pitting where the upper handguard meets the face of the receiver, but nothing active and nothing that will affect functionality.  

For an additional $100, I'll include a real-deal WWII bayonet, GI web sling, and a well-used USGI walnut stock in case you'd like to replace the birch one currently on it.  The bayonet is a very nice AFH 10 inch with the original finish and NO Greek return markings. Even better, one of the grips is an early brown bakelite, the opposite being the black bakelite usually seen on these.  Scabbard is a post-war manufacture (not a repro) with ""US M7"" on the front.  Sling is a standard post-war OD web sling, not the leather one shown in the picture.  

I will include one box of USGI Lake City manufactured .30-06 ammunition and two Garand clips as well.

Asking $750 for just the rifle or $850 for the set. May also consider trade for a quality colonial flintlock fowler or rifle, or a Springfield XD45 plus cash.  Call Casey at REDACTED, or email for more pictures.  This is an out-of-state area code, but I'm stationed here with the military, and thus legal to deal face-to-face per ATF regs.
