Kimber rimfire pistols and conversion kits have adjustable, dovetail-mounted sights with steel-on-steel click adjustments. Standard features include match grade barrel and chamber. Slides and frames are aluminum for light weight.
Kimber rimfire pistols have the same features and unequaled performance as Kimber centerfires. Adjustable sight, bumped beavertail grip safety and extended thumb safety are standard. Aluminum slides and frames make rimfire pistols exceptionally light â ideal for young shooters. Conversion kits work with all Kimber.45 ACP pistols that have either 4 or 5-inch barrels and single stack magazines. They also fit most brands of 1911 pistols, provided they are mil-spec, single stack, and do not have a ramped barrel.

All Kimber pistols in centerfire calibers have a Loaded Chamber Indicator Port.â¢ When a round is chambered and light is available, the shell casing should be visible through the slot at the rear of the barrel hood. 

All slides and frames are paired in the early stages of production and travel through the factory together, ensuring optimum fitting of every part. This is one reason Kimber pistols have unequaled performance and dependability. 

Custom features like high ride beavertail grip safety, extended thumb safety and Commander-style hammer are part of every Kimber pistol. All parts are made inside the Kimber factory, ensuring quality control. 

The Kimber Custom sets the performance standard for production 1911 pistols. 
Models are offered with a choice of fixed, adjustable or night sights, and in 
matte or polished finishes. Both carbon steel and stainless steel versions are available. Common features include the Kimber Firing Pin Safetyâ¢, designated by âIIâ in the model name, along with rounded and blended edges for comfortable carry.

The Stainless TLE II .45 ACP is a stainless steel version of the duty pistol carried by LAPD SWAT. Important upgrades from the Kimber Custom Shop like MeprolightÂ® night sights and 30 lines-per-inch checkering on the front strap are also included. Based on the Kimber Stainless II, it has standard features like match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid stainless steel for additional resistance to the elements. A 1911 fi ts almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4â5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the authority of the great .45 ACP cartridge, the Stainless TLE II is an all-around top choice for duty, concealed carry or personal defense.

    3-dot (green) Meprolight night sights.
    Slide and frame machined from solid stainless steel.
    Extended beveled magazine well for quick and positive loading.

The round count is under 400, I ended up customizing the gun more than I actually got to take it out.  Looking for $400 OBO for everything.

Here is the setup for sale:

- Ruger MkIII Blued 5.5"" Bull Barrel w/Adjustable Sights, original case and manual with a custom 1911 Hogue Grip installed (details on this below)
- Sight Rib installed
- Tasco Silver ProPoint Red Dot (some wear, glass is perfect)
- 3 Magazines
- McFadden Ultimate Cliploader
- Box of CCI Mini Mag (100)

Details on the grip:
The earlier series of the Ruger MkIII 22/45 had a molded grip that is just too thin and uncomfortable (anyone that has these knows what I'm talking about), and there was no way to use aftermarket grips.  

People have tmade aftermarket grips in the following ways:

1. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRkiSlXdrKM) which require drilling into the frame, or

2. http://www.perfectunion.com/vb/guns-guns-guns/68671-ruger-22-45-modded.html, techniques that require milling and grinding the frame down to accept standard 1911 grips.  

I wanted to do neither, so looking at the various techniques I was able to fabricate a Hogue 1911 wrap around grip (modifying the grip, not the gun), and adhering it with industrial strength silicone adhesive.  It works perfectly, preserves the original gun, and feels as these grips would on a 1911, so this is somewhat unique and a process figured out DIY.  The feel, grip angle and recoil reduction (what little there is to begin with) is excellent.  I personally felt Hogue slip over grips felt terrible and affected the balance and grip angle substantially.  Obviously this will be a matter of preference, but they are easily removed.  

To remove the grip, all it takes is peeling the grip off (with some substantial effort), and rubbing away, brushing out with a cleaning brush the silicone that remains, and restoring the gun back to original factory grip.  

So this is a very unique setup, and it was my primary target pistol until I upgraded to a true 1911 22 dedicated setup.

""Take Your Pistolcraft to the Next Level with the SIRT Dry Fire Training Pistol 
While NLT knows that dry fire training is no substitute for live fire training, neither is there a need to rely on it exclusively thanks to the Shot Indicating Resetting Trigger (SIRT) Training Pistol and the exclusive laser feedback mechanism. Designed to complement, not replace, live fire training, the SIRT Dry Fire Training Pistol brings together a host of patent pending technologies critical to improving shooting accuracy while addressing issues of cost and liability.

Safe, effective, and innovative, the SIRT Dry Fire Training Pistol was developed by shooters for shooters. We understand the unique training demands and restrictions faced by todayâs law enforcement professionals.

Built tough with sturdy steel construction, the SIRT Dry Fire Training Pistol looks and feels like the real thing by matching the size, weight, and center of gravity of the officerâs live fire pistol. In addition, the SIRT Dry Fire Training Pistol even offers a host of customizable features including mag cartridge changes and replaceable sights.

Unlike a standard live fire or Air Soft pistol, the SIRT Dry Fire Training Pistol provides instantaneous performance feedback and no need for ongoing expenditures such as ammo and targets through laser feedback. Because of its flexibility and cost-effectiveness, the SIRT doesnât just permit additional training â it encourages it.

Simple to use, the SIRT Dry Fire Training Pistol is applicable to a range of training exercises including shooting accuracy, sidearm handling, integrated cardio and live course programs, and even force-on-force training scenarios. Because it does not discharge any type of projectile and instead uses laser feedback, the SIRT Dry Fire Training Pistol can be used safely in nearly every environment and situation."""

Solid and built to last! 
, 03/29/2010 
5 out of 5 I bought these because I needed a pair of solid boots for doing tough work.From past experience, J.J. Industrial Work Gear is built to take a beating, and look good at the same time. These boots also met those expectations and are holding up very well. Nice and solid feeling, with a steel toe. Laces and loops are strong and allow for you to really crank down when you tie them.For 50 bucks, they are well worth it, and build to last!

I had this pistol for about 3 years and shot about 300 flawless rounds at the range. Feels great in my hand due to the ergonomics of the grips that have been improved by interchangeable back straps and side panel inserts. Ambidextrous operating controls, makes this pistol individually adapted to almost any user. No compromises have been made regarding safety. The P30 V3 has a traditional double action/single action trigger system with a decocking button at the rear of the slide and a firing pin block safety that eliminate the need for a manual safety. Another feature is the Super Luminova 3-dot sights with non-tritium luminous dots, allowing an exact target acquisition even under poor lighting conditions."

I bought this gun as an investment but reconsidered and now I would rather use the money to continue adding onto my AR15's. I paid 699.99 plus tax so around 740.00 out the door. I listed a description below of the colt MK IV gun from a website I found. I can send as many pictures are you would like to an email.

Also, I had the store send the gun out to colt to check for functionality and safety. It just came back on 10/9/11 in perfect working order.

Description 


This Colt Mk IV Series 80 Government Model was manufactured in 1984 according to the company records. It is a self-loading, recoil operated, semi-automatic pistol that is chambered for the .380 ACP cartridge. The pistol has been designed to operate as a single action firearm that utilizes an external hammer and a locked breech. The Patridge sights includes a blade front sight and a square notch rear sight that is drift adjustable for windage only. The Mk IV is fed by a single column 7 round detachable box magazine. The pistol utilizes a push button magazine release located on the left side of the receiver in front of the grip. The manual thumb safety is located behind the left grip and must be in the fire position before the slide is allowed to move rearward. The pistol has a 3 1/4 inch barrel and an overall length of 6.15 inches and an unloaded weight of 21 3/4 ounces. This firearm does employ a slide hold open mechanism to inform the operator that the last round has been fired. The finish is a deep Colt blue. The checkered grip panels are a cream colored plastic and sport a gold Colt logo with the famous rampant Colt symbol in the middle of each grip. The trigger and recoil spring guide are made of plastic.

The Colt Mk IV Series 80 Government Model chambered in .380 ACP caliber was in production from 1984 to 1997.

The .380 Automatic Colt Pistol cartridge has a bullet diameter of .355 inches and was first introduced by Colt in 1908. It is also known as the 9mm Short, 9mm Browning, 9mm Kurz, 9mm Corto and 9x17mm.  The cartridge was originally designed for the early blowback pistols that lacked a barrel locking mechanism commonly known as a locked breech design. The .380 ACP round travels at a rate of about 1000 feet per second and with a 90 to 95 grain projectile, it can deliver between 200 and 205 foot pounds of energy at the muzzle. For comparison, a .38 special round travels at a rate of around 980 feet per second and with a 110 grain projectile it can produce around 235 foot pounds of muzzle energy. Which makes the .38 special slightly more powerful than the .380 ACP round."

Its a compact model which could be used for a youth for a little older youth.  I am 5'10'' and it fits me perfect the barrel is shorter but the stock is more of a normal size, if your not sure of what  the compact model is, I have found a bunch of information about it on line.. I was using it to hunt pigs but have decided that I would like to have a semi auto in 223. The pick below is generic but the gun is identical. It is topped with a simmons scope that is a 50mm. This is an awsome shooting rifle and I hate to see it go but im always looking to swap firearms to meet my current needs.  If interested please feel free to contact me at REDACTED.

This is the ""enhanced"" version, with a fully engraved receiver and floorplate, a checkered bolt handle, a beautiful glossy checkered wood stock with white accents, and a fully jeweled bolt.  It's topped off with a camoflage pattern Remington padded sling on quick-release swivels.

But it's not just pretty -- the .338 RUM round is a monster, and this thing is ready to launch 'em.  It takes three rounds in the magazine with one in the chamber.  It has a hooded front blade sight and an adjustable rear sight, but the receiver is also tapped at the factory for scope rings to make it easy to mount your choice of glass.  Despite its size, it's fairly light.  The floorplate is hinged and the bolt is fully removable for easy cleaning.

I personally have never fired this weapon -- it is part of a collection I purchased from a retiring soldier.  He fired it seldom and cleaned it meticulously as you will see.  I can find one scratch on the stock, but the metal is in perfect shape, the bore is bright and sharp and even the magazine follower is barely worn.

With the weapon, I will include 40 rounds of loaded ammo, a set of Lyman dies for this caliber, 50 new brass casings, and 48 bullets of two different types.


All this can be yours for $750!

In fact I would guess it's relatively new, or at least has been handled gently and not shot too much.  It has been modified somewhat, most obviously it has a wood handguard (Universal typically installed a metal one) and it has been fitted with a bayonet lug.  The light-colored wood stock does show some wear, but it is still presentable and of course serviceable.  The letters ""W - R"" are engraved on the underside of the trigger guard, but aside from that the metal finish is in good shape.

It comes with a GI-style OD green web sling and oiler, as well as an M8A1 GI bayonet and sheath in excellent condition, two 20-round GI magazines and three 30-round magazines, two of which are apparently GI, and one I'm not sure.

The gun and accessories are worth $500



For this gun, I also have:
Â· 602 rounds of loaded ammo for it, 99 of which are new Aguila and the rest are reloads of various types
Â· 369 shell casings that appear to be new, about 1/3 of which are nickel and the rest brass
Â· 821 of two different types of bullets
Â· a set of Lee .30 Carbine dies

New ammo in this caliber goes for around 50Â¢/round, so I'd sell the reloads for half that, $175 for all 600+ rounds; the dies are worth $20, the brass about $80, and the bullets about $107.  Feel free to pick and choose as suits you, but I will not sell the ammo or components until the gun is sold and its buyer has a chance at the ammo."

The tooling and design were later sold to the United Arab Republic (Egypt), and the Hakim was produced there during the 1950's and 60's.

It also has a standard steel AR butt-plate with built in loop for single point sling (would make a great winter ccw. haha) It has a Hogue, rubber, finger-groove pistol grip that is much more comfortable that the standard grips. 
This pistol has little to no recoil and you can stay on target for quick follow up shots. It has built in sights and even a rail for whatever optic you may desire.
It comes with 5 C-products steel magazines. Four are 32-round and one is 20-round. These mags are $40+ a piece if you were going to buy them and they will never break like the cheap plastic ones do.

The guy I purchased it from was the original buyer. I was told it has never been cocked with the cylinder locked in and again from what I can tell this is also the truth again i have not done it while I have owned it. It has the slightest cylinder turn line if you look extremely close in places but this could have been done at the factory. It is in perfect condition beautiful finish no marks at all.

Looking to sell my Browning BPS 12 gauge. This is not the ordinary black BPS. This one has a very elaborate engraving on both sides of the receiver, and it also has a gorgeous figured walnut stock. It has a 26"" barrel, and I had a Limbsaver recoil pad professionally installed. I've shot less than 400 rounds through it. It is in perfect working order, and cosmetically it is practically flawless. It does have a few really faint tarnish markings on the receiver (I tried to capture those in one of the pictures). I've only taken this out for a few rounds of sporting clays on nice sunny days. Otherwise it has been sitting in the case at home.

It will come with 3 Invector choke tubes, orignal box, original recoil pad, 2 snap caps, a Bore Snake cleaning tool, and the Redhead soft case you see in the picture. I'm looking for $550 for a local sale (Kansas), or add shipping and FFL fees for non local sale. 

Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

It's been said that a long gun without a sling is like a handgun without a holster. We strongly believe that to be a true statement. But, not all slings are created equal. Our CQB 3 Point Tactical Slings are simple, versatile, durable, and affordable. The 3 point sling design is nothing new. However, we've refined the design to deliver a truly functional sling which works. 

All of our CQB Tactical Slings are made from heavy duty 1.25"" wide nylon webbing which is durable, yet comfortable, and doesn't abrade the skin or generate a noise signature. We use only the best quality hardware and hook and loop fasteners. All of our slings are sewn by skilled technicians on industrial machines using heavy duty nylon thread with all stress points reinforced for maximum durability.

This sling is designed to fit Benelli M1, M2 & M3 tactical shotguns with front side sling mounts. This sling utilizes your existing rear sling loop via a sliding rear attachment strap and utilizes your front side sling mount for forward attachment.

These slings are 1.25"" wide, fully ambidextrous and available with an Emergency Release Buckle (ERB).

Emergency Release Buckle (ERB) Option

The Emergency Release Buckle (ERB) option is available for all of our Tactical Slings.

Details: I am the only/original owner of this rifle. I bought it for the upcoming hunting season but I am just going to use my fathers rifle. This rifle has not even seen a full box of shells (only 15 rounds of Remington to be exact.) I will include 25 rounds of Remington 165gr Core-Lokt ammo and about 70 pieces of unprepared brass (mostly Winchester). Looking to keep this as one package right now. This is a perfect package for the upcoming season.

846,http://www.armslist.com/posts/208846,For Sale:  1977 Cadillac Coupe DeVille,"New Albany, southern IN., Indiana, United States","$ 3,299","Listed On: Wednesday, January 18, 2012",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is not just some 35 year old car thats been sitting in a garage uncared for.  I have put over $4500 in this classic beauty in the last three years I have owned it.  This Coupe has over $3000 in body and paint work that I had done as soon as I purchased the car.  I am not new to Cadillacs nor older large frame cars and I purchased this car vecause the 424 cubic inch big block engine ran outstanding and the frame was rock solid.  The Landau or mock convertible top was totally ratted out when I purchased the car.  The biggest problem cosmeticly was where the top met the body rust had began to rat holes clear through.  When I took the Cadillac to Spray Shop Customs the body shop owner explained that for around $1700 he could use body filler and Bondo on the rust and it would look good for a few years.  Or if I intended on keeping the car he could do it the right way which meant cutting out any rusty areas, welding in new metal, sanding it smooth and then paint for a permanent repair. I opted for the job done correctly.  The top is new.

The transmission was replaced with brand new last year to the tune of $1000 at Tuckers in Clarksville.  This tranny shop has a great reputation for good work.  The title says 167,000 miles thats saying the odometer rolled at some point.  I believe this is a mistake and someone who titled the car before me made the assumption that the odometer had rolled over so thats what it says on title.  My point is that the engine doesnt leek oil, and runs too well for that many miles.  The interior is kind of rough as I hadnt got to that yet.  The a/c and heat need work because when you kick them on the belt squeels.  The car needs some minor things like that, but is ready to drive anywhere.
THE PRICE IS OBO
I will be taking a pretty big hit on this car at this price, but I know times are tight and I am pricing it to sell.  I may take partial trades on firearms, but dont offer me another car.  I drive a Volvo wagon as my daily driver, this has been my cruising on Sunday ride."

Just to be clear, you cant buy a WW1 M91 in this condition out of a crate at a gun show or surplus dealer anymore. An M91 rifle in this condition out of a crate no longer exsists.

I'll even throw in the holster for free if you would like I just bought it a couple months ago and I recently decided to take up competition shooting. For that I would need something that is built for that. This gun is great! It feels very comfortable in your hand along with having a good weight so as to tame the recoil. 

This is an excellent handgun. It's very comfortable to grip and shoot and can easily be concealed. I've only fired 100 rounds through it and don't plan on using it again. It has great iron sights and the over all curvature of the entire gun is very sleek. 

[Please note I will only deal locally. This is for security reasons seeing that I have no way of knowing if buyers will come through with payment and steal my firearm. If you have a solution to this please let me know. Thank you.]

I would like to get $450 out of it but I am willing to come down a bit on the price.
