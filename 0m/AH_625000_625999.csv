If you have some of these oldies laying around that you no longer use and would like to convert to cash, shoot me a reply with what you have & your price and I'll get back to you. Be prepared to eventually provide detailed photos before I will commit to any deal. 

I'd prefer FTF transactions in Charlotte area. If you can't do FTF and must ship them, then we can discuss that when you contact me. Obviously, the cost of shipping these days is too high for me to cover the cost of shipping one or two magazines.

This is the last rifle built by Michael Gorchinski before his tragic death in the 1983 bombing of the Marine Corp barracks in Beirut. 
I only shot one 1000 yard match which yielded a score of 187/200.
I also used this rifle to win the California All Guard Championship around 1988. 
Rifle is currently sporting a lugless Springfield muzzle brake to make it California legal, but the original flash hider is included, along with three magazines.

This load is chambered for 30-30 Winchester and uses a 55gr bullet in a plastic sabot.  The bullet moves at around 3,400 fps.  This round shoots great, and is perfect for varmints from your deer hunting rifle.  These need to loaded one at a time if your rifle has a tube magazine (as most 30-30's are).

This ammo is no longer made and is out of stock at the normal channels (Midway, Cheaper Than Dirt, etc), but when they had them they sold for $30 per box.  I have two boxes for sale.  One of the boxes has the full 20 rounds, the other has 16 rounds."

Those characteristics provide a unique kind of satisfaction. It's not as pretty as it once was, with its bluing worn away on the barrel, and its rusty pits and such. But it shoots great and you can count on it to continue doing so. Solid and tight, with new Hogue rubber and the original wood grips if you want 'em.

Sig Sauer P226 Navy 9mm E26R-9-NSWG
The SIG SAUER P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIGs entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 Navy is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet's special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

***I will listen to offers when you have looked at the truck and a show genuine interest***

Reason:
Bought a new car, no need for the truck anymore. Purchased as a winter vehicle but needs some things.

4x4 needs transfer case to be replaced to operate 100%, part is 231D and 272 Ratio as the mechanic put it. 4x4 is working but very rough shape due to the current transfer case being completely worn out.
Driver side door does not currently open to the full length, the fender needs to be removed and bent back into shape to allow the door to pass through. Still works just fine!

Truck is mechanically sound and very reliable so far, newer tires will last winter and another year,

All parts for this gun are interchangeable with the ""Mossberg 500"" except the trigger assembly. That is because the ""Mossberg 500"" has a tang safety which is located on top of the receiver while this gun has a cross bolt safety located at the front of the trigger guard.

I have a good running 1998 Buick Riviera. Has 3.8 super charged motor, leather seats, climate control, pretty loaded. I bought it with about 115k miles. I use it to drive from Junction City to Salina everyday for the past year or so. It's a great and reliable running car just not driving it anymore so time to go. Here is a list of things it has and things that have been replaced/added. New Hankook tires (about 30k miles on them and are 80k mile tires), spark plugs, wires, one  coil,  belts, all wheel bearings and speed sensors, brakes, k & n air filter, tinted windows, all new ac, all new blend door actuators, transmission motor mount, new interstate battery, valve cover gaskets, new driver side door handle, changed super charger oil, oil changed every 5k miles with full synthetic amsoil, and tires rotated every 5k miles. Has Kenwood DNX-9980HD In-Dash GPS Navigation Receiver in dash unit that can play movies, and hook up to your phone with usb port with a 7inch screen. It also has Garmin gps. Really nice unit. Also has rear back up camera.  Also have it by passed that you can watch movies with out the car having to be in park. Also set up so the steering wheel controls to run the head unit. Unit also has Bluetooth with mic. Car now has 154k miles. 

Here are the bad on the car. Check engine light is on. Has been on since I got the car and have never had it break down on me. There is a dent above the driver side rear tire. Driver window is not rolling down and the driver seat back panel fell off.  No spare tire. (wasn't there when I got it)

It's a pretty nice car that has great ac and heating. Rides smooth and will get up and go when the time calls for it. I usually get about 24 to 28 mpg depending how I'm driving. Just drove from JC to Salina to KC then back to JC and still have a little under 1/4 tank of gas. Have gotten 30mpg when doing about 65mph and at 80mph more towards the 25mpg. Has a large gas tank and can go about 340 to 400 miles on it. The 3.8 is a bullet proof motor and wouldn't be afraid to drive this car any where.  
Asking $2800 obo. Have title in hand.   

Would also consider partial trade for guns   
Can email or text anytime REDACTED can call between 8am and 10pm leave message if no answer and I'll get back to you. Car is located in Junction City but can bring to Salina or Manhattan since I go to both places quit often. Thanks!"

It too was a blowback operated pistol chambered for the 7.65mm Browning.  It was larger than the earlier models, being of the size for which a holster might be  deemed necessary, but the longer grips and barrel improved the pistol's handling and pointing characteristics.  The Model 4  was the first Walther pistol to achieve notable commercial success, and many were used by police agencies as well as the German military during World War One.  The pistol has an elongated barrel bushing which serves the same purpose as that on the earlier pistols, but in addition, also carries the front sight.  Model 4's were manufactured between 1910 and 1918.  The Model 4 was 6"" long and weighed about 18.5 ounces.  Magazine capacity was eight rounds.

 Benjamin®'s hunting PCP pistol incorporates all the features that make the Marauder and Discovery exceptional air rifles. An excellent choice for hunting, the new Benjamin® Marauder .22 caliber PCP pistol is ultra-quiet and, with practice is more than accurate enough to easily take out small game from up to 33 yards away at velocities up to 700 fps. 

The improved trigger on the Marauder pistol is accomplished by redesigning the grip frame from our popular 2240 series of guns and adding an adjustable, two-stage, drop sear trigger utilizing precision heat treated metal components. The mechanism is designed and built with the same materials and precision as the very popular Marauder rifle trigger group. 

This pistol provides all the strength and accuracy required for small game hunting. The Marauder PCP Pistol features a self-indexing, 8-shot clip and a 12-inch choked and shrouded barrel (scope not included). Overall length of the pistol is 18-inches (pistol grip configuration). It comes equipped with a stock extension to shoulder mount the gun, a handy feature in the field, and with 3000 psi of compressed air, this gun has the muscle to quietly and dependably get the job done
