The factory hammer was known to cause uneven wear on the bolt in these rifles and they also suffered from trigger slap, so this is and incredibly important upgrade on the SAR3. The original FSB was replaced with an original Romanian threaded 22mm front sight base and a US-made copy of the Romanian muzzlebrake by AK-USA. All parts were installed by Troy at InRange in Kodak, Tennessee. Troy installed everything and then parkerized and painted the rifle. I don't think anyone interested in AKs can question the high quality of Troy's work. The finish is smooth, even, and looks phenomenal, especially compared to other AKs. The muzzlebrake and FSB are fully functional as designed (plunger and spring to lock the brake in place upon tightening) and the muzzlebrake is fully removable. The furniture is laminated wood from Russia with the exception of the laminated repo handgrip which is US made. The furniture was professionally refinished with an authentic Russian look, Includes two 30 round waffle mags."

I tested this ammunition in a colt LE AR with true M4 feed ramps, and multiple mags. It offered perfect function in all of them. There isn't really much to say here.

From the manufacturer:
ECONOMIC RELIABILITY. Blazer® Brass brings shooters the reliability and quality of ammunition built to SAAMI standards, and is backed by stringent ISO certified quality systems. Blazer Brass is loaded in reloadable brass cases for added value. Standard Boxer-type primers and primer pockets mean you can reload Blazer Brass cases just like any other case. Blazer Brass is loaded with a protected-base FMJ bullet. CCI® primers insure reliable ignition, and we load clean-burning propellants. Blazer Brass loads are very similar to Speer Lawman ammunition. It is produced in CCI's production facility in Lewiston, Idaho along the banks of the Snake river. The CCI plant which produces several brands (CCI, Blazer, Blazer Brass, and Speer) is owned by ATK (the same company that owns Federal)."

For Sale:
Fully functional
These (2) are Belgium hand crafted replicas of George Washington's flint lock dueling pistols. All authenticity paperwork is included. They are silver inlaid with golden barrels made in England. 
 Not many of these were made, the only other set I have ever heard about were sold by a Gen. in Fort Brag for close to $5,000 about 5 years ago. These were left to me by my grandfather which he purchased from the factory in 1975. They have never been fired (other than the test fire from the factory). I am selling them well under fair market value in hopes to sell them quickly. My grandfather paid $3,000 back in '75 and I am hopping to get $4,000 but will consider other offers.
If you would like any information regarding these pistols, please let me know. They have been appraised for much more than what I am selling them for. I again, need to sell now."

I have two new BX-25 magazines and a factory coupler. I am looking to trade for the following. Glock 17 17rd, Glock 17 33rd, AR-15 30rd, M&P 15-22 25 rd magazines. 

Here is the deal, do not email me asking to trade a AR-15 GI magazine for one of the BX-25. We all know things are out of whack price wise so be reasonable in what you are asking to trade. If not I could just simply pop these on Ebay, GunBroker, etc and get top dollar for them anyway.

Reasonable trade offers only all other will be ignored.

I will sell these but strongly prefer to trade. I will sell both magazines and the coupler as a set ONLY for $150.00

OK FOLKS, I AM GETTING PLENTY OF ACTION ON THIS LISTING BUT DO NOT EMAIL ME ASKING TO TRADE ONE PMAG FOR ONE BX-25 MAG. No thanks. Even looking at ""regular"" pricing before the maddness the Pmags were $12 to $15 and the BX-25 were $25.00. So even using the ""regular pricing I would do a 2 for one at best. To be honest I have plenty of Pmags and would rather get a better ""value"" out of my trade doing a trade for some nice GI mags."

|-Charging Handle
|-16"" 4140 Chrome Moly 300 AAC Blackout Barrel
|-Pistol Gas Tube
|-Low Profile Gas Block

|-Free Float Picatinny Quad Rail

This system was developed to launch 30 caliber projectiles from the AR platform without a reduction in magazine capacity and compatible with the standard bolt.

Full power 115-125 grain ammunition matches the ballistics of the 7.62x39mm AK, and eclipses 5.56mm with much higher-mass projectiles for a more dramatic effect on the target. Or choose subsonic cartridges for optimal use with a sound suppressor - 220 grain Sierra OTM (open-tip match) bullets vastly outperforms a 9mm MP5-SD in penetration and long range accuracy.
At 300 meters, 300 BLK has 16.7% more energy than 7.62x39mm. Max effective range, using M4 military standards for hit probability, is 440 meters for a 9 inch barrel, and 460 meters for a 16 inch barrel. 300 BLK from a 9 inch barrel has the same energy at the muzzle as a 14.5 inch barrel M4, and about 5% more energy at 440 meters - even though the barrel is much shorter.

For hunting - think of it as like a 30-30 but from an AR. After you are done, you can remove your 5-round magazine and put in a 30 for plinking or home defense. For ammo, Remington has you covered with the Premiere AccuTip 125 grain. Want industry-wide support? Over 60 companies have already announced or sell products.
