Jealous of your other shooting buddies?

Why pay more for practically the same product?

With all the proper tools and equipment, we can build your standard AR15 carbine (or HBAR rifle) for as low as $640!!!

These are kit builds on Double Star lowers. Our parts supplier uses quality brands. Not only are my builds checked for proper head space by the supplier AND the assembler, but every build is test fired 30 rounds and include a LOADED 30 round magazine! 

We are currently in the process of moving and building a new facility, but we are still building AR15s at full speed! With the new facility, we will be able to ship builds to any FFL, but until then all sales will have to be face to face, private party to private party only!

We require a non refundable deposit for the parts only, and most builds are ready within 3-5 business days.

Look us up on Facebook under Legar Assembly ($640 build may or may not be listed), or simply email me for more information."

North Haven, CT    In the world of competitive shooting, the name Jerry Miculek is synonymous with record-breaking success.

A highly-accomplished shooter and five-time USPSA 3-Gun National Championship winner, Miculek depends on his equipment to reliably-deliver when fractions of seconds count.

Now you can shoot the same shotgun that this legendary champion uses as Mossberg proudly announces the JM Pro Series 930 Tactical Class of signature shotguns.

Initial offerings in this series of competition-oriented autoloaders include 10-shot and 9-shot versions with many performance-enhancing features. Further distinguishing this signature series is the “JM Pro Series Tactical Class” logo laser-engraved on the receiver.

The versatile 930 platform features a dual gas-vent operating system which aids in recoil reduction and reduces stress and wear on operating parts. This 12 gauge semi-auto reliably handles 2 ¾ and 3-inch from low-brass target loads to hard-hitting magnum rounds. Standard features include Uni-Line™ stock and receiver design for instinctive eye/rib alignment; stock drop spacer system for customizing fit; drilled and tapped receiver; interchangeable ACCU-CHOKE™ system; durable black synthetic stock and forend; and matte blue metal finishes.

Performance-enhancing features on the JM Pro Series include Mossberg’s extended tactical bolt handle; forend cut to facilitate faster reloads; oversized safety button; orange magazine follower; and protective barrel clamp for the extended mag tube. The 10-Shot Tactical Class has a 24-inch, non-ported, vent rib barrel with standard ACCU-CHOKE Modified tube; red fiber optic front bead sight; extended 9-shot magazine tube; adjustable trigger stop; and anodized receiver with chamfered loading port opening. The 9-Shot Tactical Class version features a 22-inch, non-ported, vent rib barrel with standard ACCU-CHOKE Modified tube; red fiber optic front bead sight; extended 8-shot magazine tube; adjustable trigger stop; and anodized receiver with chamfered loading port opening.

Winning a national championship or setting a world record may not be in the cards for you. Looking like a champion and shooting the same gun that world-renown shooter, Jerry Miculek does is possible with the new Mossberg JM Pro Series 930 Signature Shotguns. Visit our web site at www.mossberg.com to see our complete line of high-performance shotguns.

G23 Gen 4: Test fire date is 2012, so it doesn't have the problems the earlier Gen 4s had. I put Meprolight Tru-Dot night sights on it (yellow/orange), and also bought 3 extra magazines (6 total). I have everything that came with the gun (box, lock, manual, warranty card which is not filled out, etc.). I also still have the original sights.  I have put approximately 200 rounds through it, no problems. It is still in like new condition, absolutely no scratches, scuffs or even minor blemishes.

G19 Gen 3: Has extended magazine release and extended slide release. Also has the stainless steel guide rod. I put TruGlo TFO night sights on it, but still have the originals.

G22 Gen 3: Only fired a few times. Has Meprolight night sights on it.

I am not interested in selling for cash at this time. I am mostly interested in trading for one of the items below, but I am open to suggestions (only modern guns). I will consider anything that is a step up from the Glocks. We can make up for any differences in value with cash, ammo, magazines, etc. Pretty flexible.

This is a 50th Anniversary model.  It is in pristine condition but has exactly 50 rounds fired through it to test reliability.  I bought it because I love the USP Compacts and the reliability/accuracy.  I wanted an original all German HK and something a bit more unique and special than just a regular USP Compact.  It was to be a bedside gun but I need to sell because I simply have collected too many now.

It has been converted to LEM (medium) so has a smooth and consistent trigger pull.  It is not overly light since I am more concerned about safety and real-world use.  All my HKs are LEM and if you have not tried it, you should.  It is similar to a Kahr trigger in concept...and a lot safer than a Glock trigger.  It can be converted back to DA/SA (or a light LEM) with just some part interchange.  I probably have all the original parts.

These go for around $1,000 - $1,200.  The LEM conversion was done by Bill Springfield- considered to be the best in the business.  That costs about $160.  Here is your chance to own a real German HK from 1999/2000.  It does have a high-gloss blued finish and has never been holstered or carried.  It comes in a wooden case with a HK badge/coin, and the wooden case can be locked with two golden keys.  There is also a cardboard HK case.

Can meet in the Littleton or DTC area.  Cash only.  No felons, and it must be legal for you to own a gun in Colorado.  CO Driver's License or CCW required for proof of residency.

I bought this rifle used, and it has functioned flawlessly for me.  I added an UTG quad rail, a Tapco 6 position stock, and a 3 point sling. Bore is rust free and bright.
The rifle originally came with a barrel thread adapter. It was held on with four Allen bolts and a spot weld.  I cut the spot weld and removed the adapter.  I bought a Tapco flash suppressor to replace it and realized the thread is smaller than normal 14 X 1 LH, hence the adapter that was on it.  I was going to re spot-weld the adapter or the new muzzle suppressor, but haven't done either.  The rifle will come with both, so you can decide. Rifle functions without either. 
Rifle comes with 30rd steel mag.

This started as a 59/66a1 Yugo SKS.  It was a shooter when I got her, however, I saw more potential.  This is how this project ran away ? -for nearly 6mo of building/trying/re-trying/buying/fitting, you get the point. 

Barrel was shortened to just over 16” (mind you this is done by a qualified gunsmith and a machinist).  End re-threaded to 14x1LH.   PWS muzzlebreak is chosen http://primaryweapons.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=57.  Gas selector is fine tuned by adding a gasket (no problems switching from semi to single shot or vice versa). Extra Stainless Steel Gas Valve is purchased http://www.milsurpstuff.com/proddetail.asp?prod=MSKSGV1 (included in the case).  Tapco furniture is dumped and replaced by an ATI folder set http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Professional-Aluminum-Upgrade-Package/dp/B003BRDAKQ.

Replacement receiver mount is tweaked to hold zero, however, eventually aluminum rail isn't reliable enough and a Choate Mount is mounted http://www.midwayusa.com/product/435151/choate-scope-mount-sks-steel-blue . Choate had to be drilled and tapped with/to 8/40 thread – done by a machinist again.  In the process ATI stock was modified to accept extra width of the Choate mount – that was done.  Choate does not have adequate slots to accept Firefield scope (it was designed for the weaver rings) – machine work is performed to slot Choate to accommodate Firefield scope/laser.  This is all in a Pelican 1720 case http://www.amazon.com/Pelican-1720-Case-Foam-Black/dp/B0014D68DK/ref=pd_sim_sbs_sg_5 .  Prince’s Paratrooper front sights were added and sighted, so Irons can be used http://www.assaultplanet.com/products/sks-accessories/ .  Murray firing pin with spring added to the bolt http://www.murraysguns.com/sksown.htm (extra spring included in the fancy case). 4 Tapco 5rd magazines (these are IMPOSSIBLE to find so I can’t even link it, but these do pop up on ebay for $40-50ish each) purchased.  5 Tapco 20rd black magazines purchased http://www.midwayusa.com/product/862913/tapco-magazine-sks-762x39mm-russian-20-round-polymer?cm_mmc=Froogle-_-Gunsmithing+-+Magazines+-+Rifle+-+11%2b+Rounds-_-PriceCompListing-_-862913 .

Broken shell extractor purchased and added to the case along with a shell deflector and front sight adjustment tool plus an interim scope mount with rings (while Choate was in transit)….

So when you see an ad that says ""Brand new Bushmaster with collapsible stock blah blah blah"" know that this is ILLEGAL. How adult men with these types of weapons don't know the New York State assault weapons ban law is beyond me. BE CAREFUL and know the law! On a new AR type rifle you MUST have a pinned stock, NOT A COLLAPSIBLE ONE, a muzzle brake and NOT a flash suppressor and you CANNOT have a bayonet lug. It must be removed.

Browning Buck Mark rimfire pistols lead the industry in quality, reliability, accuracy and variety. Every Buck Mark starts out as a solid piece of aircraft-grade 7075 aluminum alloy, and then is CNC machined to exacting tolerances. The crisp single-action trigger, hand reamed chamber, target crowned barrel and finely adjustable target sights mean the Buck Mark comes ready for fun straight from the box. The Ultragrip RX and Ultragrip DX represent the latest in grip technology. The finger grooves, laser stippling and stylish wave patterns combine to form an Ergonomic Interactive Surface (EIS) that puts your hand in the same place on the grip for every shot, resulting in more instinctual shooting and improved accuracy. The textured surfaces are comfortable and secure in any condition, while the narrow profile makes them perfect for all hand sizes"

WWII replacement Ithica slide, WWII Little mfg. magazine.  National match barrel and bushing, adjustable trigger. Barrel has been throated for semi wad cutterammo , as well as hardball ammo. Crisp 4# trigger. Triangle adjustable rear sight and National Match front sight. As most unit match pistols were, this one was built on an Essex frame. This allowed unit members to take their pistols with them when they were transfered to their next  duty station. Slide to frame fit is very tight.
 This is an extreamly accurate pistol. I shot it before I re-parkerized it.
 I re-polished the pins on the right side ....that's about as fancy as these pistols were ever made.
This kind of accurizing , etc would cost over $1500 to do today , plus the cost of the pistol.

Back when everyone thought that the pump action shotgun couldn't be improved, the Benelli Nova Pump proved otherwise. Completely original and innovative, the 12-gauge pump incorporates a polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics make the gun not only pleasing to look at, but a delight to hold and handle. Distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and forend in place of conventional checkering provides a positive gripping surface and complements the innovative engineering of the Nova Pump."

It has an unknown brand 3 prong style flash hider as well. If you want, it'll come with an old tasco 4x32 on quick dismount rings that I had sitting around, but show obvious wear, but the scope is still completely functional. 2 factory 7 round mags and 1 aftermarket 11 or 12 rounder. I was told by the previous owner it had less than 500 rounds through, and I've only personally put about 30 or so through it with no problems function wise, but the factory wood stock cracked, hence the new choate. the cracked stock and original buffer and spring are yours if you want them for whatever reason. These things are a blast to shoot and an awesome plinker for those who want a bit more pop than a 22.

I'm looking to trade it for a nicely built target 10/22 with a bull barrel and all the goodies, plus cash on top depending on the value of the 10/22. Preferably lightly used to like new. Let me know what you've got and what's been done to it and maybe we can make a deal.
