Grenade launcher and launcher sight removed, slant cut AKM-style muzzle brake permanently fixed to barrel (not threaded). Barrel shortened to 20"" and recrowned. Sight hood cut to AK profile. Tapco stock with bottom rail. Stock is dark earth and painted, but paint is easy to remove. Comes with Tapco buttstock and Magpul MOE buttstock, both of which fit. Accepts detachable, high-cap magazines. One STEEL 30 round magazine is included, and I have one other for sale for $40. Both magazines are just about brand new.

The rifle has the bolt modification so that the magazines can be removed or inserted when the bolt is closed. Bolt hold open tab is removed because it interfered with the magazines and caused jams, but can be replaced if you wish. It's a really cool rifle.

I have no idea how it shoots as I have never shot it, but the bore looks great. Do not expect the SKS to be a tack driver though. Very clean with smooth rifling. All metal parts are in nice condition."

The original grips are still on the gun which are great by the way and the gun has no holster wear on it, in fact it has never been in a holster. The owners’ manual and the gun case are still intact as is the original safety lock key and trigger adjustment key. As you know this gun is no longer in production by Springfield Armory so it's a little bit of a collector’s item already and will only be more so in the future. The only reason I am trying to sell/trade this 1911 is because I desire less mantenance weapon systems now."

Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize wel cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

The liberty at risk is so much greater than merely our individual rights to arms protected under the 2nd Amendment of the United States Constitution; no it is all of the cherished rights granted us under the entirety of the Bill of Rights.  The proposed legislation offered by liberal politicians, elected in regions of this country that clearly do not share in what I believe are the core values of the Midwestern states, and pushed forward under media blanket that is so despicable and devoid of any journalistic integrity as to be merely propaganda, is an effort to undermine the very fabric of our Constitution.

We cannot sit on the sidelines and hope that others will defend our liberties.  I have watched in disgust the attempts to paint the National Rifle Association and law abiding gun owners as the problem.  As a parent, I want to ensure the safety of our children, and abhor the senseless tragedy that occurred in Newton, Connecticut; but that tragedy is only made worse when politicians use it as the supposed “catalyst” for pushing an addenda that has been years in the making and would have been rolled out, regardless, following the November 2012 elections.

Therefore, I call upon those of you who love our rights and freedoms to immediately take peaceful action to defend the 2nd amendment.  Please, if you are not a member of the NRA, spend the $30.00 and join; this fight is too important not to have every gun owner standing side by side in the ranks of patriots, defending our freedoms. 

Then, get involved in the political process and write your elected representatives; tell them that you will not tolerate any lack of support for the 2nd Amendment and demand that they represent your views not those of liberal, anti-gun politicians in states that could not be more different than ours.  

We must Act on our beliefs; but only in a way that demonstrates our courage and commitment to peace and freedom and which reflects the core values that our country has long aspired to demonstrate to the world.  

God Bless and Protect Our United States!"

Make no mistake, it is a man killer and the ammo is relatively inexpensive, if you buy Russian Ammo. Today, the trick is finding an AK that is inexpensive,yet dependable,which is what i am offerring. The AR-15 fires roughly a 62gr. bullet and travels at speeds of 3,000 - 4,000+ fps. The cartridge (223 Remington) costs a bit more than the cartridge for your AK (7.63X39 Russian), however, not that much more, if you buy Russian Cartridges and look for sales. This rifle is acceptable for home defense. If you are also interested in Cartridges i could also get you that."

It is their Smooth Carbine model 8200. This is a complete high end factory rifle, not something put together in a basement. If you are looking for a top of the line rifle, this is it. One thing I love about this rifle is how comfortable it is in the hand, a lot of that is due to the handguard which allows you to have rails where you need them and no in places that interfere with your hand or rest. The 8200 also features their Black Diamond fluting which reduces weight, increases heat dissipation and looks awesome. It has an excellent trigger and is very accurate. I am able to consistently ring steel at 500+ yards with this rig. It only has 330 rounds of factory ammo fired, and was always properly cleaned and maintained. It is as close to new as you will find a rifle that has been shot.

I have added a few upgrades to make the rifle even better. I installed a Troy Battle Ax stock which gives a great cheek weld and also makes it more effective as a CQB rifle. I added a Ergo Grip which is a big comfort increase over the stock grip. The factory stock, grip and hardshell case are included as well. I am also including a windowed PMAG, along with 2 Colt magazines, one Sig Sauer, a Bushmaster and one NHMTG for a total of 6 magazines!

I am located in Canton, but make trips to Youngstown, Akron and Cleveland frequently. Any questions please ask. The price is FIRM. I will not take a penny less. Atlas Bipod shown in photos is not included in the sale.

The BVL280 provides an incredible 280 lumens of light in momentary or constant-on mode. Both models have a sophisticated electronic power management system that delivers maximum output for up to 2 hours, then backs down the output to give you up to 24 hours of usable light from one set of batteries. It even reduces the power if it senses the light is overheating - amazing!
Both lights come with three color filters (red, green, and blue) to make the BVL highly adaptable to different illuminating tasks, plus rubber rings that you can slide over the body to serve as finger stops when employing the popular “syringe” grip technique. The free-spinning lanyard loop rotates a full 360° so the lanyard (also included) won’t get tangled."

CIA GP 1975 AK-47.  Not a WASR-10. Tapco Handguard, Tapco Buttstock, Tapco Pistol Grip, Tapco G2 Double Hook Trigger, and Tapco retainer plate. 1 (30) round Pro Mag magazine, 1 (30) round Tapco Magazine, and 1 (10) round Tapco magazine. Slanted muzzle brake. Also have a dust cover scope mount. It is not currently installed on the rifle, but it comes with it. Rifle comes with somewhere around 150 rounds of ammunition.  Not sure exactly how many I have on hand, But it is in that ball park.  May be more, I can not recall at the moment. 

The Magpul AFG in the picture is not included, however if it is a dealbreaker, I'll throw it in. Makes shooting this rifle extremely comfortable and puts your hand at a very natural position. 

I have had this rifle for over 2 years. It has performed flawlessly every single time I have taken it out (It's an AK!)

Asking $1200, but I am VERY open to trades. See below

Chamber:  3 in.
Barrels:  26 in.
LOP: 14 in.
Year:  The label is XXIV (Beretta’s (Italy) code for 1968)
Choke: The Beretta certification paperwork states that the chokings are c.++++ and ++++. According to my research, I believe this means both are IMPROVED CYLINDER (1/4 CHOKE). However... the barrels are not marked. The barrels are labeled Skeet 1 and Skeet 2, but I believe this is in reference to the barrel sequence and not indication of the choke. Therefore, this is a field Gun, not a skeet gun.

Ammo? I have lots of .308 GMM 168 grain and lots of handloaded 165 Hornady. All of my handloads weighed within .3 grns of each other using CCI primers and IMR4895 powder. I may include ammo is price is met. As a matter of fact, my handloads were my precise and more accurate than the Federal GMM 168 BTHP.

This rifle is extremely accurate and very consistent. See attached pictures. It has been shot less than 100 times, and using only Federal GMM or my handloads.  This is a 3 shot group at 275 yards using a bean bag off a picnic table. I don't own a lead sled. If it isnt practical accuracy, it has no use as far as I am concerned. You don't carry a lead sled into the woods when hunting pigs or deer. I have harvested multiple pigs and a few deer with this rifle. It is absolutely mint and ready to go. With the current setup, I have outshot the ""ready made snipers"" with bolt action 700's and $200 dollar scopes, in addition to outshooting good 700's with work. I MAY CONSIDER TRADES FOR NEWER MODEL SNOWMOBILES. NO JUNK THOUGH. I DON'T WANT YOUR 2001 MXZ 600!
