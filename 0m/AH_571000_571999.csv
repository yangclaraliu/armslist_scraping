Purchased this Mini a few years ago and it rarely gets used. Shoots fine and has fed everything we have put through it. Unknown round count but when I got it it appeared fairly low. Since I have owned it it has seen about 500 rounds over the years. Has shot everything we have fed it without a hiccup. The stock has some safe dings and the bbl has one wear spot. The wear spot looks to be caused from leaning inside the safe because it is in only one spot about where a safe supports it. It really is a solid shooter and the next owner will very happy with it.

The 770 is an excellent starter rifle and perfect for someone who is looking for a solid deer hunting rifle on a budget before the season is in full swing. 

This 770 is approx. 1 year old and still under Warranty. The rifle is in mint condition as well as the rifling. This 770 was purchased new in October 2011 and has been kept immaculately clean (thoroughly cleaned after every trip to the range). Rifle has ~400 rounds through it. Extremely accurate and more than capable of tight groupings, especially with Remington Core Lokt 180gr ammo which it seems to like shooting the most. 

Best part about this particular 770 is that it does not have the bolt cycling issues - I sent the rifle to the Remington HQ in Ilion, NY a month ago to have this corrected. Remington filed the burr in the receiver and replaced the bolt stop, so this particular 770 has a smooth-cycling bolt. Remington paperwork (proving the bolt fix) and original retail purchase receipt will be included with transaction. 

Here's what is included:
- Remington 770 Rifle, .308 Win caliber - excellent/mint condition, clean barrel, not a spec of rust
- 3 770 Mags, 1 brand new still in packaging
- Brand New Bushnell 3-9x40mm Riflescope (the scope that is currently mounted in the photo will NOT be included)
- Bipod
- Nylon sling
- Plano Rifle case (shown in photo)

It was a Special Limited Edition for the highest volume Bushmaster distributor in the USA.  Bushmaster had few extra (3 each actually) of 3 special, limited edition Bushmaster AR15's they offered to a small FFL in southern NJ when he asked to order some rifles.  I bought this but the other two were also awesome, in fact I REALLY wanted to buy another and have a pair of rifles that were configured differently but I ended up buying one of the best.

This is a 14.5"" heavy barreled carbine.  The 14.5"" HBAR is exactly like the M4A1 carbine assigned to the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).  Unlike the M4 assigned to front line infantry troops, the M4A1 is fully automatic and designed for customization by the individual soldier.  (THIS RIFLE IS NOT FULL AUTO LET ME MAKE THAT CLEAR).  So this Bushmaster has the same style heavy barrel 14.5"".  This completely increases the accuracy, rigidity, resistance to heating up, and increased durability.  In then is finished with a combination NJ LEGAL Muzzle Brake / Compensator.  It is a copy and reconfiguration of the Muzzle device on Russian AK-74 Assault rifle.  It was designed to allow Soviet conscripted troops from across the communist empire to fire the fully automatic, 5.45 high velocity round assault rifle with minimal to bare training, and do so with high degrees of confidence and accuracy.  This muzzle brake and compensator virtually ELIMINATES any and all muzzle climb (""barrel flip"") and takes whatever recoil a 5.56 AR-15 actually had to begin with, down to none.

The carbine is then completely customized piece by piece and given a full Magpul treatment.  I am a huge Magpul fan and I also like to have my firearms looking great in addition to feeling and firing great.  We started with a HUGE upgrade at buttstock, with the Magpul Compact-Type Restricted buttstock.  a new receiver extension was installed with the CTR stock and then professionally 'permanently' pinned for NJ legal compliance.  It was pinned by the gunsmith 1-spot from the fully collapsed position.  My gunsmith is a former Army infantry combat veteran, police officer and SWAT Team member and instructor, and private security company contractor/operator having worked in both Iraq and Afghanistan multiple rotations each.  He told me that was the best spot for a fighting carbine, then produced his full-auto (hes in PA) combat / duty M16 with its upgrades and the stock was exactly the same as I was thknking/he was recommending so we did that exactly the same.

On the bck of the receiver , on the extension ""buffer tube' I also had a top-notch 'end plate' installed ... a 'CQD' Brand rear dual-sided single point multi style sling mount end plate.  Designed for several different sling styles and mounting technique/styles and also compatible with ambidextrous use.

Then I continued replacing and customizing the entire rifles furniture/etc. to make it the ultimate civilian combat carbine.  The pistol grip is the Magpul MOE with the inner storage core capability (you can buy purpose-built inner cores to hold specific things like a spare bolt, AA batteries, etc.) or do what I do, and I had a handful of spare 5.56 rounds, a spare battery for the optic, an allen wrench just-in-case, and a cleaning cloth for the optic.

I also went all the way and replaced the trigger guard with the Magpul MOE polymer Trigger Guard.  This allows the use of combat gloves in all weather, allows the use of heavy-duty-type cold weather gloves )and still get your finger in the trigger guard to access the trigger(, it smoothes rough edges of the metal trigger guard and adds to the color scheme.

Then we replaced the hand guard and added the AWESOME Magpul MOE Handguard.  I could type paragraphs on how awesome this is , heavier duty plastic so its more rugged , smoother on the hands, allows for all types of customizing... you can add picatinny rails OR Magpul accessories directly onto it, etc.  Double metal heat shield, etc.

Then it was added the Magpul MVG fore grip, the Magpul Vertical Grip which attaches DIRECTLY TO THE MOE HANDGUARD.  Awesome.  And its compatible wth the Magpul Thumbreak Method of combat carbine/rifle gripping/shootingetc.  you have to do your own research on it.  

On to the MOE handguard I added three small picatinny rails for general future use.  I have not used them yet but you could add your bright white light (a torch like a Streamlight etc.) a laser / designator, a forward slight mount (I was going to add those three options myself).


I also added the Magpul Back Up Sight , MBUS folding flip-up/flip-down combat sight on the rear of the receiver-picatinny rail.  This flips down and stays out of your optic way (if you decide to mount a red dot sight, a holographic/reflex sight, or actual scope etc.) and deploys with a SNAP up just by pushing a little on it.  Then you  can use it with the factory front sight base and shoot the iron sights.  My idea is , sight the iron sights in at the range at one distance, say 100 yds.  And your red dot sight might be sighted in at whatever distance your choice is, what you might engage the most at, 25 yds 50 yds 75 yds whateve.r Then you can shoot both depending.

OH YEAH- in addition to completely customizing this M4A1 style Close Quarters Battle (CQB) Combat Carbine with my main Magpul accessories I Did it all in Olive Drab Green. So it looks awesome.




I hate the idea of selling this.  to be short ,I haven't worked in over 2 coming up on 3 years while I recover from major back surgery.  my total disc replacement surgery was done bad, my prosthesic disc is crooked, and at the age o 31 now not only am I broke spinally but broke financially.  And I need the money.  I had it up, had some offers, decided to not sell it cause I didn't like the offers enough and really liked the rifle.  THEN I had a bunch of offers. I TOOK THE ONE who seemed the most serious and the one who said he loved the rifle and wanted it ASAP.  Then he didn't come right away to pay.  Then he said the end of the week.  Then he blew that day off and send the next day. Then today he blew it off  and that is it.  I told him i was done with him and he said, OK I'll email you on Monday and we'll talk about rescheduling (WHICH IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN)...

Well I have not worked cause of the back surgery, all money stopped, and I am broke.  That's why I am selling my rifle.  Because my heart n soul sick dog needs a trip to the vet, and some other stuff (tests ,treatment, meds, etc.) and I made a deal with this person who stiffed me time after time and had the bhalls to say to me, ""Are you driving up to meet me after I did all this work or are you a scammer"".  I never said I would drive to this person, and he asks me if I'm the scammer? NO>

So please don't attempt to make a deal with me if you're a bamboozler or looking for a mark.


It was $1100, I put $500 parts plus a few in gunsmithing charges. And by the way the rifle has basically NEVER BEEN FIRED.  The gunsmith fired it about 5 times to function check after all his work and adjusting the sights confirming the zero.  THAT WAS IT, I took it home and saved it for SHTF/Zombies. I've cleaned and oiled it a bunch over the two years i had it.. but never took it out.  So its' virtually brand new.

$1450 be reasonable and I will be, you're really making out like a bandit here."

PSE Nova Compound Bow Review 70#, Left Hand

The PSE Nova Compound Bow is an excellent choice for archery enthusiasts of any age or experience level. It offers a revolutionary design idea that allows for adjustment of draw back and weight that spans a wide enough gap that this bow becomes suitable for young beginners or skilled hunters alike. The PSE Nova Compound bow has been created with comfort and ease of use in mind. With it’s easy to handle configuration and adjustable settings, the PSE Nova is one of the best-selling bows among hunters and archers. The light weight and adjustability make this bow is especially well suited for those hunters who often hike for extended periods before reaching their favorite hunting grounds.

The PSE Nova compound bow is shipped with a standard 29 inch draw setting, but can be easily adjusted to fit anyone. The draw length of the PSE Nova can be tailored from 27 inches to 30 inches with an easy to use inner module. If you need a shorter draw length than 27 inches, you have the option to purchase an additional adjustment module that allows for a draw length of 25 inches to 28 inches. All adjustments are easily made, without the use of a bow press simply by using their modules. This bow is available in 50, 60, or 70 draw weights, so even a learning beginner should have no trouble with this compound bow.

The entire PSE Nova Compound bow weighs a mere 3.8 lbs. which makes it ideal for long treks or hunting expeditions and the Vibracheck rubber grip gives you superior handling quality. The smooth draw cycle and IBO speed of up to 303 fps have made this bow one of the company’s longest running styles and most purchased by hunters. It comes completely assembled and ready to shoot straight out of the box, adding to the ease and accuracy of the bow. It offers machined aluminum risers for optimal durability in the field and has a factory installed sight.

The superior ease and quietness with which the PSE Nova Compound Bow performs makes it a valuable tool for hunters. Add to that the lightness in weight and adjustability for draw length, and you’ve got a keeper. Suitable for beginners to experienced hunters, and highly accurate and easily tunable for practice shooting, this bow is a perfect option for any archer. The PSE Nova Compound Bow is powerful enough to get the job done and easy enough to use that it’s not a burden to pack with or in sudden sightings."

I won't say it is new in box, but it is pretty darn close. I have never shot it. I bought it from the original owner. He told me he took it to the range once and I believe it. I would suspect it has less than 100 rounds through it. The stock is in mint condition other than one VERY minor scrape, which I showed in the photos. The only other flaw is the castle nut has finish removed ever so slightly trying to get it off.

I switched out the original muzzle brake for a CA legal, modified USGI M14 flash hider from Ted Brown. It gave it a more military look that I was going for. I have the original muzzle brake that will be included. It comes with the original box, paperwork, tools and two 10 round mags. 

TRADES: I would be interested in a partial trade with cash to cover the difference for a handgun (preference given to a compact 1911 or pre-lock S&W/Colt revolver) or a C&R Winchester 1894. Will travel for the right deal.

For sale is a Like New In Box Glock 37. It comes with 1 magazine, and box.

The gun is basically brand new. It still shows signs of Glock's packing ""orange grease"".

It's chambered in Glock's proprietary G.A.P. (Glock Automatic Pistol) which is a short necked .45 caliber.

It shoots slower than a .45ACP and there less ""felt"" recoil.  The ballistictics are better than a 9mm or .40 Cal which comparable recoil to a .40cal.

It can be suppressed with a .45ACP silencer and will actually shoot quieter in many instances since it is a slower round.

I enjoy the .45 GAP, I need to sell this one b/c I just bought a Classic 1971 Mustang and need to fund that project : )

Beautiful Rifle... REALLY... don't want to part with it... but recently bought something else. Nice sling and basic case.

This is a special hunting rifle... in looks and performance. Real power but... very manageable size... easy to carry. Kick protection and even though it is kind of a light feeling extremely well balanced and made... rifle in the woods... it has quite a kick. The rounds are expensive: you sight it in... and use it for your real Rifle in the woods when you're not fooling around... .

Comes with original sling with Chinese writing, original cleaning rod and cleaning kit, and I am including a soft case as well.  This was made at the /0223\ factory in China and comes with the original spike bayonet installed.  This gun looks and functions great.  Also included is a pack of 10 stripper clips and 100 rounds of Silver Bear Russian Match 7.62x39 ammo.  This gun is a cherry, only has minor handling wear on the stock.  You rarely see a Norinco in this good of condition.  Every serial numbered part on this gun matches.

I hate to part with this awesome package. 

This gun is ready to be used for whatever your need is. From Tactical Ops, Hunting, Range Shooting, Urban Defense, a Truck Gun, Home Defense, or just to show off.

-4 Steel magazines!!!
-2-point Multi Sling, able for typical over the shoulder use. ABLE to use as a 1 point style"" and many more functions than I've figured out.
-An Authentic EoTech Holographic Weapon Sight! I have more pictures available. This is the 512 model that runs on everyday double AA batteries.

it is sighted in and co-witnessed with the front sight and rear flip up sight.

-A.R.M.S. Rear Flip up quick 1-hand release Sight.
-Fully collapsable rear stock
-All 100% Rock River Arms AR-15 with matching serial numbers

-I'm also throwing in for the winning bidder a nylon carrying case / storage case that retails for about $59.99 on its own. It fits the AR platform perfectly allowing room for optics foregrips, etc. It has enough pockets to carry 5 additional magazines on the outside, plus whatever else you can cram inside.


This package is literally complete for a wide platform of uses. If you want to complicate it and Tacticool it up more maybe a quad rail...foregrip. 
I didn't find any of that necessary as it adds bulk and weight. I'm a firefighter and carrying heavy gear 60-70lbs bunked out with handtool I learn to appreciate the simpler things in life, but if you're doing SpecOps or TacOps or want a Weapon mounted Light go for it!


I purchased this rifle from a retired Police Officer - SGt. Who had it for several years and hardly used it. I have to admit I have not shot it much either, but it has an amazing factory trigger (research Rock River Factory AR Trigger), and is pretty badass. I've never had a malfunction or issue with it, just need to fund other projects

The EoTech is bright and functions flawlessly, no scratches, lens is clear.


The Rock River AR Brand New is:                      $915+
The EoTech 512 Brand New is:                          $415

The Sling                                                         $35
The Carry Case                                                $60
                                                                  _________

     $1,530.00 + Install (Tax??)


I'm not messing around. This package is ready to Rock and Roll as soon as you are. Just in time for hunting season if you want to get some varmits or what have you. I really want to start the price higher $1,250 or at least 1,200. But I just bought a new vehicle and want this SOLD!!!


No Trades, Firm on price. This package is cheaper than MOST other ARs come Bare Bones after taxes. All No B.S. upgrades.


Available FTF in East Texas, occasionally I'm in DFW. Or can Ship for $25.00 to an FFL.


Check out this Similar Package for $2,350!!! My package is half the price!!!!

Asking $110 cash FTF.

This particular holster is made for the Glock 26/27/33 pistol, right-handed, with the leather-lined kydex option. Comes with heavy-duty MTAC clips (http://www.comp-tac.com/product_info.php?products_id=81) for 1.5"" wide belts. Also fits Glock 19/23, muzzle will peek past the kydex, but covered on the leather side. In excellent condition, as shown in photos (carried for just a couple months, but ended up selling the pistol).

I have tried many of the other IWB holsters of this style (think CrossBreed ST, MTAC, etc). They are all good, but the Answer has the highest-quality hardware and build, least amount of surface area, and most careful attention to detail. The suede backing greatly improves comfort and the leather-lined kydex protects finish and quiets the draw. If you are looking for top-shelf, this is it.

Looking for a Glock shooter who can give this excellent holster a good home, this may be the last holster you ever buy! Comes with Allen wrench for adjusting ride height and cant.

This is my current carry holster (but for an M&P), so happy to answer any questions you may have.

Thanks for looking!

Aficionados of the .45 ACP and .38 Super can get their brand of firepower in a medium frame package with the Taurus 945 and 38S pistols. Sized for carry, these models weigh-in at just 29.5 ounces - yet are full featured and built for a lifetime of tough use. These medium frame guns offer the same features as Taurus' popular large frame 92 series pistols, including drop hammer forged steel slide and forged ordnance grade alloy frame with three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety that allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever."

This is a super solid, comfortable, reliable, accurate 9mm. Includes two mags (16 + 1) and a Fobus paddle holster. I've fired about 300-400 rounds through this pistol without a hiccup, it is in like new condition. This and my 1911 are my most accurate pistols that I own, ahead of my xd, xdm, m&p, pps, and glock 19. Of the polymer framed guns I've shot, this and the Walther PPQ are definitely the most accurate. Unfortunately, I really just don't shoot a whole lot of pistols anymore so I'm selling most of them off and dumping a little more money into my AR.

It has a really great trigger, light crisp single action, or decock it to have a longer double action pull if you'd prefer while you carry. It is a hammer fired pistol, with a decocker, which I personally prefer over striker fired polymer guns. It's compact enough to use as your concealed carry, but large enough to get a nice solid grip. 3.8"" barrel with the U style glock type rear sight. Very comfortable backstrap and thin slide, mixed with the great trigger allow this to be a really accurate pistol.

Some photos below and some size references with the few pistols that I have left (xdm 9mm 4.5"", Walther PPQ 9mm, and Walther PPS 9mm). The xdm is a larger pistol, the PPQ is a mid size and the PPS is a single stack small pistol. The CZ P-07 is just a tad smaller than the PPQ.

NIB never fired

This is the 5th AR15 I've built on the Smith and Wesson AR platform. Smith and Wesson is a world renowned firearm manufacturer and the AR15 that I'm selling is covered by their lifetime warranty.

I bought and built this one for a friend of mine but he lost his job before I was finished.  Now I'm selling it for what I have into it.

Upgrades:
1) Full length aluminum quad rail
2) Flip up Magpul rear sight
3) Illuminating adjustable front sight
4) All aluminum foregrip with 200 lumen light that has an extremely disorienting strobe light setting for anyone downrange of the muzzle
5) Tactical red dot recticle with multiple views and illuminating / brightness settings
6) Ambidextrous tactical sling attachment
7) 1 point tactical bungee sling
8) Magpul 30 round magazine

I built one exactly like this one for myself a year and half ago and I've put well over 2,500 rounds through it.  Everything I've added to the rifle and the rifle itself has worked flawlessly.

The look of the rifle is totally badass and every time I've taken mine to the range it always attracts a crowd.

Just take it to the range and it's ready rock and roll.

Now lowball offers will be considered.

Gun has less than 200 rounds through it and is externally in like new condition, no wear, scratches or any other visible signs of use. It is so much like new that I could have probably lied and said it was unfired and gotten away with it, it is in that good of condition. Never holstered, always stored in foam. 

I have decided that this gun isn't really a necessity for me, I have a similarly sized gun that I prefer over this one and I find myself not shooting this one as much as I shoot the others I have. 

I was just at a local shop and they were asking $385 + tax for the gun brand new with a single magazine, spare magazines were priced at $40 each. If you were to buy what I am selling here in the store brand new it would cost just over $500 after tax. My asking price is $350. 

I am placing a trade value half way between my cash price and retail value, so trade value is going to be $425. 

What is included is the CW9 pistol, factory box, paperwork, lock, the factory magazine, and two additional Kahr magazines. 

My price is firm, if you can't shell out $350 for $500 worth of gun then we do not need to do business with eachother. I feel like this is already one heck of a deal and there are too many people that browse this site and feel like they should offer a little less no matter how good the price already is. 

All trades will be plus or minus cash to make things even, I have what I am looking for listed below, if what you have to offer is not on the list feel free to email me, the worst I can say is no."

Due to the fact that it is a free floating barrel coupled with good ammunition, this is an extremely accurate rifle and will get the job done!

The gun has fired 400-500 rounds flawlessly and has been cleaned often.  It is amazingly accurate for such as small gun.  Everything is stock except the finger extension on the 9 round mag.  Comes with two 12 round mags.  All original paperwork included.

I fired this gun and a Glock 27 back-to-back and this is the gun I bought.  It points and shoots great and has some really nice safety features.

Also comes with a full setup for concealed carry:

Original Springfield kit in case (holster, mag holster, speed loader, lock).

Galco Kingtuk tuckable hybrid holster.  The gun disappears in this holster even under a t-shirt or tucked-in shirt.

Desantis Sof-tuk.  Similar to the Kingtuk but can be worn in more locations around your belt.

Bianchi belt slider.  Allows you to take off the gun without taking off the holster.  It lies flat on your belt when empty.

Fobus paddle holster.  Not very concealable but nice and comfortable.

Also included are 20 rounds of Hornady Z-max defense ammo and 150 rounds of Georgia Arms FMJ target ammo.

All together this is about $750 in gear.  Asking $600.  A valid TN handgun permit will be required to purchase."

Sharp as Saladin’s legendary blade, the sleek, classically curved Cold Steel® Scimitar® places the power of the sword in your pocket.
Our craftsmen have captured the timeless quality of superior cutlery and united it with the finest in modern materials. The result is a dazzling, high impact folding linerlock® like no other knife available.
The Scimitar® blade is hollow ground stainless steel, honed to razor sharpness and features the famous curve of its ancient namesake. Painstakingly designed to facilitate the draw cut, the most effective cutting stroke known to man, the blade also features a needle sharp point which pierces at the slightest touch.

Superior engineering combines traditional appeal with the latest Western technology in the contoured Zytel® and steel frame handle designed exclusively by Lynn Thompson for the Cold Steel® Scimitar.® The pistol grip handle facilitates all types of forward grips, including the saber, quarter saber and hammer grips. Its sleek curves, finger grooves and checkering settle naturally and securely into the hand, maximizing the user’s ability to control both the edge and the point. Reverse or palm reinforced grips are mastered with ease, making the pistol grip shape of the Cold Steel® Scimitar® handle one of the most versatile and user-friendly ever devised. A hard-hitting ball shaped pommel contributes to the Scimitar’s® rock steady grip and versatility. The pommel can be used as a striking tool to deliver less than lethal blows to nerve centers and soft targets. It can also serve as a secondary grasping point, allowing the user to extend his reach by as much as three inches.

Lock strength is critical in a high performance knife, and the Scimitar® is head and shoulders above the rest. We have equipped the Scimitar® with a state-of-the-art titanium linerlock® for maximum strength and durability. The strength of titanium is peerless in the cutlery industry, and tests on this mechanism resulted in it holding 100 pounds without collapsing, far exceeding the load-bearing ability of our competitors.

A pocket clip makes it a snap to carry and access quick as a flash. Feel the extraordinary power of history’s most famous sword design in a folding knife of unequaled versatility- and put it in your pocket - with Cold Steel's Scimitar®.
