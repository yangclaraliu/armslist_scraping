This was a labor of love gun with only approx 450 round down range (flawlessly).  I really like the design of the 90-two and the benefits it has over the 92 or M9 (less parts, thicker slide, slim grip).  The only reason I'm looking to trade or sell is to get a Glock C model, or a 1911 (preferably a Kimber or Colt), or another nice polymer frame gun.  We can do bill of sale cash and carry with a valid ID and over 21, we can do transfer at Kaw Valley Gun club, holsters and more, or a local pawn shop.  Please see below for a list of customizations.

Includes (3) 17 round Genuine Beretta Magazines, original trigger and spring, original plastic guide rod (-spring), box, papers, lock.
Blackhawk kydex holster and dual magazine holder, holster has duty drop, belt, and paddle attachments and hardware to attach.

This is a Beretta 90-Two customized to be a Vertec.  Modifications include:
Flush fit recrowned barrel, polished and basic trigger job (sear smoothing and D spring) (by professional gunsmith)
Stainless Steel captured guidrod from guiderod.com.
Wolf trigger spring upgrade. (drop in)
Genuine Beretta Vertec short reset trigger, polished. (self polished)
Genuine Beretta Elite II skeletonized hammer, polished. (self polished external only)
Slim grip, stippled on pattern, this is a straight grip rather than the normal Beretta grip with a palm swell, it's modeled directly after the Vertec grip. (self stippled, perfect)
Genuine Beretta 'D' hammer spring
Polished trigger bar. (self polished)
The barrel and trigger bar were polished due to finish wear after first firing, the hammer and trigger were done to match, it is a ""brushed"" finish which is suggested so that the pieces will retain oil.

The mussle of the precision match, 16-inch barrel is cut with a 1:28 thread to accept various muzzle breaks and flash hiders.
 The three-position shoulder stock is adjustable for length, features a sling buckle mount and it has a two-position cheek rest that adjusts for height. The stock is fitted with a metal hinge to fold to the side with a polymer frame hook to lock the stock in the folded position for tactical training exercises. 
Comes with 22-round magazine. The adjustable front and rear rifle sights can be folded down to make room for a scope. When in the down position, the sights become a three-dot pistol system. 
The charging handle is part of the patent-pending Universal Charging Adaption System (UCAS), which allows the handle to be moved to three locations on the right or left side of the gun. The hollow grip is fitted with a removable base plate so it can be used for storage. Tan finish.

First - I will NOT take $100 for this ammo, FIRM means FIRM. Second, I am not interested in driving more than a few minutes to meet unless the deal is significantly in my favor. Third - I will consider trades of other ammo that I can use. 9mm, .380, .22  - However, I will not even consider some of the rediculous prices. AND I will consider trades for other firearms.... see below for more info.

I have approx 500 rounds of .40 S&W ammo that I no longer need since i recently sold my only .40 caliber handgun.

250 Rounds Blazer Brass
180 Rounds Federal Range/Target (brass)
25 Rounds Remington Golden Saber 
20 Rounds of Federal Premium Home/Personal Defense
15 Rounds of Horniday Zombie Max

Price is $200 FIRM - this is a very good price based on what I just looked at from the Summit County gun show and a couple local gun shops.

All the ammo has been purchased in the last 90 days, so this is not old stuff lying around.

Trade considerations: I am interested in smaller sized handguns, including but not limited to: small pocket .25s, .22s, .32s, .380s, 9mms. I do not want any full size or junk guns. 

Also interested in pump action 12ga or 20ga

It is lite, fast and accurate. The XM15-ES2 sports a removable carry top handle. If you do not like the classic look of the handle you can remove it and add any combination of more modern sights and scopes you please. It has a 16” chrome lined barrel and chamber, six position collapsible stock, sling, foam lined hard plastic case and a Bushmaster 30 round removable magazine. As you will see in the pictures this gun comes VERY well lubed and ready to shoot from the factory. This is the exact same model I bought years ago. I have put literally thousands of rounds through mine including steel cased, hand loads, and lots of military surplus. In all that time I have NEVER HAD A SINGLE FAILURE. Bushmaster is and will remain the standard in military quality M4 rifles for the civilian market. Firearm is LIFETIME GUARANTEED by my wholesaler.

I have only put 20 rounds through it, as i purchased this from a late uncles estate whom had more than three safes full.  So I am sure this wasn't shot much.  This rifle is dead on and love the dual set trigger which gives you a great hair trigger.
date code - VII81 - means it was manufactured in July of 1981

Rock River Arms PDS (Piston Driven System)
Chambered for 5.56

RRR PDS has a unique operation system which lends itself to reliable all condition operation blending the best of both direct short piston systems and long piston systems. As a result of this there is no buffer tube which allows for the stock not only to be collapsible as in a standard AR but also to fold to the side shortening the overall length of the weapon making it possible to conceal under a jacket or other type of garment.
This gas system prevents nearly all carbon and other contaminants normally introduced into the upper receiver during firing from entering the receiver and causing malfunctions.

Weapon has been maintained in clean ready to fire order and cleaned after each firing.
Weapon has exactly 560rnds fired with no malfunctions or issues.

I love this weapon and do not want to sell it but my wife is in need of hearing aids after she lost all of her hearing in one ear and most of her hearing in the other while serving in Iraq as a combat medic.

This weapon is set up in a fashion optimal for home defense but is easily re configurable for any SHTF scenario.

Included:
-RRR PDS w/ quad rail 16"" barrel chambered for 5.56mm
-Standard AR 6 point adjustable/collapsible butt stock which folds to side. (tube which holds the stock normally referred to as the buffer tube is sealed and can be used for storage)

I purchased this Bushmaster M4 A3 Patrolman's Carbine BRand New from Bass Pro Shop in Auburn Hills, MI on August 21, 2012. I fired 6 shots through it at Bass Pro's Range to check the sights (dead-on), took it home , cleaned & oiled it thoroughly, and it has sat in it's case every since- Consider it a New gun.

So I walked into Bass Pro this past Friday and I could not believe what I was seeing: Almost every handgun was gone from the showcase and there was not an AR-15 anywhere to be found. So I asked the manager, Keith, what the deal was. He said ""we can't keep guns in stock"" I then asked him about the AR-15's specifically and he said "" It could be months before we get anymore, we don't know when they are coming in and we will not put anyone on a wait list for them""

I went home and searched online to see that people are getting double and triple what they sold for new, so I decided to list mine. If you want and you are serious Great!, If not don't waste my time or yours.

The model on the box end is: BCWA3F 16M4. The UPS is REDACTED252. It will fire .223 or .556 NATO. The top carry handle is removeable so that scopes can be mounted on the picatinny rail. The stock telescopes, the gun is metal (not carbon or polymer), includes a nylon strap and a 30 round magazine. All original no modifications at all.

Please pick gun up from me in Clarkston, MI (30 mins north of Detroit off of I-75) and please pay cash. A bill of sale will be written up and I need to copy the information off of your driver's license for my files. I am a responsible gun owner and my intention is to sell this gun to someone responsible as well."

This rifle has a unique stock that folds under for storage (cannot be fired from folded position), and also holds two factory ten round magazines or a single twenty or thirty round magazine sideways. The foregrip is another interesting feature in that it folds down for use as a bipod. Its 18.5"" chrome lined barrel has a 1 in 9 twist, and is chambered for 5.56 NATO. It accepts AR15/M16 magazines, and comes with two factory supplied ten round magazines. The rifle is piston operated gas, and has a flat top, optics ready receiver with Picatinny spec rail. 

It's small, light and handy enough for self defense and packs well for hiking. Accurate enough for plinking out to a couple hundred yards without problem. I've got the original owner's manual and original takedown pin (I replaced it with a hitch pin for easy removal), but do not have the original box. Small amount of wear on finish of barrel where hand guards pivot down for bipod use.

This is a Mosin-Nagant rifle (1943 Izhevsk) that was converted into a sniper. The scope, mount and the rifle are in excellent condition. Sure, it ain't an original sniper it is the closest you can get to one without buying the real thing. 

Includes over 60 rounds of 7.62x54R ammo (24 soft point hunting rounds and 40+ FMJ) and a bayonet

Looking to sell for cash but I might take trades if i'm interested in what you have. 

Email if you want more pictures, have questions, or if you want to buy it. 

Questions that have been asked:

Q: Is the scope and mount original? 
A: I know it is Russian made and has all the features of a genuine PU scope (steel construction, german post reticle that moves in the field of view when adjusted, etc). However, it is in very good shape. Almost too good to have been from the  WWII era. There is no date stamped on it so I have no way of telling when it was made. One of my pictures shows the marking on the scope. I wish I could tell you more but that's all I really know about it. 

Q: Will you ship it to me? 
A: If you cover all the expenses and keep it legal yes. I'll need your FFL's contact info when you email me if you would like it shipped. After i discuss it with them I'll get back to you with the total price including the shipping and their fees. If it is shipped I'll accept postal money order only (no checks). The rifle will ship as soon as I recieve payment. I will not do a trade by shipping/FFL (Too many ways that can go wrong). However, I am willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet with you to do a trade in person. 

Q: will you sell the scope and mount seperate?
A: yes if you make me a good enough offer for it. Keep in mind that is the most expensive part of this rifle so you'll have to offer the majority of my asking price for me to even consider it. 

Q: will you sell for cash or trade locally? 
A: yes. I will meet you in the Titusville, PA (16354) area. Only arrange to meet if you are serious and definitely going to buy the rifle. If you have questions not answered here fell free to email and ask. I won't waste time and gas to meet with you if you are not buying.

These are BRAND NEW to the market. They are loaded loaded by Fiocchi using Fiocchi brass (and I would assume other components as well) and are branded for Tula (box is marked ""Made in Italy""). Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 14 boxes available. Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't wait. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

I customized this gun from the original wood stock, which I still have and will include in the deal.

I also have a spare stock tube which is angled to allow iron sight use under the scope mount.

The scope is a Barska 3-9x32. 
The bipod is a UTG. The legs are adjustable and the bipod folds up towards the barrel.
The laser is some cheap thing that does the trick.
The angled foregrip is a Magpul AFG2.

The gun comes with 2 magazines, 25 rounds each. I can throw in 200 rounds of ammunition, but that's all I have right now. I can also give you a cleaning kit for .22 caliber rifles. This is a used gun (Approx 500 rounds through it), but I'll clean it up for you. It's extremely accurate and the scope has a standard 25/200 military zero.

The only issue is that the front hand guard is a little loose. These are no longer for sale at any retailer, and are going to be on the immediate list of banned guns if the AWB passes by spring. If this does not sell, I have no problem keeping it as an investment.

Am open to trades for modern handguns, rifles, and revolvers, but I do not want your old military surplus clunkers, your hi-points, your single-action revolvers, or your 9mm ammo that you think is worth 40 cents a round. I reload, so I still get my ammo for reasonable prices. I am however interested in 5.45 ammunition as a partial trade, or straight across if you have a MASSIVE quantity of it."

With precise repeatability of shots as your goal,The Rock Deluxe Front Rest is the right tool for the job. The Rock helps eliminate the ""human factor"" in shooting and will help you shoot tighter groups.

 ■Wide and stable footprint dispersed over 5 1/2 lb. rest
 ■1"" diameter steel post provides smooth and quick elevation adjustments up to 7 1/4"" height
 ■Use the 3 leveling feet to level your rest on most any surface
 ■Forend stop ensures consistent stock placement from shot-to-shot
 ■Forend cradle is designed to accept all Caldwell Deluxe Universal Front Rest Bags
 ■Filled Medium Varmint front bag included

I've used several shooting rest / bunny bag sets over the years, from Wichita's on across the spectrum. Almost every long gun I've reviewed has been shot on the Caldwell ""Rock,"" and for the money you just can't beat it.

If you have never used a good, traditional, two-piece cradle system, you are in for a real treat. You likely won't believe how easy the ""Rock"" is to use, and you will likely discover that you shot better than you ever imagined. It makes every trip to the range more fun, more worthwhile, and is one of the best investments a shooter can make. The ""Rock"" is well made, and in terms of bargain for the buck nothing I have seen beats it. Available from Midway USA, and other dealers, it gets my highest recommendation/
