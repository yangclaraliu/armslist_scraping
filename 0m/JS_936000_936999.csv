The DPMS LR-308 Semi Auto Sniper System (SASS) was born of military necessity. US Military Snipers and marksmen overseas found themselves rapidly switching from scenarios involving precision long range shooting one moment, to close, violent encounters where they were at a disadvantage due to the low ammunition capacity and slow rate of fire of their bolt action rifles. The Government sought a solution to this problem...The DPMS SASS is the answer.With an 18” fluted bull barrel, free floating 4 rail hand-guards, and JP adjustable Trigger, it is capable of sub-MOA accuracy at long range, fulfilling its role as a precision rifle. The 19 + 1 ammunition capacity and semi auto fire control group ensure the shooter is never outgunned, and allows for faster follow up shots. The Magpul PRS stock (new for 2008, previous models feature a VLTOR modstock), Panther Flash hider, DPMS Mangonel back up iron sights, and A3 receiver, complete the package.  Picture does not represent upgrades. Model: RFLRT-SASSSpecifications:Barrel:18"" Length w/ Panther flash hider416 Stainless Steel6 grooves, right-hand 1x10 twist, button rifledChamber:7.62 NATOMethod of Operation:Gas operated rotating boltBolt & Carrier:8620 steel bolt carrier, heat treated and plated per Mil SpecPhosphated steel bolt, heat treated and plated per Mil SpecSights:Primary: - Optics (NOT INCLUDED)Backup - Mangonel Front & Rear flip-up sight (INCLUDED)Weight:Empty - 11.50 lbs.Length:Extended: 38 3/4""Collapsed: 35 1/2""Length of pull:10.5""(1st position)13.75"" (5th position)Bipod:Harris 9-13"" Swivel Series BipodBipod adapter made by FobusUpper Receiver:A3 style flattopThick walled, extruded from 6066-T6 aluminumHard coat anodized per Mil Spec and Teflon coated blackDust coverShell deflector and forward assist machined as one unitRight hand ejectionLower Receiver:Hard coat anodized per Mil Spec and Teflon coated black integral trigger guardAluminum magazine release buttonAmbi-Selector installedMilled from a solid billet of 6061-T6 aluminumTrigger:JP adjustable, 4.5-5 lbs pull adjustable for over-travel and take-upStock:Magpul PRS StockHandguards:Standard length 4-rail free floating, vented.

Quality gun out of Windham, ME.  Gun comes with 100 rounds of match Hornady ammunition.  Comes with 2 original 20 round bushmaster magazines, and a special five round magazine for DCM match shooting.  Gun has original case and cardboard box that it came in.  I am firm on $1700.  Not only is this the perfect match rifle, but you can put any upper on it you want.  Butt stock can easily be changed to magpul and you can have a lightweight carbine and a match rifle with 5 minutes of your time.  I have a scope mount and scope for the A2 style if you are interested let me know as it is not included in the $1700.  Below is a description of all the features this rifle has:

Camp Perry Limited Edition #43 of 100. Camp Perry insignia etched on receiver. This rife is specifically designed for DCM match competitions.  In keeping with DCM competition rules, this rifle looks like a stock AR15 (although it is far from stock). The A2 Rear Sight is specially modified to accept interchangeable micro-aperture peeps and its windage and elevation mechanisms feature either 1/2 or 1/4 MOA adjustments with each click of the windage knob or elevation dial.  The competition front sight is specially ground for optimum clarity. It is secured within the front sight base by a set screw to avoid the possibility of any movement. The 20"" Bushmaster extra heavy competition barrel is a full 1"" diameter under the handguard. They are machined from chrome moly vanadium barrel steel and are hardened to Rockwell C26 to 32 - which are superior to stainless barrels.  In the upper receiver, the bolt is carefully matched to the barrel extension for maximum strength and accuracy. The lower receiver houses a finely honed competition trigger job that is factory set for a DCM legal 3.5 lb. 1st Stage and a 1 lb. letoff (2nd Stage). The handguard set looks like stock gov't issue parts but is actually a free float type handguard (handguard/barrel nut combination) that does not contact the barrel. Special weights are installed inside this free floater handguard for added stability. Even the buttstock has been improved for competition with the addition of a lead counterbalancing weight."

The Kryptonyte® Center Mass™ Laser; an industry-first, laser system displaying a ring of green laser dots surrounding the center aiming laser for rifle and shotgun. Developed to decrease target acquisition time and increase levels of accuracy for rifles and shotguns with a Picatinny rail (3 inches or longer), the LaserLyte CM-15 helps the user quickly center the shot within the ring. The CM-15 projects a ring of 8 green laser dots with one green laser dot in the center as the aiming laser. The circle grows at one-inch per yard, approximately the same configuration as a shotgun aimed at a moving target. The green laser, which aids in daylight visibility, gives the user the advantage of a wide field-of-view while using both eyes for aiming. The user-friendly, military-styled laser with clear laser engraved markings has a recessed activation selector that can be changed to off, constant on and momentary on. The remote switch is used with the 10-inch length, 2-inch tape switch area with copper braided cord LaserLyte®

From their web site:

The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine.  It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine.  First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel.  Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds.  Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine.  Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. 

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market.

Brand new and unused. $40 each. I have six for sale."

Ill be up to up front with everything as long as you are with me.  This jeep needs some love and a new home. The jeep is my moms that she just gave to me. It has been park for a little and needs some work. I just put a new battery in it and starts right up n runs good. The tags are out but I'm trying to get them up to date as we speak just need a little money to get them. Ok so you ask why you say it needs a little love and here's the reasons, the vent system is not working for some reasons ac n heater works but don't come out the vents and yes the blower works. Lights not working but I'm going to get the switch for them and getting new tail light, Rear Differential is leaking but I'm getting the seal for that, the o2 is bad and going to order that, the power steering pump is bad. So all n all I'm going to order all this my next check next week so I can get the tags to get it back on the road but the big thing is my mom took out a title loan on it and is going to pay it off with the tax return so I'm looking to get that soon but dosent stop me because we can always make a agreement sign it so we have a legal document.  The jeep has a 4.7 v8 ,tan leather, 183xxx miles,blue in color. If this is something you want to know more about just text me at REDACTED I have some pics if you would like to see them."

It is a 2.5x50 tactical titanium.  I have included pics to show that the unit is still functional.  If you know what this is then you can quit reading.  If you do not however then this may be helpful to you.  The company now is Yukon.  Before these were Yukon they were Just Osprey's.  The night vision that Yukon makes is neat non the less, but not near what they used to be before the company was purchased by Yukon.  This is a gen 1, but is actually as good as the current gen 2 models.  The newer gen 1 models need light to assist where the gen 2 models will operate in complete dark.  This is clear in complete dark.  It needs no moonlight at all.  This scope is clear in pitch black up to 150 yards.  It has two setings.   Reticle which is the one pictured and infared.   This model is titanium with weaver style tactical rail mount.  It also has tactical rails on the side for a red dot while in infared mode or for even a genetic laser.  With a genetic laser this unit is clear up to 350 yards in complete dark.  I have the ND3.  I can spot wild game at night at 1/5 mile away.  Hog's Worst nightmare!!!  This is a hog hunters dream.  The unit sold new for $1350.  That is what a current gen 2 cost.  Put it up side by side and you will see why.  It also has a socket for a remote to activate with trigger finger so your hand never has to come off of the lower.  They do not make these any more.  The models now ar no where near the quality. It as well is shock proof.  2 AA batteries is what powers the unit.  email or call with any questions.

Collectible Smith & Wesson Revolver .38/44 Heavy Duty Model of 1950.

(I will include a buch of +p ammo I have also)

It is a postwar - Pre Model 20. (manufactured 1958 or 59) production ceased 1960. It is a .38 S&W Special, (or .38/44 which was like a really hot ++P load)  4"" barrel, Short throw hammer, It is a high gloss blue that is original and at around 98%, The original grips at 92%. I can find no wear on the frame but there is the usual drag mark on the cylinder of a used gun. The bore remains as new. Locks up tight and right. This model was offered by S&W from 1946 to 1950 and I am told about 2500 were made with the 4"" Barrel, though some gunsmiths were known to convert them to .357 mags, they are that tough. This gun is a full recessed and pinned revolver. Highly desirable and can shoot the hottest of .38 loads available. Do some research if you haven't heard of this gun. An older Blue Book of Gun Values puts this gun at $1000 for 95%. Even though I rate this gun at an easy 95% and more likely 96%, a real world attitude and the economy makes me put it at $750.00 All matching serial numbers on Frame, barrel, yoke, and stocks. Serious interested buyers can shoot me a message for more detailed pictures if desired.

HISTORY OF THE 38-44 HEAVY DUTY

In late 1929 and early 1930, due to armored vests and bulletproof glass for autos, the various big gangs around the country gave our police and law enforcement agencies a bad time. Colt answered the problem with the Super.38 Auto on the good old model 1911 design. The new arm shot a 130 grain bullet at 1300 feet and proved an answer to the problem. J . Edgar Hoover's boys promptly adopted it for their side-arm. It would penetrate bulletproof vests, armored car bodies if not too heavy, and bulletproof glass. The .38 S& W Special had been loaded with smokeless powder to equal the same velocity as it had achieved with black powder. As MAJ Doug Wesson analyzed the problem, he soon came to the realization that the answer was to increase the powder in the .38 Special. The answer was the .38/.44 S&W Special or the .38 High Velocity. Smith & Wesson soon realized during testing that this round was too hot for their standard Military and Police .38 Specials. A new model gun was needed to handle the increased pressure and recoil brought by the new round. In December of 1929, the order to build 500 .38/.44 Militaries as they were originally called was issued by Harold Wesson. The first orders were placed in early December 1929 which would indicate that the factory had announced the intent to manufacture them in late 1929. The new .38/.44 Heavy Duty was identical in construction to S&W 's earlier .44 Hand Ejector Third Model, with the exception of its .38 chambering. Initially the gun was only offered with a 5"" barrel, with a choice of blue or nickel finishes, weighing in at 40 ounces and checkered walnut service stocks. In November 1931, Smith & Wesson began production of the .38/.44 Outdoorsman which was an adjustable sighted Heavy Duty. On January 14, 1935 Harold Wesson ordered the factory to forge and machine 100 each 4"" .38/.44 barrels. There are recorded instances where 6.5 inch barreled Heavy Duties were manufactured. There are also instances where the Heavy Duty was manufactured in .45 Colt caliber. The 38/44 Heavy Duty was the most popular N framed gun in the 1930s with 11,111 manufactured before WWII halted production. The high speed .38 round in the .38/.44 led Doug Wesson, Winchester, and Phil Sharp to collaborate on a new, more powerful .38 caliber round they called the .357 S& W Magnum. The new gun they built it around was a Hand Ejector with adjustable sights called the Registered Magnum. After WWII, S& W began shipping 38/44 Heavy Dutys in the summer of 1946. These guns were Transition models which had pre war and post war characteristics. These models continued until 1950 when the 38/44 Heavy Duty Model of 1950 was produced. There were over 8,700 transition Heavy Dutys manufactured between 1946-1950. The post war catalogs listed the Heavy Duty as available in 4, 5 and 6.5 inch barrel lengths, blue or nickel. Production of the Heavy Duty continued until the early 1960s when they were called the Model 20. The known Model 20s were shipped in 1963. The last known Model marked guns, Model 20- 2s were shipped in late 1964 to Austin Police Department. In 1966, the Model 20 was dropped from the catalog.

 I just got the pistol a couple months ago, but only used it once..
 It had no FTF or FTEs,shot about 150 rounds flawlessly.Of 6 different kinds.
 Cleaned it before and after i shot it.Very accurate sweet plinker..
 A good first gun by far, Im just looking to get a CC handgun.
 Anyways It comes with 5 Smart Reloader 100 round cases(New) worth $12 and 120 rounds of various types including Viper,CCI Velocitor,American Eagle,Winchester Varmint..Also comes with a brand new Sightmark Sureshot Reflex Sight(Red Dot)worth $50.It has 4 different patterns in red and brightness adjustment to from 1-7..
 Also comes with microfiber cleaning cloth and rubber cover for lens.Also paper packaging that came with it..Also comes with a HKS .22 Speed Loader(worth $5)
 The gun comes just like new with Beretta hard case and CA certified lock and 2 mags also all paperwork.
 So originally the gun is $250 w/tax=around $275 w/backgroundcheck = $300
 The Red Dot is $50 w/tax=around $54
 The HKS Loader is $5 something w/tax
 and the Smart Reloader Cases equal out to about $13

 So thats about $370 worth
 I might be able to throw some cash on the trade to.Just let me know and we'll see if we can work something out..."

This is the old ""colt grey"" color that's why I paired it with the green, so you don't have 2 different color black halves of the receiver.

MOE hand guard (car length) and 6-position MOE stock, both black, with a sling attachment end plate. 


I got a dickhead making a BS $200 offer already so let me add this- do not waist my time, I know what I paid, I also know current fair market value, I'll accept a fair offer for this almost complete rifle, with the current prices your looking at about $500-600 for the barrel and BCG $800+$550=$1350 WAY UNDER what AR's are currently selling for.

I purchased them from Thermoldmagazines.com a few weeks back and really have decided that I want to stick with 30 round magazines. 

So heres the deal, I am not looking to gouge anyone, I simply want to get back close to what I spent.  Which was basically $25.00 each, plus tax and shipping.  So, I am selling all (6) magazines for $120.00 which does not cover what I spent but I'm still good with it.

If someone wants to split them up that's fine but due to travel time, the cost will go to $25.00 to $30.00 each depending on the quantity wanted and where you are located.  And I will give this listing a couple of days to see if there are any takers on the entire lot before I accept any offers on splitting up the group.

I would possibly be willing to trade these (6) magazines for (4) 30 Round PMAGS, but they would have to be new.  Otherwise I don't think that I would be interested in a trade.

The wood has the usual ding, dents and scratches, but they are all war time attrition, not recent. there are no cracks in the stock. No major surface rust or pitting visible on the gun, except a little dirty in the nooks and crannies under my light magnifier. The bore is shiny and bright with decent looking rifling. The visible serial number 0014 is the same on the receiver as on the barrel. The number on the stock is 60274. I do not see any numbers on the bolt or elswhere. The firing pin is present and looks good. There is no enlargement of the firing pin hole in the bolt face and it hold the round nice with no slop and extracts and ejects correctly. I have not disassembled the gun to further check it out either. The barrel crown looks good and there is no visible throat erosion. The throat edges are are clean and square not beveled or dinged. There is also an aluminum tag on the trigger guard that has the number ss45182 on it. Probably from some previous auction. This gun was probably worked up post WWII by the Italians for the Egyptians or the Israelis. (wasn't that nice of them to sell to both sides of a conflict?) Since there is no star on the rifle, the consensus seems to be Egyptian. I like how low the serial number is. There are no import marks or engravings of an american distributor on the gun. Great piece of history and fun to shoot. Comes with a box of 8mm surplus Yugo ammo and one enblock style clip. (new production clip, readily available and inexpensive)

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also.

A beautiful Over Under Featuring A Checkered English Straight Grip Walnut Stock and Checkered Schnabel Forend furniture in a high polish finish. Boxlock Action, Gold Single Selective Trigger, Automatic Ejectors, Black Vented Recoil Pad, Engraved Receiver And 26"" Polished Blued Vent Rib Barrels With Invector Screw in Chokes. Chambered For 2 3/4 - 3"" Shells. This gun locks up tight and right with the lever still well off center. Very little wear. There is some nice engraving on the receiver.

Comes With With a Browning presentation hard case. This Item Has A Few Light Handling Marks, Additional Close Up Photos On Request. This gun is the pinnacle upland game bird gun, the thin wrist of the straight stock, the light weight and the balance of the gun make it a dream to carry in the field. The gun shoulders fast and the shorter barrels makes this a very manuverable gun and the screw in chokes make it adaptable to any hunting, clays or skeet. I have some extra extended chokes for the gun also.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are a effing retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."

Other features that would cause a rifle to be banned include a forward grip; folding, telescoping, or detachable stock; grenade launcher or (as an absurd propaganda move) rocket launcher; barrel shroud; or a threaded barrel. 

Ban all detachable-magazine semi-auto pistols that have any of the following: a threaded barrel, second pistol grip, or magazine that mounts anywhere other than the grip. The bill would also ban any handgun that is a semi-automatic version of a fully automatic handgun.

Ban all semi-automatic rifles and handguns that have fixed magazines that accept more then 10 rounds.

Ban all semi-automatic shotguns that have just one of the following: a folding, telescoping, or detachable stock; a pistol grip; a fixed magazine that can accept more than five rounds, a detachable magazine; a forward grip; a revolving cylinder; or a grenade or rocket launcher. As with the rifle provision, this could potentially ban any semi-auto shotgun, because all of them have ""characteristics that can function as a grip."" And of course, countless Americans have pistol-grip shotguns for home defense.

Ban all belt-fed semi-automatic firearms, such as semi-auto replicas of historic machine guns.

Ban all frames or receivers of banned guns, even though in many cases they are identical to the frames and receivers of guns that would not be banned.

Ban ""combinations of parts"" from which ""assault weapons"" can be assembled. Read broadly, this could ban the acquisition of a single spare part that could be combined with parts you already own.

Ban any ""part, combination of parts, component, device, attachment, or accessory that is designed or functions to accelerate the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle""--a vague definition that could ban items such as competition trigger parts.

Ban the sale or transfer of all ammunition feeding devices that hold more than ten rounds. Even those lawfully possessed before passage of the bill could never be transferred, even to your heirs through a will.

""

Yes, your semi-auto tubular magazine .22 is now an ""assault weapon"", arguably, so is your Remington 1187 duck gun since the stock is ""detachable"". Got a defensive semi-auto shotgun like a Mossberg 930 SPX, Remington 1100, OR 1187 etc that has a tubular magazine that takes more than 5 rounds? Yep, that's a banned ""assault weapon"" too. 

THIS IS NOT ONLY ABOUT AR'S AND AK'S THIS IS ABOUT EVENTUALLY BANNING ALL GUNS AND TAKING AS BIG A BITE OF THAT APPLE NOW AS POSSIBLE. AND DON'T THINK FOR A SECOND THAT THE NEXT MOVE WON'T BE TO BAN PUMP SHOTGUNS AND BOLT ACTION RIFLES AS ""ASSAULT SHOTGUNS"" AND ""SNIPER RIFLES"". IF THEY PASS THIS THAT WILL COME SOON ENOUGH.

 Also contact House speaker John Boehner and tell him not to allow a vote for any gun control bills. Boehner decides what bills get to the floor for a vote in the house of representatives. If they can't vote on it they can't pass it. This is a particularly good option If your own rep is hostile to 2nd amendment rights. Anybody can contact the speaker, you do not have to be in his Ohio district.

Bought this gun new, previous owner never even fired it per the dealer.  I myself only put approximately 60 rounds through it.  It shoots great and is a ton of fun.  Only reason I'm even considering selling is the cost of .308 / 7.62NATO is a bit much, and because of that it has just been sitting in the safe.  That said, I'm not at all desperate to sell this beauty, and would rather keep it than take less than what I'm asking.

This is a great rifle, in pristine condition.  Prefer local buyer, must show Virginia ID & CHP, or pay for FFL.

The SW9VEs and SW40VEs barrels and slides are all professionally duracoated in matte black to match the frame (giving it an all black finish, much like the special edition VE's that were hard to find). I had the Barrels done as well, whereas some ive seen previously just did the slide. This adds to the durability of the barrel as well as the look. Also added adapters and red lasers to each as well. Each pair comes with 10 mags (5 mags per gun), with the 9VE mags being 16 rounds and the 40VE mags being 14 rounds. The reason the VE series also was the one where you could still make the trigger mods to them to lighten the trigger pull (2 of mine have the trigger job done already), while also being improved over the first series of sigmas. From what i hear, the SD series isnt able to do trigger mods. Looking to get $950 per pair

The mags alone are going for about $40 each on gunbroker, so between the 10 mags per pair, the duracoat, and the lasers, its a great deal

It is in great condition and runs absolutely flawlessly.  It comes with hard case and all of the Springfield gear.  The magazines were upgraded to Kimber mags.  I am only getting rid of this due to some upcoming expenses. I hate to do it because it is the nicest shooting 1911 I've ever owned.  This pistol has become pretty hard to find. It has a rail for a light and/or laser, an adjustable trigger, match grade barrel, and night sights.  The frame is much lighter weight that most 1911's so this is perfect for carrying.  
I'd be interested in partial trades on a cheaper commander size 1911 like a RIA, Citadel, American Classic, etc.  I would also be interested in partial trades on old lever action and pump .22s, and possible other .22s (nice ones). Especially wanting 9422, 39a, and any old .22 with tang/peep sights.
I am not even considering low offers on this.  I am in need of cash, but do not need it for a couple months, so I will not be accepting less than what it's worth.  Low ball offers will be ignored. Thanks for looking!"
