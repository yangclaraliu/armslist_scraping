Description 
The Colt model R6600 HBar, Colt's heavy-barreled version of the standard AR-15, is capable of increased accuracy over their regular counterparts. The 6600 HBars are incredibly accurate due to their 20"" heavy barrels. This rifle has all the original Colt packaging and comes with the original green label box. Bundled in the case is all the factory packaging, including mags, cleaning rods, paperwork, etc. When we say factory packaging, we mean all the way down to the factory cardboard plug that Colt placed in the barrels before shipping. Stored in a climate-controlled area for over 20 years, this 6600 HBAR Sporter is a true treasure. Bayonet lug on this pre-pan. This model was last produced in 1989
Details:
• Colt R6600 AR-15 A2 HBar Sporter
• Semi-auto 5.56x45mm
• New In Box: barrel plug, plastic muzzle cap on flash hider, factory tag on barrel, plastic bag, accessory bag with two 20 round mags, manual, cleaning brushes, and cleaning rods are all present.

The AK-47 is one of the most widely recognized weapons ever created and this Poly Tech AK-47/S National Match Legend is no exception.

This new in box pre-ban Legend is chambered in 7.62x39mm and comes with all the original paperwork and accessories. Even the original silica desiccant packs are in the box! 
Only 4,000 were ever imported. Few had the dark wood thus making it the rarest of them.  China Industries stopped production of this weapon in 1989. It is NIB

Disassembled, most of the parts are there except the wood and screws. This piece was disassembled by someone who knew nothing about guns so some of the screw holes are damaged. The gun has no finish and has some pitting. The bore is shootable. It is rough but could be brought back with some TLC. It was bought to convert to anpther caliber, but the situation changed and it's no longer needed. I am just looking to recoup my investment. Must be sent to an FFL.

This is an older model of EOTECH sight and I don't have the original box or remember with certainty what was the actual model number but I believe it is a model 512.

What follows is a description of the unit from experience and memory only.

The holographic sight image displays a very small MOA red dot sight in the center of a round halo ring.
Sight brightness is adjustable for all ambient lighting conditions. Very bright to very dim as needed.
Perfect for a CQB rifle. (Close Quarters Battle)
I'm offering it for sale because I sold the rifle it was attached to and I really don't need it on a different rifle.

There is full size glass aperture to look through which is designed to operate using both eyes open so that you can acquire the target very quickly.
What I like about this model is that it is very short and lightweight because it is powered by short N size photo batteries. (Two Energizer E90 N)

A word on battery life:
Originally, EOTECH sights got a bad reputation for batteries not lasting very long. 
I bought this sight brand new, always left the sight with batteries installed and eventually discovered that the batteries would go dead after a few weeks of the rifle just sitting in the safe.
I took the sight back to the store and they sent it to EOTECH for ""repair"".
After this sight came back, the battery life while sitting in the safe doing nothing was greatly improved, lasting a number of months.
I can't provide you an exact battery life while the unit sits in the safe but it is now at least 3 or 4 months. But by around 8 months, you can expect the batteries to be dead.
So, the sight is designed for combat, its designed to be used and the operator is expected to put fresh batteries in it as needed. It's not designed to sit in a safe for 8 months at a time.

There are two arrow buttons on the back of the unit, facing the shooter. [DOWN]    [UP]
The UP arrow turns on the unit.  
Once the unit is on, keep pushing the up arrow to increase the brightness of the holographic sight.
The down arrow dims the holographic sight the more you push it. 
Push both buttons at the same time to turn off the unit.

The sight is in mint condition because it sat in the safe for its whole life and only went to the range long enough to sight in the rifle it was attached to.
I also bought a stretchy cover for the sight which feels like it is made from wet suit material.
The sight easilly bolts on to any picatiney rail system using an allen wrench.
Easy adjustments for elevation and windage.

New EOTECH 512's (are no longer made but are still available) go from $375.00-$475 depending on where you shop.
Asking $325.00"

This gun has been accurized by hill country firearms. I hate to sell but I need the cash. I am asking 750OBO and this will include 100 hornady once shot brass I have bought. I will ship but prefer Face to Face. Here is some information on the BOSS system.



What is the BOSS? 
Browning's Ballistic Optimizing Shooting System (BOSS) is a patented breakthrough in rifle accuracy. When any rifle is fired, the barrel goes through a series of vibrations as the bullet leaves the muzzle. The variations of these vibrations greatly affect the accuracy of the rifle. Controlling these vibrations will greatly control the accuracy of the rifle. Browning's BOSS allows you to control the vibrations of your barrel so you can shoot groups you didn't think possible.

How the BOSS works. 
The BOSS simply tunes the vibrations of your barrel. This allows the bullet to leave the barrel the split second it is stationary. Your BOSS manual has a list of settings for each caliber and bullet weight. Adjusting your BOSS to these ""Sweet Spot"" settings allows you to find the instant your barrel is stationary. The result is accuracy never achieved before by an out-of-the-box rifle."

Quoted straight from Nighthawk's website:

""The Centurion was designed for the IDPA shooter to give you the advantage of a smoother draw. The Centurion has sewn in sight tracks and a reinforced mouth to give you the fastest draw possible in a leather holster. It is constructed from premium cowhide and is hand boned for better fit and retention. The reinforced mouth allows for the easiest one handed draw and re-holsters. While it is designed primarily for range work it is still comfortable and concealable enough for every day carry. The straight drop prevents elbow problems from repeated draws.""
