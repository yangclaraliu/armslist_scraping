The Grip Pod is authentic mil-spec.  This rifle is awesome and this is not a fire sale.  If you would like to purchase a serious weapon here locally with no paperwork, at a fair price, shoot me an email.  My price for everything is $4000, but if you don't want the scope or other furniture we can negotiate."

Since then two of the tires have gone flat and the battery is probably about dead. You’ll need to tow it away. But it won’t take much to get it back on the road. The Interior is in good shape, just a few dash cracks in the foam (you can get a new one cheap) and a tear on the front seat above the drivers back.

The 2214 is one of the favorite 22 handguns of 2214 due to its small size while maintaining great accuracy and its rarity as it is no longer in production, however factory parts are available through S&W.   With the size it makes for a great CC, backup or learner handgun for a younger shooter.

Fair/Good condition, 400 big block (351m400), only 140,000 original miles, still has a lot of power. It needs tires and a tune up. The car was running good when parked less than a year ago. Since then two of the tires have gone flat and the battery is probably about dead. You’ll need to tow it away. But it won’t take much to get it back on the road. The Interior is in good shape, just a few dash cracks in the foam dash pad (you can get a new one cheap) and a tear on the front seat above the drivers back. The outside is on ok shape with minimal rust, it just needs a paint touchup and very little body work if any. All in all it’s a great starter project that wouldn’t need all that much to have a cool late era muscle car or one very cool low rider. Clean title in hand. Tinted windows, heat works great, ac works great, and original paper work."

There are guns currently manufactured under the High Standard (AKA Hi-Standard) name, but this blog entry is traveling back in time to touch on the old High Standard Derringer not made by this new company. For information on the old High Standard line of guns, we are grateful to have John Stimson’s High Standard Information Website. Go there to date your old guns, download manuals, or take part in forum discussions.

The original company produced these derringers from 1962 through 1984. There was a time when this derringer was de rigueur among the well heeled. Many felt this design was “the derringer done right.” Easy to conceal, they are thin guns but not petite; they have 3 ½’’ over-under barrels and a fair sized grip. Having no awkward hammer to thumb-cock before firing, its double action makes two shots available as fast as you can squeeze the trigger. According to this site, for many years the Louisiana State Police purchased the .22 magnum version of this derringer as backup guns for the troopers.

Unlike on most pistols, the grip-panels serve no mechanical function; they can be removed to provide an even flatter carry. Some shooters find the shape of the grip-frame awkward. As an alternative, provided it is not long enough to extend past the end of the barrels, instead of using your index finger for the trigger try placing it alongside the barrels and using your middle finger for the trigger.

With aftermarket butler creek folding stock and one factory 20 rd magazine. $525.00
 I do not have the original wood stock that came with the rifle.  I am not the original owner but I have owned the rifle since the late 1980s.  I have probably fired less than 1,000 rds with it.  The original finish was blue but I had it refinished with Teflon
(color light sandy brown) sometime in the late 1980s.  I have three extra original factory Ruger magazines (2 twenty and 1 thirty) that I will sell for extra cash. ($20.00 each for the twenty round and $25.00 for the thirty round magazine).
So if you want everything the total due will be $590.00 cash.  (Price is firm with no wiggle room).  I am unable to send any pictures by camera or phone.  Otherwise I would have put them in the ad!  I am not interested in any trades at this time.  I prefer a face to face meeting.  I would rather not ship."

One of the icons of this class of weapon is the Springfield Armory M6 Scout Survival Rifle. 

The Springfield M6 Scout covers a variety of needs in both normal and emergency situations. Improved and updated from the original U.S. Air Force M6 Survival Rifle, the Springfield M6 Scout is a tough, reliable rifle you can depend on. 

Minimal moving parts 
Extreme durability 
Simple operation 
Exceptionally Reliable

The M6 was a standard component of survival kits for Air Force aircrews beginning in the 1950s through the early 1970s. The upper barrel is chambered for a .22LR round. The lower barrel is chambered for a 3"" .410 shotgun shell. 

The hammer is manually cocked, the barrel is manually selected and an oversized trigger accommodates easy firing – even with a gloved hand. 

An ammo magazine built into the stock, and secured by a locking cover, holds an emergency supply of .410 shells (4) and .22 cartridges (15). 

The M6 Scout features a folding stock which is easily detached via a quick-release pivot pin.  An M6 breaks down in less than 5 seconds to a very compact overall length of 18"", providing easy storage on a boat, small plane, tractor or recreational vehicle (check local laws regarding storage).  A specially designed trigger guard allows conventional finger firing, or full hand firing while wearing mittens or heavy gloves and weighs about 4lbs. 

This one is in very good condition. I do not have a case for it but they are available online at http://www.bodermansports.com/Firearms/Springfield_Armory/M6_Scout/m6_scout.html .

If you are looking for a survival weapon, the M6 should be at the top of your list!

I bought it new 30 years ago and it's Still Like New Savage/Stevens 67 Series E 12ga. Pump

Selling my Savage/Stevens Model 67 Pump Shotgun in 12ga. These were made starting in 1981 and discontinued from production in 1989.  I am the original owner and purchaser and bought it in 1983 when I was working for Whites Home and Auto Stores, right here in Albuquerque.  It is a deep blue with a walnut stocks.  Strongly built with a steel receiver, 3"" chambers and 5 shot tube magazine. Barrel length is 28"" with a fixed modified choke system.  (no plastic here) I never used it to hunt and it has lived in either a gun display case or now my safe all its life.  I have only fired one or 2 boxes of shells through this shotgun and if you look at the bolt it looks as if it has never been shot.  It is chambered in 2.75"" and 3"".  I have never fired a magnum shell or a slug through the barrel and it looks as new.  I am including all my old shells that I have with a few rifled slugs in the mix (75 to 85 in all).  I have a cleaning rod, brush and patches for cleaning that I will include.  This is a great shotgun that has been well care for and is as close to 100% as you can get without being new.  You are buying a 30 year-old shotgun from the man who bought it new! 

Getting rid of my 12ga. stuff except for home defense.  Would make a great Christmas gift for that young hunter or shooter.  

Asking $300 for everything or best reasonable cash offer.  Would consider a nice 410 pump in trade or what do you have???"

Some history about Union Switch and Signal: Union Switch & Signal company of Swissvale Pennsylvania, primarily made railroad signaling equipment but received a contract on May 5, 1942 for the manufacture of 200,000 M1911A1 pistols. The first pistols were accepted by Ordnance inspectors in January 1943, but the company received word that their contract would be canceled, due to a severe drop in requirements for the pistol. Within a month U.S.&S. had signed a contract to supply carbine parts. On March 8, 1943 the company was officially notified that their contract had been cut back from 200,000 pistols to 30,000 pistols. However on June 26th, when the contract was nearly complete, and many of the workers had been transferred to Carbine operations, the company received a letter of intent to purchase an additional 25,000 pistols. The last of the pistols was shipped on November 27, 1943. 55,000 Union Switch and Signal pistols were delivered serial numbered from 1041405 to 1096404 with peak production reaching 650 pistols a day. U.S.&S. pistols are the second rarest of the M1911A1s (55,000 produced), only the Singer is rarer (500 produced). None of the Union Switch & Signal 1911A1s have the crossed cannons ordnance stamp even thought the practice was standardized in late 1942. Also most of the early pistols up through about serial 1060100 received no “P” proof on the slide and frame. From about 1060100 to about 1082000, the “P” proof was applied, but at the Left edge of the slide where the curved part meets the flat. This was due to a poorly drawn ordnance drawing showing the placement of the proof. From about 1082000 to the end of production, the “P” was placed in its normal location on the top of the slide (center in front of rear sight). When the ""P"" proof mark is found it will be on both the slide and receiver and be of the same size. Notice the ""P"" proof stamp is smaller then Colts but still an uppercase letter.

The number of different machining operations performed by US&S on the parts for the pistol, was 600. These required the services of 658 different machines; 421 types of cutting and drilling tools; 239 different fixtures, and 447 different gages. While the Government owned the machines, gages and fixtures, US&S provided its own perishable tools. The receiver for each pistol underwent 106 individual operations, during which some four fifths of its weight was machined from the original forging.

Another interesting fact is the development of the US&S firing range, the design of which was later adopted by various pistol manufacturers including Colt. On the range each of the 55,000 pistols produced was test fired 21 times. Not a single pistol manufactured and assembled by US&S was rejected by the resident ordnance department inspector, of the 55,000 pistols fired by the US&S inspector before being passed to the Government Inspector, only two failed in one test. They were found to be completely automatic in action, firing seven shots with one trigger pull. US&S was consistently rated high in tests for Interchangeability of parts. The test was conducted once a month, the four producers of the pistol being required to send six pistols each to the key inspectors of the small arms pistol industry integration committee. The pistols were taken apart, the parts scrambled, and the 24 pistols re-assembled.

It is reported that Union Switch & Signal produced high quality pistols and did not experience the extreme production problems that Remington Rand and Ithaca had. The ordinance department reported the Union Switch & Signal pistols had a superior finish and consistently rated high in the interchangeability tests. According to the Springfield Research database a lot of these pistols were shipped to the Navy and the OSS.

This early example has the P on both the slide and receiver which is unusual. It was not acceptable for one reason or another and sent to the Salvage Crib to correct the malfunction. This happened to many pistols, and is only noticeable on this one because of the late date of adopting the P. There were so many, for example Ithaca sometimes had 10% or more, they became backlogged and often took several weeks or longer to get repaired depending on the severity of the problem. By the time this pistol was submitted or resubmitted for acceptance the P proof mark had been adopted. This pistol is a very collectible oddity"

This rifle holds around 15 rounds of .22 LR, and up to 22 rounds of .22 short, just in the magazine tube!

The 527 rifle series started production in 1954, with its design based on the Remington 870 shotgun. This rifle is extremely reliable, and it has been in my family since it was purchased in the 1960's. The manufacture of this exact rifle took place in June of 1964.
This .22 is specifically the Fieldmaster series, which means a lot of the parts are made of aluminum (Kind of like a Model 70 Featherweight). The total weight comes in at just 4 pounds.
This rifle is in perfect working condition, I guarantee that (or money back within 1 week of sale). It is fairly accurate, I've never bench-rested it, but at 50 yards it'll nail pop cans every time.

I'd say the finish is at about 98% as well.

I have better pictures I can email upon request.

I am heading to Tacoma tomorrow, and I'll be in western WA for until Sunday (4/7) at 5PM, but otherwise I'm in Pullman if you want the rifle."

That other fellow originally had his listed at 400, and when it didn't sell after a few weeks dropped his price to 360 (with holster and ammo).  If you have a mint, early Rossi 720C with unfluted cylinder and bobbed hammer I'll pay you 500 for it, which is well above blue book value.  If you have a later Interarms Rossi 720C with fluted cylinder, I'll pay you 460, also well above blue book value.  Will pay extra for any hard to find .44 Special factory ammo you might have.
