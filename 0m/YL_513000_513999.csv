The M3X utilizes a Xenon bulb that delivers a peak output of 125+ lumens and is protected by the Shock Suppression System which is designed to handle the heavy recoil demands of today
The M3 has been the gold standard in weapon mounted illuminators since it was first introduced in 1998. With a reputation for rugged reliability, the M3 can be found in more law enforcement and personal defense holsters today than any other weapon light on the market.

Now equipped with a powerful LED for greater illumination and longer run time, the M3 LED delivers a peak output of 125+ lumens and is powered by two (2) 3V 123 lithium batteries (included). The M3 LED has a run time of two (2) hours.

The M3 LED mounts easily, without the aid of tools, utilizing Insight’s patented Slide-Lock® interface. Simply slide the unit onto the firearm’s rail and lock into place with the spring-loaded latch bar. Insight’s Slide-Lock interface is designed to fit most pistols. Please refer to the Fit Chart for your specific firearm model.

The ambidextrous rocker switch located on the removable backplate allows the M3 LED to be activated in either a Momentary On or Constant On mode. The rocker backplate on the M3 LED is interchangeable with any other backplate designed for either M3 or M6 models, and optional long gun and shotgun backplates with integrated remotes are available providing for greater versatility in illuminator application.
Specifications:
•  Peak Output: 125+ Lumens
•  Run Time: 2 Hours
•  Interface Options: Slide-Lock®
•  Dimensions: 3.4”L x 1.6”W x 1.5”H
•  Weight: 3.3 oz. w/Batteries
•  Lithium Battery Power: 6V from Two (2) 123 Batteries
•  Warranty: Limited Lifetime Manufacture Warranty

It has a 350 crate engine in it with 5000 miles on it with chrome valve overs and air cleaner, also has new turbo 350 transmission with same mileage. This Vette has the Gymkhana suspension package from the factory. This Vette also came with PL, PW, PS, and factory alarm system. Other options include the deluxe interior and factory positive traction rear differential with 3.42 gears. I just recently installed a AC compressor and converted it over to R134A, but it still does not blow cold like it should. I also just had a alignment done on it, fresh tune up and oil change. The car has headers with true dual exhaust with catalytic converters. This car has a fresh emissions test done on it, and passes with flying colors. I have also installed a Accel super coil for the HEI, and have a Weiand Stealth aluminum intake manifold that will go with the car, as will as a set of roller tip rockers and a Comp cams muther thumper cam. I have 3 different tops for the car which include a set of mirrored glass T-tops that are in great shape, a set of fiberglass T-tops that need to be painted to match the car, and a convertible style soft top. The car runs great and is in pretty good shape inside and out, especially for a 33 year old car. I just had the original paint buffed and waxed, so it looks pretty good. I have the factory Rally wheels that will go with the car as well. The car has a pretty nice JVC CD player with MP3 and Ipod hook up. It is pretty fun to drive with a nice firm fast shift from the new transmission, and pretty good acceleration. This car actually gets pretty good gas mileage, but I also do not have a heavy foot. I am asking 5000.00 O.B.O for this pretty nice Corvette. I am also interested in trades of equal value. My name is Matt and my number is REDACTED. I am not in a hurry to sell so please no low ball offers. The only reason for selling is to many projects, so the room would be nice to have. I also do not need any help from scammers selling it, and kind of scammers will not get a response at all. Thanks for looking and have a nice day."

The Smith & Wesson Model 10, previously known as the Smith & Wesson Military & Police or the Smith & Wesson Victory Model, is a .38-caliber revolver developed from the Smith & Wesson .38 Hand Ejector Model of 1889. In production since 1899, it is a fixed-sight, six-shot handgun with a fluted cylinder. Over its long production run it has been available with barrel lengths of 2 in (51 mm), 3 in (76 mm), 4 in (100 mm), 5 in (130 mm), and 6 in (150 mm). Barrels of 2.5 inches (64 mm) are also known to have been made for special contracts. Some 6,000,000 of the type have been produced over the years, making it the most popular centerfire revolver of the 20th century."

It is now possible to replace your worn out piston spring with a top-quality replacement. They were manufactured with top quality CNC equipment, made in the USA. Chrome silicon is simply a better material for this application. It lasts much longer and resist wear better, even at higher temperatures. These particular springs were manufactured by spring engineers at a ISO 9001 certified manufacturing facility. The old and warped springs have been known to fail, causing bent and/or jammed pistons, especially with hotter ammo. If your piston spring is distorted, it won't absorb energy correctly. I offer a 100% money back guarantee. If you are not satisfied with the product, simply return the spring to receive your refund. I am confident that you will be satisfied. $13 shipped first-class. I also have VZ 58 firing pins, strikers, piston, extractors, AK47 Russian firing pins and extractors, AK74 Russian firing pins and extractors....PM me if interested, or email me at REDACTED"

The P229® is one of the most popular law enforcement pistols available today. Its nearly indestructible design outlasts, and out performs, other pistols so much so that after extensive testing with over 3,000,000 rounds fired, the Dept. of Homeland Security’s office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) selected the P229 over pistols from five other major manufacturers. Now the P229 is the standard duty pistol for not just DHS but also the U.S. Coast Guard, and is carried by other federal agencies that we aren’t permitted to discuss."

This vest is comfortable and perfect for duty work or even if you're just a businessman who totes around goods or money. It will stop up to SMG 9mm and carbine .44 mag.

Also, we have tested the ability of used (our test piece was out of an 03 military vest) and it was able to withstand six slicing cuts, eight stab cuts with minimal penetration, and three rounds out of a 9mm pistol with a 4.5"" barrel at just three or four feet away. The armor did fail on the fourth round at that distance when it was impacted within less than an inch of another round, but it didn't exit with very much power."

These handy low-profile clips were designed to be attached on the rail, against optics, lasers and other MIL-STD-1913 mounted accessories, providing a quick-index to return to the same point...especially in the dark. Each set comes complete with 72 total clips, 60 regular and 12, designed to hold tapeswitch wires along the rail's edge. LaRue IndexClips are easy to install, and stay-put until pried off (a Dillo's foot works really well for this). Several clips in a row can be used to protect a length of rail, and feature a non-slip surface."

Comes with everything that came in the box except for the original grips...  Holster, double mag holster, blank Warranty Card (You can fill it out and send it in if needed), etc...

I have installed an Ed Brown one piece guide rod and plug and some nice VZ10 grips.  The original two piece guide rod and plug come in the box with the pistol.  The original grips are not included since a (tard) buddy of mine dropped his Series 70 and broke a chunk out of his grip.  I felt sorry for him and gave him the original grips off this gun.  I'm generous like that....

I'm not hard to get along with and not too demanding.  If you want this fine pistol, I'll need to see your NCDL, your NC CHL, or see a Pistol Purchase Permit.  And I'll be needing some cash.

I don't require a bill of sale, but if you want one, that's not a problem.  I don't mind if you jot down my info, just don't expect to make photocopies of all my DL and CHL.  I'm legal.  If you're here scouting ArmsList, I hate it for you if you aren't.  I'm a law abiding kinda guy, but I don't expect you to jump through a bunch of hoops that are not required by law to make your purchase.  I don't expect I'll be doing that to make a sale.



Thanks for your time and here's some pics of a fine pistol I have for sale...

If you want more detailed pics of specific areas of the pistol, just email me and I'll do my best to get them to you in a timely matter.  You can tell from the pics I've got here that I'm more of a farmer than a photographer."

If you need a vintage amp more than your firearms, don't let this opportunity to own a piece of musical history get away from you! - - These amps can trade in excess of $1,000.  I'm not greedy and am valuing the amp at 600 bucks - PLEASE,  make your trade offers comparable...I didn't just fall off the turnip truck (unrealistic trade offers will simply be ignored)!  Trades can be equal, up or down with cash difference, I'm flexible....Semper Gumby!

It is the Bushmaster AR-15 ""XM15-E2S"" (they put that model number on all their AR-15 rifles), it is called an ""AK Carbine"" due to the AK-74 muzzle brake/compensator on the barrel.  It is an A3 style carbine (flat top upper with picatinny rail) and it has an EXTREMELY HARD TO FIND, 14.5"" HEAVY BARREL (the 14.5"" HBAR is only ONLY Found on the M4A1 Carbine, which is only assigned to SOCOM units due to the fact it is select fire (full auto) and has a heavy barrel more adept at sustained fire and accuracy.  It then has the Bushmaster's AK-74 compensating muzzle brake which is known over the world as *the best* muzzle device for eliminating muzzle climb (people call it 'barrel flip' sometimes) and reducing recoil.  A semi-auto AR-15 shooting .223 already is very light recoiling and small muzzle rise, but with this AK-74 brake on it, we're talking about the level of .22LR or below.  This was designed for Soviet Army conscripts from across the empire, some illteraite and never held a weapon before, to be abl to take their 5.45 AK-74s and fire them on full-auto, emptying magazines, with absolutely no recoil or muzzle rise to spoil the shots (And waste the comrades ammo.)

The best part is, after getting this extremely unique Bushmaster (It was a special edition limited made for Bushmaster's #1 retail account in the summer of 2010) I gave it a total Magpul package. As NJ residents know, it's extremely hard to find NJ compliant rifles because of NJ's arcane laws.  A lot of companys will make CA and NY compliant but NJ is the lone state that STILL absolutely bans the ""flash hiding"" muzzle devices (90% of all muzzle devices sold are being called flash hiders), the state allows absolutely NO FORM of stock adjusting (We can't collapse, retract, expand, fold, etc. the stock) and of course THE EVIL BAYONET LUG!!  So the Magpul made rifles which are the most popular forms of AR15 on the planet now, *EVERY SINGLE* manufacturer is rushing to make Magpul/MOE eiditions, well we ain't getting them.

So I painstakingly bought each and every piece and did it at high cost, and had a gunsmith build me a custom Magpul carbine.  In Magpul Olive Drab Green, I have the Magpul CTR (Compact, type restricted) high end stock, pinned professionally and 'permanently' to comply with the law, one spot open from fully closed, the Magpul MOE (Magpul Original Equipment) pistol grip, the Magpul MOE Enhanced Trigger Guard, the Magpul MOE Hand Guard, the Magpul MVG (magpul vertical grip), the Magpul MBUS rear sight (MBUS- Magpul Back Up Sight) which folds flat for optics use and deploys with a snap of the push-button, and 3 spare pic rails on the hand guard with Magpul XTM rail cover panels protecting them until you need them (IF you want to attach say a torch ie. a Streamlight weapons light, a Laser designator,  A Bipod etc.).  - In addition, when the expensive Magpul CTR stock was professionally installed, staked, and pinned, I had a CQD rear single point sling attachment, which has two attachment points on one side and a third on the other side...This was a replacement for the stANDARd stock end plate and another $56 bucks.

(^^ In this picture, there is 3 of my firearms, the top is a shotgun, the bottom is my S&W M&P 15-22 .22LR AR, the Bushmaster in this sale is in the middle. Note it is shown photographed with things NOT being included in this sale, as in but not limited to the Magpul magazines, a sling, and particularly the Aimpoint Micro red dot sight.  But it does show you all the OD Green Magpul furniture and accessories and shows the beauty of the rifle)

I bought this rifle for $1050 (and I got a deal being son of law enforcement) and I put min $500 worth of Magpul & accessories into it, plus had a gunsmith professionally pin and stake the stock, and then go over the rifle for safety and smoothness.  It has basically NEVER BEEN FIRED, the gunsmith put a few rounds through, and then we fired maybe 5 rounds when we zero'd the AImpoint.  I then put it away for Zombies.  The absolutely worst wear and wear it has is a scratch or two on the OUTSIDE of the rifle, from a screw driver when it was brand new and I was doing the accessories and upgrades myself.  After the scratch I said, forget this, I want this perfect and pristine, time to pay a professional.

So having at least $1550 in it plus magazines and ammo I will take $1350 cash and will include the hard case, a few magazines, and a few hundred rounds of steel cased ammo. REDUCED TO $1200 LETS MAKE IT QUICK

FURTHER REDUCED TO $1100. THIS IS THE LAST TIME I am reducing the price on this. I will be keeping it up for the weekend and the end of the weekend I will just take this dowm and keep it. If its not sold by Monday I'll take it as a sign I shouldnt sell it s this,is it. If you want now is the time and best price, it's literally almost brand new , barely never fired , and completely customized /Magpul'd < MORE, MAGPUL than regular states with Magpul edition rifles you can order. 

Here are some more good Pics I just took.

(^ Says the markings, B for Bushmaster , MP for Magnetic Particle [certifying it's a Bushmaster barrel and it's been inspected properly and highly], 5.56 NATO [so it's safe to use both military 5.56 NATO rounds and commercial .223 Remington], 1/9 means the barrel twist rate is 1 turn in 9 (which is arguably IDEAL... Many people swear up and down 1/7 which is Colt and the Milspec.. but remember, the Military rifles *** WILL NEVER*** Shoot ammo below 62 grains.  This kind of takes no account of the fact, 55 grain IS BY FAR THE MOST PREVALENT, AVAILABLE, CHEAPEST, ETC>...  and 62 GR Penetrator M855 is not necessarily want you'd WANT for shooting in your house for Home Defense, shooting around your neighborhood in case of emergency, CERTAINLY NOT at a lot of ranges.  And most people agree, that 1/9 will stabilize all but the HEAVIEST 5.56 ammo, and those 77 grain loads are extremely expensive, and designed SPECIFICALLY for the Mk 12 SPR (Special Purpose Rifle) sniper system, designed for SOCOM units to have a 5.56 accurizing ""sniper rifle"" in the designated marksman role, which could be carried and fought with as well as used for supporting sniper fire roles... and you probably wouldn't be shooting 77 gr Mk 262 $1-2$ a pop ammo out of this Bushmaster anyway.  If you ARE, you're looking at the wrong rifle entirely.

-- UPDATE- I am attempting to get out of this caliber and concentrate on ""family calibers"" - Therefore, instead of $1200 CASH, I would take a new rifle (Specifically an Arsenal SGL-24 7.62x39mm) and $400 cash... This would allow you to pay the vast majority of this on a credit card , and just give the small amount in cash.  Please contact me if you're interested"

931,http://www.armslist.com/posts/513931,"For Sale/Trade:  CMMG 16"" M4 22 Barrel w/ SS Collar for Dedicated Upper","SW Springfield, Springfield, Missouri",$ 110,"Listed On: Saturday, August 18, 2012",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a very lightly used CMMG 16"" M4 .22 Barrel w/ Stainless Steel Collar, drilled for A2 front sight base pins. I have put about 300 rounds down this barrel and have had very good accuracy. 

If you have a 22 conversion kit from CMMG, use this barrel to build your dedicated upper. From what I have read, your typical 5.56/223 barrel has an inside diameter of .224 inches, 22LR best performs with a .222 inch barrel, thus you will get much better performance from a dedicated upper with this barrel (I.D. .222"") than with using your 223. And not to mention you don't run the risk of clogging up your chamber or gas chamber with 22lr soot. 

I am getting rid of this simply because it is not being used and it just sits in my safe. The barrel and SS collar run $160 from CMMG plus shipping. I am offering this deal for $120 and with potential to be cheaper (read ahead) 

Potential trade: If you have the 223 conversion kit with the chamber adapter for 223/5.56 and you are upgrading to a dedicated upper. Throw in your chamber adapter (that looks like a 223 case sticking out the front) and I will give you a fair discount (depending on the material of the chamber adapter - i.e. stainless or parkerized). 

Here is some info from CMMG's website: Convert your 22-ARC into a dedicated upper! Add an upper receiver and replace your chamber adapter with the barrel adapter collar and you have a dedicated .22 LR upper. 16"" barrel. 1/2x28 threaded muzzle. Stanless Steel dedicated chamber adapter with ball detent*.

Gun is solid stainless steel and made in Texas by American craftsmen. All barrels from Bond Arms are interchangeable with all frames so you can add any calibers you wish with the removal of one allen screw. Changing barrels takes less than one minute. This is my primary conceal carry gun. If you spend alot of time outdoors hunting, fishing, camping, etc the 410 works perfectly for any slithering or 4 legged critters you may encounter. For self defense the 410 or 45 Long Colt will stop any 2 legged varmints.

If you need a quality guitar more than your firearms, don't let this opportunity to own a gorgeous 'Strat' get away from you! - - This model can trade close to $1,000. I'm not greedy and am valuing it at 600 bucks - PLEASE, make your trade offers comparable...I didn't just fall off the turnip truck (unrealistic trade offers will simply be ignored)! Trades can be equal, up or down with cash difference, I'm flexible....Semper Gumby!
