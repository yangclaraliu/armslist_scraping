Thank you 
please note my location is ""Roseburg Oregon"", approximately an hour and 20 minutes below Eugene and two hours above Medford. Arms list does not offer Roseburg as a location to post ads. My price is 275 dollars for the gun. If you are local to me and or willing to come here i would be willing to dicker some but since i paid $299 and they're now $329 for the synthetic model i dont feel its a terrible price for a practically new gun. Also realize even if you do pay my asking price its not worth it to me to spend 40time dollars on gas plus my time to drive it to you. I can assure you it is an excellent shot gun that will last you for years to come. It may seem ridiculous i havr wrote so much in here but im sick of being offered 200me dollars for a almost new firearm and at the same time asked to drive 3 hours to deliver it.

I have other 32 revolvers, and they are fun to shoot. They don't have the recoil of a 38, but they have the ""knockdown power"" of a 38. They are good for a woman that is ""recoil sensitive"" They will shoot 32 short, 32 long, and 32 magnum. For a carry gun, you can't beat this gun. It weighs a mere 10 oz.

NO TRADES

A complete AK shooter's tactical package, consisting of: 
â¢            A Norinco Mak 90 that has been converted from it's import ""sporting"" configuration.  The Chinese Norinco and Polytech weapons are a higher quality manufacture than is normally found in typical AKâs, with a thicker receiver stampings and chrome lined barrels. Weapon has had the original thumb-hole sporting stock and hand guard replaced with a steel Romanian folding stock, and Tapco SAW grip and Galil-style composite hand guard. This rifle is 922r compliant, and the work was done in Dec.of 2010.
Additional upgrades include:
â¢	Ultimak railed gas tube assembly.
â¢	Tapco G2 trigger, tuned.
â¢	Custom phantom-style threaded flash hider (14x1 LH metric, standard AK thread).
â¢	Meprolight tritium night sights, rear notch and front post.





The gun has a Primary Arms red dot sight (PA Micro-Dot MD-07) mounted that co-witnesses with the iron sights, and also a Surfire 6PX 200 lumen tactical light mounted in a Vltor light mount. Both are mounted solidly to the Ultmak rail. There is no wobble or play to be found anywhere, everything is rock solid. This gun has seen limited range time after the work on it was done, so all upgraded components are in new condition, or nearly so. With the red dot I am able to keep all my shots in a 5â circle at 100 yds. benched, and I am not the best shot. I am sure it could do better in the right hands. This gun runs smooth and shoots true. Zero malfunctions in the approx. 500 rounds that I have shot through it.

This package is completed with a total of 11  30 round steel magazines, near new UTG Covert ballistic nylon case, new Blackhawk AK chest rig, 550 rounds of Tulammo 122 gr. steel case hollow point (320 rounds in original packaging, 330 rounds loose), and 2 unopened cases (2000 rounds) of Golden Tiger 124 gr. FMJ ammunition. Total of 2550 rounds of ammunition altogether, valued at approximately $650.00.

The price for this complete AK package is $2000 cash, FTF only. I am not interested in breaking it up at this time. Because of restrictions on shipping ammo this offer is only for a FTF transaction in the Portland OR area. Email me if you have any questions. Serious inquiries only, please.

This is a beautiful early .22 revolver, the serial number indicates it was made in 1957.  It has some marks on the barrel, but no rust or corrosion, just signs of good, honest wear.  Mechanically it's in perfect condition, locking up tight like a Smith should, with an amazing crisp trigger that's perfect for hunting or target work.  These are beautiful guns that function well above expectations.

This K-22 is fitted with a Leupold 2-power pistol scope, M8-2X.  The scope was sent to the Leupold factory for inspection and reconditioning in 2004.  I have the paperwork to verify this.  The scope is mounted to the pistol with a sturdy B-Square mount, especially made for S&W pistols.  It replaces the rear sight and clamps on the barrel in the front.  The original factory K-22 sight will be included.  As shaky as I am, I have experienced dime-size groups at 25 yards.  The gun has not been fired in years, but it's ready to go for small game or the target range.

The original factory wooden grips were replaced with oversize Pachmayr rubber grips which give better control for shooting.  The original grips will be included with the package.  The gun comes in a sturdy, lockable, carrying case, with the original grips and sights, and a complementary box of ammo.

You just can't get them like this anymore.  This pistol is very tight and a real nice shooter, and very collectable.  What a perfect gift it would make for someone special.  I'm asking $550 for this fine .22 revolver and scope package.  Contact me immediately so we can talk about this, and make an appointment for viewing."

- Integrated stylish trigger guard
- Flared magwell with cool curve shape

This gun is not in good shape. There is surface rust, the cylinder struggles to open, the hammer takes some jiggling to lock back, some of the screws are stripped and chewed up, and sometimes only 3 or 4 of the 5 chambers will fire. Simply put, this is not a good gun. That's why it's only 50 bucks. Maybe you need it for parts, or you need a backup for your good .357, I don't eally care why you need it, but it's yours for just 50 US dollars. I'm not willing to travel very far to sell a $50 gun, so I hope you're in the Fort Campbell/Clarksville/Hopkinsville area or are willing to travel here. Be prepared to show a valid KY ID or concealed carry permit and bring a crisp new $50 bill or 50 worn and crumpled $1 notes. Be prepared to fill out a firearms bill of sale."

The metal components are exactly those of the Russian AKM and they are built on Russian equipment and has a chrome-lined barrel. This Egyptian Maadi also has several upgrades including a quad rail, Vltor buffer tube, and Vltor EMOD stock. The buffer tube allows for any ar-15 stock to be used. There are also 2 sling attachment options on the rifle. It will come with a soft case, AKM manual, 3 30-round mags, 1 10-round mag, and about 250 noncorrosive hollowpoints.

This Glock gives you the recoil management, sight radius, and reliability of the G21 but with short grip concealability by reducing the grip length to that of the compact G30 and it's 10 round mags. The trigger pull has been reduced to a nice safe 4# pull. The recoil spring is of the simpler single 3rd Gen style with a tungsten guide rod. It is equipped with, new this year, Trijicon HD tritium sights. The front and rear of the grip has been stipled for better retention. The 10 round mags are great for carry but when at the range you can still run the full capacity 13 rounders. This Glock was an everyday carry so it does have some holster wear around the front of the slide. I'm asking $700, which is far less than the price of the build of a .45 like this. I am selling it with (1) 10 round mag and (2) 13 round mags. I do have more spare mags if interested. I am also open to trades so just let me know what you have in mind. (62zero)5one5-zero985"

This gun has only seen 100 rds at the range. comes with 2 magazines, one mag has +2 extender on it. 
The Glock 17L has a 6.03"" barrel designed for competition or target shooting, giving it a longer sight radius improving accuracy and adding weight, thus reducing recoil while adding velocity to the bullets. 
I purchased the gun with the Crimson Trace laser on it already, so I'm selling them together. The gun has had the firing pin safety and trigger arm polished to smooth the trigger, other than that the gun is completely stock. The polishing in no way effects the function or reliability of the gun, just makes the trigger smoother.  Gunsmith owned.

The finish is excellent, only very minor holster wear.  The East Germans are considered to be the finest manufactured Makarovs on the market.  The  fit and machining is of a quality you'd expect from a German shop, and they shoot like a dream.  The bore is bright and shiny, and the trigger is smooth, both in double and single action.

This Makarov comes with a black soft-leather military holster, complete with the correct cleaning rod.  An extra clip is included, and the pistol is enclosed in a sturdy plastic, lockable carrying case.

I'm including an almost-full box of Winchester ammo.  Premium defense ammo is available, making the Makarov a desireable concealed-carry weapon.

The Makarov is to Russia what the 1911 is to us here in the U.S.   It became the Soviet Union's standard military side arm from 1951-1991, and remains in widespread use even after being replaced by a more modern 9mm Yarygin pistol.  The Makarov is still the service pistol of many Eastern European and former Soviet republics.  The East German Makarovs are clearly C&R eligible because the country of manufacture, the GDR, no longer exists.

I'm asking $350 for this East German Makarov, with the accessories and ammo.  It's perfect for home or car protection.  This would make a great Christmas gift for someone special.  Perfect East German Makarovs are hard to find, so contact me immediately before this one gets away.  You will not be disappointed."
