Lasermax model LMS-1131p. For: GLOCK 19, GLOCK 23, GLOCK 32, GLOCK 38 (**Will NOT fit the new Gen4 GLOCK**)

Completely internal! Keep your current holster for your GLOCK, keep your tactical lights, keep your favorite grips.

Extremely rugged. The LaserMax Guide Rod Laser for GLOCK meets or exceeds both Mil-Spec and Homeland Security durability test standards (drop tests, blowing sand, temperature and humidity extremes, salt water fog, deep water immersion, 20,000+ rounds live fire).

Installation takes minutes. If you can field-strip your GLOCK, you can install your LaserMax Guide Rod Laser sight—No gunsmithing to your GLOCK required. 

Hi-Visibility Pulsating Beam. A pulsating laser beam gives effortless awareness of muzzle direction, and it transcends language barriers. It can be used outdoors from dusk till dawn, or indoors round-the-clock. Infra-Red versions are optimized for NVG characteristics.

Alignment. The Internal Guide Rod lasers for GLOCK come permanently aligned from the factory* for center-of-mass accuracy at 20 yards. It will never drift out of alignment. There is no need to re-zero after changing batteries.

Accuracy. As close to the bore of the GLOCK as possible, positioning allows for the closest and most consistent relationship between your point of aim and point of impact (POA/POI) over all shooting distances. Especially useful for moving targets.

Turn it on! Ambidextrous switch in custom take-down lever that very closely resembles the factory GLOCK take down lever. Deliberate on/off activation which is highly desirable in a tactical or personal defense situation!"

This shotgun is chambered for 2 /34 inch as well as 3 inch rounds.  It has the factory stock on it, but the sale of this firearm would also include the Knoxx Specops recoil reducing pistol grip stock and fore end.  Also, I would throw in an XS Tritium front sight, which is easily installed.  The Specops stock retails for around a hundred dollars, and the XS Tritium front sight is up around 40 or 50 bucks.  The exterior of the receiver, barrel, and mag tube have all been coated with tactical black DuraCoat which makes it virtually impervious to weather.
Only about 50 rounds have been fired through this shotgun, so it has decades of life left in it.  
If you're not interested in the Knoxx Specops stock or tritium front sight, I would sell the shotgun itself for $400.

I don't have the box. Installation is basically field stripping your glock and dropping the Lasermax in. These are $349 from the mfg, and $300 on EBay. Feel free to ask any questions. Thanks for looking. Also, I will through in what ever batteries I have. The following info came from the Lasermax site.


For: GLOCK 19, GLOCK 23, GLOCK 32, GLOCK 38 (**Will NOT fit the new Gen4 GLOCK**)

Completely internal! Keep your current holster for your GLOCK, keep your tactical lights, keep your favorite grips.

Extremely rugged. The LaserMax Guide Rod Laser for GLOCK meets or exceeds both Mil-Spec and Homeland Security durability test standards (drop tests, blowing sand, temperature and humidity extremes, salt water fog, deep water immersion, 20,000+ rounds live fire).

Installation takes minutes. If you can field-strip your GLOCK, you can install your LaserMax Guide Rod Laser sight—No gunsmithing to your GLOCK required. 

Hi-Visibility Pulsating Beam. A pulsating laser beam gives effortless awareness of muzzle direction, and it transcends language barriers. It can be used outdoors from dusk till dawn, or indoors round-the-clock. Infra-Red versions are optimized for NVG characteristics.

Alignment. The Internal Guide Rod lasers for GLOCK come permanently aligned from the factory* for center-of-mass accuracy at 20 yards. It will never drift out of alignment. There is no need to re-zero after changing batteries.

Accuracy. As close to the bore of the GLOCK as possible, positioning allows for the closest and most consistent relationship between your point of aim and point of impact (POA/POI) over all shooting distances. Especially useful for moving targets.

Turn it on! Ambidextrous switch in custom take-down lever that very closely resembles the factory GLOCK take down lever. Deliberate on/off activation which is highly desirable in a tactical or personal defense situation!"

It is a L.A.P.D. police patrol bike. 1 of 50 made for U.S. police departments. There were more but they were 5-speeds. It is a 1000cc V-twin with 23,000 miles and has Aftermarket exhaust with a nice rumble, not too loud because the removable baffles are still installed. It also has K&N Filters on it. It also comes with stock air box and filter and a box of other parts. It has linked hydraulic triple disk Brembo brakes. Shaft drive. This transmission has a torqueconverter just like a car instead of a clutch. With a manual clutch to shift gears. It is a two speed tranny. Leave it in high range all day and ride around like a scooter with no clutch or leave it in low range for city or more agressive riding. You only have to use the clutch to shift. You can also shift up and down all day like a normal transmission. I just installed a new stereo and speakers. I aslo have a brand new ventless wind shield to go with it and a matching trunk. This bike is a real treat to ride as I put a few thousand comfortable miles on it last season. I have a new set of dunlop 404 tires and tubes to put on it. A while back I was out on a ride and the bike quit charging. I thought it was the voltage regulator so I put a new one on. Turns out the stator is also bad. They are around $125 on line but I may order one soon if some money frees up. If you know any thing about Guzzi's than you know the only bike that will last as long as a Guzzi is an air head BMW. As with most guys with toys, I get bored and want something new. Please do your research on this before you contact me. If you have any questions or want to send me an offer, please call or text at 7 six 5-6 two 5-0 one 96. Thank you. $4,000.00 If you want to come check it out I can put a full charge on this bike and you take it for a test ride. Keep in mind this bike is worth much more with very little money spent. And you WILL have a smile on your face after a ride on this one. Worst I can say is no."

I ordered it with the heavy barrel instead of the M4 contoured barrel because it lasts longer and can have a much higher round count before it wears out. 

I've added a Hogue grip, Magpul rear BUIS, Badger Ordnance Tactical charging handle, Knight's Armament vertical fore grip and a Surefire Millennium Model-A dedicated weapon light/fore end. 

The gun sells new for $950 plus a $50 upgrade to the heavy barrel. Used and taken care of I figure it's still worth $850. I'm not one to try to say it's worth more for the add on's except in regards to the Surefire fore end because that's a $450 fore end. 

I'm looking to get $1,100 the way the gun sits but I will put the original fore end back on it and sell it for $850 as well.

I will consider handguns on trade for about half of the value but I've got to get around $600 cash. The only revolvers I will consider is a Taurus Judge or Smith and Wesson Governor.

It is literally just a baby as it barely has any rounds down the pipe. In fairness to the EMP, I did shoot 2 P229 Elite Sigs and had a FTE on each so my guess is that the ammo I was using was definitely a factor.

I do know it shoots well and locks up tighter than a bank vault.  It's in good condition with some patina on the cylinder along with a few dings and scratches that you can see. This pistol is a GREAT shooter that'll last you years to come. All I've shot through this thing was some mild 158gr .38s and while it's VERY accurate it's just not for me.
