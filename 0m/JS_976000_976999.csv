Rest assured your guns and ammo sit in your man cave fully secured and hiding in plain sight. 

This is custom built, fully carpeted with grey carpet, adjustable magnetic barrel rest for long and short guns. This safe can hold many guns in its current configuration. The safe is very well built, incredibly sturdy with lock and key.  It is equipped with a set of three - 3 LED lights that really light up and show off the quality inside. The outside (Exterior) has been cleaned and looks just like a regular pop machine. I replaced all the labels with brand new labels. The side decals are not in perfect condition and have scratches and I have included pictures. I have wired the machine to be able to be plugged into any standard 110V outlet so it looks like the machine is on and running. Sand can be added into the lower level or the machine can be bolted down to your floor for security. A lot of time, work and money went into this safe and it is very nice looking. I’m asking 500.00. Email with any questions. Thanks"

All 50 projectiles are unused, the box was opened in order to see the projectiles.  I'd like them to go to someone who can use them as opposed to them sitting on my shelf, unused.  I can send more photos as needed.  $30 for the projectiles and that includes shipping costs.  These are backordered at most places.  I am not trying to make a buck on these, so I posted a couple webpages, to include Cabelas, to give you an idea of the normal price.

LIMITED SUPPLIES

We are a small independent distributor staffed by shooting enthusiasts who, because of the current ongoing situation, have decided to offer ammo direct to the shooting public at a significant cost savings over current prices. All orders will be on a first come- first serve bases and subject to availability.

Order Process:

 After you place an order via e-mail and we have met our minimum requirements with the supplier a container will be shipped to us.  These containers come in once or possibly twice per month. After it clears customs etc. and we know the shipment is en route to us we will contact you to arrange sending your payment.  We accept USPS Money Orders ONLY for shipped orders or, should you be close enough to collect in person, cash when you come to pick it up. We ship as soon as your payment and the ammo arrives with us.  YOU DO NOT PAY US UNTIL WE HAVE THE AMMO IN THE COUNTRY!  Because of the way we have to do business we cannot cancel your order once placed.  Occasionally we proactively over-order and should you wish to increase the quantities we will be happy to oblige but cannot guarantee we can do it each time you ask so order as many as you need up front. We shall not, however, short somebody else to give preferential treatment to one order.

Please include the following information in ALL orders:

1. Name and address of person ordering.

2. Phone number where you can be reached.

3. E-mail address.

4. Caliber and quantities you wish to order. (Be specific, no ""I thinks"" etc.) e.g. 9mm X 1K, .223 X 2K

The components that go to make ammunition are subject to the international commodities market and occasionally we will get hit at our end by unforeseen price increases so great we may have to increase the unit prices to you. Our pricing includes a small profit for us, if it did not we would soon go out of business, and all shipping and handling charges. All orders are subject to availability of the ammunition on the international market and pricing dictated by the manufacturer.

These 80 Percent AR-15 Lower receivers start as 7075-T6 forgings from the lead forge in the US and are fully machined to mil-spec tolerances.

These are anodized with a mil-spec type III hard coat anodizing. This is a not an FFL item. This is not a complete receiver and still requires machining to be done.

I believe The hammer activated firing pin is interchangeable with that of universally available G.I. M1911 A1 pistol firing pin and spring. The bolt is self cleaning for max reliability under adverse conditions. The extractor is large and positive to easily remove the most firmly stuck case. The trigger group is a modified M1 Garand type with improved braided stainless steel hammer spring. The simple D Max design allows the gun to be field stripped in seconds without tools. The side mounted magazine allows the shooters to take a lower position than with any other high cap carbine. It comes with one 30 round magazine. All exterior metal surfaces are parkerized and then given a ""MAX-Coat"" finish.  Get this rare Carbine before you can't  975.00 or trade"

Hey,
You need to get this out to EVERYONE you know that may have an interest to keep hi-cap magazines around, as Oregon Senate Bill 346 introduced on January 13th is looking to make it a crime to be able to purchase, even through private party, the sale of magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds.
> 
> Here is a link to the bill, and below that, a list of your state senators that you need to write/contact to stop this bill from being passed.
PLEASE e-mail your Senators,

It has a 351 engine, C6 automatic transmission. It has power steering and power brakes(so it stops very good unlike ones without power brakes). 

THE GOOD:
Fully rebuilt Holley 4 barrel carb
Has an Edelbrock performer intake
All new gaskets/seals minus the head gaskets
All new freeze plugs on the engine
New timing chain 
New water pump
New oil pump
New fuel pump
New stock cam
New coolant temp sending unit
New oil sending unit
New battery
New alternator
New HEI distributer
The seat has been recovered recently, the carpet looks new and the inside of the truck is clean. 
The truck has a bedliner with a chrome toolbox and bed rails.
The truck also has Michelin LTX M/S tires with aluminum wheels. 
The truck has a tow hitch and is wired for trailer lights.
The exhaust has a nice rumble to it.
The truck has a CD Player

THE NOT SO PERFECT:
Exterior of the truck has some non-major dents and dings.
The paint is chipped in a few places.
It could probably use a paint job before too long.
The A/C is not charged but everything is there to make it work, it came with factory A/C.
The timing is not adjusted 100% right. Once the truck get hot it turns over slow to crank, but it still cranks.
The power steering pump has a slight whine sometime while turning. The previous owner said he ran it low one time when a hose busted.
The plastic door panels on the interior are cracked.
The odometer is broken.

M1A  Scout - Pre Ban Unfired, Zero Rounds!  M1A  Scout Model 

AA9106 made in April 1994.  Front Sight Assembly is marked NM with Factory Flash Supressor, 18"" barrel, Black Factory USGI fiberglass stock (small storage rub mark see picture) and has a Blue Factory Trigger tag still attached to trigger guard.

Beautiful Springfield M1A Scout with TRW bolt. This Pre Ban rifle was manufactured in April 1994 with critical and precision USGI parts, military surplus parts, not commercial parts as the newer rifles. The serial number is 0800XX. This M1A Scout has not been fired, zero rounds.

Receiver is the recognized highest quality Valley Ordnance (Wilkes-Barre, PA) that was the company that did the machining on M1A receivers from 1971 until 1996 by the famous Melvin Smith.

Those who know M1A's have said ""Pre Ban M1A's in the 1990's had a preponderance of high quality forged USGI parts used in their construction and conventional wisdom says that SAI had the best quality receivers back prior to the ban. These are more than enough reason to pay a premium for a well preserved pre ban, over anything manufactured by them since 1994.""

I have 5 of these for sale. I'm asking $50 EACH with free shipping AND insurance OR BEST OFFER, I prefer to sell in multiples of 5. If I am shipping I will need a paypal payment or postal money order with tracking. If we are to meet face-to-face, it's cash and carry. What you see is what you get, these are BRAND NEW still in the bag. This is the newest generation, an improvement over most PMAGs.

From the website:

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

* Next-generation impact and crush resistant polymer construction

* Modified dimensions allow for wider compatibility with non Colt-spec platforms

* Constant-curve internal geometry for smooth feeding

* Anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability

* Long life USGI-spec stainless steel spring

* Over-travel insertion stop on the spine

* Ribbed gripping surface and new aggressive front and rear texture for positive magazine handling

* Paint pen dot matrix panels on the bottom of the body to allow for identification marking

* Flared floorplate aids magazine handling and disassembly yet is slim enough for use with many double and triple pouches

* Pop-off Impact/Dust Cover to minimize debris intrusion and for additional protection in storage and transit

* Made in U.S.A.

Again, if you offer $250 for all 5 with FREE shipping and insurance they are yours, done deal, or you can make an offer. Local face-to-face is also welcome.

I'm only interested in selling all 5 together, thanks."

Brand New AR-15 upper half in the 5.56/223 caliber. This is is a complete rifle. The barrel is 16"" M4 profile with the 1-7 twist. The receiver on the upper half is made from the durable 7075 forging which is mil-spec. The rail system on this upper is a free float 10"" modular rail system which allows the shooter to move the rails where it best suits their needs and makes it easier to grip with the smaller diameter. 

These rifles have been modified so that they will fire the military ammo flawlessly or whatever you may decide to feed it. This upper is extremely heavy duty. 
The upper was built by Precision Arms International in Alabama.
The lower is extremely heavy duty also being a complete Rock River Arms lower with a 6 position stock. 

I have two of these rifles and they have consecutive serial numbers from Rock River Arms and are identical.

I am selling these in Oklahoma City. I am asking $1700 each.

**I also have 5.56 and .223 ammo for sale for additional $ if you are needing that

I may trade for the right gun/guns. Just ask. All I can do is say no if I don't like the deal. Thanks for looking.
