This shotgun is around 30 years old and is in brand new condition. I believe the magazine is a 8+1. Great looking shotgun, not a problem with it.

Anyway he has a Blued Delta Elite in the original Box and Papers. Never used not a scratch or blemish anywhere on this fine Pistol. The Blue is like the Royal Blue of a Python. Don't take anything that may make it look anything but Pristine. Even the white dots are a Bright white like it was still at Colt waiting to be shipped. I'm not sure of the exact year of MFG. but the ser. # starts with DE033** so it was made in the low 3,000 production which shows about 1986 to 87. The camera used is 12 years old so the pics may not show the real beauty. If I were the Buyer I would buy it as an investment not a shooter as there has never even been a round in the Mag. and a Beauty like this doesn't come around often. The Owner has the Price fixed at 1275.00 firm. Please no offers of less than listed and at this time he's not interested in any Trades. Although he said the only trade he would make would be for an LAR GRIZZLY in 45 WIN MAG or 50 AE. You must have FL. ID. or a CWP for FL. and a Bill of sale will be drawn up. It seems I must say this again PLEASE do not waste your or my time with low ball figures. If you want to pay 900. to 1000.00 look for a Used Delta Not a New one with a low serial number. I will start to deleate any e-mails that are looking for quality for a cheap price. Look at a new Tangfolio, there only about 1,000 for a new model"

This is a preban NHM91 sometimes called the MAK91.  It features a 23"" heavy barrel with factory barrel mounted bipod. If you havent seen these Norinco factory bipods they are super cool.  This spring loaded heavy duty bipod swings out for use and snaps back for stow.  This gun is in great functioning condition and never has a single ftf or fte.  I shoot both surplus steel cased ammo and premium brass cased and never have the slightest hiccup.  The bore is great and the rifiling is strong.  This preban unit features a factory threaded barrel with Galil style muzzle brake.  This being a rare preban model it also still has the original bayonet lug.  This Norinco NHM91 has commonly been called an RPK type rifle due to its size and the additional factory mounted bipod assembly.

This is also a straight cut receiver which means that if you dont like the wooden thumbhole stock that different options are easy to interchange.  Also this rifle will take any standard AK magazines or drums.  Some NHM91s would only accept Chinese mags without slight modification.  This unit takes any mag you can put in a Wasr, or any other standard receiver 7.62x39.

I also have a Bulgarian Circle 10 drum magazine with 75 rd capacity I can include to even up a higher end trade.  This is a $200 drum not a $75 Korean drum."

Scope is a Tasco Custom Shop from the 90's made in Japan (These are the better ones, and no I don't know why...all steel I think?) It is 8-40x56. Yes, 40 power with two 3"" sunshades. Sorry for the generic pictures. The one with the purdy lady is mine.

The gun is all metal, and the charging handle really cycles. Just a shorter throw than the .223 awesome Umarex and Colt production."

It rotates 360° and has 2 self centering foam padded vises that adjust to any length weapon. The vises ride on opposed sets of rails with a wide range of angular adjustment. This allows an AR-15 upper receiver to pivot away from the lower receiver with both halves firmly secured. The rails supporting the vises can be angled upwards so that any gun, even with a scope can be securely inverted for working on the underside. As a bonus, a “V” notch gun support and padded platform are furnished so that the vise can be used for 3 – 5 shot sighting in or as a shooting rest. The platform can be angled to match the drop at the heel to provide more contact area for the butt stock.

Timing and action is excellent, and this is one of the few percussion revolvers that I’ve owned that actually shoots where you aim it – neither high or low – to the left or to the right. In overall excellent condition, its only flaw is that the barrel lug and wedge have been marred on the right side by the original owner who didn’t have a clue as to how to remove a tight barrel wedge from a revolver. This flaw is purely cosmetic and is more than made up for by its accuracy. In parts alone this gun is a two hundred dollar + value."

So I am listing these for sale again. I may consider trades as well. Multiple guns trades are ok. I have a variety of interests when it comes to firearms so please make offers. I will consider trades plus cash as well. It really just depends on what you have. I am an ak guy by heart but will consider other trades as well. Below is a list of all of the guns that I am offering for sale or trade. There is also a variety of ammunition for sale as well. I also have a very extensive and valuable collection of autographs for sale. This is my personal collection and I have put this collection together over the years. This is an amazing collection for any baseball fan. The total autograph collection is valued at over $20,000. I also have these items listed below. All of the autographs have proper documentation and certificates of authenticity. I prefer cash but I will consider trades on these items as well. My asking price for the entire collection is $5,500. However, I will consider any reasonable offer. I must sell these items rather quickly because I do not want the property that we are planning on purchasing to be sold. We really need the money for a larger down payment. I will consider trades and cash offers, but please be reasonable. Thanks for looking. 

GUNS: 

Custom Saiga 12 Guage Shotgun
Price: $1350
This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri mail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling mount, finger groove pistol grip, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga.

Winchester 94 AE Lever Action 30/30
Price: $425
This is a nearly prefect example of Winchester's famous lever action rifle. This 94 AE is chambered in 30/30 and has seen very little usage. I have fired this rifle very little and used it as a brush gun during hunting season only a few select times. This gun is in excellent condition and is the closest thing that you will find to new. 

Remington 770 30/06 bolt action rifle
Price: $325
I purchased this rifle a few years ago and never actually fired the rifle. I took it out one time with me hunting but never had the opportunity to fire it. This rifle is chambered in 30/06 and comes with a 3-9x40 scope mounted. The scope has never even been sighted in. It also has a camo sling mounted. This would make a perfect deer rifle for someone. 

DPMS AR-15 20"" A2 target rifle with stainless bull barrel
Price: $1,050
This rifle is the most accurate AR that I have ever shot. This is a DPMS AR-15 with an A2 stock and a 20 inch long, 1 inch diameter stainless bull barrel. This rifle has a free floating barrel and a free floating DPMS handguard, forward assist, and dust covers. The rifle also has a 6-24x44 scope that has not been sighted in. The scope has been mounted on a top rail scope mount. The rifle also has a bipod mounted. This rifle has a railed gas block and will come with two magazines as well. The stock has a few knicks and dings but nothing major. This came from shooting on a bench. The gun has been fired very little and hasn't been fired since I mounted the scope. 

Glock 22 40 S&W in OD Green
Price:$500
This is a brand new Glock and has never been fired. This is a Gen 3 glock and will come with two factory hi-capacity glock mags. I purchased this gun when I learned that Glock would no longer release any OD green glocks. I can include a blackhawk carbon fiber holster and two KCI extreme capacity glock mags for an additional $75. I believe they are 31 rounders but I am not positive. The last OD green gen 3 glock that was new in the box sold for over $500 with $25 shipping plus ffl fees on Gunbroker. This is going to be a collector's item very soon. Especially in unfired condition. 

Sig Sauer Platinum Elite 1911
Price:$1100
This is the most beautiful 1911 that you have ever seen. This pistol has never been fired. I purchased it about a year ago and placed it in my safe. This gun has night sites installed. Checkered grip, beavertail grip safety, and many other custom features. This is a beautiful pistol and would make an excellent carry weapon or one to put up as an heirloom. This is the highest end of Sig Sauer 1911's and they are getting harder and harder to find. Comes with 2 sig sauer factory mags.

Sig Sauer 2022 9mm
Price:$450
This gun is brand new in the box and has never been fired. I purchased this gun and put it in my safe. This gun is chambered in 9mm and is meant to outlast most of your other standard 9mm pistols. This will come with an extra grip that fits larger hands and one high capacity magazine. This is a compact carry gun that is in new condition. Reliability will never be an issue with this pistol. I own another of this model and have shot it regularly. It is a great pistol for the money. 

I will follow the law when selling any of my pistols or rifles. Please do not try to buy a gun from me if you are a felon or cannot possess a firearm. 


Autograph Collection
Price: $5500 or best offer

This collection is valued at over $20,000. I have much much more than my asking price invested in this collection. I am simply trying to move this collection quickly in order to put a down payment on a piece of property. I may consider trades on a few items but I really prefer cash on these autographs. I would like to sell the entire collection all at once because time is limited on my end. This would be perfect for someone to resale on ebay or for an avid collector. I simply don't have the time to sell these items individually so the first person with a reasonable cash offer will take the entire collection. I am only asking $5500 for the entire collection. You won't find a collection like this everyday, especially at this price. Below is a list of every item in my collection. I have also listed prices for what each item typically sells for. Keep in mind, I am only asking a fraction of these prices. $5500 is an absolute steal for a collection like this. I may consider shipping this collection at the buyer's expense. All of my autographs have been authenticated and all come with certificates of authenticity. Thanks for looking.

_______
After receiving a number of emails asking about value. I had the gun appraised at Fox Valley Firearms this past week so I could get their view of the condition and value.

The description back is as follow "" This Winchester Model 88 has bluing that is in good condition. There are a few areas where surface rust has formed near the received on the barrel. The stock has the normal hunting wear from being in the field. There are no cracks or major chips in the stock. The bore of the gun is in excellent condition. All original sights are on the gun and in original condition.""
The price that was given back to me is $2300.

Additional information is that the butt plate had been changed to later Model 88 style which is the lattice style instead of the solid plate. Also, it has a peep sight added which was drilled and tapped for mounting. There was also a small piece of the stock which was removed for clearance of the sight adjuster.

I have several boxes of reloads which I will include with the gun if sold locally. I have placed the gun for sale with Fox Valley Firearms.

Please let me know if you have any questions. If you are wishing to view the gun, it can be seen in Appleton at Fox Valley Firearms."

Shows some wear but functions perfectly. Barrel hood has also been polished. Includes all factory mags. 2 flush 8 round mags and 1 10 shot mag. Also Includes original concealed hammer and sights. Includes custom fitted case. Must ship to an FFL. Will include a Fobus paddle holster if it sells this week (Week ending November 18th) Email for more pictures or questions.

USP Compact

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.
