For those who don't know, the 223 Wylde chamber was designed as a best of both worlds chamber for competition in order to shoot .223 Remington and 5.56 NATO rounds in one chamber.

Barrett Model 99 package which includes Pelican Hard Case, Barrett Rings and Bushnell Tactical Scope.








From Barrett:
Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 optics rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match-toleranced barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a rock-solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. The chamber area is encased by the thick-walled aluminum extrusion of the receiver, resulting in unparalleled safety for the shooter.

The bolt is machined from a single piece of shock-resistant tool steel. The action’s strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt’s few moving parts, an extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly, make it reliable and easy to maintain.

The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is exclusive to Barrett and virtually maintenance-free. The bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting.

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 combines smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot.

Comes with one 13rd magazine and all assesories from original purchase. Magazine release has been switched to conform to a left handed shooter, but is easily reversed to ""normal"" position.

Handling wear comes from an un-professional installation of night sights. Only cosmetic issues are present and only in area of the sights itself from punches and on top of the slide from the vice that held it in place. Comes with original factory sights if you choose not to use the night sights. No damage to anything that impinges the operation or reliability of firearm.

Has number of spare parts (driveshaft, headgaskets, orings, couplers, boots, etc) Boats is race ready, just needs a new driver. Comes RTR with Losi Spektrum 2.4Ghtz radio system and Lith batterys.

Here are the advantages: 
	No requirement to submit fingerprint cards or passport photos to the ATFE.
	No requirement to obtain a signature from a chief law enforcement office in your home jurisdiction.  Many chief law enforcement officers in many jurisdictions are simply refusing to sign your ATFE forms.
	Trusts do not have the costly and cumbersome fees, tax returns, yearly meetings and paperwork legally required by corporation or limited liability companies.  All of these requirements also intrude on your privacy.
	You can exercise control of an NFA item for generations without paying additional $200 Transfer taxes.

These are target rifles built by the Finnish Government from the highly accurate M28 MN rifles. The bore on this rifle slugs at .298"" lands and .308"" grooves, so it designed to shoot .308 projectiles. The bore is sharp and shiny. If it's been shot, it hasn't been shot much.

The numbers are matching on the receiver and bolt. The floorplate is not serialized.

The bluing on this rifle is excellent. There is some wear near the muzzle and on the front sight area, every where else is deep and dark. There are a couple of marks where the bluing has worn near where the barrel mates to the receiver but this location is common to these rifles. I assume that it was how they were stored. There is some cosmoline in a couple of pics.

The rear sight assembly appears to be new except for the aperture.

The stock is in superb condition with only a few handling marks. It is very ergonomic and balances well in the offhand. The grooves handle a Harris adapter very well and so it's no problem to attach a bipod.

The receiver is unmarked and based on what I have found, this seems to be a more recent build.

This rifle does not have the scope mount found on some but I did purchase the JMeck mount. Info can be found here> JMeck No Drill Mount
This mount fits around the receiver and sits flush with the recoil lug. By all accounts it is very secure and is also available. I also have 100 pieces of brand new Lapua 7.62x54r brass for sale. Neither brass, nor mount is for sale until after the rifle has sold or been traded.

Price for the rifle alone is $650 shipped CONUS. It is C&R eligible.

Rifle, brass and scopemount. $800 shipped CONUS.

I would like to trade for:

1) a complete NM A4 upper with detachable NM RRA carry handle.

2) Other complete NM A2 upper, depending on make and barrel.

3) SPRish upper. Most interested in 18"" - 20"" quality barrels and some type of BUIS. Hand guard type is secondary.

Century Arms has a reputation of making firearms that are sometimes hit or miss. This guy is a definite hit. I bought it used, and it has been a rock solid shooter for me. I am open to offers, but will not move far from this price. I will not be sad if it doesn't sell, I am saving up for a SA58, and the accounting department (aka wife) will not give me a PO unless I bring more to the table.  I actually would love to have them both.  OK here's what you would be taking home... A very nice CA C91 Sporter, it will include 6 steel and 3 aluminum mags, a sling, the original furniture (black plastic) and manuals for optics. I have mounted a UTG Tri-Rail with k grip, a duel rail optics mount, 2x17x32MM illuminated (red or green) scope, and a green laser.  The scope will function, non-illuminated, with out batteries, and the laser also comes with the capability to mount with a remote switch. I have replaced the locking piece, firing pin, and ejector lever with new HK parts. Everything you see in the first picture is what will come with the rifle. Finish is average for a milsurp rifle, maybe even a little better. This model is VERY similar to the CETME, I have had both and prefer the C91 just because I like the sights better. I am willing to travel a reasonable distance to meet someone. This will be a face to face sell, I am not interested in shipping the weapon. Not looking for trades, cash only, unless you have a slightly used SA58 18"" Para model. If you have any questions, please email me, I can also provide more pic's if needed.

737,http://www.armslist.com/posts/339737,For Sale/Trade:  Antique Knights of Father Mathew Sword,"Tulsa, BA, Tulsa, Oklahoma",$ 125,"Listed On: Saturday, March 17, 2012",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a ceremonial sword presented to high-ranking members of the Knights of Father Mathew, which was a Catholic Temperance Society. They believed in complete abstinence from alcohol, and movements such as this eventually brought about prohibition to the United States.

Each of these swords have a member's name on one side of the blade, and ""Knights of Father Mathew"" on the reverse side of the blade. This sword belonged to a T.J. Molloy from the St. Louis, Mo. Council Chapter. By Googling the name on the blade, I was actually able to find reference to the original owner on a genealogy site here:

http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/s/u/t/Deborah-J-Sutter/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0046.html

According to the information presented there, the original owner of this sword passed away in 1911, which means the item is well over 100 years old. 

The sword shows some wear for its age. The guard and knight's head shaped pommel have become somewhat oxidized, and the blade has minor aging marks, but no battle scars or signs of rough handling are present. The original hilt-wrap is actually in very good shape. The overall balance of the weapon is impressive for a ceremonial piece. They really don't make presentation swords of this quality anymore, and it this one's form and function has stood the test of time.

A relative of the Molloy family may want to reclaim this sword, or perhaps a collector of Catholic antique memorabilia. As a sword enthusiast myself, I am hesitant to even offer this item for sale, however I need the money.

Not to be disrespectful, but I could also see a tavern or bar owner purchasing this item for display, as a tribute to the fallen opposition of such establishments. Or it could hang in your man cave above your liquor cabinet.

What I do - 

Thoroughly inspect the firearm and clean if necessary (if you want me to clean the firearm, $10 is the cost)

Then I take what I consider to be the ""best"" on the market Ghost inc. 3.5lb trigger (or if you have a preference I can do anything from polishing the factory 5.5lb connector, the ""-"" 4.5lb connector) And then by hand create an almost mirror like polish to all the metal contact points in the trigger system and make it smooth as glass! This isn't a fly by night job, I've done this for my own Glock(s) which you can take a look at and see if you like how they're done. I have also done this for numerous friends/family and even my own boss at work! 


What's included for $50 - Ghost 3.5lb trigger connector, and hand polishing the internals to a mirror finish (multistep process, using 800-1000-1500-2000-3000 grit sandpaper) then buffing to a brilliant shine. 

add $10 if you want me to clean your gun while I'm at it! (I'm very meticulous, once again take a look at any of my personal guns).

While your gun is with me, it resides in a safe that is bolted to the concrete floor in my basement, it is safe and secure and 99% of the time I can have the gun back to you either that day or the next day.

UPDATE:
Hello Folks,
Just want to say thanks for the great response and I am truly thankful to have gotten to speak with such nice people.  I just got back from looking at another 380 acre tract of land that is divided into 5 acre lots that are already cleared and could be made into mini-farms with little effort.  Some of these lots have a view that you can see over 20 miles.
Again, thanks. You guys are the best.
Sincerely,
Mark"
