The Benelli Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility, and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. If you're looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The Benelli Inertia Driven bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.

The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that's more than a pound less! The system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition.

FNH Five-Seven USG OD Green, 20rd Adjustable Sights

Chambered in 5.7x28mm, the FN Five-seveN USG utilizes a polymer frame and slide cover to create an incredibly light and easily maintained autoloading pistol. Single-action operation combined with an internal hammer and highly textured grip enhance handling characteristics. The low recoil impulse of the 5.7x28mm cartridge is only 60% of typical 9mm loadings for rapid and accurate follow-up shots. The Five-seveN USG features a traditional style trigger guard, reversible magazine release, magazine disconnect and adjustable sights. Fixed 3-dot combat sights, either with or without self-luminous tritium elements are also available as an option. Built for extended service under the most demanding conditions, the Five-seveN's hammer-forged barrel has a hard chrome bore finish with a projected 20,000 round life. The Five-seveN USG comes standard with three 20-round magazines and a locking polymer hard case.

It's the one here: http://www.weatherby.com/product/rifles/vanguard/synthetic_package
Except mine is missing the adjustable nylon sling, and one of the hinges on the case is missing but it still works. The rifle is brand new, never been fired, plastic cover is still on the bolt handle. Like all Weatherby rifles, it's guaranteed to shoot a 1 1/2"" or better 3-shot group at 100 yards from a cold barrel.

Weatherby wants $729, I'll take off $229 for the missing sling and case hinge. You can go buy a nice sling and a better stock with the money you saved!

I took this gun in on trade and absolutely love it.  This is the magic barrel length for precision AR’s.  The trigger is wonderful and the gun is boringly accurate.  It will easily hold ½ MOA on a 100 meter zero, and it will stay accurate well past transonic/ subsonic flight.  

I’m moving on from it because the side charging handle is not necessary for me as I don’t really use an adjustable cheek piece.  If you do than the side charging handle is absolutely imperative.

The round count on this gun is right at 240 rounds.

I bought it after a deployment on impulse and have never fired it myself, but the friend of mine I bought it from is ex-SWAT and he put a couple hundred rounds through it, but not much.  It's an abolutely immaculate rifle, and really needs to find a home with somebody who is going to shoot it. I feel like I have a Ferrari that I just let sit in the garage when I see this thing in it's case (which I will include in the sale) in my office. Also included in the sale are two magazines, one 30rd and one 15rd. Now I have to sell it to make way for my new daughter on the way, but it will really make somebody out there happy.

Please, for the love of God, somebody out there take this gun to the range and enjoy it like I never did!"

I have original crossed cannon grips as well as better quality VX G-10 grips with blackened screws.

This is the nicest pistol I've ever owned. Trigger breaks like glass and it is a tackdriver. Hate to put it up for sale, but it is too big for me to CCW comfortably and it isn't getting shot at the range. Since I bought this nearly 2 years ago I fired it at the range once, cleaned it, and put it in the safe. Every now and then I took it out to fondle but that's about it. Was carrying a Star BM instead but decided that was too heavy for me as well. I've decided to move away from this caliber altogether.

I have a lightly used Springfield Armory Stainless Loaded 9mm with adjustable sights & ambi safety in the original blue plastic case with papers and all the stuff that came with it, including a Kydex holster and dual mag carrier. Info on this piece is at their website here: http://www.springfield-armory.com/armory.php?version=22

Pistol's prior owner had a great gunsmith lighten the trigger to about 3#. It is the best trigger job I've ever seen. He stated he only put a few hundred rounds through it before deciding he wanted a .45 instead. I put less than 50 rds through it myself. There are a few minor scuffs on the stainless finish that were there when I bought it -- looks like from the original owner drawing it from the Kydex. I have the original grips but replaced them with VZ Double Diamond in black G-10 which looks nicer and feels great. http://vzgrips.com/gun-grips/1911-pistol-grips-1/double-diamonds-1/double-diamond-black-g10 Aside from that, the only change I made to this piece was to touch up the sights with a bit of nail polish (white on the back, red on the front) which I think is an improvement, but if you don't like it or want to redo it, it is very easily removed with a bit of acetone on a swab.

In addition to the aforementioned Kydex holster (RH), I have several other holsters that I could include, first two I'll throw in for free, willing to work out a deal on the other two. One is a cheapo ambi belt slide that I got for free and never used, the others are really nice. First one is a Galco IWB tuckable w/J-hook (LH). Next is an impossible to find Israeli Front Line IWB with teflon lining (LH). Last is a Galco Miami Classic shoulder rig in like new condition. This is set up for LH, but you can make it RH simply by switching it around, but if you want to get a proper RH holster for a clean draw Optics Planet has one you can add on for about $40 (this is a modular system).

I have a total of 7 top quality magazines for this pistol. This takes 9rd mags but one is a Wilson 10rd.

I have well over a grand in this package.

I'm asking $850 cash for everything.


Would do an even exchange for an EMP.

For partial trades, I like .25 automatics. Might consider .380 but I'm picky. I like the SIG P230 and the chrome slide LCP.  No more long guns -- I haven't got any room for them.

I am in no hurry to sell. I will likely regret selling this. But it is impractical for me because my eyes aren't good enough to target shoot and it is too big for me to carry. Someone wants this. Open to reasonable offers but please do not insult me with ridiculous lowballs.

I will try to get pics up tomorrow night. Trust me, it is really nice. Like new except for light holster wear.

WILL NOT SHIP

NO BAD GUYS

Springfield EMP Enhanced Micro Pistol PI9240LP, 40 S&W, 3 in, Cocobolo Wood Grip, BiTone Finish, 8 Rd 



Springfield Armory has created the smallest, most concealable 1911 available: The Enhanced Micro Pistol - EMP. Importantly, you can't reduce the outer dimensions of a pistol without going after the inner workings, too. All together we had to re-engineer 15 different parts. What we got in the end was not just a new gun, but a new class of gun - the short-action 1911. Now that the hard part is out of the way, other gunmakers will surely copy it. But when you see their copies that look almost like a Springfield EMP, you'll say to yourself, Hey, that looks almost like a Springfield EMP. It's great to be first .

Original Old West Single-Action Look, Size and Feel. Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger® Vaquero® has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority. It is often referred to as ""the gun that won the New West"" because of its widespread popularity among single-action shooters and cowboy action competitors.

The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk®, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800's.

Additionally, the weapon comes with Pearce magazine extensions already installed on the two factory magazines.  The original plates for the bottoms of the magazines will also be included.  It also has installed a plug for the open space in the backstrap which can be removed by hand if you wish.  It also has grip tape installed around the grip which can also be removed if you wish.  Personally, this tape helps a lot in maintaining control when firing the weapon and increases accuracy (for me at least) on follow up shots.
