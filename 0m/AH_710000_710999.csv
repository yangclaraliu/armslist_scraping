Upper has Cardinal Forge marks on it, not sure of brand. Dust cover removed as I am not toting it around the sandbox. Bought the upper minus BCG from a friend/match shooter. He claimed it was an RRA and the barrel had 1:8 twist. 

Bull barrel is heavy, 20"" stainless and fully floated. Shoots minute of prairie dog with federal 55 gr ball and even better with 69 gr match.

Selling to buy an M1 or M1A. Will trade up/down for M1 Garand, M1A, decked out Remington 700, really nice AK, AR10, FAL, or a non-garbage CETME/G3.

Will throw in a Teflon bushmaster mag, and the (garbage) Barska 6.5-20x50 scope (good luck holding zero). A rifle like this really deserves a Leupold or better (and mine isn't for sale).

Seekins Precision Lower
The SP 223 Billet lower feature a unique design geared towards the serious tactical shooter. The oversized winter trigger guard, quick access mag release, beveled mag well, ambi bolt drop and user friendly features make this lower the best on the market. Ambidextrous bolt control allows the shooter to quickly drop the bolt or from either side of the firearm. 

Details:
•	Perfectly CNC Machined from 7075 T6 Billet
•	Gen 2 configuration
•	Ambidextrous bolt release
•	Mil-Spec component compatible
•	SP Enhanced bolt catch
•	Bullet pictogram selector markings
•	Type III Class 2 Hardcoat Anodized Finish

AR-Restor Recoil Buffer:
Tames felt recoil & suppresses bolt bounce for maximum reliability, accuracy & service life.

AR-15 CS Buffer Spring:
Made of chrome silicon alloy; which offers significant, advanced operational enhancements for the shooter who is serious about firearm performance.

VLTOR Mil-Spec Receiver Extension:
Receiver extension tube has the correct, 1.146"" outside diameter for mounting collapsible buttstocks designed for the smaller, mil-spec tube. Allows fast, easy repeatability of buttstock position with five notches on underside to accept the stock’s locking pin and corresponding white position numbers on top visible through the witness hole on many stocks. Precision machined from aluminum bar stock for consistent dimensions that ensure smooth, snag-free sliding of buttstock.

TAPCO Sling Adapter:
•	Mil-spec black phosphate finish
•	Made in USA
•	One piece stamped steel construction reduces potential for breakage
•	No bind ambidextrous sling attachment allows for 180 degrees of movement
•	No need to reattach sling to opposite side of the rifle when transitioning to offhand shooting

Aero Precision Upper Receiver:
•	Forged from 7075 T6 aluminum

•	M4 feedramps 
•	Matte black hard coat anodized Mil 8625 Type 3 Class 2 finish 
•	.250” takedown pin holes 
•	Laser engraved U.S. Flag on the top of the receiver 

Carbon Fiber Free Floating Rail System
Tubular free-float forearm is made of lightweight, high-strength carbon fiber to reduce heat transfer to the shooter’s hand during sustained fire and provide excellent handling characteristics. Precision-made, aluminum barrel nut rigidly clamps the forearm to the upper receiver. Generous porting on some models enhances heat transfer while reducing weight even more. 

AR-Stoner M4-Contour AR-15 Barrel
•	Length: 16”
•	Material: 4140 Chrome Moly Steel
•	Contour: M4
•	Chamber: 5.56x45mm NATO
•	Twist Rate: 1 in 9”
•	Finish: Manganese Phosphate (Parkerized)
•	M4 Feed Ramps: Yes

KNS Precision Non-Rotating Pin Set:
Redesigned hammer pin and anti-rotation links provide the strongest possible system to eliminate pin rotation. Helps prevent wear to receiver holes, which is especially important for increasingly-valuable M16 and pre-ban receivers. Notched hammer pin locks into slots in the anti-rotation links; trigger is secured with locking screws, and includes lube ports so adequate lubrication reaches the trigger. Anti-rotation links fit on the outside of the receiver to prevent all movement.

Battle Comp 2.0:
Multi-purpose compensator reduces muzzle climb, so you stay on target between shots during rapid fire engagements. Reduces flash signature and produces less concussion than the standard A2 flash hider for a smaller dust signature when shooting prone.

Laser Etched Gun Parts:
Ejection Port Cover
Extended Charging Handle Latch
Oversize Magazine Button
Magazine Catch Latch
Forward Assist Button Cover

Edit: 12/20 - Price Drop $525 to $500, new pics up. Still includes the APEX CAEK trigger!!

Upgrade 12/16/12***  I will be including an APEX CAEK (Competition Action Enhancement Kit) trigger and all the original trigger housing parts if you decide to go back. The APEX brings the trigger pull lighter than a Glock or XDM about 4lbs.  

TRIGGER COST over $100 installed through G and R tactical. 

The reset is incredibly short, and the trigger is very smooth. There is a long pull and pretravel, but a Light break and short reset allowing for fast follow up shots.

For Sale is an Excellent Condition Smith and Wesson M&P chambered in 9mm.

Included is the Original Box, All Paperwork, Custom Grip Tape (very nice), Adjustable Palm Swells, 2 Magazines.

Range tested this firearm. Trigger is better than I thought. On par with some IDPA competition trigger's I've used on a Glock 17/34. 

When I traded a buddy for this firearm it came with a threaded barrel which showed some minor wear from normal use.

THE STANDARD BARREL appears to have NOT been used or used very very little.. I've reinstalled the STANDARD BARREL. 

Very ergonomic pistol, can't get a better trigger in the M&P Platform than the APEX and the CAEK gives you a competition trigger if you do IDPA or that kind of thing.


This firearm is available FTF in Longview/Tyler or DFW when I'm free to make a trip up there."

This was the only pistol that Mossberg ever produced making it highly sought after for collectors. This particular pistol was manufactured in 1923 and is in great functioning condition. I have shot this and it functions perfectly and is fairly accurate for its size. Each pull of the trigger fires the barrels in succession as the firing pin rotates. The pistol is in fair shape with bluing loss over the majority of the firearm and some peppering on the metal. The majority of these firearms were used hard by farmers and ranchers as they fit very neatly in a pocket and they are very hard to find in functioning condition let alone with a Majority of the bluing remaining. All in all this is a great functioning example of a scarce little pistol. Firearm must be transferred buyer pays transfer fee. Will consider trades on an Ak-47 E-mail, call, or text REDACTED"

With the introduction of the P938, Sig Sauer now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately. The most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations."

BERETTA M9A1 (92FS) + Three PVD 15 round Magazines!

This is a Beretta M9 that is less than two years old and has less than 200 rounds thru it.
 It is in fantastic shape, and has many plus features as described below. Pistol made in USA in Accokeek, MD.

It comes with or installed:

A threaded 1/2"" x 28 t.p.i. barrel and 3 barrel thread protectors. The barrel was done by Tornado Technologies Inc. so that muzzle break, suppressor can be added. (MSRP $195.00)

Trijicon Inc. tritium night sights- done by Trijicon themselves in-house (had slide shipped to them for professional installation of tritium night sights). Cost was $183.00.

There is NO plastic / nylon on this pistol. The trigger, steel guide rod, safety de-cocking lever (safety), and lanyard spring housing replaced with all steel parts. Cost and installation by Gunsmith of these parts was around $240.00)

A Wolff GunSprings Inc. trigger conversion unit (I.N.S. model- Immigration and Naturalization Services) extra power unit for faster, crisper returns. (MSRP $19.99)

Wolff Gunsprings Inc. steel guide rod. (MSRP $24.95)

Wolff Gunsprings Inc. recoil spring x-tra power, 16# (MSRP $7.89)

A Beretta USA oversize magazine release button. OEM part. (MSRP $39.00)

Hogue overmolded black grips with finger groves and Hogue hex (Allen) grip screws. (MSRP $16.95 for grips + $8.95)

(3) Beretta USA M9A sand resistant PVD 15 rnd. magazines with Beretta black rubber magazine pads. Magazines and magazine pads Beretta OEM parts (MSRP $55.00 for each magazine + $7.00 per black rubber magazine pads!) Magazines are made in Italy. The keys are a special PVD coating, a lowfrictionfollower, and internal box geometry for the greatest reliability and durability from the magazine.

Wolff Gunspring Inc. +10% extra power magazine springs inside all three magazines. (MSRP $17.29)

A Wolff Gunsprings Inc. ""D"" spring installed (main spring made for Beretta model 96) for smoother lighter double action pull (first pull of trigger- smoother than factory spring). (MSRP $14.99)

If you were going to own a Beretta, this M9 A1 is ready to roll with all its accessories and add-ons! Picatinny rail also a stand out and functional for adaptation of laser and/or weapon light. This rail is incorporated in design / manufacture of pistol. This M9 is almost factory new and would say a 98% condition. Email me with any questions. Comes with Instruction manual, but no box (box was plain cardboard with NSN# for military shipment).

If you have any knowledge of the Beretta 92's, this pistol is loaded (no pun) with great trigger control and a gentle first pull with the ""D"" spring installed. Trijicon tritium sights are year 2011 and still have plenty of time before half-life expiration of tritium. Trijicon drills front sight and installation was professionally done in-house at Trijicon. An extremely accurate, functional almost new out of box M9A1 pistol! The tritium 3-dot sights are all green.

I have been recieving questions as to ""what"" this is- an M9A1 or a 92FS. It is most certainly a M9A1. Also I placed a small piece of duct tape over serial #'s for privacy- and the #'s are not de-faced in any way. The following answer to a question I recieved may be able to clear things up a bit:

It is a M9A1. I placed a piece of ""hurricane"" black duct tape over last digits to protect privacy. It is by no means defaced and duct tape comes ""right off"".
 The Instruction book that was included was for that of a 92FS.

On left side of frame ON FRAME by serial # is stamped- Type M9A1 above picatinny rail.

On right side of slide ON SLIDE ITSELF (not on frame) is stamped- MOD. 92FS-CAL 9MM Parabellum- PATENTED.


Hopefully this is helpful and I accept all emails with your questions about this pistol."

Patented integral scope mounts machined directly on the solid-steel receiver provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings. The Mini-14 All Weather Ranch Rifle's black synthetic stock is checkered for a sure grip in any weather condition. Garand-type safety."

**Receiver flat thickness= 1mm (.040"")

**Rails and flat need to be heat treated. Then Welded to Receiver.
To use these flats you will need to have a 5mm and 7mm reamer.  The physics of bending sheet metal make it next to impossible to have a bend close to a hole without distorting slightly.  To solve this the holes on the flat are undersized and need to be reamed to size. 
The rails that come with the flats are pictured below. They have mag stabilizers on both rails to keep the mag from tilting and causing feed problems.  After installing the rails you will need to trim the mag stabilizers to match the thickness of the Mag you are using. (7.62 or 5.56)"

I've shot it quite a bit, but it has not seen excessive use or been abused in any sense.  It is clean and ready to go.  Someone really worried about detail could give the stainless a polish to really bring out the shine.  I don't HAVE to get rid of it, but I bought a conversion for my Glock and don't really need this one any more.

I have had this a few yeras and shot it very little.  I've usually gravitated toward the Colt Series 70 the majority of the time.  I'm transitioning away from the 1911 platform now and letting this go to finance some new aquisitions.  This is being sold in practically new condition in the original packaging.  If this gun was a car it would be a race car or exotic super car.  The new owner is gonna love it.

""Taurus Judge®"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights, bobbed hammer with beautiful blue finish, and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law

I am selling because I thought I would like Trap and Skeet shooting and Competitions, so I had this beautiful gun. But I really just love waterfowl and upland game hunting. This gun was great for upland so accurate and smooth, but here as many places waterfowl hunting is nasty and this gun is too nice IMHO to have out there. i took it twice and spent more time wiping it down then hunting. lol. So I will just use my waterfowl shotgun and get another one and if I have the hankering shoot skeet with those.

Oh yeah... I have a ""Hell Fire"" trigger system I'll throw in. It's the original ""Bump-Fire"" spring-behind-the-trigger and it is ATF approved- still in the box with the manual.

This rifle is a pure BEAST!! Everything is nice and solid. Super-smooth operation. Excellent Condition- no bumps or bruises or gouges. Could be used for civil defense or for hunting. And swear on the Bible- this rifle has NEVER jammed or misfired or choked in any way. Forward Assist has never been used- EVER! I will bet my life on this rifle- that's how solid it is.. and the 20 inch H-Bar is one of the most accurate rifles you can get. What does Colt or Armalite or Daniel mean if you can't hit with it cold???  Bolt carrier is EXACTLY like a Colt and the S&W M&P- end length (underside), screw ""staking""- Everything (I side-by-side compared them- Bushy was actually heavier (better in my opinion) than the S&W- I weighed them) ______

This is a REAL BushMaster, not a copy or a fake. Yes, the Chinese make knock-off BushMasters (the say Somewhere, NY and not Windham, ME) which is what gave them their bad name (cheap bolts, bad staking, horrible barrels). If you ever come across one, you'll know it... feels like a toy- complete garbage. I have owned dozens of ARs- from Colts to Daniel's to complete ""put-togethers"" and honestly, my BushMasters have always out-performed the others. Some are better in specific areas, but as an over-all package.. I'll take a BushMaster every time with money left over for ammo!! :)______

Yes, I know all the BIG BOX stores (Sportco, Cabela's, etc.) sell these for about $10, but:
1.  They charge sales tax
2.  They don't deliver for free (unless you want 50 of them)
3.  They won't cut you a deal on a higher quantity
4.  They don't care about how much gas/time you used getting there
5.  They don't have them listed on their website for shipping deals

I'm willing to work with you on ALL of these points, so is it REALLY worth 2-3 hours of your time to save about $1 a mag.

Also features some very nice original wooden furniture and a Houge pistol grip (much more comfortable than the original) plus two 30rd mags.

I probably gave her more than it is worth but my intent was to help her out and I thought it was a neat looking gun. Her story is that this pistol was a family heirloom actually carried by some family member during the CIVIL WAR.

The gun has a 33 stamped on the front end of the cylinder as well as on the cartridge extractor. It has a matching emblem on the barrel, frame, and cylinder that looks like a U or ""horse shoe"" with two crowns on top of it. The gun functions well, locks up tight and is in fair condition.  I measured the barrel and it appears to be 9mm or slightly larger...

THANKS to everyone who sent responses and helped me figure this out!  You guys are great, I have received all kinds of opinions but nothing is certain...Of all the feedback I got, it appears to be French, German, or Belgium made, probably after the civil war but in the late 1800's.  Many opinions abound on its worth but none offered to pay me their suggested value so...there you go.   I personally would rather have a gun I can shoot so I will consider cash or trade offers.  I have lowered the price to a very reasonable deal for anyone who collects antique guns.   Thanks again to all of you for your time and suggestions."

What we have here is a fairly difficult to find Finnish M24.

This is one of the first rifles ever produced by or for the Finnish Civil Guard(1924-1928), it has the German made Bohler Stahl stepped barrel.

Much more information about them can be garnered from the site below, a truly remarkable history in these rifles as they most assuredly were used at least in two wars.

http://mosinnagant.net/finland/M24-Rifle.asp

I am listing this rifle for $400.00 FTF sale in the Richmond, Henrico, Mechanicsville area.

It has a matching bolt and is in a nice condition with original bluing.

However as with most rifles in my collection, I have not fired it. 

Sorry this one does have a small CAI (Century) import mark on the barrel under the front sight (as required on later imports) and is counter-bored for improved accuracy, the sling itself is not part of the sale, but the sling swivels do stay with the rifle.

I am listing it for $400.00 FTF sale in the Richmond, Henrico, Mechanicsville area.

This rifle and a few others available because I am funding another purchase.

Take a look at the pic.s and decide for yourself.

 * The bolt of the VZ 2008stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
 * The VZ 2008 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
 * The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ 2008.
 * The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ 2008.
 * The VZ 2008 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. 
* The alloy magazine of the VZ 58 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lb. vs. .84 lb.)
 * VZ 2008 is easier to field strip.

Comes with box, 1 ruger 15rd mag and a brand new Mec-Gar 17 rd mag still in the package.  This gun has had about 300 rds shot flawlessly through it.  I had a trigger job done on it by a local gun smith and it is nice, real light double action trigger.  This was my house gun but I am in the market for a Ruger 10/22 Takedown model and this is how I am funding it.  Will sell for $350 firm or trade for your 10/22 Takedown model.  If you try to lowball me dont be surprise if I dont respond to you because I have more than $350 into this gun with the trigger job."
