You simply open the door, load 75 rounds of ammo, close the door and wind up the spring.

These are great for storing loaded ammo supplies. Load it, don't wind it until you need it. The spring does NOT weaken even during long term storage!

This drum attaches to the rifle exactly like a normal clip. No alterations to the rifle are required. Simply drop in all 75 rounds of ammo, close the cover, wind up the spring, and you are ready to fire.  A wind-up drum is a great way to store a loaded magazine long-term without the worry of a compressed spring loosing its ability to deliver enough push to empty a magazine.  With the drum, you don't wind up the spring until you are ready to use the drum.

That actually says it all.  If it's full MIL-SPEC then the dimensions, material and finish are all the same.  The CNC x,y,z's cut to the numbers. The alloy is MIL-SPEC forged aircraft grade 7075 T6,the machining is MIL-SPEC, the finish is MIL-SPEC (anodized Hard Coat mil-A-8625.).  The quality of the build, and it's accuracy, is more about barrel and breach, bolt and trigger group than about the label on a firearm that will become legally non-transferable once our government redefines ""...shall not be infringed"".  H&K, Wilson, etc, the name on the side will be of little value once SB XXXX AWB is passed, and some variation will get passed, sooner or later.  If it can't be legally transferred, the branding name's value is irrelevant. Then, only performance will count.
     This AR stripped lower was manufactured by Aero Precision for SAA.  They, AP, produce all sorts of MIL-SPEC goodies, including the  Dillon Aero M134 mini gun and they are the OEM for ""SPIKES"" (which has been selling on GB at more than $150 above this asking price), also the OEM for GTG uppers and lowers and the OEM for Armalite (which is selling on GB at much higher prices).  They do the Armalite AR-10 lowers and the Noveske N6 lowers (high-end quality stuff), and a whole host of other brands to boot.  It's the same machine tools, same specs.  When it's zombie time, labels no longer matter.
      Brand new, untouched, and there will be no paperwork for you as an Oregon resident.  Show me enough of your Oregon Driver's License that the picture verifies it's you and the part that shows you have a Oregon residence and there is no money spent on shipping, insurance, Transfer Fee Tax or FFL confiscation form filing.  
     This is CASH, FTF.  Before the transaction you must state ""that there is no known reason that this transaction will/would violate any Local, State, or Federal Law or regulation"", and it's yours.

Priced at $225 OBO.  

     As a sidebar:  The way to go with one of these is to also build it as a 7.62x35 ACC .300 BlackOut.  EVERYTHING identical to the .223/5.56 AR except a different barrel and you're throwin' a real 30 cal down range.  Magazines, brass cases, rails, covers, all the same.  Just a different barrel.  Reload .223/5.56 cases after necking and trimming with 7.62X35 bullets and out perform AK's and AR's.  Took ACC and Remington and more than fifty year to finally get these guys right, a light battle rifle with penetration and knock down."

Wanting to trade for a Ruger, single action in 44 mag. Looking for 5 1/2"" or shorter 
barrel, but not shorter than 3 1/2"" May consider a 357 mag Ruger Vaquero 
I am not interested in 45 Long colt Rugers.
This AP-9 extremely clean and functions with out any problems....and is a lot of fun
Also comes with custom fabricated OD green sling
This gun is similar to the Tec-9, even uses the same mags, but the rifleling is a little
deeper than the Tec-9 and considered more accurate. This has a 5"" barrel 

The AP-9 is a pistol that was manufactured by AA Arms and distributed by Kimel Industries, Inc of Indian Trail, North Carolina, US AAArms began distributing the AP-9 in the early 1990s and did so until 2001

I will list this as  Intratec Tec-9 so will pop up in a search....for there is not a separate category for this AA Arms AP-9

** if you reply and sound like spam, I probably will not respond....one needs to respond more than ""I would like to buy if it is still for sale"" or ""it is in good shape ?"" at least respond with the what I am offering, and maybe a name and phone number
Just to much BS anymore......will only meet in person  to trade or sell during daylight hours

If it is listed, it is still available......for I will pull off armslist if I trade or sell...asap

Bottom of lever has some wear. This rifle is 100 % all original without being reblued or refinished. Hooded front open sight, buckhorn rear sight and checkered forearm/ pistol grip with a steel end cap. The carbine has nice rifling and a great bore. No chips, cracks, major dents or gouges, very little cosmetic imperfections on this piece. The wood is also excellent with a few minor handling marks and overall crisp checkering. The carbine is mechanically excellent and seen very little use. The total production for the Winchester model 71’s is just over 47,000 with rumor that only 3000 were in the carbine variety. This is one of the nicest model 71 carbines I have seen over the years. The serial number on this rifle is 17493 therefore making this rifle manufactured in 1940.

Polytech AKS762 (stamped receiver) original side folder; they are the gold standard of the imported 7.62x39mm AK’s  NRA 100% it has always been properly cleaned and stored; 4-30rd steel magazines, 200 rounds of Chinese street core copper wash ammo, considered by many to be the best surplus mil spec ammo to ever come into the U.S market.  This rifle is very accurate and flawless in function. If you come to me, you can test fire rifle at a near by range. These rifles are extremely hard to find; most the people that pick them up are AK collectors. These rifles are not like the other Polytech Type 56-1’s “Motorized infantry version” that you see with spike folding bayonets under the barrel, this model was designed and intended for “Airborne troops” having the AKM lock “On & Off” type combat knife and bayonet.
The Polytech when compared; is always compared too the Russian AK47 because of it stronger thinker stamped receiver…. other imported AK’s are thinner and have  1/8 the shooting life of Polytech AKS…. do mainly to being originally designed for sustained full auto fire and thus the reason for the thicker stamped receiver.
This Polytech is “not” an import parts gun or US market Frankenstein.
Rifle also comes with a single point sling.
I have more photos. You must be 21 years of age and be able to legally own firearms, I.D required. Shipping and insurance is paid by the buyer.

V-block, V-block Screws, Bolt Pin, Trigger Group Cross Pins, and Take Down Screw. Here is some factory info. 

The CH22 billet precision machined receiver incorporates a stainless steel charging handle in the rear of the receiver that eliminates the traditional factory charging handle on the side of the rifle. The charging handle for the CH22 receiver operates transparently within the integral picatinney rail. Like an AR15, the rear charging handle makes charging or clearing your rifle fast and easy. The charging handle does not reciprocate with the bolt each time the rifle is fired and it is secured firmly in the closed position using a spring loaded ball detent.
 The use of a rear charging handle on the CH22 provides many functional and operational advantages not available with a traditional side charging factory bolt setup"

Here is a definition form wiki. A Paradox gun is a firearm with the last two to three inches of the muzzle rifled and the rest smooth, intended to be used as both a rifle and shotgun. Paradox guns served the needs of hunters in India and Africa who might encounter both small and large game but needed to carry only a single gun. A Paradox gun allowed the use of standard shotgun shells for small game and Paradox bullets (shot with a spin from the rifling) for large game. Modern users of Paradox guns have the same advantage, especially in areas where the bird and deer hunting seasons overlap. Paradox cartridges have been loaded with either hollow-point or solid bullets of varied composition. The current Holland & Holland cartridge is loaded with the most useful of these, the 740 grain lead solid. Take a look at our other fine guns at"

SOLD   Also have 500 rounds 55gr FMJ in 50 round white boxes SOLD

  At the high prices I see at .80 a round +, if I can sell these at .65 I will start doing more loading.  Email your phone number and I will call you with mine as I do not respond to ANY emails due to spam.  I am located in West Greeley.

I get quite a few emails asking if this rifle is still available. I will remove or edit the listing when it is sold, otherwise it is available.  Thank you!

For sale is a Bushmaster M4 A3 AR15 in 6.8 SPC. The rifle is brand new and never fired outside of the factory.  Comes with case, instruction manual, and 1 high capacity magazine. On Bushmaster's website they call this a ""M4 type Patrolman's Carbine - A3 - Removable handle Rifle with Telestock""

While 6.8 SPC is a great cartridge on its own, it is worth noting that this lower is 100% compatible with .223/556 upper receivers.  To change the caliber of this rifle to .223 you would just take off the 6.8 SPC upper, put on the .223 upper, and switch magazines - done!

Asking $1100 cash, no trades please

An older, but very well kept Pedersoli Kentucky Rifle. This was an unshot domestic wallhanger until I bought it, and I have put less than 20 rounds through it. It's a single trigger, has great spark, and a new vent liner with two shots through it. 13/16"" barrel, with 33"" length. Lightweight but good shooter. I am sorry I dont know if it is 1:48 or 1:66 twist. It has a dovetail v-notch rear and teardrop front sight, both shined brass. They are the only brass that has been shined. The rest has been left how I got it, with a nice patina on it. No rust on the barrel, the stock is well oiled, and has very few handling marks."

This is a great buy for someone who wants to stock up on some 20 guage high brass.  It is all 20 gauge, 3"" #5 shot for turkey or pheasant or zombies.  Makes a nice home defense round as well.  10 rounds are # 6 shot.  These sell for $12.00 a box of 10 at Wal Mart.  There are 150 rounds.  Most are out of the box because I had them in a waterproof ammo box.  Retail value is $180.00.  You can have all for $90.00.  I no longer have a 20 gauge so have no use for them.

Comes just as it is from the factory...  Get them while you can as these are impossible to find in stores.  Any questions let me know, Mike


The Colt M4 .22 looks and feels like an actual M4, creating one of the most exciting .22 caliber firearms available.  Engineered from the ground up as a dedicated .22 rimfire, this AR style Colt features a 16.2-inch barrel, collapsible stock, flat-top receiver with detachable carry handle, CAR handguards, flash hider, A2 pistol grip, and 30-round magazine.

A tactical .22 rifle like this Colt is ideal for new shooters who are learning handling and operation. A gun like this Colt .22 M4, M4 Ops, as well as the Colt M16 .22 can have many uses-plinking, target practice and small-game hunting where allowed....all of which offer an economical shooting option."

The only problem is the PTO clutch that drives the deck keeps sticking in the ""on"" position.  It will sometimes disengage normally (it never NOT works, just sometimes works too much!)  This makes it difficult to start due to trying to turn the engine and the deck over.  I currently have the belt off the PTO and it starts perfect.

The serial number, 64***, places its date of manufacture between 1889 and 1900, and it is a numbers-matching piece.  It was evaluated by Tucson Guns and Western Artifacts in 2009, who found that “the shotgun is in excellent mechanical condition but the barrels are corroded”, and valued at $850 (I do have the paperwork).  The furniture is in very good condition with scratches one would expect from 110+ year old piece; the checkering is original and has not been re-cut.  The buttplate is the original hard rubber with the Remington Arms logo and all fasteners are original.  $450.00."

Very rare and in mint condition. Very few produced. Comes with 2 mags bayonet, scope mount and 3.5x10x32 scope. Asking 2000. Will add pic soon. Here is description from manufactuer:

The AK-54R rifles are built upon Category 1 (nice, minty, un issued) Romanian PSL rifle parts kits, using a special receiver that allows for the use of regular AKM type butt stocks and pistol grips. They also feature a correct, and fully functional, scope mount, installed on the left side of the receiver . The barrel is shortened to 16.5 inches, and is re-profiled, allowing the gas block and handguard retainer to be moved rearward, so that standard AKM length gas pistons (we use a Tapco stainless unit, which provides an extra 922r compliance part) and standard AKM type handguards can be used! The idea is simply to give the end user an AKM sized package that delivers the powerful punch of the 7.62x54R cartridge. This initial batch of rifles will feature a non-pinned Romanian PSL muzzle device, on 14x1 LH threads, K-VAR synthetic furniture, in plum, beautiful gun kote finish ."

Holster Included - Murphy's Custom Leather Holster, company based in China Grove, NC. - The holster is high quality, provides a very snug fit with no need for a strap, is slim and low profile, and is made for right handed use, belt holster. All Leather.

This gun is in new condition. It has been fired less than 500 times and cared for EXTREMELY well. There is NO sign of use, abuse, or wear on the gun.

Below is an excerpt from KAHR.com:

The designer's first priority for the Kahr pistol was quality, and that is the final product.

The union of advanced design, quality materials and proper construction makes Kahr the smallest, thinnest, most reliable full power compact pistol. A value that can't be matched.

Reliability. Unless the gun is 100% reliable, all else is meaningless. Kahr pistols have proven their reliability in testing by Federal, State and local agencies.

Size. Ergonomically, the Kahr compact pistol excels. The gun is easy to shoot well, and comfortable to carry for extended periods due to its thin profile.

Power. Despite their diminutive size, Kahr pistols deliver full size ballistic performance.

So, when it comes to protecting your life, choose the value gun. Choose the gun stamped KAHR.

A value, unmatched at any price.

Six U.S. Patents cover Kahr's unique locking, firing, and extraction systems. The incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a cam to both unlock the passive safety and finish cocking and releasing the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.

Kahr's patented ""offset barrel"" design places the trigger mechanism beside the barrel lug, raising the shooter's hand close to the center line of the bore. This, with the ergonomically designed grips, results in a remarkable degree of shooting comfort and control with reduced muzzle flip and felt recoil.

A patented self-cleaning extractor, specially designed so that powder residue is forced away from the extractor, assures that the extractor will continue to function, shot after shot. Furthermore, the extractor is designed so that it employs the slide itself to limit its movement so that failures to extract are nearly impossible.

These innovations, found only in the Kahr pistol, give the Kahr shooter an advantage in critical self-defensive situations. The Kahr design and its quality manufacturing provide unmatched value in a compact handgun, especially important when your life depends on it.

Utilizing the programming and tooling capabilities of CNC machining centers, Kahr pistols' main components are precision computer machined to the tightest universal tolerances. Machined parts, cut exactly to the engineering blueprint, assure proper assembly and peak performance of the Kahr pistol."
