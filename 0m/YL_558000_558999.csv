I have a mint condition, S&W M&P 9C for sale. This weapon has a 3.5"" barrel, and somewhat light in weight.  I'm asking $400.00 for it, only because I bought it new, and NEVER fired a round through it. There is a Mega Pawn Shop that sells these new without my accessories, and they want $599.00 for it! (so, you tell me who has the better deal). I bought it for home & personal protection, but Wifey doesn't really want it here because her Daughter, Daughter's boyfriend, & our Granddaughter is moving in because of hard times. Granddaughter is 4, so I agreed to sell it, until they move out, then get another one. (and I will be needing money to fix up the basement and upstairs for them.)  I've never sold a firearm before, but, I'll be checking with Law Enforcement soon to figure out the legal steps to sell it.  And, I would like to meet in a Police Parking lot so you can see that it is not stolen, and for our safety as well. I do have a CPL, and I know you must have a Purchasing Permit, or CPL as well.  It comes with two original magazines, (12 rounds each), one with a ""pinkie"" extension, the other is a flat bottom.  It comes with a full box of ammo (Zombie MAX, 25 rounds). It also has 3 different size backstraps, one on the firearm, and you can see the other 2 in the pics.  It has the original hard  case, and the first shell casing that was fired before it was up for sale.  I also have 2 Holsters, one from ""Uncle Mike's"" purchased from the Gun Store (right-handed, inside waistband), and 1 that I ordered from eBay that goes outside the waistband, and mounts with a belt loop.  I am also throwing in a brand new cable lock that is from the Sheriff's Office. This Weapon is in pristine, undamaged condition. ( a perfect 10 out of 10).  And no, I never dry fired it, nor banged it around or anything. I treated it VERY well.  I purchased this weapon roughly 2-3 months ago, something like that, I haven't looked at the receipt since I bought it.  Thanks for looking, any questions, please ask.  My name is Bob."

Only thing I would be interested in trading for would be a Super Redhawk in .44 mag only because they are much easier to scope for hunting and I am not about to drill and tap this stunning gun.  Lastly, have original box and it may have never even been shot.  It looks that new.  I am doubtful because I am not the original owner and I picked it up before knowing that they are not as easily scoped.  Thanks! Also, if interested we will meet at a gunshop so we can transfer paperwork into your name.

217,http://www.armslist.com/posts/558217,For Sale/Trade:  Saiga-M rifle .223 Remington,"Eustis, Orlando, Florida",$ 475,"Listed On: Tuesday, September 11, 2012",Rifles,Saiga                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I have for sale a Saiga-M rifle in .223 Remington. This is not a VEPR from MOLOT, but a Saiga from the famous Izmash factory in Russia. Imported by the Russian American Armory Company. From what I've read, there were not a lot of these imported (around 5,000?) so they are somewhat rare, and not easy to find.
This is NOT like the Saiga rifles that you see sold for $349 on some websites or in gun shops.  If that's what you want, think this is the same as, or are looking for, keep moving please...

This is basically an unconverted modernized version of the Saiga sporting rifle/ carbines, but with a heavier receiver and barrel. I've been told the receiver is similar to that on an RPK strength-wise, but I don't know for sure.

This rifle has:

-heavy duty receiver with slant cut rear
-21"" hammer forged chrome-lined heavy barrel
- 300m rear sight leaf, standard AK type front post
-integrated side mount scope rail
-beautiful polished Walnut thumbhole stock with raised cheek rest, and rubber butt pad
-I've replaced the factory sling swivel mounts with Uncle Mike's studs and KNS 1.25"" sling swivels.

Rifle comes with:
(1) Saiga factory 10rd magazine
(1) SGM 10rd magazine
(1) SGM 15rd magazine

Unfortunately, it doesn't use .223 AK magazines, just mags made specifically for it and the other Saiga rifles. They're not uncommon, and I've found them for around $20-30 on the 'net, and you can buy 10,15, 20, or even 30 rounders.

This is an extremely nice rifle, and is a blast to shoot. It is accurate, and even though the factory guarantees a 3 MOA  @ 100yds accuracy, I've shot a 2 MOA group @ 100yds with iron sights, and a 1.5 MOA group @ 200yds with a 4-16x40 scope, both from benchrest.

I figure this would make someone a nice hunting rifle, or just a good all around rifle for that matter with the very common .223 cartridge. I've had it to the range maybe 4-5 times, and put probably 200-300 rds through it, with no jams, misfeeds or FTE's. Eats any ammo I feed it with no problem. Has some very minor surface blemishes and scratches, mostly from the safety. I think it has very nice flowing lines, and still captures the classic look and function of an AK.

I'm asking for $475 cash, and I'm pretty firm on that, but I am a reasonable guy and I may do a little negotiating on price. Make an offer, all I can say is no. I'm not really in a hurry to sell, just making room in the safe.

FTF transaction, FL resident, ID required, and a CCW is a bonus. As for travel, I live around Eustis/Mt. Dora, but I'm in the Lake Mary/Sanford area daily. I will not travel more than 20-25 miles from home for a deal.

If you're interested, contact me through this site.

Thanks for looking!"

Please understand that I've done a lot of soul searching and even more research. Every person has their feelings on the matter, but what it boils down to is that this is an ad NOT a forum. While I respect every firearm owner’s opinion and their right to have one, to that same regard, I would hope that you would respect mine. Please do not respond with advice rather than a genuine offer or question about the firearms listed.***



  This is a large majority of my firearms collection. I have decided to consolidate after realizing that I am only one man and can only shoot one gun at a time. To the same respect, I'm looking to shoot more often on fewer platforms. Restricting myself to only higher quality, higher end pieces. If I diminish my collection from many to few, I want those few to be the very best out there at what they do. I like to think of myself as a VERY diverse shooter. I enjoy the sport of shooting and am open to many different venues, situations, and purposes: Home Defense, Competition, Target, Etc. With that being said...My goal is to trade up, not to sell. I have no problem offering multiple firearms in exchange for one, as long as the VALUE and QUALITY is there. Every firearm I own is in excellent condition or brand new. Nothing on this list is below 95%+ condition and most are way above (unless noted). The prices listed next to each piece are fair middle ground prices. I could start high with the expectation to be bartered with, but why not skip all the BS and cut to the chase. Please do not contact me expecting to be able to pay the lowest price listed, as again, I'm not really looking to sell. I understand that due to location and demographic, the values I have listed may be lower or higher then what is available in your area. I would like to think I am a reasonable person. If you believe I'm too low or too high please let me know and depending on what you're offering we may be able to work something out. I'm not in any hurry to get rid of any piece so please no low ball offers. I'm looking for straight value for value here. If you believe your offer to have higher than expected value, please explain why. That is why I'm here, to get the best of the best.



What I'm looking for:



1911's (for carry, competition, HD, etc)... Brands I'm interested in: Wilson Combat, Nighthawk Custom, Les Baer, Ed Brown, Colt, Dan Wesson. 



AR-15 Platform (anything from LD, to target, to tactical)... Brands I'm interested in: Noveske, POF, Les Baer, Colt, Sabre, BCM, LMT



Creative Platforms that I have interest in: Kriss Vector .45 ACP, Styer AUG, Barrett long distance target, Grizzly Big Boar .50BMG, FN PS90, FN FS2000, FN FiveSeven, Kel-Tec KSG 12Ga, Kel-Tec RFB, Volquartsen .22 & .17



I am an experienced shooter, but I'm far from an expert. I ALWAYS love learning about new firearms and platforms. If you have a firearm that isn't listed above, but think it meets the expectations of what I'm looking for, then please tell me about it and I would be happy to do some research.

Please understand that I've done a lot of soul searching and even more research. Every person has their feelings on the matter, but what it boils down to is that this is an ad NOT a forum. While I respect every firearm owner’s opinion and their right to have one, to that same regard, I would hope that you would respect mine. Please do not respond with advice rather than a genuine offer or question about the firearms listed.***



  This is a large majority of my firearms collection. I have decided to consolidate after realizing that I am only one man and can only shoot one gun at a time. To the same respect, I'm looking to shoot more often on fewer platforms. Restricting myself to only higher quality, higher end pieces. If I diminish my collection from many to few, I want those few to be the very best out there at what they do. I like to think of myself as a VERY diverse shooter. I enjoy the sport of shooting and am open to many different venues, situations, and purposes: Home Defense, Competition, Target, Etc. With that being said...My goal is to trade up, not to sell. I have no problem offering multiple firearms in exchange for one, as long as the VALUE and QUALITY is there. Every firearm I own is in excellent condition or brand new. Nothing on this list is below 95%+ condition and most are way above (unless noted). The prices listed next to each piece are fair middle ground prices. I could start high with the expectation to be bartered with, but why not skip all the BS and cut to the chase. Please do not contact me expecting to be able to pay the lowest price listed, as again, I'm not really looking to sell. I understand that due to location and demographic, the values I have listed may be lower or higher then what is available in your area. I would like to think I am a reasonable person. If you believe I'm too low or too high please let me know and depending on what you're offering we may be able to work something out. I'm not in any hurry to get rid of any piece so please no low ball offers. I'm looking for straight value for value here. If you believe your offer to have higher than expected value, please explain why. That is why I'm here, to get the best of the best.



What I'm looking for:



1911's (for carry, competition, HD, etc)... Brands I'm interested in: Wilson Combat, Nighthawk Custom, Les Baer, Ed Brown, Colt, Dan Wesson. 



AR-15 Platform (anything from LD, to target, to tactical)... Brands I'm interested in: Noveske, POF, Les Baer, Colt, Sabre, BCM, LMT



Creative Platforms that I have interest in: Kriss Vector .45 ACP, Styer AUG, Barrett long distance target, Grizzly Big Boar .50BMG, FN PS90, FN FS2000, FN FiveSeven, Kel-Tec KSG 12Ga, Kel-Tec RFB, Volquartsen .22 & .17



I am an experienced shooter, but I'm far from an expert. I ALWAYS love learning about new firearms and platforms. If you have a firearm that isn't listed above, but think it meets the expectations of what I'm looking for, then please tell me about it and I would be happy to do some research.

They were Extremely rare variations of the Russian Nagant revolvers which had a Shortened frame and barrel and these were issued to N.K.V.D. officers and special agents.
What makes this gun even cooler is it has been hard chrome plated and the barrel shortened even more making it a snub nose. The sight was removed and the barrell professionally cut shorter and the front sight reinstalled. It is a great shooter and the 7 shot capacity makes it even more fun and better equipped for a carry gun. 
I know that these can be bought new for around 150.00 in the standard long barrel but the fact it has been made into a snub nose and chrome plated I think is definately worth the extra 100 bucks Im asking over the typical Nagant,
Due to the gas block cylinder design this gun could be suppressed or silenced and is the only revolver i know of due to the normal cylinder air gap on all others that makes the nagant the only revolver made that can be suppressed and since you wouldnt have to pick up the empty brass just imagine the coolness of such a suppressed revolver. Ive shot a couple of suppressed nagants and they are truly way more quiet than a semi auto because you dont hear the noise of the slide.

The chrome has some spots that are not perfect. I would rate the gun at probally 75 percent but it is good and tight and the timing perfect and shoots a good tight group

Only about 200 rounds through it. I bought it for plinking and small game hunting, but have decided to go in a different direction. 

Think Ruger Single Six quality with a 10 round capacity and updated sights.

I've installed a scope mount but it can easily be removed to allow the rear Williams Fire optic, adjustable sight to be reinstalled. Easily can do this with a few basic tools in less than 5 minutes. 

The Single Tens are selling locally for $500 plus tax ($37.5) without the optics mount ($40). The cheapest I've found them online, without mount, is roughly $510 OTD including FFL transfer. It would be $550 with mount. 

The only reason I'm considering selling it, is that the money will go towards funing another purchase. 

Included is everything shown in box. Would like a FTF sell, but will consider alternatives if willing to work with me.

Most were made to be sold commercially, but I'm sure some were used by the Communist Hungarian police forces for the walking beat cop. The caliber is the key, .32acp, up until the mid-1970's the ""common"" police caliber in most of Europe. The F.E.G. PA-63 in 9x18mm Makarov was supposed to have been a Hungarian Military sidearm only.

The M620C Scout Light® attaches by means of an Swing-Lever™ rail clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. Its small size increases weapon maneuverability, increases rail space available for other accessories, and minimizes added weight. It uses a high-efficiency LED emitter, virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break, and a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to create a beam with good reach and significant peripheral light for close- to medium-range applications. Maximum output is 200 lumens, and it produces tactical-level light—more than enough to temporarily overwhelm the night-adapted vision of an aggressor—for over two hours per set of batteries. The M600C has two switch options: (1) a pushbutton tailcap switch: press for momentary on, press further to click constant-on; (2) a momentary-on tape switch with a 7-inch cable that attaches to your preferred location  Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for maximum light transmission, the M600C is O-ring sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture. Battle-tested, built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black. See Pictures for SR07
The SR07 provides remote activation for any SureFire WeaponLight with a switch socket. Two switches—a momentary-on pressure pad switch and a constant-on pushbutton switch—are integrated with a snap-on clamp for easy attachment to your firearm's Picatinny rail forend. The seven-inch cable length works with most rifle/carbine applications. 


Fits: Rifles, carbines, or submachine guns with a Picatinny rail on the forend. (See our Picatinny Rail Forends to equip your weapon with multiple integral forend rails.)

The M951XM07 Millennium® Universal WeaponLight is a 6-volt (two-battery) WeaponLight that attaches by means of an integral dual thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. The compact, shock-isolated incandescent lamp/reflector assembly produces a tactical-level beam with good reach and excellent peripheral light, perfectly suited for interior and close-range applications. It produces 65 lumens for one-hour of runtime using the P60 lamp assembly (included) or 120 lumens for 20 minutes using the P61 lamp assembly (optional). The tailcap switch assembly features a momentary/constant-on pushbutton switch and a momentary-on tape switch (7-inch cable) also includesFM63
The FM63 is an infrared (IR) filter for flashlights and WeaponLights with a 1.47"" diameter bezel. Cancels out the non-infrared portion of the light spectrum to produce a smooth beam of infrared light for use with night vision devices and infrared-capable video cameras. For military or law enforcement infrared applications, SureFire also recommends the M1 Illuminator, as its dedicated infrared design may be more appropriate for mission critical tasking. Applying thumb pressure to the locking tab releases the cover; a spring mechanism keeps the open cover out of the way by holding it flat against the flashlight. A cam-locking lever keeps the entire unit securely attached to the flashlight. This filter is listed for $110.00. the total value is 490.00"
