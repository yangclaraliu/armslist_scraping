I took the cheap  factory buttstock off and replaced it with a very nice Israeli made Mako one that has  an adjustable cheek riser and rubber recoil pad, added an ATI Advanced Technologies 5 position Forend Pistol grip, nice custom bubble level in an aircraft grade aluminum scope ring added behind elevation knob of scope (no canting means your shot is perfectly centered) also UTG rail covers all along the bottom of the rail....
  This thing is wicked fast and you can take a deer at 110 plus yards with it as it doesn't have a rail ....it uses a D loop like a bow plus a Whisker Biscuit to achieve its speed and incredible accuracy. Built in crank only needs about 10-15 lbs of force to cock / decock....yes you don't need to fire an arrow, you simply pull out arrow and crank it down!
  Paid 1,500 for crossbow plus 3 arrows....I have 5 arrows + stuck almost $200 of custom accessories into it..
Always kept in case until I got into my blind, never dragged through trees, dropped or abused - kept strings conditioned with Dalton conditioner/wax and used Whisker Biscuit spray to eliminate friction, preserve the Whisker Biscuit and increase arrow velocity a bit. I will include spray with the crossbow.
Asking $1,325  and will ship to 48 states unless not permitted by law in your state, will only charge actual shipping/supplies charge .....Need to come up with rent deposit and I have two other high end Barnett crossbows I can use....

This was another imported rifle, in this case from Austria.  Nearly 100,000 of 
these were imported by the Confederate forces, and when the North saw the 
success of the new armament, they brought in 225,000, mainly to keep them out of 
the hands of the Southern forces.  
 
The Lorenz was lighter and more compact than either the Springfield or the Enfield rifle musket. 

Here's a near relic Civil War Austrian Lorenz Carbine. This is Austrian Model 1842 Carbine. The .71 caliber barrel is 14 1/2 inches long that originally had 12 groove rifling, overall length 30”, weight 5lbs 10oz. There are no markings left on the lock plate. The lock holds at 1st and 2nd cock and the spring is solid/strong. Union purchasing agent George Schuyler acquired 10,000 of these carbines in Bohemia in late 1861. Arriving in early 1862, they were immediately issued to Fremont's Western Command and used until better arms became available, they were placed in storage and sold after the war.

This short size for use by mounted trooper. The carbine was designed to hang across his front attached to a body sling so it could be used with right arm only, tensioning the weapon against the right shoulder leaving the left hand free to guide the horse.
Some quantities of these COULD have been imported for the Civil War however great quantities were imported later in the 1800s as surplus. It is an interesting weapon.

I received this huge gun as part of an estate. I cannot attest to the round count but I can say the last owner was meticulous in his ways and the condition is very good. I examined the gun completely and found only a couple handling marks on the gun. I would therefore rate the gun 9/10. As for the scope, I found two tiny dings on the height adjuster caps. The optics appear flawless and scratch free. 
The barrel is 7.5 inches. Includes gun, scope, scope covers, and case.
I tried to take the best pics I could to include as much detail as possible.
I want to own a high caliber pistol but this is way too much for a city boy like me. I seek a trade for some high end pistol. Revolvers, automatics, all good for me, if the value is similar.

For Sale is a used Century Polish Tantal with one black polymer 30 round mag (magazine has metal latches to lock into the magwell, not plastic).  
I bought this a year ago from a gun show when I decided to switch to the AK platform from the AR.  I loved the AK, but I am in the process of moving and I need the funds from this to go towards the move. I have another ak74 that is staying with me, but I need to get rid of one of them sadly.
This gun is crazy fun, just to go out for the day and shoot 500 rounds of surplus for $60, or all 1080 rounds per can for $139.  Because of the 5.45mm bullet the recoil is very light and again, this thing is so much fun to shoot.  If you want a fun and cheap gun and ammo to shoot when you go to the range, then this is your rifle!  
This rifle is in ""Good"" condition and has seen about 2 surplus cans through it.  This Tantal has always worked for me while having fun at the range (no FTFs or FTEs)."

The Custom Grade edition is limited to only 1,000 rifles, giving this model enduring collector appeal for generations to come. The first 1,000 High Grade rifles are offered as a matched set with the Custom Grade model. The right side of the scroll engraved richly blued receiver displays a portrait of John Wayne holding his trademark Model 92, along with his initials and a banner with the words “Courage, Strength, Grit,” the core moral values he embodied. John Wayne’s gold signature graces the short 18½"" barrel. 

The second rifle is the High Grade - a limited edition of only 4,000 rifles, each highly embellished with delicate scroll engraving and fond reminders of Duke, and is certain to be treasured for generations to come. The large loop lever is designed for fast action, while the rear carbine ladder sight and brass front blade puts you right on target. The first 1,000 of these impressive rifles are offered as part of a matched set with the Custom Grade model. The right side of the scroll engraved silver nickel nitride receiver features John Wayne’s portrait, his initials and a flowing banner with the words “Courage, Strength, Grit.” The deeply blued loading gate and action screws lend an extra touch of elegance to this very special commemorative rifle. John Wayne’s silvered signature graces the short 18½"" barrel. The ladder style carbine rear sight is fully adjustable. Two silver nickel nitride barrel bands match the receiver. Left side of the scroll engraved silver nickel nitride receiver displays two portraits of John Wayne, along with a banner that reads “John Wayne American, 1907-2007,” all richly accented by a deeply blued saddle ring, trigger and hammer. 
•This set comes with a locking Winchester Case. 
•Distressed leather look on the outside and browning lining on the inside. 
•This locking case has Velcro straps to secure your firearm in place. 
•Comes with belts to “wrap” the case securely closed.

It has never been used apart from attaching it to my lower from time to time.  

My original philosophy of use was for home defense, but my current living situation does not make that as practical as a handgun.  That of course does not mean that one could not use it for such things.  From the forums and gun shops, I heard the recoil was minimal, and this seems like a good piece of equipment.  It has a 20"" barrel, but does not have a carry handle.  It does, however, have a flip-up rear sight.

The .410 upper comes with the following: 

1x5 rd mag 
2x13 rd mags.
Approximately 250 rds of target load 
20 rds of 000 buckshot 
20 rds of slugs.

With further researching, I see this bike is an Chinese made bike -- made in 2003 by JIANSHE and is the ""FLYWING"" line of bikes. It also turns out they also have a partnership venture going with Yamaha too in Chongqing, China. If you look at the Yamaha PW80/100 body and look at this bike's body. some of the parts are interchangable witht the pw80/100. This dirtbike suprised me it runs like a spotted ape. It will do almost 50mph. All it needs is a tube for the rear tire. Im tryin to get on the PD so im looking to trade for a pistol. My preference is a glock 40 caliber. I would entertain other glock, sig, and other trades let me know what you have thanks for looking"

I just obtained this in a trade with a former police officer in my hometown. 

The rifle is a MKE-94 in 9mm with a 16 inch non-threaded barrel. The finish on the firearm is 95+ with wear only visibly under where the buttstock mates with the receiver. The firearms is in good working condition and very clean, I have NOT fired it at all, it was obtained in a trade 2 days ago and does not have any round count thru me. The BBL rifling is sharp and clean and all internals are clean and oiled.

I was told this was one of the first generation imports by MKE and DOES take hi-capacity magazines, a very rare feature, unlike the new imports that are limited to 10 rounds. I was also given 4 magazines which I will include in the deal as well. These are: (2)MKE magazines 10 and 20 rounder, and 2 other non-stamped magazines(1) 30 rounder and another 20 rounder.)

These a very Hi quality clone built under HK contracting in Turkey, and a very good rifle to add to your collection. 

These rifles are NO LONGER being imported, that it folks, they dried up. Take advantage of that.

I am asking 1900 cash or 2000  partial trade value for a LAR/AR/DPMS AR-10 in barebones and a couple of other rifles.

I will include Original Box, papers, (2) 20 round Magazines, (1) factory 10 round magazine and (1) 30 round magazine. The picture shows the MKE without the trigger pack, this is included with the factory gun. It was only removed for cleaning purposes.

As an import, all 922R laws apply, no lowballers, and FTF transactions in locality of Corpus Christi only, Bill of sale will be provided. 

Any trades, please offer and I will let you know if it interests me or not.

If interested or any questions, just contact me and I will respond very promptly. I can send more pictures through email or phone."

The Micro Compact G.I. has a 3"" barrel and a framer that's smaller than an Officer's size frame, giving it a weight of just 33 ounces, and making it ideal for carry.
The frame and slide are forged steel, and are parkerized. The 3"" bull barrel is fully supported and ramped, and is also parkerized. Parkerizing gives the pistol a finish that's much tougher than anodizing.
The reddish-brown hardwood grips are stamped ""U.S."", and contrast attractively with the black parkerized pistol. 
The sights on the pistol are original G.I. style, with a low profile notched rear sight and low rounded front sight blade.
The grip safety is flat, just like the old G.I. 1911's, as is the trigger. Trigger pull on the Micro Compact G.I. is five to six pounds, which is a good pull weight for a carry pistol.
The Micro Compact G.I. 1911 is a pistol with a lot of character, and one that can fit in the palm of your hand. It comes with a lifetime warranty that's good even if you're not the original purchaser.

I have the rockchucker press, powder measure, powder scale, powder trickler, loading block, primer tray, case lube pad, resizing lubricant, burring tool, reloading manual, all the manuals, powder funnel, lots of little brushes and tools, almost a full box of small pistol primers, and 2 partial cans of powder. I think I have an extra reloading manual that I will throw in too. This all comes in a nice green wood ammo box. You will need to buy the correct die for the caliber you will be reloading.
I bought this stuff used about 3 years ago, because reloading was something I was interested in. I took all this out when I bought it to look at it, and it hasnt been out since. Just don't really have time to mess with it now. Ive got the bug right now to get another gun so I figured I would just try and trade it. 
I would like to note that when I got all this out to take pictures I noticed a little light surface rust on the main piston on the press. I was able to just wipe some of it off. So 5 minutes with a little oil and it would be like new again. No big deal just wanted to make anyone who wants to trade aware so there is no suprises. 
I'm interested in trades for firearms more specifically, WWII era guns (mosin-nagants, mausers, ect) lever guns, small caliber pistols or revolvers, just not really interested in shotguns. Let me know what you have. Thanks for looking"
