The second generation of the Sig Sauer P290 9mm microcompact pistol includes several new features based on consumer feedback.

The most noticeable change in the double-action-only P290 RS is a redesigned trigger that now offers  restrike (RS) capability. In event of an ammo failure, the operator now has the option to press the trigger a second time, or manually cycle the slide.

In addition to the new restrike trigger, a recountoured beavertail minimizes hammer-bite for shooters with larger hands.   

Finally, two control levers have been reshaped. The magazine release has been reduced and contoured to reduce any chance of an inadvertent disengagement. A new slide stop has been recontoured to enhance the comfort of shooters with larger hands.

FEATURES
- Lightweight sub-compact
- DAO Restrike Trigger
- Removable grip plates"

I will include both sets with the rifle.  Comes with 2 30rd mags and a sling. $850

For the buyer of this rifle, I can offer up to 3 sealed tins of Russian 5.45 ammo. Each tin has 1080 rounds of ammo and will be $230. I can do a package deal of the rifle and the 3 tins of ammo for $1500.
Price is firm, I have no problem putting her back in the safe.

I will only do face to face in Western PA. I do not want to ship. This will give the buyer the opportunity to examine the firearms before purchase.

With the way things are going lately, it is one hell of a hard time trying to get reasonably priced ammo.  Looking for 9mm, and not at the ridiculously inflated prices.  I know that tulammo sells their cheap target steel case stuff for 10 bucks.  Just seems that everytime a store gets a shipment, one person runs in buys every box, then tries to sell for 3-4 times that amount elsewhere.  Also would be open to other firearms, yeah good luck I know.  But wouldnt mind a lower end .22 LR of some sort.  Something that I do have ammo for, and can readily get at a normal price.  Anyhow, the axe is brand new never used, no longer in the plastic that it came in, but the blade and pick portion show zero wear.  Sheath is acu pattern and has attachments for molle setup.  The garmin watch is definitely used, but works perfectly.  Just dont use it as often as I had thought.  It shows distance, pace, elevation, can store waypoints, heart rate monitor and charger included.  No scratches on the face of the watch, the bezel has some wear, but still functions as new.  Each of these items average 100 bucks, the axe new brings that, and the watch used brings that amount.  Just let me know if interested.  Face to face transactions, and only in the Colorado Springs and immediate area."

Every visual detail, every sound, every action is documented for later analysis. The encrypted video/audio supercedes any questionable, conflicting or biased eyewitness accounts and can dramatically reduce personal, departmental and jurisdictional liability. Footage can also be used to help identify suspects who have managed to flee the scene. And the Shotcam, when removed from a weapon, can continue to provide video, still frames and audio of a crime scene and witnesses. An ultra-bright 120 lumen tactical illuminator and adjustable class IIIa laser add utility. And the compact, lightweight Shotcam™ is easily mounted to shoulder-fired weapons as well as tasers. Shotcam and other accessories mount easily to duty shotguns using the Burris Tri-Rail mount for magazine tube extensions. Shotcam is also proving invaluable as a weapons training tool. Shooting form can be analyzed at the precise moment of fire and shooters can use Shotcam for independent self-evaluation."

It was purchased within a week after the rifle and has never touched the ground. Below are the details and features of this rifle along with all of the upgrades that have been added to this rifle.

5. MAGPUL AFG - Angled Fore Grip

FEATURES
Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control.

FEATURES
The Magpul CTR (Compact/Type) – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability* and an ambidextrous QD sling mount that will accept any push-button sling swivel. The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

7. Hogue Rubber Grip Ar-15/M-16 Rubber Grip with Finger Grooves ( THIS ACCESSORY HASN'T BEEN ADDED TO THE RIFLE YET, BUT IS NEW AND STILL IN RETAIL PACKAGING. IT WILL BE INCLUDED IN SELL. )

FEATURES
Hogue rubber grips are molded from a durable synthetic rubber that is not spongy or tacky, but gives that soft recoil absorbing feel, without affecting accuracy. This modern rubber requires a completely different molding process than ordinary neoprene and results in a much superior grip. The material we use does not come apart or deteriorate and is resistant to all solvents and oils used around firearms. Hogue Grips give you a lasting precision fit and durability that will provide years of dependable service. The flexibility of our materials and molding process has allowed us to produce superior rubber grips with features that out perform all other makes.

It's been on my AR for 6 mo., but seen very little action.  Its in excellent condition.  Please e-mail if you would like to see more pics or have any questions.  Will ship and will take paypal. This sight is selling out most places and retails for well over $100. 

The A.R.M.S.® Stand Alone Flip-up sight, utilizes the same well proven concept as the rear sight on the SWAN® Sleeve system. The unique design of the spring loaded rear sight, ensures constant battery action and repeat zero. The sight is held in the locked down position by a quick release lever, that prevents the sight from being accidentally engaged, but is as fast as a trigger to release even with arctic mittens. The initial elevation zero utilizes the standard M16/M4 front sight bead. When the sight is released into battery the 250-300 meter aperture is ready for immediate close combat use.

For longer ranges the leaf sight aperture is rotated to access the 500-600capability with the built in horizon line feature that helps lead distant targets and lets the shooter square the rifle to counter windage offsets, if the rifle is inadvertently tilted. Other type rear iron fold-down sights require the shooter to push it into position, which means they can be accidentally knockeed down at the worst time. The A.R.M.S. spring loaded flip-up sights never let you down, because they're designed to always be there even when going thru brush or being dropped."

I can't hold onto this when I could be looking at money for our new house and wedding...   Well under pre ban scare pricing..

This rifle was built by my cousins army Sergeant and used on their army competition shooting team.  The lower is from RA in Fort Bragg. 

 It has a knights arm upper, 5.56/.223, a very nice 4-16x40 scope that lights up red or green.  It has flip up iron sights, and also a red dot sight on top that has changeable target icons.  The front handle has a button that springs out 2 bipod legs, and there is also a green laser sight underneath with a pressure switch on the handle.  This was rigged a tad because the replacement switch was too small.  These are about 7 bucks. It works though. 

It has a pelican 1700 case with cutouts for the mags and rifle, scope, etc. 

Comes with standard issued military cleaning kit and tools as well.  Has a nice rubber dark earth grip, original is included also.  Adjustable stock, clip on lanyard style strap, and a Surefire tactical light.  All sights have new batteries.  

There are 5 mags, 2 originals, and 3 with nice magpull grips on them new.  All are 30 round mags.

Beautiful rifle that had a lot invested in it.  Possible partial trades for a revolver. .22 to .50 interested.  Or a nice hunting rifle.

Also includes a laser bore sight which is a casing with a laser in it you chamber and can adjust your sights without wasting ammo.  It will get you on paper from the comfort of your own living room.

Shipping extra, very heavy gun, about 35 pounds packed up in the case.  Would probably run around $50 2-3 day or 125+ overnight.

Sorry pictures kinda stink, if you want a super crisp high res email me and I'll get one to you."

Do your homework and decide for yourself.  $300 is a big chunk of cash.
