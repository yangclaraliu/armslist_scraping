I have since decided to sell one of them. One is unfired and the other has 60 rounds through it for function test (and then properly cleaned for corrosive ammo). You can pick which you like, but they are identical.
Anyways, they are the standard Century M74 with black plastic furniture, TAPCO trigger and other parts, 922 compliant with foreign magazines, etc. I added an ATI pistol grip (which is light years ahead of the standard grip) and picatinny rail (that mounts via standard AK style mounting pad that is riveted to the left side of the receiver). The rifle has the cleaning rod, bayo lug, screw-on AK74 style compensator/flash hider. I am including THREE proper (bulgarian?) magazines; not cheap TAPCO mags that do not fit correctly. The stock is also black plastic and is a tad longer than the typical AK47 wooden stock according to my judgment. It fits better, IMHO, unless you are wearing plates.
Yes, I have ammo, but it's cheap to buy right now, so I am not including any. You can buy milsurp in 1080 round spam cans for ~$135 according to my favourite ammo sites. Magazines are hard to come by though; that's why I am throwing in an additional pair beyond what the guns come with.
I am in central Ohio and will drive a little bit if necessary. Price is cash only to a 21 year old Ohio resident. I prefer CCW Licensee. If you have more questions please feel free to ask. Only trades I would consider are gold/silver, Saiga 12 or S&W 5.45x39 AR upper.
If you need more, I can also offer a package that includes ammo and a .50 Cal can, or more mags, but only to someone that buys the rifle. I will sell the ammo at replacement cost (only selling so you don't have to waste time waiting on ammo to shoot it) and mags at ~$20 apiece.

Trigger isn't even close to broken in.

I bought this directly from Bushmaster as a complete upper, and that's just what it is today. This Upper is sold complete with Bolt, Bolt Carrier and Charging Handle to ensure positive lockup between bolt and barrel extension, and correct factory headspacing.

This upper has been cleaned after every firing and taken care of well. Round count is approximately 300-500 as it split a case of 1000 with another upper.

I'm willing to pay between $300-400 cash if the rifle is in pristine condition as this is the fair market value  (especially for post-64 models - remember, Winchester made 7 million of these so they're not exactly rare). If you have a safe queen or a Win 94 that has been used but well cared for then please contact me with pictures and a price and we can go from there. By 'pristine condition' I mean that the wood is walnut (not the cheap birch stock version), has no visible dings, dents or signs of pitting/rust. Serious inquiries only. This will be my first Winchester 94, hence the reason why I want something nice. I've searched gunbroker.com and several local gunshops, all of which are selling these rifles for inflated prices.

Seriously, I've got a lovingly cared for, ugly little step-child, a perfect copy of the gun that single handedly rejuvenated the US micro-compact market and still stands out as one of the lightest, slimmest, most practical, and most reliable in the pack, the Kel-Tec P-3AT.

My copy does in fact have around 500 rounds through it with no malfunctions of any kind, which is no small feat for ANY of the micro-compacts on the market.  It's in great condition, with just the tiniest bit of lightening of the slide finish at a couple places to indicate it's been carried--hardly noticeable.  Otherwise it looks brand new.

The guide rod and springs have been recently replaced, and I have 3 mags, all with +1 baseplates as well as the original floorplates.  I have 4 premium holsters, all in great condition: ankle, inside-the-pocket, inside-the-wiaistband, and paddle.  You can have it all--I've joined the revolver nation for the remainder of the winter, and will probably go with a 9mm this spring.  My baby is moving on to a new home.

Also, I have the original receipt, which you can take with you (Kel-Tec firearms all come with a lifetime warrantee.).  You get the case, all the paperwork, everything that came with it.  Hell, I'll even give you a few boxes of ammo.  What do I care?!?  :)  Basically, this is like a super pocket pistol package.  What are you waiting for?"

Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked ""Colt Grizzly / 357 Magnum"". The serial number is found on the frame under the arbor and on the arbor. The right side of the barrel is marked ""Colt's Pt. F.A. Mfg. Co. Hartford Conn. U.S.A."". The Rampant logo is on the left side of the frame.

Stock Configuration & Condition: The stock(s) is/are rubber with ""COLT"" logo. The grips are in good condition with a few minor marks. 

Type of Finish: Stainless 

Finish Originality: All original. 

Bore Condition: The rifling is sharp and deep. The bore is bright. There is some minor fouling which should clean up well. . There is no apparent erosion. 

Overall Condition: This gun retains about 95% of its metal finish. The balance of the finish shows just some minor wear, primarily from storage. There is a visible dragline on the cylinder. There are a few minor and nearly invisible surface scratch marks on the left side of the frame and on the cylinder. The Screw heads are sharp and undamaged. The markings are clear.

Our Assessment: This is one of those great ""like a Python"" .357 Magnums from Colt. With an unfluted cylinder, ported barrel and full length rib, this gun should be quite a shooter. The rifling is great and the balance is very nice. This is the hunting camp plinker, defense, target, competition revolver, and its all here. Attention California Colt revolver collectors. This is private party transferable in California.

This baby include: Leapers/UTG 6-position Stock with aluminum tube, ATI Strikeforce Pistol Grip, Tromix Extended Bolt Handle, Leapers 5-Position Pistol Foregrip, Tapco G2 modified Trigger group, New CSS Trigger-guard,hammer interface polished and treated with Militec-1, polished bolt, gas ports checked, Leapers/UTG Saiga 12 see through Quad Rail made from billet aluminum(shown with long top rail comes with a short top rail too and rail covers), CSS reduced power mainspring, CSS High Efficiency Gas Puc and MD adjustable Gas Valve (the spring, puc and adj.valve allow for positive cycling with low brass and should be on any true conversion. This shotgun will run all 2-3/4in and 3in shells low as well as high brass). Barrel has a polychoke II choke/muzzlebrake/breecher. Included is a Promag 20rd drum professionally fitted for this gun, 1- Factory 5rd magazine plus original factory items (stock, box, instructions and cleaning kit.)

Compare; most of these so called converted saiga 12's out there just have the screw-on Tapco Saiga stock/pistol grip combo or just a trigger job, cheap mags, cut-down factory trigger-guard, etc. They are junk and good luck firing different types of ammo through them. This baby is the real deal and has only been function tested (20 rounds).

There is one dent in the buttstock, a few scrapes and scratches from normal wear and tear, but overall the finish is terrific.  

Engraving is very nice, and I was told that it's probably hand done.  I believe that the barrels can handle steel shot, but the chokes would need to be opened in order to do so.  This is a perfect pheasant or trap gun!  I don't use it, so it needs to go."

Draco AK47 Pistol, chambered in 7.62x39.

Pistol comes with PWS muzzle brake, Hogue pistol grip, pistol grip sling attachment point, UTG quad rail, Magpul AFG (yes it is perfectly legal to have the AFG on a pistol as verified by the BATFE), Magpul rail sling attachment point, BlackHawk single point sling and your choice of 3 steel 30rd mags or 3 Tapco 30rd mags

Over $800 invested in this bad boy, $750 gets it.

Bottom of the pic shows a Norinco Mak90 Sporter in 7.62x39.  Bore is clean and overall shape is excellent.  This gun has been on armslist a number of times, first when I bought it with a terrible camo paint job.  It has since been stripped and refinished, comes with 6 position Tapco stock, Midwest Industries quad rail, High quality vertical grip with pressure switch panels, low profile red dot and your choice of 3 steel 30rd mags or 3 Tapco 30rd mags.

Well over $975 invested into this guy, $850 gets this one.

You must be legally eligible to purchase and own these firearms in CO, FTF only in this state.

I have some bills due and I hate to get rid of this."
