I probably have around 400-425 dollars worth of money in this package, and i am only asking 350 for it all. I am not looking to trade at the moment, thanks!

Why some scopes lose their zeros and some don't?
Rule #1 is: In order for a scope to lose its zero, something between the reticle and the target must move.
Rule #2 is: In order to see what moved you need two reticles, each one to track the other.


The old type German scopes put the cross hair in the front focal plane. They hardly ever lost their zeros because the only thing between the reticle and the cross hair was the objective lens. The drawback was that the reticle magnified when zoomed and blocked out long-range targets. Americans put the reticle in the rear focal plane where it would not magnify. The main drawback with this was that it put about three more lenses between the reticle and the target. The American system was then three times more likely to lose its zero. The American was more convenient but the German system was more reliable.

Shepherd Rifle Scope gives you the best of both worlds with the drawbacks of neither. Sheperd uses the front focal plane location for rangefinding and bullet drop compensating circles. This gives Shepperd Scope the German dependability and, when zoomed, the circles do not block the targets but instead frame them and give you instant target engagement on any power. Then put the cross hair in the rearfocal plane (where the Americans do) in order to get the benefits of a nonmagnifying reticle. This patented Dual Reticle System lets each reticle monitor the other and thus allows for: one shot zeroing in, ""at a glance"" verification of the original zero, and visual confirmation of windage and elevation adjustments before you shoot. The Shepherd is truly the most reliable of all and the only one to tell you if something is out of zero before you shoot."

Here is a little history on them,

The FEG P9R is the derivative of the earlier FEG P9 pistol. Both guns are made in Hungary by the FEGARMY Arms factory (formerly known as Fegyver es Gazkeszuelekgyara NV). The P9R uses the modified P9 frame and action, but the classic FN GP-35 Single Action trigger system is replaced with Smith & Wesson Double Action system. In Europe the FEG P9R was also known as the Mauser 90DA, as it was imported and distributed through the famous German Mauser organization.

The P9R is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. The barrel is operated using a Browning cam system, and is locked to slide by three locking lugs on the top of the barrel, which fit into mated recesses on the inside of the slide, just ahead of the ejection port. Frame and slide are made from carbon steel and have blued finish. The Double Action trigger system with external hammer has a slide-mounted safety lever, which also works as a de cocker when safety is engaged. The front sight is permanently fixed to the slide, while rear sight is dovetailed."

Crimson Carry pistols feature Crimson Trace Lasergrips in an exclusive rosewood finish with the classic 1911 double diamond checkering pattern and the Kimber logo. Lasergrips promote faster shooting, positive target acquisition and are tremendous training aids.

Custom touches include a recessed slide stop pin and elegant two-tone non-reflective finish. Crimson Carry frames are machined from solid bricks of premium aluminum-dramatically reducing weight for easier carry. Match grade triggers break crisp and clean.

Little things make a big difference in performance. Kimber pistols are enhanced
with custom features like an extended thumb safety lever with deep serrations
for positive grip and Commander-style hammers that will not cut or snag.

Having confidence in a carry pistol is critical. Dependability and accuracy proven through repeated practice increases confdence. Crimson Trace Lasergrips project a bright red dot downrange, an important aid in training. Reading the dot immediately shows the advantage of proper grip and trigger control, which can dramatically improve accuracy and reduce time between shots for any level of shooter. Crimson Carry pistols come with Crimson Trace Lasergrips; the finest laser sight available today. Combining that advantage with Kimber quality makes Crimson Carry pistols an unbeatable value. Offered in three sizes, they are ideal for law enforcement, home defense or concealed carry.

Features:

    The Custom Crimson Carry II has a 5-inch match grade barrel and match grade barrel bushing.
    The Pro Crimson Carry II and Ultra Crimson Carry II have bushingless match grade bull barrels fitted directly to the slide.
    Crimson Trace Lasergrips are activated by a pressure pad just below the trigger guard at the front of the grip.
    Lasergrips are a $359 value when purchased separately. They are powered by two #2032 lithium batteries with over 4 hours run time.

In 2001, DPMS expanded from its share of the .223/5.56mm market, and exploded onto the .308 rifle scene. The LR-308, the first and foremost of the .308 line, and for which the rifle series is named, is a rifle to be reckoned with. So much so that it was named the NRA Rifle of the year in 2005.
With a 24” stainless bull barrel, 1 in 10 twist and free floating handguard and a flat top receiver for easier mounting of optics, the LR-308 has gone toe to toe with bolt action rifles and delivered comparable accuracy, with higher magazine capacity and rate of fire. The conventional thought that ""only a bolt action could be considered a precision rifle"" has been in contention ever since.
This rifle features several factory installed modifications including replacing the slick side high rise upper receiver with an A3 upper receiver with forward assist, shell deflector and dust cover. Installing a JP adjustable trigger in place of the standard trigger, changing the A2 grips for panther tactical grips, replacing the vented free float tube for the standard free float tube and swapping a black coated flutes bull barrel for the standard bull barrel.

For sale is a Taurus 85 Ultra-lite in brushed stainless. The gun is in good working condition, used occasionally as a carry piece. It is great for times when you need to slip a gun into the pocket or your S&W 500 just isn't discreet enough. It has a concealed hammer to avoid snagging on clothing. Bought a another carry gun thus the reason for the sale. This gun has served me well, but it needs a new home since all it does is gather dust in the safe. 

Package includes a Crossbreed J frame holster and 30 rounds of Remington 38 Special +P. It also includes a speed loader. 

I also have brass, ~200 TCFP 125 grain Missouri Bullets, lee dies for the reloader than can be included at additional price or separate. 

I am looking for cash or a S&W M&P 15-22. I am not interested in anything else. 

Buyer must have PP or CPL. Please contact via PM first with questions and offers. Can ship to FFL at buyer's expense."

The Walker revolver is one of the most famous revolvers made by Colt. It consists of a one piece grip and European walnut stock. The frame is steel, color casehardened. Barrel is a .44 caliber, blue 9"" octagon to round. Six shot. Features a blued steel backstrap, brass triggerguard, color casehardened loading lever & hammer. ""Fighting Dragoons"" scene engraved on cylinder. Manufactured by Uberti/Italy.

I have shot this gun, fun!! and was cleaned properly afterwards

FYI: The Colt Walker holds a powder charge of 60 grains (3.9 g) in each chamber, more than twice what a typical black powder revolver holds.
The Colt Walker was quite powerful, with modern replicas firing modern FFFg black powder producing energy levels in excess of 500 foot pounds with both picket bullets and 0.454-inch-diameter (11.5 mm), 141-grain (9.1 g) round ball bullets. The black powder Colt Walker is regarded as the most powerful commercially manufactured repeating handgun from 1847 until the introduction of the .357 Magnum in 1935, and has a muzzle energy nearly exactly the same as a 4-inch-barreled handgun firing a .357 Magnum. 1000-1200+ feet per second, effective range 100 Yards.

Dixie Gun Works are selling the Uberti 1847 for $375.00 plus shipping, just for reference
I will also include 1 pound of FFF powder and a Holster that matches this gun, right handed purchased from (Cabelas) (powder and holster a 50 $$ value)

Glock 22 is a .40 S&W version of the full-size Glock 17 introduced in 1990. The pistol uses a modified slide, frame, and barrel to account for the differences in size and power of the .40 S&W cartridge.
May be easily converted to the corresponding .357 SIG chambering (Glock 31, 32, and 33 respectively) simply by replacing the barrel. No other parts need to be replaced, as the .40 S&W magazines will feed the .357 SIG round.

Looking for a shooter, not a collector's item. Must have original chrome-lined Warsaw Pact milspec barrel from original manufacturer, no US-made barrels please. A WASR2 or SAR2 would be acceptable IF and only IF its sights and gas tube are straight and milsurp mags fit and feed properly, which are very big IFs with any Century product. Prefer to have the optics mount block on the left side of the receiver already installed. Prefer fixed stocks but willing to consider triangle folders or AK100 series folders if the price is right. No ""Planet of the Apes"" thumbhole sporters, please.  No single-stack guns, please.

I bought a Savage Palma Model 12 chambered in .308 as soon as they came out a few years ago, but I haven't shot it much and am ready to get rid of it. For exact specs on the gun, visit http://www.savagearms.com/firearms/model/12+PALMA (this is not my gun nor is it my picture or website, but it is 100% accurate to the specs on my gun). I have probably put 50-75 rounds through it. For the first 20 shots, I cleaned it after each shot to ensure its accuracy. I can personally say that it groups really well out to 600 yards, and I know very little about long range shooting, so it should do very well in the hands of someone who knows what they are doing. It has stayed in a Pelican Storm 3200 case except when at the range, so I will give its condition at 99%+. It has a Knight Force NXS 12-42X56mm scope with the titanium mounts from Knight Force. I still have the original box and parts for the scope, and the scope bikini is always on it to protect the lens. The stock and trigger are completely adjustable for fit and pull weight down to approximately 6oz. The butt is adjustable in every way one can imagine to ensure that it fits its owner properly. The rifle came with an Anschutz rail, so I bought the Harris HBR bipod for it and the adapter to make it fit this rail.

In all, the gun, scope, and bipod are all in very excellent/perfect like-new condition, I just don't need it anymore. It is extremely accurate at long distances (600 yards is as far as I've shot it, and it could group there even in the hands of a novice). I am looking to buy a custom stock out of Germany for my Perazzi MX8, so I need to sell this gun soon. You are welcome to come by and see it if you are in the area.

This sale includes the rifle, the scope, the scope mounts, the bipod, the bipod adapter, and any ammo I still have for the gun (should be anywhere between 20 rounds and 40 rounds). If you can come by to purchase it in person, I also have some miscellaneous reloading supplies that I will give away for free with this purchase including a brass case tumbler (possibly Frankford Arsenal). I estimate the reloading stuff to be worth around $100, and I have never reloaded, so they are all brand new. Any leftover used brass for .308 (~50 rounds) and 30-06 (~200 rounds) is also up for grabs with purchase of the gun.

The 3rd picture is below is exactly as my gun is set up but it has a different bipod. Mine is a Harris HBR bipod.

Any purchases out of state must be done through a registered FFL. I will only sell to adults who are legally allowed to own a firearm.

The SIG SAUER P232 is a small and lightweight pistol. Chambered in .380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P232 Stainless is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 23oz in the stainless version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today.

The new Benelli Vinci marks a revolution in hunting shotguns. Benelli presents the fastest-shooting, softest-kicking, most reliable lightweight 12-gauge shotgun in the world. The innovative design of this semi auto shotgun raises the standard in firearms technology. Driven by a passion for efficiency and simplicity, Benelli engineers have advanced the cutting edge. The superbly balanced Vinci embodies a new way of looking at shotgun design. The revolutionary new In-Line Inertia Driven® operating system, with superior reliability and lightning fast speed, is the simplest semi-auto shotgun operating system ever devised.

Advanced ergonomics assure fluid gun movement. Combine that with the ComforTech® Plus recoil reduction system, and Benelli puts in your hands the world’s softest-kicking shotgun. In recent lab tests, the competition had up to 72-percent more felt recoil than the Vinci. And, its modular design makes Vinci the easiest shotgun on the planet to assemble and disassemble. No wonder it’s named for Leonardo da Vinci, the great Italian Renaissance inventor, artist, and thinker who shattered the technological boundaries of his world. Let the revolution begin.

I have a Colt M4 AR15-22 Carbine, It has the removable carry handle with standard rear sight,If you take it off, then you have a pictanny rail top to mount optics. Comes with (2) 30 round magazines. Only fired about 500 rounds thru it, it likes any bulk .22 ammo with no issues at all. Really a fun gun to shoot cheap. This Little carbine is made just like it's big brother, Aluminum construction. Not like the plastic S&W toys.
I also have a Bushnell
Trophy Tactical T-Dot scope, that fits the M4. it has the rectical that can be changed from Red to Green and changable brightness levels.
