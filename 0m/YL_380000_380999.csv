The description is off the maker’s website (link below). The picture is also off their website but the one I have for sale is black. Cost me $60 and 6weeks wait I just don’t use it. It is unused

The R/C mag pouch essentially positions the spare magazine at an extreme rearward angle and is designed to be worn between your body center-line and the front pocket.  This works well for positioning gear forward of the hip points to optimize access for confined spaces, entanglement, and economy of motion.  Also for reloading off your back such as fending with an open guard or reloading in the bucket seats of a small vehicle.  From a regular standing untangled reload this mag pouch is extremely fast.  It’s like a competition pouch optimized for concealed carry, and hand placement is perfect!  This magazine holder is not for everyone, just those who want lightning fast reload capabilities.

The upper and lower receiver are by CMMG out of Fayette, MO.

Lower - Rock River 2-stage national match grade trigger assembly. Hogue pistol grip. Accu-wedge installed for a tight assembly.

Flat top upper - Full floating, chrome lined, 18"" DSG heavy barrel, full 1-9 twist, fluted for better heat dispersion, with low profile gas block, and flash suppressor. Picatinny quad rail with black inserts, TapCo bi-pod mount, and fully adjustable bi-pod. Magpul pop up front and rear sites. 1"" TapCo riser for optics mount so it doesn't interfere with or contact the pop ups. Enlarged charging handle release allows for easier and proper use of the charging handle while wearing gloves and/or while opics are mounted.

Optics - NcStar rubber armored Mark 3 tactical scope, 3-9x42, NV compatible, fully integrated and adjustable red dot laser, illuminated blue cross hairs with variable illumination settings, flip up lens covers, quick release mount. Walther Top Point holographic, red bullseye, ruby lens.

Just a note, I was told when I purchased the parts that the flash suppressor and quad rail were made by Surefire. However they're usually pretty proud of there stuff and like the free advertising of having their stamp on everything. Neither of these have a manufacturers stamp so I can't stand 100% behind that. This is a very solid firearm and I certainly would have no issues resting my life on the reliability of this rifle.

It has the 21 conversion and the wide a arms. It has the big joe wheels and tires 40 series. This tmaxx is a beast the motor on it has only had about 2 or 3 tanks through it since it was new. NOT GALLONS TANKS. I ran this thing last night with no problems whatsoever but it was pretty cold last night and it never skipped a beat then i tried running it today in the heat and if i gave it full throttle it would choke out and cutoff. I don't know rc that well but i started trying to adjust the carb. and well i guess i really don't know what I'm doing because it wouldn't run after I adjusted the screws. So I give up. It has a pull stater on it but it does come with a high torque battery powered starter but i dont have a battery charger to charge the pack. It takes a standard 6 cell 7.2 volt pack if im not mistaken. The gallon of fuel was 30 bucks and the fuel bottle and glowplug igniter are new as off yesterday. This truck stripped the spur gear on the first tank of gas after break in and it sat for a while so I put on the new spur gear and set the mesh correctly and like i said last night it was flawless and today it wouldn't go wide open for nothing it just wanted to bog. The 3 bodies and everything pictured goes with the truck. this is a used item and should be treated as such. Any questions text or call 803 7 two nine eight nine 2 five.

The gun is a lever action rifle with a 26"" octagon barrel in the very popular 45-70 caliber. All the mechanics are tight, work well, shoots great and is still very accurate due to the good rifling still present. Overall condition as appraised in NRA ""GOOD"" condition.
FYI; Appraised by two long time dealers in person, one in Northern CA and One in Northern Nevada and both gave same verbal appraisal at $10,000. Furniture has no cracks or chips and there are no dents in the magazine tube. Original finish with naturally occuring patina and receiver has silvered with very little case coloring present in protected areas like inside receiver on base of the hammer and on underside of lever that is protected up in the receiver when closed.

Known History; I purchased this 12 years ago (Feb 2000) from a collector/dealer who had just bought a wealthy family estate gun collection out of southern california (do not know the family name). As this gun shows, it has been well taken care of even though it has been used over the last 125+ years - as it should of been. 

Notes; Has been drilled, tapped and screw placed for a long range sight (not included).

It was made locally by Chuck Faught in late 2009. Features include a leather wrap, 12mm shaft topped with a wizard tip. The thread pattern is the same as Predator Pool Cues 3/8 by 16. I have a hard case and joint protectors that come with it. It was only used as a shooting stick for about 10 or 12 games total. I had never broke with this cue. It is in like new/perfect condition. Its similar to a regular house stick with the dark wood and the crown perspective but a 2 piece with several different colors in it. This is a basically brand new stick that is valued over $500. I just have more sticks than I use and just don't have much time to shoot anymore."

It is famous, not because it was the top of the line Remington bolt action rifle (it wasn't).  It is famous for its SUPERB accuracy.  This is partly due to it's excellent trigger and very SHORT lock time.  
   (It was rumored that Remington discontinued this model because it consistently outshot their excellent Rem model 700.  It was making their own top of the line bolt action look bad).  I don't know for sure, but I do know, many winning competition rifles have been built on this excellent action.
   This rifle is chambered for .22-250 Rem cal.  This is an extremely fast and accurate round.  This would make an outstanding coyote and varmit rifle.  With the right ammo, it would be good for deer as well.

Morning classes 8:30 AM to noon and evenings at 6:30 to 10:00 PM. The shooting will be Saturday, noon to 4:00 PM.  Great for second and third shift workers.

Cost of the training is $100 cash or check, collected on the first day of class. Unique to the CCW training at sheepdog2warrior is that every student is given the opportunity to fire a suppressor (silencer) equipped handgun during the live fire training.

Our dedicated classroom is located at 5837 Sawmill Road in Dublin, Ohio. The class descriptions can be viewed on www.sheepdog2warrior.com. The State of Ohio requires 10 hours of classroom training and 2 hours of live fire training. We do not wish to be state minimum anything. Our training is set in four 3.5 hour modules that can be held in a morning, evening, or multiples in one day.

Sheepdog2warrior has recently leased nine acres of wooded land near Columbus, where we can hold live fire training. This range is private, thus we do not have to wait for others to complete training or share the range with someone another class.

Notice to the man who called us during the middle of the night and told us to take the tractor off Armslist, telling us that Armslist is for guns only, and then threatened us with ""If you don't [take it off], it's gonna be a long night."" and then hung up:  Jesus Christ loves you.  We don't know what hurts, pains, sins, or sorrows are in your life - but only He can and will save you for this life and all eternity and comfort you now.  We urge you to trust Him.

This gun has standard glock fixed sights but I've added what matters most to me, a clean, crisp ghost trigger at 3.5lbs and a stainless steel guide rod and spring which adds a couple extra ounces up front to reduce flip up and provides smoother cycling.  This one has a round count of around 600 with modest smileys on the barrel.  No problems with this gun as it's fed plenty of FMJ and many types of JHP self defense ammo.  Three 13 round mags come with it and a Serpa holster.  With the extras, this gun easily passes the $600 investment mark but I'm asking $500 for it.

Second is my open carry gun, a .40 caliber Glock 22.  This gun has glock night sights installed and they're still plenty bright. Like the G23 it also has the Ghost Inc. Ultimate trigger kit installed and has a very smooth 3.5lb trigger.  Also included is a stainless steel guide rod and spring which adds a couple extra ounces up front to reduce flip up and provides smoother cycling. This gun has <200 rounds through it which were without any problems (it's a glock, it cycles all ammo!).  This gun comes with 2 15 rounders and 3 10 rounders (for competition shoots) and a Serpa holster.  New, this gun with it's extras would be well past $700 but it's going for $550 which is a steel.

I also have plenty of ammo to get you started.  I have 250 rounds of 180gr FMJ for plinking, 24 rounds of 180gr PDX1, 22 rounds of 180gr Winchester Black Talons (not the SXTs, these are the actual black talon rounds), and a box of 50 rounds of 180gr Speer GDHPs.  

If you buy everything for a reduced total price of $1000 I'll throw in the ammo which is a $135 value.  Oh yeah, only one case for the G22 with manual, brush, etc...unless I can find the G23 case (sorry!) will come with it too.  AND...if you act quickly, I'll throw in a free magazine sleeve that slides over the G22 15 round magazine to fit more comfortably in your G23!


If you want to only buy one gun, the ammo can be sold with it for $135.

Prefer FTF transaction but if you live out of state and are willing to pay my FFL fees and shipping to you via paypal then I will work with you.

This pistol is in extremely good condition and I have spent over $755 for the pistol and accessories in this package.  I have bent considerably on my price and will consider a trade or trade/cash of similar value / condition - I am looking for any of these in outstanding condition: Hi-Point 4595 .45acp carbine, AR15 gear, KelTec PLR16, KelTec PMR30, KelTec RMR30, Ruger Mini 14.  It isn't limited to these of course so offer away.

Note - I reduced the price on this because I wanted to see who was serious about buying it.  I sat and waited 4 times for buyers that never showed - 4 times...  1 guy I actually felt sorry for because his car died on him on the interstate and he did at least call me once, unlike the other clowns.  These were the same guys who asked me to promise to wait - sorry, from now on, first come, first served.

My uncle was injured and shipped back state-side and was fortunate enough to bring the rifle back with him. After checking the serial numbers, the rifle was produced during WWII. It does have wear and tear on the stock after all these years, but considering the age and what all that gun has seen, it definitely fits. The barrel and mechanics still look and function great and all the parts are original, nothing refurbished or replaced at the armory. As long as you can shoot it will hit whatever you point it at. Along with the rifle I am including ten stripper clips, two ammo belts, an ammo sling, and the cleaning kit that goes in the stock. $800 is pretty firm as far as cash goes, but I'm interested in some possible trades to either lower the cash price or do away with it entirely, just depends on what you have. Shoot me an email and hopefully we can work something out. Thanks everyone"

For those who don’t mind a muzzle can with a little extra size and weight, the Zephyr XL is quite possibly the perfect .22lr suppressor.  While it is of nearly identical design to our regular Zephyr, it is both a little longer and a little larger in diameter, and offers even better suppression.  We purpose built the XL for rifle hosts (it looks perfectly in scale on bolt action or semi-auto .22 rifles), and .22lr machine guns, but it also makes a GREAT pistol can.  The XL is small enough in diameter to allow the user to see the sights on most pistols, but large enough to offer absolutely outstanding performance on any .22 host you choose to put it on.

 Safe Keeper® Series
 Here are perhaps the finest production push knives in almost 150 years. They have the cutting and piercing potential of a larger knife, but are small enough so that they can be easily attached to tactical web gear, tucked in a waistband or boot top, or even strapped to a wrist or ankle.

 Safe Keeper® III
 The Safe Keeper® III offers outstanding versatility, especially as a boot knife. Its light weight and overall length of five inches make it the perfect combination of small size and big performance. The single edged design of the Safe Keeper® III means you can safely ""choke up"" on the blade for extra fine work, while the false edge provides superior point strength. With only one sharp edge, the Safe Keeper® III can double as a rescue knife.
