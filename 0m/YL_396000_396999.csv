This thing is a beauty, and collectible. Blueing is perfect, literally flawless. 20 inch barrell, so a good deal more accurate than the AKM model but not as bulky as the AES-10bs that were on the market.

Im not bothering posting pictures because Im half-heartedly selling it. Im expecting the usual bombardments of lowballs and morons who cuss me out because I ask what my gun is worth.

Back when everyone thought that the pump action shotgun couldn't be improved, the Benelli Nova Pump proved otherwise. Completely original and innovative, the 12-gauge pump incorporates a polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics make the gun not only pleasing to look at, but a delight to hold and handle. Distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and forend in place of conventional checkering provides a positive gripping surface and complements the innovative engineering of the Nova Pump.

With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova 12-gauge shotgun handle anything from target loads to 3-1/2"" magnums. The Benelli Nova Pump is the most versatile pump action shotgun ever made."

I called the owner and requested that he pull one and examine the chamber. Some 7.62x39 Saigas have a stepped chamber ( http://i50.tinypic.com/2myqdyo.jpg , http://forum.saiga-12.com/uploads/monthly_05_2010/post-22REDACTED3739608_thumb.jpg ) which the Russian government requires for civilian rifles, to help identify the weapon used during a crime from the small swell it leaves in the case neck. The owner inspected one and assured me that the chamber step was not there.
The firearm arrived today and it turns out the dealer lied to me.

I am a reloader and licensed ammunition manufacturer, and while the brass can be reloaded, sizing it to such an extent reduces the number of times a piece can be reloaded. Stepped chambers do not affect the function of the rifle, and can even help in chambering cheap or surplus ammunition. This is not an issue for people who only plan to shoot cheap steel-cased ammo or those who do not reload at all.

I have not fired this rifle. I have only done a quick field strip and shone a flashlight into the chamber. It is new in the box with all accompanying parts, bags and paperwork."

When i bought it had a nice shinny SS barrel not sure on the length but since then i've needed it camo ""i mean who doesn't want a camo gun""? but my point it theres scrathes and the stock isn't in the best of shape and the holes for the scope rail mount are stripped out so i just cut the screws off in them and filed them down. Now its been like my PROJECT rifle as far as painting its been painted quite a few times and most of the time i never really cared because i just use it as my EVERYTHING all weather gun Rain or Shine, but today i really got tired of it being almost 4 different colors because everyone was making fun of it so i decided to get some good paint and sand it good and try to strip most of the old layers off and start over and personally i think it looks decent. me i'm one of those guys that don't really care about looks what counts it if it works (shoots) or not and it does. it has a factory 10 round magazine."

The Longslide version of the Glock 17. This is a newer Gen 3 in Like New Condition. I bought it on sale from my Class III Dealer. It's been in my collection a little less than a year.  Hardly shot maybe 200 rounds.  I can shoot about a .5"" group at 7-10 yards, about a 2"" group at 20 yards.

This gun is on a different level than the G19 and G17, the accuracy is unrivaled for any 9mm I've shot. 

It has extended slide catch, extended mag release, a crisp 3.5# connector/trigger, adjustable sights, 2 magazines, a beefed up extractor, a hardcase, cleaning rod, original paperwork, lock, factory fired case, and heck I'll throw in a target showing the accuracy this thing is capable of.

I am the only owner and bought this Poly at Outdoor American last year. Only shot 20 times. A steal at $450."

The new Raging Judge Magnum shoots the .454 Casull round in addition to delivering the same popular combo revolver of the original Judge models, and packs a giant 6-round cylinder. Besides added capacity, the Raging Judge features the famous red “Raging Bull” backstrap for added cushioning and will be available in both 3-inch and 6-inch barrels.

(Must have completed the basic class)

At the end of this block of instruction you will be tested on what you have learned by “surviving” for one night on streets. You will evade capture by moving and navigating to a series of check points and then on to sanctuary. During this part of the class you will be hunted, you will not know who they are but they will know who you are, you must avoid being tagged or captured. These hunters are former military, police and search and rescue, they have been through this course. They are well rested, fed and ready to go and to make it even worst for you, I have place a bounty on each and every one of you, they are only payed if they find you.  You are considered tagged if they come within 30 feet of you and captured if they get within 6 feet. Tagging you lose 5 points and you need 80 points to pass. Captured and you will start over. You have 12 hours to go 12 miles. No cars, no cell phones and no help from anyone outside of the class.

What we have here is one (1) AR-15 Pistol Lower, unused and unfired.
Upper is marked with a “key hole” which means it is forged and made by FN Manufacturing. The barrel is 7 ½” and makes for a nice short pistol.
Lower is a poly lower (and internals) made by New Frontier out of Las Vegas, making for a very light firearm. 

The hand guards are made by UTG and have the tactical rail all the way around for attaching accessories. They also have about four (4) rubber covers so you can hold it when firing.

This little pistol is a fun piece to shoot, makes for perfect home defense and/or concealed carry.....

I am currently sacrificing this awesome shooter for $899 firm, no trades, no low balls, no BG, no shipping, FTF only. Must be able to own a gun legally and be a Colorado Residence.

All numbers stamped matching, deep crisp marking(Rare Diamond 88 triangle),excellent finish, excellent bore. Has the ORIGINAL sniper trigger to this rifle which is extremely rare(second one I have seen). Scope number on side of barrel. Comes with cleaning rod.

At the end of the war the soviets had over 200,000 sniper rifles and little use for them. For reasons including expense and no need for fielding that many snipers they returned them to infantry format. Removed the scopes/mounts/bases, plugged the base holes and welded over them. They replaced the bent bolt handles with straight standard bolt handles and repaired or replaced the stock.

This one has had a very interesting history and having the original sniper trigger/sear makes it worth more than most other 91/30 ex snipers you could find or buy.

What we have here is one (1) AR-15 Pistol Lower, unused and unfired.
Upper is marked with a “key hole” which means it is forged and made by FN Manufacturing. The barrel is 7 ½” and makes for a nice short pistol.
Lower is a poly lower (and internals) made by New Frontier out of Las Vegas, making for a very light firearm. 

The hand guards are made by UTG and have the tactical rail all the way around for attaching accessories. They also have about four (4) rubber covers so you can hold it when firing.

This little pistol is a fun piece to shoot, makes for perfect home defense and/or concealed carry.....

This is Plug Fire Cartridge (PFC) replica gun that has real-like firing effect complete with muzzle flash, ejecting shell (NOT A PROJECTILE GUN) , gun powder smoke, recoil and firing sound. 

9mm P08 was specifically made for the German Army in the early 20th century and it was based on model made first for German Navy. The unofficial “Luger” name originates from salesman George Luger who played a part in designing of the gun. P08 was a standard sidearm for German troops in World War I and it continued to serve until end of World War Two. In time period between WWI and WWII Luger P08 was manufactured in non-standard 7.65mm caliber due limitations placed in Treaty of Versailles. Normally Luger P08s were manufactured in 9 x 19mm Parabellum caliber. 

Luger P08 has a unique upwards-opening, toggle-locking mechanism that gives it’s unique sleek appearance. It’s drawback was a exposure to elements that made it high-maintenance gun design.

Q&A:

Is this an firearm?
PFC model guns are in most countries legal to own and donft require license for ownership. PFC model guns cannot shoot projectiles and will only fire plug fire cartridges that create movie-like muzzle flash and firing smoke while empty shell is ejected. Depending of the gun size there maybe also recoil. No projectile of any sort is fired, so these model guns are used primarily for display, re-enactment, recreational or movie propping purposes. You can recognize our plug fire cartridge model guns from dummy model guns from operating principle explanations.

How does plug fire cartridge model guns fire?
The caps are positioned so that the internal ignition pin will ignite the cap when the PFC model gun is fired. Ready PFC cartridges are loaded in the magazine like the real thing and magazine capacity is usually identical with real counterpart. PFC model guns are cocked the same way as their real counterparts.

How realistic are model guns?
The details and functionality of model guns imitates the real counterparts very closely while still keeping things safe and fun. Best of our models are used for war museum display, living history and movie productions. Model guns are realistic reproductions that suit WWII buffs, collectors and re-enactment hobbyists a like!

It is made with leftover Soviet parts and is complete with bayonet, cleaning rod, and 91/30 sling.  The Polish-made carbines are known for their excellent fit and finish as well as their scarcity compared to other M44 variants.  

It is not a refurb so the metal and wood show honest wear, but no damage.  The bore has very strong rifling and very light pitting (very common as these shoot corrosive military ammunition).  

The bolt does not match, but everything else does.  It is a good shooter but the front sight may need to be adjusted as its hash marks and peening does not mate (it may just be a replacement from another rifle).  

Please email or call me at REDACTED to set up a time to inspect the rifle or make an offer on it.

*** NEW SAFIR ARMS T14 AR15 .410GA SHOTGUN UPPER RECEIVER ***
===============================================

Video review: http://youtu.be/A9mpThuj-WQ
Shooting demonstration: http://youtu.be/xwCMZeQIVyo

SUMMARY:
This Ad is for a Brand New/Never Been Fired Safir Arms T14 AR-15 Upper receiver with accessories. Safir Arms' previous uppers featured carbine and rifle-length plastic M16 style hand guards whereas this one uses a complete aluminum QUAD-RAIL!

FITS ON ANY MILSPEC AR-15 LOWER
This is a complete AR-15 upper receiver chambered .410ga 2.5"" shot shell, and can be used with any standard milspec lower to turn your AR15 into a semi-automatic shotgun! 

AD IS FOR UPPER RECEIVER ONLY
This item is the UPPER RECEIVER ONLY, not a complete firearm, but all you need to do is attach this upper to your existing AR-15 lower. There are a number of good quality upper receivers for less than $300 available, some examples include Stag Arms, Palmetto State Armory, giving you a complete semi-automatic shotgun for around the same cost as a standard AR-15 chambered in .223. 

I DO NOT have AR-15 lowers, nor could I sell you one as I'm not an FFL, however, I can refer you to my FFL to purchase one from him.

DOES NOT REQUIRE AN FFL AND CAN SHIP DIRECTLY TO YOUR DOOR
AR-15 uppers are NOT considered firearms by the BATFE, therefore DO NOT need to be transferred through an FFL and can ship directly to your door!

COMPATIBLE AMMUNITION
Safir Arms is a Turkish Manufacturer with a state-side office in New Jersey. This upper was originally designed for European 36caliber shot shell (basically, .410ga). This upper will accept the following 2.5"" .410ga shot shells:

1. Estate Sport/Competition .410, Cartridge 2-1/2"" #7.5 Lead 1/2 Ounce 1200 fps 25 Round Box Manufacturer: FEDERAL Estate Cartridge Mfr Part #:ESS41075
2. FEDERAL Estate Cartridge # 8 and 9 Mfr Part #:ESS4108 and Mfr Part #: ESS4109
3. Federal Ammo 410ga 25 5oz Hi-Brass 6 25rds/bx Mfr Part #:FEDH4126
4. WINCHESTER RIFLED SLUG 410 Gauge, 2 1/2', 1/5 oz, 1830 fps, 5 Rd/bx X41RS5*
5. Remington Shotshell 20750 9 410ga 2-1/2 1/2oz Mfr Part #:REMSTS4109*
6. Remington Long Range Field and Express 1/5 oz Slugs. #4, Mfr. Part: REMSP4104 #6 Mfr. Part: REMSP4106 Long Range, #6 Mfr. Part:REMSP41075
7. FEDERAL Premium Personal Defense #4 Shot (not to be confused with with Personal Defense 000 buckshot)*

*Rounds I've personally tested in my own T14, Winchester Super X Rifled Slugs (X41RS5) worked best for me

The Pro Covert II™ .45 ACP from the Kimber Custom

30 lines-per-inch checkering with bordered base on
the front strap. While it has a full size frame, a 4-inch
barrel makes it easier to conceal—and rounded
edges on both slide and frame ensure it will not
hang up on clothing or holsters. Crimson Trace
Lasergrips with digital camoufl age pattern and
Tactical Wedge three dot (green) Meprolight® night
sights combine to ensure a positive aiming point
even in extreme low light. Lasergrips are a $369
value when purchased separately, and are powered
by two #2032 lithium batteries with over 4 hours
run time. Standard Kimber features include match
grade barrel, chamber and trigger for unequaled
accuracy, and beveled magazine well for quick
and positive loading. The Pro Covert II is a great
compromise of size and weight, but like all Kimber®
pistols, the one thing it will never compromise is
performance.
Covert pistols feature Crimson
Trace Lasergrips in digital
camouflage with the Kimber
logo. Lasergrips promote faster
shooting and are tremendous
training aids.

Battlegrip Model BGV-QDK

After years of searching for the ultimate Quick Detach method for our vertical grips, TangoDown has teamed with American Defense to bring you the best vertical grip yet.

Some weapon systems and mission profiles require a quick detach/attach method for vertical grips and other components. Ideally, this design would require a wide range of adjustment to fit MIL-STD spec and out-of-spec rails. It would also require no tools for rapid, accurate adjustment in the harshest field conditions. It would also be bombproof and light as possible.

That grip is now available. The BGV-QD series vertical grip.. the latest evolution of our combat-tested and proven BGV-series of vertical grips.

The BGV-QD series features an ADM U.S. Patent Pending throw lever system that is steps above anything else available to operators. First, the throw lever locks in place when installed, and cannot be inadvertently unlocked, if caught on web gear, slings, etc. A simple push button releases the throw lever from the locked position allowing lightning fast attachment or removal when you decide.

Next, the adjustment system for fitting ANY type of rail, from authentic MIL-STD 1913 to commercial Weaver type is KISS compliant. Adjustment is accomplished in a flash, with no tools. It is simple, elegant, light and strong. No more fumbling for wrenches that may–or- may not be in your kit while you’re on a mountain top in Afghanistan. All hardware is TYPE III hard coat anodized, or given an anti-glare black Melonite coating for superior corrosion protection.

The BGV-QD series grips still feature the best heat and impact modified polymers that money can buy. Our proprietary formulated resins take combat abuse in stride, and complete the mission every time without fracturing or shattering from impact, common with some other brands. All BGV series grips are injection molded from fiberglass-reinforced resin, not machined from un-reinforced brittle delrin, for the utmost in strength. Our grips are designed for use on M4s all the way to 7.62mm belt fed SAWs, and routinely pass 6’ drop tests on these weapon systems. The BGV-MK46 vertical grip is one of only two vertical grips in the US Military inventory, awarded NSN # 1010-01-536-4707.

BGV-QD series grips also retain our O- ring protected internal storage cavity, good for depths of 66 feet. This cavity allows for easy access storage of weapon spares, batteries and other combat essential items. 

The BGV-QDK grip is the optimum choice for breaching shotguns, M4s, CQB systems such as the MK18..any system requiring a compact envelope. The shorter length also lends itself to vehicle use, or tight operating environments. The BGV-QDK is available in black, flat dark earth and foliage green.

As always, every Tangodown product is proudly designed, tooled and produced here in the United States of America. Our mission still remains to provide the finest possible kit to the U.S. Warfighter.

Shoots well. I am more into 1911 .45 's reason for selling. From Smith: ""The Smith & Wesson 459 was the 2nd generation of the Smith & Wesson 59 (which was a double stacked magazine version of the Smith & Wesson 39). The only real difference between the 459 and the Smith & Wesson 59 was adjustable rear sights (and a slight modification to the front sight to accommodate the higher profile of the newer rear sights). Early production models had the round trigger guard. Later models had the square triggerguard. It was only in production for 8 years""   This is the later produced model."

The manufacturing date of the complete lower is 4/30/2010.  All POF lower receivers are machined from 7075 aluminum, and are MilSpec type III hard coat anodized.  They have a flaired magwell for speed loads.

The manufacturing date of the SIG US516-16 upper is 4/13/2011.  SIG SAUER® advanced short-stroke pushrod system. This advanced operating system reduces carbon fouling, excessive heat and unburned powder in the action, ensuring reliability and function that is unmatched.

Features a free-floating, aluminum, M1913 quad rail and 1:7 right-hand twist bore configuration.

An adjustable gas valve allows operators to increase the flow of gas when using lower pressure ammunition or when adverse conditions require additional energy. Reduced flow and the off-position enhance the use of suppressors.

With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova 12-gauge shotgun handle anything from target loads to 3-1/2"" magnums. The Benelli Nova Pump is the most versatile pump action shotgun ever made.

Benelli Marketing Statement:
Back when everyone thought that the pump action shotgun couldn't be improved, the Benelli Nova Pump proved otherwise. Completely original and innovative, the 12-gauge pump incorporates a polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics make the gun not only pleasing to look at, but a delight to hold and handle. Distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and forend in place of conventional checkering provides a positive gripping surface and complements the innovative engineering of the Nova Pump."

I really want another pocket gun, prefer a larger caliber such as the 9mm or bigger. Must be small enough to fit in the pocket. 

The Kahr CM9 is a super hot seller, superlight weight, small size, big bore, and thin grip (less .90 overall).  makes this one of the best selling summer pocket guns. I love it, but it doesn't fit my big meaty hands very well.
