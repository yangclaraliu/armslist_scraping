Comes with 10 round box magazine, a high capacity 30 round removable SKS mag, cleaning kit in buttstock, cleaning rod, and original spike bayonet is still on the rifle! (Many you see for sale these days are missing the bayonet). All original finishes on wood (very nice stock for a Norinco) & metal w/ just a few handling marks here or there- bore is mirror bright w/ extremely strong rifiling; very nice example of this highly desirable /26\ made paratrooper. Looking for $375 cash or will consider trades or partial trades plus cash. Price has been lowered because this is not a numbers matching rifle like I originally thought it was. After further inspection, the bolt & box magazine are numbered differently....All else does appear to match and be original though, but does have an aftermarket extended mag catch installed. I have fired a few rounds thru it & It is a great shooter & performs flawlessly, so someone is going to get a great deal! Pic shows w/ detachable mag, but I currently have it set-up with the original standard 10-round box mag."

The CZ 82 features a double stack magazine and a polygonal barrel.  This gun fire very nicely and comes with 2-12 round magazines.

The P83 features and de-cocking lever and 2 single stack, 8 round magazines, 

This package will include: a black holster that will fit either weapon, 1 magazine holder (meant for the CZ82), 200 rounds of boxer primed ammunition, 200 rounds of empty reloadable cartridges, Lee reloading dies and the cleaning rod that came with the CZ.

My research show that both weapons are selling in the $260.00 to $280.00 with 2 magazines.  The loaded rounds retail at $19.99 per box of 50, and the dies sell for about $28.00, so not including holster and mag pouch, I am into what is there over $625.00 (at the 260 each price on the guns).  Plus I paid tax (on the ammo) , and shipping, and FFL fee (on the weapons)....

It would take AT LEAST $680 to duplicate this package, possibly much more, and you may not get as nice a product.

Raven Concealment Phantom Holister w/ Single Modular Pistol Mag Carrier (set up for a right handed person):  
The Phantom was designed from the outset to provide the highest possible level of concealment by being adaptable to wear with virtually any style of clothing.  What makes the Phantom so unique is its ultra-thin, body-hugging pancake profile.  This profile, in conjunction with our Eclipse Modular Mounting System, allows the Phantom to be worn either on the belt or inside the waistband.  The pistol mag carries one pistol magazine. Mag carriers come standard with 1.5"" belt loops. Mag carriers are compatible with any Eclipse accessory.  If you are going to conceal carry this holster ROCKS! There is normally a 2 month wait for this type of holster (it took four months for me to get it last year)."

History:
My Grandfather a 1/2 Cherokee from Muskogee OK bought this gun off reservation and used it personally, moving to McAllen TX.  It was then given to my father when he flew in WWII off the carrier Essex and as he was becoming an Ace and Double Navy Cross holder(mementos in Pensacola Naval Air Museum) and in 1987 had the Corpus Christi, TX Navy Airfield named after him.  No kids to hand it down to so here it is for sale.

Included in the sale is a hand tooled holster at least dated in the 40's-50's, copy of my Grandfathers deed to Cherokee Nation Land, My Fathers documented Naval exploits, some original pictures of the 2 owners."

They retail at around $320 new. I have this scope mounted on my 700 VTR, and I couldn't be happier with it. Right now, it is shooting .5 inch groups at 150 yards using a 168grn Sierra Match Grade BTHP in .308.

I have barely used it, just for sighting in. I really like the scope, but I want to upgrade to a target style scope with fine adjustment knobs in the 1/8 range. I have done a lot of other upgrades to this rifle and need to get into the 800 yard range. That is my only reason for selling the scope.

This would make a perfect scope for anyone that wants to shoot their rifle up to 500 yards with the built in bullet drop compensator, or just wants to hunt deer, bear, pigs whatever accurately. Shots in the 150 yard range group less than .5 inches, so accuracy is not an issue. The rifle was stock when I shot these groups.

From the BlueBook: DALY, CHARLES: JAPANESE MFG. : SHOTGUNS: O/U

In the early sixties, C. Daly guns were manufactured by the firm of B.C. Miroku in Kochi, Japan. This Japanese gun manufacturing company has produced guns for many companies, Browning being the biggest current customer. Miroku guns are high quality with excellent fit and finish. Many of them are highly engraved and are fine examples of the gunmaker's art. Charles Daly Miroku Guns are becoming quite collectible in some areas. Their production ceased in 1976.

It's a .40 and takes all full size Glock .40 magazines.  Paid off the rifle last week and shot 50 rounds through it the first day. Shot great, light recoil, and very accurate. The gun is very light at right around 4lbs unloaded, and folds completely in half to measure about 16x7 inches.  Fits perfectly inside a laptop or other small, easily concealed bags. Great for use as a truck gun, easily folded out to full size and ready to go in just seconds. I would love to keep the gun, but i'm in the middle of an AR15 build and I need the cash at the moment. These guns are in high demand and very short supply. The .40 Glock version of the Sub2000 is especially hard to find. Check Gunbroker.com and Gunsamerica.com, this gun is going for well over 475 and are not common at all. I'm not trying to make a bunch of money, just trying to cover the cost of my build.  This gun is perfect for the beginner into firearms who are wanting a low cost fun gun/home defense weapon!

This post is for a highly customized gen 3 Glock 35 .40 cal practical tactical that is better than new in the hard box with other extras.  It has a lot of upgrades.  These include a Ghost 3.5# trigger connector,  Jager steel recoil guide rod, Jager reduced power recoil spring(for reliably cycling decreased power/sub-sonic ammo), extended magazine release, Wolff competition spring kit, maritime spring cups and polished internals.  It also comes with all original stock parts as well.  It is durcoated in ""urban rattler camo"" and does come with the almost new match grade Storm Lake 9mm conversion barrel shown,  (6 mags)three high-cap .40 cal mags and one 10 rd, two 9mm mags(one is an aftermarket 32rd 9mm mag with +2 extension(Not shown) and a black and tan right handed suede leather holster, as well as a slick black leather slider holster.  The round count is fairly low at around 700 rds. between the two barrels, with the majority fired through the stock .40 barrel. The frame also has a new set of Rock Solid Outfitters gator grips installed. (Not the wrap around shown) Neither sweat, mud, crap nor blood will cause this pistol to slip with these grips installed.
I am asking $700 obo cash for the entire package deal FTF in/around Knoxville and the only trade I know I would be interested in at this time is a good condition Keltec PF-9 or maybe a P-32.  I would give somewhere between $200-300 trade, depending on pistol, condition and accessories but would need the rest in cash.
I live inside the city limits but if you have a place to shoot, I will happily let you test fire a few rounds of your ammo so you can see/feel the difference between this Glock and a stock Glock. 
This is how definitely one way to rock a Glock !
Please check out the pics and let me know if you have any questions or need a specific picture or have any questions.  I plan to add some new pics soon.  The ones shown now were mostly taken to show the Burris Fastfire II that has already been sold and is not included with this pistol.
Thanks and let me know if you would like to check it out.

[b]Item Description:[/b] I am selling an excellent example of a Mauser C-96. This one was manufactured in 1914. The finish is in great shape and has not been reblued. 

History
The Mauser C96 (Construktion 96)[3] is a semi-automatic pistol that was originally produced by German arms manufacturer Mauser from 1896 to 1937.[4] Unlicensed copies of the gun were also manufactured in Spain and China in the first half of the 20th century.[4][5]

The distinctive characteristics of the C96 are the integral box magazine in front of the trigger, the long barrel, the wooden shoulder stock which can double as a holster or carrying case and a grip shaped like the handle of a broom. The grip earned the gun the nickname ""Broomhandle"" in the English-speaking world and in China the C96 was nicknamed the ""box cannon"" (Chinese: ???; pinyin: hézipào) because of its square-shaped internal magazine and the fact it could be holstered in its wooden box-like detachable stock.[6] It was used by the Latvian anarchist Peter Piaktow in 1911 and was therefore known as a 'Peter the Painter' gun by the IRA.[7]

The Mauser C96, with its shoulder stock, long barrel and high-velocity cartridge had superior range and better penetration than most other pistols; the 7.63×25mm Mauser cartridge was the highest velocity commercially manufactured pistol cartridge until the advent of the .357 Magnum cartridge in 1935.[8]

Approximately 1 million C96 pistols were manufactured by Mauser,[9] with the number produced in Spain and China being large but unknown due to the loss, non-existence or poor upkeep of production records from those countries.

Within a year of its introduction, the C96 had been sold to governments and commercially for resale to civilians and individual military officers.

The Mauser C96 pistol was also extremely popular with British officers at the time and purchased privately by many of them; numbers were supplied to Westley Richards in the UK for this purpose, although its popularity with the British military had waned by the onset of World War I.[10]

As a military sidearm, the pistols saw service in various colonial wars, as well as World War I, The Estonian War of Independence, the Spanish Civil War, the Chinese Civil War and World War II. The C96 also became a staple of Bolshevik Commissars and various warlords and gang leaders in the Russian Civil War.

Indian Revolutionary Ram Prasad Bismil and his partymen used these Mauser Pistols in the historical Kakori train robbery on 9 August 1925. His lieutenant Ashfaqullah Khan gave his Mauser to Manmath Nath Gupta and engaged himself to break open the cash chest. Incidentally, Manmath Nath Gupta tried to fire the newly seen weapon and a passenger was killed in the action.

Winston Churchill was fond of the Mauser C96 and used one at the Battle of Omdurman and during the Second Boer War; similarly, Lawrence of Arabia carried a Mauser C96 for a period during his time in the Middle East.[4][11] Chinese Communist general Zhu De carried a Mauser C96 during his Nanchang Uprising and later conflicts; his gun (with his name printed on it) can be viewed in the Beijing war museum.

Imported and domestic copies of the C96 were used extensively by the Chinese in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, as well as by the Spanish during the Spanish Civil War and the Germans in World War II.[5][12]

Besides the standard 7.63×25mm chambering, C96 pistols were also commonly chambered for 9×19mm Parabellum with a small number also being produced in 9 mm Mauser Export. There was also a Chinese-manufactured model chambered for .45 ACP.[4] Despite the pistol's worldwide popularity and fame, the only nation to use the C96 as the primary service pistol of its military and police was China. The Broomhandle Mauser has become a popular collector's gun.[4]

The C96 frequently appears as a ""foreign"" or ""exotic"" pistol in a number of films and TV shows, owing to its distinctive and instantly recognisable shape,[4] and for the same reasons and in the same tradition, a C96 was modified to form Han Solo's prop blaster pistol for the Star Wars film

Caliber .30 carbine

Comes with:

An inland m1 carbine, blank adapter, 2 magazines, sling, ruger carrying case, and an original WW2 USMC ammo pouch.

This one is in pretty good shape. I bought this from a reenactor, so it has a threaded barrel and blank adapter. This is perfect for a collector or reenactor. 

It has a few post-war/Late war parts though, adjustable sight, flip safety switch, round bolt as opposed to a flat bolt and the guy sawed the bayonet lug off of the gun...scratching the barrel. There is a very small, scratch in the metal. But nothing that will harm the weapons functioning. I can provide pictures on request.

Caliber is 7.62x51 (.308)
This is the 14.5"" barrel with the permanently attached muzzle break to take it beyond the 16"" legal threshold.  To be clear: this is NOT a short barrel rifle per the NFA.
This sweet shooting rifle has had about 400 rounds through it.
I have also attached iron sights by Troy industries which are fantastic.  The front sight is the HK hooded style with a tritium dot for aiming.  The rear sight is the diamond pattern and fully adjustable.
The pic is from POF-USA.  It is a good representation.  The only difference is that the pic has the 'hunter' rail and my rifle has the full tactical rail.
I'll be loading pics of the actual rifle within a few days.

1. Remington 870 Tactical Magnum- 

This amazing shotgun was a limited run for the 2005 Shot Show. They are pretty difficult to find, especially at a fair price. It comes from the factory duracoated in OD green. The magazine tube capacity is 7+1 which is also a factory modification. This shotgun also has the pistol grip. There are a few light knicks and dings but nothing serious. The OD is actual OD green. I know it is difficult to see in the photos, but I assure you, it is OD green. I am asking $525 or best offer. 


2. Remington 870 Wingmaster- 

This 870 has been heavily upgraded and is in great condition. The finish has a bright color and really looks great with the stainless accents. The stock is a tapco intrafuse, molded pistol grip, a railed pump for mounting lights, etc.. It also comes with a forward grip mounted to the pump. When I purchased this shotgun, I changed the barrel to a mossberg brand 18.5 inch door breacher barrel. It also has a side shell holder. The magazine capacity is 4+1, so 8 shells are ready for your disposal. I am asking $400 or best offer.

3. Remington 870- 

This gun has been upgraded with a choate stock which also includes a 5 shell holder incorporated into the stock. The barrel is 18.5 inches long and is also a mossberg door breacher barrel which is a direct replacement for 870's. This gun is in good condition. I am asking $375 or best offer. 

I went on a tactical shotgun kick for quite a while but it is now time for me to move on. I will consider negotiating with a cash buyer that wants to purchase all three. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me. I am interested in some trades but cash is king, so the trade must be worth my while."

This is not a police trade in that you might find more frequently.  This is a commercial imported P7 that was brought into Arlington back in the early 80s.  This is a collector piece, but it also happens to be the best shooting P7 out of 6 different P7s that I have shot.

Without a doubt, this weapon will outshoot any other weapon its size and it is capable of out-grouping your 1911.  In spite of that accuracy, this is the fastest weapon made to draw, cock, and fire.  It's also the only handgun that I've ever felt comfortable in carrying with one in the chamber.

I could ramble on for a few hours about the accolades of the P7, and this is one of the most desirable of the P7 PSP.

Notice that this one has the wide and flush magazine release.  The earlier Arlington imports had a protruding mag release which is not as desirable as the later flush mag release.  The early Arlingtons with the protruding mag release have had some cracking issues with the welds in the slide.  The later P7M8 models have issues with cosmetics and also with broken firing pin bushings...it's what happens when you try to re-engineer a masterpiece.

This Arlington P7 PSP is the sweet spot of all the years this gun was made....absolutely the best of the best.

Yes, this weapon has been carried and it has been shot.  But it is in perfect working order and you won't believe what it can do.

Please note, that this deal is for the P7 and magazine only....other toys pictured are not included :)

Thanks for looking."
