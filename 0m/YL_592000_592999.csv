I bought this rifle new in the 1960's and am the only owner it has had.
It was built by Browning in Belgium using the medium Sako action, an extremely smooth operating bolt action. I grade the condition as a strong 95%, closer to 98% on the blueing. I have always babied it and kept it cleaned and lubed.
The current Gun Digest Book of Guns and Prices shows the value at $1350.00 in excellent condition, and $1100.00 in very good condition. This rifle will grade out at better than very good.
The prices shown in the Fjestad Blue book of Gun Values are similar.  
The price is for the bare rifle, without the scope and sling, but does include the Redfield one piece mount. 
The rifle is not for everyone, but is a genuine buy for a collector who also wants a practical shooting and hunting rifle.
I prefer a face to face sale in New Mexico, but can arrange out of state shipping to your Federal Firearms Licensee. Buyer covers shipping cost."

Remington 700... The origin of the Marine Corps M40A1 Sniper rifle.
SPECIAL NOTE; when creating this post for caliber there was no just .223 caliber option.  Just incase you didnt know, do not shoot 5.56 thru this.

I'll throw in a USMC range pamphlet if ya want it.  It entails all sorts of shooting advice.  It's a M16A4 range book,but same shooting principals apply.  Ie. Recognizing wind calls and making adjustments,  bone support and muscle relaxation, etc.

Will reply with pictures in first e mail
Comes with Remington scope, adjustable bi pods, rifle case and a stock sock which can hold (10) .223 rounds.

After testing and reviews the USMC placed the initial order for 700 Remington 700/M40 sniper rifles in 1966. 550 of those had the redfield 3-9x accurange scope mounted. As time progressed, the weaknesses of the factory M700/40x rifles began to show. The all wood stocks were very prone to shifting in changes in the weather and other ""

-additional comment added- i have had several inquiries on this, some have asked if i would consider trades and i cannot because i need the money to pay off debt. also, i have had some ask if i would take less and i will not. $950 is firm, i have searched several online gunsites and have not found a colt ar-15 for less. i found 1 for $975 (sold), but most were $1100 and up. colt is the name in ar-15s, they are mil spec with the best parts, trigger assembly, barrel etc. which makes colt superior in performance and reliabiltiy. colt sets the standard  which all other ar-15 makers copy.  google colt sporter lightweight for sale and see if you can find one for less, then add shipping and ffl fees to it ($55-$65) if out of state. call or text jeff nine18-nine02-2583. no email due to scammers. thx."

The StG 44 is one of those guns in history that is in a class by itself. By most accounts, it was the first modern “assault rifle,” and would have made a big difference in WWII had it arrived sooner in the war. but it didn’t, and the StG 44, otherwise known as the MP43 or MP44, has taken its place in history as part of the failed Nazi war effort that was defeated handily by the Allies.

American Tactical Imports (ATI), is bringing in a replica of this famous rifle in .22LR rimfire this year, and we got to take a look at one for Media Day at the Range, SHOT Show 2012. It is made in Germany by GSG, and ATI has already imported several other rimfire guns from this company over the past several years. The StG 44 is a full weight, almost exact replica of the original 8×33 Kurz rifle that is said to be the predecessor to the Kalashnikov, as well as all of the other assault rifles spanning the decades after WWII.
 it will come in the wooden crate you see here in the pictures. We were able to try the initial prototypes at the range and they seemed to work great. Hopefully ATI will send us a gun or two to test once they are ready to sell them. As a collector’s item, the original StG 44 is out of the reach of most American collectors, in part because the original was select fire and therefore banned from import by the 1986 machinegun law. In semi-auto .22LR rimfire, not only can you own a gun with the original look and feel of the real StG 44, you will be able to shoot it cheaply, and it will itself be a big collector’s item as we go down the road. This was one of the guns everyone was talking about at SHOT this year, and if you can get one ordered, you might want to get in line now because supply will not keep up with demand for a long time after they start coming into the country."

-Beamshot GreenBeam 2000 Daylight Laser Sight is the most innovative of the laser sights available today. This is the first of the laser gun sights manufactured with a green laser beam - this color is one of the most sensitive to the human eyes. The 532nm green laser diode, along with exceptional glass optics, produces a 1 mile nighttime range and is even visible in broad daylight. Similar to the Beam Shot GreenBeam 1000 Daylight Laser Sight, the Green Beam 2000's laser is 20 times brighter than red laser sights and produces a target dot smaller than 2"" at 100 yards for precise accuracy. It is also easily adjusted, with windage and elevation adjustment screws that are slotted for adjustment with a coin or a screwdriver. The Beamshot GreenBeam True Daylight Lasersight 2000 delivers unmatched target acquisition anytime, all the time."

Review from Christiangunowner.com from Mark C.:

""The Smith and Wesson 3913 is, in my opinion, one of the best options for concealed carry. My variation is the 3913NL. The NL is the same as the LadySmith, but without the Ladysmith logo. The slide is less than 1 inch in thickness, the grips are slightly larger. It weighs in at 24 ounces, about the same as a GLOCK 19. The slide is thinner than the cylinder of my Ruger SP101, and hence is more comfortable to carry IWB. It is flat and is barely noticeable when carrying it. I carry this gun everyday and sometimes forget it is there. 

The Smith and Wesson 3913 is a 9mm with a capacity of 8+1. One thing to be aware of is that +P ammo is not suggested for extended use, due to excessive frame wear. However, limited use of +P is ok. I carry Speer Gold Dots +P in mine.

This is a double action pistol, while some prefer the constant pull of striker fired guns, I prefer the heavy first shot and lighter follow ups. The 3913 is surprisingly accurate for a gun with a 3 1/2 inch barrel. In my hands follow up shots are quick and easy. I easily keep all my shots in 1 1/2 to 2 inch groups at 25 feet. Which is what I practice most for self defense.

The manual and magazine safeties were also a consideration for me. When storing the gun for the night I put the manual safety on, but carry with it off. I have heard a lot of opinions on magazine safeties and understand both sides of the argument. Some prefer not to have it due to tactical reloads and being able to fire the gun with one in the chamber and magazine removed. That may be good for cops/military, but for everyday CCW I don't see the point. I prefer the magazine disconnect. If you got into a fight and someone was trying to get your gun then all you have to do is drop the magazine and render the gun un-fireable. There are reports where this capability has saved officers' lives. I also use this function when I want to keep the gun ready but am worried about someone finding it. With the mag removed and separate from the gun then there are no worries.

Unfortunately, Smith & Wesson discontinued this model several years ago, along with other 3rd generation models in favor of the M&P. Some are still available through LE contracts.""

This pistol is at least 85%, looks close to new, with one flat-base magazine and one curved base magazine, both original S&W factory magazines.  It is the NL-style, without the ""LadySmith"" etching on the frame.  I prefer to sell locally, F2F to an 18+ year old legally qualified buyer.  If no interest locally, I will ship to an FFL for actual shipping costs, which could reach $50.  Please contact me by email if interested, or for more detailed pics and/or questions you need answered."

The grips are thinner as well The front strap has finger grooves built in. The Commander size slide and barrel ( 4.25"" ) , combined with the officers size grip makes this the ideal conceled carry pistol. The bobbed grip safety makes a lot smaller "" print "" under a shirt or jacket.  It has a Colt licensed Series 80 firing pin disconnect in the slide. Stainless Steel construction. Complete with box, lock and Para paperwork.. An awesome pistol, and a joy to shoot.

The Essex frames were used because of their superior steel qualities ( over frames that were made in the 1940s ) , and the fact that the finished pistols could follow the Soldier to his next duty station, because the pistol belonged to him, rather than the US Government.The Pistol has a Colt military slide, a Colt National Match Barrel throated for semi wadcutters as well as round nose ammo , Colt National Match bushing, Adjustable trigger, National Match front sight, Fully adjustable rear sight.

(5) circle 21 bulgarian 30 rd magazines. The mags alone sell for more than 40$ a piece. I also have 5 sealed tins of over 1,000 rds in each tin with tin opener still in the russian crates.

I prefer to do this whole thing as a package.
 Here's everyone priced out for what I want for it. Again, this is not a US barrel. It is CHROME LINED BULGARIAN. This is the best barrel you can get on this rifle and it's a NODAK SPUD receiver. All original matching bulgarian parts. This isn't your average 600$ AK.

Total $2,000.00 for a bad ass rifle and nearly a lifetime supply of pure bullet goodness.

The only things I would take into consideration would be a PSL, glocks only in 9mm, and an ak47 draco pistol, or some sort of shortened ak47 with a chrome lined barrel and underfolder.

I have had a cash offer the way it sits for $900 so I would like to get a better trade deal than that 
I will only consider trades for multiple guns unless its a higher end 1911 as the past few years have been a struggle financially for me and I have literally sold all of my guns to keep my family afloat 
Send me an email and I will send pics 
I'm not a hunter I have guns for the fun of shooting and because I'm kind of a prepper so bird shotguns ect don't really trip my fancy, I have always been a few of a few all around defense/offense/hunting(in a pinch) type weapons

- They do not make these anymore...VERY RARE. Blueing and stock is 100 percent condition. This gun has had maybe a box of shells through it. Gun has sat in safe for years untouched! Here are a few links on where I got my pricing from...

First of all, the age for legal private party handgun sales in WI is, in fact, 18 (as long as they are a legal WI resident, non-felon, etc.). You can verify this with your local police department if you are unsure.

Second, requiring a CCW permit for purchase of a handgun is obviously a personal preference, but it will limit your sales. Not everybody that can legally own a handgun has their CCW. If it's a matter of personal security, a signed bill of sale with the buyer's DL number would be more than enough to cover you."

For sale is a LNIB special production Para Ordnance SF-45 14-45 double-stack 1911 with a desert tan / coyote brown finish and Trijicon night sights - all straight from the manufacturer.  This model has a 5"" match grade barrel with a fully-supported ramp, a light rail, and a match grade trigger with ~4.5 lb pull and very short reset.  

Only ~250 of these firearms were produced without any additional markings.  Most of these models with the tan ion-bond finish have specific custom logos on them.  This model is completely clean of those custom markings, and appears as shown in the pictures on this page.

Also included are two 14-round magazines, both manufactured by Para.

These Para firearms are being considered by the FBI as their standard issue, and is currently being carried by many law enforcement officers across the nation.  It is the perfect self-defense and on-duty carry .45 ACP with a standard 14-round magazine, Trijicon night sights, match grade barrel, an integrated light rail, and a tactical desert tan dura-coat finish.  Seriously, the perfect firearm.

Please respond with any questions, and I'll do my best to answer them.  I carry this weapon on-duty, and am very proficient with its mechanics and performance; therefore, can probably answer any questions you may have.
