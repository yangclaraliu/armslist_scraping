I've babied this rifle for years, has clean sharp rifling, good wood, and is sub -MOA with even Russian ammo. It's taken my first deer, coyote, bobcat, and with Barnes ammo, it can take deer, hogs, coyotes etc. at decent range. It's been my go to rifle for hunting on foot, and doubles as a bet winner on the farm! It's no problem to hit consistently with this lil guy inside of 400 yds (never used it further). It's the first bolt gun I ever owned, and it would do well as a truck/varmint/predator/deer/hog gun for a small kid, or even a fun gun for an adult. I'm 5,10"", 200 lbs, and it's a dream to lug into the deer woods!

I've babied this rifle for years, has clean sharp rifling, good wood, and is sub -MOA with even Russian ammo. It's taken my first deer, coyote, bobcat, and with Barnes ammo, it can take deer, hogs, coyotes etc. at decent range. It's been my go to rifle for hunting on foot, and doubles as a bet winner on the farm! It's no problem to hit consistently with this lil guy inside of 400 yds (never used it further). It's the first bolt gun I ever owned, and it would do well as a truck/varmint/predator/deer/hog gun for a small kid, or even a fun gun for an adult.

Includes Rem Scope, sling, hard case and a stock sock for rounds.  The benefit of the rifle being chambered in .223 is all in the ballastics; lighter weight vise the .308 translates into lesser variation of the bullet flight path. the .223's flat trajectory from 30-550 will key whole everytime on a stable firing platform.  Ok so will the .308, but after 550, the heft of the .308 affects trajectory drastically.  Not the case with the lighter, flatter shooting .223.  Imagine shooting a light weight arrow 25yds then again shooting a bigger bow with a heavier arrow... the .223 is a nail driver. I will E mail pics in firsty reply."

I have a few things I can trade including a Asus Netbook with SSD hard drive. Maytag Washer and Dryer (the dryer needs a belt, works but squeaks), brush guard for 92 Full Size Blazer, I have a military light kit, they are wired flourescent lights with a hard plastic cover, they could be used in a shop or something. But the light kit had a hard plastic case with a padded inside, without the lights it would be perfect for a gun case. I have a couple military issued Meyerco switchblade knifes. I have a truck box with two either 8 inch or 10 inch Sony subwoofers. I also have 3 35 inch tires that fit 20 inch rims. 

If you would like pics just let me know, everything but the laptop is in storage. Thanks

Edit: I have received a few emails on the switchblades, I went to my storage and cannot find them to save my life. I will be moving into my house soon so I will be able to sift through it a little better. If you are interested in them just send me an email and when I find them I will let you know asap. Other than the switch blades, I have all of it and I took pics while I was there if you are interested. Thanks for your understanding. I have also taken a few more things out of storage and will add to the list.

The trigger on this gun is really nice. Gun has a nice Hogue molded wrap around grip with stainless grip screws. I also swapped out the front sight for a Hiviz fiber optic sight.

No import marks, no matching parts, bore is fair but will clean up better, very good finish, functions great. Comes with one SA marked original magazine.

Purchased this a while back, original stock was ruined. I ordered a reproduction stock which is a perfect copy of the original stock/handguard, it fits well but the handguard needs to be sanded/fitted better.
The scope rail has 2 holes on either side for an aftermarket scope mount. These are cosmetic only and do not harm the function of the rifle. I never noticed them and if they bother you, put a SVT scope on the rifle and you wont see them.

Gun is ready to go, functions great. I just need to thin the herd.

$800 or make me an offer.
Finn captures are hard to find and cost around $1000 if you can find them.

I picked it up used at a gun show. Now I need to sell it for car parts money, picked up a new beater and it needs some work. It does show some wear here and there and has a few scratches, especially on the handguard from the sling swivel. Not sure on the round count, but the rifling looks very good. The rifle is completely functional except for the safety. It needs to either have a selector from a standard AK or have the current selector built back up. The selector swap is very simple and a selector can be picked up for $20 shipped from apex gun parts. If you can take down an ak to clean the barrel, you can change the selector out. 

The parts used in the conversion are a Dinzag Arms trigger guard, Hogue grip, tapco G2 trigger group modified with spacer to fit the Saiga .308, and an ATI butt stock. I retained the factory bolt hold open. If you don't like the buttstock, I have a standard Tapco adjustable I can toss on there. The butt stock's cheekrest pad/sticker has a scratch on it and is less than $10 to replace.  Here's a link to one.

  From what I have made out , It is an Egyptian mauser marked 1909 with a Flaming circle and Egyptian hyroglithics. This type of rifle is valued at around $ 1,800 U.S. dollars on the internet but theres a problem. There is a sliding sand/dust cover that protects the breach on this rifle .  My internet search cannot find anything about this model of rifle that has a sand/dust cover at the breach , it does look like a mauser m - 1895. Could it be that this rifle is rare?

If you have a full size Glock in .40 S&W or .357 SIG, this is the upper you’ve been looking for!

In case you did not know, the .40 S&W and the .357 Sig use the same case.  The same round will fit & function in either magazine.  By changing out the barrel to the appropriate caliber your full size Glock can fire either caliber!

This ad is for a Mech Tech carbine upper in .357 Sig.  Shoots .357 Sig only!  Turn your full size Glock in .40 S&W or .357 Sig into a .357 Sig Carbine!  The upper comes as shown with BSA Red Dot site and CAA vertical fore-grip.
Clean and reliable blow back operation and a real blast to shoot. This is one of the rare adjustable /collapsible stock versions.  This is a legal rifle configuration for the Glock lower because you’re putting on a stock AND a 16 inch barrel all in one. Just putting a stock on a pistol is a big no-no. When assembled (real easy, anybody can do it) the manufacturer claims a 40% increase in muzzle velocity.  Simply remove your full size Glock upper, add the extended feed ramp (which just drops in & I’m including 2 of them) to the lower and then slide & lock the carbine upper onto the lower rails as you would during normal assembly.  Disassembly is the same as removing the normal Glock upper. NO special tools needed.
I’m also including two 30 round mags (not shown in photos) that will also take .357 or .40 S&W as noted above.

It's a left hand stock, right hand bolt (I've no idea why, bought it that way years ago but I'm right handed and it's never been a problem), but beautiful tiger striped walnut with satin finish. I've babied this rifle for years, has clean sharp rifling, good wood, and is sub -MOA with even Russian ammo. It's taken my first deer, coyote, bobcat, and with Barnes ammo, it can take deer, hogs, coyotes etc. at decent range. It's been my go to rifle for hunting on foot, and doubles as a bet winner on the farm! It's no problem to hit consistently with this lil guy inside of 400 yds (never used it further). It's the first bolt gun I ever owned, and it would do well as a truck/varmint/predator/deer/hog gun for a small kid, or even a fun gun for an adult.

I moved to Oklahoma from pa 7 years ago. I hunted there easily on millions of state game lands there. My son was 11, and just under hunting legal age. I have desired to take him hunting and shooting. The free outdoor range near Lexington is always packed with people. We don't know anyone who would let us hunt, but we are good GOD fearing and hard working family. I really am bothered that I haven't been able to foster a love of the outdoors and hunting in my son. I still have time... But I cannot pay much for hunting rights. I'm so used to people in Pennsylvania gladly permitting fellow sportsmen hunt on their land for free. Great friendships and bonds were built that way. Ok the question is what can I do? Where can I take my son to shoot and hunt reasonably? Is there anyone else experiencing this? Please reply with anything even sharing stories. Like to hunt for deer, small game, and ruffed grouse and pheasants. Thanks mark"
