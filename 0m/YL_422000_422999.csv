Just let me know what your offer is and we can go from there. I have read the first 10 myself and for those not familiar with the series, the books I have read so far are packed full of action. I do not know if you can go more than 10 pages without someone's life being on the line. Rating wise, the killing can be pretty graphic, I would describe the language as moderate, and there are themes that I would not recommend for children. I think the age range would be a mature 16 on up.

Like I said before, these books are action packed (sometimes to the point of ridiculousness) and deal with survival in a post nuclear war world.

Mfg description-
If you like heavy metal and need something larger than our standard 42-inch rifle carrying case, than this 46-inch Voodoo Tactical brand rifle carrying case is just the ticket. It is designed to safely hold larger battle rifles, such as the FAL, AR-10, M-1 Garand, M14 and M-16s and AR-15s with 20-inch barrels. As long as your overall lenth is 45 inches or less, it should fit fine.

Inside are adjustable tie downs so that you can be sure your optics are not going to get knocked about. The attention to detail and heavy thick foam on all six sides is a welcome change from the standard nylon case. It even features additional padding to protect your muzzle and the zippers are tough enough to meet the demanding conditions required by the military and law enforcement.

Behind the pouches, there's a second compartment (which you can't see too in the photo) with two padded pouches built in. Each is designed to hold a pistol, but you could also use these for optics or other accessories.

This case comes with the three external pouches you see here, giving you plenty of storage space for magazines, boxes of ammo, cleaning kits, your log book and other accessories. The three exterior pouches have gussets, making them hold far more than you would think. The two outside pouches can hold five or six magazines and the center pouch is even larger.

This gun case features three carrying methods: A standard handle in center of the bag, a shoulder strap, and back-pack style shoulder harness. This backpack style carry is great for long distances. And if you use the PAL webbing to attach MOLLE or ALICE pouches, you can haul even more gear."

This is a double/single action revolver that has matching numbers featuring a ramp fixed front sight, a square-notched adjustable rear sight and colt factory wooden grips with colt silver medallions  having a serial number of N07XXX that makes it manufactured in 1977 according to proofhouse.com. Has the markings of ""COLT'S PT FA MFG CO HARTFORD CONN USA"" on the right side of the barrel, has the markings ""DIAMONDBACK 38 SPECIAL CTG."" denoting the caliber on the left side of the barrel, the matching serial number ""N07XXX"" are on the inside of the frame when you open the cylinder and on the inside of the crane recess when you open the cylinder. This revolver mechanics works fine in both single and double action locking up tight with a small amount of play being in good cosmetic condition with the finish having turned to a nice even patina in most areas (as I am no expert in the grading of these just going on my opinion that defers from person to person) with the metal surface having normal handling marks and finish loss, the bore and cylinder chambers are in good condition with good lands, grooves and good rifling the entire length of the bore. The wooden grips are in good condition with normal handling marks with no visual breaks, cracks or repairs missing the ejector rod head cap/nut, but please see pics and ask questions if there is something we have not covered as we are not experts in these type of firearms. This would make a great shooter for the range, ccw gun or addition to your colt revolver collection to keep in your gun safe as these are becoming rare and harder to find in the short barrel configuration. Will drive to meet a reasonable distance to sale or trade this item to Missouri Residents FTF on a bill of sale or will ship upon receiving a clear payment and and a ink signed copy of a verifiable FFL paperwork for legal firearms transfer. Will trade towards Colt AR-15's, Glock Pistols, Colt & S&W Revolvers or Gold & Silver Coins. For more information please respond to this ad.

If you have an interesting AK that was assembled in the original country as a complete firearm such as an Egyptian Maadi, it is worth the money and effort just to say you own one, as these have always been considered the most authentic and closest to the Soviet AK-47s. Plus, it was assembled by the original Maadi AK factory team, not by some minimum wage worker for some large gun importer and distributor. This, if for no other reason, makes your post ban Maadi worth more than you think."

I've decided to sell a few guitars. This one is only a few months old. Rarely been played. I'm just more of a les Paul guy. I would consider another les Paul as a trade. 
The guitar is in excellent condition 
It's a 2011 custom classic model 
Comes with the original gibson case 


The ES-137 blends the looks and overall style of a single cutaway semi-hollowbody guitar and the sonic authority of a Gibson Les Paul Classic. It refines the basic design of earlier semi-hollowbody Gibsons by swapping the style's maple centerblock for solid mahogany to increase sustain and reduce feedback at even heavy metal volumes. With its single Florentine cutaway, the ES-137 Classic draws on the heritage of Gibson's earlier ES-135 and ES-175 models for historic inspiration, but sustain, sizzle, and some appealing non-traditional color options make it an absolutely contemporary instrument.

The ES-137 Classic shares Gibson 490 R and 498 T pickups with chrome and gold hardware options, including a Nashville Tune-O-Matic bridge and stopbar tailpiece. The instrument's neck is sturdy three-ply maple supporting a 22-fret rosewood fingerboard with pearloid inlays and single ply binding. It has a rounded profile and a 24-inch scale length and is 1 11/16th-inches wide at the nut. The tuners are Grover keystones. And complimenting the 490R and 498T humbuckers is the classic Gibson dual volume pot, dual tone pot, and three-way selector set configuration.

The ES-137 Classic comes strung with Gibson .010 Brite Wires and get a meticulous examination and dressing on one of the Custom Shop's state-of-the-art Pleck machines, ensuring optimum playability. With a black levant case, the ES-137 Classic leaves the Custom Shop ready to gig -- anywhere."

I am the second person to own this gun, and I haven't shot it.  The lady I got it from says she fired 200-300 rounds out of it over the period of a few years. It has a few light handling marks.  It does not come with the original box, or owners manual.  There is a cheap little holster with it as well.

 For those of you that are unfamiliar with Rossi handguns, they're made in Brazil by Taurus.  I've included some info below off the Rossi website.

MODEL R46202FC .357 MAGNUM 2"" BARREL IN STAINLESS STEEL
These handguns are built to the same quality and reliability standards that have been part of the Rossi name for over 100 years.  Rossi offers medium and small frame revolvers in various barrel lengths-all feature deep, contoured finger grooves in the grip for a solid grasp and maximum shooting comfort.  Rossi revolvers are machined from forged steel and will routinely fire powerful .38 Special +P rounds for the lifetime of your revolver.

According to Rossi, MSRP on a new one is $461. 

Going rate on gunbroker.com is $350-365 for new.  I'm asking $300 cash OBO.  No trades will be entertained.

Please have NC CCP or pistol purchase permit in hand.  No exceptions will be made.  Buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale, which you will be provided a copy of at the sale.  I will not travel, I will not ship.  This is a face to face transaction.

The ever-feared race gun is generally a pistol that is designed to eliminate the competition and is a favorite modification of the Para Ordnance long slide pistols. It allows users to hand load lighter charges, ensuring both less recoil and no competition from factory pistol shooters. Despite many people criticizing these types of competitive shooters, they get results. In fact these shooters have, in many areas, cornered the competition, making other shooters emulate the very tactic they profess to despise. But like any other sport, the innovations are spread around until there are a fair amount of users to make it an everyday occurrence, rather than a display of pure dedication. Para Ordnance firearms are here to stay and poised to give Americans another great import from our all-but-forgotten neighbor to the north. I would recommend a Para Ordnance firearm to any of my clients or acquaintances. After my many years of shooting, I think these relative newcomers take competitive shooting to the next level without missing a beat. Despite the bulky price of many Para Ordnances, these firearms really are a prime example of getting what you pay for, especially when considering the lack of quality from some of the lower priced competitors. So in closing I would highly recommend any of the Para Ordnance pistols for anybody looking to smash their competition for IDPA or one of the many other popular firearms related sports.
It has all upgraded internal's including a SS Skelatonized Trigger, Match Grade Bull Barrel, SS Slide,SS Back Strap, SS Bobbed Hammer, etc. The Serial number is RF 44XX.

Fired 50 rounds. Still needs to be broken in.

It has been Cerakoted with Magpul Foliage Green and Graphite Black. This pistol can be seen on the Cerakote website 1911 gallery of professional application pictures.

The trigger has been taken down to a smooth crisp 3-3.5 lbs.

Comes with box, papers, test shells, lock, 2 7rd mags, and an extra 8rd mag, which have all been Cerakoted Foliage Green to match the pistol.
Has a Wilson Combat Match adjustable trigger, and shock buffer.
Also has 75.00 VZ G-10 Slim Profile grips with Pearce finger groove panels underneath. The stock grips also included.

The Cerakote and gunsmith work has been done by Zeroed In at Robinson's Hardware in Cheney, Ks. Not in the garage by me.
They have pictures of it in some of their ads. And they have lifetime warranty on their finishes.

Total cost of gun, custom work and parts came to around 850 with tax.
These guns stock/factory go for around 575.00 or more with tax, fees, etc. depending on where you buy it.

I dont have to sell this, not hurting for cash, will keep it if it does'nt sell for my asking price, so lowball offers will not get a response.

If you can buy the same pistol with all that has been done to it for less than this, you'd better jump on it.

This pistol is fantastic, yet I rarely shoot it and prefer my wheel guns. At this point I am open to all offers, so bring them on. Below is a list of what I like and the pertinent specs of the pistol.

HK P7, four digit serial number. This was a lower Saxony Polizei gun that was rated ""Grade A"" by HK. I have the original box, manual, scraper, brush, four magazines, trijicon tritium sights installed (2009 vintage, plenty bright), original sights, four magazines coated in NP3 at Robar, Black Hills leather IWB holster and of course the pistol.

Speaking of the pistol, I sent it ro Robar a few years back to have it refinished. The pistol was covered in Roguard black matte finish with NP3 on the internals and moving bits. The pistol looks fantastic as the photos show below. I have never carried it and the pistol is in top condition, as are the magazines and holster.

This particular Ruger pistol is a limited edition from Talo which comes engraved from the factory. These are no longer available to purchase from Ruger in this special edition and have become rather scarce to find. It's a VERY sharp looking pistol. 

I purchased this pistol new in April of 2011 and I have put approximately 300 rounds through it at the range since then. No misfires and no jams. The gun has been meticulously cleaned and maintained throughout the time I have owned it. I bought it as a concealed carry weapon, but I recently purchased a Walther PPK and I no longer have a need for the Ruger LCP.

Make an offer if you wish to buy. I am open to the idea of a trade on a decent hunting rifle or another handgun. 

I can see right through scammers, so don't waster your time. Local pickup only."

Prevents rust and corrosion. Apply Weapons Lubricant Improved to trigger groups, bolt carriers, operating rods, slides, magazines, and barrels of pistols, rifles, and other weapons.

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm

These are one of the best AR's currently on the market and are getting very difficult to find! DD has all but stopped taking orders for rifles this year! I can order any suppressor you need to complement this great rifle as well!

DPMS LR-308 W/Springfield Armory FFP 4-14x56 Scope 7.62 reticule. A great tactical rifle, this DPMS LR-308. Chambered for .308 NATO, the rifle has a host of technical features, a heavy, free-floating barrel,  The rifle is in fine to excellent condition, However it has been fired and shows handling marks. This is not a Safe Queen – that means that the finish, stocks, and the bore all rate about 90+% condition. 24"" STAINLESS STEEL Heavy Barrel 1-10"" Twist , A2 Stock, 8620 steel bolt carrier, Right hand ejection, 1-5 round magazine, Flat Top Picatinny Rail Receiver. Ergo tactical grip with palm shelf and Harris Bipod. 

THE LOW DOWN ON THE SCOPE
This is a Springfield Front Focal Plane scope with a range finding reticule with brackets out to 1,000 meters. Makes ranging targets quick and easy. Plus it being a Front Focal scope the hashes work for drop at any magnification, not just the highest setting like on second focal plane scopes from Leupold, Nightforce, etc. 

This is the only scope I know of with drop points in the 308 caliber.  Schmidt & Bender, US Optics, Premier Heritage, Zeiss Hensoldt, Nightforce, Leupold Mark 4's, etc. and none of them make a reticle for the 7.62x51

 This one has drop's every 100 meters from 200 to 1,000 when using 168 grain match ammo. It has an internal bubble level to make sure you are dead center before the shot. The 56mm objective is oversized and provides ample light gathering ability especially with the 30mm tube. I think this website summed it up best:

 The 1st Generation scope is ballistically tuned for 7.62 (.308) match ammo and with its large objective lens delivers superior light gathering capability, even in low light conditions. This rugged, variable power scope features slim no snag windage and elevation knobs, and is perfect for a variety of serious law enforcement, counter sniper, and hunting applications. Variable Power 4-14x56, Patented Range finding Reticule with hands free automatic bullet drop compensation for 7.62 (.308) match ammo to 1000 meters, 30mm tube and patented internal bubble level.

 Here is some more info from an old Springfield Brochuere:
Very Finest Optical Quality and Resolution Len's
Proprietary Coatings for Maximum Light Transmission
Rugged Monotube Construction
Nitrogen Filled for Fog Free Use
Permanently Centered Reticules
Shock Proof and Water Proof
Lifetime Warranty
Internal Level
Patented Range finding Reticule

 The Internal Bubble Level is a very cool feature. Did you know that as little as a 10 degree cant can put the bullet 6 feet off target at 1,000 Meters!

 The reticle is calibrated for a 168 grain bullet at 2,550 FPS. Plus some other cool info. These are loads that also very closely match the ballistics of the above 308 load. 
7.62x39 125 grain at 2,900 FPS
 30-06 Springfield 180 grain at 2,650 FPS
8mm Mauser 150 grain at 2,800 FPS
375 H&H 300 grain Boat Tail at 2,500 FPS

 You are suppose to zero the scope to be dead on at 200 meters. Once you are zero'd the small crosshairs next to the meter markings are dead on for those ranges. 

You can use the brackets of varying sizes to quickly range the target then use the yardage markers to make your shot."
