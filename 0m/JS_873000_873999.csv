S&W M&P 15-22 quad rail retractable stock. With a 3x9 scope. I've had it for trade been looking for a .45. Was only trying to trade but I've had pretty much all cash offers so itsfor sale now make an offer. If you have any 45 pistols or semiauto shotguns (not interested in pumps) let me know maybe we can make a deal can add cash or may request cash. I'm into trading guns or buying guns, not into ripping anyone off or getting ripped so if that's your agenda go to another post.

Shoot me an e-mail with any questions about the Glock. Don't be afraid to send an offer, the worst i could say is no, but thank you. Thanks for looking!"

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip.

These are the bullets only used for reloading.
Brand new in box. I received these in a lot of ammo from someones estate but i do not have this caliber rifle but maybe you do and reload your own cartridges and want to save some money. If so here they are cheaper than you can buy them anywhere for. I see these running anywhere between $36.00-$40.00 per box of 50. Yours for $40.00 for both boxes. Thats like buy 1 get 1 free.  Trades for other complete ammo cartridges considered if they fit calibers of rifles i have.

This is not the typical big box store AR. This AR was custom built by an industry leader. This is your opportunity to own a high quality rifle that will provide you years of excellent service.

Nobody could have predicted the success of Les Baer Custom’s Police Special, the special 16” AR that was designed to include every important feature a police officer wants but none of the stuff he doesn’t. Nobody but Les Baer who knew there was a need for a high performance rifle that could serve as either a patrol carbine or a high energy tactical rifle. For 2012, Les has sweetened the pot even a little more by adding a few additional high demand law enforcement features including a new LBC national match carrier, a six position M-4 style collapsible stock, and a very special LBC flip-up front sight.

As a patrol carbine or a high energy tactical rifle, the Les Baer Police Special is the new class of the law enforcement market. It’s loaded with the thoughtful, businesslike features that make it a serious pro, and it’s intentionally devoid of the amateur gee-gaws that cheapen the purpose and limit the usefulness of a police rifle for real police work.

Features include:
• LBC forged and machined upper and lower receiver • Removable carry handle with rear sight • Picatinny flattop rail on upper • LBC National Match carrier, chromed • Precision bolt and extractor • 16” precision button rifled steel barrel with 1 X 8 twist • LBC flip-up front sight • six position M-4 style collapsible stock­ • Special Picatinny 4-way handguard, free floated • Lockable sling swivel mounted on stud on 4-way handguard • 1” nylon sling • A2 style flash hider • Bead blast blue finish on steel parts • Anodized finish on aluminum parts • Timney Match trigger group • (2) 30-round magazines

Rifles are guaranteed to shoot 1"" groups at 100 yards.
