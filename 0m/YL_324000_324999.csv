This is an Auto-Ordnance “Thompson” line of 1911 style pistols. Thompson pistols are still being made under their current owner Kahr Arms. This particular one pre-dates that acquisition and is sometimes called a “West Hurley” Thompson, named after the manufacture city of its time.

In its early years of production it was made from military parts on a Essex frame and slide with a commercial colt barrel. The highest quality guns are thought to be SN AOC4000 and lower. (This gun is AOC22**) It's manufacture date is pre-1983. At a weighty 46.7 oz (2 lbs, 14.7oz), this Thompson is a hefty, dark, sleek looking gun. The front sight is a massive blade with no angle cuts to it.  Hogue wrap-around combat grips were added and provide an excellent grip for shooting. It has a beautiful patina, with some wear typical of a shooter of it's age. Included is a Pachmayer 7 rd. magazine.

This is a great  1911 .45ACP shooter!"

I am offering the following package deal at a pretty reasonable discount.  The ammunition consists of 3,080 rounds priced at less than $0.20/round compared to the usual $0.30/round.  I priced the rifle at about $300 and about $75 for all the included extras (scope, peep sight, magazines, folding stock, tactical case, etc.).

The rifle itself has had a total of maybe 500 rounds down the pipe.  I bought it in the original “cosmoline” and have maintained it properly to include cleaning correctly immediately after any use. The rifle looks excellent with a nice and shiny bore and all serial numbers match.

Particulars:
SKS with the milled (not stamped) trigger group and chrome lined barrel in 7.62x39 
Four hermetically sealed tins with 550 rounds of 7.62x39 each (2200 total)
2 unopened bulk packages of 100 rounds each 
34 boxes with 20 rounds each
2 metal 20 round removable magazine
3 polymer 30 round removable magazines
Original 10 round fixed magazine 
ATI folding stock with rubber butt pad (currently mounted)
Original wood stock with metal butt plate, sling swivel & trigger group spring
Williams adjustable peep sight (mounted and works purty darn well)
Original rear ladder sight
3-9x32 illuminated compact scope with battery and rings
Receiver cover with integral see-through scope mount
Original and 2 additional spare receiver covers
Original compact cleaning kit that fits into the stock
Blade bayonet
Flash suppressor (mounted)
16 stripper clips (probably more in the sealed tins)
Midway tactical gun sock (with silicone)
Midway padded tactical soft carry case with 6 magazine and one zippered pouch
Bandoleer with 10 pockets
Web sling

Not pictured are the original stock which is in very good condition (no dings / scratches), the small additional parts or the 34 boxes of 20 rounds apiece.  The picture was already too busy and you already know what those look like.

I am shooting much more rimfire these days and want some more room in the safe so I think this should go to someone who will use it.  There is enough in this package to keep you having fun for as long as you want. I am letting this go for about a 30% discount over what everything would sell for individually.  The market price for the ammunition alone is worth almost as much as the asking price for the entire package.

I am asking $975 Cash. Face to Face transaction and you must be able to legally own a firearm. Colorado ID and receipt required. All federal, state and local gun statutes apply.

I live in the Colorado Springs area but could meet as necessary.  I have some more photos if needed."

Way cheaper than purchasing a conversion kit for $300

 P226 Stainless elite chambered in .40 caliber plus I have the 357 barrel conversion for it. Comes with 2 magazines that works with either caliber, Sig Case, lock, owner's manual etc. 

The gun is very clean and hasn't been fired much, maybe 100 rounds through each barrel. Sig manufacture date is September 2011 so the gun is no more than 6 months old.

CCW holders preferred, must have valid OH driver's license.

How do you improve on the world’s best pistol? By adding enhanced ergonomics and new features including an enhanced trigger system with an astounding short reset. The new P226® Elite Stainless is the next generation P226 and features an ergonomic beavertail grip, front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, custom wood grips and the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. SIG engineers designed the SRT to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting."

Complete M4 AR-15 upper ... ready to mount onto your lower.
90 rounds shot through this upper.

I am getting away from the AR-15 platform and selling.
These have low round count and have been kept in a climate controlled gun safe. 

RGuns 16"" 1:9 twist barrel, upper receiver and bolt carrier group

The custom machined match barrels used are made from 4150 chrome-moly vanadium steel manufactured in the USA. Every 5.56 NATO/.223 barrel is properly head spaced with an M4 feed ramp extension installed.

Barrels are particle tested, air gauged, concentrically cut and muzzle threaded ½ -28 R.H. twist to accept flash hiders/suppressors, then stressed relieved, turned on center to prevent accuracy robbing distortion for when the barrel heats up, also hardened to 26-33 Rc giving the barrel a long life. 

Each barrel has an eleven degree crown, polished chamber and lapped bore, combined with pulled-button rifling, thus producing a superbly accurate bore diameter with uniform rate of twist. 

RAIL:
Samson 15"" Evo Rail with bi-pod mount.

Magpul MBUS flip up sights (matched).

The upper originally came with an A2 front sight which has been cut down and re-blacked so the extended rail and flip up sights could be installed.
The gas block timing has been kept in tact and shell extraction is perfect.

I have been reading alot about the 16 gauge ever since I decided to sell this beautiful piece of history it was know as a gun that feels like a 20 gauge but 
shots birds like a 12 gauge and I am seeing more and more 16 gauge shells 
on the shelves now too. I saw this same gun in a 20 gauage sell for 895 on 
Gunsamerica. After doing some more research I found out that this gun was made In the 20's and 30's. Again beautiful shape no rust barrels are great. 
Even the Wood looks great. I would also consider trading for nice handgun large caliber or a nice dear hunting gun. Lever action 30-30, I just lowered the price to 325.00 this is any easy 500 dollar gun in the condition its in. Now its a steal"

Better Hearing - Better Protection - QUIETPRO

Communication clarity and full situational awareness is crucial in all stages of tactical deployment. High steady noise generated by vehicles and high impulse noise from weapons and explosions degrades and sometimes block communications. This noise also causes temporary and sometimes permanent damage to soldiers hearing.

QUIETPRO greatly improves the crucial stages of communication in noisy surroundings while protecting, but not overprotecting, the users from these complex and damaging noises. It ‘enhances’ soldiers hearing where and when needed, significantly improving their natural auditory senses. It is fully compatible with most communication equipment and all military ground vehicle and aviation ballistic helmets and CBRN protection gear.

The unique combination of QUIETPRO features provides increased capability to soldiers, performing their duty in harsh and dangerous environments."

This rifle sells for $1450+ new, and the magazines are $50+ each.  So new this package would cost $1700+.  I am asking $1200 for everything. I apologize for the lousy camera phone pics, but thats all I've got to work with right now. Really looking for cash as this will be funding a new AR-10 build but might consider some trades.  Let me know what you have, if you don't get a response assume I'm not interested. Email or text 414-248-97fournine.  Currently only interested in selling locally to WI residents for FTF transaction. Must be able to present ID for proof of age.
