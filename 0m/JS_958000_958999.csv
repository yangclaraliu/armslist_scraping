The good news is that it is new, the bad news is is that it was new in the early 1990s and it has storage wear on the stock's finish. 

I did my best to try and document where the shiny finish has been taken off in  the photos. The wood is not damaged but the finish is not up to my standards, the rifle still looks very nice. The only other weird thing I have noticed is the bayonet does not have the correct pivot bolt. The only thing I have ever done with this rifle is let it take up real estate in the safe. As you can see it is still dripping with cosmoline and will need a breakdown and cleaning before use (I guess unused has it drawbacks). It has the cleaning rod and the kit in the stock but no sling or paperwork. 

I am looking for a 12 gauge pump gun with 18 or 20 in barrel and a full length tube it does not have to be perfect, just mechanically sound. I would prefer police department markings but that is not a deal breaker. I like weird stuff so marked Winchester 97, Ithaca 37, a hi cap BPS, US marked Stevens 520 or other odd stuff will get my attention. But if you have an 870 or 590 I am all ears too. I might be willing to work a deal with cash for a FNH TPS (I should never have sold my last one)"

Blackhole Weaponry Barrels employ the use of 416R, match grade stainless steel. BHW Barrels specialize in Polygonal rifling; The shape of the lands and grooves are based on a circle, so there are no sharp corners or edges for the bullet to conform into. This means there is a tight seal and thus less bullet deformation. This rifling form is unique in its ability to allow the bullet to be centered and fully supported by the barrel’s bore.This arc shaped rifling has long been held in very high regard for its accuracy, increased velocity, reduced gas cutting and ease of cleaning.

Its got a CBRPS bullpup kit on it, the latest model with the tactical trigger. Which has been tuned by myself to provide even better trigger feel, and this is not some backyard trigger job, i have a degree in gunsmith technology. Key features of this stock include folding vertical grip, pistol grip, carry handle/picatinny rail, accessory rail added by me, and an onboard extra mag carrier. Its a full metal frame with polymer grips. And CBRPS has a great engineering design on how the receiver attaches to the stock, the equivalent to a glass and pillar bedded action on a standard configuration rifle. Other modifications include a Volquartsen target hammer, that reduces trigger pull to 3lbs. And a brownells extractor that has a longer service life and more positive extraction than the standard remington extractor. Accessories included are a Truglo red dot sight, simmons .22mag scope 3-9 (w rings), remington extractor, hammer, front and rear sights, original stock that has a free floated barrel channel and a desert camo paint job, 2 30 round mags, 1 10 round mag. And ive got a box of win bulk and federal auto match ill include also. 

This rifle is very accurate, and has been cleaned and lubricated after every firing or 1 month of storage. I am meticulous with my cleaning and maintenance. Included is everything needed to configure it many ways with sight and stock combinations. OAL with bullpup stock is 26.75"", weight w/full 30 rd mag and full 10rd in the carrier and red dot is 6.75 lbs.

I am mostly interested in trading it. Primarily for a .45 caliber handgun, 1911s, a Sig 220, h&k usp or a FNP .45 to name a few. Would consider a 45/70 or a 458 Lott also. I have cash in hand if you feel your trade justifies it. Ar10 or AR 15 is always considered too, no outrageous asking prices please (also must be capible of shooting NATO pressure rounds). But you can always make me an enticing cash offer too... 

Also please take a minute to email your representatives to voice your opinions against any legislation restricting the 2nd Amendment in the forms of an AWB or high capacity magazine bans.

Also, notice the color inlay receiver and the three position ""bullet"" selector. The upper is in a really cool, custom digital urban camo and it has H&K-style iron sites. 

This weapon is NOT a safe queen. This gun gets used and gets shot and has the markings you'd expect to see from a gun that has seen some range time. If you buy it you won't look like some newby as you strut onto the range or your next class. You'll be all hardcore-looking... in fact, this thing is so hardcore-looking that you might have to call James Yeager and see if he'll loan you some of his tight t-shrits to wear while you're shooting this bad boy. 

I DO NOT want to sell this for cash (unless you just won the Lotto and REALLY want to wear one of James' shirts), so I'd rather trade it for something cool. What? I don't know; surprise me. Maybe a cool mid-length carbine of some sort as I'm toying with the idea of doing some 3-gun but will be a rebel and do it with a 16"" length gun. Or a shorter barreled gun with a fake can or something to make it legal. MUST BE 100% LEGAL. Hell, I don't know what I want; this ad is a fishing expedition. Maybe a couple of HIGH QUALITY pistols (don't email me to trade your Taurus and your Jimenz Arms stuff please)."

1 x Romanian 75 round drum for AK-47, caliber 7.62x39. This is the ""European"" style drum that loads the rounds one-at-a-time from the top. Completely cleaned and de-cosmolined. Used, like new, functions flawlessly.  $200

2 x KCI inc (South Korean military) extended magazine for Glock .40 pistols (Fits models 22, 23, 27, and 35).  Holds 31 rounds of .40 S&W ammunition.  New, never used.  Has magazine catch cutouts on the right and front for both standard and ""Glock 21 SF style"" magazine catches (no cutout on the left side - will not work for ""left-handed"" magazine catch that is optional with the new Gen4 pistols - but it does work just fine with the standard Gen4 mag catch).  Excellent quality, second only to Glock factory magazines (Which to my knowledge are not made in this larger 31 round size for the .40) most people cannot tell them apart from Glock factory mags.   $100 each.

AR-15/M-16 magazines, 30 rounds:

1 x ""Defense Solutions Group / Magpul"" magazine, with Magpul enhanced follower, used excellent/like new.  $60.

1 each, ""Okay Industries"" and ""Parsons Precision Products"" - both genuine USGI magazines with original green plastic followers, used and functionally very good (cosmetically fair).  $50 each. 

1 x Unknown manufacture, commercial quality, former LE, blued-steel magazine. For range work, fair condition.  $40

Buy all four 30 round magazines, and I'll knock $20 off the total AND throw in a genuine USGI used 30-round magazine pouch for FREE.  So you get all four magazines and a mag pouch for $180

AR-15/M16 20 round magazines:

1 x ""Colt AR-15"" USGI surplus 20 round magazine.
4 x ""Adventure Line"" USGI surplus 20 round magazines.

20 round mags are all in Very Good to Excellent condition, have metallic no-tilt followers, and all feed/function 100%.  They were surplus USGI, then were carried on duty by an LEO as ""personal mags"" up until December.  $40 each, or save $20 when you buy all five ($180 for all).



Or...
I will trade the entire lot straight across for a Ruger Super Redhawk Alaskan 454 Casull, FTF private transfer in AZ or via FFL from any other state.


Shipping:  All items to ship via USPS Flat-rate box.  I will combine items to save on shipping.  Buyer to pay actual shipping cost.

Current USPS shipping rates (the rates did increase earlier this week, I wanted you to have a heads up):  Small flat-rate box (will fit a couple 20 round mags) $5.80
Medium flat-rate box (will fit the AK drum alone, or the 30 round AR mags, or the Glock mags) $12.35
Large flat-rate box (will fit multiple items together, maybe the whole lot) $16.85
Insurance and USPS tracking info available, with buyer to pay actual cost.


Terms and conditions:
Payment via cash or PayPal only.  Do not mention firearm related items if using PayPal, as they are anti-gun and in the past have cancelled accounts for firearm accessory related purchases. Must send payment as a ""gift"".  If neither of these options work for you, I will accept a USPS money order for an additional 5% charge, and shipping may be delayed until the payment clears.

Do not ask if these items are still for sale - if this ad is up, they are still for sale.  I will update this ad as items are sold.

Do not attempt to haggle, all prices are firm.

No sales to any area where posession would violate any state, local, or federal law.  This means no sales to DC, CA, NY, MA, MD, HI, or any city/county/other where posession is contrary to law (no matter how stupid that law is).  Simply put, don't waste either of our time.  If anyone insists on asking me to break any law, I will report you to whatever law enforcement agency has jurisdiction, simply for wasting my time.

To purchase:
Email with the items you are interested in and your SHIPPING ZIP CODE (to verify shipping charges and legality of shipping to that area), and I will reply with your total cost (including least expensive shipping, depending on how many items I can fit in the box).  At that point, you will send payment via PayPal along with your full shipping address (ZIP CODE MUST BE THE SAME), and I will mail your items ASAFP.

The story behind this rifle

My favorite precision rifle, a Remington 700 in .308 caliber, was very accurate out to 700 yards. Ballistically, it was capable of hitting targets at 1,000 yards, but it was awfully tricky as the .308 starts to lose steam past 800 yards. It is not the .308’s forte. 

I started looking for a rifle that could punch out to 1,000 yards without a lot of trouble. Savage rifles were well known for superb “out-of the box” accuracy, and the relatively new 300 RUM cartridge had a great reputation as a strong, long distance round, so I purchased this rifle in that caliber and modified it into a dedicated 1,000 yard rifle. The heavy stock and the muzzle brake tame the famous recoil of the 300 Ultra Mag cartridge. 

I have been very happy with the performance of this rifle, but unfortunately, the cost of ammo has tripled since I bought it, and I no longer have the desire to shoot it. I do not reload, nor do I have any desire to take up that hobby, so I made the decision to part with it. 

If you are a reloader, this would be affordable for you to shoot. 

If you want to hit a target 1,000 yards and beyond predictably and with ease, then this is the rifle for you.

Has a big old heavy 1x4 scope that the cross hairs light up on it that I hate carrying around. Also has a shiny barrel which shines so the enemy can see ya. I got 5 of the magazines with the windows in it which shows how much ammo you got incase you're out of ammo and need to bluff out of a situation you can't, not like the good old solid black chinese made ones. The cheap plastic stock has an M on it, and has the two little click levers that can snag on things. Not like the better lighter ones that just have one lever. The trigger guard has a spider on it too and the safety switch is clunky and big and is on both sides. Really gets in the way. Has a flashlight mount and front little handle too. Not like the streamlines sporticals that don't have all that extra junk. This ones got the forearm stock thing that has the sharp metal ridges. Kinda cuts our hand up when you shoot. Not like the good old smooth ones. Anyway, I got a few rounds to go with it too. Stupid me bought too much of it a couple months ago. Maybe someone could use it or trade me out some target round 9mm. Some of the tips of them have a green plastic tip on the very end? maybe they are rubber bullets or blanks or something.

GT is one of the cleanest, hottest, and most accurate rounds available. It has a boat tail projectile that tumbles like the famed Yugo M67, but is non-corrosive. It is imho the best bulk ammo for an AK or similar rifle available today in terms of terminal ballistics. Always been a little more per round than the Wolf/Tula crap, and always worth it.

I acquired this last year and it is in great condition, but I bought it wanting a work horse gun and this gun to me is more flash than tool. 

It is a 3rd generation S&W 4506 that has had the slide flats machined and brought to a semi polish. A previous owner did this to remove the Smith and Wesson roll marks in order to make it a cleaner looking pistol. It also comes with Novak night sights and has had all the springs replaced, so it is nice and tight. The pistol also comes with hogue grips, all the original materials, Safariland duty holster (NEW) and 5 stainless S&W magazines (about $40 each new). I haven't fired a single shot through this gun and am looking to sell or trade it **SEE BELOW**

I am looking to trade for one of the following:
-Smith and Wesson 1911
-Springfield Armory 1911 (pref. loaded model)
-Smith and Wesson 4506 w/ adjustable sights
-Glock 21 3rd generation
-Sig P220R
Open to offers on full size .45 autos.

Or will sell the gun outright with 5 mags, holster and everything I have for it for $800.

It has the front pistol grip on the handguard.  These haven't been imported with the original barrels in years, making these very sought after.

Im tired of this state. All of us law abiding gun owners have to suffer with the new laws. We follow the laws of this land. We think and act responsible so we can have these rights and they keep taking more right from us. While the non law abiding scumbags get to do what they want. All these laws will only do one thing drive up the black market and put more guns in non abiding hands. This state treats us like criminals when you apply for your carry permit or buy a rifle and now even ammo. Whats next ? Take away your shotgun because its considered a item of massdestuction or your bolt action because it gets labeled a sniper rifle and we dont need a firearm that can shoot distance. Maybe even take away bb guns? Dont say it cant happen you give up a little and they want it all. We work with them and they tell us thats not enough, that it is going to be there way. They take away the 2nd amendment next when our kids are older they take away freedom of speech. Then our grandchildren are told what they can do and where they can do it. The sheeple need to wake up. Our elected officals will not be getting my vote next time. And NYS will not be getting anymore money from me for hunting licences. Let them figure out how they are going to come up with the loss of revenue from people boycotting this and I hope out of staters refuse to buy out of state licences. Calling and emailing our elected officals did nothing they made there own choices not what the people want. I hope fellow law abiding citizens That belive in the 2nd amendment stand with me and hurt there pockets.Its the only way to do it. They dont care that remington will lose jobs, but if NY elected officals dont have enough money to add jobs for there friends and family or to pay for the added pork in the laws. Then they will open there eyes. NYS GETS OVER $18,500,000 IN CONSERVATION GROSS REVENUE FROM US. LETS TAKE IT AWAY. If you belive in your rights stand with me and boycott if we dont need our rights then they dont need our money.Its the only way! 99% can get meat from the store and skip a year hunting maybe a few years until they listen.
God bless"

The scope is a 3-9x40 UTG Tactical scope with mil-dots. The five 30 round mags come with it, the original SIG case and owners manuals will come with it, this rifle has had 42 rounds through it without a single failure, meticulously cleaned and cared for, stored in an environment controlled safe, this is a perfect package deal, invest in your own future, your kids future and invest now while you can. This is design is an ak-47 modernized, much more ergonomic than an ak-47 and with all the reliability you expect from a piston operation system. I will ship this to a dealer, I am an individual and my state allows transfer of long guns from an individual to a dealer, if your dealer will not work with me however I can have the gun shipped from a dealer to your dealer for an additional $20.

This rifle is extremely accurate in comparison to others of its caliber, at 200 meters there's about 8"" drop and I can put all my shots in a group of 3"" or better without a bench rest. The tactical turrets move 1/4"" every click at 100 yards.

I own this rifle and you will not get backordered with me, or any other bullshit thats going on right now with stores."

All major metal components on the USP are corrosion-resistant. Outside metal surfaces are protected by H&K’s proprietary “hostile environment” nitride finish. Internal metal parts are coated with a Dow Corning anti-corrosion chemical to reduce friction and wear.

 The gunmaker tested the MK23′s recoil system with over 30k rounds of +P ammunition followed by 6k high pressure proof rounds. After disassembling the gun the Germans found no damage or excessive wear to any of the components.

 And then they did some more tests . . .

 The ballistic boffins froze the USP to −42 °C (−43.5 °F), fired it and then frozen it again. They heated it to 67 °C (152.6 °F) and fired it. They cycled between these extremes several times. They subjected USP to standard NATO mud and rain abuse. They immersed it in water and sprayed it with sea water. They dropped it from six feet, hammer first, onto a steel-backed concrete slab.

 H&K employees deliberately lodged a bullet in the barrel and then sent another one down the pipe. The second bullet cleared the obstruction producing only a minor bulge in the barrel. They loaded a full magazine and then fired the gun again with the bulging barrel. The resulting group measured less than 4 inches of deviation at 25 meters – a standard that some new guns would be lucky to hold.

 In short, Heckler & Koch , The selected gun by the US Seal Teams."
