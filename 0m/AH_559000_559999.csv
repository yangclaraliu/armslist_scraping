The Aimpoint CompM4 is now the latest version of the US Army's M68 CCO (Close-Combat Optic), continuing a legacy that Aimpoint has maintained since 1997. The Aimpoint CompM4 is the finest sight that Aimpoint has ever produced. Improvements include increased energy efficiency that provides over 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery! The Aimpoint CompM4 incorporates an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring, and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a varity of weapon systems.

The performance of the Aimpoint CompM4 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is especially suited for 3rd generation night vision technology. Aimpoint's unique band-pass coating on the front lens reflects select frequencies of red light at near 100% efficiency in order to give the highest possible dot brightness with the smallest amount of energy while transmitting nearly 100% of light in the Infrared and near-infrared part of the spectrum to provide the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation NVD. With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 Daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Aimpoint CompM4 is ready for duty 24/7."

A 4.25"" bushing barrel allows field strip anywhere, and keeps the weight down when compared to pistols of comparable size with tapered cone barrels.
When it comes time to choose your everyday carry gun there is a lot to consider. You need something that is reliable, accurate, and easy to wear. You need something that you can enjoy shooting a lot, because there is no substitute for practice. That's where the T3 comes in. They designed this pistol to be pleasing to the eye, but also to be a workhorse that can stand up to thousands of rounds.
The T3 has the best features for any gun its size. The frame is based on the Officer model, but for those with large hands, it features an extended magazine well that gives you the length you need to get all your fingers on the grip. The extension also serves another function: the hand-cut geometric angles really add to its beauty. The slide is a 4.25"" Commander length that affords a better sight radius.
Another consideration is weight. The T3 actually weighs one ounce lighter than most officer size 1911s. This makes the T3 the first choice for an all-day carry pistol. 
Heinie Slant-Pro Straight Eights Night Sights are standard. White outline front sight with Tritium makes daytime sight acquisition faster, rear sight has only Tritium, so your eyes quickly pick up the front post.
Serrations provide a ""no snag"" system. Sights, rear of slide, and mainspring housing all have horizontal serrations rather than checkering. The top of the slide is also serrated to reduce glare. A Nighthawk Custom© lightweight aluminum trigger that has been blacked-out using Perma Kote™ breaks between 3.5 and 4 lbs with no creep. When you put all of these features in one package, you come up with the finest carry gun you can own. All you add is practice.

Price is $300 FTF within a reasonable radius of Harrisburg, PA.  I am willing to ship through my local FFL to an FFL of the buyer's choice; the buyer is responsible for all shipping-related costs, which I estimate will be no more than $25.

Also available separately, offered first to the buyer of the gun, is the factory 5"" barrel kit and optic mount, used, for $75, and two new third-party 10-round magazines from keepshooting.com, $35 for the pair.  I will accept $100 for the bundle from the gun's buyer.  If the gun sells without these accessories, I will post them separately later.

The R.E.P.R. rifle allows you to assault-shoot with the 12” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The REPR rifle utilizes LWRC's patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows you to reload without removing your eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails – which are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key - provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.
All Sniper models are upgraded with Geissele Triggers. The Geissele Automatics National Match will lighten the trigger pull relative to a standard trigger. This lightened trigger pull will make the weapon easier to discharge.

The NORINCO M97 has an 18.5"" barrel and is chambered for 12 gauge, 2 and 3/4 inch shells. True to the original military issued M97s, this gun features the correct 6-row heat shield, ""US"" and Army Ordinance Corp ""Flaming Bomb"" stamps, sling mounts, and bayonet lug for mounting the US M1917 bayonet. Unlike many NORINCO imports, this gun does not have a trigger disconnect (like the original Winchester 1897s) which allows the gun to be rapidly ""slam fired"". I bought this gun new and have only fired about 50 shells through it. The gun has a blued finish with hand rubbed American Walnut furniture. The gun is in excellent condition, both mechanically and aesthetically, having only a couple minor scratches on the stock. Comes with a reproduction of the military issue M7 leather sling. This model is currently no longer being imported to the United States.

This shotgun's compact size and rapid pump capabilities make it perfect for any bug-out kit or home defense.

Also, this comes with a Wolf Industries match grade 9mm conversion barrel, in addition to the Glock 27 .40 factory barrel. You literally just take out the .40 barrel, drop in this match grade 9mm conversion barrel and you now have a GLOCK 26 9mm. No gunsmithing or adjustments required. It's really that simple. I planned on training on the 9mm ammo to save money, and carrying the .40 CCW for increased stopping power.

I'll also include a load of mags in sub-compact and full-size in both .40 and 9mm. Two (2) of those mags will come with a custom designed ""biohazard"" aluminum floor plate. The custom floor plates will fit any Glock factory 9mm or .40 magazine, and you can change them out. Lastly, I'll also include two Blackhawk CQC holsters: one is a black leather pancake holster, and the other is a Serpa polymer holster with a finger safety release on the side. Both are perfect for concealed carry.

This entire package is LIKE NEW, and has everything you could possibly ever need, and more... seriously. I purchased all this for off-duty use, but ended up never using it. The gun has only had 50 rounds put through it, with no issues.

This price is insanely awesome - I'm taking a $450 hit, not even including the sales tax and other costs I paid. Plus I'm eliminating the hassle and costs of finding the right products and installing them, which is no easy feat. Not to mention a gunsmith's installation fees, shipping & handling fees, FFL transfer fees, credit card processing fees, etc.

Unless you have a Para Ordnance 14-45 or Warthog (Double Stack 1911 in .45 ACP), I probably will not entertain any trades.

This is fascinating gun in its compact size, and should you ever decide purchase a tax stamp and apply for a Real Suppressor this model will already accept it with the threaded barrel. So no need to buy a new Barrel for the gun. The Faux Sound Suppressor looks cool on the gun but has no affect on sound and does make the front end top heavy so I didn't shoot with it on very much. I bought this late last November so it is almost a year old and has about 500 rounds through it.

This model features include:
- interchangeable backstrap that creates an ideal fit to the shooters hand
- compact and lightweight design, traditional double action design, 
- ambidextrious controls for right or left handed shooters, 
- integrated trigger lock and loaded chamber indicator, 
- magazine disconnect
- hammer safety and firing pin safety for safe and reliable operation, 
- fixed barrel that is threaded including an adapter and thread protector
-  windage adjustable rear sight and elevation adjustment
-  interchangeable front sights for variations in shooter operations.
