The trigger bar broke out of the box, but it has been repaired and I sent 50+ rounds down the pipe yesterday without one FTF or FTE.  

I want to trade the 738 away for reasons of ergonomics.  When firing the weapon, I could not get comfortable with the grip.  I have large hands that just would not seem to find sufficient purchase on the grip, and I had to constantly be wary of the slide biting my left forefinger.  In short, I think I bought a pistol that was just a bit too small for me.  

As to details: the pistol is gray polymer with a hard chrome slide.  It is chambered in .380 auto, and capacity is 6+1. If you have any other questions about technical details, feel free to email me at REDACTED, or to consult the Taurus website for specs.  I have the following accessories:  1)  both factory mags were outfitted with Pearce grip extensions for Ruger LCP; 2) FOBUS Elite paddle holster (fits really well, draws smoothly); 3)  box of approx. 45 rds of shitty range ammunition.

Because I understand that the fact that the pistol was returned for service might be a turn-off for potential traders, be advised that I will be happy to go to a local range with you and let you fire the pistol to ensure proper function before completing the trade."

model 64, .30WCF. Receiver is freckling, most of blue remains on bb and lever. Wood is in good shape except for an old repair at the wrist. The wrist appears to have been accraglassed where it meets the reciever, probably due to oil soaked wood. Its a very sound repair, and doesn't look bad, but it's not a collector gun either. This one has an old Redfield reciever sight on it thats worth $100 by itself. This rifle is a shooter, not a collector so I'm pricing it as such....$550

I don't have detailed photos up of all of these, but have tried to describe them to the best of my ability.

This action was originally in an aftermarket stock with a scout scope mount- I received it this way, but have re-installed the rear leaf sight. The front sight/bayonet lug was removed entirely by the previous owner and then put back on improperly, but I have all the parts, save for one pin that holds the bayonet lug on and the barrel bands.

Some History: Smith & Wesson had been purchased by a conglomerate named Bangor Punta. In 1970, Bangor Punta also purchased 54% of Taurus. Thus, the two companies became ""sisters"". Smith & Wesson never owned Taurus. They were both independent companies. However, during the next seven years, a great deal of technology and methodology was passed between the two. What may come as a surprise to some is that more of what was ""right"" in Porto Alegre was sent to Springfield than was sent from Springfield to south of the equator.

 The new guns do not have this finish on them and the construction is not as good.

The Tanfoglio Witness pistol is one of the most versatile designs in the industry today. Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery ,providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling.

The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you''ll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol''s bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot.

You can easily convert your Witness steel or polymer frame pistol to shoot .22 LR, 9x 19mm, 10 mm, .38 Super, .40 S&W, or .45 ACP. No matter what your need, one gun can do it all. No other platform gives you the choices, versatility, and value found in the Tanfoglio Witness. Whether you''re a competitive shooter, firearms enthusiast, or armed professional, the Witness product line can fill all your needs. Quality, value, comfort, accuracy and dependability. EAA Witness...No Limit ! European American Armory is proud to be the exclusive importer of Tanfoglio products in the USA.

Stevens Arms & Tool Company's entry into the center fire lever arena. Although some sources claim that there were 26,000 of these guns made, it is more likely that only about 5,000 were made. It was produced (or at least cataloged) from 1911 through 1917 and serialized with at least one other Stevens gun during that period (which accounts for the high production number). It is a unique design, capturing the best features of its competitor’s guns (Winchester and Marlin) at the time. It was tapped on the top of the receiver for a scope or target sight, ejects to the right and is very esthetically pleasing with its 22"" barrel and 2/3 magazine. Apparently sales did not go well which accounts for the relative scarcity of these rifles. 

This gun is in excellent condition for its age. It is chambered for the 35 Remington cartridge. The metal is in exceptional condition with the bluing better than 85% remaining on the receiver and barrel. The magazine tube and forend cap show thinning blue as does the bottom of the receiver from carrying. Overall, the gun is in great condition for its age. There is no box or original paperwork with this gun."

I bought this in place of a different rifle and then the rifle I wanted came available so I'm getting rid of this one. I really wanna keep it, but the wife said, that its gotta go. So my loss is your gain. The condition of this rifle, it is in amazing shape. In my opinion, on a scale of 1 to 10, this rifle is a 9.8. I has a Barksa 4x32 IR scope on it. The crosshairs illuminate red and have 11 different stages of brightness. Comes with 1 factory 10 round magazine. In the 2 days that I have owned this rifle I have shot about 30 rounds through it and the original owner said that he shot 30 rounds through it and I believe it because this gun is awesome. I was drillin' pop cans at about 80 yards with it. Asking $250 O.B.O.

Great starter pistol or for Concealed Carry. I have bought a different CC pistol and no longer need this one. This pistol is in great shape and has already been warranty repaired by Colorado Gun Works. These pistols have a factory problem of a spring jumping out the notch that is suppose to ride in and then fires erractically. CGW has machined the notch a little deeper and then inserted the spring and staked it off. Unlike a lot of other Bersa's out there, this one will now fire reliably when needed. Great pistol, just not needed anymore. Comes is factory box, key for integrated trigger lock, external trigger lock, factory test round, blackhawk holster, and factory magazine. One of the coolest features of this pistol is that fact that it is a Double Action/Single Action pistol with a De-cocker. This means you can breach a bullet into the chamber and then de-cock it. So then if you needed to defend yourself it will take a harder, safer, double action trigger pull to get the first round off. Then every round after that is single action. Love this feature. Alot of your smaller CC pistol are Double Action only, of which is not nearly as accurate as sngle action. Email if you would like to set up a meet to look at this pistol.

fire, but I'd like to hold onto those unless the right trade of offer comes along. 

I am looking for any firearm trade offers or cash offers for my items. I would love any slide action pistol or a ruger .22 revolver.

Thanks for looking and do not hesitate to ask questions!"

This is the caliber the Russians switched to in 1974.  They found it vastly superior to the the 7.62X39, they used to use.  (They never switched back).  

   This caliber extends the effective range by several hundred meters.  It has high velocity, much flatter trajectory, better accuracy, longer range, and almost NO recoil.  It has a reputation as a much better ""stopper"".  Afgan fighters feared it, and called it the ""Poison bullet"".

   Ammo is the cheapest center fire you can by.  (1080 rds in sealed cans for $139.)

   Rifle comes with a side folding, military issue, metal butt stock. (It can be fired with stock folded.)  Tapco trigger is EXCELLENT!  This is the only model that has safety access on BOTH sides of receiver.  You can take off safety with hand still on pistol grip.  Forearm has high quality rails on top, both sides, and bottom.   Red dot, laser, light and vertical grip/bipod can be easily mounted.  Two 30 rd mags included.

I'm interested in either a Ak-47 chambered in 7.62x39, or a 1911 chambered in 45 ACP. I would really prefer a commander size 1911, but as long as it has an ambi-safety I'm fine with it.

I don't have any pics right now, but can certainly take some if anyone is interested.

It is very similar to http://www.rockriverarms.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&category_id=374&CFID=157372956&CFTOKEN=52227494&jsessionid=f030ee7b7fe0211fff73

The only differences are a different muzzle brake and the front sight is a flip-up ARMS mounted to the rail rather than gas block. Near as I can tell it is otherwise identical.

Comes with case, 4 Window P-Mags, 1 20 round polymer mag for benchrest shooting, NcStar 3-9x Illuminated Optic, Blackhawk riser rail, and grip-pod system (real one, not knock-off).

I'm not completely sure of the round count, I would guess somewhere in the 500 range. I am the original owner. I can also sell whoever buys the firearm whatever ammo I have left (not sure, but several hundred) for $5 per box of 20. (Not willing to sell separate, at least not until the gun is gone)

As you can see from the link, this is not a cheap gun. I will need to get about $950 out of it or trade for one of the firearms listed below + cash as appropriate. This has been an a great gun and I hate to part with it, but I can't put in the range time that it so richly deserves."
