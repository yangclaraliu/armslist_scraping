In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

So you tell me what you have to trade or make a cash offer of what it's worth to you. It has a newer string and adjustable sights, a removable quiver for the bolts, if the offer is good enough I will supply some new bolts. With a draw weight of 150 pounds and the short bullpup style stock this great for deer hunting, other game, or just for target shooting.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

As long as you have a normal stamped receiver, this stock will fit (Not an AT-47 and not one of those slanted MAK-90 receivers). You need a NORMAL stamped AKM receiver such as a WASR. By far this is the best folding stock design there is for an AK. It's lightning fast to open and it's rock solid steel with a nice rubber butt pad. I'm selling it for $100 because I barely used it AND I'm including the screws you need to install it, which I had to order from the U.K. for about an additional $15 Then I had to take the time to shorten one up. RTG doesn't sell the screws and good luck finding what metric thread pitch you need. I don't remember how I found them but I did. The block that slides into the receiver and screws into the trunnion doesn't stick out like some of the folding stocks I've seen for sale from K-VAR either. This stock is a really quick way to add some badassery to your stamped receiver rifle and it's ROCK SOLID. No wobble or play in this thing at all."

Purchased by my sister for her commute to work but she moved back to NY due to a family emergency before getting much chance to use it. Only has 46 miles on it.

Black and gray. Electrical start is a little tricky but it will also kick start. No battery.  Tires are brand new as well.  Need to have front cowling reattached.

No title. Should only be considered for parts or a project, which is why it's so inexpensive. 60 mpg.

I'm moving and want it gone. 

I have plenty of firearms but will consider trades.  Would definitely consider trading for a similar value in ammunition .308/7.62x51, (500 rounds) .223/5.56, (1000 rounds) .45ACP (1200 rounds)  .9mm, (2000 rounds)  .303British, .22lr, or 7.62x54R.

293,http://www.armslist.com/posts/547293,"For Sale:  REDUCED .30-40 Krag US carbine, Springfield model 1896","Grey Forest, San Antonio, Texas",$ 250,"Listed On: Monday, September 10, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"offered for sale is this Spanish-American War-era Krag carbine, made for the US Army by Springfield Armory. If you're not already familiar with these weapons, the Wiki page has some good info – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield_Model_1892-99

This weapon probably started out as a rifle, and was modified to suit a civilian use, but it is interesting just as an example of this type of weapon and for some of its features. The side-loading magazine is of particular interest, (believed unique to this model) designed to allow reloading by a soldier in the prone position. The elevation rear sight is also an interesting feature, though I would think that the maximum range of 2000 yards is at least a little optimistic! The muzzle configuration is apparently an attempt to form a sort of muzzle brake or flash suppressor -- I have no idea whether it is effective.

The first picture gives an overall view of the weapon -- about 43½"" long, with a barrel of about 23"". It weighs a hair under 8 pounds empty. There is some pitting evident on the exposed metal; I have not disassembled it to inspect the metal inside the stock. There is no apparent rust. Although the weapon clearly has been shot a good bit (part of the reason I think it's likely seen use in battle), there is good rifling in the bore, and I think it will shoot well. I personally have never loaded or fired this weapon, and as for any 100+-year-old weapon, if you intend to fire it, I would encourage a thorough inspection by a qualified gunsmith, and appropriate caution in loading and operation. The stock has likely been refinished with varnish. It is in overall good condition, but has several scratches and would be improved with a new coat of varnish.

The only marks I can find on the metal (again, without disassembling the weapon) are on the receiver which (as shown in the 2d picture) is marked:

U.S.
MODEL 1896. SPRINGFIELD ARMORY. 558XX

On the left side of the stock below the bolt the underlined letters WI are marked on the stock, under the varnish -- likely the initials of a previous owner or the soldier who carried it.

The weapon is chambered for the .30-40 Krag cartridge. Included in the sale are five rounds of loaded ammunition which I believe to be of modern manufacture, as well as a set of Lee loading dies and 96 new shell casings. The cartridge takes the same .308"" diameter bullets used in many other modern loads, and reloading data is widely available.

I can provide many more pictures if desired, and I'll be happy to answer any questions, or even put it in your hand for a look-see if you're seriously interested in owning it."

Most of the parts are not original to the receiver, but most are still H&K made parts I believe (with a few exceptions). The gun shoots beautifully. It will feed anything you want to put through it.

This gun comes with both the wood furniture and the plastic furniture, for whatever mood you are in. As you can tell, it has a “wide” OD Green hand guard with bipod. Also, it comes with four (4) magazines and a Tapco scope mount. Get this rifle while you still can! Know your local laws before you commit.

The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

Has the crimson trace laser guard installed. Comes with factory magazine with finger extension and flat base plate and a second factory magazine(not a cheap crappy pro-mag). Just put 50 rounds through it today at the range without a hiccup, functioned flawlessly. Brought it home, field stripped, cleaned and lubed it. Originally purchased it for my GF as a carry gun, but she didn't enjoy shooting it, preferred the revolver, I would carry it but I prefer my P-32 to this gun. Also comes with a Blackhawk pocket holster, works well, I carried the gun in this holster a handful of times and it is extremely comfortable and with this holster the gun does not print at all. 

Gun is in great condition, light wear on the outside of the chamber where the slide rubs against it, normal use wear if you are familiar with firearms. Slide shows no wear and is in perfect condition, frame, magazines and laser are in perfect condition. Do not have the original box or paperwork. 

If sold or traded for something that is not a .380 I will throw in 63 rounds of Remington 88gr hollow points.

Must have valid and current AZ Driver's license, not be prohibited from owning a firearm, prefer current CCW. I don't need a copy of anything(no clue why people would expect someone to give a stranger a copy of their driver's license) I just need to see it to verify that you are an AZ resident."

A revolutionary rifle design—the HK SL8-6 is constructed almost entirely of a reinforced carbon-fiber polymer. Based on the combat-proven G36 rifle used by the German Army, the SL8-6 uses a proven short stroke, piston-actuated gas operating system, well known for simplicity and reliability.

Designed and engineered to deliver exceptional shooting performance, the SL8 is a favorite among European target shooters, due in large part to its modular construction and free-floating bull barrel. A short Picatinny rail mount is standard and allows accessory optics to be easily added. Made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process, the SL8-6 barrel ensures accuracy and long life. The ergonomic and clean lines of the H&K SL8-6 are functional and modern, giving the SL8-6 the look and feel of a 21st century firearm.

Only blemishes are on the front sight post where the previous owner removed the ring around the front sight, just needs some blue touch up around the area (can see in pictures).  The receiver has very minor wear, and I have not seen any other Grade 1 BAR's in this condition.  The wood stock/handguard are still basically perfect.  I have checked gunbroker extensively in the last few months and feel this is a fair price as I see them going from 700-900 all the time in worse condition/without scope."

Comes w/nylon holster with mag pouch. (4) 7rd mags and (2) 15rd extended mags.
This is a tough gun made of forged steel!! The Norinco's are forged. If you look at Norinco's up close, you will typically notice some of the machining is rough. This is usually evident in the slide serrations. 5100 series steel means shorter life for cutters and milling bits, but results in probably the strongest 1911 ever built.
Gun is in overall good condition and ready to shoot.
