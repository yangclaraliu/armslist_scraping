Price will go up when it is done.

I am the second owner. The TRP started life as a PB9108L, a milspec SA. The original owner sent this and a Para to SA and had them converted to TRP's. He decided he liked the Para better and sold the SA to me. 

The original owner fired very few rounds through it. I have probably put around 300-500 through it.

No issuses ever, shoots great, best trigger I have ever squeezed and the best checkering I've wrapped my fingers around.

It comes with the case and 2 Shooting Star 8 round magazines. The night sights still light up but I have had this for 8 years now so they may be nearing the end of their usefullness soon.

Asking $1150 ftf within a reasonable distance from Knox or Michigan City. Must have and show your IDL and LTCH. 

Trade interests are Gen4 Glocks 26 or 19, Ruger LCR, Arsenal AK in 7.62, and maybe a quality factory AR15, +/- cash depending on the deal.

It did not come with the original magazine.  Only fired once by me to test functionality and the previous owner assures me that it has never been fired before that.  It has been kept in storage and looks beautiful, like the ones sitting on the shelves at the store.  

Comes with original owners manual, soft case, and 30rd magazine.  

I purchased this weapon for the same price I am asking for.  Low ball offers will not be responded to.  PRICE IS FIRM.  Basically a brand new rifle but 30 dollars cheaper than what retailers are charging.  Please, move along if you cannot honor this.

Illinois only.  Must have valid FOID and willing to sign a bill of sale and provide a photocopied copy of FOID (for my records).  

Pictures available upon request only.

Its a great gun with great reviews everywhere you read, that is why I bought it.  Its a fun gun to shoot.  Easy to clean, slide removes and reinstalls literally in seconds... I wish all pistols were like that.

Each cabinet has a durable laminated top, holes already drilled on the inside for fully adjustable shelf height setting, and comes with shelves. These are not new, but they are perfectly usable and natural woodgrain finish and look nice. There are a couple of the larger ones that will need a few screws or nails to stiffen up the corners. If you have a store and need display shelving, or even just want them to organize the garage or wherever, these will work great and they will hold a lot of weight if you have heavy items that need to be stored on them such as books, tools, ammo, et c.

Comes with 2 holsters (one fobus and one Galco Matrix) and 6+ mags, some beretta and some surplus. Also comes with the original Beretta hard plastic case.

Open to just about any handgun trade if it catches my fancy, got the itch for something different. 

gun laws apply, need to either see a concealed permit, or receive a pistol purchase permit.

Started off as a bone stock SWmp15-22 with the threaded barrell and full polymer rail system. Then I put on a magpull right handed grip, US standard shoulder pad (there is no recoil this just makes it more comfy to shoot in the summer when you have thin shirt on as the texture is pretty heavy) Mounted a sling. The stock is a milspec AR stock with 6 postion colapasbility.

On the internalls I have polished the trigger and droped in a JP trigger weight reduction kit which is basicly a few new springs. Combined with the polished trigger cut the pull weight down to 4 lbs. 

On the buisness end I removed the factory birdcage which will come with it and threaded on a new one that just looks mean. I am also including a barrell shroud suppressor can that can easily thread on as well as I never locked either down so you can play around with it. There is a 240 lumen tactical light with dual settings ON and STROBE attached to a pressure which mounted to the foregrip. Its brighter then hell and to top it off there is a reddot sight with 4 differnt reticles and 7 brightness settings which I find is far easier to maintain zero mounted on the front of the weapon. 

If you know anything about guns you know how much work and money went into this so shoot me an offer. I have fired alot rounds through it and broke it down everytime and I keep it very clean never had a missfire since break in and the 25 round magazine functions flawlessly."

The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used.

Hello Everyone!

I have what I believe is a great deal for someone looking for a backup weapon or a small handgun that they can slip into their pocket but still have some real punch if it’s needed.  This is a VERY lightly used Ruger LCR (Light Compact Revolver) in .38 caliber with Crimson Trace Laser Grips plus extras.

I’ve put less than 50 rounds through the gun; just enough and just often enough to keep me familiar with it. This is a great little revolver and while I don’t really want to part with it, I also know that I just don’t need it and haven’t even carried it in at least a year.  I’ve carried it in my pants pocket and in my briefcase - its only sign of wear at all is a small nick at the top of the frame.

I've included a couple of pics but but I would be happy to text more to anyone who is interested; just contact me with your cell number.

The package includes…

1. The LCR with original box, bag and paperwork
2. Original box and paperwork for the CT Laser Grips.
3. DESANTIS N38 Pocket Holster
4. Crosbreed mini-Tuck IWB holster (I bought used but have never used)
5. A set of Bianchi ammunition strips to hold extra rounds
6. Over $75 worth (80 rounds) of  of .38 Ammo (Magtech practice ammo  [a 50 round box and a partial box of 20]; 20 rounds of Winchester Supreme Elite JHP personal defense ammo and 20 round box of Magtech Guardian Gold JHP personal defense ammo)

I’m asking $700 for the entire package.

I'd prefer to sell this as a complete package but if you are only interested in the package sans CT Laser Grips, contact me and we'll work out a price.

Not interested in any trades at this time - I'm trying to trim down my collection.

FTF transfer only.  I prefer to sell to an HCP holder but will sell to non-HCP holder using a standard Firearms Transfer form.  I live in Middle Tennessee but willing to meet you half-way anywhere in the state.

If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to ask.

Thanks for looking!

Update: This is one badass rifle.  I've owned many an SKS C&R, AK, AR-15, and Mini-14 rifles and have never had anything shoot this accurate.  When a blind fat ass fuck like myself can hit a pumpkin head from that far away something is right about the rifle.  It's like pistols.  At 50 yards I can hardly hit shit with a pistol unless it's an XD or XDM then I'm dead on.  My days of caliber hopping are over; the sks is my friend along with 9ms federal ammo.  If Nibiru is true then I'll have fun shooting my Norinco at it when it descends.  Seriously, a 1993 NIB Norinco is classic because of the ban and now I know why.  It is because they were so accurate.  Anyway folks, bend over and kiss your asses goodbye!  The End Times are here, FEMA camps are coming, just like in Jordan and all our firearms will shortly be confiscated.  Yup, no more ammo and guns!  This ain't the Middle East folks, it's the Mid-West!  It's about to explode.  Shortly Iran will nuke Israel and the US.  I've heard the argument a million times that if a nation nukes the US then that nation will no longer exist.  The rulers of Iran are spread out across the world and will live on; unfortunately, Christian Americans will be radiated while the Islamic caliphate reigns.  If a Man's FOID is taken then that man will learn other methods of self-defense with a 1000-fold kill ratio.  It's the nature of the Beast!  Seriously though, according to news reports it does seem like the End Times are here.  *wink* *wink*.  If SHTF and the rulers go into their bunkers I hope they realize that those of us who didn't have bunkers will no longer allow them to lead.

Extremely accurate out at 100 yards.  Excellent mechanical condition and good overall condition.  Purchased new in 1993 and was fired for the first time on 8-30-2012 with 50 rounds put through it.  Bayonet was removed in 1993 by the importer so there is no bayonet.  Interested only in trades."

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

A sitcom behemoth of the last 10 years, Friends shot out of the gate in 1994 with snappy writing and an attractive cast. The exploits of sensitive paleontologist Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), his obsessive-compulsive sister Monica Geller (Courteney Cox); Monica's roommate Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), a spoiled rich girl trying to live on her own; earthy aromatherapist/masseuse Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow); and Monica's neighbors across the hall-- sarcastic Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) and his dim-bulb roommate Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) became a nationwide obsession, a pop-culture icon (remember ""The Rachel"" haircut?) and a top Nielsen hit for its entire run.

The 1911 RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS comes from the SIG SAUER Customs Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which SIG SAUER gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. The RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), and checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom Rosewood grips. This two-tone 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistol features a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slide and frame are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.

It has less than 100 rounds fired through it. It comes with approx 300 rounds (the good stuff, new brass not reloades, boxer primed, FMJ), a pelican case, a factory bipod and a 40X illuminated scope, (nothing too fancy, a $200 Hammers). The ammo alone is worth $1300. There is nothing wrong with the gun at all, the only reason I am selling it is because of money reasons, I cant accept any trades for this, as I just am looking for the money. I previosly listed this for $4000, but have dropped it down to $3850, This price is firm and the best I can do, as I have almost $6000 into everything. Thanks for looking!"
