Mags vary in condition,A couple have brown tape residue on them from most likely being taped together at one time which can easily be cleaned off with solvent. A couple have rust. The 30rd mag looks the best out of all. All have spring tension so i assume all work.

I do not have a 30-caliber rifle and this came in a lot of magazines i bought from an estate sale. The dealers at the gun show i went to last weekend were selling the 15rd mags for $15.00-$18.00 each. I think i have these priced pretty fairly so i will stick with that price for now.

 The 911 designation isn’t for the emergency call, it’s to remind its user of the enemy we face, the war we fight, and the heroes who fight it! With the subdued 9/11 Tribute limited edition nomenclature on it’s blade, the operator carries with him a visible reminder of the Americans lost and the heroic efforts of those who take arms in defense of liberty. Blade design offers a combination spear/tanto point with the best attributes of both. CTV2™ steel, an intimidating blade length in excess of eight inches, hollow grind and v-chisel sharpened edge make the Interceptor 911 an incredibly effective fighting tool. The Interceptor 911 E&E offers further enhancements for real-time escape and evasion activities. It includes a patent pending Splitter Hilt™ which provides for cutting away harnesses and overhead cables. Backsaw is optimized for cutting through plexiglass aircraft canopies or helo windows. The choil-notch doubles as both a bottle opener and peacemaker-its’ deployment and use is a great bar fight deterrent in exotic third world locales. Extended serrations aid underwater cutting efforts. Hilt ports provide additional attachment points for paracord in survival situations. Window-breaker in pommel. Notch design allows prybar style mechanical advantage for entry through aluminum vehicle rooftops. Expander tip provides expanded entry-wound channel. Like all Dark Ops blades, the CTV2™ steel will last for decades! The most advanced fixed blade fighter in service today. 100% made in America! Black Titanium CarboNitride (TiCN) vacuum deposited finish.

 Bearing the namesake and call sign of legendary Navy SEAL Paul Basal, this knife is the new choice of operational warriors throughout the globe! Designed by Basal with the Dark Ops design chief, it features all the critical items for a Modern Spec-Ops knife. The Shadow offers an extended blade length for penetrating Comm-bloc frag vests with an accelerated spear point tip and sharpened foretip for maximum penetration. The top edge features a bone breaker and a radical, self-cleaning BlastRip™ saw for carving survival notches in spears and anchoring notches for detonation cord. A pat pend. BarbSnap™ cutter allows for rapid notching and snapping of interdiction wires in entry ops. An abbreviated top-hilt/bottle opener works with a new serrated palmstop, allowing for a reverse grip with an astonishing six linear inches of surface area! The Shadow features a corrosion resistant finish designed to take the saltwater immersion often involved in SEAL operations. The handle is made of a low-durometer, high tensile aramid composite that is impervious to everything from aviation fuel to Al Qaeda body fluids. The handle is thinner and wider for greater mechanical advantage with deep finger grooves orienting the blade axis of the knife in the hand and dramatically increasing effective grip surface. A prominent WhipLok™ finger notch provides an axis point for hacking as well as 200 degrees of grip area, ideal with wet hands or when using gloves. The handles are field replaceable to blend with woodland, desert or black camo schemes. Quartz impregnated inserts provide extreme circumstances grip enhancement and are replaceable should decontamination be required. The Basal Shadow utilizes the same CTV2™ Blade Steel and CryoHardening techniques as the StratoFighter™ Folders! The hilts do not protrude forward effectively reducing the length of the blade. Hollow grinding lends to greater cutting and slashing effectiveness. Deep blood grooves keep the weight of the full .250 inch thick blade properly balanced in the hand. The black Titanium CarboNitride (TiCN) vacuum deposited finish is designed to shed the micro-fine airborne sand of Middle-Eastern deserts.

Magpul PRS The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR10/SR25 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock especially designed for the longer charging handle throw of 7.62 NATO platforms. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock.

Nightforce 5.5x22x50 Riflescope Originally developed for the U.S. military’s extreme long range shooting and hard target interdiction, both 5.5-22 Nightforce NXS models provide a broad magnification range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. These characteristics, combined with the extreme ruggedness and reliability of every Nightforce riflescope, make them ideal for even the largest calibers. The slim profile of the 5.5-22 x 50 NXS makes it easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems. Its superb resolution at high magnification opens an entirely new world of extended range shooting for the accomplished marksman; Nightforce shooters are now accurately reaching to 2000 yards and beyond.

Hand cannon, it's a magnum shoots .45, 410GA (yes the shotgun shell), and the massive 454 Casull. You can even load 2 of each bullet type in the 6 revolver chamber.
There's nothing in North America this can't take down.
Not even a year old, used as protection from grizzly bears in Alaska, shot maybe twice.

My department does not allow .45 ACP to be used because it is to big a caliber. I prefer the 9mm because that is what my department issues. I am interested in Glock, M&P, Springfield XD, and Ruger SR9 pistols primarily. Ruger SR9 is last resort because it is so hard to find a duty holster that is light bearing. I need extra magazines and possibly a duty holster for the gun. Night sights are okay but not mandatory. My department is ""pro-weapon mounted light"" as am I, so it is imperative that the handgun has a rail so I can mount my TLR-1s.

One of the rifles is the converted shorter model. I am asking $360 for all three. I have seen models in working condition priced at around $375 each. I have included a description from ""World Guns"" below.


The Steyr M1895 rifle, also known as Steyr-Mannlicher M95 straight pull rifle, was developed by famous Austrian arms designer Ferdinand Ritter Von Mannlicher. Based on his previous M1890 design, this rifle was manufactured in Austro-Hungarian Empire at state arms factories in Steyr (Austria) and Budapest (Hungary). More than 3 millions of M95 rifles were produced between 1895 and 1918. This rifle was issued to Austro-Hungarian army, and, after the fall of the Empire, to the Austrian and Hungarian armies. Originally produced in 8x50R caliber, in 1924 some of M95 rifles were converted to the German 7.92x57 Mauser (also known as 8x57 Mauser) ammunition. These converted rifles featured shorter 58 cm barrels, were designated as M95/24 and used in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. This conversion gave away with original Mannlicher en bloc clip, and replaced it with Mauser stripper clips. Since 1930 Austria converted most of the M95 rifles to the more powerful 8x56R M30 ammunition, using the same Mannlicher en bloc clips. These rifles were designated as M95/30, and marked with the letter ""S"" on the receiver ring. Hungary started to convert their rifles to the same 8x56R ammunition in 1931, with the upgraded rifles being marked with the letter ""H"" on the receiver ring. Many of the M95 rifles were used during the Word War 2 by the Hungarian, Bulgarian and Italian armies, as well as by some German police forces."

Parts thats were changed to be compliant are: tapco trigger group,tapco piston, and pistol grip, also has the AK47 gas tube and a new retainer for the tube which is the only way to put wood on it, has reat ak wood from hungry that my parants sent over to me. The but does have the trap door for cleaning kit which is in their. Alao comes with 5 metal 30 rd mags from the gaili(sp) and 1 bakelite30 rd mag. They all fit and work the bakelite is ok but wobbles. The 5 metal mags fit nice and that's what I use.Shot maybe 400 rds threw it. I do have a stiffer spring for it that u can have but i don't use it. And also has a bullet guide in so the rds actually go in the barrel and not jam. Wood looks rough but that's how they bought it and i wasn't gonna sand it. Love the look of it this way 
I will be willing to drive  a few hrs but would.love too meet halfway or at a range

And i have the factory 10rd mag also.
This will shoot both .223 and 5.56nato steel and brass. Loves the NATO stuff

You can bring your own pistol for the shooting portion along with 50 rounds of ammunition. I recommend using a .22 however any caliber is accepted. If you don't have a pistol yet or would just like to borrow mine I have a .22 Ruger.

Shoot me offers. This gun needs paint/coatings. The finish is worn and there is a little bit of rust pitting on the receiver. However, the function of this gun is perfect. It has never failed, never had an issue, fired about 500 rounds through it. Don't know how many rounds have gone through it in total. It is 922r compliant (a lot of them you find like this are NOT compliant). I am only seeing if I can get rid of it, not needing to and if I don't, I don't care. Do NOT low ball me. Standard MAK-90's run for $550 (poor original condition) to well over $1000. I am asking $900 obo. Trades are really what I am interested in though. Trades plus cash work just as well. 

Comes with 7 mags, few extra parts, Bushnell red dot and as many original parts as I could salvage. Contact with questions. Trade value must be $1100 plus. Your P95 is not WORTH the $350 you gave for it brand new a year ago now that it has 500 rounds through it. Your AR with 2000 rounds is NOT worth the $1000 you dropped on it two months ago before your course, however, if you have the right AR (i.e. good quality to include DPMS, Spikes, BCM, etc) then we can trade straight across or I may be able to sweeten the deal for you. If you have an optic, don't expect me to count it as retail, I won't. I'll let you keep it for more than about 30% of original cost because I can get them cheap brand new, no offense intended.

If you think I'm stark raving mad but would like to make an offer from where you're sitting, drop me a line, I'm not a mean guy."

Gun has had a custom stippling job dont on the grip area to help with better gripping due to the small size.

The second gun is a basically brand new KelTec PF9.Gun is in pristine condition and has only had 1 box of ammo through her, 50 rds. Has a brand new stainless guide rod, replaced the platic one cause I did not trust it. Also has apolisted barrel and feed ramp to help with feeding any and all ammo you put through her. Comes with 2 brand new belt clips and hardware so you dont need a holster if you dont want. Also comes with 3 mags with pinky extensions, box, paperwork, a king tuk iwb holster, and new orange sites installed plus originals.

Looking to sell them for $325 each or willing to do some trading. Really looking to get my hands on a Springfield Armory XDs single stack .45 but will consider subcompact XD's also. Also like rifles in .225/5.56, 30-06, .308, but am open to others. Would also consider shotguns. Pretty much just let me know what you have.

This specimen has been bead blasted down to its gray metal, but with some rust appearing forward of the trigger guard. Residual surface pitting is extensive, as the photos show. We rate this M&P as only fair / refinish, since about 30 percent of its surfaces show light to moderate pitting. Mechanical condition is similar: bore and cylinder chambers are affected by very light pitting. Timing, action and lockup are quite good, but there is about 3mm of lateral play to the cylinder, and that part has pronounced endshake. Note that the grips are good, no cracks, and they appear to be original. There are some mechanical; problems with this gun and it will need to be gone over by a competent gunsmith to insure that this gun is safe. Once fixed it should be a nice shooter and to have around the house for protection."

Here is an excerpt from Jeff Quinn of Gunblast.com:

The EAA Witness is a fine pistol, available in many different configurations, and chambered for our most popular pistol cartridges, plus the excellent but less popular 38 Super and 10mm Auto cartridges. The EAA Witness is a world-class fighting pistol, and I highly recommend it.

THAT'S $100. LESS THAN I PAID FOR IT, AND YOU GET AN ADDITIONAL PAIR OF UPGRADED GRIPS PLUS A FULL BOX OF AMMO!
FOR SALE. Brand new unfired in the box with all accessories, Taurus PT-100 Stainless .40 S&W Caliber pistol with accessory rail. Although it currently has genuine Taurus Pealite Grips on the handles, it came with the black hard rubber grips which are included in the box. The Taurus Pearlite Grips are really beautiful, with a deep dimensional swirl which rivals natural pearl in it's appearance. The included black hard rubber grips are nicely checkered with the Taurus logo, and provide a firmer hold for extended range practice and competition. Depending on your mood, you can change out the grips in about 2 minutes. 
The PT-100 is based on the time proven Model 92 platform which has been constantly improved and upgraded over the years resulting in the 9mm sidearm currently carried by the US military. In fact, many handgunners consider the Taurus to be an improvement over the military issue due to the placement of the hammer drop safety on the frame instead of the slide. The .40 caliber chambering is one of the standards of law enforcement now, similar in stopping power to the venerable .45 ACP.
A Taurus favorite, the PT100 makes a return appearance equipped as a large frame pistol in a popular police caliber. Featuring an ambidextrous three position safety that allows cocked and locked single action carry or the convenience of a de-cocked double action.

I got this pistol about 2 months ago and it has remained unfired in it's original box with accessories since that time. Unfortunately, due to medical reasons I have to sell it to pay some bills. I paid $599. for it at Gander Mountain  (you can look it up on their web site) but am willing to take a hit on it ($499. OBO). Also, you will not have to pay sales tax ($36.), and the pearlite grips were about $60., and a new box of ammo I got with it was $24., so you will be getting about $220. off of what I have into it. And since Taurus has a lifetime warrantee for any owner, so your coverage is the same as if you had bought it in the store.
Face to face sale cash only, buyer must have Florida Drivers License and be allowed to own a handgun in Florida. If I don't respond to your first email, please try again, as I sometimes accidently delete emails along  with the spam we all get."

The back lens cap though is held on by a paperclip and not the original metal piece, but that doesn't really matter. Comes with original packaging as well.

The back lens cap though is held on by a paperclip and not the original metal piece, but that doesn't really matter. Comes with original packaging as well.

For partial trade, (depending on the offer) I have a New England Wildlife Commemorative Cammo 10 Gauge Turkey Gun, single shot, breech-load, screw-in choke, all drilled and tapped, all set for optics etc. in GREAT condition, slight blemish in top front of butt stock where stock meets receiver. This is a turkey hunter's field gun, not just some safe queen. Had it out twice with only a few shells through it. Comes with matching sling and about 10 rounds of ammo. Can throw in the lockable plastic hard case for the right deal. Asking $200 in trade value. Can add some cash to even out the deal from my end, within reason. Your used Citadel isn't worth $500 unless it has some good extras, sorry."

It has a low round count and the cleaning kit is still in the butt stock.  The particular sks is from factory 26 which is one of the best and well known factories.  The barel length on a paratrooper is only 16 inches which is much shorter than rugular sks's and these shorter versions are much harder to find.  It has a milled trigger group which ive personally not seen on any sks's that ive came across.   

The only thing holding this rifle back from being considered in excellent condition is a small amount of light pitting below the wood line on the reciever.  This pitting is only cosmetic and will not hinder the rifles performance.  It has been reblued over by the previous owner."

For those of you not familiar with these, its a Clone of the Beretta 92 series. This gun is identical almost every way to a Beretta 92 except it has a frame mounted Saftey/Decocker. If you like 1911's its set up the same way except the safty also acts as the decocker if depressed to its second notch. You can run this gun cocked and locked like a 1911 or in double action only like a Beretta. Its been totally reliable for me with anything its been fed and is more accurate than im able to shoot it. The only reason im trading it is that i just purchased a Beretta 92fs.

I'd prefer to do straight trade for a entry level 1911 (ATI, Rock Island, Auto ordnance) I'm also interested in other handguns....glocks...xd.....S&W...colt. I'm in the market for a Keltec Sub 2000. I have cash to add if needed. I may be interested in long guns but it just depends on what you have....so just let me know what you have?"
