I am looking at trading my Howa 1500 in .30-06 for a bolt action rifle in .308.  My Howa 1500 currently has a Nikko Stirling GameKing 3.5-10x44 scope with illuminated reticles mounted on it.  I would be willing to just trade the rifle without the scope or the rifle with the scope, but if you want the scope I would like to get a scope mounted rifle in trade.  I would also consider a trade for an Over-Under 12 gauge shotgun.

The rifle is only 2 or 3 years old and has only seen about 100 rounds.  Basically just sighted it in and did a little target practice.  In like new condition.

Gun has bipod and scope mount and fact cleaning kit and 22 stripper clips with over 510 rounds of ammo that will go with the gun. YOU WILL SIGN BILL OF SALE AND BE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR NO GO. Bullets alone where selling for 1$ each at the gun show and there sold out. I will split the two up but you have to make a resonable offer. SKS's sold for 700-800 at the show and they also are all sold out. Mine is nicer then what they had for sale. If you think my asking price is to much sorry. I feal with current times its more then fair. 

Cant keep up with all the emails. I will call back phone numbers first. Thanks 
To John I will still honor our deal on your 357 and cash If you call but I cant keep waiting.You said 10 its now 1. I would like to move this item so I can invest in other things.

I am a local Colorado Springs artist. I have been doing this type of art for over 8 years. I am able to do almost any image. I can leave it black and white or color it. I can also do a piece of art in a few different sizes. I can do a custom picture for you, as long as you have a print I can use for reference. I never copy pictures. this means you will have a 100% original picture. I have two pictures that I am selling as of right now. They won second and third place In a people's choice art show. The elephant and the snow leopard. The tiger I did for a friend and is not for sale. I can however do another picture close to it. Thanks for looking. Jeff"

 “The Marlin Model 60 and the Glenfield Model 60 are essentially the same, mechanically! The Glenfield line is/was Marlin's economy line, where they could retain the marketshare that would be generated by the consumer that could not afford the top of the line Marlin. 

Basically, all Marlins and Glenfields are mechanically identical. The major difference is/was that the Marlins had walnut stocks, and ""cut checkering"" (where offered), and the Glenfield's had hardwood stocks with walnut finish and ""pressed checkering""!”"

For those of you who haven't then you should know that every news channel and talk show this morning has been a parade of republicans and democrats saying that there is no chance of a gun or even a magazine ban in this congress.  

Colin Powell was even on one saying no chance.  Joel Manchin dem. senator from WVA who just said 2 weeks ago that he would support a ban even though he is in NRA, flipped this morning and said he would not support any ban.

Joe Biden even admitted there was overwhelming support in the senate for NO new bans.

Most people in the business that I have talked to are telling me that in 3 months or so they will be restocked with AR's and magazines at their normal prices.  If you paid 1500 for a 500 dollar M&P sport, or 1800 for a 600 dollar AR, or  50 bucks for a 13 dollar pmag sorry you got ripped off.  

That said if you can get somebody to pay you 2000 for a 600 rifle then go for it, its a free market, but please quit posting things like:  ""get em while you can"" or ""the ban is coming"" when it is not."

Specs:

The XD-S is a single-stack compact pistol chambered in .45ACP.  The overall length is 6.3” with a slim width of only 1”.  Empty weight is a light 21.5 ounces, partially due to its light polymer frame construction.  Standard capacity is 5+1 rounds.  A new and welcome addition to the XD-S pistol is the red fiber

Caliber:

One of the most exciting features of the XD-S is the fact that it was designed around the .45ACP cartridge, which is arguably one of the best self-defense rounds available.

XD-S Features:

The XD-S is equipped with the Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System which is designed to prevent accidental discharges due to dropping or bumping the gun.  The trigger will not operate unless direct rearward pressure is applied to the face of the trigger.

All XD series pistols include a grip safety which only allows firing when the grip safety is depressed.

What’s In the Box?

Springfield Armory has always done an outstanding job of equipping the XD series pistols with most of the accessories needed to get started.  The XD-S is no exception to this rule.  The XD-S comes complete in a high quality storage case suitable for air travel. Contained within you will find a paddle holster, a double magazine pouch, a cable lock, two extra fiber optics (one red, one green), an interchangeable back strap, and  two 5 round magazines."

Never fired. Bought it in november. Comes with 250 rounds of FMJ ammo. When these new gun laws pass where a handgun can not be more than 10 rounds, The price of this gun will skyrocket. Also have a limited edition white ps vita with a clear protective case, and assassin's creed, with a 32gb vita memory card ($100 by itself). i can throw in for the right deal. MUST BE WILLING TO MEET UP IN GREEN BAY.
