If you have a ""wall hanger"" or one that isn't worth fixing I can use it to repair other shotguns. We'll treat this transaction as a PARTS DEAL.
 If you have one - or several - that are just too Ugly or Nasty to have around your nice guns, give me a call. 
If I were a doctor (No, I'm not.), you would say that I am a transplant specialist. I'll transplant a working part of your Parts Gun and replace a worn or missing part of another gun giving the patient new life! Gosh, that makes me feel good all over - and I'm not even wearing a mask or surgical gloves.
Just so that you know: I'm not a felon, a gangster or some undesirable, I have a carry permit so you know I've been screened. I'm a 70-year old retired Marine and this is my hobby.

Low-profile forward grip/hand stop takes advantage of natural body mechanics to give the shooter more precise control, faster pointing, and less operator fatigue. The Magpul AFG (Angled Fore-Grip) positions the support hand close to the centerline of the bore for maximum recoil control to aid in fast, accurate follow-up shots. Provides a consistent reference point for finding the correct hand position quickly when mounting the weapon under stress. The natural, ergonomic hand position with the palm facing up results in better blood flow than the clenched fist stance often used with vertical grips that leads to fatigue and loss of sensation during long periods in the ready position. Improves on the ?thumb break? hold often used with standard vertical grips by allowing the thumb to rest comfortably alongside the top rail, pointing forward, with the rest of the hand in full contact with the forend. Heavy-duty reinforced molded polymer construction stands up to the hard knocks of tactical operations, and deep, molded-in grooves help you maintain a firm grip even with wet hands. Interchangeable inserts give the choice of a straight, uninterrupted gripping surface or one with a convenient ledge to support the index finger. Slides over any Picatinny-style rail and locks securely in place with a hardened steel crossbolt. The AFG may be installed on tactical shotguns and other rifles with railed forends and won't interfere with insertion and removal of magazines on AK-47s."

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

The highest anti-pressure strength of crushed material is 320MPa. It is widely used in mining, metallurgy, construction, highway, railroad, and chemistry industries and etc. Many models are available according to your different fineness requirements.  
Main structure of Jaw Crusher:
Jaw Crusher mainly consists of main frame, eccentric shaft, belt wheel, flying wheel, movable jaw plate, side board, toggle plate, back seat for toggle plate; gap adjusting screw, returning spring, fixed jaw plate, movable jaw plate and so on. The toggle plate also plays the role of protecting.
Working Principle of Jaw Crusher:
Motor drives belt and belt pulley, makes moving jaw up and down through eccentric shaft. When the moving jaw is up, the angle between lining plate and moving jaw becomes large, and this will push moving jaw plate close to the fixed jaw plate. During this process, the material is crushed and ground, thus the crushing will be done. When the moving jaw is down, the angle between lining plate and moving jaw becomes small, the moving jaw plate will leave the fixed jaw plate on account of the effect of pulling bar and spring, and then the crushed material will be discharged from the lower opening of the crushing room. With the motor continuously rotating and the material periodically crushed and discharged by the crusher, the mass production can be realized."

1943 Colt Commercial military 1911A1 S/N 8615XX as described and explained in Both Charles Clawson’s “Collector’s guide to Colt .45 service pistols” and J.C. Harrison’s “U.S. Pistols & Revolvers 1909-1944”. For the avid 1911A1 collector, you know that this is a rare piece as described in Clawson’s book: Beginning in October 1942, the acute need for pistols prompted Colt to transfer 6,575 unsold commercial Government Model automatic pistols to their existing military contract. The existing commercial serial numbers were peened flat on the receiver and under the slide firing pin stop and restamped/renumbered in the military serial number range. All or most of these pistols were originally manufactured wit the Swartz safety. These safeties were removed when the pistol was transferred to the military contract and these “Swartz safety” pistols can be easily identified by a square hole located beside the disconnector cutout in the slide (THIS IS one) Slides retained the original commercial inscriptions . Barrels transferred with these pistols were either “S” (commercial) or “G” (standard military)…(This one contains a “G” barrel - The pistols were parkerized and submitted to Ordnance inspectors for military acceptance. An Ordnance inspection mark (crossed cannons) was stamped on the receivers  W.B. inspectors initials were stamped on a few pistols through S/N 861000 and G.H.D. initials on all others (THIS RECEIVER IS G.H.D. STAMPED – . This particular pistol is in excellent condition inside and out ! Barrel rifling is clear, crisp and shiny"

Please if you do not want this gun do not waste your time and mine. I have had 4 guys try to low ball and say yes ill take it at advertised price. It is priced to sell not give away. It is 75 to 100 below gun shop price. Sorry to offend but a offer of 375 is a joke if I could by them at that I would have a few.

Here we have my rare 6 digit 294xxx 1967 Remington 700 30-06. Verified by Remington on the phone and stampings on barrel are correct. It is the more desirable BDL with hinged floorplate. It also has the decorative ebony forend and ebony pistol grip end on the factory decorative walnut stock. The butt plate is the metal 2 screw. Nice condition especially considering its age. Shoots great tight groups and has nice rifling. Took it to my Remington certified pro armorer today and he said it was good to go and was impressed. It was very windy but we proceeded anyway. First he put 2 in the center at 30yds just for reference before we hopped in the truck, then he shot 3 shots at 350 yds still in bad wind. 2 shots half inch apart and the 3rd about 4 inches away. Even with the bad wind, I was impressed as he was. We were using 180 grain Remington Core-lokt so it was not the high dollar stuff nor the best selection. The Bushnell Elite 3200 scope Is 3x9x40 I believe. It is adjustable and works perfectly and smooth. The rifle has an old school leather sling that has brass rivets and looks great and period correct on the rifle. Rifle bolt action and ejection is great, even at low speeds. You do not have to be rough with it. This is not a desperation sale. 895obo. Please email any questions or offers. I may even consider trades(or a couple of them if needed) but would rather sell. Here is some more about the scope. I will even include a little ammo, God bless.

This scarce variation is found in the approximate serial range 339,000 to 342,000, after which the numbers were moved to the right side and continued that way through the end of production. Overall condition is very good with some strong case colors visible on the frame and quite a bit of blue finish remaining in the protected areas. The grips are in very good shape, without cracks or chips, but do not number to this revolver. Excellent mechanical condition. Very good bore with strong, sharp rifling and mostly bright with a few dark spots but no deep pitting."

It doesn't have any weights to move around or fluids to leak out, it's 100% maintenance free! 

It weighs in at 4.3oz. (Depending on the density and size of the HDTP, the weight can vary slightly.) 

It's CNC machined from Solid Billet Aluminum Bar Stock, Not Casted then Machined like all the Yellowish/Goldish buffers on the Market. 

It's Anodized Matte Black and Laser engraved with our Logo. 

So you're probably wondering what's inside to make this thing so great and different? 

Each buffer is filled with HDTP ""High Density Tungsten Powder"" so there is No reciprocating weights inside to make a lot of noise. It also makes for a Very Smooth cycling rifle.  It eliminates the chance of bolt bounce and muzzle rise in full-auto. It also cuts down on Felt Recoil.  It's a HUGE upgrade from a Standard Carbine buffer!  It's designed for .223/5.56 but it works in all Calibers! 

After its filled with HDTP it's topped off with a mil spec bumper! 


That came from Spikes page. I have 2 of these and only need one. Great buffer here."

I am an NRA instructor and will bring your training certificate for the CCW to the class.

No hidden range or park fees.

Outdoor range allows shooting from holster, shooting while moving and rapid fire and the use of steel and clay targets.

If you need I have pistols and revolves for the class at no extra cost.

I can do private classes one on one for $200 or $150 each for two.  Three or more are still $100 but on your schedule.  The private and semi private classes cover more material than the normal classes because of the amount of one on one.

We also have a 500 yard rifle range.  You can also step back and shoot your pistol at 100, 200 yards or more.  You will be surprised at how accurate they can be.

It is in a like new condition.

The AS trigger system of the Walther P99 has three possible carry modes:

AS Mode
The first is the AS mode which will automatically engage after a round is chambered. The trigger is fully forward, as if in double action, but the striker indicator is to the rear and visible. This mode offers the safety of carrying the P99 AS in single action with a light yet long trigger pull.

DA Mode
The second mode is Double Action. After a round is chambered, the decocking button can be depressed, releasing the striker into a double action trigger pull. In this mode the trigger is fully forward and the striker is at rest and no longer visible to the rear of the slide. After the trigger is first pulled, all subsequent shots will be in single action. This mode is considered, among fellow P99 AS owners, to be the safest mode to carry the AS in. 

SA Mode
The third mode of carry for the P99 AS is Single Action. This mode can be achieved by chambering a round into the AS mode, then slowly pulling the trigger to the rear until you hear the SA portion of the sear engage. There will be an audio able click and the trigger will remain in the rear position. This mode will also automatically engage after the first trigger pull in double action mode.


I have the original plastic box, manual, and both of the extra back straps.


The barrel and slide have been hardness treated in the same manner that Glock has been, but Walther calls it by another trade name than Tennifer. 


I would like to trade for Walther P99C.

From Ruger's web site, it appears the gun was made in 1977, however it has a 1976 Bicentennial barrel.  So I can only assume that the gun has been rebarreled.  Ruger discontinued the 4 5/8"" stainless barrel in 1976, and evidently somebody wanted what was no longer available.  Somebody also appears to have wanted a reed ramp where there was not one, and painted the front sight ramp.  A good portion of it has been cleaned or worn off, but some remains.  The gun comes with a gray hard plastic case and not the original box which I'm guessing was cardboard.  It's a good clean gun, but not mint."
