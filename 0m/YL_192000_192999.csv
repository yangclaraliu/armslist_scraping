It includes an extra folding stock that was only on the rifle for a day, the L.O.P. is about 2 inches longer than with the standard stock and I didnt like the feel. The mag in the rifle is a Galil Orlite 35rnd and it includes a tapco Galil 30rnd (the rifle takes Galil mags) and the factory 10rnd mag. Bullet guide is installed to make the galil mags work. This gun shoots perfect as you would expect from a high end AK, feels a lot different than a AR, has a good amount more recoil because of the lack of a recoil buffer system. Includes a tri-rail dust cover to mount optics NIB but I just use the irons when I shoot this gun, I like the clean look.

Looking for cash OR partial trades- Need a high quality AR BCG, Also interested in sub-compact Glock either G26 or G27 plus cash or G29 as a straight trade.

NO JUNK! This isnt a WASR10 / type 56 POS, this is a high quality Russian rifle. For you Sons of Guns / Red Jacket fans Saiga conversions are their main source of business if that tells you anything about quality, 95% of the time when they deal with an AK on that show its a Saiga, the 1000 yard AK, the internal suppressed AK, all of their custom short barrel shot guns / SBR's- all Saigas originally.
Made at Izhmash, the very factory that first produced the AK47 when Kalashnikov first invented them.

More pics available via email but no pic collectors, I'm happy to email a serious buyer more pics but dont waist my time. You may be able to go out and buy a Saiga for about $450 new locally and a little less online but not converted back to true AK layout and not 992 compliant and not with easy to acquire hi-cap mags and not without paperwork..."

Bar none, it's the brightest scope in the world. Boasting 95% light transmission at 550nm, this is our top-of-the-line riflescope. Our exclusive, hydrophobic Rainguard lens coating - which disperses condensation into microscopic specks, allowing you to literally see around the moisture - ensures you won't miss that trophy buck because you breathed on your eyepiece or you couldn't wipe the rain away in time. All optical lens surfaces are fully multi-coated for the absolute maximum light transmission and the sharpest image. Fingertip, audible/resettable 1/4 M.O.A. adjustments make windage and elevation tuning quick and easy. The ultra-strong one-piece tube is hammer-forged from an aluminum and titanium alloy for 30% more strength than standard aluminum scopes -and to be sure it lasts, it is recoil-tested to 10,000 rounds of a .375 H&H Magnum! Finally, our Elite 4200 scopes offer some of the largest magnification ranges in the industry for optimum versatility in the most challenging hunting situations. In the world of big game pursuit, there are hunters - and there are serious hunters. If you consider yourself the latter, the Elite 4200 is the scope that does justice to your commitment."

Comes with 5 position M4 style stock with recoil pad, SAW grip, Galil handguard, A2 muzzle brake (does a lot to flatten recoil), quick detach rail, iron sight adjustment tool, and for free I'm throwing in a basic red dot.

All have been tested and work no problem. Steel mags were disassembled and cleaned with mineral spirits and a rag on purchase so they're dirt free.

Accepts all magazines that fit the AR-15 series weapons."

Light as a feather. The 625 Series is one of the best selling Citori over and under shotgun lines ever. With this high level of success some gun companies would just sit back and keep selling the same basic product. Not Browning. The Feather 625 field guns couple the 625 Field with our popular Feather Technology to make an over under shotgun already regarded as the best looking and finest handling -- even lighter and faster than ever before. Feather Technology replaces the steel receiver with an ultra lightweight alloy model that provides more than a full pound of weight reduction. Of course, lighter weight doesn't mean light duty.  Even with the alloy receiver, the strength and longevity of your Citori 625 Feather are not compromised. The Feather shotguns rely on a solid steel dovetailed breech face and steel hinge pin, both areas of high wear on an over and under, to take the brunt of the forces that act on these critical components.
With their reduced mass, 12 gauge 625 Feather models weigh about the same as a 20 gauge Citori, but with the advantages of faster handling and pointing, and a larger shot payload. This weight reduction also means a Citori 625 Feather is much easier to carry during a long day in the field. Shoulder a Citori 625 Feather and understand for yourself how a little less can actually be so much more.
If your looking for a lightweight, upland hunting over and under shotgun to carry all day long in the field hunting for doves, grouse, quail, chukar or pheasants (what have we missed? Perhaps Hungarian partridge and snipe) look no further than the Citori 625 Feather.

The new Benelli Vinci marks a revolution in hunting shotguns. Benelli presents the fastest-shooting, softest-kicking, most reliable lightweight 12-gauge shotgun in the world. The innovative design of this semi auto shotgun raises the standard in firearms technology. Driven by a passion for efficiency and simplicity, Benelli engineers have advanced the cutting edge. The superbly balanced Vinci embodies a new way of looking at shotgun design. The revolutionary new In-Line Inertia Driven® operating system, with superior reliability and lightning fast speed, is the simplest semi-auto shotgun operating system ever devised.

Advanced ergonomics assure fluid gun movement. Combine that with the ComforTech® Plus recoil reduction system, and Benelli puts in your hands the world’s softest-kicking shotgun. In recent lab tests, the competition had up to 72-percent more felt recoil than the Vinci. And, its modular design makes Vinci the easiest shotgun on the planet to assemble and disassemble. No wonder it’s named for Leonardo da Vinci, the great Italian Renaissance inventor, artist, and thinker who shattered the technological boundaries of his world. Let the revolution begin.

This is one of only 500 ever made, serial number is below the 100 count. She comes with one 30rnd magazine, BSA red/green/blue dot sight, iron sights, shoots 9mm 

ABOUT THE SP10:
The SP10 fires from a closed and locked bolt in semi-automatic mode. This gun has a unique roller delayed blowback - locked-bolt system, and can be fitted with an illuminating flashlight inside the forward handguard. Basically, this is a semi auto version of the new MP10 submachinegun. These weapons are based on the MP5's technology but all the flaws with the MP5 have been removed. For example the thin sheet metal receiver is replaced with a steel insert molded composite reciever that is 10 times more impact resistant.

The basic configuration of this weapon makes for an ideal size, weight, and capable CQB weapon system

Over 75ft of paracord rope braided on the sling..  U never know when you need some rope when hunting,camping, etc..  


Parachute cord (also paracord or 550 cord) is a lightweight nylon kernmantle rope originally used in the suspension lines of US parachutes during World War II. Once in the field, paratroopers found this cord useful for many other tasks. It is now used as a general purpose utility cord by both military personnel and civilians. This versatile cord was even used by astronauts during STS-82, the second Space Shuttle mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope.[1]
The braided sheath has a high number of interwoven strands for its size, giving it a relatively smooth texture. The all-nylon construction makes paracord fairly elastic; depending on the application this can be either an asset or a liability.
While the U.S. military has no overall diameter requirements in its specifications, in the field 550 cord typically measures 5/32"" (4mm) in diameter.

I can also make paracord wrist ban, can wrap your knife with it, or anything just let me know.

Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use."

The SW99 features an internal striker, as opposed to the classical external hammer. It is chambered in 9mm  The pistol lacks a manual safety; instead a de-cocking button is placed on the top rear section of the slide, which when actuated, places the firearm into double-action mode. This mechanism differs with each variation of the action, which will be explained below. The SW99 features several safety features including a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide, a protruding, red-painted cocking indicator, and a drop safety. As with the P99, the cocking indicator does not protrude from the slide of the QA variant unless the weapon is fired, as it is in a constant partially cocked state.[3] The SW99 also features a fully supported chamber design, which leaves no portion of the chambered round exposed. Because of this there is less chance of injury to the shooter and/or destruction of the pistol, should the casing head rupture.[1]

The unique and ergonomic grip of this pistol was designed by the renowned Italian match pistol grip designer, Cesar Morini. Much like the P99, Design differences between the P99 and SW99 are most notable on the frame of the pistol; the grip and trigger guard both have a slightly different shape. The slide is somewhat different as well, offering serrations in both the front and rear of the slide, while the P99 only has them on the rear.

I put <100 rounds through the gun with this sight attached, and it's still got all the stickers on it, and is still running on the original set of batteries. I've even got the box and manual for it. It really might as well be brand new. Four aiming dots to compensate for the drop of a .223 over distance, and it takes AA batteries, so you can pick up replacements at the store instead of having to order expensive CR-123s online. Trades will be considered, but I'd much prefer the cash, so you'll have to make it worth my while.
