I am one of a few FFL'S in Arizona that carry and believe in the Plum Crazy Composite Lower Receiver.I have several in stock as of this writing.

Today, I am pairing up the Plum Crazy Lower receiver with the CMMG M4-LEP II UPPER WITH Gas Piston System

Gas Piston systems operate cleaner then the direct gas impingement operating systems. With the piston system, the propellant gases that are being diverted at the gas block are now vented at the gas block, instead in the operating system of the upper receiver. Since the fouling from the gas system is not being vented in to the action of your firearm, it stays cooler and cleaner. Our system is designed around the short stroke piston operation. The piston pushes the anti tilt one piece carrier, which unlocks the bolt and allows the piston to return home while the bolt carrier continues to cycle independently. The upper is built off of our standard forged A3 receiver with M4 feed ramps. The chrome plated gas piston is mounted in a solid one piece steel gas block attached to the barrel by pins. The Gas Block's 1913 Piccatinny rail is receiver height and requires a front sight designed to be mounted on the same plane as the rear sight. The dedicated, piston specific, anti-tilt bolt carrier is one piece, machined with the piston impingement key(not a bolt on). The carrier uses our standard Mil-Spec bolt. The barrel is our 4140 steel, M4 profile, 5.56mm chamber and bore, 1/9 twist ratio and 1/2x28 threaded barrel and our proprietary WASP surface treatment. The upper is finished with M4 handguard caps, M4 handguards and an A2 flash hider installed with a crush washer. The piston gas block has a gas shut off setting for use with a suppressor to allow for maximum noise reduction. You must replace the crush washer with a peel washer if you plan to mount your suppressor on the original flash hider. Fits on any standard Mil-Spec lower receiver. All uppers have been factory head spaced and test fired. There are no upgrade options available with this model. Nickel Teflon bolt carriers are discontinued and now come with a phosphated carrier. 



The Plum Crazy Complete Lower Assembly with 6-position collapible stock is engineered using fiber reinforced composite material,more resilient to damage than aluminum.These lower receivers have been extensively tested and proven.HF,FN and Glock all use polymers to bring their products into the new millennium.Now there is an AR-15 that sets the standard for the next generation of shooting enthusiasts.1-weighs approximately half that of forged aluminum.2-durability surpasses forged aluminum.3-impervious to chemicals including acids,fuels, and salts.4-reduced wear properties and no color loss from wear.5-engineered for acceptance of Mil-Spec Parts(less winter trigger)

New Current Issue GI sleeping system, $200 or best offer. Brand new with all 4 parts: Gortex Bivey Cover, Compression bag, Green Patrol Bag and inner black mummy bag, 
Temp range is from Tropical to -50F (50 degrees below zero) 
This is an amazing breakthrough in universal Sleeping bags. The Gortex outer bivey cover is a self contained shelter in itself and will keep you dry in any weather conditions yet allows moisture to escape so you are comfortable even in hot climates. The Bags are used separately or in combination to provide the proper temp range. In hot climates, Just the Gortex cover is used. In moderate weather down to 20 degrees, the cover and green patrol bags are used . In temp to -10F, the mummy bag and Gortex cover are used. When all 3 bags are combined, temp protection is good to -50F, (50 degrees below zero F). For storage and transport the system is stuffed into the compression bag and then cinched up to about the size of a basketball.

I have had it for a few years and shot indoor bullseye pistol at Stoughton Conservation Club.  It is very accurate and reliable.  The factory finish comes as a rough parkerizing.  I had it professionally Duracoated in ""matte black"".  The Duracoat smoothed out the finish and the slide is much smoother.  

I comes with two original magazines, original hard case, manual, and red dot scope.   The red dot has a really crisp dot which makes it perfect for bullseye pistol shooting.  The grip is lso adjustable for had size.  I put the skate-board tape on but you can remove it.

In afganistan it has been nicknamed the poison bullet for a reason bc it is known to do so much damage on impact...
Smith & Wesson has recently released a MP 15/ AR 15 chambered in this round ( 5.45 x 39mm ) because they have found out what so many others have ! That this is an awesome round, and is sooo much cheaper than the 223, and ammo is plentyful... Bushmaster, DPMS, and Adams Arms are just a few more who have followed in the footsteps of S&W , and released rifles also chambered in this awesome caliber !

I have acouple of these and love them !  I have decided to Trade or possibly sell one... However I would rather Trade than sell, but will sell if the price is right...

Here is a few guns I would be interested in trading for :
AR 10 ( .308 ), AR 15 , or Sniper rifles

All have been refurbished, everything checked out. Any laptop over $200 is covered under warranty for 30 days except the batteries (they are depletable, like the ones in your car). However if you need a battery for one you bought from me (or even one you didn't) let me know and I will get you in touch with my vendor(s)... they are about 1/2 price of what batteries plus charges. These all have fresh corporate OS and utility packages installed: OS, Symantec A/N (corporate never expires), office 2k3 or 2k7 (depends on model but 2K3 has the compatibility patch so it will work with 2k7 files). Some also have Nero 7/9 (depends on the OS), power DVD, ANYDVD/CloneDVD/CloneCD. ALL LAPTOPS HAVE WIFI!

This is a former VA State Police pistol that I picked up quite a while back. This is a former police duty gun, not a pristine safe queen. It is in good shape, but does show holster wear. It is the full length slide model with the decocker, no safety, in satin stainless finish.

They only made about 3100 of these and they are excellent, strong, reliable pistols. This one has been through the factory recall on the decocker lever, and has the 2nd gen grips. It has no magazine disconnect safety and is marked as such.

Also included will be three S&W stainless magazines, all with the updated followers. I will also give you the ammo I have for it, which is 100rds of ball, 40 winchester silvertips, and a full load of federal hydrashoks for all three mags. At current prices for 10mm, that's no small amount of value.

I will include the holster and magazine pouch if you want them, but they did not take aging well and are pretty rough. It's probably better than no holster at all, but they're ugly. Luckily the gun took aging fine; it shoots great, and looks fine.

What I am interested in:

I am interested in the Kel-tec SU-16. Likewise, I am interested in a bolt-action in a lighter centerfire caliber (.223, .243, as high as .308). And am very interested in the EOTech 500 series of sights, but am looking for optics in general for my flat-top AR-15. I would also be interested in certain .45acp duty sidearms (Sig 220, USP, etc).

Aside from this, I'm pretty open on trades, and likewise open to reasonable cash+trade offers. I will do FFL to FFL so long as you pay for the shipping and handle the details, and will also do FTF in the Tidewater area. Heck, if the trade is particularly interesting, I will drive farther. Shoot me an email and we'll see. If we do FTF, I will want to see a VA driver's license and voter's reg card, CCW permit, or security license. Active Duty military ID will probably work too, so long as you are a resident."

It comes with all you see in the pics. The arrows are horton lightning strick 2's . I took it in trade on a rifle. I am not a cross bow guy so I would also consider a trade on a firearm.

I have a bunch of reloading stuff for an M95 Budapest carbine that I purchased, with every intent of using, and still never have. It is pretty much a complete package of reloading stuff to get started on making your own 8x56r ammo!

I'd prefer to sell it all as a whole package to get rid of it all at once, but if I get enough people who are interested in certain items, I'll start breaking it up into seperate groups.



What I have:

21 clips - $100
64 pulled FMJ bullets - $15
298 pieces of unused Grafs brass - $180
(the brass is in sealed bags of 100 pieces with the exception of the opened bag that I lost 2 pieces)
Lee reloading dies - $30
SizingGas check seating die - $10
Box of 1000 gas checks - $30
Lee bullet casting molds (2)- $40
(One casting mold is unused, the other has been used to cast bullets.)

I would like to sell ALL of this all at once, for a total of $385. 

I also have the Budapest Carbine still, but prefer not to sell it unless we can arrange a FTF meet. However, if someone does want the carbine, I'd sell it for $150. 

If you want both the carbine and all the reloading stuff, I'd sell the package for $525.

Regardless of how much you purchase, shipping will be paid by the buyer. I will package items as tightly as possible to save on cost. 

Contact me at REDACTED if interested, and my location is in Spokane, WA if anybody wants to meet FTF to avoid shipping fees etc."

This rifle is really clean. I just cleaned and oiled it, it had tiny rust spots on the barrel. Now they are little white spots, so the pictures look spotty, but it just needs a little blueing.
I live in town and haven't shot it much. I received it after my grandpa died, so I don't know it's history.

For those who know/care there is no checkering and the stock as been chipped and glued back together. I never even known the whole time I've had it and if you look it's still hard to see.  Who ever did it, did a great job.
