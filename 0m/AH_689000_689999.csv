So please don't email me and tell me these are for sale all over for $500, this is a custom gun and I don't have to sell it.  

This Pistol operates like a pistol that sells for 3 or 4 times my asking price.  I have a Colt Gold Cup Match and this pistol shoots every bit as good at that one does.  I have 3 1911's and I am going to bring it down to 2 of them.  

The only trade I'll consider is a .22 Magnum Pistol or rifle.  I am going to be quite picky on what I take in trade because I am not overly excited about selling this pistol.  I'll also be selling a Kimber Raptor II at the same time and will keep which ever one does not sell first.  This pistol comes with box, books and bushing wrench.  I have put about 700 rounds through this pistol and it looks like it has been less than 50.  It has been well taken care or and completely stripped and cleaned after each time it has been shot.  You can email me with your contact information and I'll get back to you.  If you do not include a name and phone number #  I will not reply.  Low-Ball offers will be ignored.   

I will not respond to rude emails either so you can't get my email address.  (Sorry to be this way but there are a lot of petty fools out there)"

       The Calico M950 is a semi-automatic pistol (also classified as a carbine) manufactured by Calico Light Weapons Systems in the United States. Its main feature, along with all the other guns of the Calico system, is to feed from a proprietary helical magazine mounted on top, available in 50-rounds or 100-rounds capacity.

What Is a Bull Barrel?

A bull barrel is a type of gun barrel that does not taper outward, making it completely cylindrical. This makes the barrel stiffer, which reduces the amplitude of the vibrations in the barrel created by by the sudden increase of air pressure in the chamber when the gun goes off. The point of the bull barrel is to reduce the negative effect these vibrations have on aim."

It's been duracoated woodland green (not the best call but seemed like a good idea at the time), but this can be easily recoated. Also comes with the EZ-Mag system which allows you to use modified magazines without the duckbills on em. The original EZ-Mag was polymer and wore down after about a year of use so I had an identical copy milled out of aluminum. Comes with 1 modified Tapco 20 round magazine (also green).

Number 1 is a .38 long caliber 1892 Colt ""New Army -Navy""  with a 4 "" barrel it is a large frame civilian model this particular weapon was oringinally nickle plated with brown ""gutta percha"" grips.  the grips are fully checkered and have COLT with the rampant COLT emblem in a circle.This is the Second issue model of Colts First swing out cylinder revolver and as such has the flat latch and  dual cylinder notches. The cylinder rotates COUNTER CLOKWISE on this model and wasn't changed until the next evolution of pistols to Clockwise rotation as is now  standard on Colt pistols. Patent dates on this revolver are Aug.5 84,Nov.6 88  Mar.5 95 ( month abreviations are Original)

Number 2 is a Police Positive(First Issue) in .38 New Police as determined by the final patent date on barrel. This weapon is a medium frame blued with a 6 '' barrel and black fully checkered hard rubber grips with COLT in an oval. This pistol also has the flat latch. This is marked on the frame below the ""Rampant Colt"" NEW POLICE.  Overall condition on this pistol is excellent ! Lockup is tight and bore is excellent, Grips are as close to perfect as I have ever come across!!  Both the trigger and hammer on this pistol are fire blued and are as new. Patent dates on this pistol read :Aug. 5 1884, June 5 1900, July 4 1905 (note the July 4th patent date)

Number 3 is a Pocket Positive (First Issue) in .32 Colt CTG. as determined by the final patent date on barrel. This weapon is a small frame pocket model with 3"" barrel.

The patent dates on this pistol read: Aug. 5 1884, June 5 1900, July 4 1905 ( note again the July 4th patent date)

This gun can SHOOT. Regularly hits human sized targets at 500 meters, well beyond this shooter's normal skill. This is NOT a Gibbs rifle, reproduction or fake. All marks on receiver are offset to account for factory mounted scope rail. Serial number dates to 1943 manufacture. Bolt and receiver match, no modifications beyond factory drill and tap. Rifle was rebarreled with a Remington Barrel Dated 9-44. Stock is the correct ""C"" Style in unissued condition. Scope and scope rail are modern Redfield production. The last time that the CMP received a small cache of 1903A4 parts the actions alone sold for more than $2,700 each. Act now and get an original piece of sniper History. Asking price is $2,500 as is, or $2,200 without scope and rail. Can work on price with trades.

These Blue Lines were developed for Law Enforcement and are now in the civilian market. Mine is in excellent condition. The weapon has the Blue Line Sig logo on top of the slide. I assume it was only used by the officer to qualify as it looked new when I got it. I have fired 50 rounds through it and although it shoots great I found that it does not fit my large hands very good. Because it was removed from service the 12 rnd mags have been replaced with 10 rnd. Included in this sale is a total of 5 mags all marked SigPro 357Sig and 40S&W the mags are good for either caliber as this weapon can be changed over to a 40S&W by exchanging the barrel, which is very easy to do (does not come with extra barrel). It also comes with a cleaning kit and lock and key.
I want $550.00 or will consider any and all trades of equal value. You must be at least 21 years old and willing to show proof and also sign a Bill of Sale."

Up for sale is a ""Cold Steel"" Artist's Proof co-signed By Col Millett and by Don Stivers.  I'm offering this great Signed and Numbered Limited Edition Print at a very reasonable price. You will not find another one like this ever anywhere. I personally had Colonel Millett sign and date this print in Korea 51 years to the day of the famous action where he earned the Medal of Honor. This print is signed twice by Colonel Millett (once where he co-signed with Stivers in the left margin, and a very bold signature and date on the top-left of the print).

This is an Artists Proof #68 of 95.  I framed and matted this print, and have included two of Colonel Millett's commemorative Medal of Honor coins which he gave me in Korea while I was escorting him at the Hill 180 ceremony, Osan AFB Korea in February 2002. 

Capt. Millett, Company E, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action. While personally leading his company in an attack against a strongly held position he noted that the 1st Platoon was pinned down by small-arms, automatic, and antitank fire. Capt. Millett ordered the 3d Platoon forward, placed himself at the head of the 2 platoons, and, with fixed bayonet, led the assault up the fire-swept hill. In the fierce charge Capt. Millett bayoneted 2 enemy soldiers and boldly continued on, throwing grenades, clubbing and bayoneting the enemy, while urging his men forward by shouting encouragement. Despite vicious opposing fire, the whirlwind hand-to-hand assault carried to the crest of the hill. His dauntless leadership and personal courage so inspired his men that they stormed into the hostile position and used their bayonets with such lethal effect that the enemy fled in wild disorder. During this fierce onslaught Capt. Millett was wounded by grenade fragments but refused evacuation until the objective was taken and firmly secured. The superb leadership, conspicuous courage, and consummate devotion to duty demonstrated by Capt. Millett were directly responsible for the successful accomplishment of a hazardous mission and reflect the highest credit on himself and the heroic traditions of the military service."

It seems the previous owner didn't shoot it much at all. Accuracy was excellent. The bore on this rifle is bright and shiny with strong rifling. This rifle has no import markings whatsoever. The Yugoslavian Crest appears to have been scrubbed off at some point in it's service, and it still bears the ""preduzece44"" arsenal marking along with the original German ""Mod.98"" marking. External finish is excellent, with the receiver showing a slight bit more overall wear than the other parts. Overall, 95% finish. The stock is all original beautiful blonde laminate. This rifle has a cleaning rod and sight hood, along with a reproduction sling.

Ammo is 1956 Yugoslavian surplus 196 grain heavy ball on chargers. I have never had any issues whatsoever with this ammo in my M.48, it is PHENOMINAL stuff.

The pistol comes with 2 magazines, the original box, paperwork, empty chamber plug and lock.  What can I say, it's a Stainless Kimber Raptor II that has been tweaked just a bit and looks as new.  It was cleaned after each time it was fired and shows no wear on the barrel, bushing or slide.  


The only trade I'll consider is a .22 Magnum Pistol or rifle.  I am going to be quite picky on what I take in trade because I am not overly excited/motivated to sell this pistol.  I'll also be selling my Smith & Wesson Custom Shop 1911 at the same time and will keep which ever one does not sell first.  If you do not include a name and phone number #  I will not reply.  Low-Ball offers will be ignored.  I will listen to reasonable cash offers but please don't tell me that you can find these all day long for some stupid low price.

I will include (10) 20rd CMI steel magazines as well. $1900 for just the rifle, ARMS mount, and magazines.

 I am not gonna price everything out for you, the people that do that are overpricing their guns and trying to get what they paid new for out of a used gun which is idiotic. If you know your stuff then you'll appreciate this set up. I also have a drag bag, 300+ rounds of 7.62x51 ammo, and a Leupold Mark 4 scope I can add in for the right price if you want to buy the whole package. Contact me with further questions. Lowballs will be ignored. FTF in Colorado Springs preferred, must be legal to own a rifle. Only trade I am interested in is a LWRC SPR so if its not that, don't ask. Thanks!"

Snap On MODIS scan tool with domestic and asian coverage up to 2006. All adapter plugs and cables are present. Full set of personality keys. Full set of lab scope cables. Extra battery. Software version 7.4. Bought it years ago and it has been a fantastic diagnostic tool. The trouble shooter function, code tips, and symptom tips are life savers. The lab scope and component tests are in depth and very informative. I just don't use it much any more and would like to see it go to better use that gathering dust around my shop. Price is OBO. This would be a great addition to any shop or any mechanic. Its easily up-gradable to cover later model vehicles, european, heavy duty, or set up a gas analyser. feel free to ask questions (that i haven't already answered) or shoot me an offer (don't ask me what my bottom dollar is, make an offer!). I would be happy to demonstrate it to any serious buyer.
