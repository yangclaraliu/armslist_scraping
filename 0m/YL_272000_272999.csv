It is a 1942 Izhevsk made M91/30, it is some kind of refurbish rifle like most, but with the exception of no Ukrainian refurb marks on it. Parts are non matching (But that's the beauty of it), all parts are electro penciled besides the barrel/receiver. 

The wood finishing is beautiful, unlike any I've ever seen (Came like this from import, apparently), I've asked around and some have said it may be Czech re-arsenaled, but I'm unsure of how true that is.

The stock is Sako Finland marked, with an old pre October Revolution cartouche as well as a Tula ""Oval T"" stamp.  Parts include a Finnish D mark (Bolt body), New England Westinghouse & Czech marked cocking knob, and a Remington marked rear barrel band. Bore has been slugged and comes out to .314, so be sure to check your ammo before you shoot surplus out of it because it may come out to be like a bowling ball in a sewer pipe and accuracy will suffer greatly.


It is not counter bored, rifling is strong and hits accurately at 100m with correct dia. ammunition. Price is $250 obo, I do accept trades however.

(It is the bottom rifle on the main picture if you can't tell from the other pictures) Contact me if you want more pictures of the rifle, and of any specific markings that you may want to see."

Also comes with two additional 8 round mags. All 4 mags have pinky rest extentions on them. Gun has been fired 100 rounds of ball ammo. Very accurate and reliable. 

The gun out the door was $580 including taxes. The extra two mags were $40 a piece so $80 combined. I had to call Smith and Wesson to ask for the pinky rests. The only mags that were not on backorder were the mags without pinky rest. So, the manufacturer sent me 7 pinky rest extentions. Why so many extra? Who knows, but hey, their customer service is outstanding and exceeded my expections. I am selling everything for $600, firm since its only seen 100 rounds.

Mine is the second run bar10 modified bushmaster .308. It has NO issues with bolt and chamber. 
***THIS IS ACTUAL GUN IN PHOTOS***
This series is a highly sought after model that is hard to find! 
Someone asked the other day why is this gun hard to find? Because everyone that owns this model keeps it, due to it reliability and accuracy.

The BAR-10 was meant to compete in the .308 market against Armalite's AR-10 series rifles and Springfield Armory's M1A Rifle by offering a .308 rifle that could accept the relatively inexpensive metric and inch pattern FN FAL magazines.

**Due to funding and lack of demand this complete model was sold to Rock River Arms in the 2006 year range** 
Now that the demand has increased for this caliber- Bushmaster has came out with an OCR model. The OCR gun is a nice model but was not built to the standards of the original BAR10. 

A2- Bar10 308 - With factory upgraded Skeleton stock and Izzy Muzzle Brake

ONE OF THE MOST ACCURATE 308s ON THE MARKET

It is in perfect working order, with minimal signs of ever being used.

The Bushmaster .308 series was manufactured in late2004-2005

THIS IS NOT THE O.R.C.- This is the first edition that was built better than all the rest to beat the competition. was the only ambidextrous 308 on the market! Perfect for Righties or Lefties!!! 
These guns sold for around $1,800 stock.

Heres what Bushmaster has to say about this gun:
The magazine controls are ingenious, both in how they have been adapted to the FAL magazine and in how their ergonomics offer the shooter improved control. The magazine catch is a spring-loaded latch that engages the locking lug on the FAL magazine’s upper rear face. The release is fully ambidextrous. When the release is pressed from either side, a lever retracts the latch and the magazine drops free.

Like the magazine catch, the bolt release is a departure. It consists of a one-piece bar that extends across the bottom of the rifle just forward of the trigger guard behind the magazine well. Pressing down on either side releases the bolt. The optional ambidextrous safety transforms the Bushmaster .308 into the only fully ambidextrous AR-type rifle available. Bushmaster also eliminated the sometimes inconvenient charging handle latch, replacing it with a hidden spring-loaded detent in the center of the charging handle that engages a recess in the upper receiver.

The upper and lower receivers are made of forged 7075-T6 aluminum. About half of the .308’s components interchange with those of .223-Rem. caliber rifles, but none are stressed, so reliability is unaffected. Two versions of the Bushmaster .308 are available—an A2 type with fixed carry handle and sights and an A3 variant with a flat top upper receiver and a three-rail gas block. Barrels are rifled with four lands and grooves in a 1:10"" right-hand twist.

The Bushmaster rifle came with an optional Ace Ltd. “ARFX” skeleton stock. This stock replaces the “A2” type fiberglass stock with one of hard anodized aluminum that is both lighter and stronger than the original. The stock has a closed-cell foam cover over the buffer tube. This provides a much improved cheek weld, and dampens vibration and noise. The stock comes with a 1/2"" thick recoil pad that has a “tacky” feel that helps hold the stock in position."

Hello, selling a SIG p238 in mint condition that has never been fired. Beautiful two tone. I really dont want to sell this but need the money for an unexpected bill. The sig p238 is chambered in 380 and holds 6 in the mag. This sig has sig night sights on it the glow in the dark, pretty cool. Has 1911 style thumb safety and slide release. The manufacturing date puts it right at a year old. The gun also comes with case, manuel, cable lock, and 100 rounds of 380 white box ammo. No trades need the money, and wont sell without ammo, what will I do with it? let me know if you have any questions thanks."

This is what I have:


This machine is basically new. I could not use a machine and chose to have a surgery for my sleep apnea. The machine has less than 2 hours use on it. Asking $550 or a firearm trade, which is is about a half or so of what it costs for a base (unlike this one) model. Link to website: www.bipapautomseries.respironics.com 
The Respironics BiPAP Auto M Series combines auto adjusting pressure delivery with the breath-by-breath pressure relief of Bi-Flex. Machine has Encore Pro SmartCard technology. Bi-Flex softens airflow at inhalation and exhalation, making breathing more natural and comfortable for patients. In Bi-Flex mode, patient-adjustable pressure relief is provided at the critical stages. BiPAP Auto M Series Bi-Flex Humidifer uses Bi-Flex pressure relief technology to provide CPAP humidifier therapy. This technology offers pressure relief at inhalation and exhalation to make BiPAP therapy more like natural breathing. By tracking each breath, Bi-Flex delivers pressure relief at three critical points in the breathing cycle: the transition from exhalation to inhalation, the transition from inhalation to exhalation and during exhalation. 
Now, I did get tons of emails and offers and questions, so here you go:
I do not have a communicable disease.
Machine did not work for MY sleep apnea (I was not a good candidate for it to begin with, but stupid insurcance companies demand you fork out for one along with a sleep study before they do pillar or any other procedure) thus I gave it a shot for two 40min or so evenings and gave up.
It is in a full working order.
Why is it cheap? Because I am just trying to cover my deductible I had to pay - not to make money on you.
Am I willing to meet? yes, within 45miles of a 54956(neenah, WI) zip.
Can I ship?  Yes, add $18 for USPS shipping anywhere you are at.
Payment method:  discrete Paypal (gift), USPS money order or Cash.
would I consider a $98 FleetFarm mosin in even trade?  No, thank you :)

I have the original box. I will sell the rifle and scope separately.

I bought the rifle on 12/23/11 from an individual who bought it from another individual.  He said that he was told the rifle had been shot very little.  He said that he had shot it very little as well.  I ran a couple of wet patches down the bore and put it in the safe.  My gunsmith bore scoped the rifle on 1/5/12.  He said the throat and rifling looked brand new.  I loaded 10 rounds with 73.0 grains of Hodgdon H4831SC powder, Federal no. 215 primers, and Sierra 180 grain MatchKings with a C.O.L. of 3.5 inches (which was .01” off of the lands and grooves).  The rounds loaded into the magazine. I used this recipe because it was what I had lying around.  I would have rather used Retumbo with 220 grain Berger VLDs.   I did everything to the brass except turn the necks.  I shot the rifle on 1/5/12 to make sure the scope tracked and to check accuracy.  It was pretty windy.  I shot one round from a cold, clean bore.  I then moved 8 clicks right and shot, 8 clicks down and shot, 8 clicks left and shot, and the 8 clicks up and shot (see photo).  I took a small break and looked at the target and marked it.  I also adjusted the scope.  I then shot 5 rounds.  The cold bore shot went a little high and left as did the first cold bore shot.  The other 4 shots went into a .32 inch group (see photo).  I was shooting at 100 yards.  Pretty impressive for just throwing some ammo together!
The rifle and scope are in excellent condition.  $2,400.00 for the complete package plus actual shipping cost from my FFL to your FFL or $1,200.00 for the rifle minus the scope, rings, and bases plus actual shipping cost from my FFL to your FFL.  $1,300 for the scope, rings, and bases plus actual shipping cost.

Threaded for a flash hider/muzzle brake. Custom low profile ambi charging handle. Has picatinny rails mounted top bottom and sides, and currently wears a NCStar 3-9x40 illuminated reticle scope. Also, my friend runs a machine shop and we cut ports in the upper barrel shroud to dissipate heat which builds up quick on a factory rifle. (5 magazines and it's hot to the touch) This was done on a $20,000 HAAS CNC mill. (no dremel tool hack job here) These rifles are becoming scarce.

It was taken in a trade a long while back, I have never shot it myself and have no idea the round count. Made in 1981, this is the second production model of the Beretta 92, has a one-sided slide-mounted safety and a heel mag release. Two magazines, each of which holds 15 rounds and is an original factory mag (will not work in more recent 92 pistols with the mag release in the usual spot by the trigger guard).

The gun has a beautiful blued finish, 95% with only the usual wear on the barrel from the slide and some light wear in the trigger bar area. The finish is beautiful and deep, and the action is as smooth as glass. Has a stainless (non-captive) guiderod that as far as I know came standard from the factory.

There is a single issue with the gun - it is currently missing the takedown retainer spring. This does not affect function, but the retaining button for the takedown lever now slides back and forth freely. The recoil assembly holds the lever solidly in place and it will not come undone on its own, but I would want to replace that spring before firing it. I have a spring on backorder from Brownells, no say yet on when it will be in, but I am more than happy to mail it to whomever want to buy this gun when it comes in.

The grips were handcarved with an ornate scrollwork pattern by Nellie Whitener, who does lots of beautiful carved grips as well as ostrich eggs. I also am including a pair of Pachmayr wraparound rubber grips, they're ugly as sin but they add a little cushion and grip.

Please note that there were two different runs of production of this model. The first run is stamped bar 10 bushmaster on receiver.. This series had issues with bolt and chamber; the fixed series is stamped on receiver as mod. Bushmaster .308. Mine is the second run bar10 modified bushmaster .308. It has NO issues with bolt and chamber. 
***THIS IS ACTUAL GUN IN PHOTOS***
This series is a highly sought after model that is hard to find! 
Someone asked the other day why is this gun hard to find? Because everyone that owns this model keeps it, due to it reliability and accuracy.

The BAR-10 was meant to compete in the .308 market against Armalite's AR-10 series rifles and Springfield Armory's M1A Rifle by offering a .308 rifle that could accept the relatively inexpensive metric and inch pattern FN FAL magazines.

**Due to funding and lack of demand this complete model was sold to Rock River Arms in the 2006 year range** 
Now that the demand has increased for this caliber- Bushmaster has came out with an OCR model. The OCR gun is a nice model but was not built to the standards of the original BAR10. 

A2- Bar10 308 - With factory upgraded Skeleton stock and Izzy Muzzle Brake

ONE OF THE MOST ACCURATE 308s ON THE MARKET

It is in perfect working order, with minimal signs of ever being used.

The Bushmaster .308 series was manufactured in late2004-2005

THIS IS NOT THE O.R.C.- This is the first edition that was built better than all the rest to beat the competition. was the only ambidextrous 308 on the market! Perfect for Righties or Lefties!!! 
These guns sold for around $1,800 stock.

Heres what Bushmaster has to say about this gun:
The magazine controls are ingenious, both in how they have been adapted to the FAL magazine and in how their ergonomics offer the shooter improved control. The magazine catch is a spring-loaded latch that engages the locking lug on the FAL magazine’s upper rear face. The release is fully ambidextrous. When the release is pressed from either side, a lever retracts the latch and the magazine drops free.

Like the magazine catch, the bolt release is a departure. It consists of a one-piece bar that extends across the bottom of the rifle just forward of the trigger guard behind the magazine well. Pressing down on either side releases the bolt. The optional ambidextrous safety transforms the Bushmaster .308 into the only fully ambidextrous AR-type rifle available. Bushmaster also eliminated the sometimes inconvenient charging handle latch, replacing it with a hidden spring-loaded detent in the center of the charging handle that engages a recess in the upper receiver.

The upper and lower receivers are made of forged 7075-T6 aluminum. About half of the .308’s components interchange with those of .223-Rem. caliber rifles, but none are stressed, so reliability is unaffected. Two versions of the Bushmaster .308 are available—an A2 type with fixed carry handle and sights and an A3 variant with a flat top upper receiver and a three-rail gas block. Barrels are rifled with four lands and grooves in a 1:10"" right-hand twist.

The Bushmaster rifle came with an optional Ace Ltd. “ARFX” skeleton stock. This stock replaces the “A2” type fiberglass stock with one of hard anodized aluminum that is both lighter and stronger than the original. The stock has a closed-cell foam cover over the buffer tube. This provides a much improved cheek weld, and dampens vibration and noise. The stock comes with a 1/2"" thick recoil pad that has a “tacky” feel that helps hold the stock in position."

Unlike other new-comers to this specialized market, who just modified their existing 2 3/4"" - 3"" shotguns, the 835® was designed to stay the course. The robust bolt, receiver, and other components are specifically sized for the longer shells and the downrange punishment they dish out. 

In addition, all 835® Ulti-Mag® smooth bore barrels are overbored to 10 gauge bore dimensions, reducing recoil and producing exceptionally uniform patterns from both light and heavy shot charges. Working in tandem with the performance-enhancing overbored barrels, strategic placement of eight ports on each side of the 835® barrel direct gasses upward and outward to not only reduce felt recoil, but to minimize muzzle jump for quick second shot recovery."
