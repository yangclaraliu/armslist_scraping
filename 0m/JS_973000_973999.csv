Maybe 500 rounds through the barrel. Cleaned every time and in absolutely perfect condition. The Original XD series is very similar to the Glock in principal. Superior to Glock in some ways. The factory trigger is very smooth and The grip angle is more comfortable than a Glock. The XD has a couple added features that some people like. Drawn striker (cocked) indicator, loaded chamber indicator and an extra grip safety similar to a 1911. The recoil on the XD is much softer than a Glock due to its added weight and robust recoil spring/guide rod. This pistol comes with the original case, factory XD gear & 3 12 round magazines. 
Not included but optional for the $$ is a Viridian SXD green laser sight (AWESOME) and holster to accommodate the mounted laser.

Specifications: Barrel, Forged, Hammer (BFH)

Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. These do not include bolt carrier groups, charging handles or handguards.

BCM barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistant with these quality control procedures.

Cold Hammer Forged Barrels
This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM BFH series of barrels are made right here in the USA! (Just like all the BCM products.)

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

Has only 250 rounds through it and was meticulously cleaned after both times at the range. Auction includes three full sets of Magpul furniture in Flat Dark Earth, Foliage Green, and Black. Sets include: AFG2, MIAD, RVG, CTR, XTM panels, Ergo Ladder rail covers. A STR and an ACS stock in Flat Dark Earth are also included. I also have an EOTech 551 in Near Mint condition with GG&G flip lens covers for it and two sets of batteries with box, manual, and mounting screws! I also have a Troy Battle Rail-Carbine length in dark earth color new in its package! Rifle comes with the original Colt box, with its cleaning kit, sling, and manual. I have 13 magazines total: 4 Gen 2 Magpul 30 round PMAGs, 6 Gen 2 Magpul 20 round PMAGs, 1 Genuine Colt 30  round metal mag with mil spec follower, 1 Brownell's 30 round metal mag with chrome silicon spring and mil spec follower, and 1 Pro Mag 10 round magazine! I have around 1300-1400 rounds of .223 rem/5.56mm ammo. Most of it is Indepence XM193 mil spec ammo, some is American Eagle Tracers (VERY COOL AND FUN!) and some is PMC Bronze .223 Rem and the rest is Hornady Varmint V-Max and Zombie Z-Max (just like varmint). It would take me hours to list everything I have accessory-wise. 

RIFLE:
The rifle is only 3 weeks old, has only 250 rounds through it, has only been to the range twice, and was meticulously and PROPERLY cleaned after each time. The rifle was transported in a Flambeau rigid rifle case with ""egg carton"" foam to protect the rifle. It is in NEAR MINT to MINT condition. I had a Yankee Hill Machine ($75.00) upper/lower rail gas block put on to replace the front sight post/gas block that came from the factory, which I still have and is completely able to be put back on (some gun smiths ruin those by cutting or grinding them off. However mine is still flawless and still has the pins so it can be put back on if you want.

The rifle includes a DPMS Accu-Wedge to eliminate the wiggle between the upper and lower receivers. I also will include a pack of 10 Brownell's receiver shims to further eliminate play between the receivers. Both were purchased from Midway USA (so was the YHM gas block, by the way). I installed a Slide Fire Single Stage trigger group for a nicer trigger than factory in which i still have the factory trigger group and all the pins etc. I installed a Magpul Enhanced Trigger Guard made from mil spec aluminum. I also installed KNS precision Anti-Rotational trigger/hammer pins to prevent rotation which prevents wear in the pin holes for preventative maintenance. I also will include a Magpul ASAP single point sling adapter to replace the original receiver end plate and a Magpul MS3 third generation Single/Two point sling in Coyote Brown.

I will include a Slide Fire SSAR-15 SBS bump fire stock (newest version) which is a $400.00 stock, however the Magpul ASAP sling point attachment cannot be used with this as the stock needs to slide freely over the original receiver end plate. 

Overall, this rifle is an AWESOME and RARE purchase as you will have EVERYTHING you need to customize and deck out your gun to your liking and not to be limited by factory settings! This is a COLT, not a Bushmaster, Smith and Wesson, or any other imitation AR-15. Colt designed the original AR/M4/M16 therefore you know you are getting the best possible factory AR-15 on the market! Dont pass this oppurtunity to own a Colt M4 carbine with ALL the fixings (Magpul furniture, Slide Fire stock, EOTech Holographic Sight, 1300+ rds of ammo, plus much more!!!)

I can send any other specific pictures upon request also!

The rifle is easily worth $3500.00 in today's market plus the few grand worth of extras leaves me to ask around $5495.00. I know it sounds like alot, but you have to figure with this deal, you will not need ANYTHING else, this auction comes with it all to go to the range the day you get it!

ASKING $4999.00 but I am open to REASONABLE OFFERS! This complete listing is EASILY WORTH $6500.00 to $7000.00 due to the shear amount of extras including the AMMO, EOTECH 551, SLIDE FIRE STOCK, etc.!

I will sell to anyone but it has to be through an FFL dealer so its all legal etc."

Look if you have a new or like new very few rounds through it <200 I am looking. I am serious and I have cash in hand.  This is for real, I will not tell you how much I have to spend, but let's say it's about what a RRA was going for before this whole ""assault rifle"" ban talk came up. I would love an adjustable stock, and a quad rail but it isn't necessary. Also if you have it in .308 or .300 blackout that'd be even better, but I'm not going to turn away a .223/5.56. So please if you have a reasonable offer to shoot my way contact me. But if you want to try to rip me off then please try to make a sale to someone else.

If you're looking for something unique with a story at an affordable price, this is it. Extremely well built and will eat any ammo. I'm sorry, but these things are way cooler than an AR15 or AK47, which are overpriced. Much cheaper ammo.  

Folding stock is pin welded to it's closed position, making it officially a pistol. Having only a 10"" barrel, if the stock was unfolded, it would be considered an illegal short barreled rifle.

Since these are rarely seen, they have not been affected too much by the gun scare. I can see these models fetching AR and AK prices when people find them."

I am not a professional nor am I completely amateur.  I do this for fun, but like to make a little money too.  Can make it look stock-ish or like glass.  The glass look is much more costly, as it takes MUCH MORE TIME.  I don't throw a layer of polyuretHane on and call it a day.  (though i can if you want shiny and cheap).  I use tru oil and for the glass look its between 10 and 20 coats, 12 - 24 hours or drying in between, not including wet sanding and dry/clean time.   Normally around 75 bucks and up and it will take a few weeks.  You can email me for pics of work if interested.  Includes stripping the original finish and minor dent removal.  Can try to repair chunks missing but without cutting and replacing with new wood, wood filling doesn't stain right (though its ""stainable"").  I will place a 25 dollar flip flop out there, meaning I may need to charge up to 25 bucks more, usually on older stocks, if issues come up under the finish.  I will notify you and give you pictures before I work on the extra issues.  

These issues can include dent or holes that take more than 1 hour, cosmoline coming through the surface after 24 hours which takes extra stripping, then sanding, stripping, then sanding, over and over.  The cosmoline issues are usually with older milsurp guns such as mosins, sks, aks etc.

I'm trying to give you as much info as possible.  I'm not going to say i am the best, but i am good at what I do.  If you want me to make you a show quality stock, i will put 30 layers of glass (tru oil) on it and do my best, it will cost a little extra but if you are going to show it off somewhere and want to put my name next to it we can also work out a deal.

I WILL NOT DO PRICELESS FIREARMS.  I AM ALSO NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY LIGHT WATER OR MAKING DAMAGE VISIBLE.  I HAVE YET TO DAMAGE A STOCK OUT OF THE 10 I HAVE DONE, BUT THERE IS A FIRST FOR EVERYTHING.  IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING SMALL (LESS VALUABLE) YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO WORK ON, TO TEST MY WORK, BEFORE DOING SOMETHING BIGGER OR MORE VALUABLE, I WILL WORK OUT A DEAL WITH YOU."

This has been well taken care of, it has been cleaned after every trip to the range.  The grips have been changed to low profile grips for comfort as well as ease of carry.  The recoil spring has also been changed to allow for less felt recoil, I will include the origional if you want to see the difference. I also have a set of 3 different hammer springs which I was going to swap out and then decided to keep the heavier trigger pull for safety in carry.  It does have a decocker safety also.

I am not a professional nor am I completely amateur.  I do this for fun, but like to make a little money too.  Can make it look stock-ish or like glass.  The glass look is much more costly, as it takes MUCH MORE TIME.  I don't throw a layer of polyuretHane on and call it a day.  (though i can if you want shiny and cheap).  I use tru oil and for the glass look its between 10 and 20 coats, 12 - 24 hours or drying in between, not including wet sanding and dry/clean time.   Normally around 75 bucks and up and it will take a few weeks.  You can email me for pics of work if interested.  Includes stripping the original finish and minor dent removal.  Can try to repair chunks missing but without cutting and replacing with new wood, wood filling doesn't stain right (though its ""stainable"").  I will place a 25 dollar flip flop out there, meaning I may need to charge up to 25 bucks more, usually on older stocks, if issues come up under the finish.  I will notify you and give you pictures before I work on the extra issues.  

These issues can include dent or holes that take more than 1 hour, cosmoline coming through the surface after 24 hours which takes extra stripping, then sanding, stripping, then sanding, over and over.  The cosmoline issues are usually with older milsurp guns such as mosins, sks, aks etc.

I'm trying to give you as much info as possible.  I'm not going to say i am the best, but i am good at what I do.  If you want me to make you a show quality stock, i will put 30 layers of glass (tru oil) on it and do my best, it will cost a little extra but if you are going to show it off somewhere and want to put my name next to it we can also work out a deal.

I WILL NOT DO PRICELESS FIREARMS.  I AM ALSO NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY LIGHT WATER OR MAKING DAMAGE VISIBLE.  I HAVE YET TO DAMAGE A STOCK OUT OF THE 10 I HAVE DONE, BUT THERE IS A FIRST FOR EVERYTHING.  IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING SMALL (LESS VALUABLE) YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO WORK ON, TO TEST MY WORK, BEFORE DOING SOMETHING BIGGER OR MORE VALUABLE, I WILL WORK OUT A DEAL WITH YOU."

      This Revolver was owned by my Father and he was the first owner, I am selling this gun because my kids are kind of crazy.  The yoke cut is marked “N839957 / MOD-629”and the yoke is marked “75117 / F7 / S “. The rear face of the cylinder is marked with a “V”. The left side of the grip frame is marked “F7”, sideways “V”, “75117”, “F16”, “F14” and “S”. The underside of the grip frame is marked “N839957”. On the right side of the grip frame there is a “U” inside a circle, a “3” inside a heart and “7487”. The right sideplate has a large S&W logo and the right side of the frame has the four line “Marcas Registradas” address.Barrel Length: 6”...LSB#: 121112TA02....Make: Smith & Wesson...Model: Model 629 - .44 Magnum Stainless....Serial Number: N839557.....Year of Manufacture: 1980-1982...Caliber: .44 Special and .44 Magnum...Action Type: Single and Double Action Swing-Out Cylinder Revolver....Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked “SMITH & WESSON” and the right side of the barrel is marked “44 MAGNUM”....Type of Finish: Stainless Steel...Finish Originality: All Original
Box, Paperwork & Accessories: None

My Assessment: This is a stainless steel S&W .44 Magnum that has been handled more than it has been shot. There is no darkened ring around the firing pin bushing, and no darkening or fouling between the top of the forcing cone and the bottom of the top strap. It is possible that this revolver has not been fired since it left the factory. If you would like to be the one to break this in,"

For sell is a Hi point C9 in great shape has around 2000 rounds through it. The gun has had a trigger job and has a 3lb pull vs the stock 9lb pull. I think the stock grips are slippery so I put grip tape on the grips and gun but if that's not your thing is comes right off. Also comes with a pair of custom cherry grips that are showing some wear but still work great.

Gun also has a fully transferable warranty so if anything ever breaks or doesn't work the factory will fix it free of charge, no questions asked. The warranty is so good you could throw it off a hotel and they'll still fix it.

Here is some factory info on the Receiver. 

The CH22 billet precision machined receiver incorporates a stainless steel charging handle in the rear of the receiver that eliminates the traditional factory charging handle on the side of the rifle. The charging handle for the CH22 receiver operates transparently within the integral picatinney rail. Like an AR15, the rear charging handle makes charging or clearing your rifle fast and easy. The charging handle does not reciprocate with the bolt each time the rifle is fired and it is secured firmly in the closed position using a spring loaded ball detent.
 The use of a rear charging handle on the CH22 provides many functional and operational advantages not available with a traditional side charging factory bolt setup. Some of the advantages are

AMBIDEXTROUS FOR BOTH LEFT & RIGHT HANDED SHOOTERS

REVIEWS:
First field test of the SR556- Sheridan, Wyoming. Ruger factory sponsored prairie dog hunt. We were privileged to attend the hunt, and an Impact employee was the first to take an animal with the SR556 rifle!

Function and reliability were 100%. The dog town we were shooting at had dogs out to 360 yards. All ranging was done using the new Ziess 8x binoculars with range and holdover function. Even with a low 10x scope, dogs were taken all the way out to 361 yards. Very impressive for any rifle, and even more so for a carbine!

We were shooting Hornady TAP ammo, 55g, loaded into the P-Mags that are included with each rifle. Effect on the targets was devastating. Multiple hits and complex gymnastics by the dogs were the norm.

All in all, our experience with the SR556 was beyond our expectations. The gas system gives the gun a softer recoil that a standard gas AR, and the chamber/bolt area was much cleaner that a gas AR. This SR556 is a keeper, and a really good value with all the good kit that is part of the base rifle.

We have sold literally hunderds of the Ruger SR556 rifles. They are incredibly reliable and several of our customers report that even after thousands of rounds (some without cleaning) they have not experienced a single malfunction! 

If you don't know what a ""PISTON DRIVEN AR"" is....you need to do your homework.

The Kahr T9 is an automatic pistol that retains most of the features of earlier all steel Kahr models. The major differences are a longer slide and barrel upper, as well as a longer butt. It appears to be of the same thickness as earlier guns. But when you increase the gun's overall length by approximately an inch and lengthen the butt to take an eight shot single column magazine, you create a full size service pistol that's a bit on the skinny side.

If you don't know what a ""PISTON DRIVEN AR"" is....you need to do your homework.

REVIEWS BY ADVANCED WEAPONS:
 First field test of the SR556- Sheridan, Wyoming. Ruger factory sponsored prairie dog hunt. We were privileged to attend the hunt, and an Impact employee was the first to take an animal with the SR556 rifle!

 Function and reliability were 100%. The dog town we were shooting at had dogs out to 360 yards. All ranging was done using the new Ziess 8x binoculars with range and holdover function. Even with a low 10x scope, dogs were taken all the way out to 361 yards. Very impressive for any rifle, and even more so for a carbine!

 We were shooting Hornady TAP ammo, 55g, loaded into the P-Mags that are included with each rifle. Effect on the targets was devastating. Multiple hits and complex gymnastics by the dogs were the norm.

 All in all, our experience with the SR556 was beyond our expectations. The gas system gives the gun a softer recoil that a standard gas AR, and the chamber/bolt area was much cleaner that a gas AR. This SR556 is a keeper, and a really good value with all the good kit that is part of the base rifle.

 We have sold literally hunderds of the Ruger SR556 rifles. They are incredibly reliable and several of our customers report that even after thousands of rounds (some without cleaning) they have not experienced a single malfunction! 

If you don't know what a ""PISTON DRIVEN AR"" is....you need to do your homework.
Piston AR's are more Reliable, Cleaner and Smoother Shooting!

It's a beautiful weapon for sure. I've loved shooting it. 

The only mod I made was the pistol grip, but I still have the original pistol grip in case you want everything to be as it was. You also have the owners manual, the sling, the 5 round magazine, and 3x aftermarket 30 round magazines. You also get the gun case for it and about 100 rounds of quality brass ammo (not the crappy surplus or steel ammo). 

It shoots like a dream. For those that don't know, these are amongst the highest quality AK's you can get. These were built in Egypt, but the factory was set up by the Russians, so everything is up to spec of the original AK's.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!"

And buying at these prices is only EMPOWERING the GOUGERS and destroying what once was an amazing site... STOP THE INSANITY PLEASE... I urge you to be fair and reasonable to your fellow firearms ethusiast. We need to stick together and put an end to this madness... DO NOT PAY RIDICULOUS PRICES PEOPLE!!!

It has a flat top upper with a Diamond Head rear flip up sight and a standard front post. The rifle was given to me as a Christmas gift and was never used. It was only removed from the box a couple times just to fondle. It is so new the magazine has never been inserted and is still the in original wrapper. Includes all original paperwork and packaging (cardboard shipping box, hard plastic carrying case, warranty card, etc). I also have a box of new ammo which I will include (200 rounds) since this is the only .223 I have and don’t plan needing it. 

The price is very firm and I will only sell face to face to an Ohio resident with proof of ID. Please only contact me if know what this is and you plan to buy. In other words, I can’t drive around “showing” it to potential buys who just want to see it (that happened a lot when I sold something here a year ago, so sorry). It is exactly as described and factory new. Please do research on the web before asking questions that are better answered by people who know more about ARs than I do. These seem to sell all day long on gunbroker for 1500 dollars without the rear flip up sight and ammo. I think for the price it is as good a deal as you can find."

Up for sale is an HK FMP SLG95 HK91 assembled by Investment Grade Firearms. These are licensed by HK, and the quality most say is above that of the original HK91s. IGF is the top name in HK rifle builds, and this one shows why. The new owner will also receive the original build letter from IGF dated 09/05/01. This has been fired under 100 times, is in excellent condition and functions flawlessly.

Includes telescoping HK stock, wood stock, bayonet and sheath, 10- 20 Round HK G3 Magazines, 4-20 round Thermold Magazines, 3-20 Round CETME Magazines. It currently has a HK Navy trigger group with a Bill Springfield trigger job installed and also includes an original steel trigger group.

Please note the H&K Navy trigger group in the pictures shows the clipped ears that fit onto the semi auto receiver. The ""pin"" in place is a pair of plastic caps to only simulate the appearance of the original configuration. This is a Semi Auto receiver only. Please keep in mind this is one of the rifles that will be illegal to purchase if Feinstein gets her way. This is your chance to have a quality rifle that last for a long time at a great price.

$445.00 
Pick up the new Winchester® SXP shotgun and experience the light weight, centered balance and instant pointability firsthand. The Super X design provides you with the fastest follow-up shots. No other pump offers the feeling of an inertia-assisted slide-action that can deliver three shots in a half second.
THE WORLD’S FASTEST PUMP ACTION.
Whether its super-speed clays or fast-flushing upland game, keep up with shooting’s fastest action with the Super X Pump, the perfect choice for pump shotgun lovers. Because of its inertia-assisted slide-action, it’s the fastest in the world for follow-up shots. Three shots can be delivered in just a half second. Cycle one through and see if it’s not the finest fitting, sweetest handling and fastest pump out there.
ROTARY BOLT
Four massive lugs provide support, strength and solid lockup in the receiver of the lightning-fast Super X® Pump. Under recoil the mass of your body begins to slow the rearward travel of the shotgun, while the inertia of the bolt, slide and forearm continue cycling the action to help you get a head start on your next shot. Dual steel action guide bars channel and eliminate twisting, binding, wasted time and energy when cycling the action.
BLACK CHROME PROTECTION
Better than conventional bluing, black chrome finishes stand up to years of wear and last longer. Parts and surfaces are easier to clean and stay cleaner.
INFLEX RECOIL PAD
Recoil absorption is critical on any shotgun, and the new Super X® Pump has the best pad made. Rib structures inside the pad help direct and channel the recoil impulse, moving the comb down and away from your cheek. A hard heel insert on the pad makes mounting the Super X Pump snag free."

Never fired or chambered, new in box, Colt LE6920 .223/5.56 (can shoot either caliber), muzzle compensator, bayonet lug, 2 factory 20rd mags, 16.1"" barrel, bore chromed, 6 grooves, 1-7"" RH twist (good for 55 grain light bullets), adjustable sights, removable carry handle reveals picatinny rail that can be used for scope mounts, and a direct gas system means low recoil.

CATCH - I will NOT sell to just anyone, therefore you will encounter a $30 charge (in addition to the sale price) to go through an FFL. You can pick one, or use mine (only avail Tues-Fri, sometimes Mondays). This means you will pay me (see payment methods below) at the FFL (you will walk away immediately with the ammo) fill out the background check, and pay the FFL $30 when your check comes back. Be aware, there is a 6-7 day lag on checks right now, so the FFL will hold your gun during this time. Sorry, that's just the way it is (similar procedure as to buying in an online auction, or even from a dealer locally). If you want to bypass the background check you'll need to go elsewhere.

Payment - Cash for local, see below for shipping
NO CERTIFIED CHECKS, NO MONEY ORDERS for local.

If this ad is still up, chances are it's still available.

Want it shipped? USPS money orders only. When the money order clears (just have to call with the MO #, immediate clearance), I will ship to your FFL (must email me FFL info, or include with MO). No cashiers checks or other money orders taken in case of shipping.

This is a gun that needs a new blueing job. I have never fired it but mechanically it seems to work fine.The stock is in great shape but the metal has some spots and needs some attention. If you are a gunsmith or looking to try your hand a t fixing up a gun this will be a good project. I got it a couple of years ago in an estate sale and was going to try my hand at reblueing it but never got around to it. Trades considered but no bp or archery. Thanks for looking.
