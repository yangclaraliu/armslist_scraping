Carbon 15 receivers are 40% lighter and 40% stronger than aircraft aluminum. Occasionally you may see an add where some folks say that aluminum forged receivers are stronger than the composites but that is not so. Many weapons are going to many composite materials these days just as our military is going to composites in aircraft, land vehicles, and vessels. Composites are strong, light, and require less maintenance. This Bushmaster Carbon 15 is very light and comfortable when you shoulder the weapon and still has barely noticeable felt recoil. That is something to consider if you plan on using and carrying the weapon for any length of time. 300 rds 5.56 tracer ammo comes with weapon.

It is brand new without a single shot through it. The Nikon Inline XR BDC 300 3-9x40 scope was mounted in a Durasight QD mount system and bore sighted before I put it in the safe.

It will come with everything it did when I bought it. 

The Knight Mountaineer has a 27” fluted Green Mountain barrel for extreme accuracy. Each barrel has been hand treated with a ceramic-based bore coating that increases velocity and reduces the need to swab between shots. Every bolt and bolt handle on a Mountaineer is individually machined, not cast, and then finished with detailed jeweling and intricate knurling, providing a touch of class to an ignition system that is easy to use and clean.

This specimen is bored and chambered in 36 caliber. Since no one has ever located one, it was presumed that they were never made in this caliber. The Volcanic Pistol/Rifle however, is often found in 36 caliber, which has kept alive the controversy over the question; why did they make a rifle and a rifle/pistol with detachable shoulder stock in the 36 caliber, and not bother to use the same tooling to make the Navy pistol in 36 caliber (since they bothered to make them in all the other calibers). The answer to that has only recently been revealed with the discovery of this 36 caliber specimen. At first mistaken to be a replica, the previous owners/sellers have volunteered the latest information. This gun was originally found as parts, in a bin where more of the same were stored, in varying states of rough castings, unfinished and finished parts and assemblies, in the 1950's. These surplus parts lots were cobbled together into about 20 finished pieces and sold to collectors. Among them were a few 36 caliber specimens. An affidavit with all the details accompanies this auction piece and it includes the involvement of the most famous antique gun dealer in history, BANNERMAN's. On the top flat of the 8"" octagon barrel assembly, it is clearly marked, ""THE VOLCANIC REPEATING ARMS CO PATENT NEW HAVEN CONN FEB. 14, 1854."" Overall length is 15"". Fine walnut grips, fully functional, bored and chambered for the 36 caliber rocket ball ammunition. The main spring seems weak, unfired condition throughout. It's not just an antique gun for sale here, it's a missing link which, with this affidavit, answers the question of why no Volcanic Navy pistols in 36 caliber have been found...until now. Own a legend and make history with it. Sold as-is, with affidavit. All original and complete, ship weight is 5 pounds. 60 day layaway is available. Credit cards welcome plus 4% and must be pre-approved in advance, due to the size of the potential charge.

Low miles...just hit the 2,000 mark. Always winterized by a shop before storage each season inside a cargo container or the garage.

The snowmobile is currently on consignment at a shop in Marlboro, VT. I'm starting to see some interest coming in. It might go fast for the cash price I'm asking ($1600). Get in touch with me soon if you are interested. If the ad is still up, I still have it.

Shop installed bar-risers with the cable lengthen kit. Having the handle bars up a few inches like this is a must if you like to stand up through the bumps.

It looks a little dirty in the photos from being stored and the trailer ride. I'll get it cleaned up before you come to see it.

I can't think of anything wrong with this machine, except maybe that the windshield had some stickers on it and they have been removed. Some of the sticker residue was left behind. You might be able to clean it off with the right product, or, I think a new windshield is under $100.

I'm sorry, but if you pass up a deal like this, then you missed it big time! These are brand new with top of the line products that have been added to the mix to make these sell like hotcakes and so far people only care about .223 caliber AR-15. .22LR is deadly from 300yds and this has been proven more than once. If the worst should happen, would you rather have something that carries the same amount of ammunition and has less recoil giving you the better chance of putting your shots on target from a range more suitable to a home invasion than 300yds plus accuracy. Rounds are cheaper and easier to get a hold of at reasonable prices currently. Don't wait until they are selling for as much or more than the bigger ones when they run out. A .22LR is almost the same size as a .223 round for those that don't know this already. Velocity is the main difference. Last chance before I trade for a GSG5-PK"

Practically new (under 100 rounds of 9mm through it).  Includes barrels, recoil springs, and extractors for 9mm and .22 TCM.

PLEASE READ: I had this previously listed as for sale or trade and received TONS of interest.  Clearly this is in demand, as it is practically new and .22TCM is awesome.  I apologize to those of you who contacted me without a response.  I was overwhelmed with interest, but was looking for a trade.

If I don't get a good trade offer in the next few weeks I will probably just hang onto it.  Or, if you want to offer serious cash (over $600), I guess I would be forced to consider that.  I've had so much interest at $600 that I know it could get more than that.  Please no stupid offers at pawn shop rates, and don't ask me to trade this and $900 for some gun that is worth $900 anyway.  

I have a new AR-15 stripped lower receiver and a I could add in for the right trade.  Also a Thompson Center youth HotShot .22 rifle with matching scope.  http://www.tcarms.com/firearms/firearmDetails.php?ID=3400 

Pictures here: http://imgur.com/a/s45Xz#0 

If you do not know about .22 TCM, it is made by Armscor and shoots 2000-2200 feet per second.  Will penetrate 1/4"" steel at 50 yards.  Much like the FN 5.7.

I bought it because I thought I wanted a 9mm 1911, but I've since changed my mind.  I will stick with my Glocks.  This gun did not malfunction for me at all with 9mm...  no failure to feed  or extract.  I have not fired any .22 TCM through it.  Comes with the original factory mag.  

I paid $650 a month ago for this handgun.  Willing to negotiate for an interesting deal.

Includes all orginal documentation, including Colt welcoming letter.  Anacondas are no longer made by Colt (since 1999) and are rapidly becoming collectors items, along with all other Colt double-action revolvers.  

USED Anacondas are going for $1,800.00 and + on GunBrokers.com.  You will find no unfired ones anywhere on their site and any other site.  Suspect a new unfired one in perfect condition would be going for MUCH more?

Also comes with 140 rounds of .222 Remington.
Has a 1:14 twist, which prefers the 55gr loads, and fires milsurp 5.56 well.
Valued around $859.
Only reason I'm wanting to trade is because of the craziness for .223 at this time, and I just picked up another bolt action, so the rifle fills a role I have filled in other ways.
Very little interest in cash, just trades. 


I also have an Mtech crossbow rated at 80 lbs, if I recall. It's all set up, and hardly used. Shoulder injury doesn't allow me to use it anymore. The bolts for it have been lost in a move, so the $100 dollar value is closer to $75.
Not expecting to get much for it, just hoping it can sweeten a trade.

I value my privacy, so if I don't get back to you anytime after 4PM, I'm not interested in your trade. I just don't want to send my email out to people I don't want to do business with.

One of the earliest cartridge Colts known to exist and now on the market...having Serial number #2004. U.S. Marked. Comes from Lot 2 issued in 1873  This is an EXCEDDINGLY RARE piece of history, Issued to 6th cavalry to fight the Native Americans ""Possibly Little Big Horn"" Custer colt. This gun locks up and indexes perfect and has been tested with blanks. The fact that the barrell was cut to non-standard length is strong evidence it was taken by the Native Americans during a battle and modified as this was the common practice. As well as the holster having a strong Native influence hand made as well as the knife. The handle was checkered likely by a simple knife probably sitting around a camp fire back in the day. Having the badge from 6th cavalary also suggest it was taken by Natives after a kill as this was common to use for trade goods as well as a battle keep-sake to show bravery within the tribe. This gun was used!!! And if it could talk. 
The gun was taken to an expert smith and the screws were replaced during the cleaning and initial repair, but the original screws are now back in the gun. The gun was plum colored from age and after inspection and cleaning was put back to plum to preserve the original color..
The John Kopec letter states the history of this gun with much detail and John Kopec is the worlds leading colt expert having devoted his life to the study of this period colt revolver.

I have for sale here the mag clear-outs from four mags from a CETME rifle that I no longer own. (Mags are long gone as well..)
The twenty rounds per mag held a total of 80 rounds. There  are two variety of .308 in this lot, with a total of 40 rounds of each type/manufacture.

40 rounds of Australian Defence Industries ammo
40 rounds of Winchester .308 commercial ammo

This ammo came out of my former mags, and thus may have marks or scratches but is brand new, unfired, original manufacture without the original packaging. This ammo has been in mags stored in a sealed USGI ammo can for approx 2 years.

.308/7.62x51 in my exp  generally costs about a dollar a round / $20 for a box of 20, and the Australian Defense ammo is generally all in private hands at this point (whatever of its unfired)

Since this is not in retail packaging, I will sell this batch of 80 rounds for 40 Bucks - cash only, which is half the retail price. 
I will not ship this due to USPS being unable to carry ammo shipments so you will need to meet me in the O'hare area with a FOID card to purchase."

No trades, face to face only. I prefer to do business with a CCW holder, so if you have one, note it in your email. I will take the ad down promptly upon sale.
