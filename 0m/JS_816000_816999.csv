All numbers match.  I own a number of AK-47s, both rifles and pistols. I did extensive homework and research on each and every AK I own prior to purchasing them. This pistol was by far the one I looked into the most. I owed two Draco Romanian and had very little knowledge of the Zastava M-92. It did not take long to realize this pistol was a quality machine with outstanding reviews. After looking at one in person it was quite obvious that it was a far superior AK pistol than my Draco and most of my AKs. My Arsenal is the only one compatible.  Most AKs tend to fit loose and sloppy with little attention to detail. This Zastava M-92 is perfectly fitted and tight everywhere. The only complaint with them is the furniture comes very plain with no finish and often dirty which as you can see I paid a nice chunk to have mine totally refinished in Russian Red. Zastava is Serbian and considered to be one of the best AK makers if not the best period. All their products are quality and the M 92 pistols are made new in Serbia. She has had two 30 round mags ran through her the day I got her. Unbelievable performance and extremely accurate. The following day I had her torn down and rebuilt.
The Zastava PAP M-92 was taken all the way down and each part was surprisingly well finished but not good enough for me. Each piece and component was hand worked and polished, then washed in an acid solution to remove all micro shavings.  Rivets replaced with a much more superior rivet. The furniture was taken all the way down and redone in Russian Red Wood and a built proof clear coat given for an amazingly tough and beautiful finish.  The pistol grip was coated in a rubberized coating for exceptional gripping as was one of the new TapCo mags.  She comes with 24 new 30 round magazines and one 40 round mag for 25 total. 15 of those are new or restored high quality Easter Block steel mags. There are a few very rare Romanian mags from 1964 that have been restored like new. The other 10 are a variation of new TapCo 30 round mags.  She comes with just over 1800 rounds of quality and fresh 7.62x39 ammo some of that can be seen in the photos. I have a few mags loaded with very high end penetration hollow points.  All mags in the photos are full for a total of just over 1700 rounds total.
If you just want an AK then this might not be the one for you. If you are looking for the perfect AK performance and cosmetically as well as superior quality then this is something worth looking into. She is a beautiful beast!

Thank you for taking the time to look. Serious buyers interested in a quality custom AK only please."

I will also throw in 1 30-round magazine that I bought used from a guy on Reno 4x4.  It's a Triple-K steel magazine.

I bought this rifle from Larry's during the AWB. Big John picked it out for me, and it has great rifling, and will eat even the cheapest Chinese .308s reliably. It has the post-ban brake that does a good job of eliminating recoil but ain't much of a flash hider.  It also makes the rifle loud to the shooter. It has a homemade woodland finish that has served me well enough while its been my truck gun on the farm.  I have three twenty round mags and one five round (hunting legal) mag, a German G3 double mag pouch, and the sling that's on it. Lighter than a M1A or a STG58. Extra 20 rd mags cost less than $10, and I've seen them at cheaperthandirt for less than $4.

Classes in Belvidere and Freeport. 

We are giving to all Illinois (or Wisconsin) Residents, the Utah Concealed Carry Permit Class.   Illinois' ban on Concealed Carry was just overturned and they have until June 10th to pass a new law.  That law will go into effect within 6 -18 months following the passed legislation.   Until that day, the only way to get a concealed carry permit is by holding a non resident permit from another state. 

By obtaining the Utah Permit, you will be able to carry in 34 states total, including every state that borders Illinois, this means that you can carry a concealed firearm when you come to Wisconsin.   Having the Utah permit will also most likely give you the advantage over non-permit holders when the Illinois law goes into effect, as you will be excused from more training and will get your ability to carry in Illinois faster.   For more details, please call me. 

The training dates, times, locations & costs are below.  MUST REGISTER!

Brand new never fired and in perfect condition. Comes with hard case, manual, oil, spacers for drop and cast adjustment, 2 chokes (full & IC), and choke wrench. 

This gun is brand new, never fired.  I purchased it about 3 weeks ago, and want to sell it so I can buy the left handed version of the same gun for my son.  I really like this model, but didn’t realize they make a left handed version when I bought it.  The store will not take it back so I have to sell it rather than exchange it.   I do not have the cardboard box it came in, so I am including a hard case.  Yes stores do sell these for $1000 but most stores are out of them and they are back ordered until at least the end of February.   With all the interests in new gun restrictions since the New Town shooting stores have sold out most guns.  Since this gun has never been fired I think it is fair to ask the original price.  That said, I would be willing to knock $50 off the price to $950.  You would also be saving the tax and shipping cost if you live locally.  

Product description: Light, slender, and quick-pointing never described a semi-auto better than the Benelli Montefeltro 12-gauge shotgun. The Inertia Driven® system in these Benelli shotguns requires no springs or gas cylinder under the forend. That allows the Montefeltro’s forend to be slim and graceful, while the lightweight, anodized aluminum receiver keeps weight to a minimum. The 12-gauge shotgun are chambered for 3"" magnum loads, making the Montefeltro equally at home in New England woodcock cover and a Louisiana duck blind. This is one gun that looks as good as it shoots. Stocked with beautifully finished satin walnut, the Montefeltro is the gun for the wingshooting purist who wants the feel of a classic game gun with the added advantage of a semi-auto.

SPECIAL NOTES:
not looking for trades, i just need the cash, im open to best offers though, im not making any profit on this but i should charge more.
but pls before you submit a less-than-reasonable offer, keep in mind that this is not just a plain tactical version, its a tactical ""tri-rail"" special purpose version plus a few extras and ammo, and i'm selling everything as a whole package, plus i'm in no rush to get rid of this so i'm 99.9% firm on the price. the 0.01% is left for wiggle room on the price depending on negotiation. i just don't have time for the range anymore & i don't really hunt thats why it's just collecting dust. i have other guns for self/home defense but nothing beats a racking sound of a 12 guage pump. 
i will not ship, i prefer to sell locally and will drive or meet halfway depending on distance. so if you live far away, it's your responsibility to come to me.
No BSing me please! as of 1-10-2013, this specific item is out-of-stock everywhere. you might get lucky at a local gun shop in a remote area somewhere.  trust me, i've done the research myself. there might be a cheaper one out there but i'm sure it's a lower-end model. even thru the manufacturer, they have zero instock w/o a backorder option. that means, distributors and dealers can't get this yet and have to wait. if you want it, let's make a deal. if you don't want it, dont waste my time. if your unsure, think about it 1st then contact me. again, i've heard all the negotiation tactics like ""they sell it for $100 less online"", ""it's used"", ""would you take $$lowball$$"", ""magtube capacity"", ""barrel length""...etc. but you know what, there's a new gun-control law and assault weapons ban coming soon so better hurry up! So pls., serious inquiries only. if you don't have the money, you are not ready for this weapon or this is not for you. if you can't afford it, just get a maverick88.

We are giving to all Illinois (or Wisconsin) Residents, the Utah Concealed Carry Permit Class.   Illinois' ban on Concealed Carry was just overturned and they have until June 10th to pass a new law.  That law will go into effect within 6 -18 months following the passed legislation.   Until that day, the only way to get a concealed carry permit is by holding a non resident permit from another state. 

By obtaining the Utah Permit, you will be able to carry in 34 states total, including every state that borders Illinois, this means that you can carry a concealed firearm when you come to Wisconsin.   Having the Utah permit will also most likely give you the advantage over non-permit holders when the Illinois law goes into effect, as you will be excused from more training and will get your ability to carry in Illinois faster.   For more details, please call me. 

The training dates, times, locations & costs are below.  MUST REGISTER!

The Saiga-12 self-loading smooth bored shotgun is intended for professional and sport hunting of small-and medium-size game under any climatic conditions. This shotgun is built on the famous AK-47 action that has been proven by years of very reliable combat action! The shotgun comes with 12-ga. smooth bored barrel and the chamber which accepts the ammo equipped with shot or slugs including ""Magnum"" cartridges with 70mm (2-3/4"") and 76 mm (3"") cartridge case. The shotgun is used to deliver single shots. It is reloaded automatically due to the energy of powder combustion gases bled from the barrel bore through the barrel port. The shotgun may be equipped with a sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation, which makes zeroing and firing at moving targets more convenient. The gas motive unit is adjustable to match the parameters of internal ballistics inherent to the standard cartridges and ""Magnum"" cartridges, as well."

Whereas, the Bill of Rights added further declaratory and restrictive clauses to the U.S. Constitution in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers; and

Whereas, those further declaratory and restrictive clauses relate directly to the fundamental rights of individuals, including the sweeping declaratory Ninth and Tenth Amendments, which guarantee that powers not delegated by the people to the United States in the Constitution and those powers not granted to the separate states were reserved to the people; and

Whereas, history demonstrates convincingly that the first act of tyrannical governments in expanding their powers beyond those granted to them is to disarm or short arm individuals so as to render them defenseless against the state’s heavily armed police and soldiery; and

Whereas, the authors of the first ten amendments included the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights because they understood this lesson of history and consequently believed as a matter of fact that a well-armed citizenry is both a necessary condition of liberty and the only effective deterrent against tyranny; and

Whereas, there is a plethora of evidence confirming these facts in the writings and statements of the Founders—including the author of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, and the Father of the Constitution, James Madison, as well as in numerous other documents and writings contemporary of the Founding of the United States; and

Whereas, these writings and statements also demonstrate conclusively that the authors of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights believed as a matter of philosophy that every human being possesses an inalienable, fundamental, natural right, which pre-dates the Second Amendment, to own and bear arms and, if necessary, to use those arms in self defense, including self defense against tyrannical government agents, police forces and armies that would over step their proper bounds; and

Whereas, George Mason, the Father of the Bill of Rights, summed it up best when he said, “To disarm the people is the best and most effectual way to enslave them;” and

Whereas, the Second Amendment was designed specifically to prevent the people’s enslavement by guaranteeing that individuals not only would retain the right and means to defend themselves against private outlaws who would do them harm but also to provide individuals an effective deterrent against and a means to defend themselves against tyrannical and oppressive governments and their agents acting improperly under the color of law; and 

Whereas, the Second Amendment was and remains an unambiguous and unrestricted, sweeping guarantee of individuals’ right to own and bear arms and use them in their own self defense; now

Therefore, We the Undersigned petition the United States Government to cease and desist all efforts to disarm or short-arm the American people by limiting and disparaging the Second Amendment or rendering it a dead letter through federal legislation, interpretation and regulation."

I don't have any and i'm not trying to sell any but just to REALLY set the record straight, not all walmarts have the tula ammo. TYPICALLY they sell a case for 250 dollars , but the price went up TODAY. You will not find it for the regular price, as the walmarts start to change the price line. Second of the 10 walmarts within a 50 mile radius of frederick colorado TWO had the ammo in stock and ONE had quantity. Third and finally, Hillary just signed a trade embargo on russian gun related goods, banning the import of of all russian made fire arm goods, that means guns parts and yes TULA ammo. So what is here is here and there will not be any more. I just thought that everyone would be interested. Yes its cheap, yes it is steel cased, but there will be no more and there for sure will not be many more for 250$$. That is the way it is .

This is a great little .380 ACP pistol. I bought it for my wife but she didn't care for it, so I'm selling it. This gun is in near perfect condition. There isn't a blemish in the blueing, barrel is bright and clean, gun operates flawlessly (fired maybe 100 rounds through it), everything is clean and oiled, etc. It comes with everything you see in the pictures, original box, safety, key, (3) 13 round magazines and a cleaning brush.
If you are looking for a cost effective, high-capacity, smooth shooting, .380 ACP, this is your gun. Most .380 ACP's are small, painful to shoot, are only single stack and hold 5-8, etc. This is the best of the best when it comes to a nice .380 ACP pistol, and Beretta makes phenomenal guns.
