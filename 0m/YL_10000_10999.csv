The first I have is Hornady .223. This is the TAP training ammo. It works perfect in my AR-15 (bushy). I have bout alot of this stuff, and it is what I Shoot most. I have some extra boxes, and need to rearrange the gun collection. I have put aside 200 rounds for sell, each in 50rd boxes. This ammo has worked well in my standard bushy 16"" patrolman barrel.

I am asking for $25/box of 50 rounds, or take the whole 4 boxes for $85



The second ammo I am selling is Wolf. You know this ammo... This ammo has given me much pain over the past year. It started when my buddy bought a bunch of wolf, and it ran flawless in his rifle. I was there, saw him shoot a couple hundred rounds of it, and listening to him say how much he saved by buying this stuff. So, going against what I usually do (buy the best I can afford) I bought 200 rounds of Wolf. My bushy hates it. I get a failure to feed every mag or two. I get about 3+ jams per beta-mag. This isn't acceptable to me. But that was my rifle. Like I said, my buddy's rifle ate it up. I've seen Oly AR15's shoot this without issue at the range. Something about my rifle hates it. I know a bunch of people on AR15.com who swear by this stuff, and it sells. Gander has raised their price on this ammo considerably. Don't buy it from Gander though, I'll sell you the rest of this ammo I have, 50 rounds loose for $18. They were previously loaded in Pmags, but I have taken them out and counted them. 
You can count for yourself if you are interested. I know this rifle works for some people, just not me. This is the new stuff by the way, not the corrisive Wolf. I've always stayed away from corrosive ammo.

Good condition inside and out, though the wood furniture is not exactly color matched (curable with some Minwood stain I should think, if anyone cares).  Has a black sporter grip, a green adjustable sling, and a cleaning kit inside the shoulder stock. Accepts all AK mags, and includes three thirty-round mags and one five-round waffle mag.  $650.

FA-91 made by Federal Arms Corp.  This is an HK-91 clone chambered in .308 Win and fixed with a TechView 3-9x50 scope.  Internal parts are genuine, HK-stamped parts. The barrel has an integrated muzzle break and the receiver has an integrated rail.  I have not zeroed the scope yet.  This is a very good battle rifle, but it crimps the brass on ejection, making it unusable by any enemy who finds it, but unfortunately also rendering it unsuitable for reloading.  Includes ten 20-round original G3 mags, five of which are graded as ""B"" condition (age, some wear) and five of which are ""C"" condition, but all function well.  $900 includes all items described.  For +$100, I'll add 200rds of .308 ammo since it may be scarce in your stores.  Ammo will not be sold alone.

Bushmaster XM15-E2S commonly called an AR-15.  This gun has been fired fewer than 400 times, is in outstanding condition and can be purchased with buyer's choice of several options.  The current configuration is as follows:
Realtrees© ""Hardwood"" camo stock set and grip with matching padded sling.  Trijicon night sights.  Yes, single dot on front post and two dots on rear peep, make dim light acquisition much easier.  Stainless steel 20"" barrel with attached but removable muzzle break.  Bayonet and scabbard.  Note that the original owner did a poor job when sharpening it - effectively removing all of the case hardening.  It'll still get the job done, but it's not pretty.  Rifle has a ""softened recoil"" stock spring/plunger installed. Original owner's manual, original cleaning kit (can be placed into shoulder stock).  Includes one 5-round Bushmaster mag, two 10-round Bushmaster mags and three 20-round after-market mags.  Also comes with original Bushmaster hard case. Price $1350 but you can add ( + ) or subtract ( - ) for options listed here:
 With standard ""black"" barrel ( - $100 ) gun will ship with original black barrel for buyer to install, gun will be sent without barrel installed.
 Original dark grey stock set ( - $50 ) rifle will come with stock vs camo furniture and I'll send a dark sling instead of the camo sling.
 Original spring/plunger (no cost change) - I will install original set.
 Additional set of two 30-round mags with green followers ( + $45 )
 Standard front/rear sights ( - $50 ) installed in place of the trijicon night sights.
This is an awesome, near new rifle that comes very well ""accessorized.""

Original Thunder 5 revolver chambered for either 45 Long Colt or .410 shotshells !!  Copied by others as ""the Judge"" and various names, but this was the first and best.  Affectionately called the ugliest revolver around, but rock solid with full parkerized finish.  Has 2"" rifled barrel, so it will also shoot shotgun slugs.  Excellent condition and comes with original hard case. $550 includes 250 rounds of .45LC ammo.

Very small loss of bluing on the left end of the barrel (pea sized) from sitting in a holster too long (previous owner). This gun dates to 1980. It is P&R. Also included is a very nice Bianchi leather holster. The stocks are pristeen and show absolutely no wear. No wear anywhere else on the gun...looks brand spanking new. Face to face buyer gets some ammo as well (Magtech cowboy loads, 30 rounds or so). The chambers mic in the middle range somewhere. They're not super tight, but aren't as loose as many of the 25-5's. This gun is a good shooter. I can re-mic and send you that information upon request. Target trigger, hammer, red ramp front, white outline rear. No box, no tools.

I recently took it apart, cleaned and oiled it, and put it back together which lightened the trigger pull and improved the hammer mechanics, which was hitting soft occasionally.  It still hits soft once in awhile in double action, but in single action soft-strikes are FAR, far less common, but do occur once in awhile.  

It's a good plinker, practice gun, or first pistol for someone who needs to learn about firearms.  Because of its small size and unintimidating caliber, it's perfect for teaching women how to shoot.

Installed a set of TacStar Pistol grip stock and pistol grip forearm, with rubber molded grip. I also installed a Tacstar 6 shot side. The Safety lever was replaced with a steel lever for durability. A heat shield from a Persuader was also installed. Also i added a rail for a tactical light or laser that is reachable from the forarm pistol grip. The shotgun was then covered in Armorcoat, black semi gloss, again at H&H Gunrange in Oklahoma City, Ok. I absolutely love shooting this creation. Brings a smile to my face every time!!! You hold it ""tommy gun style"" and its accurate enough for what it was intended for, and that was to clear a room, and quick. I built it for a home security shotgun and its intimidation factor speaks for itself. If you would like pictures, just ask.

Its a 58 Mil Springfield with a unique USGI Marlin Barrel. From what I have gathered Marlin barrels were used for awhile on SA Garands when SA was having trouble with their barrels. Later Marlins were used a replacement barrels which I believe this is.
Stock has very nice graining with a few dings and small gouges, no cracks. Handgaurds are in same condition.
No stampings on the USGI stock ,which is normal for a arsenal replacement 
Has National Match Op Rod, remainder of parts are a assortment of Springfield parts
There is some wear to the parkerizing on the edges or corners and to the gas cylinder as expected from use. Absolutly no rust or pitting .
I have completely stripped the rifle ,cleaned and greased, replaced Op Rod spring and clip ejector spring.
Rifle functions perfectly. I have collected Garands for years and have inspected this one and know it to be clear and free of any problems
Barrel is next to new with a Muzzle Wear of less than one. It measures .50 on my gauge. Couldnt have very many rds through it since the rebarrel.
I bought this rifle from a private owner so I dont know the history behind it. It is not a Import and could have come from CMP at one time
Nothing CMP has now compares to this Garand as far as condition of the barrel. Nothing they offer has this low barrrel wear unless you get a new commercial barrel
This is a very nice Garand, you would have a hard time finding one as nice as this and with a barrel with such little wear
If you want a Garand that is mechanically perfect this is it,. It will be a great shooter for you and whoever you pass it down to.
It needs nothing but ammo I may be able to help in that department also.

Barrel length - 7""
Magazine capacity - 10 rounds

This is a heavy barrel target pistol. The sights are adjustable and the barrel rib is also a rail for mounting optics.  Pistol is in good shape, I fired it very little. The recoil spring is new - the original one flew off to parts unknown during cleaning.

The pistol works well, but has trouble with some of the cheap bulk pack ammo. Occasionally a cartridge would be underloaded and the slide does not go back far enough to get the momentum to snap the extractor over the rim. Using high velocity or better quality ammo fixes this problem.

The pistol comes with factory case, three magazines, manual, and a chamber flag.

I would like to see a valid Permit To Purchase or a Permit To Carry (that means it has a current photo ID with it) and will write up a bill of sale on request."

She is not strong enough (4'11"" 90lbs) to pull back the slide with comfort. I purchased this firearm earlier this year from the estate of an retired WPD police Captain. I was told by his family that this was purchased new sometime in the late 70's and if it had 3-4 boxes fired they would be surprised. This gun was stored in the officers personal vehicle much of its life until one day the youngest boy took it out of the glove box and proceeded to shoot a hole in the floor of his father's new truck. I was told from then on it was stored away inside the home until I purchased. I am selling this for what I purchased it for and that is $330. I have seen these listed local and on the internet anywhere from $295 in poor condition to $475 super nice like new. I think my asking price is very fair. This firearm comes with a holster and 2 magazines which are both factory Mauser. Firearm has very little wear if any of inner workings and barrel. Holster and storage wear as would be expected for a firearm 30+ years in age. Would make a nice small/mid carry firearm for someone. I would be interested in trades towards what might fit my mothers needs or something I desire which at this time would be something chambered in .44/.357 or a Glock product.

The V50SS-300 rifle features a massive SAE 4150 receiver and a three lug bolt with a 60-degree bolt throw, cock on opening action, a shell holder type extractor for absolutely positive extraction, and a machined aircraft grade aluminum stock. The barrel is machined from ordnance grade, chrome moly, high vanadium steel hardened to Rc 28-32. The barrel is 30"" long, has 8 grooves, 1-15"" right hand twist and features a SAAMI spec chamber which will allow the use of any SAAMI spec ammo. The barrel and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished for long lasting good looks and corrosion protection. The V50SS utilizes the time proven standard, '98 Mauser trigger system for absolute safety. This rifle also features a high efficiency ""shark fin"" muzzle break, machined from solid bar stock and threaded on to the muzzle of the barrel with 1-12 TPI threads. This muzzle break is designed to reduce felt recoil to that of a 12 ga. Shotgun. The muzzle break can be ""Tuned"" to the barrel by altering the length via the long thread shank. This feature allows the operator to find the ""sweet spot"" for the break that gives the best accuracy. An M1913 Picatinny scope rail is attached via oversized grade 8 allen screws for easy mounting of optics. The oversized recoil shoulder distributes the recoil over a large surface area affording rock solid mounting to the stock. The bolt has three huge locking surfaces and a 60 degree throw. It features a ""primary extraction"" cam for positive extraction of the case. The receiver is machined from bar stock SAE 4150 steel and features pressure release vents for BOTH case separation and primer pierce, making this one of the strongest, safest actions available. We have tested these actions and bolts to pressures exceeding 100,000 psi with no evidence of failure. The stock is machined from aircraft aluminum bar stock. This stock is made to machine tool tolerances and is completely impervious to climate and temperature. It is attached to an aluminum buttstock with a shock absorbing recoil to further reduce felt recoil and allow the shooter to comfortably shoot all day. A bipod mounting rod is threaded into the stock, securing the oversized recoil shoulder and locking the recoil shoulder to the stock for increased accuracy. The Specs on the rifle are: Overall Length: 52"" / 1321mm
Barrel Length: 30"" / 762mm
Barrel Twist: 1-15"" / 1/381mm, RH, 8 groove
Weight: 30.0 Lbs / 13.6 kg
