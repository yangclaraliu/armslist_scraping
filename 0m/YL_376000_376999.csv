The Mossberg 930 SPX Tactical has an aluminum receiver, a tactically sound 18.5” steel barrel, an extended magazine tube and a tough but lightweight synthetic stock. The gas-operated, semi-automatic shotgun is a direct descendant of the excellent Mossberg 930 hunting guns. The shared self-regulating gas operating system reduces recoil and eases stress on its components by venting whatever excess gas isn’t required to cycle the action.

The system uses two gas ports in the barrel to power a piston that surrounds the magazine tube under the barrel. The set-up gives the Mossberg a bit of a chunky for-end (to accommodate the moving parts), but nothing that looks out of place. The 930 SPX functions smoothly and reliably without a gas seal ring. An added bonus: the 930 SPX also field strips without a lot of drama."

Want to trade for a nice small 9mm. but just ask, I am open to a lot of trades.

Don't really want to sell, due to sentimental value (family owned gun). Would rather trade away. These guns go anywhere from $250 - $450 depending on condition. I rate mine at a 9.5 out of 10 (only because it has been shot before). so that means $400 to me. If you have the cash, its yours.

Official Product Description:

Night Vision: ITT Night Quest 260 Generation III Binocular

ITT has been the world leader in night vision equipment development since their inception in 1959 and are now the sole supplier to the U.S. Military. Proven by U.S. and Allied Forces in Operation Desert Storm, ITT's Generation 3 night vision products are light years ahead of the surplus Russian equipment being pawned at army surplus stores. 404 precision engineered processes go into the assembly and manufacturing of each viewer. Several features set ITT's products apart from anything else on the market. These are: a state-of-the-art image intensifier tube with their unique MCP (microchannel plate) which contains over 6,000,000 microchannels. Each channel is 20 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Covering the microchannel plate is a thin protective film that's less than 100 atoms thick. The phosphor screen has a resolution 20 times higher than the typical television set, and all night vision products are sealed under clean-room conditions in such an ultra-high vacuum state that no other manufacturer can compare. The end result is clarity and resolution unmatched by others.
Night Quest 250/260

Compact, lightweight and weather resistant, the 250/260 binocular is a vital visual aid for peace of mind. These units were tested to rigid military specifications and were used in Desert Storm. Ideal for search and rescue, security and recreation, the Night Quest comes in both G2 and G3 Models. Superior clarity and resolution even in extremely low-light conditions allows the Model 250/260 to capture even the slightest speck of starlight to provide excellent night-time viewing. Ruggedly constructed, water resistant and lightweight (26 ounces), the Model 250/260 is easy to handle and has automatic gain control and electronic focus. The units feature F/1.4 optics and a 40° field of view. Runs on a 6V lithium camera battery."

I am selling one of my 300 blackout uppers. It has a 16.5"" barrel which I have turned/profiled/chambered to tight/match specs. 1/10 twist. The outside of the barrel has been turned concentric to the bore. 

It has a low round count (under 350 rounds.) The muzzle end is not threaded, but I can single point thread it for 5/8x24 for 50.00 extra, if you want to attach a flash suppressor or silencer.

Included will be approx 500+ newly formed/trimmed brass to get you started. (About 100.00 extra value!)

With an acog scope, this is MOA capable if you do your part. (I always blame myself, rather than the gun.)
My favorite load is bulk 150gr FMJ millitary pulldowns, trimmed LC brass, 16.5gr H110 powder and federal SR primers.

I also can form 300 blk brass if you bring me CLEAN unsized .223 or 5.56 brass. Call me for availability as I do this when I'm not at work.

I've built several of these rifles, and can't really justify keeping all of them. Selling this will help me build new ones.

I finally got to test this sweet thing out yesterday. I compared it to a 2nd Gen Glock G23 and a 3rd Gen Glock G22. For the .40 call round this Steyr is a well made, smooth running machine. Doesn't have to normal ""POP"" of a .40 and has the best factory sights out there for fast target acquisition and follow up shots. Put's every shot where you want it at 25 yards. Magazine has 12 round capacity. Comes with box and paper work. I have two, but I'm keeping one for myself so first come first serve. Tac rail is flush with frame, every action is smooth and lock up and case support are unmatched in a striker fire configuration. If you've never had a chance to shoot one of these guns, I highly recommend you come check it out. Heck, if you bring/buy ammo, I'll even let you shoot it first. Call or text at REDACTED or email, no calls after 11pm. Has normal Glock trigger safety with an extra safety you can use or leave off. The extra safety sticks down in front of the trigger and can literally be clicked off with your trigger finger without moving your finger off the trigger. Slimmer and smoother than a glock, and built like a streamlined tank on the inside, this gun will be somebody's pride of their collection and a work-horse to boot. I'll even offer to Duracoat it one or two-colors for $75.00 with purchase.
