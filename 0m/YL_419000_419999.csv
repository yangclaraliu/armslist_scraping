Additional information about the Ruger LCP 380: http://www.ruger.com/products/lcp/index.html 
Weighing just 9.4 oz (266.5 g) this is Ruger's first entry into the field of tiny, ultra-light defensive pistols.[4] LCP stands for ""Lightweight Compact Pistol"" and was designed in direct response to customer requests for a compact firearm for use by police as a back-up, and as a defensive handgun for civilian concealed carry needs.[5]
The pistol has a glass-filled nylon frame, a two-finger grip, and a through-hardened blued steel slide. It is similar in appearance to the Kel-Tec P-3AT which weighs 8.3 oz. and uses a similar tension spring for the lightweight hammer, identical locked breech mechanism, and similar takedown method. The main differences are the Glock style extractor and the incorporation of an external slide stop. It is possible to tell if there is a round chambered by looking at the ""view hole"" next to the extractor
Additional information about the Laserlyte laser: http://www.laserlyte.com/products/ck-amf
LaserLyte answers the growing demand for lasers specific to the increasingly popular conceal carry market with the new Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser (CK-AMF). At half the cost of a leading competitor, the CK-AMF fits on the side of the Ruger LCP and the Kel-Tec .380 and .32. Easy to mount on the gun by simply pushing out and replacing the stock pins with the new screws (included).  Then push the ergonomic activation button with the index finger and the laser is on target. The CK-AMF design works also as a finger guide that allows for safe trigger control without blocking the laser beam. The programmable laser features a pulse or constant on mode and also has an auto-off function to prevent an unwanted battery drain. The side mounted laser allows the pistol to fit in virtually any nylon pocket holster. The new LaserLyte Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser is compact and light, and foremost – deadly.

Never thought I would sale this rifle, but as always I have found something else I would like to have. So up for grabs is a like new Bushmaster ACR Advance in black. Included is the original Magpul sights, Promag rail covers, Magpul AFG2, the original case, original Magpul magazine, and the original paper work. Also included is a like new Trijicon TA31H on a Larue LT100 mount. This set up aone was $1205 from Larue Tactical. Included with it will be the pelican case, all accessories, and all paper work. Im asking $2700 for the entire package. I will sale the sight seperate from the rifle but only if the rifle sales first. If you want just the rifle Im asking $1900, and for just the sight im asking $900. So you will be saving $100 if you buy the complete package. I might accept cash plus trades, but I need at least $2000 cash with any trade. Now onto the rifle. I know everyone has heard good things and bad thinds about the ACR. This particular one has had about 800 flawless rounds through it. Not one single malfunction, just as realiable as any other rifle I have. You will not be disappointed in this rifle. Low ballers need not even bother, It will not hurt me to keep this and I am not desperate for money. As long as the item Im wanting for sale is still avaliable ill leave this up, onnce its gone this will come down. Thanks and email me with any questions you may have."

Furthermore, the handguard has dual aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. Has a LMT tactical adjustable rear sight which offers a co-located sight picture to back up reflex sight systems. Adjustments match current M4-type operation both in function and capability. This rifle is the ultimate in AR-15 designs and I’m selling it at a steal. $1200. Has all the original Colt stamped parts."

Mark's Firearms is a proud distributor of Ballistol
Sportsman's Oil, once you use it, 
you will not want to use any other.

Notes:Many Uses

BALLISTOL dissolves traces of lead, copper, zinc, brass and tombac, which are used to make projectiles and jackets for them. Residues of these metals will remain in the bore of any firearms as a result of shooting jacketed or unjacketed lead projectiles. The use of BALLISTOL makes scraping or brushing the bore unnecessary. Just pour or spray enough into the barrel and chamber, turn the firearm around several times to allow the liquid to reach all parts and let it ""go to work"". Later, the residues will then completely be cleaned out.

Due to its alkaline character BALLISTOL is ideal for cleaning and maintaining black powder firearms. BALLISTOL eliminates the need for brutal mechanical scrubbing and aggressive solvents. 
Of course, you should also use BALLISTOL to treat your holsters, belts and carrying slings.

FIREARMS - Cleans & dissolves traces of copper, lead, brass, zinc, & tombac. Lubricates & protects firearms, lock, stock & barrel. Forms a film that protects against rust. Will never gum-up or harden. Ideal for pistol grips, & rifle stocks.

BLACK POWDER - Dissolves black powder residues. Emulsifies with water. Mildly alkaline, neutralizes acids. Excellent patch lube.

LEATHER - Use on boots, shoes, gloves, holsters, slings, & saddles. Protects leather against water. Keeps leather soft & pliable, will darken lighter colors. Do not use on suede.

KNIVES & TOOLS - Lubricates, cleans, & protects metal, plastic, rubber, & wood. Outstanding penetrating oil, creeps into the finest cracks, loosens nuts & bolts. Also use as a cutting/boring oil (20:1). 

MARINE - Use in motor compartments, on joints, links, wire pulls, & around battery terminals. Protects electrical contacts. Beautifies faded gel coats. Lubricates zippers, push buttons, & winches. Great for fishing rods, reels, & tackle. Protects Aluminum, prevents pitting.

Thompson Center 45cal Hawken Rifle
Thompson Center 36cal Hawken Rifle
All accessories to get you out shooting: Primers, Rounds, Powder, Wads, Tools, etc… (see pic below)

The Ruger has roughly around 30-50 loaded and fired through her. The pistol is in fantastic shape except for a few scratches at the loading gate from where the primer holder rubbed up against it (see pic). And then on the bottom in front of the trigger guard where my father had a hard time cleaning it after the first day out.
The 2 Thompson rifles “might” have a whopping total of 10 rounds through each of them.
All 3 are just about in perfect condition. And other than what is mentioned above about the Ruger, nothing else is wrong with any of the 3 piece’s. No surface rust or pit marks, and all the wood on them are in fantastic condition (I especially like the finish on the 36cal, kinda cool looking).
Almost all of the accessories are new…..even the powder has yet to be opened. A few even have the price tag still on ‘em.

THIS IS A GROUP PACKAGE – Asking for just one of them is the same as it would be for all.
I suspect if I had to put a price on this package, it would be around the 700 or 800 dollar mark, if not higher.
But this is really just a trade ad. So, to begin with, I am looking mostly for a Ruger 357 magnum revolver. But not of the Blackhawk varity. I would love the little LCR varity though. (but I ain’t holdin my breathe on that one). But you can email me a offer of anything else as I am really wide open on this and not too picky.

I’m not expecting anything from this, seeing as I know how everyone feels about black powder firearms. And I really don’t mind just keeping it and packaging all of this up, sealing it in a airtight crate, and shoving it up in the attic or in storage facility somewhere because all I am really doing here is making room in my safe so everything isn’t clanging around against each other. But I figured….eh…what the heck, I don’t shoot this stuff and ain’t gonna be shooting it anytime soon (if ever at all). It came from inheritance (other than the accessories I bought a while back). So what the heck, see if I can get something out of it I need.
Hence…..here we are…….
THESE ARE FOR LOCAL TRADING IN GEORGIA ONLY.
Thanks for looking and reading my rambleings.

It has BOTH a 125 lumen light AND a red laser. For use with most pistols with tactical rails. I even mounted it on my AR-15 and it worked brilliantly.

    The penetrating power of 125 peak Lumens
    Waterproof to 20m/66ft
    Ambidextrous rocker switch
    125 lumens of peak output
    Built-in shock suppression

    The M6X light operates on two 3V lithium batteries (included)
    Instant tool-free mounting and removal

It currently has a ~30"" full choke barrel but, like I said above, you can easily change that with an 1100 barrel to nearly whatever barrel type you would like.

It shoots wonderfully. I've only ever shot skeet with it but was extremely accurate with it and baffled a lot of people when they saw the performance of it even with a full choke. Very pleased with the gun but I just don't have any real use it for at this time.

348,http://www.armslist.com/posts/419348,For Sale:  Sig 522 Classic *PRICE DROP*,"Steubenville (43952), Ohio, United States",$ 325,"Listed On: Friday, June 1, 2012",Rifles,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Sig 522 for sale. Bought new, a little over a year old, good condition except for what is mostly a cosmetic issue. 

I was trying to do a modification to the storage tube inside of the 'gas block' (its not really a gas block and is purely aesthetic, its what would be the gas block on the sig 556) to mount a laser sight in there. Unfortunately, I sheered off a screw tap and haven't been able to get it out due to lacking the proper tools to do so. I also had to cut the storage tube off to allow the front end piece to be snapped back into place as a result. The end result of this whole thing is there is a screw tap snapped off inside of the cosmetic-only "" gas block "" and it no longer has a storage tube. When the front end-cap is in place, you can't tell that anything is wrong.

Function is flawless and I would never have attempted the above if there were any chance that it would effect function. With the proper tools it shouldn't be hard to get the tap out and finish the mod. A cheap laser sight to use for that purpose is included and is mounted on the front rail.

Also includes a foregrip and a total of 3 Sig 26 round magazines and a BSA red dot. Also it has the tri-rails mounted on the front of the grip, these too, are an option and don't come on the gun new. I'll throw in some 22lr ammo as well to get you going in the unlikely event you don't already have a 22lr gun.

This thing has fired every 22lr I have thrown at it. It runs excellently.

This is probably the best of the 'tacticool' 22s, in my opinion. 

Because of the cosmetic issue I'm going to let it go pretty cheap for a Sig 522. First $325 gets it. (They are $450+ New without said accessories.)

I have an M&P listed in the Handguns section too. Whichever goes first wins, I keep the other.

I am in Steubenville but don't mind a moderate drive to meet halfway. This is my one and only price drop on this gun."

A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage). Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs.

It's a very good example of how good a WASR can be. No canted sights or gas block. All major parts have matching serials. Front trunnion shows that the parts were manufactured in 1982. Has the triangle and arrow stamping (from a de-milled military rifle). Barrel is a Romanian new-manufacture and chrome-lined. Bore is in very very great condition. Total round count is exactly 600. I've had absolutely 0 malfunctions. Cleaned and lubed after each shooting session. It's been well taken care of. I've had this up for while before, but nothing has come up that interested me, so I held onto it for a while longer. Now I think it's time to fish around for some offers again.

Some ""custom"" things that I've done to the rifle:
-Degreased and coated it with black engine enamel. Its held up fine to solvents and oil, but shows wear in the usual places like the safety switch and dust cover.
-Epoxied a small shim on the inside of the magwell to eliminate mag wobble. There wasn't a lot of mag wobble before, and it ran perfectly fine before too. It just annoyed me.

Comes with:
-5 steel mags, 1 Tapco 20-rounder
-Romanian mag pouch that holds 4 mags, cleaning kit, and oiler
-Butt-stock cleaning kit, cleaning rod, and oiler
-Bayonet
-Sling
-Possibly a couple boxes of 7.62x39 if I have any laying around"

Its back up now it's an 1981 maxim it's got 36,xxx miles since it still being driven from time to time. I picked this up a while back to get back into riding, it didn't take long as now I've moved on to a bigger bike. This bike is a great starter-fixer upper- bobber chopper project. It starts and runs but needs to have carbs synced. They were rebuilt in September but not a perfect job. This thing will drive all over Tulsa, and get my big butt up to 75 on the highway no problem. I was going to do a bobber job on this until I realized it was a little to ambitious for me. Now I'm passing it on. the good is that it is the impossibly reliable 1980s Yamaha motor, starts, runs and drives fine, has a new back tire and battery on it and I just replaced the starter. the bad... the carbs as I stated need synced (some stutter and backfire until warmed up currently) was going to turn into a rat bobber so I went ahead and drained the front break. they are still attached they just need to be refilled and repressurized. and some other ""quarks"" you could expect from a 31 year old motor cycle spots of rust etc. I also made the side panels myself out of retired century 21 signs. they give it a very unique look (again was making it a low dollar bobber project, and the side panels weren't on it when I got it so I just fabricated some up) For the money what you get is a great starter bike good enough to run for big guys (I'm 5'10 and weigh 315ish pounds) to highway speeds, good gas mileage and a bike that will get you through the riding season no problem. or if you're looking for a project bike is great option for a drop and chop job. Let me know if you have any questions. spammers need not respond, and low ballers will be laughed at and ignored. I'm not hurting by any means to sell so can take my time to get the right offer"

34 round factory glock magazine for an additional $50. They are sold as 33 rounds, meaning a +2 baseplate. But if you notice the +2 is actually for the .40 caliber. You can actually load 34 rounds in the magazine outside the State of Ohio.

Additional magazine sold as a collectible only. Ohio law states that 30 rounds is the max for centerfire firearms.

Also interestingly enough uses a linkage attached to the hammer to run a striker that passes down the barrel to the loading port.

A neat example of old world craftsmanship.

The downside is the stock's been refinished, the rear sight stalk is broken off, and the loading port breech is missing. Salvageable for parts, restorable if you can find or make a new breech tab, or a neat wall-hanger."

The rifle was originally a Steyr 1912 Mexican contract Mauser '98 in 7x57, but those rifles were used by the Austro-Hungarians in WW1, after which it appears some German or Austrian gunsmith or tinkerer of moderate skill began to customize, but due to the Great Depression didn't have the money to do a classic bespoke customization job on.

It's got a bent-and-spooned bolt, of a not particularly elegant but serviceable job. It also has express sight leaves, a double set-trigger, and a recontoured and spliced military stock that bears the traditional Germanic styling.

Three Discrete Head
Professional Cassette Deck

Some light scratch’s but nothing that compromises its function or looks.
Adult owned and not abused

In 1973 Nakamichi created stereo cassette decks with such high quality that eventually made reel-to-reel tape recorders obsolete for consumers. The Nakamichi 1000 and 700 were regarded as two of the finest cassette recorders made in the mid-1970s. They had three heads, dual capstan drive that reduced wow and flutter to new low levels, and Dolby-B noise reduction to improve the signal to noise ratio. The feature that really set them apart was the adjustable record head azimuth and Dolby calibration that could be optimized for each cassette tape.
SPECIFICATIONS
•	Head(s): '3' 
•	Noise reduction: 'B' 
•	Tape monitor 
•	Meters: 'Needle' 
•	Tape: 'EX, SX'

I don't have to get rid of the gun just thought maybe I could trade it towards a gun I like better. Don't get me wrong I love this gun but I'm looking for a lighter polymer frame gun. I'm looking to trade it towards a full-size Glock 21 or 22 or also a full-size XD 40 or 45, preferably a XDM model. I also have cash to add towards the deal for the right trade. So let me know what you have.

Bought new, a little over a year old, good condition except for what is mostly a cosmetic issue. 

I was trying to do a modification to the storage tube inside of the 'gas block' (its not really a gas block and is purely aesthetic, its what would be the gas block on the sig 556) to mount a laser sight in there. Unfortunately, I sheered off a screw tap and haven't been able to get it out due to lacking the proper tools to do so. I also had to cut the storage tube off to allow the front end piece to be snapped back into place as a result. The end result of this whole thing is there is a screw tap snapped off inside of the cosmetic-only "" gas block "" and it no longer has a storage tube. When the front end-cap is in place, you can't tell that anything is wrong.

Function is flawless and I would never have attempted the above if there were any chance that it would effect function. With the proper tools it shouldn't be hard to get the tap out and finish the mod. A cheap laser sight to use for that purpose is included and is mounted on the front rail.

Also includes a foregrip and a total of 3 Sig 26 round magazines and a BSA red dot. Also it has the tri-rails mounted on the front of the grip, these too, are an option and don't come on the gun new. I'll throw in some 22lr ammo as well to get you going in the unlikely event you don't already have a 22lr gun.

This thing has fired every 22lr I have thrown at it. It runs excellently.

This is probably the best of the 'tacticool' 22s, in my opinion. 

Because of the cosmetic issue I'm going to let it go pretty cheap for a Sig 522. First $300 gets it. (They are $450+ New without said accessories.)

This is an absolute rock bottom price.

Must be willing to meet within a 1hr drive of Steubenville (43952).

Must sell by tomorrow morning."
