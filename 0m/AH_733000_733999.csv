I'm a private collector and, as part of a multi-gun lot in a recent auction, picked up an excellent .38 Special revolver.  It doesn’t fit in with the rest of my collection, so I’m offering it for sale, but not before testing it thoroughly at my local range. It is in great shape; is spot-on accurate; and will be an excellent, low-cost self-defense or carry gun for a new owner.  The revolver is a Llama Ruby Extra, made in the 1960s in Spain by the Llama-Gabilondo y Cia company to compete globally with Smith & Wesson’s Model 10 as a police issue sidearm.  This Llama has features like a grooved backstrap for a better grip and a grooved top strap to cut down on haze in the sight radius that make is actually nicer than the Smith & Wesson Model 10.  The Llama Ruby Extra sold well to police departments in South America and the Philippines but this one must have been shipped directly to the US as it is not import-marked.  The bore/lands/grooves are in great condition and the gun has just a trace of finish wear at the muzzle, so it seems to have spent more time in a sock drawer than a holster.  I'd prefer a face to face sale in the Glenview area.  You'll need a) to have a valid FOID card and drivers license with matching addresses, b) to sign a bill of sale c) to have the patience for a 72 hour waiting period [no exceptions], and have $245 cash or check.

This firearm offers a 21.5"" barrel for optimum velocity, but in a package around only 30"" long overall. This seems to be a later-manufacture rifle as it has both the extended magwell that was added in later years during the ban, but it has full-length muzzle threads and a flash hider rather than simply a short muzzle nut.

Rifle is used and has some noticeable wear on the right side of the upper receiver above the trigger, elsewhere the gun only has your standard occasional handling mark. The original owner also decided to put a pistol laser sight on the gun via drilling and tapping two small holes in the front receiver endcap, along with filing down a small area for clearance. The laser is long gone so these changes are visible, but they are not strikingly obvious and do not affect the function or mechanical integrity of the firearm.

USGI, PMAG, and Troy Battlemags have been tested with this rifle and all drop free. Included is one aluminum magazine (as pictured) which has been retrofitted with an anti-tilt follower."

The shooting at Sandy Hook has ignited a fierce discussion about guns and school safety. ABC Channel 6 will hold a town hall to bring together advocates on both sides of the issue.


The town hall will be on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 7:00 - 8:00 p.m. at the Ohio State University Union. And you can attend in person or watch the event online. We've been told this town hall may be picked up by as many as 100 stations around the country. 


Buckeye Firearms Association Legal Chair Ken Hanson and Attorney Derek DeBrosse will represent the pro-gun side of the issue. Toby Hoover, Executive Director of the Ohio Coalition Against Gun Violence, and a representative from the liberal activist group Progress Ohio will represent the anti-gun side of the issue. 


Despite what you've seen coming from the mainstream media in the last few days, most Americans are fed up with the passive, do-nothing approach to violence in our schools, churches, and public places. It's time we made our voices heard and say we're not going to stand for this anymore. It's time for solutions that actually stop cowardly mass murderers. 


resident Obama and other liberals see this horrible tragedy as nothing more than a political opportunity to push their laundry list of anti-gun nonsense, including weapon and magazine bans that have been proven an utter failure.

Please consider attending the town hall at the OSU Union. It will be seen nationwide and it's important to show Americans what we think.

This one is definitely not one of the ""cookie-cutter"" AR's you will find at any of the big name stores around that are selling for $1000 and up. And chances are you will be on a list to get one if you can find one of those anymore.

When I started this project I did a lot of research and ordered every part from quality manufacturers.
It's a high quality precision rifle on an AR platform. I would put it up against any other AR out there. I have shot Sub-MOA groups consistently out to 300 yards.
Here is the break down:
-Spikes Tactical receiver
-Rock River Arms 2-stage trigger and lower parts kit
-Rock River Arms buffer and spring
-Rock River Arms rubber molded grip
-BCM Mod 4 charging handle
-16"" 1:8 twist Nordic Match Grade Stainless Heavy Barrel w/ mid-length gas port (Properly broken in with one shot and clean method)
-Adams Arms mid-length adjustable gas/piston system (Perfect set-up for running suppressed)
-Midwest Industries Free floated 2 piece hand guard w/ rail covers
-Midwest Industries Flash suppressor/muzzle break
-Mako GL-shock adjustable butt stock
-Magpul Back Up Sights included
-Also includes tactical rifle bag
-(3) 20- round mags (will also likely be banned soon)

And if you're thinking its a high price then do some research and compare what is selling out there.  Standard barrels, plastic handles and plastic guards with cheap triggers are great for throwing in the sand and slinging bullets down range. Stamp a horse on it or paint it with zombies and skulls and they still shoot the same as any average AR.
You always get what you pay for in firearms.

It shows no wear from carry or use but doesn’t fit in with the rest of my collection, so I’m offering it for sale.  This gun was made in the 1950’s by the state armory in the Peoples Republic of China for the Red Army.  It is a faithful copy of the Tokarev pistol designed by China’s then-ally, the USSR, with exception of an added safety to allow cocked-and-locked carry (never carry an original design Russian Tokarev with a round in the chamber).  This gun is lightweight and well-balanced.  I’ve not fired this gun, but the ammunition choices are said to be varied and even quite fun!  Conventional 7.62 x 25 ammo is available from most of the major internet ammo sellers.  But you can also get green or red tracer ammo for low-light shooting.  Although the Type 54 is dated by contemporary military standards, this is said to be the most popular handgun among organized crime figures in Asia as the ammo available overseas is hot enough to defeat body armor.  I'd prefer a face to face sale in the Glenview area.  You'll need a) to have a valid FOID card and drivers license with matching addresses, b) to sign a bill of sale c) to have the patience for a 72 hour waiting period [no exceptions], and have $245 cash or check.

Buyer must be a WI resident with valid ID that can legally possess a firearm.  CCW a plus. Bill of sale will be written.  No trades or travel to make a sale.  Can ship to your FFL from my FFL for shipping+dealer fees.

Call me (NO TEXTS) if interested.  I don't get to email often but if you send one include your number if you want a reply.

Thanks for looking.

Im selling my LWRC M6A2 that I bought less than a month ago brand new. This is a gas piston AR-15 and one of the best on the market. It out competes ACR/SCARs and other piston driven ARs.
These guns have been out of stock for a long while so I had to go through a family member and past worker of LWRC to get ahold of one and waited a long while to get it. 
About 100 brass cased rounds fired through it. 
Comes with everything a new one would. - $4,500
No accessories included. This is just the gun and original packaging. I just increased the price by $800. Sorry, but I had received numerous offers for $3,700 so that price was just too low considering this is the best AR-15 on the market and they are about to get banned and they're out of stock everywhere else. Mine is basically brand new as well.

Price is non-negotiable! Dont waste my time or yours on any other offer. 

PMAGS - $25 each (for the window ones and regular ones)
GI Mags - $20 each
FSC 556 Compensator (Best on the market) - $150 
- Orignal flash hider is included in the rifles price along with everything else a new one comes with

asking 300.00 or  will trade for 308 ammo plus cash

made in 1968 it is in great shape. i took it to the range and it is very accurate.

it is numbers matching and the wood is dark mahogany, i thought about refinishing

the wood, but i just could not remove the patina and its history off of it.

i also have a 1907 pattern bayonet that i would sell with it. the bayonet fits the rifle
but is an earlier enfield bayonet i would take 80.00 for it

both rifle and bayonet would be 380.00

584,http://www.armslist.com/posts/733584,For Sale:  Top quality AK47,"Hamilton, Missoula, Montana","$ 2,000","Listed On: Tuesday, December 25, 2012",Rifles,no type,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a rare Bulgarian Arsenal SLR95 AK that was imported before the '99 import ban which required 922(r) compliance (a minimum proportion of US made parts).  It was imported with a plastic sporter thumbhole stock and a dust cover witha  picatinny rail on it (see top picture).  Lower pics are the current configuration.  

This of course is a milled receiver AK so it is much more durable, reliable, more accurate and instead of only lasting 6 lifetimes like the stamped AKs go, this baby will go 10 lifetimes!  It's also no heavier than a stamped receiver AK despite rumors.

I've re-militarized it by putting US made K-var warsaw pact length buttstock and pistol grip.  I've also added a tapco g2 double hook trigger group bringing it into compliance with 922(r).  The original Bulgarian trigger group is excellent and is included along with the original stock in case you want to go back to the collector quality 100% Bulgarian build (as shown in the first picture).  I've also put a Krebs Custom safety lever that has the bolt hold open notch and the lever on it so you can use your finger and keep your hand on the grip.

This gun, like current edition Bulgarian Arsenal SLRs (101) are probably the best Aks out there, better than the Russian ones.  Unlike the current SLRs, this one was shipped from the factory in Bulgaria fully assembled by the experts using all matching parts and perfect assembly...unlike current ones reassembled here by various US importers.  Current SLRs are $1k (http://www.k-var.com/shop/SLR-101S.html).  The value of this gun is at least between 1200-1500 BEFORE the panic.  I don't think $2000 is too much to ask, but I am negotiable.  

Gun comes with 7 clean, new Bulgarian mags (the good kind with the rib on the back) that could easily go for $50 a piece in todays market.  Also with the gun and mags is 300 rounds of ammo.

Round count: a flawless 400 or less.

Trades:

When you fire this gun it's immediately obvious you're not behind a normal AR-15 in 5.56. It's got a kick to let you know there's a 50 cal bullet headed downrange. It is manageable though and is similar to shooting an auto 20g shotgun or maybe even lighter than that. This one was test fired by the builder and is an absolute blast to shoot. It runs like a typewriter and is incredibly reliable. 

These uppers have been sent to our troops in the middle east to use at Check-Points. If a vehicle refuses to stop they fire one of these giant bullets from their modified AR to instantly seize the motor and stop the vehicle."

I traded for the upper and I was told that the upper receiver, barrel, and Bolt/Carrier Group are all from Wilson Combat.  The Bolt/Carrier Group are hard chromed and Nickel Boron coated, not sure but it is plated for lubricity and can be run much drier than a Mil-Spec equivalent.  The front and rear sights are both fold down Wilson Combat, the front sight is a tritium night sight.  The hand guard is a Daniel Defense free floating quad rail.  The barrel is 16"" ""black stainless"" 1:8 twist.  Mid-length gas system.  VERY nice upper.

The Bear Whitetail Hunter Bear bow is a classic compound bow that is designed with a weight adjustment range of 10 lbs and a draw length that can vary from 28 to 30 and even 32. This hunter bow is constructed with a thermal-bound resin that is epoxy-based for both flexibility and strength. The Bear bow is designed with a six-wheel construction that provides hunters with a strong grip and an even more powerful shot. The Bear Whitetail Hunter is a reliable bow that is designed for use by both beginning hunters as well as those who are more dedicated to the sport. The hunter bow is diverse enough to be used by most ages and body types, particularly due to its construction and six-wheel design. The Bear Whitetail Hunter is an adequate bow choice for hunters both old and young alike.
