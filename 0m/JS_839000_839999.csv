It could even be cut in half, (back and front) and sewn to a pair of camo pants and shirt or flight suit or even a pair of unlined coveralls and you would have two sets.

On Thursday, Darrell Scott, the father of Rachel Scott, a victim of the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, Colorado, was invited to address the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee. What he said to our national leaders during this special session of Congress was painfully truthful.
They were not prepared for what he was to say, nor was it received well. It needs to be heard by every parent, every teacher, every politician, every sociologist, every psychologist, and every so-called expert! These courageous words spoken by Darrell Scott are powerful, penetrating, and deeply personal. There is no doubt that God sent this man as a voice crying in the wilderness. The following is a portion of the transcript:

""Since the dawn of creation there has been both good &evil in the hearts of men and women. We all contain the seeds of kindness or the seeds of violence. The death of my wonderful daughter, Rachel Joy Scott, and the deaths of that heroic teacher, and the other eleven children who died must not be in vain. Their blood cries out for answers.
""The first recorded act of violence was when Cain slew his brother Abel out in the field. The villain was not the club he used.. Neither was it the NCA, the National Club Association. The true killer was Cain, and the reason for the murder could only be found in Cain's heart.
""In the days that followed the Columbine tragedy, I was amazed at how quickly fingers began to be pointed at groups such as the NRA. I am not a member of the NRA. I am not a hunter. I do not even own a gun. I am not here to represent or defend the NRA - because I don't believe that they are responsible for my daughter's death. Therefore I do not believe that they need to be defended. If I believed they had anything to do with Rachel's murder I would be their strongest opponent
I am here today to declare that Columbine was not just a tragedy -- it was a spiritual event that should be forcing us to look at where the real blame lies! Much of the blame lies here in this room. Much of the blame lies behind the pointing fingers of the accusers themselves. I wrote a poem just four nights ago that expresses my feelings best. 

Your laws ignore our deepest needs,
Your words are empty air.
You've stripped away our heritage,
You've outlawed simple prayer.
Now gunshots fill our classrooms,
And precious children die.
You seek for answers everywhere,
And ask the question ""Why?""
You regulate restrictive laws,
Through legislative creed.
And yet you fail to understand,
That God is what we need!

""Men and women are three-part beings. We all consist of body, mind, and spirit. When we refuse to acknowledge a third part of our make-up, we create a void that allows evil, prejudice, and hatred to rush in and wreak havoc. Spiritual presences were present within our educational systems for most of our nation's history. Many of our major colleges began as theological seminaries. This is a historical fact. 
What has happened to us as a nation? We have refused to honor God, and in so doing, we open the doors to hatred and violence. And when something as terrible as Columbine's tragedy occurs -- politicians immediately look for a scapegoat such as the NRA. They immediately seek to pass more restrictive laws that contribute to erode away our personal and private liberties. We do not need more restrictive laws. 
Eric and Dylan would not have been stopped by metal detectors. No amount of gun laws can stop someone who spends months planning this type of massacre. The real villain lies within our own hearts. 

""As my son Craig lay under that table in the school library and saw his two friends murdered before his very eyes, he did not hesitate to pray in school. I defy any law or politician to deny him that right! I challenge every young person in America , and around the world, to realize that on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School prayer was brought back to our schools. Do not let the many prayers offered by those students be in vain. Dare to move into the new millennium with a sacred disregard for legislation that violates your God-given right to communicate with Him. 

To those of you who would point your finger at the NRA -- I give to you a sincere challenge.. Dare to examine your own heart before casting the first stone! 
My daughter's death will not be in vain! The young people of this country will not allow that to happen!""

And I'm only looking to trade one for a LWRC M6 SPR. Doubt anyone on here actually owns a High end rifle or know's what one is. Since all I'm seeing is low end rifles going for over $2k. If you would like to know, this rifle is pulling $3500-$5,000 right. 

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths and in either 5.56mm NATO or 6.8mm SPC. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

These Rifles were produced by Yugoslavia at the Kragujevac arsenal, and were named the ""Model 1948 98k Short Rifle"" or the Yugoslavian M48. They were based in on the German 98k Mauser.
The M48 is a little shorter in overall length in the barrel and the overall length of the rifle than the German 98k

Manufactured by Yugoslavia into the 60's they became obsolete with the proliferation of the Automatic rifle. So they were lovingly stored for civil militia/reserve use, and test fired every 5 years. 50 years later they have been released on the collectors market.
Yugoslavia produced many of these rifles, and many are still available on the market in mint condition These 8mm rifles are extraordinary shooters that are well made and offer a unique opportunity to the shooter and collector to purchase a Like New version of the very dependable and well made Mauser 98k."

""Leupold CDS™ models allow you to quickly dial your elevation to different sight-in ranges with a custom adjustment matched to your specific ballistics information. The CDS dials change out easily, allowing you flexibility with different loads, conditions and calibers. Every CDS dial features ¼-MOA click increment finger adjustments and no adjustment covers to lose, making the VX-2, VX-3, VX-6 and VX-R even more accurate and rugged. How the CDS™ System Works The CDS System works by laser-inscribing your scope's elevation dial to match your load, velocity and conditions. Your scope will be in perfect synch with the way your rifle and load shoots, even for hand loads. Each CDS dial is unique, taking all practical ballistic and environmental factors into account."""

If the ban goes into effect, then semi-auto shotguns with pistol grips like this one will be banned. Take advantage of this now before I change my mind and keep it! 

The 930 SPX Blackwater Edition:

Tactical 12 Gauge Shotgun With 18.5″ Barrel, XS Ghost Ring Rear Sight, AR-15 Style Front Sight, 8 Shot Extended Capacity & Full Length Pistol Grip Black Synthetic Stock. Fixed Cylinder Bore Choke. “Blackwater” Logo On Left Side Of The Receiver. Chamber both 2 3/4 inch and 3-inch 12-gauge shotshells with ease—from target loads, to non-toxic magnum loads, to the latest sabot slug ammo.

Basically these were made for Blackwater Security. Same as the 590A1 and the Sig Sauer P226 9MM Handgun. They are no longer in production and hard to come by. Only way to own one now is IF the owners of them now were willing to sell them. 

You can still purchase the standard 930 SPX for around $865-$1000. But the Blackwater Tactical Edition is hard to come by, it's basically wanted because of the name. So it tends to draw more attention and highly sought after.

Honestly I have all the firearms I need. The standard model 930 SPX are going for $1000 on Gunbroker now. The MSRP on them new were $865. 

I however will keep your offers in mind, but I will be keeping an eye on gunbroker. It might end up on there. As there are very few Blackwater editions.

NEF New England Firearms Pardner Pump 12ga Home Defense Shotgun.  12 gauge, 3"" chamber (will shoot 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells).  6 round capacity (5 in the magazine plus 1 in the chamber, one round higher than the 870).  Model number is NP1-P18

This is a Remington 870 clone, manufactured for NEF (who is now owned by Remington coincidentally).  In my opinion, the quality of this gun is superior to that of the current generation Remington 870 Express guns, of which it is a copy.

Gun does show some minor wear from racking and storage, but it is the kind of thing that you'd expect to see after a week or two of use.  I was told the gun is unfired when I bought it, and believe that to be the case (I have not fired it since I purchased it).  My best guess is that it was purchased, unboxed, and loaded and stuck in a corner until I bought it.

These retail for about $200 + tax new, and are currently sold out at every supplier I checked with.  Next cheapest option for a similarly equipped gun would be $250-$300 plus tax.

This is an ideal home defense gun, esp for someone on a budget.  It's even factory drilled and tapped to accept a scope or red-dot sight, so you could even use it for hunting if you were so inclined.

Price is firm.

NOTE: This gun is on hold for a local buyer until 1/18.  If you are interested, please send me a message and I'll compile a wait list in case the current interested party falls through."

Has carrying handle plus added an after-market scope mount.  No scope is included with this sale but the mount is there.  Also has sling hooks.

This L1A1 has been sitting around for years in the closet.  It has a slight amount of surface corrosion but nothing that affects performance.  Was only fired maybe 100 or 150 times since purchased.

Buyer will need to provide a drivers license copy plus we'll need to do a bill of sale.  Absolutely no felons or similar issues.  If you are not aware of the rules for this type of sale then please do the research.

Cash Sale but will consider a Ruger Mark II / III or similar .22 LR semi auto with threaded barrel as a partial trade."

Due to confusion, I am reposting my ad.  The Pistol in the picture is NOT included but everything else is.  This is FN PS90 with very low round count.  The factory scope is updated with TEM T3 updated...it back lights blue so it can be used in the dark.  Optional side mount picatinny rails were also added so you can install different accessories.  One of the biggest complaints is the charge handle on the PS90 being too small....this has been updated on both sides to a larger, more comfortable knob for a true ambidextrous operation.  There is also a single point sling mount that is detachable for carrying.  On top of everything, 900 rounds of original FN 5.7X28mm is included.  That alone is worth a fortune.  

Anyways, all boxes, locks manuals and etc are all included.  Asking $3600 for the whole lot.  This is a true bullpup that has 50 rds capacity.  There is also 4 clips included.

Please let me know.  Thanks

The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

Very light use, looks almost new. 

Includes all original FA parts except for the disconnector. All NFA rules apply. Comes with $41 worth of new AK Builder parts including a proper Romanian 80% receiver flat, rivet kit and center spacer/rivet. 

Note: Be careful with kits which have new barrels unless they are properly head spaced already. Unless you know what you’re doing and know how to use a mill you will end up ruining your barrel, trunion or both. There is only a 0.003 difference between a good build and a pile of junk. Alternatively, sending a barrel out to a smith will cost you $100 or more. 

If the bans some of our government representatives want to get passed happen these spare parts kits will become “priceless”. If your state and local laws prohibit these parts do not bid on this auction, I will not ship to locations which prohibit such parts. Ground shipping is a flat $18 to the lower 48. Contact me for qoutes on other shipping methods. Local pickup possible too.

I am selling 5 of these kits so let me know how many you want."

I bought this configuration over the 5.56 / 223 because of the availability of ammo both for plinking and ammo with good bullets for hunting.  The FMJ's are fine for punching holes in paper and there are lots of good choices for true hunting ammo.  This can be a combination fun/deer hunting setup.

I have a Ruger LCR I'm looking to trade for a semi auto pistol. My LCR is in great shape. I am the 2nd owner, and i am yet to fire it. First owner advised it had less than 50 rounds down the pipe.

I really want to trade for a semi auto pistol. I also have a Western Arms (i believe) .22 derringer that i would consider worth about $80 as well. Thanks for your time and shoot me any offers.
