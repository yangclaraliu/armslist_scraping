I tried several muzzle breaks to ensure it is best tuned to gun and the troy break creates no muzzle rise on this build. Soft straight back recoil. I put this ar together and have done more than 30 rifle builds/setups and have all proper tools, skills, and am very meticulous.

Let me know what you have anyway.  I prefer to trade for this handgun, but I can pay cash if I really have to. I am trying to save my $$$ for the hunting trip. I have a 10mm I can use for pigs, but I would really like a 44. See below for trade items:

1. Remington Model 710 .270 WIN bolt action rifle with a Bushnell 3-9 on it.

2. AR Parts- Magazines, stocks, etc.

3. Body Armor- Plates and Soft Armor.

4. .308 Ammo Federal GMM Sierra Boat Tail HP 168 GRN

5.  .40 S and W Ammo: Winchester 180GRN FMJ and Winchester LE Ranger 180 GRN.

I am not looking to pay retail prices. The Blackhawk is a 350-450 dollar gun depending on condition and use. I do NOT want any scope or scope mounting equipment with it. I will not pay you or trade you 1000 rounds of 2 dollar a round .308 ammo for a 400 dollar gun. Let's be fair here and make a deal. I have grown tired of Armslist idiots in the past wanting $300 for a Tasco scope.

I need this item ASAP as I am going on hunting trip down south. Night hunting with a rifle isnt allowed, so I need a large caliber handgun to use.

Contact Kevin at 585 322 4237 for immediate response. You can call or text. I prefer local buyer like Finger Lakes, Rochester, etc, but if the deal is right I could travel."

This is an excellent shooter, DA/SA, 12+1 capacity, fires the 9x18 Makarov round.

I am wanting to trade the gun with a bunch of extras.


Whole package includes

-(3) 12 rounds magazines with milled floorplates

-Black leather military surplus holster

-Desantis 106-v5 IWB leather gun holster, for ruger lc9 (also fits CZ-82 as shown nicely, the lip is a bit chewed up, dog got to it, but isn't uncomfortable or noticable when wearing and wears nicely.)

-(1) 50 round box of Prvi Partisan brass cased, reloadable 93 gr FMJ's

- 28 rounds of steel cased russian 9m mak ammo, 92 gr FMJ

-250 rounds of hardcast, brass cased, RN ammo, I was told these are 115 gr and are loaded to the same specs as Buffalo Bore +P rounds, which is 115 gr at 1000 fps, I have fired them and they have noticably more kick to them than regular FMJ's, so I'd attest that they are more powerful.

-6 Glaser safety slugs

-13 rounds of Hornday XTP hollopoints

The CZ-82 has an upgraded 16lb wolff recoil spring, over the factory 14 pound, helps reduce the already tame recoil.

Comes with upgraded recoil spring, the original recoil spring, and a new firing pin spring as well.

I have fired maybe 300 rounds since I got this gun, and the polygynal rifling, coupled with the fixed barrel makes this gun very accurate, I was easily able to put 12 rounds into a 3 1/2 inch group at 15 yards the first time I shot it.

Some wear on the slide, the finish has chipped off, this is very common with these guns as the finish wasn't very good, but gun functions flawlessly, have never had a FTF or FTE.


CZ-82 price = 200 + 38$ shipping + 10$ hand pick fee + 25$ FFL transfer = 278$
2 extra mags @ 22$ each + 9 $ shipping = 53$
x2 boxes of FMJ brown bear = 26$
1 box of prvi partisan = 15$
Desantis holster = 10$
13 Hornday XTP hollowpoints = 6$
Recoil spring = 12$
glaser slugs, 3$
250 hardcast = 100$
28 rounds russian ammo = 5$



Total cost for everything comes out to 508$

I'm really leaning towards a new handgun in .45 ACP, so if you have one and would like to trade it, you'll get first priority.

If you are willing to wait, I will also have a Military/Police surplus Leather shoulder holster rig for the CZ-82 coming in soon as well for a RH shooter. which I will add to the trade, for 20$ extra (which is an excellent deal as you won't find a surplus shoulder holster specifically made for the CZ-82 anywhere)


I'd be willing to trade my CZ-82 and everything picture for 450$ towards your trade, or can be bought outright for 500$"

The Flash II has got to be one of the coolest knives we've ever seen. Forget its wicked-quick blade access, that it handles like a race car on rails, or that it locks up like Alcatraz. It just looks and feels extraordinary. The Flash family of knives feature SOG Assisted Technology™ (S.A.T.), which employs a powerful piston lock that is easily released with a sliding button.

The Flash II (Partially Serrated) comes standard with glass-reinforced nylon (GRN) handle and 1/2 serrated blade. All Flash knives come standard with SOG's patent pending, reversible bayonet mounted clip that ensures the lowest, most discreet carry possible. We also had the foresight to incorporate an additional safety lock that gives added security when the blade is closed. Blade is made of AUS-8 material !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Extras with the 92 is Hogue wraparound grips, of course original also and 6 mags. Two mags are factory, 3  are ""LE and military only"", one is a pro mag. They're all 15 rounders with only 1 problem with the pro mag, it won't feed the last round, more than likely a quality spring will fix that issue.

Details on Beretta: The 92 has wear, but nothing serious. Dot and post ""M9"" sights. DA trigger pull is heavy but smooth. SA is light especially after acclimating to that sweet spot. I take great pride in my weapons and do field strip maintenance at least once a week regardless if I shoot or not, complete disassemble and detailed cleaning about every 500 rounds. I've put roughly around 1K rounds through it with zero issues, probably alot due to the fact I'm not an ""I've shot x many rounds without cleaning it"" guy. It's an older model (1990) so there is no plastic parts. I won't throw in the IWB holster because it should fit the Armalite as well, but if what you got for the ""AR"" works for you might for me and vice versa.

 I'm not trading it for any other reason besides the fact that I've been wanting an AR 24-15 since I've seen it and recent financial issues prevent me from buying one. DO NOT CONTACT ME WITH LOWBALL OFFERS. I'm not trying to rip anyone off or get a steal or turn a profit, so I expect the same in return. 

I have well over 500 in mine and I paid a very fair price used. I have pics and will text or email them upon request. I'll return emails fairly quickly and if it's reasonable we can work from the phone through there. Sorry for so much info, hoping to get serious contacts only. Thanks for reading."

PARKER'S SAFES AND VAULTS is a family-run, home-based business operating under Godly principles. We carry CHAMPION and SUPERIOR brand safes. They are sister companies owned by Ray Crosby. (www.championgunsafes.com and www.superiorgunsafes.com) I could carry a bunch of other brands, and have been approached by some other companies, but I choose Champion and Superior because of their quality, customer service, U.S.A. manufacturing and warranty. I wouldn't sell you a brand that I don't have faith in or wouldn't own myself. (I own a Superior.)
I also keep my prices very fair. I don't run a lot of sale price specials. You won't have to wonder if you could have saved a few dollars by waiting for a big sale. The prices are already low. I'm not trying to retire after one big sale- I just want to sell a lot of safes! When you buy a safe from me and then, because you were happy, tell your friend and he buys a safe, you've stumbled onto my business model.

PARKER'S SAFES AND VAULTS carries around 30 gun safes in sizes from 17 cubic feet up to 95 cubic feet and WE DELIVER, INSTALL AND SERVICE! That means we'll bring the safe to you, put it where you want it, get it level, bolt it down,(if you want), explain how to operate and maintain your new safe and lock, explain the warranty paperwork AND help you if you have an issue in the future. (I've only seen 2 problems in 4 years and they were both minor).

If you'd like to see and talk about some quality safes in person, give me a call and arrange a visit. If you just have some questions about safes, call, email or text me.


HERE ARE SOME TESTIMONIALS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS...

""Aaron Parker is an honest and personable individual who beat prices around the state. After you have done your homework and shopped around, go see Aaron. He beat Cabela's prices for a comparable safe by $1500."" - Brandt M.

""Mr. Parker gave me a fair deal and outstanding on-time delivery and installation. Also, his two young sons, who assisted him, are just about the most polite, well-behaved boys I have ever met."" -Ramona H.

""We bought our safe from Aaron last year and were very impressed by his knowledge and service. He told us about each style of safe and how each would or wouldn't be suited to our needs. Delivery was flawless. His product quality is excellent."" -Mike and Kathy C.

""I have had my safe for over a year and love it. When I bought it from Parker's, I was very happy with the price and the looks of the safe. It looks great. The safe was delivered and set up when he said it would be. I was shown how to work it and told if there was any problems to call. I have never called because I have never had a problem. Prior to getting it from Parker's, I looked all over. The quality of my safe is so much better than the ones I had looked at. One of the other stores I looked at had a floor model that would not open. Most of them were so light I could move them by myself. I wanted something safe and that's what I got from Parker's."" -Earl P.

""Doing business with Aaron was the best service and sales all my life. Excellent all around. He never pushed sales on us. We wanted to buy his safe. Delivery was perfect. (and it was your hardest install!)"" -Leslie and Jinx

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to helping you find the right safe.
