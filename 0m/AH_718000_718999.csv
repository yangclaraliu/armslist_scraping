The GLOCK 27 G4 is the Mighty Mini in .40 cal. It is amazingly accurate and controllable; the G27 puts 10 rounds of .40 cal. at your fingertips in a packable small enough for a pocket or ankle holster. This is the ideal backup gun to complement the larger GLOCK .40s. The 4th Generation of the Glock Safe Action Pistol brings revolutionary design changes to the world's most popular pistol. Externally, what is immediately apparent is the multiple back strap design of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to small, standard and large frame hands. The surface if the frame is the Gen4 Rough Textured frame scientifically designed, real world tested, internally, the Gen4 GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed operators."

 * Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
 * The bolt of the VZ 2008 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
 * The VZ 2008 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
 * The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ 58.
 * The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ 2008.
 * The VZ 2008 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. 
* The alloy magazine of the VZ 2008 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lb. vs. .84 lb.)
 * VZ 2008 is easier to field strip.
 * The VZ 2008 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47.

    I am selling because I thought I would like Trap and Skeet shooting and Competitions, so I had this beautiful gun. But I really just love waterfowl and upland game hunting. This gun was great for upland so accurate and smooth, but here as many places waterfowl hunting is nasty and this gun is too nice IMHO to have out there. i took it twice and spent more time wiping it down then hunting. lol. So I will just use my waterfowl shotgun and get another one and if I have the hankering shoot skeet with those.

The ’s patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder than hard chrome. 

The 5.45x39 caliber bullet matches high muzzle velocity with excellent sectional density, resulting in a flat trajectory and good penetration. The standard ball cartridge will penetrate 5mm of steel plate at a distance of 350 meters. The lowered recoil impulse of the 5.45mm cartridge (verses the 7.62x39mm) has a beneficial effect on accuracy. The 5.45x39mm cartridge is an excellent round that offers comparable penetration, accuracy and lethality to anything fielded by NATO. More importantly, 5.45x39 ammunition is less expensive to shoot! This rifle has been designed to handle dirty and corrosive surplus ammunition. The bolt and bolt carrier have been protected by an ion-bond finish. These processes make the parts corrosive resistant. Now you have the ability to shoot the inexpensive corrosive mil-surplus ammo without the fear of the parts being unduly worn. 

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical tooling dimensions held within ±.001"" and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control."

Yes, your lower is collectible and therefore more valuable than your average. More valuable as in $400 or so.   I bought a COMPLETE LE6920 for $950 three months ago (and yes, it has the ""restricted"" rollmark, just like yours).

This rifle will only be for sale for today only or tomorrow morning in the Wichita area.
It is a 6.8SPC AR15 built by Stag Arms. This isnt pieced together.
What I have in the rifle from purchase to now after all taxes and paperwork:
6.8 rifle itself: $1250
Knights Armament quad rail system $299
2 extra magazines: $50
Silver State Armory, 4 boxes: $100
I have roughly $1700 in this. I will put original hand guards back on for $1300 and keep the quad rails.
I also have a bipod grip, a tactical nylon case with pockets for mags, etc on the outside, and a surefire flashlight with the M93 quick release mount and the KM3 dual light. It switches from bright white to IR infrared for use on night vision. Ive been using these on my AR10 (which is not for sale). I will include all of these as well if you would like.

Price for what you see in the first picture + 2 extra mags and 4 boxes of ammo: $1500
Price for that but without the quad rails and original handguards back on: $1300
Price for everything in the second picture: $2000
The surefire light alone is sells for over $500 new with the KM3 light and M93 attachment. Look up KM3 or M93 on amazon and those two alone are roughly $250 each.

After tomorrow morning this will be taken back offline and I will just keep it. Thanks"

I am Looking for either a Walther PPK, makarov .380, MAYBE a Walther PPS. That is about all I am looking for. If you have an offer be prepared to meet ATLEAST half way. I am not playing the whole game of heres an offer now come drive 4 hours to me. It wont happen. I am not looking for cash either. I am only looking to trade. I do not have to get rid of this pistol. It is a very very nice CCW gun. But seeing as I have a 26 and 19, I am looking to get a new small carry gun! Thanks!

I would prefer a PPK in decent condition. As well as .380, BUT I will consider .32acp. Any holsters are a plus! Saves me from having to find one for it! Any ammo is a plus as well! You can reach me at REDACTED Text anytime! Call Sun-Wed 8-8 Thu-Sat 6-6.

Accuracy is amazing. Includes dies, bullets and brass. .308 Norma Magnum, will do everything a .300 Win Mag will do with less powder. Simmons Scope 6.5 - 20 x 50 AO mildot. Rifle w/scope weighs approximately 16 pounds, will ship to your FFL. If you aren't a reloader but would like to start I can include a Lee Loader in this caliber instead of the dies.
Receiver and muzzle tapped for iron sights if you wish. Twist rate looks like 1:11 which is is correct for the caliber (according to E.R. Shaw anyways)
Can send more photographs.
Bench, Target, Sniper."

Even if it hasn't been fired but once. It IS A USED GUN!!! I see some in these listings where sellers are asking more than what they cost in a retail gun store. So just check retail price before you make any deal. Get the price and what they are selling from their listing. Call a gun store before you buy and you will find that most aren't giving you a deal at all for used guns. And some are even more than the actually cost."
