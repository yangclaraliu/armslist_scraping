This was originally purchased for my wife to carry but she does not like the recoil so it just got shot some at the range and carried every once in a while.  I noticed last time at the range that the cylinder would sometimes not properly turn unless you moved it a little.  It didn't happen often but enough to be concerned about.  I began looking at the gun and noticed that there was some wear to the extractor star.  It appears that there are some small grooves that have worn some that are causing the problem so I broke the gun down.  Since I broke the gun down, my plan was to replace the extractor and clean the internals real good.  That is where the problems began.  I realized that I have no clue how to remove the extractor nor do I have the tools.  I checked online and the parts are cheap but I have no clue how to do it.  Then on top of that I have no clue how to properly lube/grease the action to get that smooth feel back.  It has a lifetime warranty but Taurus takes months to perform warranty work and a gunsmith would charge way too much so I have decided to cut my losses since we don't use the gun and just sell it to someone that can.  I am asking $125.00 for the gun as is.  I can reassemble the gun if someone needs me to, so they can see what the exact problems are.  Just know this is a project gun.  It won't cost much to fix and I am sure you will come out ahead but only if you are good with gun work.  The gun comes with a set of Wolff springs, Hogue grips, the original grips, and original box/paperwork.  Serious inquiries only at REDACTED"

It is a Model 54 (fore-runner of the Model 70) bolt action high powered rifle.  It was built in 1928 and originally had a checkered walnut stock.  This particular rifle was restocked and reblued sometime in the last few years (stock work alone was $850).  The new custom Circassian walnut stock is FLAWLESS and is worth the asking price alone.  It has a gloss finish with NO marks or scratches at all, 18 lpi hand cut checkering, Ebony wood forend tip and Winchester deluxe grip cap.  The fit and finish/workmanship is outstanding.

The action is super-smooth and rifleing is great, but the finish does show more age.  There are some small pits under new blueing on the receiver (which is better than someone overpolishing it, in my opinion) and some blueing wear/pitting on the outside of the barrel.  Still looks great...I'd consider it about 85-90%, but it pales in comparison to the stock.

It has flip-up express open sights and has been drilled and tapped on the left side for a side mount scope.  The caliber in 30 W.C.F. (30-30) is quite a bit more rare in this gun, as the majority of them were 30-06.

Trades considered but cash is priority.  Not really into tactical stuff, but open to suggestions.

More info:

Includes 3-9 x 32 Standard Scope (not mounted). Take small game, plink or shoot targets with the Storm XT. This rifle sends .177 pellets screaming out the barrel at 1,000 fps! With only 28 lbs. cocking effort, this lightweight, powerful rifle is ideal for hours of serious shooting.

The hardwood stock on this spring-piston breakbarrel rifle has a Monte Carlo buttstock. Details on this rifle make it obvious that Crosman put a lot of thought into the design of this handsome all-round airgun. The micro adjustable fiber optic rear sight and fiber optic front sight ensure ease in acquiring your targets, even at dusk and dawn. To get the most accuracy from this rifle, mount the included scope on the 11mm dovetails. Don't worry about your mounts sliding off the dovetails; Crosman included a scope stop to support them whenever this powerhouse fires!

No I will not pay new prices for a used weapon and I know the proper prices and can post examples for anyone asking for two much. $50 under dealer prices is not a bargain for a used gun. Everyone on hear seams to think that asking new prices or higher is the norm. Used guns are NOT worth %100 dealer prices.

Original owner. Excellent condition. Looks new. Very little use (about half a can of pellets). All the necessary extras included (See list below). Here's what the ads say about it:

One of the most fun rifles you'll ever shoot! In fact, Crosman's 1077 was chosen for the 2001 Bikathlon Event at the Boy Scout Jamboree.

This 12-shot repeater runs on standard 12-gram CO2 cartridges and fires as fast as you can pull the trigger. The synthetic stock is durable, will stand up to decades of use and features a checkered pistol grip and forearm. It's lightweight, easy to use and will provide hours of fun for the whole family. Low on noise, the 1077 won't disturb those with sensitive ears or alert everyone in the neighborhood that you're shooting.

Just because this is a reasonably priced gun, don't get the idea that it won't hit its mark. It's accurate and will hit its intended target every time if YOU'RE a good shot!

The 12-shot rotary clip is easy to load. For even greater accuracy, you can mount a scope on the 11mm dovetails.

Here are the extras that come with it (ALL sold together, will not separate):

Half Can (approx.) of 500ct Crosman Premier Super Point .177 Cal, 7.9 Grains, Pointed Pellets

Crosman 12 Gram CO2 Cartridges, 19 Quantity left out of 25 Ct. Box

These pistols are unsafe to carry with a round chambered, and if you bought one of these for your wife or mom it's time to upgrade to a better pistol in a bigger caliber.

ONLY interested in one with a rotary safety (up/down, notched slide).  No interest in the ones with sliding safety (left/right, no notch in slide).

Specifically looking for NIB or LNIB with unscratched bright chrome finish and original box and manual at this price.  Would still have interest in one in Excellent condition with no box with price adjusted accordingly.  Might consider satin nickel finish as well, but much prefer an example of the MP-25 in bright chrome.  No interest in blued.

Absolutely zero interest in any other pistols at this time (unless you happen to have a chrome FIE Titan in like new condition).

If you have what I'm looking for but would prefer to trade rather than sell, I'm sure we can work something out.

Just found this website today while doing research on guns. I was recently robbed at gun point and luckily was not hurt. I have decided that I need a firearm. After doing some research I have concluded that I want a .38 caliber revolver for home protection and for conceal/carry protection.

I know that Taurus makes some good, inexpensive, reliable guns and so does charter arms. Since this is my first time on the site I really do not expect to find what I am looking for right away. I would also accept advise from others regarding what they recommend for my price range. Which my price range is around $250 give or take.
Thanks!

UPDATE: Thank you all that responded, especially Scott. I purchased a Taurus Model 92 .38 Special 6 shot revolver and it is a great gun. It is perfect for my needs at the moment.

This rear sight attaches to AR-15 / M16 flat top A3 upper receivers. The sight may be used as a back-up rear sight or a lightweight rear sight to co-witness with red dot or holographic sights. The sight locks in its upright position, a spring loaded release must be depressed to place the sight in the down position. The sight has both 0.199 inch and 0.73 inch apertures on the same sighting plane. This allows both apertures to be sighted to the same point of impact. The sight has four apertures so that rotating the dial in either direction brings the next size aperture to view. The windage is adjusted using a standard A2 windage adjustment drum. One click allows 0.55 moa change on rifles and 0.65 moa change on carbines. Constructed of both black oxide carbon steel and black anodized aircraft grade aluminum."

It is rare because of the Gold Lettering on it which was a special order from Colt. Last show I went to, dealer told me that the original grips alone were worth $150. I'm really not interested in selling it as I would rather trade, but if you feel the need to make me an offer, I will consider it.

Also included is a Schrade leather belt case that I found holds the spare magazine quite nicely.
This firearm works great!  I carried this concealed for a couple of years and to the best of my knowledge, I was never noticed to be ""carrying"".  It has a really slim profile (less then 7/8"") and is easily tucked into the waistband or pocket.  DAO (double-action, only) provides for safe ""charged"" carry status (one in the chamber, hammer in dropped position, no safety).  No safety levers of slide locks to snag on clothing upon draw.  This is a perfect law enforcement back-up or plain clothes/off duty gun.  Excellent firearm for women (or those with small hands).  Frame is high-tech synthetic Olive Drab polymer and slide is blued steel (very low carry weight).  6+1 (6rds in mag, one in chamber) of .380 ACP (Auto Colt Pistol) makes for a potent 'pocket pistol'.  Specialized self defense loads are available from major ammunition manufacturers.  Please see the Kel-Tec website for other specs. regarding this fine American Made weapon.
Some minor slide finish wear from daily personal carry.  Weapon has only had about 100 rds. fired.  Very good condition.

Before you totally disregard it for being a Century Arms gun, this one has the tapco trigger and is one of the good ones that shoots reliably and accurately.
It's hit and miss magazine wobble with steel magazines depending on where they're from, but absolutely no wobble with U.S. made polymer or bakelite mags.
I have 3 steel magazines and a tapco polymer one for it, only shot 150 rounds through it, kept it extremely clean since I bought it.
It has some wear marks and minor scratches from being carried around on the farm, but no major or deep scratches other than the safety trace.
Selling because I got it on a trade along with an SKS a couple of years ago and I'm not really into AK's anymore.
Only looking for trades right now, not interested in cash.
Comes with 550 rounds of Silver Bear 123 grain FMJ, non corrosive, good for target practice.
