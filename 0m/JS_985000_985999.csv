Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 15 boxes available. Price is $40/box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly.

It is 100% clean, no scratches, like new.  It had only been to an indoor range three times.  Comes with the original 30 round magazine and instructions.  I had the Bill Springfield trigger job done on it which really improved the stock trigger.  It has the factory adjustable gas, folding stock, midwest industries flip front and rear sites, Promag rail pack.  The gun runs flawless and I have not had a problem with it. When I purchased this I bought two identical ones and gave the second to my business partner for Christmas.  So I always have an XCR if I want to borrow.  I am selling since I just bough a full auto FNC and need to put it towards that.

I am the original owner.

This gun has a 16 in 5.56 barrel on it but it can be chambered for other calibers.  I also registered this as a SBR with the ATF for shorter barrels.  You'd have to pay the $200 transfer tax to the ATF if you keep that in place - but it's already grandfathered in the ATF registry.  Registration was for an 11 in barrel in 5.56, 7.62x39, 6.8mm Rem, and 6.55 Grendel.  I can take it out of the registry and sell to you that way if you want.  Since I have not put a short barrel on it yet I have not had it engraved with my name on it to date.  If you don't know much about SBR's, please go to the ATM site or hundreds of forums where you can get information in this.

Asking $1950.  You can check my feedback on Gunbroker with is A+."

It is 100% clean, no scratches, like new.  It had only been to an indoor range three times.  Comes with the original 30 round magazine and instructions.  I had the Bill Springfield trigger job done on it which really improved the stock trigger.  It has the factory adjustable gas, folding stock, midwest industries flip front and rear sites, Promag rail pack.  The gun runs flawless and I have not had a problem with it. When I purchased this I bought two identical ones and gave the second to my business partner for Christmas.  So I always have an XCR if I want to borrow.  I am selling since I just bough a full auto FNC and need to put it towards that.

I am the original owner.

This gun has a 16 in 5.56 barrel on it but it can be chambered for other calibers.  I also registered this as a SBR with the ATF for shorter barrels.  You'd have to pay the $200 transfer tax to the ATF if you keep that in place - but it's already grandfathered in the ATF registry.  Registration was for an 11 in barrel in 5.56, 7.62x39, 6.8mm Rem, and 6.55 Grendel.  I can take it out of the registry and sell to you that way if you want.  Since I have not put a short barrel on it yet I have not had it engraved with my name on it to date.  If you don't know much about SBR's, please go to the ATM site or hundreds of forums where you can get information in this.

I figure I would sell it if if I can get $2,000 which seems to be the Gunbroker price.  I cannot come off of that.  I believe mine has less use than anything on there.  I have an A+ rating with more than $25,000 of gunbroker sales, so you can check me out easily if you are interested."

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling

Manufacturer:
Mauser

Model:
P-08

Gauge:
9 mm Luger


Barrel Length:
4 inch round


Description:
This is an excellent example of an early 1936 production luger that was manufactured by the Mauser factory with the rust blue finish and straw colored small parts. This was the third year of regular Mauser luger production and the first production year to use the full date on top of the chamber area in lieu of the secret letter/date code markings. Although a standard production model, this series of luger is very difficult to find in original unaltered condition as they saw considerable use during the early pre-war years and many thousand went into Russia in 1942 and never returned. The top of the chamber has the full date of 1936, with the correct ""S/42"" code marking on the front toggle. The right side of the barrel extension has the early double ""eagle/63'' Waffenamt proofs, next to the single eagle firing proof. The firing proof is marked on the right rear of the barrel and the ""eagle/63"" proof on the left rear. The left side of the breechblock also has the single eagle firing proof. It has the standard ""GESICHERT"" and ""GELADEN"" markings on the safety and extractor. The matching serial number is marked on the front of the frame (with letter suffix), bottom of the barrel and on the left side of the barrel extension. The partial number ""41"" is marked on most of the small components. Blue unmarked magazine with aluminum base numbered to the gun with ""eagle/63"" proof and fitted with checkered un-numbered waInut grips.



Condition:
Excellent. The pistol retains 85% plus original blue finish with some minor muzzle and high edge wear, and a smooth brown patina on the grip straps and some minor thinning on the trigger guard. 70% of the original straw color remains intact on the small components. The grips are also excellent with a few scattered minor dings and nicks, and sharp checkering. The markings are clear and crisp. Mechanically excellent."

Please do not ask for the same prices all of these 91/30s are going for. You are not going to get it. If you want to pay that price buy one of the numerous 91/30s on here.

TRANSACTION/TRANSFER AT FFL ONLY,  THIS IS A LEGALLY REGISTERED FIREARM! 

I received a german parts kit as a gift a few years ago. I had the parts looked at and I was told the barrel was in great shape. So I purchased and registered a  receiver and had it assembled at Enterprise Arms. It is CA legal w/ bullet button (this can be removed if the buyer's state allows it)
The marking on it are 1976. It works like any good AK should. 
I stained the wood furniture black. It has a Polish wooden front hand grip (wider at the base for a better grip in my opinion).

1000 rounds of ammo (900 rounds of HP's and 100 round of FMJ)
Ten strip clips with NcSTAR speed loader (works awesome)
NcSTAR top plate with rails
BSA red dot sight.
Extra German top plate and plastic furniture (ugly but light weight)

Pump shotgun 7or8+1 plus best cash offer) 
AR15 in 308.
Money talks

You and I both know what this package deal is worth so no lowballers or tire kickers. If you want/need this AK package, give me a serious offer. I am not desperate to sell this, I love this gun and have no problem keeping it and passing it on to my future kids. I would love to keep it BUT money talks. For the right price, it's yours.

I may consider certain trade offers if they are good enough for me to put up the cash (like a bunch of cheap tulammo or wolf .223 ammo or an AR15 lower).  Selling for $150.  You can make an offer, but considering this isnt mine, I cant really budge much on the price.  $150 is pretty firm. Thanks for looking"
