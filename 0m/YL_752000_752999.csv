Para's new Power Extractor (or PXT™) eliminates the weakest link in the original design of the 1911.  The massive claw of the Power Extractor is 50% larger than a conventional extractor giving you positive feeding and extraction every shot.  In short, the best compact .45acp pistol you can own!

I love this gun. If it weren't for the whole new AWB scare I wouldn't even consider selling it. 

I'm not putting a price on here because I want to know what people will offer. I know approximately what they've been selling for lately. I also know what my mags are selling for. Please keep that in mind when you email.

This was not and is not a safe queen. This is a working man's gun. As such it has scratches and signs of use (but not abuse). While it is collectible because it has LEO restricted roll marks, it would be on the lower end on the collectible scale because it has been used. If you need a New In Box model, this is not for you. If you you want a great reliable firearm that has a proven history and track record, one you can rely on to accurately shoot rounds down range, this gun is for you.


The AR-15A3 model AR6721 is an exceptional patrol rifle with tactical accuracy chosen by federal, state and local agencies. The 16.1"" (40.9 cm) heavy barrel with 1 in 9"" (229 mm) rifling twist allows flexibility in ammunition selection. The telescopic butt stock adjusts to four positions to enhance mobility and fit to a wider range of operators. In position, the removable carrying handle provides an M16A4 target style sight adjustable for windage and elevation to 600 meters. Easily removable, the flat top upper receiver allows for easy mounting of optical, night vision and other tactical sighting systems. The tactical carbine is the answer to all the requirements of modern law enforcement."

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” All models are available in standard military Gray."

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” All models are available in standard military Gray."

VERY LIMITED SUPPLY OF NEW IN PLASTIC MAGS W/ CHROME SILICON SPRING. THE KIND USED BY THE USMC.

A battle rifle is only as reliable as its magazine – make sure the one in your rifle is from Brownells. When the difference between a “bang” and a “click” is life and death, a magazine failure is more than inconvenient – it can be fatal. So when we decided to build our own AR-15/M16 magazines, reliability was our first priority. Some of us have sons and daughters serving overseas or in law enforcement, and we aimed to build the kind of magazine we’d trust their lives with. We started with a clean slate, then worked out the bugs on the drawing board and the test range before we offered a single mag for sale, so you get a magazine of uncompromising quality and reliability that’s built to last and ready to run hard. When failure is not an option, these magazines deliver on the range, in the field, in a tactical situation, under fire. Load these smooth-feeding magazines to maximum capacity and fire the full 30 rounds you expect. No jams, no misfeeds, no hangups.

All components are made of mil-spec materials and are manufactured under strict, ISO quality control standards. The heat-treated, welded aluminum body is hard-anodized for superior corrosion resistance, then given a tough, dry-lube coating to eliminate the need for additional lubricants that would attract dust, sand, or dirt. The latest military-type, glass-fiber reinforced composite follower further guarantees flawless feeding in the harshest tactical conditions. Our new, high lubricity, dry-lube-coated chrome silicon spring that’s corrosion-resistant certified to 500 hour salt spray standards, and less prone to spring “set.” All models are available in standard military Gray."

It was given to me years ago by my brother in law along with some shells.  It has probably been over 20 years since it has been shot.  I took it out last week to shoot with the shells he gave me.  I cocked the hammer and pulled the trigger but gun did not fire.  I'm not sure if it's the gun or the age of the shells.  Don't need and don't want to spend any time on it so selling cheap to anyone interested.  Reasonable offers accepted

Description from manufacter:
This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.

Colt's M4 Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. 
- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components 
- Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm) 
- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness.

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in in length and weighs only 6.95 lb - ideal for tactical use."

I also have some very good ammo I will include with the pistol. Some is hollow point and some is RBCD ammo. The best carry Ammo is RBCD ammo if you care to look it up and see how good it is check out this link http://www.rbcd.net/Products/Personal_Defense/ and this link http://www.rbcd.net/Performance/Testimonials/#news17543 - read about 32.
If you don't want the Ammo you can take $40 off the price and I will keep the ammo.

This hangun is very easy to shoot, and extremely accurate. I have personally shot consistent coke bottles at 100-150yards easily. And have even taken a medium size deer with these pistols. Dont be fooled by false reports on the internet about being compared to a 22mag. Ive put an entire magazine through an old bullet proof with the sporting ammo then had every one of my  9mm black talons get stopped.
Cant tell you enough how jealous my police officer friends are.
This is an extremely devastating round, matched with a wonderful light accurate and balanced pistol. 

Whats better for home defense than a handheld mini AR-15.

Comes with box, side panels and multiple back strap options as well. Really nice pistol, I just prefer the longer slide.
The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

The SA-93 rifles are dressed in a wood stockset, while the SLR-95 wears polymer. These rifles have original chrome lined hammer forged barrels and Bugarian milled receivers, some of the best. Chambered in 7.62x39 and will accept all AK mags. A must have if you are into milled receivers or are looking for a base for an AK47 build.
