All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

Or best offer.

As times get tougher in the gun world you may want to consider this to keep your shooting skills in check, while reserving ammunition, yeah .22 is cheap but it is not  infinite.

Manufacturer:
Heritage Arms, they're a company from the south (yes, Made in the USA)

Action:
single (pull the hammer back each time to shoot)

Safety:
The revolver features a hammer block safety, great for a first gun, or when you're handing it to a newbie.

Condition:
Photos sorta speak for themselves, the Nickel is in near perfect condition.
Hammer pull is awesome and makes the famous sounds we love with revolvers, equally as famous as the sound a pump from a shotgun gives.

Decocking is sticky at a spot but is smooth (no pun intended). The gun needless to say shoots great every time, I have fired 1/4th a box of ammo through it and only had 1 failure, don't worry, the failure to fire was the cheap bulk Remington .22 ammunition, the firing pin hit it the same as the rest (checked the whole cylinder.)


Calibers:
.22 mag cylinder
.22 longrifle cylinder (also shoots shorts) 

Also includes:
factory box & manual
trigger safety lock

--- lets face it, no one uses these, but at least when the that state south of us (which is a sad excuse for a state) advocates we have their worthless gun laws nation wide, you will already have your trigger safety for when you aren't using the gun hahahaha, the lock is nickel also and would make a great gag gift.

contact me to exchange numbers, or to give offers. Trade or $.

Intrested in:
Mossberg 500
Remington 870
Glock 19 caliber conversion
AR15 caliber conversion
concealed carry gear or firearms.
Crimson Trace lazer sights

Will add money to the deal depending on what you have to trade.

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.

– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

If you love your guns and the week of thanksgiving has meant deer season for as long as you can remember, then listen up.     Please take the time to write your elected officials in Washington DC. in regards to the anti gun policies that are being pushed.  Please pay attention to what is going on there.   Even if you don't have an AR or an AK let them know you don't want your rights trampled on.  Stand together as hunters and shooters.  Hunting and guns has been a part of my family in this state since well before it had ""west"" in front of its name.  It may not come in our generation but if we let them start registering guns and labeling us eventually it can and likely will lead to confiscation.  Yeah, I know what they say, ""No it won't happen"".  I am sure people in Britain and Australia thought the same thing.  Write your officials, and tell them not to make hasty emotional decisions.  Each official is easy to find make your voices heard as hunters and shooters.  Don't think just because you don't have a gun on the banned list it won't affect you, or you don't buy ammo off of the internet, etc.  If there are more regulations on guns and ammo, at the very least it will raise prices.  That buck you kill each year will cost a little more until finally it becomes a hobby you just don't do anymore.  Thanks.

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.

The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.

I have a very nice New England Arms break-open rifle with a bunch of barrels and accessories.  The receiver is for large rifle calibers.  I sent it back to the factory to have them fit the additional barrels.  It has a .243 barrel with scope rail and large Bushnell scope.  It's a real tack-driver, with very little recoil.

The next barrel is a 45-70 that I had professionally enlarged to shoot 45-110 Sharps cartridges (think Quigley Down Under!)   If you want to be the coolest at the range, this is for you.  The shells are about a foot long (I might be exaggerating a little there).  They are actually just shy of 3"" long.  It kicks ""a little""!   If you are not familiar, the 45-110 is a longer variant of the 45-70, just a longer case but same dimensions otherwise.  You can actually still shoot 45-70's in this barrel, as well as 45-90.   This barrel has iron sights and is drilled and tapped for a scope.  

The last barrel is just a 410 for fun.  It has a front bead sight.

 I purchased/ordered this all new many years ago, and it sat in my dry safe 99.9% of it's life.  There is almost no damage, and I would say the bluing is 100%.  I also have an extra cut-down stock (for a pistol grip for the shotgun or a slightly shorter stock for kids), some brass and reloads for the .243 and 45-110.  I have invested much more than I'm asking, but so it goes.  My loss is your gain.

I do not need to go though an FFL, but I would like to see an ID for my records, and I would greatly prefer a CWP.

I might be interested in certain trades like large-bore S&W or Colt revolvers, interesting/unique antique arms, but no junk please.  Obviously for the nicer firearms I would need to add cash, which I could do for the right deal.

I would consider shipping, but then I would need to go through an FFL, and the buyer would pay all associated shipping and registration costs. For this price-range rifle, it would probably be cost prohibitive.   But if you still wanted to, I would box up and prepare for shipping for free.

I'm located in Skagit County (near Mt. Vernon, Burlington and Sedro-Woolley) 

Sorry I didn't take pictures yet.  I'll try to post them tomorrow, or I can e-mail them to interested parties (after I take them tomorrow).

Thanks for looking!"

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.

Going back to my ""1911 .45ACP Roots"" (yes - I know - going to be capacity/ammo deficient in a gunfight :)  So I am selling my Glock-19s and 26 to help finance a Wilson Combat, Nighthawk or Springfield Armory Professional and my precision rifle that is currently being built. I am a certified Glock Armorer and both of the Glock-19s and the Glock-26 have less than 100-rounds fired in each and are in almost New Condition. 

For the next 7-days, I have a 2nd Glock-19 (Gen-4) Gunfighter Kit#2 available (see pics) with same quantity and make of ammunition also list for $1950. Both Glock-19 Gunfighter Kit#1 and Glock-19 Gunfighter Kit#2 are listed at $1950 each, for a combined total of $3900 if sold separately. Contents of the Glock-19 Gunfighter Kits are almost identical with the exception one has Milt Sparks Leather Holster/Mag Pouches and the other has Kramer Leather Holster/Mag Pouches; each Kit comes with the same quantity and type of Ammunition.

For the next 7-Days will consider combining both Glock-19 Gunfighter Kits and all 5750 rounds of 9mm Factory New FMJ and 400 rounds of Factory New Duty/Self Defense ammo for a total reduced sale price of $3500 (a $400 discount) or will consider trade for a comparable priced Full-Size 1911 .45ACP Wilson Combat, Nighthawk or Springfield Armory Professional.

Will consider other Glock Gunfighter Package Combinations on a case-by-case basis, as well as other trades on an individual basis.

Note (1): Not all 9mm Factory New Ammunition has original boxes because for high round count training classes, dumped ammo in baggies or ammo can for ease of transportation, reloading mags and weather protection; 908 rounds are bagged separately 4-bags of 200 and 1-bag of 108.

Note (2): All Holsters are for Right-Hand

Buyer pays for shipping and insurance to your FFL; not included in sale price. Cannot sell to individuals in States that do not allow high capacity magazines.

PLEASE: Serious offers and inquires only.

Difference between Want and Need: I do not ""need to sell"" and can always use with my Students in 2013

Based on immediate availability of quality and quantity of ammunition (5750 rounds factory new ammo and 400 rounds of Factory New Personal Defense/Duty ammo), and 11-high capacity mags (21-rounds ech) and 5 standard 15-rounds mags -- this is a good investment.

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.
– Tench Coxe, Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.

SUGGESTED TEXT TO THE SPEAKER

Dear Speaker Boehner,

I am writing you regarding the numerous gun control measures currently being circulated in congress, and the Diana Degette - D CO, magazine ban in particular. This measure would place severe restrictions on magazines over 10 rounds in capacity. These magazines are used by 10's of millions of law abiding Americans. I STRONGLY oppose these gun control measures and this measure specifically. They do not make us safer and do nothing but disarm and hamstring those who obey laws, while criminals simply ignore the laws in their entirety. A magazine ban will do NOTHING to prevent crime or mass shootings which are a statistically rare event, and have essentially 0 effect on our overall violent crime rate. After studying the effects of the 1994 ban on ""assault"" weapons and high capacity magazines the USDOJ concluded in parrt: “At best, the assault weapons ban can have only a limited effect on total gun murders, because the banned weapons and magazines were never involved in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders."" The time required to change a magazine is trivial. I can do it in about a second and I'm slow. 

The 10's of millions of law abiding gun owners in this country are NOT the problem and we are frankly becoming very tired of being treated as though we are. The real problem is that these horrific shootings occur in so called ""gun free"" zones where the victims, or in the case of children, those responsible for protecting them, are disarmed and unable to mount any effective defense. When this is the case, the weapon used, and how many rounds of ammunition it holds, is frankly trivial. Any reasonably effective weapon can be used to kill large numbers of unarmed and helpless people. 

The short term, direct solution to these senseless and horrific acts is ARMED security in our schools NOW. Law enforcement officers are already in many schools and they should be in all of them. If the individuals who commit these acts knew that they would be confronted by an immediate armed response the number of attempts at these sort of mass killings would decrease dramatically. Compare the Sandy Hook tragedy, where nobody but the killer was armed, to the 1997 Pearl Mississippi school shooting where Vice Principal Joel Myrick was able to retrieve his handgun from his truck (it was illegal for him to possess or carry it in the school) and apprehend the shooter, Luke Woodham without Myrick firing a single shot. Luke Woodham's admitted plan after attacking his high school, was to go to the local Jr. High and continue his rampage there. Myrick stopped that plan cold. Unfortunately, there was no ARMED Joel Myrick at Sandy Hook. In another incident, in 2001, senior Jason Hoffman opened fire at Granite Hills High School in El Cajon, California. Hoffman wounded five people before being shot and incapacitated by, ARMED school resource officer (a police officer) Richard Agundez. An ARMED response to these incidents works, when it is in place. These individuals may not be afraid to die but they are afraid of arrest and prison. This is why they typically commit suicide rather than be taken into custody. The arguments against having the same armed police officers who enforce the laws and provide protection in the rest of society in schools are absurd. That includes the arguments against the cost. We could pay for an armed police officer in every school simply by cutting the foreign aid to countries where most of the population hates us. We have paid billions in aid to Pakistan, apparently, to hide Osama Bin Laden next to a military base. The money would be better spent protecting our own people right here in America.

The long term solution is to improve our mental health systems and address the real problem: The tendency toward violence in our society.

With regard to the Degette legislation I do not believe that this legislation should be allowed to come to a vote at this time. This is an obvious ploy to play on people's emotions immediately following a national tragedy. I am asking that you, as speaker, block this measure from coming to the house floor. The Senate routinely blocks legislation from being voted upon, in fact Harry Reid does so with monotonous regularity, and there is no reason the house should not do the same with regard to bills like this one. If the measure does come to a vote, please know this: American gun owners are a large part of the GOP constituency. You cannot win elections without us and as one of these gun owners I want this legislation defeated by any and all means at your disposal.

Sincerely,

All the following quotes are from Washington’s Bog:
Laws that forbid the carrying of arms, disarm only those who are neither inclined, nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.
– Thomas Jefferson, 1764
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.
– Thomas Jefferson
Those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who didn’t.
– Ben Franklin
Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property… Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.
– Thomas Paine
A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.
– George Washington
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are ruined… The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able might have a gun.
– Patrick Henry.
Are we at last brought to such an humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense? Where is the difference between having our arms under our own possession and under our own direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?
– Patrick Henry, 3 Elliot, Debates at 386.
The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.
– Samuel Adams, debates & Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87.
The right of the people to keep and bear… arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country…
– James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).
(The Constitution preserves) the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation… (where) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
– James Madison.
The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
– Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-B.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
– George Mason
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.
– Noah Webster, An Examination into the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution (1787) in Pamplets on the Constitution of the United States (P.Ford, 1888)
[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or the state governments, but where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the People.

What RUGER has to say...
The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles."

     If you love your Winchester your grandpa passed down to you and Thanksgiving has meant deer season for as long as you can remember, then listen up.  Please take the time to write your elected officials in Washington DC. in regards to the new anti gun policies that are being introduced in Congress.  Please pay attention to what is going on there.  Even if you don't have an AR or an AK, let them know you don't want your rights trampled on.  Stand together as hunters, shooters, and sportsman.  Hunting and guns have been a part of my family in this state since well before it had ""West"" in front of its name.  It may not come in our generation but if we let the Government start registering guns and lableing us, eventually it can and most likely will lead to confiscation.  Yeah, I know what they say, ""No it won't happen"".  I am sure many people in Britain and Australia said the same thing.  Get informed and then write your officials.  Tell your officials not to make hasty emotional decisions.  Each official is easy to find, make your voices heard as hunters and shooters.  Don't think just because you don't have a gun on the banned list it won't affect you, or that you don't buy alot of ammo on the internet etc.  If there are more regulations on guns and ammo, at the very least it will raise prices.  That buck you kill each year will cost a little more until finally it becomes a hobby you just don't do anymore.  Thanks for reading this please get informed and get involved with the political process in this country.  Your voices do count.

German GSG Sport rifles are fun .22 LR High Velocity semi autos.  If you have always dreamed of owning a AK47 but could not afford the now $1000+ to pay for it, you now have a suitable and economical alternative!! With larger caliber ammo prices going through the roof, and near unobtanium, the .22 cal rifle affords hours of fun for just a few cents a shot!! Great for inexpensive plinking, collecting or for tactical training without spending gobs of $$$ on ammo! This is very close to the weight & feel of the real legendary AK-47, and is an extremely well built German rifle.

The .22lr “Kalashnikov GSG AK 47” manufactured by GSG represents much more than a small caliber “knock-off” of a famous rifle. The GSG-AK47 is not only a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate, but it actually bears the name “Kalashnikov.” GSG is currently the only company in the entire world licensed by Mr. Kalashnikov to manufacture real, functioning firearms, and they have not taken this opportunity lightly. The low cost of shooting .22lr ammo is attractive, but not really at the expense of an unfamiliar rifle with awkward controls and an uncertain reliability aspect. Fortunately for those who of us who like military rifles, all these issues were not a factor with the GSG-AK47. The look, feel and controls are almost identical to the most heavily proliferated rifle system in the world. From the first time it is handled and shouldered, the heavy wood and comfortable stock length give the shooter the real feel of a familiar rifle. The magazine works and looks great and the accuracy potential was surprisingly well. Whether it is for los-cost training on the real system, a departure from the usual noise to give your neighbors a break, to help a youngster learn to handle this style rifle without the recoil and intimidation of the muzzle blast or just plain for fun, we think the GSG-AK47 will make a nice addition to any military firearms collection. -Jeff zimba, small arms review magazine

This is a $3500 retail rifle in yesterdays market in today's its way more. I just came back from a gun store purchasing a spare AR lower (empty and the only I could find in town) and DPMS parts kit and paid over $430. I also have mags and ammo for extra. Don't even bother low balling me I won't respond. No BS and no sell unless you are over 21, have a valid AZ DL, sign a bill of sale and meet at my local FFL shop period. No exceptions to this.

Look if you want it great, if your still unsure or your waiting to talk to your wife let me know when you have decided. If this listing is active then yes I have it. No I'm not looking for trades, specially if they are worth less, I'm not desperate to sell or get rid of it. I get so many emails and text messages to see if I have it then nothing??

FATAL TRAFFIC CRASH - HIGHWAY 260 WEST OF GRANTS PASS 
Posted: January 5th, 2013 9:23 AM 

Oregon State Police (OSP) is continuing the investigation into Friday night's single vehicle fatal traffic crash along Highway 260 (Lower River Road) west of Grants Pass that resulted in the death of a Grants Pass man. 

According to Sergeant Tyler Lee, on January 4, 2013 at approximately 9:13 p.m., a 1984 Toyota Land Cruiser driven by J, age 36, from Grants Pass, was westbound on Highway 260 near El Camino Way. As the vehicle negotiated a right curve, it traveled across the oncoming lane onto the dirt highway shoulder until it struck two large boulders. The vehicle rolled and NOVESKE was ejected. 

NOVESKE, who is the owner of a local rifle manufacturing company, was not using safety restraints and was pronounced deceased at the scene. 

OSP troopers from the Grants Pass and Central Point offices are continuing the investigation. Trooper Ryan Neuenschwander is the lead investigator. 

OSP was assisted at the scene by Rural Metro Fire Department, ODOT and AMR ambulance. No photographs for release.

ATN Mars6x Gen.2+ Night Vision Weapon scopes CGT, HPT, WPT Product Info 


ATN MARS6X Night Vision Weapon Scope is the world's largest line of professional Night Vision Sights, has a new flagship - the ATN MARS6x. Inspired by ATNimage 's quest for technical perfection and named after the Roman God of War, this ATN night vision riflescope represents the absolute latest in the world of Night Vision Equipment. Similar to all ATN Aries Scopes, the ATN MARS 6x features only the purest grades of heavy glass and computer-aided optical designs to create multi-element, high-speed, multicoated lenses for ultra-fast light transmission and resolution beyond current military standards. All optical lenses on the ATN MARS 6x Scope are individually fitted and calibrated to achieve optimum performance.

In ATN 's continuing effort to supply our clients with cutting edge Night Vision solutions we are proud to introduce a new line of select units based on ATN White Phosphor Technology (WPT). Studies show that nighttime scenes appear remarkably more natural in black and white versus the usual green. B&W provides clearer information about contrast, shapes and shadows. ATNs White Phosphor Technology provides users with this natural B&W night vision image. Operators that tested units that use ATN WPT reported a significantly better degree of detail, overall contrast, full moon similarity and range of shades. WPT from ATN provides more discriminating shades of intensity between white and black than between green and black resulting in better contrast and depth perception then when compared to green phosphor NVG 's.

M/40
9mm

The Husqvarna m/40:

Simplified version of the Finish Lathi L-35 built under license in Sweden. The pistol was adopted by the Swedish Armed Forces in 1940, hence the model designation m/40. Chambered in 9mm.

History regarding this particular m/40:

1943 the Swedish government started to give military training to selected refugees from Denmark to resist Nazi Germany’s occupying forces. The Danish Brigade was trained in secret until spring 1945.

The Danish Brigade was equipped in Sweden with 2,000 Swedish military pistols (m/40, without serial prefix, with the “S.S.” inspector stamp, and in 67000-6900 serial range) which were removed directly from Swedish military stores.  

These guns followed with the brigade through the end of the war and then were later transferred to the Danish police. Upon entry into service with the Danish Police these pistols were marked on the side with “Rigspoliti” or ""Rplt. S"" and with a serial number.

In 1991 all remaining m/40 pistols in military service were melted down as the transition to Glock’s was made, making this an exceedingly rare firearm. 

Own a WWII relic!

This m/40 has matching serial numbers!!!! The serial number doesn’t have a prefix which indicates that it was a regular army production and the number itself (678xx) indicates it was one of the 2,000 m/40’s first transferred to the Danish Brigade!

“S.S.” inspection marks on the rear of the frame indicate that this m/40 was approved for service by Captain Sten Stenmo in Sweden. Also, this m/40 is void of refurbishment or import markings.

The red grips, or side plates, are also a testament to the time of its production. During WWII black Bakelite materials became scarce so the transition was made to red, as shown on this m/40.  

After service with the Danish Brigade this pistol was utilized with the Danish Police. Also this pistol has the rear lug on the backstrap that allows for the use of a stock :)

Pictures don't do this m/40 justice! I have a lot of supplemental information on this firearm so please don't hesitate to ask any questions! 

Please make me an offer or if you have a 1911 I'd consider a trade."

Absolutely perfect shooter.  I comes with an aftermarket muzzle brake, polymer pistol grip, polymer lower hand guard(not shown), sling and ten proprietary 30rd magazines that are filled with 300 rounds of Golden Tiger FMJ.  That means it has the full military load out!  The paint job like on most VZ's is rough in places, no scratches or rust.  I'm not in a hurry to get ride of this rifle as there is nothing wrong with it and it's not taking up space.  Is the price inflated?  Alittle, but only alittle, add shipping, transfer fees, and all the time you could spend looking and reading up what to buy and where.  No waiting, no paper work, one stop shopping, makes sense to me to charge alittle extra for all that convenience.

No longer have the AR so I don't really need this any longer either. I figured somebody else would like to add it to their collection. This is a brand new, unused 100-round drum for the evil AR-15 sporting rifle. Includes black LCE-style carrying pouch, 2 tubes of lube/oil, loading device, instructions, and the drum itself with the smoked clear cover. As I said, never used. Looks cool and has been an interesting conversation piece. Checked prices, these seem to be going for quite a bit nowadays, sign of the times I suppose. Cash preferred but I am willing to consider some firearm-related trades:

.22, 9mm, & 1911-style .45 pistols.
Interesting/unusual semi-auto .22 rifles.
Etc.
Let me know what you have.
