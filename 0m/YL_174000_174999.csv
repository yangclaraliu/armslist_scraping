The self-adjusting Active Valve gas system reduces recoil significantly more than recoil-operated systems and a proprietary next generation Pachmayr® Decelerator® recoil pad is fitted to further increase shooting comfort. Trim grip and forearm dimensions add to the lightweight, fast handling feeling. The .742"" Back-Bored Technology and Invector-Plus™ choke tube system work together to provide perfect patterns. A unique gunmetal grey Perma-Cote UT (Ultra Tough) surface finish is applied to external surfaces for extreme corrosion protection, and the bolt is plated with electroless nickel for added corrosion resistance. This is one shotgun you must experience to believe. Three choke tubes and two stock spacers for length of pull adjustments are included.

This is a ""Universal sight pusher for most handguns with slides, it will adjust/remove/install rear sights and front sights.

The aluminum spacer on the bottom can be removed for tall slides and front sights.

You may need to shim the slide with a few washers to get the right height.

To prevent scuffing the slide I use 2 cleaning patches around the slide before clamping.

It has been used on,

and many more...

Keep in mind some sights are machine pressed and will need to soak in penetrating oil for a day, (XD's are one of them).

Sights are almost always directional, Be sure you know which way to push the sight for removal (right to left, left to right).

After being in the same family since the early 1920's Marlin was purchased by a conglomerate in 2008 and the New Haven manufacturing plant was closed. Marlin is now part of the same conglomerate that also purchased Reminton Arms a while back and has had the Marlin manufacturing transfered to New York. These early rifles will probably become colectable some day being the company was sold and the plant closed ?? who knows.

It's been a great rifle. However I've really become obsessed with getting a Winchester m94 chambered in .30-30 in time for the up and coming hunting season. So sadly I will be selling this trusty rifle, its accessories, and the surplus ammunition to make room for a lever gun.

DETAILS:

The Rifle: Manufactured in 1943. It's in considerably good shape given it's age. All cosmo has been removed. I've ran 200 rounds through it and have had nothing but fun. Let me know if you would like more images and I will be happy to accommodate.

The Accessories: You receive the sling, the ammo pouch, bayonet, oil can (pictured on my Flickr account linked below), and the cleaning kit which includes the multi-tool.

Ammunition: You get the wooden ammo crate, can opener, 1 and half surplus ammo cans (for a total of  706 rounds)**, and 40 rounds of Brown Bear 203 grain JSP.


** One ammo can is opened, and the other is still completely sealed. see photos for details.

Also I will throw in a free gun lock!


If you feel $325 is unfair, or you have a winchester m94 chambered in .30-30. Talk to me and lets make a deal!

It has a solid wood stock 5 round clip, bolt action,and a 2 stage trigger. The gun itself is in perfect condition. Its only been shot around 3 dozen times. I used it for range shooting, so its not been dragged through the forest with branches and rock scraping a crossed it all day. I have moved from my country live to the city,and no longer have a good place to range shoot. so letting my treasure go. the other nice things that it has is a very nice shoulder strap which has bullet slots in it a bi-pod with two  expendable arms. a must for a good steady aim. and the mother of all scopes.(which cost almost as much as the gun.lol) Its a Springfield Armory 4-14x56 2nd gen. government model. its hard to describe but this scope has it all lens covers, shade covers wind adjusters low light recital, and so on. it being a military scope also has the muli cross hairs. when you look inside the scope you see several dashes and boxes. you use some for distance. like shooting 200 yard you have a cross hair for that. it have lines and boxes for prey. once you know how far the item is you pick the line for distance and then you pick a box for the width. say you are hunting a deer. you know a has a typical body size  so you line the dashes up till the body just fits inside the dashes and you know how far its from you and make a perfect heart shot. it also has these boxes and dashes for several animals and even has a 3inch box which i found out is used in military for head shots seeing a humans eyes are  3 inches apart. hopefully you will never need those. but you do get a cool reaction when you show that to your friends. Last but not lest it all comes in a padded gun case that can be pad locked 2 different times if desired. This is an amazing gun, and i hate to see it leave but want it to be used and not sit in a closet the rest of its life. If you have Question let me know. to buy all this today would run you just over 1,500.00 dollars and that's buying from the cheapest sites on the web. feel free to look it up your self. Cz 550's are really good guns and are well sot after. I am asking 1,000.00 obo Thanks for taking the time to look."

I am a extremely safe and ethical person and respect not only any land I hunt but I respect the game animals I hunt. Honestly I'm not a person with a whole lot of money.

   I am a 26 year old husband and father of three beautiful girls (4,2,1) that I put way before hunting. If money is required I could probably come up with something, but I would like to find a nice land owner to create a relationship in hopes that when my young daughters get older they could come out and create some good ol memories. I'm not looking for land to hunt every day or weekend, I just need somewhere to go in season when I get time. I believe that nothing in life is free, I have no problem helping or working on anything for any land owner willing to help me out. Like I stated before I am more or less looking for someone to begin a relationship with. Thank you and god bless.

**UPDATE** I appreciate the replying about the Kansas WIHA. I know all about Kansas WIHA and that's what my problem is. I am just getting tired of unethical hunters during whatever season. What drew the line for me was last year I and a many times before I have been shot at because of a deer, pheasant, duck or whatever. I know CL is a long shot for trying to find someone nice enough to let me hunt their land but it is worth a try for the safety of myself. All of these out of state hunters ruin it for a lot of us residents born and raised here and actually care about our land and don't hunt from a truck.

The game I go for is mostly pheasant, quail, deer. I don't like using rifles unless the season is about up and have to fill a tag. Deer season is just too dangerous on public land during rifle season so I am switching to a bow and trying to get my deer before rifle season if possible.

If there is anything else you would like to know about me just haller."

I have for sale, a hardly shot (less than 500 rounds) Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22.

The rifle was $449 new, plus $20 each for the additional magazines.

This is the AR-15 style 22lr that shoots 25 rounds.  This gun is in fantastic condition, I have never had any issues with it.  

It comes in the original box.  I am looking for the paperwork that came with it but at the time of this posting I could not locate it.  If I find it by the time you purchase the rifle, I will of course include it.

Normally this rifle comes from the store with 1 magazine, but as you can see in the picture the rifle comes with 3 magazines.  Trust me, with this rifle you can never have enough magazines!!!!

This gun was bought locally in Fuquay and has been in my possession for about 3 months.  

It comes bone stock, except the 2 additional magazines which cost around $25 per depending on who you buy from.

I took this gun out last week and it fired flawlessly.  Once you load the magazines properly (Ill show you) you will have no problems.  I havent had a FTE or FTF since the first day, and those were my fault..

I just cleaned and oiled this gun 5 minutes before posting this, so it is ready to rock.  

I will also throw in a couple hundred rounds of 22 ammo, which is $18 for 500 rounds. 

The only reason I am selling this gun is I want to buy a true zombie killer, a AR-15.

The gun is not sighted in.  I had a scope on it and just put the stock sites on for the purpose of selling.

There are a couple of rules for buying that are not negotiable.

They are:

You must be a resident of Wake County, NC, and you must provide me with your valid drivers license.  
You must have either a pistol permit or concealed pistol permit.  This is a absolute must, no exceptions.  I must be certain you are authorized to buy a rifle in North Carolina.
You must be willing to sign a bill of sale which acknowledges you purchasing the rifle from me.
You must pay in cash.  Sorry, cash is king!!!!

You can definitely make the trip out to Holly Springs to take a look at it.  

The picture is recent, just took it after I cleaned it.

This is a video of the gun being shot last weekend by my buddy.  This is the rifle you are purchasing.  Sorry, he isnt a great shot!!!!!!

Great starter pistol or for Concealed Carry. I have bought a different CC pistol and no longer need this one. This pistol is in great shape and has already been warranty repaired by Colorado Gun Works. These pistols have a factory problem of a spring jumping out the notch that is suppose to ride in and then fires erractically. CGW has machined the notch a little deeper and then inserted the spring and staked it off. Unlike a lot of other Bersa's out there, this one will now fire reliably when needed. Great pistol, just not needed anymore. Comes with factory box, key for integrated trigger lock, external trigger lock, factory test round, blackhawk holster, and factory magazine. One of the coolest features of this pistol is that fact that it is a Double Action/Single Action pistol with a De-cocker. This means you can breach a bullet into the chamber and then de-cock it. So then if you needed to defend yourself it will take a harder, safer, double action trigger pull to get the first round off. Then every round after that is single action. Love this feature. Alot of your smaller CC pistol are Double Action only, of which is not nearly as accurate as single action. Email if you would like to set up a meet to look at this pistol.

The barrel is 27"" long from muzzle to front of the receiver. It has a vent rib and uses choke tubes (three tubes included). The gun isn't brand-new, but I have seen new guns on the clearance rack at sport shops that do not look as good. There are a couple of surface mars on the forend and a little finish chipping along the edge of the checkering in a few spots on the pistol grip -- neither flaw is of any significance. I bought this gun to fill my 20 ga. needs until I found the 20 ga. side x side I wanted -- I picked that up today and never actually fired this baby. She's a beauty. I have more photos that I will email to interested parties -- PM me your address.

If you're not familiar with this weapon, its a German made MP5 clone in a .22 caliber. The originals were so close in design, H&K actually sued GSG for trade dress infringement, after which there were minor cosmetic changes to the front sight and the grip. Otherwise, many aftermarket parts for MP5s are interchangeable, in addition to a mountain of forends, collapsible stocks, mag couplers, and even a 110 round drum mag available from aftermarket dealers. This rifle is bone stock, with the exception of a Tasco red dot that has been added to the factory rail. 

The rifle has had exactly one brick, 500 rounds, of clean running CCI Mini Mags through it. It likes the hotter loads, hence the ""HV"" (high velocity) appended to the model name on the box. The suppressor you see on the gun does not suppress the weapon, and is there to cover the legal length barrel, although making this gun suppressed and/or short barrelled is a breeze, if you have the means and your county is cool like that

 It will include one 22 round factory mag, the original box, owner's manual, tasco red dot, action padlock, chamber brush, a new .22 Boresnake, and a brand new Bulldog padded case. Also comes with about 100 rounds of mini mags and some CCI sub sonics. 

This rifle runs like a sewing machine, is cheap to shoot, and VERY accurate with the red dot or the factory diopter sight. 380.00 cash; 400.00 trade. I'm really interested in something in 5.45x39, or maybe 7.62x39 and will add cash for a good AK74 or Polish Tantal, but will entertain any and all military rifle offers, but, please, no hunting rifles or shotguns, thanks for looking."

(This is straight off Diamondback's website)
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380, a micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magaine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. 

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

It is an early ""Blue Label"" Colt that has a Threaded Flash Hider, Cut Bayonet Lug, and NO lower Sear Block from the factory. This Colt is a transitional piece. It has been fired appx. 500 rounds total. I have managed to keep it in pristine shape. You wont find the usual scuffed, polished hi-wear stock, scratches here and there kind of AR. This is a really clean Colt. I have tastefully added the same accessories found on the Colt Delta Elite version, being the factory cheek stock, A.R.M.S. mount and Tasco 3-9x40 rubberized scope. It is an absolute tack driver. You will be very pleased if you decide to make this one yours. I have a lot of respect for this particular rifle and took very good care of her. Is is a variant of the very rifle I carried with pride in the US Army.
