The pictures don't do this pistol justice, it is in great shape and I have only put 20 rounds through it (the original owner said he put 100 rounds through it). This pistol has been well cared for and like all Sccy firearms, it has a lifetime warranty regardless who the owner is. Sccy was founded by pissed-off Kel Tec workers and this weapon is very similar to the Kel Tec Pt11.

I would classify the one I have as fair cosmetically and fully functional. So for the pistol I would take $150 firm, in keeping with the current market rate.

This is a great little poket gun. DA/SA, Ajustable sights, threaded barrel for 1) a suppresor or 2) a longer barrel extension can be added. Have put about two hundred rounds through this gun with no flaws. Adjusted the sights and have it hit at point of aim at 15' in 2"" group. I bought this piece with a Walther PK380 as they were close in size and weight and the .22 is cheap to practice with. The idea was for them to be my wifes with the .380 as her CCW. Well after a lot of practice and training she has adopted my Kmber Pro Carry II. So I am selling these guns to reduce inventory and consolidate calibers. Trades are not out of the question as I am looking for two guns. Check out all my listings. FTF, Local only, Ohio Drivers Lisc. and billof sale for my records only. Thanks for looking.

a small spot of blood got on the cylinder. It has a little bluing wear at 
the muzzle. Other than that it is beautiful, and functions perfectly. It

Price: $950 cash or $1050 trade value
This rifle is the most accurate AR that I have ever shot. This is a DPMS AR-15 with an A2 stock and a 20 inch long, 1 inch diameter stainless bull barrel. This rifle has a free floating barrel and a free floating DPMS handguard, forward assist, and dust covers. The rifle also has a 6-24x44 scope that has not been sighted in. The scope has been mounted on a top rail scope mount. The rifle also has a bipod mounted. This rifle has a railed gas block and will come with two magazines as well. The stock has a few knicks and dings but nothing major. This came from shooting on a bench. The gun has been fired very little and hasn't been fired since I mounted the scope. 

I also have a custom saiga 12 listed. I will sell them both as a package for $1900 without the md arms drum for the saiga. 

Make an offer. Thanks."

This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. I have much more invested in this weapon than my asking price.

This is a great bow for people with shoulder problems or people who like really smooth draws and a hard back stop. Because of the large roller on top and the large single cam on the bottom it draws incredibly smooth- so it wont jerk on a shoulder.

Get on target, range, and take the shot in seconds—all without lifting your cheek from the stock. This M-223 Immediate Ranging Technology riflescope combines the speed and precision of a Nikon rangefinder with the accuracy potential of the M-223 riflescope and BDC 600 reticle. The M-223 IRT provides the equivalent horizontal range to the target, features one-touch laser technology that keeps ranging and displaying distance for 12 seconds with a single push of the button and an integral mount for Picatinny Rails. Part #8491 (Matte, BDC 600 Reticle)

BDC 600 Reticle

Developed specifically for the trajectory of the .223 Rem 5.56 NATO round with 55-grain polymer tip bullet at approximately 3240 fps, the new BDC 600 reticle offers shooters unique open circle aiming points and hash marks from 100 to 600 yards.

Zero-Reset Turrets
To simplify field adjustments, especially with the Rapid Action Turret and Nikoplex reticle, Nikon has integrated this feature into all M-223 riflescopes. Just sight-in at 100 yards as usual, then lift the adjustment knob, rotate to your “zero”, and re-engage. Field adjustments are now as simple as dialing-in your subsequent ranges.

Serial # 12209.

It has the thumbhole stock, palm rest for off-hand shooting, hook butt plates.

Also comes with the later model Anschutz rear sight and tube, Redfield International front sight with numerous inserts (inserts are Anschutz, which fit in the Redfield sight).

Has an Anschutz shooting sling, one forearm stop, single stage adjustable trigger, Freeland shooting glove, Freeland ammo box.

Also included is the period International Shooting Union rule book, several other NRA shooting books, several shooting medals that I won, all my NRA qualification patches  from Pro-Marksmen to Distinguished Expert for both 50-ft and 50-yards, photos of the gun in action during the early 1960's.

Rifle weighs 12-1/2 pounds without sights, palm rest or butt plate.

Bore is as clean and shinney as new. Couple of small dings on the stock, one  area on the barrel has the bluing worn where it sits in the fitted wooden carrying case/gun box. 

This is NOT some European shooting club gun that's all beat up that you see advertised on Gunbroker.

Last time it was shot was 1968. I'm the second owner and have had it since December, 1962. I have a letter from the Anschutz factory stating that the rifle was made in the 1959/1960 time period.

The circular ""California Rifle & Pistol Assocication"" vinyl decal on the stock can easily be removed without damaging the wood.

Perefer cash (I can do PayPal), but may accept as a partial trade a short barrel 12-ga pump shotgun. Perfer Mossberg with black synthetic stock. 

Time to let someone else enjoy it."

It has a life time warranty through the manufacturer.  I have about 300 rounds through it, so its about half way through the break in period.  I'm selling because I shoot left handed and I get blow back from the rounds when I shoot.

I'm looking to trade for an AR-15 and ill put the gun plus cash towards it.  If not ill sell for 425 with the 33rd mag or 400$ without the 33 round mag.

I bought this rifle new in 2007. It shoots great, and I have no issue getting decent groups on paper plates at 2-300 yards with the fixed iron sights. It started life with a fixed buttstock, A2 style handguards and standard parts.  The AK designation denotes the AK-74 style compensator/flash-hider. It works fine. Rifle functions great, and I’ve only had ammo related problems in the 1,500 rounds fired (i.e. cheap Russian ammo). I’ve just become bored with it. I'm selling nearly $850 worth of parts and gear with a rifle that would normally sell at $800 new.

Cash only and no trades. I'm reasonable, but no low balls. Face to face in Fort Collins or Loveland only. I will meet you at a range if you want to shoot it first. Buyer must show a valid Colorado Driver’s License and sign a bill of sale (CHP preferred)."

The ammo comes in 10-round boxes, with two 5-round pre-loaded steel clips in each box. The ammo was manufactured in Austria in 1938 - yeah, it's really old, but it's also true history - this was made for Hitler's 3rd Reich and has nazi proof marks. The wedge-shaped boxes are so intricate with sleeves and flaps that they're like a puzzle box, and have labels containing the nazi eagle over a swastika, along with other identifying info. The headstamps have ""1938"", ""VIII"" (the year of manufacture in Roman numerals), and the nazi eagle over a swastika. Each clip is stamped with either a nazi eagle with swastika, or an Austrian two-headed eagle, with the majority being the nazi stamp. The clips have finger grooves at the top to help remind the troops which way to properly insert the clips in the rifle, so that they don't get loaded upside-down"
