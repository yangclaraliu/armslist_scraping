Info on H-titegroup:
As the name implies, this spherical propellant was designed for accuracy. Because of the unique design, this powder provides flawless ignition with all types of primers including the lead-free versions. Unlike pistol powders of the past, powder position in large cases (45 Colt, 357 Magnum and others) has virtually no effect on velocity and performance. Cowboy Action, Bullseye and Combat Shooters should love this one! TITEGROUP has it all, low charge weight, clean burning, mild muzzle report and superb, uniform ballistics."

No sign of Finnish use.  The rifle has a very good to excellent bore and also the no import markings is also a big plus. There are very few non-import marked Mosins in this country and no additional ones will be coming in.  This is a much sought after rifle by collectors of Mosin sniper rifles.   This rifle has no post-war Russian/Soviet refurb markings, no import markings, rear sight doesn't have the cross pins that were added to most early 91/30's after the war, and overall it's in pretty close to original, as manufactured condition and configuration.

Everything appears to be the correct period and has the little Tula stars. The stock has a nice 1937 dated Tula cartouche, and has the correct screwed in sling slot escutcheons and hand guard with the brass end caps. Overall condition of wood, metal, and bore indicate a rifle that was carried and used in combat. 1937 is a very common year for both Spanish Civil War and Finn captured Mosins. This has neither the Finn [SA] or D markings nor the Spanish military flaming bomb proof or the ""MADE IN USSR"" marking that was applied to many of these before they were imported by Interarms back in the late 1950's to early 1960's period.

Summary of positive features:  Brass hand guard end caps, no import markings, original stock (not sanded finish) and Tula manufacture.

It is in a like new condition.

The AS trigger system of the Walther P99 has three possible carry modes:

AS Mode
 The first is the AS mode which will automatically engage after a round is chambered. The trigger is fully forward, as if in double action, but the striker indicator is to the rear and visible. This mode offers the safety of carrying the P99 AS in single action with a light yet long trigger pull.

DA Mode
 The second mode is Double Action. After a round is chambered, the decocking button can be depressed, releasing the striker into a double action trigger pull. In this mode the trigger is fully forward and the striker is at rest and no longer visible to the rear of the slide. After the trigger is first pulled, all subsequent shots will be in single action. This mode is considered, among fellow P99 AS owners, to be the safest mode to carry the AS in. 

SA Mode
 The third mode of carry for the P99 AS is Single Action. This mode can be achieved by chambering a round into the AS mode, then slowly pulling the trigger to the rear until you hear the SA portion of the sear engage. There will be an audio able click and the trigger will remain in the rear position. This mode will also automatically engage after the first trigger pull in double action mode.


I have the original plastic box, manual, and both of the extra back straps.


The barrel and slide have been hardness treated in the same manner that Glock has been, but Walther calls it by another trade name than Tennifer. 


I would like to trade for Walther P99C.

Roind count at 200.

No low ball offers please.

This gun is intrinsically very accurate it also has a set of Presentation Grips with a sort of Floral Design from the S&W Performance Center. Its slightly larger than the old style N frame grips and extends the grip frame about 1/2 to 3/4 "" They are in mint cond as they were removed as soon as I got the gun and a STD set were used for Target Shooting. Also theres 4 ( Magnaport ) holes on each side of the front sight pointing up and to the rear. S&W said it vents the gases up to help with muzzle jump and to get back on target quickly and to the rear to help lessen the felt recoil. I'll also give a hundred or so rounds with this gun, 50 target loads (very accurate) and 50 full bore 44's for hunting and can also supply more either target or hunting for an extra 18.00 per box. Guarenteed to fire very accurately. I'm asking 800.00 cash as I need the money to finish up my AR-15 and M1A. Not looking for trades at this time but would consider a good Tactical Scope of 4x12x40 or 4x14x50 No Jap or Chinese even thought about. Also want to do a FTF Meet as I want to check age and residentcy of FL."

In firearms I'm looking for a 10/22 rifle, or one of the AR or AK style .22 rifles, a .357 Lever rifle, a .357 Revolver, a hi-cap .45 handgun preferably a 1911 style but possibly other styles, a Taurus PT111 or PT145, a Keltec 9mm carbine that takes glock mags, a Mosin-Nagant M44 carbine, 'tactical' style 12ga shotguns, a Saiga 12ga or .308, converted or non, an FPK or PSL, possibly a bolt action in .308 or .30-06.

In accessories I'm looking for steel AK mags, AK drums, a rail that will fit a short-gas system AK, single-point sling, red dot/reflex/holosights, rifle cases, reloading equipment, magazines for a .45ACP EAA/Tanfoglio Witness full size, a .22 conversion for an EAA/Tanfoglia Witness .45, ammunition in 7,62x39, 12ga, .45ACP, .357/38, possibly 7.62x54r, .308, or .30-06'. 

Would be interested in full or partial trades, if the deal's good enough I might throw in some extra cash or another gun on my end. If you've got something else you want to trade let me know, I'll consider just about anything.

Each plate weighs about two pounds, very lightweight compared to cheaper (and less protective) steel plates. These will fit in side plate pockets on your vest, or in pockets on many plate carrier cummerbunds to fill the gap underneath the arm. External pockets are included (in genuine Crye Multicam) and can be attached via MOLLE webbing to position the plates exactly where you want, on any MOLLE-compatible gear. Email if interested, we can setup a time and place to meet - I am an independent body armor dealer, I can order other items and do large orders if this is not exactly what you're looking for.

Chamber is 5.56 NATO with 1 in 9 twist rate barrel. Some scuffs on the parkerizing as it was my truck gun. Runs excellent, will feed ANY ammo, is not picky. I polished the trigger surfaces and this really cleaned up the gritty 'combat' trigger. Comes with two 30 round magazines.

* I also have a stainless CMMG .22LR conversion kit with 4 magazines. $200 value right here. It replaces the bolt carrier and allows you to shoot cheap .22LR for some fun plinking or for the kids. Magazines hold 26 rounds each. 2nd photo demonstrates this, although mine is stainless.

* ~600 Rounds of steel case(yes, this gun loves steel case ammo too!) .223 62 grain hollow point Tula. Great plinking or training stuff.  


I'll take $1100 for all of it, reasonable offers will be entertained. Face to face only, will drive a reasonable way to meet.  Would be very interested in a GLOCK 27 or 35(both!).
I'd like to sell all of it together, but will separate for the right price. 

I live in New Bern, but occasionally am in Raleigh for business. I'll be in Raleigh through 6/17 and have everything listed above with me. I have the owners manual in hard copy as well as an electronic PDF copy."

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. 

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Both mags will be fully loaded with ammo.

It is in a like new condition. 

The AS trigger system of the Walther P99 has three possible carry modes: 

AS Mode The first is the AS mode which will automatically engage after a round is chambered. The trigger is fully forward, as if in double action, but the striker indicator is to the rear and visible. This mode offers the safety of carrying the P99 AS in single action with a light yet long trigger pull. 

DA Mode The second mode is Double Action. After a round is chambered, the decocking button can be depressed, releasing the striker into a double action trigger pull. In this mode the trigger is fully forward and the striker is at rest and no longer visible to the rear of the slide. After the trigger is first pulled, all subsequent shots will be in single action. This mode is considered, among fellow P99 AS owners, to be the safest mode to carry the AS in. 

SA Mode The third mode of carry for the P99 AS is Single Action. This mode can be achieved by chambering a round into the AS mode, then slowly pulling the trigger to the rear until you hear the SA portion of the sear engage. There will be an audio able click and the trigger will remain in the rear position. This mode will also automatically engage after the first trigger pull in double action mode. 


The barrel and slide have been hardness treated in the same manner that Glock has been, but Walther calls it by another trade name than Tennifer. 

I would like to trade for Walther P99C. Roind count at 200. No low ball offers please. 

Will trade for: Walther P99C, XDM, Kimber, Sig, HK, Beretta Inox"

The rifle MUST HAVE THE RPK RECEIVER THAT IS 1.6mm THICK. IT WILL HAVE A BULGED FRONT TRUNNION AND WILL NOT SAY   M70AB2T  on it. This is a version that has a thinner receiver and is designated by the T in the model #.  

 All the best deals have been here on Armslist but I cant seem to get any responses from many of the sellers about their items. Anyway, if you have this rifle, I hope we can agree on a price. I am also interested in any 30rd magazines  and/or a drum for this rifle you might have as well.  An out of state firearm transaction will be handled by an FFL, according to ATF laws.

And, last but not least, I will ask to see pictures before I buy anything, as you can imagine, through email or text, as either is fine.

If you like the size and feel of a 1911 style handgun but don't want to pay the high ammo prices for the .45 cal,you may want to consider this one.( I seldom get a chance to go to the range but prefer a revolver over a semi-auto when I do.)

Don't want to sell outright...would like to trade for a 22lr double action revolver in good condition, tactical type pump 12 ga. with the shorter barrel(such as mossberg),older double barrelled 12 ga.,possible other trades.
This has been listed for a few days before but didn't get the right trade offers.
      Thanks"

$225 and I'm pretty firm on the price.

I am a C&R FFL holder so I will need some information from you for my bound book ""dispositions"", but it's not much more that what would be on a bill of sale anyway. I'll also need to see a CCW or for you to provide me with a copy of a pistol purchase permit.

I also have a 1,080 rd tin of Polish Surplus for sale on here.  If you want both I'll give you a little bit of a break on the price."
