It has never been holstered or used in competition. There is a small mark visible in the pics on the top of the slide in front of the rear sight. This is not a scratch or scuff but was there when I got it. Overall finish is outstanding. If there looks to be any discolorations they are just smudges/oil from my fingers that the camera picked up. My crappy pics from my cell phone do not do this thing justice. It is beatiful. This is one fine example of the Perfomance Shops work and I would put it against any custom 9mm on the market. Just google it and ck. all the reviews. They list for way over $2k new. Take advantage of this great deal.  I am only going to list it here for a day then put it up on GB and the other Auction sites at a much higher price.

81,http://www.armslist.com/posts/346081,For Sale:  One-of-a-kind folding AK stock,"Sneads Ferry, Jacksonville, North Carolina",$ 120,"Listed On: Friday, March 23, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have to sell this stock because it makes my weapon illegal in my home state of Michigan. 

This stock was originally a Russian triangle folding stock that had to be riveted into the receiver, which also had to be modified with a latch to hold the stock closed. Many of these were bought by the state arsenal in Bulgaria and fitted into a receiver block so they can be a drop in replacement for standard AKM stamped receiver stocks. Naturally this stock has a longer length of pull than the ones that just rivet in, which is a plus for most people of larger stature. This stock is very solid. There is NO slop at all when it is locked in the open position. There is a latch on the side of the receiver block that holds it in the closed position. The fit and finish of the stock is typical of any product from the state arsenal in Bulgaria and especially typical of an ARSENAL USA import. These people make the best AK rifles money can buy and they make the best parts. I personally bought mine from K-VAR, ARSENAL USA's distributor. MIDWAY USA still has the last of these stocks and they sell for $160.00 before tax and shipping. Mine is only very slightly used and doesn't have any finish wear so I think I have a very fair price on it. There is no tax, shipping charges, wait time, or shipping hassle for this product, so taking $50 off is a fair price. After all it is almost new. 

 Price is non negotiable. It deeply saddens me to have to get rid of this great part. I will be adding a picture of it on my rifle soon and I'll try to get a close up. I can be reached at REDACTED

The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle. The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots. •Caliber:5.56 NATO •Barrel: Cold Hammer Forged Nicorr Treated Spiral fluted barrel - shaves 20% of the weight of the barrel. •Bolt:LWRC Advanced Combat Bolt •Bolt Carrier:Nickel Coated One Piece Full auto Bolt Carrier •Stock:Magpul ACS stock. •Hand Rail: REPR style sculpted slim-line, user configurable forearm which is 12"" in length but still lighter than our 9"" Mark-IIB quad-rail.

This is an amazing piece! I've only shot it a few times less than a whole box and stored it in the safe. It has never had another gun touch it in the safe!  This thing is ""FLAWLESS"".  Beautiful walnut stock with deep checkering that feels amazing to the hand! I can send more pics if needed but the pics don't do it proper justice!

I have only fired one box of ammo through it and it fired flawlessly. 

They no longer make this pistol any more and these German made ones are a nice collectable as well as a reliable and accurate shooter. This the ""PP"" version which barrel and slide is slightly longer than the ""PPK"" version and I havent seen as many ""PP"" either making myself believe it is slightly more rare. It is easily concealable making it a fantastic CCW especially during the warmer months when clothing is tighter.

SIG SAUER® P250 Wins Two NRA Golden Bullseye Awards 

SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year.

This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250® is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose.

The new SIG SAUER® P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber: 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select
 one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it’s a fully customized P250. But then you can change
 everything to meet new requirements. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance.

I had planned on selling it to buy my son his first deer gun,but took it down because I thought I had it sold.

It really is like new! I've got almost $ 1100.00 in this beauty!

The barrel that came with it has never had a single shot fired through it. It currently has a ""fully rifled"" cantillever barrel that I ordered from Remington before I even picked it up. I bought the Real Tree matching scope from Bushnell the same day and I purchased 5 boxes of Remington Copper Solids for sighting it in and deer season.

I sighted it in with less than 3 boxes (DEAD ON!!!) and never got a shot on a deer the only weekend I went out. THE GUN HAS NOT BEEN SHOT MORE THAN 15 TIMES!

I'd keep it if my son had a better deer gun,but he's currently shooting an old Mossberg smoothe bore 20ga with a bead...HE KILLED HIS FIRST BUCK WITH IT,but it wasn't a very good shot. If he could shoot a 12 ga I'd give him my old Wingmaster,but it's a little too much kick yet for him at 12yrs old.

I'd be happy to trade for a 20ga shotgun of equal value OR a legal Indiana deer rifle.

I picked up this pistol from a friend of mine who purchased it new in 2009.  It is in good condition and the gun is completely stock.  The gun was carried on duty for about two years, and has a small amount of surface rust near the muzzle on the dust cover, and on the magazine release button.  There is also a few small dings on the trigger guard.  I've included photos of these areas to try and show the rust and dings as much as possible so you have a fair idea of what you're getting.  Other then those issues, the gun is in great shape.  Anything odd looking on the finish is the result of oil on the slide when I took the photos.

Comes with:
3 12 round magazines
Safariland 6280-77 SLS duty holster (pistol w/ no light) MSRP around $120
Safariland 6360-7741 SLS/ALS duty holster (pistol w/ light) MSRP around $150
Hogue replacement grips (still looking for the stock ones, around here somewhere) MSRP $30
-----------------------------
So that's about $300 worth of extra's

If you're an LEO looking for a duty setup, hears one in a box almost.  Just add a mag pouch and you're good to go.

Asking $750 for the pistol and listed accessories.  For trades I'm looking for a P229 in .357 sig, and at least 3 standard capacity mags, we can discuss specifics further.

The barrel is free-floated (1 in 9 twist, 16"") with a knurled aluminum hand guard.  I had a piece of rail affixed to the bottom of the hand guard for accessories (ghetto grip, flashlight, etc).  It probably has less than 40 rounds through it (enough to break it in), and it is in excellent or like-new condition.  The optics are a Bushnell Trophy 1x32 T-Dot Red & Green Scope, with a Yankee Hill pop up front sight and a Magpul rear. To sweeten the deal, I'm throwing in a dark earth Magpul magazine that's never been used, two used H&K all steel AR magazines ($50 a piece at Midway), a vertical grip, and two used GI issued mags.  Sorry, I have to keep the sling as it was my Iraq sling.  If the price is right, I can throw in two 3 magazine mag holders with elastic retention bands for setting up a chest rig.  I believe they're made by tactical tailor.   

If you're unaware, Olympic Arms makes some of the best barrels in the business, and can shoot as well as you can.  I'm asking $950 OBO.  Serious inquires only please, and low-ballers are NOT welcome.  Prefer FTF, but can ship to an FFL on the buyer's dime.  This is a great gun, but I want to try the AK route for a while.

One if a Guerini Summit Limited Sporting O/U and the other is a Guerini Maxum Sporting O/U. Send me a pm if you want pictures. I'm currently in Katy, but I would be willing to meet up anywhere around the Houston area if need be. If the gun needs to be shipped, add $50 for shipping to your ffl.

Both guns were purchased in February of 2011 and have less than 1000 rounds through each and each gun has all three of the free guerini pit stops intact. I haven't used any of them yet. Both guns have very minimal wear. The barrels have no dings, but the stocks on both guns have just 2-3 dings from general wear and wear. The perlaged areas on both guns on the barrel that meets up with the receiver have a couple tiny spots of rust, but this is to be expected since it is naked metal. It can easily be removed with a little elbow grease and rem oil. Both guns come complete with everything originally in the case including the chokes, receiver sleeve, etc...

Some other common questions that have come up;

1) What length is the barrel? Both are 32 inch barrels
2) What caliber? both are 12 gauge
3) Where are you located? I am in West Houston

I'm looking for $2750 for the summit and $4500 for the maxum and both prices are firm. I haven't artificially priced the guns high in order to be negotiated down. The only trades I am considering right now are long range rifles, preferably a tricked out remington 700 in .308, a sako TRG 22 in 308, an FN SPR in 308 or any custom gun in 308. 

If you are seriously interested, please shoot me a pm here or send me an email at justinmoon at marketchasers.com if you wanted pictures.

They are all handmade right here in Missoula, with only high quality componenets, and they look great on your keys, or make a great gift for the hunter/shooter/outdoorsperson in your life. The brass is cleaned, sized, trimmed, had the flash hole drilled out, and a stud inserted, a bullet seated to correct length, crimped, and hand polished. The stud that the ring is attached to is mounted from the inside of the case, and cannot pull out, not some cheap eyelet screwed into the flash hole that will come loose over time. I also do not just drill two holes through the case and put a ring through it, I think that looks tacky. All keychains come with a 1"" split keyring. Also, any of these calibers can be made into a necklace with dog-tag ball-bearing chain! I can also make pistol calibers into earrings!

Only had maximum of 200 rounds fired. I'm big fan of .40 S&W, however, I'm not particularly fond of the double action only. Just not quite as fun to shoot as my other single action pistols because of the longer trigger pull that comes with double action. This pistol would be great as a concealed carry but seeing as how I don't carry at this time, my purpose for handguns is range shooting only. It's practically brand new and I have cleaned and oiled it after both times of shooting at the range. The MSRP for this pistol is right around $520 and I paid just over $500 for it about a month ago."

2)  Japanese Arisaka Type 99.....7.7 mm Jap....This gun is in good to very good condition, original sling, cool front sight and rear adjustible peep sight/anti aircraft sight...wood is original and not cracked which is not rare but less common.  metal is good...mum ground off (google it).  bolt is tight...barrel is nice....BUT....it needs a firing pin...easy and cheap to replace....You Tube videos on how to disassemble the bolt (only 4 pieces) and the pin is $20 to $30 online...these are known to be very powerful and accurate rifles....$100

Four rail DPMS Free Float mid length tube handguard. Weight: 7.7 pounds. Length: Extended: 35 1/2 inches, collapsed: 31 3/4 inches. Comes with 2- 30 round magazines, 1- nylon web sling and owners manual.

The rifle also comes with the Burris AR-332 fixed 3 power optic.  The optic reticle can be illuminated in either red or green, if not illuminated the reticle is black and always visible.  The optic also has a two inch sun shade that is removable and has flip up lense covers to protect the optic from dust and debris.  The Burris AR-332 is a quality budget optic, I zeroed it the day I got it and picked off targets easily at 300 yards from a prone position.  The reticle has 6 dots in 100 yard increments, so if you have in a gun vise and table you can really reach out and touch something.  I have had no issues what so ever with it and I'm very pleased with its performance. 

The package includes many extras.  The extras include: 6 Magpul 30 round Pmags (Used during the partial break in), around 20 +/- standard 30 round mags, three different Surefire Tactical flash lights that can be mounted on the rail, a GPS (grip pod system) that has built in bi-pod, and a box of federal ammunition that has over 700 rounds left (had 1000 when I bought it, so rifle has about 300 rounds shot through it).  I'm sure I'm forgetting some things but you get the picture.  This package has it all and if you were to go and buy it all brand new, you would spend well over $3000.  

I bought the rifle less than three weeks ago and have only shot it twice (about 300 rounds worth) so it's not even completely broke in.  I broke it in properly and used the Magpul Pmags.  I didn't even have a single issue with it.  I ran it very wet and didn't even have one failure to feed or failure to eject.  I've only shot 55 grain 5.56 through it.  From what I've heard the 1 in 9 twist barrel will have no problem shooting the 62 or 68 grain bullets as far as accuracy is concerned.  Not all extras are shown in pictures.  It's an awesome rifle and extremely fun to shoot.  Once you hold it in your hands you won't want to put it down.  Contact Brian with more questions/more pictures at REDACTED."

It has a round, low wall receiver.  The bore is bright, rifling is strong, and the muzzle has not been counterbored.  Numbers match on the barrel, bolt (electro-pencil), magazine floorplate, and buttplate.  It was imported to the US by CAI and has a discreet import mark on the left side of the receiver just above the wood.  I purchased it on February 14, 2002 from AIM, still completely wrapped with waxed paper and string from the arsenal, opened only where the import marks had been applied.  After debating about leaving it wrapped, I unwrapped it, cleaned it, and shot 20 rounds through it before thoroughly cleaning and lubricating it again.  It hasn't been shot since, and for the last 10 years it has been a safe queen.  The stock still shows light marks where the string held the waxed paper against the shellac.  The bearing surface which supports the bayonet locking device when the bayonet is swung forward has almost no marks.  The pictures tell the story of the condition.  Note the shellac from the arsenal still present on the sling escutcheons, the nearly unmarked bayonet lock bearing surface, and the light string/waxed paper marks on top of the stock about 1"" apart.  High resolution pictures are available on request.

FTF transaction only.  Must present government picture ID showing you are a resident of Ohio of legal age to purchase this firearm.

(If you are confused about all the $90 Mosin-Nagants flooding the market these days, those are M91/30 models with detachable bayonets. That's a good deal on those older, longer rifles. You should get one of those too before the supply dries up, like it has on the M44 model I am selling.)"
