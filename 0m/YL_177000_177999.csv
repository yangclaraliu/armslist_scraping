Description: Receiver - Strong, lightweight aluminum alloy
Barrel - Lightweight profile • Flat, ventilated rib
Action - Gas-operated autoloader • 3"" and 3 1/2"" chamber models • New Power Drive Gas System reduces recoil and cycles a wide range of loads 
Stock - Composite stock with close radius pistol grip • Speed Lock Forearm • Textured gripping surfaces • Mossy Oak® Duck Blind® camo finish • Dura-Touch® Armor Coating
Features - Vector Pro™ lengthened forcing cone • Three Invector-Plus™ choke tubes • Inflex Technology recoil pad • Lightning Trigger System • Magazine Cut-Off • Turnkey Magazine Plug

Camo finishes on today's modern firearms has nearly been perfected, if not perfect now. They adhere well, blend in perfectly with the intended surroundings and protect the gun from scratches, dings and the weather. The Maxus Mossy Oak Duck Blind does more than just conceal possible glare, shine and add a protective finish. It is the best camo out there, and Browning has teamed with Mossy Oak to produce the best camo finishes ever for the best firearms in the business.

The Duck Blind finish is ideal for the marsh, and that would include flooded timber, cattails, reeds, open water, jump shooting and even hunkering down against a dike among the rocks and gravel. This a light gun to carry long distances if you have to ride a bike or walk to the hunting site. It features all of the deluxe, hunter-friendly components of any Maxus model, including Invector-Plus tubes and the Lightning Trigger System. This is the gun for waterfowling, upland game or even sport shooting. The Mossy Oak Duckblind camo finish is coated with Dura-Tough Armor Coating. If you pick the shotgun up, it feels a tad sticky. Where you place your hands is pretty much where they want to stay. Not that iit is a tacky feel, but just a very sure feel. It makes the gun easier to pick up, handle, shoulder and fire. It aids in packing the gun and lessens your worries of any cosmetic damages. It provides a true outdoor-element shedding tool with a superior gripping surface.  You know you already trust the action and the workings on the inside, now trust the rugged camo-finished Maxus shotguns on the outside."

About the AK-47:
This AK-47 started life as unissued Polish select-fire carbines from 1960 where they sat until Century Arms purchased them. The Polish military never issued these rifles and the parts remained unissued. Century Arms contracted the manufacture of these carbines on new milled receivers with enough US-parts to keep them 922-compliant. These are based on the real AK-47 and not the commonly-confused AKM carbines that are riveted together. 

This AK-47 was Certified by Henderson Defense Industries where I purchased it.
The rifle has only 30 rounds through it. It has sat in my safe since. It is in mint shape.

Buyer must be a holder of a NY state pistol permit or holder of any other state CCW permit or be able go through an FFL. Their FFL must accept delivery from a private individual. I need to see a copy of the buyers FFL license. Buyer pays shipping cost of rifle to FFL. Ammo and mags will be FTF.

Please check your city and local laws regarding owning this type of firearm.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 +1 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns.  The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for male female shooters. From the very beginning of the design and development, computers have been used exclusively. All machined components are also made on modern high speed computerized equipment. Equally advanced quality control equipment and test procedures ensure a firearm with uncompromising quality in materials and workmanship.

This is a semi auto and holds 2 in the tube and one in the chamber. I also have a few rounds I will include. It shoots great and is just flat out fun. 

I would rate this weapon in 90% condition. All aspects of this weapon are in great condition. The only reason I'm rating this at 90% is because there is some design work that appears to have had a gold material highlighting it. I'm sure that firing this weapon has caused some of it to be knocked loose. If you look at the pictures you will see the design work I am talking about. The flaws I am referring to have 0 impact on the way it shoots.

I am asking $425 but will also consider a few PARTIAL trades. 

I am looking for a nice break action .22 pellet rifle. I will consider other break action pellet rifles and possibly a bolt action .22 rifle.

I am no hurry to sell this shotgun but if the deal is right I will jump right on it.

Great starter pistol or for Concealed Carry. I have bought a different CC pistol and no longer need this one. This pistol is in great shape and has already been warranty repaired by Colorado Gun Works. These pistols have a factory problem of a spring jumping out the notch that is suppose to ride in and then fires erractically. CGW has machined the notch a little deeper and then inserted the spring and staked it off. Unlike a lot of other Bersa's out there, this one will now fire reliably when needed. Great pistol, just not needed anymore. Comes with factory box, key for integrated trigger lock, external trigger lock, factory test round, blackhawk holster, and factory magazine. One of the coolest features of this pistol is that fact that it is a Double Action/Single Action pistol with a De-cocker. This means you can breach a bullet into the chamber and then de-cock it. So then if you needed to defend yourself it will take a harder, safer, double action trigger pull to get the first round off. Then every round after that is single action. Love this feature.

I was simply amazed when i bought this how light it was. it says it is not supposed to protect you from rifle fire or sharp edged instruments directly on it but heres the deal...it protects you against nij lvl 2 threats...and i can tell you right off the back that YES i have shot it with no one wearing it ONCE in the lower right hand corner of it with a .22 rifle because i mean you wont believe its bullet-proof at all if you held it. but it did not penetrate it at all and i am very surprised i guess it is truly bullet-proof. the ratings are weird...to really know what the vest will protect you from here is another link to a website explaining what nij lvl 2 will protect you from.....http://www.officerstore.com/images/nijspec2.htm 

on other notes, when I first received it in the mail off the Internet like i said i was baffled at how light it was and how tough. I stabbed the panel ONCE to test it while someone else held it up and even though it says it isn't stab proof trust me unless there superman and have an amazing leverage there not going to penetrate it.... the manufacture date on this vest is April of 2009. the damages are EXTREMELY small and minute if really any and i am VERY impressed with this vest still to this day, this nylon weaved material known as kevlar really is some new age technology. THE ONLY reason i even would like or want to get rid of this vest IS BECAUSE my girlfriend went to jail because of a warrant and i sold a BUNCH of my guns on here to one guy for the money to get her out. i am miss owning my saiga 7.62 x 39 and having my 3/12 inch shotgun....i should have never gotten rid of them, plus my pocket concealable .380 and some other pos bolt action shotgun.. the vest looks fine, the panels are removable you can not notice any damages at all to it while you have it on, and the damages that are are SO small that i myself will keep this if i dont get/find what im asking for it and hell i will wear it. you can come see it for yourself if you'd like. IT IS A SIZE LARGE or Chest Sizes(inches):L (46-48) says on it size LRC , it also has an extra panal that is smaller and another pocket inside that on the front chest area.all though there are no markings indicating what it is , i am willing to put my doaller that it is a lvl2 panal as well. THERE IS MUCH ROOM TO ADD EVEN MORE BALLISTIC PANELS IN TO IT.would be great if someone had some ceramic armour or wanted to buy even more panals to ramp up the nij rating...

I have for sale, a hardly shot (less than 500 rounds) Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22.

The rifle was $449 new, plus $20 each for the additional magazines.

This is the AR-15 style 22lr that shoots 25 rounds. This gun is in fantastic condition, I have never had any issues with it. 

It comes in the original box. I am looking for the paperwork that came with it but at the time of this posting I could not locate it. If I find it by the time you purchase the rifle, I will of course include it.

Normally this rifle comes from the store with 1 magazine, but as you can see in the picture the rifle comes with 3 magazines. Trust me, with this rifle you can never have enough magazines!!!!

This gun was bought locally in Fuquay and has been in my possession for about 3 months. 

It comes bone stock, except the 2 additional magazines which cost around $25 per depending on who you buy from.

I took this gun out last week and it fired flawlessly. Once you load the magazines properly (Ill show you) you will have no problems. I havent had a FTE or FTF since the first day, and those were my fault..

I just cleaned and oiled this gun 5 minutes before posting this, so it is ready to rock. 

I will also throw in a couple hundred rounds of 22 ammo, which is $18 for 500 rounds. 

The only reason I am selling this gun is I want to buy a true zombie killer, a AR-15.

The gun is not sighted in. I had a scope on it and just put the stock sites on for the purpose of selling.

There are a couple of rules for buying that are not negotiable.

They are:

You must be a resident of NC, and you must provide me with your valid drivers license. 
You must have either a pistol permit or concealed pistol permit. This is a absolute must, no exceptions. I must be certain you are authorized to buy a rifle in North Carolina.
You must be willing to sign a bill of sale which acknowledges you purchasing the rifle from me.
You must pay in cash. Sorry, cash is king!!!!

You can definitely make the trip out to Holly Springs to take a look at it. 

The picture is recent, just took it after I cleaned it."

I have for sale/trade a very lightly used Kel tec plr-22 which stands for ""pistol long range"" in .22cal. I purchased this new a couple of months ago locally.  It will come with the box it came in, trigger lock and tool and one magazine. I ordered the sling and forend offered for this pistol from Kel tec and they both look and feel great. For optics I chose the atn reflex which has worked great, kept it's zero and has lots of options for brightness and four Reticles. This is a nicely built , easy to clean tactical style .22 that's a blast to shoot. And cheap to shoot! The pistol will not come with the laser but will come with everything else pictured for $380. PTP or PTC required for sale along with bill of sale.  This pistol uses the popular AR22 conversion magazines, so it's a great addition to your AR!"
