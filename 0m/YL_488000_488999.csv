137,http://www.armslist.com/posts/488137,For Sale:  burris shot cam,"franklin (45005), Dayton, Ohio",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, July 26, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Trade for ammo 1000 rounds minimum 9mm , or 40 cal , 223/5.56 or combination of ar-15 mags and ammo , or 308/7.62x39mm , or a combination of the abouve please do your research on these they are exspensive and very hard to get  but it a must have item so please let me know what you have as mentioned abouve.

The moment you unholster, the Burris ShotCam with Laser (300225) automatically begins recording high-quality digital video and audio of events as they occur. Every visual detail, every sound, every action is documented for later analysis.

The encrypted video/audio supercedes any questionable, conflicting or biased eyewitness accounts and can dramatically reduce personal, departmental and jurisdictional liability.

Footage can also be used to help identify suspects who have managed to flee the scene. And the Shotcam, when removed from a weapon, can continue to provide video, still frames and audio of a crime scene and witnesses.

An ultra-bright 120 lumen tactical illuminator and adjustable class IIIa laser add utility. And the compact, lightweight Shotcam is easily mounted to shoulder-fired weapons as well as tasers.

Shotcam and other accessories mount easily to duty shotguns using the Burris Tri-Rail mount for magazine tube extensions.

Shotcam is also proving invaluable as a weapons training tool. Shooting form can be analyzed at the precise moment of fire and shooters can use Shotcam for independent self-evaluation.

Training Applications

ShotCam provides trainers a whole new platform from which to educate and demonstrate weapons handling and shooting skills. Using video or recoil-activated high resolution still photographs, a trainer can better assess a shooter's form at the precise moment of fire. On a computer monitor, the trainer can then show the shooter the effects of proper or improper shot execution. A shooter can even utilize ShotCam independently for his/her self evaluation.

Liability concerns do not start and stop with law enforcement. ShotCam can provide your best evidence when presenting your self-defense arguments in court.

Record the action on a predator hunting adventure for later analysis and to share with others"

I bought it back when I had a better job and had less bills. Impulse buy I must admit. It is a safe queen now and only gets taken out a few times a year for cleaning. Have not shot it in over 2 years. The pistol is 98% new. The feed ramp still has some bluing on it to prove my claim of limited use. I used it as a truck gun for a while but decided it was too nice to leave outside. Come with two 10 round mags, original carry case, and a practically new galco leather holster which was around $70 alone. I believe I have the original receipts to show this is a $900+ package. It will come with all of my carry rounds also as I have no use for .40. Price is firm but will entertain offers for trades or trades + cash. The main reason You can text offers and the worst I can say is no. Buyer must have a drivers license and be of age and posses a valid carry permit.

Looking to trade my Glock 23 AND/OR my Taurus model 605. 

The Glock is a GEN 3 wearing Hogue Decal Grips (G19FGR).  It will come with the original hard case, two 13 round factory mags, one 15 round factory mag (G22 mag, NOT a +2 plate) and an aftermarket 30 round mag that's never been loaded.  I'll also throw in a LEFT-HANDED Done Hume IWB Clip-on holster (H715-M W.C.) and a LEFT-HANDED Blackhawk Compact Slide w/Mag Pouch leather concealment holster (#42020BK-L).  I'll even throw in two mags worth of Hornady TAP ammo and a mag of Winchester ""white box"" ball ammo just to sweeten the deal.  The gun can't have more than 400-500 rounds through it.  It's like new and is just being used as my nightstand gun.  I figure I've got $500 in the gun, extra 15 rounder at $20, 30 rounder at $40, Don Hume at $30, Blackhawk at $50 and decal kit at $15.  

The Taurus is a 5 shot 2"" revolver.  It's small but it is a .357 so it's a little heftier than a dedicated .38.  I'll throw in a cheap RIGHT-HANDED IWB nylon clip holster, two quick strips and 17 rounds of ammo.  

I will trade them separate or together to trade up to something nicer.  Both are in great shape... The Glock is my nightstand gun and the Taurus is my desk gun so neither has holster wear or anything.  Thanks for looking."

Trigger Mechanism: Traditional Double Action with an Anti-Stress Mode

As the first pistol equipped with a firing pin lock, the P99 AS combines the advantages of the traditional Double Action System with Single Action Anti-Stress trigger. The P99 provides the shooter with a user-friendliness previously found only in hammer fired pistols. 
The anti-stress trigger makes the P99 one of the world's safest firearms by preventing unintentional ""reflex"" firing in stressful situations. The decisive innovation: When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon loading, the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot; not only in the double action trigger mode, but also in the single action mode. The trigger travel is .551"" long in the anti-stress mode (at 4.4 lbs. trigger force), preventing inadvertent firing. On all subsequent shots, the trigger travel is reduced to .314"" (at the same trigger force) and this permits firing in rapid sequence, due to the quick reset of the P99 trigger

It belong to a buddy of mine who passed away, so I don't know its whole history. He bought it used in the late 1960s, used it for a bit as a deer gun, and it's been in storage ever since. I've fired it once for function. Other than that, it hasn't been fired in 20-30 years. My buddy was morally opposed to target practice, and almost everytime the trigger was pulled, it was aimed at a deer. Based on the history and condtion, I'd guess it hasn't had more than a couple hundred round down the pipe at most and probably only a couple boxes.

This is a pre-1964 action with serial number 1508XX. The last two digits are masked in the pictures. It is a 1950 serial number manufacture and the underside of the barrel is also marked ""50"". It is drilled and taped for a vintage scope mount but is otherwise factory.

Fit and function are perfect, and I'd conservatively rate it at 95%+ overall. The barrel shows just a little color with age and riflings are very sharp. It reflects light all the way down the barrel and will clean up to be bright. I've never ran a brush down it, only a bore snake. Blue and finish are perfect with a touch of wear on the bolt housing from use. No rust, corrosion or other imperfections inside or out. Bolt has developed some splotchy light surface patina but will polish out nicely. Stock shows some very minor handling marks with none into the finish. There is a small chip near the buttplate that is easily repairable and a small spot of water discoloration.

Arguably the best factory bolt action ever manufactured, this is a very nice example of the Model 70. It is lightly used and aging beautifully. Give her a good home."

SAFETY

Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.


Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™

The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.


Loaded Chamber Indicator

The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.


Grip Safety

All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly

The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.


Secure Grip Texture

The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.


Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case 

To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT:  Six great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK OEM sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice."

My wife and I bought this handgun before our relocation to California where purchases of pistols are a hassle.

We found out after our purchase of this Sig 1911-22 at Palmetto State Armory that it has a threaded barrel: it makes it illegal to take with us to California.
We will therefore sell it for what we bought it for ($389, no taxes + you save the gas to go to Columbia and we give you the extra magazine worth $30, our stupidity for not checking, loss is on us) or trade it for a new or used Ruger Mark III stainless steel (will add cash if it is the Hunter or Competition model)."

It has a SWFA Super Sniper Scope fixed 20x42, mono-pod, and bi-pod.  I also have about 100 rounds of ammo and lots of brass and bullets for reloading.  I have all the reloading equipment brand new in the box.  This is a bad *** rifle.  My 100lb wife shoots it with no problem, recoil is light due to weight, etc...  I am just interested in getting a Yamaha Rhino or horse trailer  so I decided to let it go.  The price is because I have added the bi-pod, scope, sight rail and rings.  Plus if you try to order one of these they are out of stock at most places.  Serious Calls Please,"

Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

The stock assembly on this receiver is commercial spec. Although PSA is not as well-known as other brands, their quality is second to none. 
Unlike cheap guns on the market (which use cast non mil-spec parts), this rifle uses match-grade forged/CNC components, such as trigger assembly, lower parts, bolt, carrier, etc. THIS UPPER WAS ASSEMBLED BY TATUM TACTICAL SOLUTIONS, INC USING FACTORY NEW PARTS. The quality & fitment of this rifle's components is second to none-better than any other I have seen which is why I exclusively use this combination. Multi Caliber marked lower receiver, so different calibers can legally be used by simply switching uppers (if ever desired). In current form, either 5.56mm or .223 REM may be used. Weapon has never been fired. Some of the features:

If you will look up the recent model you will find out that this is a Competition 9MM with a Accurizing Barrel Bushing.  The only difference if you will look at the modern version the front sight is attached to the barrel of the Beretta, not Accurized Barrel Bushing.  
My gun was made in the factory as is with the front sight at the end of the barrel, or Counterweighted barrel.  I was told only 250 of these guns was shipped to the U. S. from Italy.  This as stated one of the best shooting Target 9 MM you will own, plus a collectors item.  
Would be interested in trading for a 45 Auto such as Kimber, Colt, but none of the less expensive 45 Auto's.  This is most likely the first time, and last time a collector will see the original Combat Version is what I read was the first name, then it went to a top competition pistol.
I would like to hear from anyone who knows about this Pistol, I am limited on my knowledge except for what I have read from the Computer.  Do not shoot Winchester Ammo it will not feed, but Remington fires flawless through this Pistol and hits the Mark each time."

Millett 6-25X56mm LRS-1 Long Range Rifle Scope, Matte Black w/ Illuminated Reticle BK81006 is the optic of choice for the long-range hunter, tactical operator and target shooter who demand the best at an affordable price. The extreme-duty, extended-range Millet LRS Tactical Riflescope is built for marksmen who are called to something bigger. Massively built with a one-piece 35mm tube and 56mm objective, this Millet Riflescope delivers superior brightness and outstanding repeatable accuracy with the largest long-range weapons, including those chambered for the 50 BMG and 338 Lapua. Precision controls with 140 MOA adjustment
The innovative design of the Millet LRS-1 Scope includes features found only in scopes several times more expensive. Today, most rifle scopes are built on a 1"" or 30mm tube, but the Millett LRS1 Long Range Rifle Scope has a 35mm tube for added strength, brightness and clarity. As 35mm rings are hard to find and expensive, the Millet 6-25x 56mm LRS-1 Riflescope comes with Millett tactical 35mm rings for ease of mounting. The 35mm tube offers added features that fit perfectly on heavy, hard-hitting, large caliber rifles used for extended ranges, such as the 50 BMG and 338 Lupua. Each Millett Rifle Scope is computer tested under recoil to assure the highest quality. The Millett LRS-1 Scope is at home big game hunting in the West, target shooting at long ranges, or as a tactical rifle scope for law enforcement use."
