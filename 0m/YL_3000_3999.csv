It's had 30 rounds down the pipe. It was cleaned after each shot for the first 25 and then again after the last string of 5. So it's just barely broken in. The only reason I'm selling it is to free up funds for another purchase.

The retail on this rifle is $1260 - if you don't mind waiting a few months to get one, they've been on backorder for quite some time.

I'd like to get $1,100 FTF in the Tulsa Metro Area. I might be able to meet an OKC'er halfway on the turnpike if needed.

The rifle looks just like the one below, minus the EOTech. It has a factory removable BUIS (it's hard to see in the picture). It comes with a hard case, cleaning rod, factory paperwork, 2 magazines, etc. - everything a brand new one comes with.

Trades:

I would consider trades for a JLD PTR91 (+/- cash depending on the model). I would also consider a G3 clone as long as it was built by a reputable builder on a stamped receiver (no cast receivers, i.e. FA91/Federal)."

Re-stocked in extremely rare Bastogne Walnut with 28 lines per inch hand checquering.  Bastogne Walnut is an extremely rare cross between California Claro and English Walnut.  It is a much denser wood than either of the parent trees. The color contrasts are of the brilliant Claro with the dark lines of English Walnut.  The blank from which the stock and forend were cut costs $340 over 20 years ago!  The stock was created by Jim Collinger, famed Mid-west stock maker.  It has two degrees cast off to fit snugly beneath the eye.  Bore has been back bored to relieve pressure of the shot charge and the forcing cone has been removed and polished out.  The barrel was sent to Herb Orr, world famous choke man and his ""Sweet 16"" choke was installed.  This Orr choke will place 92% of one and one-eight ounce of #8 shot within a 30"" circle at 32 yards.  A Tillotson Pull/Release Olympic trigger has been installed and the gun can be shot either way by releasing the trigger on the swing or the normal pulling of the trigger.  This is truly a one-of-a-kind trap shotgun!  Too ashamed to tell you what I have invested in this gun!  Selling for health reasons. $750.00"

I am asking 250 obo; these stocks improve accuracy and precision at a cost of 428.00 with out tax. 
Here is some info on the stock:
H-S Precision sets the standard in performance and quality when it comes to stocks. Each stock features a 3-piece design. At the heart of every H-S Precision Stock is a CAD/CAM designed CNC machined aluminum bedding block chassis. The shell of each stock is comprised of woven KevlarT cloth, woven fiberglass cloth, uni-directional carbon fiber, an epoxy-based gel coat and a laminating resin. The core of the stock is reaction-injection-molded polyurethane foam and reinforced with fiberglass. The aluminum bedding block requires a simple tightening of the bedding screws to secure the action to the bedding block. No messy bedding compounds or time consuming work involved. Stock include an Uncle Mike's recoil pad as well as Uncle Mike's sling swivel studs.

G2 double hook trigger group with retention plate installed an polished by Chris with AK builder.

I also have original slant break and synthetic furniture if you wanted to convert it back.

I hate that I have to sell this because chances are I will have a hard time replacing it in the future. This rifle is in pristine condition and has one of the best trigger's I have felt. I bought this rifle new and have shot less than 150 rounds, and it has been babied.

May consider partial trade for nice unmolested glock 17 or 26.

This is a factory refurbished gun. I do not know the extent of the refurb work. My assumption is this was a police trade-in at some point, and Glock cleans them up to then re-sale. The gun does not show any P.D. markings, so I can't verify this. They repackage them with everything you would receive new...pad-lock, mag loader, 2-17 round magazines, cleaning tool and brush, in a case. The gun has the Glock life-time warranty. The gun has Tritium night sites-they still glow--but they are NOT life-time guaranteed. The gun does show minimal markings & scuffs--like holster wear, etc...there are a few rubs here and there (shiny spots?). Its hard to show this in the pictures. I would say compared side-by-side with a NEW 17-this one will not look as clean. I have fired 34 rounds (two mags worth) through the gun. The gun is a little too light for taste.
