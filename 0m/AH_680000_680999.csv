This is a classic Browning shotgun.  2 3/4 chamber, 28"" Barrel, full choke, nice walnut stock.  I bought this from my father in-law to shoot trap at the local range.  Unfortunately for me the gas system in the 2000 is not rated for the low power loads of the cheap trap shells.  The gun reliably cycles hunting loads just fine - I just don't think that the designers at Browning had the low-power loads in mind when they designed gas system.

So my loss is your gain - this is a beautiful and very nice hunting gun.  And since I already own a few hunting shotguns I am not in need of another one.

Cash takes it.  I am being honest in the description of this gun so please be honest with me when we talk $$.  Price to be agreed on and stuck to before we meet - I won't waste time on people that try to low ball me when we meet so please don't bother."

The 4006 is a great gun, just too damn big for concealing. Gun will come with a handgun case, canvas holster, two magazines, night sights, and whatever ammo I have left at the time of the trade.

The downside; The magazines have a tendency to jam when you put more than 9 rounds in them (they hold 11). I think the springs are bad, but since it can shoot 9 no problem, I never bothered to fix/replace them. 

I bought the gun used from Shooter Shop in West Allis back in 2004 or 2005, and was told it was a used gun from a law enforcement agency in Florida. The gun is in pretty good shape for its age/use.

Lastly, while I'm not a police officer, I do work for a local law enforcement agency and will not work any deals with people that come across as sketchy/suspicious to me. My main priority is safety, and making sure whoever takes over ownership of my gun has that same priority."

It’s been a safe queen since I bought it - less than 100 rounds through with ZERO issues.  To put it bluntly, it’s a superb example of what a 1911 can be. However, I would rather have the money I have tied up in this for other things so I think it’s time to let it go.	

From Ed Brown’s Website: The Executive Target is essentially the Executive Elite modified for precise target and range work. Instead of fixed night sights, it has night sights with an adjustable rear night sight. The top of the slide has been flattened and finely grooved at 40 LPI, which naturally guides your eye to the front sight and eliminates distracting glare. Known as our best firearm for target shooting, this elegant design has a beautiful simplicity that has yet to be matched. Unique with the Executive series pistols is the 25 LPI checkered frame and mainspring housing. This pattern is not too rough on the hands, but not too fine for a secure grip. The timeless design reflects the genius of John Browning with modern flair. The Executive Target is truly at the top of it's field.	

The Executive Target features the following:

    5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy.

    Weight: approximately 38 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted.

    Exclusive 25 LPI checkering on forestrap and mainspring housing.

    Matte finished slide for low glare, with traditional ""square cut"" serrations on rear of slide only, top of slide is flattened and finely grooved at 40 LPI.

    Adjustable rear sight buried deep into slide, cross dovetail front sight.

My version of this 1911 is done in stainless/stainless with bobtail conversion and almost every other option available at the time of manufacture (2009) with VG Operators grips (rather than standard cocobolo).  Starring price for the base model is $2,895 and my version has almost $1,000 in options. Fjestad BBoGV (assuming 98-100% finish) puts the value, with options at approximately $3.365.

I am asking $3,100 (I'm not interested in any trades as that would defeat my purpose in selling!).

The finish is flawless except for, I’m ashamed to say, a very minor idiot scratch at the slide stop. The gun comes with the Ed Brown bag, four magazines, and all the original paperwork other included goodies. If you would like further pictures just ask and I'll either post here or email/text them to you. Likewise, if you are in the greater Nashville area and would like to examine the firearm in person I'm sure we can arrange that as well.

Truly serious inquires only, please.  Although not required, I would prefer selling only to an HCP holder and I do require that we execute a standard, private party firearms transfer form.

I’m willing to meet halfway between Nashville/Memphis or Nashville/Knoxville. I will likely be listing this on other sites so first firm offer accepted gets it. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have, either her or by PM.

Clearly, this example of a very high-end custom built 1911 is not for everybody but I'm sure there are many out there who can appreciate this weapon for what it is.  Thank you for taking the time to look!"

Over the past dozen years, I've used it for Bullseye, Falling Plates, STEEL, and general practice plinking. IT'S EASY TO CLEAN AND CHANGE BARRELS, so I can honestly say that it has been cleaned after EVERY USE. IT LOOKS LIKE NEW (except for the well worn finish on the magazines). Sorry, I can't do pictures but the 5 1/2"" heavy barrel can be seen in other ads, the 7"" barrel is thinner and about the same weight so it feels the same however you shoot it.
