I would say a very fair price is $750.  The 30 rnd Magpuls go for about $18 at the Armory, so I put them at about $15 apiece used.  Finally, the EoTech is a genuine top of the line 553.  It goes for about $600 new, so I'll ballpark it at about $450.  The total on this package (as I see it) is right at about $1,200.  But I am not interested in selling outright.

Do you need personal protection during these uncertain times?  Don't have thousands to spend on new plates and a carrier?  I offer an affordable and functional solution.

  These armor sets were commonly referred to, by helicopter air crews, as ""chicken plates"".  They are capable of protecting against multiple hits from 7.62mm caliber weapons.  I have experimented with a few sets and found that they can sustain multiple hits from 5.56mm and even 6.5mm rounds, without penetrating the inner layers.

  The plates are ceramic with what I think is a Kevlar outer-layer and the edges are protected with rubber guards to prevent damage.

  The carriers aren't anything special, just padded O.D. green cotton/nylon with button fasteners on the shoulder straps and a Velcro cummerbund.  They are not like the newer types of carriers with PALS webbing, but they work very well with tactical vests and chest rigs.

  These plates are quite heavy compared to more contemporary styles, but they weren't designed for lots of mobility.  I estimate a complete set to weigh around 20 lbs.  A healthy adult male wouldn't have any problem wearing these for extended periods.  Those of you who remember the old ""Ranger Body Armor"", will be familiar with the weight and wear-ability of this armor, as the two are very similar.

  I acquired these plates and carriers from a DRMO warehouse in Germany about 5 years ago.  These sets are no longer issued to active duty units.  They have been stored indoors since I received them and have been handled carefully during moves.  There are slight cosmetic variances between the sets, but all appear to be serviceable.

  The plates WILL fit in some newer plate carriers.

  They aren't pretty or as cool as newer systems, but they DO stop bullets and are much more affordable than new styles.

    I have multiple sets of sized medium and large.

And since the AR15 is now the ""BAD GUN"" in the view of the nation, they seemed to have shot up in price.  So now I am bringing them out and seeing what I can get for them.  

The first lower receiver comes with FDE (Flat Dark Earth) furniture by MAGPUL.  The 6-position MOE buttstock and the MOW pistol grip.  This lower is also equipped with a MAGPUL ambi sling adapter and a KNS hammer & trigger pin system.

The lnext lower has a standard M4 black 6-position buttstock and an ERGO grip.

Next you will see 3 FDE (flat dark earth) magazines made by MAGPUL (the PMAGS).  2 have windows and 1 is basic.  Then you will see 4 black PMAGS (made by MAGPUL).  2 have windows and 2 do not.  3 of these magazines (black ones) have the RANGER bases.

Next question....what are YOU willing to give for one of these lowers and/or magazines???  I also have 20 standard GI 30-round magazines with either the green follower or the MAGPUL anti-tilt followers (in orange)."

Made in the same factory the military AK's are made. No cheap WASR or similar.

Has a scope rail with scope, quad rail, adjustable stock and 2 clips. Can't even find these for some reason. I have had it about 2 years, shoots straight and very accurate for this caliber. You can easily blow out the target center at 100 yards, and I have done well at 300 yards.

It also has epoxy coating making the thing darned near indestructable. Comes with 2 mags, one was painted but is a Magpul, the other is an AK metal clip both 30 round. 

Also has an adjustable pop out bipod that attaches to the front rail and pops out with a switch. The laser is not included.

Quad rail ran $125, top rail ran $75, scope is a Japanese optics from an older rifle I had, but works fine. Pop out Bipod runs around $50 bucks, and the stock ran 120 dollars. I will also include the original front grip and butt stock if you like. 

Everyplace is out of stock and my guess is when new ones come online they will be the cheaper versions not an Izmash made rifle. Wouldn't surprise me if these things jumped another 500 bucks in a week or two, 2 weeks back you could get a barebones model for 500-550.

This gun has had less than 200 rounds through it and is in great shape.  It includes the original box, manual and the 30 round magazine in the picture.

These were on the last ban list and they will certainly be on this ban list.  The PLR-16 is smaller than an AR-15 pistol because it uses a piston system and doesn't need a buffer tube.  You get a lot of firepower in a small package."

This ammo is brass cased and cordite primed (corrosive). The brass has some tarnish on it, but I have found no pitting on any of the rounds I've examined. I see know reason to believe it will not shoot fine (I've set aside more of this ammo for myself and do plan on shooting it). See attached pictures.

.303 ammo is difficult to find and the Iraqi surplus is especially so. The only local shop here that has any .303 in stock is at $40 for a box of 20 new manufactured rounds. New manufacture ammo is not corrosive so I'm not expecting anywhere near that, but I'm also not planning on giving this ammo away."

With the scope and the BOSS system, this thing is a complete tack driver and would look great in a gun display cabinet.

All it does at my house though is sit in it's case under the bed, and it's too pretty to relegate to that kind of life.
The plastic gun case will included with the sale to help you get it home without scratching the beautiful rifle.  I also have some extra rounds that wil be included.

This is new 2012 manufacture ammo. Also included is a new, water tight ammo can and 5 new Tapco 30 round mags. Since these have become hard to find, I'm putting a trade value of $600 on this package. That's approximately $0.90 per round, $25 per mag and $25 for the ammo can. It's a good deal considering anywhere you can find it in stock wants $1 - $2 per round. Not looking for cash as the dollar is so weak. Won't buy much in the near future in regard to dairy/food, gas, etc. Thanks for looking :-)

If you’re on a quest for a production rifle that delivers hard-to-beat accuracy right out of the box, your search is over. Each Weatherby Vanguard Series 2 rifle is guaranteed to shoot a three-shot group of .99"" or less at 100 yards when used with specified Weatherby factory or premium ammunition. That’s sub-MOA accuracy from a rifle that costs far less than what you’d pay for a custom-made gun to deliver the same kind of performance. The 24"" barrel and other metal components are bead blasted in a matte blued finish to minimize glare. A three-position safety enhances safe operation. The match-quality, two-stage trigger is creep-free and adjusts down to a 2.5-lb. pull. An all-weather, lightweight, composite Griptonite™ stock features a pistol grip, forend inserts and a right-side palm swell to optimize shooter control and comfort.

This gun is perfect for the long range enthusiast.  If you can see it in the scope, you can reach out and touch it with a bullet.  The 6.5x55 is similar to the .308 but has a flatter bullet arc, giving the shooter consistent accuracy over different distances.  This gun will provide the shooter with the precision accuracy demanded by top notch shooters.

The rifle that I am selling is a SOG Defender.  It is a M4 style AR15 style personal protection rifle.  It is made in the USA in Houston Texas and is a very nicely built gun.  Some say they are a bit overpriced, but I think the fit an function makes it worth the extra few bucks.

My gun comes with 8 mags and 240 rounds. I am willing to trade in your favor. 

Nothing is wrong with my gun, I only want a WASR because I have a lot of 7.62 left over from an SKS I sold. The reason I'm wanting a WASR is because they are the most common. I'm open to any 7.62x39 AK. 

I would trade for a WASR10 with wood furniture at least 2 mags and some ammo. Which is a heck of a deal seeing as the century 74s are generally $100-$200 more than century WASRs.
