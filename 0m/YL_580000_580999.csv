Only 20 slugs have been shot through this gun!

Just google it, read the reviews and see for yourself.

Again, in 2006, the Panther LR-308AP4 earned the NRA Publication's magazine ""American Rifleman"" Golden Bullseye Award for ""Rifle of the Year"".  

In order to meet the requirements for the Army's Semi-Automatic Sniper System (SASS), DPMS added a brass deflector to the new generation LR-308 and incorporated the now-familiar forward assist into the backside of the brass deflector. Unlike the AR-15/M16A2 design, the AP4 LR-308 forward assist engages the flat surface on the back of the enlarged bolt carrier rather than a series of cuts milled into the side of the carrier.

The AP4 LR-308's barrel is of 4140 chrome-moly steel.  Underneath the ribbed aluminum free-float handguard, however, the barrel has a heavy profile, measuring nearly an inch in diameter, which accounts for its famed accuracy.

In short, this is one very capable battle rifle with enough mags to fill up your tactical vest.  Included is the AP4; 9 Magazines; Bayonet Lug Bipod; and Sling (no ammo included).  Actual shipping charges via UPS from zip code 75801.  Payment can be by cleared personal check; postal money order; or paypal.  Enjoy!!!"

REDACTED

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

There are 485 in a box with no markings.
Update:thanks to a knowledgable replier I have the below findings:
The ammo is 7.62 x 39; manufactured at an unknown factory in the Peoples Republic of China.   They are probably 122 gr FMJ, or 125 gr FMJ.   This is the ammo that the Chinese used in their SKS and AK-47 clones.
....We now have been told they are worth $150 so either a cash offer is acceptable or a trade for a Walther PP (>?) .22 or a .22 bullet rifle is also OK."

Brand new in box with 2-15 round mags. NiBX-Coating applied by manufacturer. The GLOCK 19 is ideal for a more versatile role because of its reduced dimensions when compared to the standard sized option. Chambered in 9x19, it has found worldwide acclaim with both private and public security agencies. In addition to being used as a conventional service pistol, it is ideal for concealed carry or as a backup weapon.


About the Technology
Why put Nickel Boron (NiB-X) on my Firearm?
NiB-X offers a unique combination of wear resistance and a low coefficient of friction (superb lubricity).  There are harder surface treatments available (but they have no lubricity) and there are more lubricious coatings (teflon scratches off) but there are no coatings that optimize this combination of performance attributes like NiB-X.  

Will the process affect my parts?
The NiB-X process does not affect the part through excessive temperatures like some other technologies you may consider.  And there is no hydrogen embrittlement of the part due to the process.  The maximum process temperature is 195F with an optional post coating precipitation bake to further harden the coating performed at 450F.  All temperatures are low enough as to not be detrimental to your parts.

What are the differences between NiB-X and other technologies such as Nickel Teflon, Chrome, Melonite (tennifer, black nitride), PVD (IonBond), Nickel boron nitride, and CeraKote (and other spray on bake on treatments such as DuraCoat, GunKote, etc).
NiB-X is harder than chrome and has a Rc70 hardness.  This is much harder than Nickel Teflon (~Rc45), and MeloniteTM  (Rc55).  The process temperature for Melonite and other salt bath nitrocarburizing is 1050F and too high for many components.  PVD coatings are harder than NiB-X but are only a couple microns thick and do not have the low coefficient of friction.  NIB-X provides higher reliability operation for longer durations and allows for reduced maintenance and easier clean up.  Nickel Boron nitride is essentially electroless nickel with boron nitride mixed in the matrix, very similar to the Nickel Teflon process.  Whereas NiB-X is a single coating and structure throughout the thickness, Nickel Teflon and Nickel Boron Nitride are duplex layers with a layer of electroless nickel and then a thin layer of EN+Teflon or EN+ Boron Nitride (.0001”-.0002”).  Once the telfon or boron nitride wears off you are down to only electroless nickel.

I bought this scope brand new from Opticsplanet. I am the original owner. I have all product documentation, however I can't locate warranty card and am not sure if I sent it in. I used this ACOG very few times since I've owned it. Therefore, It sat unused for long periods of time. When I did take it out I was careful not to mar the finish. It's virtually blemish free. I can't sell it new because it's used, but you'd swear it was never handled. There are no scratches on the lenses and no scratches on the main tube.  It comes with Scopecoat and original soft carry case with Lenspen. I'll send the original TA-51 base that the ACOG was attached to as well. This ACOG is in near perfect condition. The photos show exacty what will come with the scope. This ACOG will be sold ""AS Is"". I am selling this really nice ACOG to fund the purcahse of a Nightforce scope of a different model. I'd keep this if I could afford to.

The lower is a CMMG MOD4 SA (single action trigger) marked Cal. 223-5.56 Serial # SA228xx

The upper is a Del-Ton mid length upper with 16 inch 1:7 twist chrome lined barrel and bolt carrier group. It's had 110 flawless rounds through it. No ftf's or fte's. It is a flat top, I have a dual aperature rear sight to go with it, a FM 3-9x26 scope (scope was $40 when I got it on deal), and 600+ rounds of assorted ammo. There are 3 Magpul P-Mags (two still in the packaging), and 9 mil-spec steel magazines. I have not had the time to sight the scope in...so that'll be up to you to do. There are two handling marks on the left side of the barrel...a two nicks at the front of the flat top that were present when I received the new upper receiver. I have additional pictures to show what I have detailed. No rust to be found any place on it (though the bolt carrier group could use a quick cleaning). 

The only trades I would consider are a Kahr CM9 or PM9, Springfield XDm 9 compact, S&W M&P compact in 9mm, or a S&W Shield in 9mm....with a good iwb holster and an amount of cash to be determined upon discussion. Would prefer the firearm to have either contrast color night sights, or XS big or standard dot sights....but that is not a deal breaker by any means. 

I'm asking $825 cash for the whole package. Trade value will be $870 (I've invested a decent amount of cash between the extra mags and ammo). All laws apply (valid FOID card, minimum 24 hours waiting period - 72 hours if trading a handgun, record of transfer, etc.) Which ever of the firearms sells first, I am pulling the other. So if the Bersa Thunder 9 UC Pro sells first, I am pulling this ad, and vice versa.


Ammo count is as follows:

5 boxes of Winchester white box 223 Rem. 55 grain full metal jacket - 40 round value packs (200 rounds total)

2 boxes Winchester Super X 223 Rem. 55 grain pointed soft points - 20 rounds per box (40 rounds total)

4 boxes of PMC Bronze 223 Rem. 55 grain full metal jacket - 20 rounds per box (80 rounds total)

676,http://www.armslist.com/posts/580676,For Sale/Trade:  Hatsan 125 Sniper NPSS Air Rifle,"Littleton CO, Denver, Colorado",$ 260,"Listed On: Tuesday, September 25, 2012",Rifles,no type,no type,Break Open                                                                                ,Rifle,"Selling my Hatsan 125 Sniper Air Rifle in .22 caliber
This is a great gun and a lot of fun to shoot. I hate to give it up but i need the money.
Breakbarrel Nitro-Piston makes this gun quiet and gives it the ability to stay cocked for a long time without spring fatigue
Up to 1250fps. Can generate about 25ft/lbs. Powerful enough to take out vermin and small game yet accurate enough to hit 2"" 5-shot groups at 50 yards (with proper technique and practice).
Mossy Oak stock with adjustable Tru Glo fiberoptic sights.
Comes with attached dovetail AND weaver rails
Will include the bipod that came with the gun, although i don't suggest using it given that break-barrel air rifles work best using the ""artillery hold"" (look it up)
Also included is a 3-9x40 scope, weaver scope mounts and a shoulder sling. 
The rifle is in great condition although it has a few small scratches on the stock
For more information on the gun visit:
http://www.pyramydair.com/s/m/Hatsan_125_Sniper_Air_Rifle_Combo_NPSS_Camo/2783
To watch a review on this rifle go to:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmsKDtCj2rk
This rifle prefers Beeman Kodiak, H&N Barracuda Match, and JSB Diabolo Jumbo/Jumbo Heavy pellets
With a powerful air rifle like this you want to choose heavy pellets or accuracy will suffer as velocity rises above the speed of sound
The gun and mounts cost about $415 (gun = 400, scope = 15-20). Asking $260. But make me an offer. If it's fair i will accept.
Will trade for mosin nagant rifle (any model. 91/30 only with matching serial numbers), lee enfield rifle, mauser, SKS, any other WWI to WWII period rifles, other Eastern Block rifles or a tactical .22.
Willing to add cash (About $150) if I like the trade.

It is a very early model with the first 3 letters of the serial number being AAL. It is no dash and no ""M"" mark that states it has been re-worked. I have shot .357 mags with no lock up issues at all, this gun is very accurate and has tight groups. Great for a collector or perfect for the range. The previous owner claims there was trigger work done, the screws look to have been removed and it is extremely light in SA and very surprisingly light in DA. The blue is in good condition with some issues here and there as any pistol of this age would have. It has the adjustable rear sight and unfortunately I did not get it with the original wooden grips but it has nice comfortable rubber ones. I have the gun, a case, and a HKS speed loader to go with it. Not really looking for trades but if it sparks my interest and is at least equal value I'll listen to offers. Asking 600 FIRM."

I have a Glock 17(9mm) that shoots amazingly! Barrel looks pretty great with little wear. I made sure this thing performed beautifully and have put only the best upgrades into it. I have an extended mag release on it, an extended slide release, some older Trijicon night sites(much better than the breakable stock sites IMHO), and a 3.5 lbs competition trigger job on it(I believe it is Ghost components). All of the internals were replaced by Glock about a year ago when I first bought it. Comes with 2 new ambidextrous 17 rd mags and a Glock box. It doesnt get much better than this! Priced to move by lunch tomorrow!

Tailored to the needs of combat and tactical medical personnel, QuikClot® Combat Gauze™ combines surgical gauze with a proprietary inorganic material that stops arterial and venous bleeding in seconds – even more rapidly in this format than earlier Z-Medica products. Based on a different mineral than zeolite-based QuikClot® products, it generates no heat. It shares the benefit of being inert and non-allergenic. 

Combat Gauze provides the ease of gauze but with an added clotting agent embedded within providing the power to stop even the worst arterial and venous bleeding. The user simply packs the Combat Gauze dressing into the wound just as they have been taught in any basic first aid class over the years, and applies pressure for 3-5 minutes. Even the most traumatic arterial and venous bleeding is stopped. QuikClot Combat Gauze is so pliable that it conforms to virtually any size or shape of injury you will encounter. It is easily removed once clotting has taken place.

I can meet buyer at Eastgate for transaction.

The Starr revolver is an early development of the double action mechanism, it was a complicated but advanced design of the period, and generally made before the Civil War. It has two triggers which function as follows. Depress the forward trigger slightly and the rear trigger will become active, further depress the main trigger and the hammer will cock and hold in conventional single action manner. At this point the forward trigger is disengaged entirely, and single action firing is effected by depressing the rear trigger, or the cock can be slowly released by depressing the rear trigger and controlling the hammer back into resting position. Alternately the forward trigger can simply be operated from resting position without cocking, it will fire the round and advance the cylinder in one motion, hence the ""double action"". The revolvers are fitted with a single wood grip, another departure from the two grip convention of the period. Manufactured by Starr Arms Co , New York, NY. Frame is marked on right side, ""STARR ARMS. CO. NEW. YORK."", and left side, ""STARRS PATENT JAN 15, 1856."" Serial number is marked on cylinder, and is visible on the frame with the hammer cocked. . Round barrel length 6in. VERY EARLY PRODUCTION #264 matching"

I will consider partial trades but would need at least 2/3+ cash.  Additionally, checked for these at last Saxet show and saw none.

I'd rate the condition at a 6.5/7 out of a 10, don't forget it is used and over a 100 years old, it is 98% complete, it is missing the butt peice on the end on the stock, could be replaced with a modern plactic/rubber cap style butt end thou easily with 2 screws. I think my price of $750 is pretty realistic, the few I found for sale were in the $775-1300 price range. 

The Batavia Leader number series were from 75,000 to about 106,000 and production was basically from 1897-1915 and only 31,000 units made between these dates, the series stamped on it starts with a 84,xxx so I'd say it's a early 1900's piece.

It is is very good condition. It has been taken out and fired once. Maybe 25 rounds of target shot and five rounds of buckshot through it.

I purchased this new from a local sporting goods store last year. I'm not sure if I have the original papers anymore (not much there except a couple brochures), but I do have the receipt to prove I am the original owner.

In addition to the shotgun, I'll include the soft case, which is nice and compact (fits the weapon nicely), the factory lock and keys, and twenty rounds of ammo. Ten Royal Buck #4's (21 pellet), ten Remington 7/8oz high velocity slugs.

I've compared this to multiple Mossberg 500's and can't find any difference besides the position of the safety. Unlike the earlier Mavericks, this one has the twin extractors and dual slides, same as the 500. Brass bead front sight.

The stock is the original; however, it has been shortened a little bit. Despite being over 6' tall with long arms, I just did not find the stock LOP comfortable.

It now has about 13"", which is about an inch longer than the popular stocks advertised as either 'youth' or 'body armor.' The added shell carrier is tucked underneath the buttpad, firmly fixing it in place and keeping the shells out of the way of my right hand and cheek while in firing position. The light weight of the gun coupled with its compactness really makes it a great 'go-to' home defense shotgun.

Asking $250 OBO."
