Seekins Precision Lower The SP 223 Billet lower feature a unique design geared towards the serious tactical shooter. The oversized winter trigger guard, quick access mag release, beveled mag well, ambi bolt drop and user friendly features make this lower the best on the market. Ambidextrous bolt control allows the shooter to quickly drop the bolt or from either side of the firearm. 

       Details: •Perfectly CNC Machined from 7075 T6 Billet

            •Gen 2 configuration

AR-Restor Recoil Buffer: Tames felt recoil & suppresses bolt bounce for maximum reliability, accuracy & service life.

AR-15 CS Buffer Spring: Made of chrome silicon alloy; which offers significant, advanced operational enhancements for the shooter who is serious about firearm performance.

VLTOR Mil-Spec Receiver Extension: Receiver extension tube has the correct, 1.146"" outside diameter for mounting collapsible buttstocks designed for the smaller, mil-spec tube. Allows fast, easy repeatability of buttstock position with five notches on underside to accept the stock’s locking pin and corresponding white position numbers on top visible through the witness hole on many stocks. Precision machined from aluminum bar stock for consistent dimensions that ensure smooth, snag-free sliding of buttstock.

TAPCO Sling Adapter: •Mil-spec black phosphate finish •Made in USA •One piece stamped steel construction reduces potential for breakage •No bind ambidextrous sling attachment allows for 180 degrees of movement •No need to reattach sling to opposite side of the rifle when transitioning to offhand shooting

Carbon Fiber Free Floating Rail System Tubular free-float forearm is made of lightweight, high-strength carbon fiber to reduce heat transfer to the shooter’s hand during sustained fire and provide excellent handling characteristics. Precision-made, aluminum barrel nut rigidly clamps the forearm to the upper receiver. Generous porting on some models enhances heat transfer while reducing weight even more.

KNS Precision Non-Rotating Pin Set: Redesigned hammer pin and anti-rotation links provide the strongest possible system to eliminate pin rotation. Helps prevent wear to receiver holes, which is especially important for increasingly-valuable M16 and pre-ban receivers. Notched hammer pin locks into slots in the anti-rotation links; trigger is secured with locking screws, and includes lube ports so adequate lubrication reaches the trigger. Anti-rotation links fit on the outside of the receiver to prevent all movement.

Battle Comp 2.0: Multi-purpose compensator reduces muzzle climb, so you stay on target between shots during rapid fire engagements. Reduces flash signature and produces less concussion than the standard A2 flash hider for a smaller dust signature when shooting prone.

It ejects the shells to the side, and does not jam, so they have worked out all the bugs in their 1911.  A 1911 in size and design, but the ONLY 1911 in a 357 caliber.  A great gun to own and to shoot.  I have put about 500 rounds through the gun, and it has been great.  You can shoot 38, 38+P, or 357 calibers, but need to change out the spring between the 38 and 357 calibers.  This is very easy to do in the field or at the range.  I have the original carrying case, both springs (one for 38 and another for 357), and two extra clips plus the one that came with the gun.  The gun is designed forsingle hand use, so locks and safety can be adjusted with your thumb as you hold the gun.  Whenever I pull this gun out at the rane, evryone stops by to see it, and with a 357, they know you are shooting a magnum caliber.

219,http://www.armslist.com/posts/723219,For Sale/Trade:  New Unused Custom Multicam Ghillie Suit!,"South Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 400,"Listed On: Saturday, December 22, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is my Ghillie Suit I made AFTER Sniper School in 2010 for my 2011-2012 Afghanistan Deployment. I took this ghillie suit to Afghanistan and back(minus the hat, used my original hat from sniper), but I was in an SDM role instead of a Sniper role and I did not use it. I am in need of money for a firearm project thus I am selling. It took me over three months to make and I have receipts showing a total investment of over $1,000(I must keep for tax purposes). The ghillie hat was finished this year. The hat and netting were new and professionally sewn on by a local seamstress. It took me 8 hours to put the Jute on the boonie cap.

My total price is less than the price of the materials and seamstress labor alone! Making these is monotonous and time consuming! This is not a cookie cutter ghillie suit that is mass produced; this suit is intended and designed for combat operations. You will not find another one of this quality and in this condition for this price that is made by a US Army Sniper trained soldier; or one that has gone to Afghanistan and back and still in new condition... I worked out all the kinks from my actual Sniper School ghillie suit (pictured). The only thing I did not get around to is cutting air vents into it the hat, jacket and pants before I put the jute on; these things get hot in the summer. . .

This multicam Ghillie suit is NEW! (HAS NOT BEEN THROUGH GHILLIE WASH YET!) It was made from Propper brand jacket and pants! It's way more durable than the issued multicam uniforms. The canvas and netting were professionally sewn (have receipts). All seems have been Shoe-Goo'd and painted! Elbow and knee pads have been installed in the perfect position for sniper crawl. There are a bunch of tan 550 cord tie downs.

Package includes:

Multicam Ghillie Hat - Size: 7 1/4
Multicam Ghillie Jacket - Size: Medium Regular
Multicam Ghillie Trousers - Size: Small Regular Pants fits up to 31"" waist.
Comes with used Heavy Duty Dickies suspenders
Black sleeping bag stuff sack that fits all (has a blown seam, but still holds suit fine.)

Note: I took the the field pictures of this ghillie suit last week on Fort Carson. This suit works nearly year round in this area and in Afghanistan. I had just taken the suit out of the stuff sack, it is not normally wrinkled and stiff looking. I highly recommend that you put this suit through a ghillie wash, and remember 70% of your suit in the field should be natural veg! The last picture is myself in 2010 in a ghillie suit of the same design but built from DCUs.

$400 cash or best offer, I am in no rush to sell. I am available weekends and weekdays. I can send larger pictures, production pictures, and will meet for inspections. Please call Nate at REDACTED if you're interested. This item is on ebay for $450+Shipping with many watchers! So please serious inquiries only and no low ball offers."

Even though I'm not a lever action guy, I kept it with the intent to restore it. For a variety of reasons (the biggest of which is that I'm just not a lever action fan) I never got around to doing anything to it. I did find a replacement top-eject .30-30 barrel for it; there's nothing wrong with the original barrel on it, other than it's in .32 Special (not a problem in itself, but again I'm not a lever action fan; sorry, all my childhood heroes used the M-1 Garand or bolt actions). This would be a great project gun for anyone who is into these old west/cowboy types of weapons. 







The serial number indicates that it was built in 1941. It is mechanically sound (verified by a local gunsmith) although it has a lot of finish wear on the receiver (I understand that this was pretty common with the Winnie 94's). The wood is a little worn in some spots, but seems to be pretty good overall; there are no cracks or splits in it that I can see. There is considerably less bluing worn off the barrel. 

What can I say, it's a 71 year old gun. It's older and it was used, but it was also taken care of. 

I'm assigning a trade value of $600 to this. I'm not trying to overestimate it's worth, but they also don't make these anymore.

Trade interests: 

-S&W model 15 with a 4"" heavy barrel .38 Special.

-SKS

-What else do you have? Try me, the worst I'll say is ""No thanks"".

This trade will be FTF in NC for now. It's the holidays, and with all the lunacy currently going on, I ain't even gonna think about shipping....

I have had some action work done only to help aid in cylcing rounds, had a new spring put in in box for shells, & had a little trigger work performed - now @ 3.5 lbs. I also had a bullet cast done to positively know bullet diameter -it came out as .311"" bore. It looks good even with signs of wear. The scope mounts are original BSA over-under mounts. The gun is dated at 1951 and is based on the P14 action. The stock is the original lighter E model stock.The scope is an older Tasco world class 3x9x40. This version seems to be a hard to find -I have found them in a lot of calibers(30-06,243,270), but very few in 303. Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems on the RARE side.

I have available for sale a Romanian G parts kit AKM build assembled on a Nodak Spud NDS-1 receiver. This was made from a kit which was actually what they used in the military and not a cheap WASR where they used scrap parts from the bin.

The rifle was assembled from an un-issued Romanian G parts kit and is all numbers matching except for the rear trunnion. The front trunnion, bolt carrier, bolt, and recoil spring are all numbers matching. The receiver cover is not numbered. As you can see the rifle has a side-mounted scope rail which was sourced from Kalinka Optics (not Romanian). The furniture on this rifle is in Ironwood designs US-made laminate set finished in the classic iodine color. 

The US parts on this rifle consist of a Tapco trigger group (3 parts), plus Ironwood Designs furniture (3), and US-made receiver totaling 7 US made parts – so you can use any surplus magazine with it. 

I have fired approximately 700 rounds fired through this gun (all new Russian ammunition noncorrosive) found that the rifle does in fact function without issue. 


Romanian G parts kit without barrel - $450
Romanian barrel – $100 
Tapco Single Hook trigger group – $25 
Ironwood designs AKM furniture – $155 
Romanian Bayonet - $30

As you can see the total cost for all the parts not including the receiver is about $760 not including labor for the work to put the gun together.

The following is information online.
One area where the Steyr pistol might have a leg up on all competitors is its sights. The low-profile sighting system combines a triangular front sight with a trapezoidal rear notch, drawing your eyes to the front sight and making fast aiming a cinch. It took no time at all to learn this innovative sight combination. What’s more, the sights’ low profile is further enhanced by the M40-A1’s low-profile slide upon which they are mounted, making the pistol ideal for concealed carry. The geometry also results in a low bore-axis, making the gun point very naturally.
Apart from its Austrian parent, the M-series has also been compared to the Glock primarily because of its trigger-paddle safety, which prevents enough rearward movement to make it nearly impossible to fire without intentionally pulling the trigger. It’s true—both the M-series and Glock pistols share this feature."

This is an 8 shot 22lr and it weighs 11oz.  I've got the box and papers.  I've changed the rebound spring (trigger spring) to a 14# and the hammer spring to a 9#.  Not only does it make the trigger SA & DA lighter but it makes it much smoother than the S&W trigger.  I have the S&W springs and I can put them back in with the help of Arnold Schwarzenegger if you so desired.  I have a set of Barami grips on it.  These are the kind with the lip that you can tuck in your waistband without a holster.  The original grips are in the box.  I've put about 900 rounds through it.  I bought one for my wife and liked it so much that I bought one for myself.  The weapon is so light even when loaded that you forget it’s there.   I belong to a club in Efland so if you wanted to try it out you’d be welcome to.   I do have an NCDL and CCW.  Oh yeah, price is $490 and I'll through in a 325 round box of Federal.  I've been pretty wishy-washy about selling this because of the political situation.  However, now there's something I want.

The dimensions from the internet are as follows:
 Perfect for concealed carry, personal protection security & law enforcement roles. Reversible magazine release. Ambidextrous decocking/manual safety levers. External hammer. 4"" hammer-forged SS barrel, SS slide, full length guide rod, 3-dot sights. Ergonomic, checkered polymer frame with interchangeable backstraps & integrated accessory rail. DA/SA. High-capacity & light recoil. 
Trigger Pull: SA is rated at 3.96 to 5.06 pounds. DA is rated at 8.8 to 12.1 pounds.
Weight: 24.8 oz (according to the FN manual, but 25.2 oz according the FN USA's site, and 1lb. 14oz or 30oz according to the Browning site.) To find out, I weighed my empty FNP9 and got 25.5 oz, but my scale is not the most accurate. I think that the 25.2 oz weight is probably correct. I loaded 10 rounds w/115-gr. bullets into the magazine and got a total weight of 5 oz. I think this is where at least the major part of this discrepancy occurs. (The gun is available in the US with 10-rnd magazines in states restricting magazine capacity while the standard capacity magazine available in the rest is 16. FWIW, with 16 rounds, the total weight of the cartridges and magazine is 9 oz.)
Capacity: 16 + 1, (10 + 1 in some states) 
Length: 7.40""
Height: 5.40""
Width: 1.55""
Barrel Length: 4"" (rifled length: 3.15"")
Pitch: 1:16, right-hand (The manual says ""1:6"" but comparing it to a BarSto Hi Power bbl, the twist does appear very similar and I believe it is 1 turn in 16"" and that the manual's description is a misprint. A 1:6 twist would be very, very fast. In any event, it does not appear as fast as the 1:10 twist in the factory Hi Power bbl.)

Bottom of barrel is marked ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY."" Upper left frame is marked with the Ordnance Department final acceptance mark “GHS”, the unique initials cartouche of Gilbert H. Stewart, a Major in the Army Ordinance Department during WWI and the acting Commander of Springfield Arsenal from January 11, 1918 to March 15, 1918.  The Rampart Colt on the left side of the frame is clear and distinct.   The “H” acceptance mark from Frances L. Hosmer (a civilian inspector from 1911 through 1925) is present on the rear of the cylinder and inside the crane recess. The left grip frame is also marked with a “G” signifying “government contract.”  The crane and frame have the Colt serial number 169206, an early Model 1917 production, which ran from SN 150000 to 301000.  The butt is marked ""U.S. ARMY MODEL 1917/NO. 19329,"" which was the Army serial number for this revolver.  I do not know the significance of the “RA” stamped on the butt of the right grip.  The lanyard swivel is also present.  The barrel is still shiny with very strong rifling.  The action is crisp and the lockup is tight.

Includes everything but the 'fire control unit' and magazine. The FCR is the the internal trigger assembly that can be swapped between frames. It is the 'gun' part that bears a serial number.

Everything is in great shape. You can see slight external wear on the parts of the barrel that contact the slide, and some on the frame where the takedown lever pivots. This is just mild cosmetic stuff from the normal operation of the weapon.

If you have a P250 of any type, these parts will turn it into a full-size 9mm. You can also just use the upper parts (the grips are inexpensive) to change caliber.

These parts are from a second generation kit. The first generation P250's were the ones that were problematic; I've had no issues with my second gen P250; I just prefer the subcompact setup and have no use for these parts.

If you do not have a P250, the FCR's tend to pop up for about $200-250, but don't appear to be regularly available from Sig.

Bottom of barrel is marked ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY."" Upper left frame is marked with the Ordnance Department final acceptance mark “GHS”, the unique initials cartouche of Gilbert H.

The Rampart Colt on the left side of the frame is clear and distinct. The “H” acceptance mark from Frances L.

First is a like new G&L Tribute Series ASAT Special Deluxe Carved Top guitar with sunburst finish.  I never learned how to play and this isn’t doing me any good.  I can include a practice amp, instrument cable, gig bag, etc with the right deal.  Strongly prefer a FTF deal in IL, but would ship for the right deal.  I have lots of pictures available and can take more upon request.  Next is a Gulbransen Spinet piano from 1954. My wife got this in hopes of playing, but it’s also sitting unused.  We had this tuned recently and it’s in great shape.  The only issue is one bad key (the highest note, whatever that is) needs to be repaired.  I also have lots of pictures of this, but this would be FTF only.  My preference for trades would include handguns in .22, 9mm or .38/.357, or shotguns in 12ga (strong preference for SxS or shorter barrel lengths).  I would consider other firearms or calibers, but these are my first choice.  I’d also consider other related items.  I have other items to add to trades (non-musical) or cash if necessary.

Simply twist the self-locking selector ring on the dual-spectrum V-series head to switch between output modes. In either mode, the M620V's TIR lens produces a tight beam suited for short- to medium-range applications. The high-efficiency LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break. Comes with a momentary/constant-on pushbutton tailcap switch and a momentary-on pressure-activated tape switch with a 7"" cable that can be positioned where you choose. Also available are optional dual SR pushbutton/pressure pad switches. The M620V clamps solidly to any long gun equipped with a Picatinny rail via its integral M93 Swing-Lever™ rail clamp, which self-adjusts to off-spec rails and features a lever lock to prevent loosening from vibration or recoil. Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for durability and maximum light transmission, the M620V is O-ring sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture. Battle-proven and built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black (BK) or Desert Sand (TN) body color."

Although they got a bit of a bad rap when first released, the newer ('second generation') models such as this one seem to have all the kinks ironed out.

Personally, I think it's a great little handgun. Shoots like a full size but conceals like a sub. The DAO trigger is not for everyone, but I'm pretty fond of it for a concealed carry weapon. No active safeties to mess with, but the double-action travel means you're not going to pull this trigger on accident. 

Only a few hundred rounds through this one. Zero problems- no FTE's, misfeeds, or other issues. Trigger pull has a consistent weight and is very smooth. For me, the grip is very comfortable, even without a pinky rest, and I find it much easier to hold onto than most subcompacts.

Comes with one 12 round mag and one 15 round mag, plus the original case. This was part of the '2sum' set; I have the full size parts listed separately but would be willing to make someone a good deal on the set.

PLease don't email giving me your opinion that you think the price is to high or you can find it cheaper somewhere else. This price is more than fair.

North Lee Highway... call REDACTED
The Heckler and Koch 416 Pistol is a handgun version of the H&K 416, chambered in .22LR. This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the .22 416 rifle. Like the other .22 LR firearms offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416’s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.
The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 pistol are the same as the .22LR 416 rifles. They are made of high-strength polymer and designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version.  A blowback system operates the .22 caliber HK 416 Pistol. The dust cover functions and the bolt remains open when the magazine empties. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation and its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’."
