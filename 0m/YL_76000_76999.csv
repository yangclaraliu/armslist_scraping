This is definitely a ""well loved"" gun. I purchased this from an Estate Sale in Minnesota. The gentleman I purchased this from was going into a retirement community and had to sell off his estate. To the best of my knowledge, he had inherited this firearm from his Father. I was enchanted with stories of contests and general mayhem. There are a few ""antique"" repairs. When I say antique, I mean that it is not a modern or recently done repair. There is an added cheek comb in the stock that is plugged and ""shimmed"". The butt is a steel plate that is spaced from the end of the stock with what looks like a cut to fit piece of an inner tube to some old automobile. Its a hard rubber spacer whatever it is. In 1944 he was 16 and he was climbing a tree trying to get a better vantage when he slipped and broke the hammer on the left barrel, he has since replaced the hammer with an oddball but functional replacement. Its a truly neat gun with a nice back story. 

ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS

**This gun WILL function fine with MODERN AMMO. The barrels are stub-and-twist and will handle light modern loads. Heavier loads should be done with blackpowder shells.

MARLIN MOD 50 12 GA ""GOOSE GUN"":I rescued this gun in '06. It had been in a basement in LA and had surfaced during Hurricane Katrina. This gun needs: firing pin, trigger parts (trigger and some parts are present some are not), magazine, and mag innerds. The barrel was shortened to 30"" due to crown pitting. this gun could me made to fire again for around 100.00 or less.

Savage/Stevens 107B Single Shot 12 Ga: A purchase from an auction. this gun needs whatever funky stock was put on it removed and a new stock put on. it needs some oil as well.

Mont. Wards ""HERCULES"" 12GA: Nice old gun from the late 20's. This is a stripped gun. Around 30 years ago the previous owner lopped the original barrel down to 18 3/4 inches. This gun needs:foregrip, stock, break open spring and guide, hammer spring and guide, firing pin, trigger guard, and stock lag bolt. can be used for parts or lightly restored for wall hanging.

1911 AUTO SHOK-BUFF RECOIL SYSTEM
Mfr:WILSON COMBAT
Price:$38.99

Improves Accuracy, Functioning; Elimnates Frame Cracking From Recoil
Easy-to-install kit instantly improves cycling, reliability and accuracy without modifying the frame or the slide. Exclusive, injection-molded, polyfiber buffers slip onto the guide rod be- tween the head and spring and keep the slide from hitting the frame. Prevents expensive frame damage and softens the felt recoil of high power competition loads. Full-length guide rod keeps the recoil spring straight for smoother functioning and longer spring life. Together they provide consistent barrel lockup and increased accuracy. 

SPECS: Kit includes stainless steel full length guide rod and plug, 6 Shok-Buff washers, 1 light recoil spring, 1 heavy recoil spring, 1 extra power firing pin return spring. Fits 1911 Auto models and calibers listed only."

changed and CZ took more of a role. The blued bushing AND a black Gun case, DW Marked Slide and Barrel, all original and very rarely even racked OR HANDLED.

I did lube it last night, took it all the way down, even checked the serial under the grips, cleaned up oil that the factory had used. no pitting, no rust, it's going to need a proper break in like any well build Dan this tight.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

This gun has had only 50 round fired threw it,(there's no wear in the picture it's oil) and comes with the Sig Sauer STL-900L Weapon Light/Laser.

He purchased it on a whim about 2 years ago from our local gun store. Some guy bought it brand new, never fired it, and put it on consignment. Dad bought it, put it in the safe and it's been there every since. No scope ever mounted and never fired. 

I don't know if you have had any experience with a Les Baer AR rifle, but I can confidently say it's a work of art. The bolt slides back as if it's on roller bearings. The lock up between the upper and lower feels as though it is welded shut. And the two stage Jewel trigger breaks like glass. 2lb glass. I've never felt an AR quite like this. 

The only reason he is selling it is to fund his new Wilson Combat 6.8SPC AR he has ordered. [b]So there will be no trades on this rifle, only cash.[/b]

- Scandium Alloy Frame (N-size)
- Titanium Cylinder
- Stainless Steel (SS) barrel shroud (hybrid barrel)

Includes all original paperwork and accessories, including registration card (you can be the 'first owner' in S&W's view), 2 hammer lock keys, and even the unopened, signed fired test casing.
This gun looks like new. I know it's been shot, but I swear it couldn't have been much. There's barely even any drag marks on the cylinder.
I had to really search HARD to find any sort of mark or blemish. I'm saying the gun is 98-99%. It's not brand new, but it sure looks it!
Look at the photos for everything that comes with it. *Sorry, ammo in photos not included (can't ship it)*

In case it's not clear from the pictures, the following comes with the gun:
- 3 sets of grips: Original smooth wood Cocobolo grips, custom hand-carved finger groove wood Cocobolo combat grips (about $50 value), and Hogue rubber Monogrip grips (about $20 value).
The ones on the gun in the pictures are the custom wood grips. They are the prettiest in my option, but the Hogues are the most 'grippy' and would be best for range time. They swap out in minutes, so you can choose the best ones for your needs at that time.
- (10) full moon clips for fast reloads
- (7) 1/3 moon clips (aka deuce clips, holds 2 rounds each)
- de-mooning tool (ever tried to unload spent casings from a moon clip by hand?)
- Wolff Precision Springs:
  (1) Power Rib Shooter's Pak - Type 2, Reduced Power (Wolff stock number 17121), Includes several reduced power springs and the Power Rib reduced power Mainspring
 (1) Wolff Rebound Spring, Reduced Power, 12lb (Wolff stock number 16661)
 (1) Wolff Rebound Spring, Reduced Power, 11lb (Wolff stock number 16666)
 (1) Wolff Cylinder Stop Spring, Extra Power (Wolff stock number 17185)
 (1) Wolff Cylinder Stop Spring, Factory Standard (Wolff stock number 17180)
All the spring bags appear to be unopened, but I was told the gun had some of the springs installed, so I honestly have no idea what springs are in the gun right now. All I know is that this thing has one of the crispest non-custom triggers I've had the pleasure of pulling.
I don't have a trigger scale, but I'm estimating it at about 2.5 lbs. I'm basing this on the fact that it takes a little more than the weight of the empty gun (24oz) to trip the hammer. Of course, this applies to the feel of the tripper in single-action operation. The double-action operation is much heavier, but still pretty smooth. I'll weigh it on a proper trigger scale and update this description. 

If you look around, you'll find a few other 325 PD's for sale on other sites, but I've not found ANY of the 4"" barrel versions, nor have I ever seen another one with the GREEN Hi-Viz front sight. All the other ones have the red/orange sight. I can't say if one's better than the other, I just know this is a fairly rare gun to find for sale, if you're a collector.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

This gun has had only 50 round fired threw it,(there's no wear in the picture it's oil) and comes with the Sig Sauer STL-900L Weapon Light/Laser.

DSArms Type 1 STAINLESS Steel receiver, DSArms stainless tactical front end (short gas system), DSArms rail interface, ARMS #4 para receiver cover/mount, FSE folding charging handle. FWRA premium Imbel para lower. Knights Armament forward grip. The stainless parts were done by Rich in his Black Stainless before doing his artwork. Awesome Duracoat finish applied to all parts of rifle in his rendition of Multicam. 2 mags done to match. Lets do the math - $400 for stainless receiver (it was more), $600 for stainless tactical front end, $400 for premium Imbel para lower, $235 for rail interface, $125 for ARMS#4, $50 for folding ch, comes to $1900 for the parts alone. That doesn't include the misc small receiver parts, etc. OR Rich's cost to BUILD and re-finish in his Cen-Pat digital DuraCoat. That was over $700. Fired maybe 40 rds and functioned perfectly. I'll sell the package for $2200 from my FFL dealer in TN. If purchased in TN there is no tax as it is for sale on consignment in his store. Shipping and insurance not included.

This is the 2nd smallest .45 Glock makes.  It has a 10+1 capacity with the standard magzines.  Inlcuded with this firearm is a Glock hard case, cleaning brush, speed loader, two factory 10 rd magazines, one Glock 10 rd magazine, three total, all original paperwork included when purchased new and the test fired spent shell casing.  I have put very close to 400 rds through this gun.  It is mint.  Price is not negotiable.  This price should save you around 100 bucks vs. buying new.  This gun will not dissappoint.  I carried this weapon as a back up duty weapon to match my Glock 21 so mags would interchange.  Its now a nightstand gun.  Only reason for selling is I have new toys I want to buy.  Any questions?  Just ask!"

I bought these pistons about 5+ years ago from Jegs but decided to build a 388 stroker instead and have been sitting in the closet ever since.

This pistol has trijicon night sights (they are very bright) I have been using this as my bed side table gun since I bought it. It is the decock model and It shoots like every beretta ive ever shot... Flawless. But I am ready to sell it. I already own a 40 cal and dont really need this one. I have 2 mags: 1 factory and 1 mec-gar. It does show a little sign of holster wear but doesn't affect the performance.  I can send more pictures upon request. Thanks mike   816-786-two895

Prefer a Saiga, Browning, Benelli or Winchester, but I'll take pretty much anything right now, it's going to be used as a backup gun only as I wont be doing any real shooting other than waterfowl in Argentina.
I'm gearing up for a hunting trip to Arizona, Texas, Argentina and Chile with my wife, best friend and his wife in February.

The metal is excellent and the wood is very nice. This AK has grenade launching capability and grenade launching sight as shown in the pictures.

The rifle shoots the popular 7.62x39 caliber. It is very accurate, features a threaded muzzle with a slant brake installed Two mil-surp metal 30 round mag's and Green canvas sling,bayonet lug,bayonet and scabbard (number matching) and heavy duty bipod with 200 rounds of Ammo,upgraded Black fore end with UltiMAK M9 optic mount ( Wood Fore end Included ).Barrel: 16 1/4"", Overall: 34 1/4"".

The rifle is a combination of original Yugoslavian rifle parts and U.S.-made compliance parts. The fit and finish of the rifle is more than acceptable, with an evenly applied Parkerized finish and an above-average-condition wood fore-end.

The M70B1 has some novel features that set it apart from the run-of-the-mill AK variant. First, it has the enlarged and reinforced area around the trunnion like the RPK on its stamped receiver. In addition, a unique grenade ladder sight located on the gas block, when rotated into its upward open position, provides meter range marks and cuts off the gas port in the gas block. Also, the rifle features front and rear flip-up night sights, although the luminous material has long since disappeared. Has a smooth and comfortable trigger.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.
