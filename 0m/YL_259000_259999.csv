Knives
Native Americans often made knives out of stone like chert and flint by using a ""chipped-stone"" technique, according to Missouri State University. The worker struck the chert or flint with another stone, causing chips to fly off. Over time, the knife's edge sharpened. Workers used the same technique to make arrowheads, which were small, pointy knives that the worker attached to a shaft to make an arrow."

Only 1 Left In Stock!
The Saiga-12 self-loading smooth bored shotgun is intended for professional and sport hunting of small-and medium-size game under any climatic conditions.
This shotgun is built on the famous AK-47 action that has been proven by years of very reliable combat action!
The shotgun is used to deliver single shots. It is reloaded automatically due to the energy of powder combustion gases bled from the barrel bore through the barrel port. The shotgun may be equipped with a sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation, which makes zeroing and firing at moving targets more convenient. The gas motive unit is adjustable to match the parameters of internal ballistics inherent to the standard cartridges and ""Magnum"" cartridges, as well. For the purpose of diversifying operational capabilities the shotgun may be equipped with muzzle adapters of different chokes, including the muzzle adapter ""Paradox"". (IZHMASH)

I've shot about a box and a half of shells thru it and it never had a jam or misfire but the hammer will sometimes follow the slide, since it's double action it won't slow you down much, it's worse with factory ammo than with some reloads I got with the gun, it has not fired out of battery. I've read it is a common problem and chances are a new recoil spring and hammer strut spring will probably fix it but I haven't bought them yet to try. The finish is thin and has a nice patina. I do have what is probably the original Walther mag for it also. While the price is negotiable, I won't take $100.00 for it, so mplivers and the rest of you don't need to ask. I will trade depending on item offered but if your not serious about trading don't bother asking. Missouri residents only please. Thanks."

Then I purchased the 357 sig barrel conversion for it. It is a drop in barrel so you can shoot this gun in both calibers by simply changing the barrels.  It cycles flawllessly, Sig installed and tested the barrel for me in their custom shop because they accidentally sent me the wrong barrel the first time I ordered it.  

Model # is E2022-40-BSS

It comes with 3 mags that all accept 40 and 357 sig ammo, an extra backstrap, siglite night sights, case, lock, user manual etc. I put less than 150 rounds down the pipe on this gun and cleaned it immediately after firing it. The gun is extremely clean and it's accuracy will surprise you.

I have $800 invested with the extra mags and barrel, sig only gives 1 mag with the 2022.

Gun was $489

357 Barrel was $180

Extra mags were $80

With tax it was over $800, sad but true

LOWBALL TRADES AND OFFERS WILL BE IGNORED

This gun shoots very well in either single action or double action.  I would bet a box of ammo that it is just as accurate as a p226 or p229. This gun is a tack driver and it also has a decocker.

The gun was made by Stevens (same as a Stevens model 520), but it has Sears Roebuck on it.  These guns have an approximate value of $250 to $500 depending on condition.  I know you can buy parts for the stevens 520 that would fit this gun on various websites.  It is rare that Sears put their name on this gun.

I have a bit of a collection of Mosin Nagants and this one is of little collector value but is in great shape as a shooter. The blueing is basically 100% and its got good strong rifling. It is all matching except for the floor plate which has a serial number crossed out and a matching one engraved next to it. I cant read the date on it because it was not deeply engraved enough, but im pretty sure it is a war time production around 1943. Like I said, its not one of collector value but would be a great shooter. I have enough shooters around and want to get some extra money to go and buy another for the collection :). 

If you dont know about Mosin Nagant Rifles, they are extremely rugged rifles used by the Russian military from the late part of the 19th century until they were phased out by the SKS and AK in the mid 20th century. They were still used by other communist countries until much more recently. They fire the 7.62x54R round which is one of the least expensive and most easily obtainable military surplus rounds available. This is a great ""end of the world"" type gun to squiral away in the closet with a box of ammo because it is low in cost and always reliable. Anyhow. Let me know if your interested."

I bought this from a guy cheap because it wouldn't cycle.  I took a gamble and found out he had just put the gas tube in upside down!  Bought a brand new one and now it works like a champ.  Also the OD green paint job is his.  When I took the old gas tube out I had to slide the front sight forward and scuffed some green paint off, just needs touched up with gun paint or engine paint, something that a hot barrel wouldn't hurt.

This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. I have much more invested in this weapon than my asking price."

I would like to get either a Glock 23 generation 3 or newer(the earth brown would be amazing), a Sig Sauer 226, not a DAK model, and preferably in 40 S&W, will consider a 9mm, or a higher end full size 1911.  I am ONLY interested in Semi-automatic handguns, and only higher quality brands. Like for the right deal I may consider something like an HK.

What I have to trade is 2 Glocks and a Rock Island 1911.

I have a generation 3 Glock 27 with 3 magazines, one regular, one with finger grip extension and one glock 22 magazine with an adapter to make it fit the grip of the 27 and make it longer like a full size. This gun has slight holster wear.  Comes with case and everything.

I also have a generation 3 Glock 17 with 2 seventeen round magazines.
Almost brand new, no signs of wear at all.  No case

I also have a Rock Island 1911 with some custom grips that were made by my brother in law.  1 chip mccormick magazine, and 1 no name terrible magazine.

If I don't hear back from a fella soon, I will also go ahead and have a Kel-tec PMR 30 for trade.

Any combination and I can add or subtract cash to make the right deal.
Tell me what you have and what you consider it worth.  Make me an offer I can't refuse.

**Apparently the word trade is slightly confusing to some folks.  There is no buying outright. Cash has no value to me.  If you really want to know a cash price on a Glock its price is 500 just like a new one at loftis, because I will have to go buy a new one to get the 23 I want.  I shouldn't have to take a hit in value then go fork out more money to buy a gun that is the same value as my last one....that wouldn't make sense"

The rifle has only had about a box and a half thru it.  Shoots really nice, and accurate.  Recoil isn't as bad as you'd think.  I picked it up in the hopes of hunting elk. That probably isn't going to happen, so thought I'd see what else is out there..

I am selling one of 300 put together by Ken Elmore of SAW for SOCOM. Less than 150 of these special units were offered to the general public for sale. Certificate of Authenticity with serial number included signed by Ken Elmore. Colt & SAW considers this to be a collectible item due to the low number of units, but these are tack drivers as well. This can be used by the more discretionary person wanting something with an edge over the others, or collected for its rarity.

This particular 6920HB is lightly used with only 238 documented rounds down the tube. Unfortunately the box was misplaced in a move.
 I'm more of a ""shooter"" than ""collector"" so it would be a shame to ding her up. I also have a KAC RIS, KAC rear swivel mount, and KAC forend rail mount w/push-button sling swivel that I will sell with the rifle or separate (the rifle has to sell first). I have a FG Mil-Spec Magpul ACS (LNIB) and BLK MIAD grip kit that I will sell w/ the rifle or separate.

Recently, two of these models sold for $2,200 and $2,500 on other sites and with the discontinuation of the regular LE6920, the value of the LE6920HB only continues to rise.

It comes with Trijicon 3 dot night sights (green) 2011 manufacture date
1 15rd mag
1 10rd mag

The slide and barrel HAVE been replaced by a glock certified armorer (who I purchased the gun from), the slide was dinged somehow and hence replaced. So obviously they will not have the same series number as the frame.

The frame has an estimated 1000 rounds, the slide and barrel where new when I purchased it and I have put 300 flawless rounds down the tube since then. 

EDIT: The front sight looks crooked in the picture for some reason, I can assure you that it is straight and true shooting! 

If you are on the west side of the Metro, I will happily meet at a range so the trader can give her a test drive.

The gun is in excellent condition with no scratches at all, no holster wear (never carried). 

I am looking for:
AK of some sort
Maybe an AR upper
Baretta 92f
Basically any 9mm service pistol

I've looked into and it's possible it's a factory conversion but I doubt it. As is it is UNSAFE TO FIRE but if someone were more savvy with reloading equipment you could possibly make lower powered Tokarev rounds and be able to fire the gun much cheaper than any other Nagant revolver as 7.62 Tokarev is a lot more common and a lot easier to reload for than the Nagant original rounds and .32 S&W long. You could also buy a replacement cylinder to shoot .32 ACP

As the condition goes it's one of the best I've ever seen a Nagant revolver in. It indexes perfectly, it's never failed to fire for me and everything is very tight.

Price: $1250 cash or $1400 trade value
This gun is absolutely amazing. If you are looking for the ultimate SHTF gun then this is exactly what you are looking for. This gun was custom built to my specs by Mach 1 Arsenal out of Tennessee. This gun features many upgrades and is 922 compliant. This gun has been equipped with a SGM Tactical tri rail, Razor Shark break, SGM Tactial stock, adjustable cheek rest, single point sling adapter, finger groove pistol grip, triunion, also comes with 12 round SGM Tactical magazine. I will include a 20 round MD arms drum as well for an additional $50. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it directly from Mach 1 Arsenal and put it in my safe. This is a beautiful weapon and will make someone extremely happy. This is definitely not your everyday converted Saiga. I have much more invested in this weapon than my asking price. 

DPMS Custom Target AR-15
Price: $950 cash or $1050 trade value
This rifle is the most accurate AR that I have ever shot. This is a DPMS AR-15 with an A2 stock and a 20 inch long, 1 inch diameter stainless bull barrel. This rifle has a free floating barrel and a free floating DPMS handguard, forward assist, and dust covers. The rifle also has a 6-24x44 scope that has not been sighted in. The scope has been mounted on a top rail scope mount. The rifle also has a bipod mounted. This rifle has a railed gas block and will come with two magazines as well. The stock has a few knicks and dings but nothing major. This came from shooting on a bench. The gun has been fired very little and hasn't been fired since I mounted the scope."

Hoping for a quick sale, I have a lot of stuff to offload. This is a brand new SCAR 16s in Flat Dark Earth by FN Herstal of Belgium. If you're on this page you know what it is. This is the semi-auto version of the MK16 (SCAR-Light) that SOCOM and JSOC are currently issuing. It is a 5.56 x 45 weapon. If you need more info on the weapon itself there is a pretty extensive explanation with pictures on wikipedia. Google is your friend. As far as this particular weapon goes, it has been fired 9 times, into a 25m zero target to zero iron sights. That was the day I got it a couple months ago. Since then it has been stored in a pelican case and taken out for cleaning and showing off here and there. I have been too busy to shoot it.  Will come in factory box, does not cosmetically appear that it ever left it. In the factory box is the FN factory locking device, FN factory Dark Earth 30rd magazine (never used), and paperwork. I have the original invoice for the weapon. Bundle contents:1x SCAR 16s, 24x Center Industries 30rd mags with tan anti-tilt follower (never used), 1x GripPod Systems GPS02 bipod grip (Never used), 1x Magpul AFG2 Angled Foregrip in FDE (new in box), 1x Tuff Industries 1 or 2 point CQB sling with Quick Detach in Desert Tan (new in bag), 1x Otis Improved Weapons Cleaning Kit (brand new in MOLLE pouch.)

S&W Model 2  .32 rimfire

It seems to fall between a type 3 and a type 4 according to 
( http://www.model2project.com ) my guess is a type 3 due to the size of the serial number stamp.

There is some pitting on the barrel and some lighter pitting around the cylinder and frame, the grips look great. The internals are still tight and operate very smoothly. The hammer pulls back smooth, & locks up tight, the trigger pull is crisp and has zero creep. The top hinge is 95% tight with very slight amount of looseness noted. The bottom lock is slightly loose, but has no signs of attempted repairs. The guns finish is all original with no evidence of restoration. One thing to note however, an artificial
ejector rod was inserted, but is not in any way made permanent or caused the frame to look altered. 

Also this seems to be a S&W run production, no markings have been found that would indicate it was made for any corporations of the time

I can take and email pictures. If a strong interest is noted I can also take high-res microscopic photos of the surface, and surface stamped markings
if requested.

Laminated wood stock, stainless steel fluted barrel with adjustible compensator.  Bolt action with Tasco 3x9 scope in excellent condition!!!  Comes with sling and tactical soft case.  I believe these guns were made between 1999 and 2001.  Excellent long range varmint gun.  

I recently obtained this gun on a trade.  I am not a varmint hunter, so I am offering this up for sale or trade.  I have researched this gun and know what it is worth.  If you are interested in this gun, you probbly know how rare they are too.  I would consider trading for something of equal value.  Interested in high end AK's and AR-15's.  Perhaps even a newer handgun and cash."

I love this gun but I am a 1911 guy so I am selling.  I got it this year for a carry gun but I have a new compact 1911 now so I don't need it.

Very compact and great condition.  I have put 250 rounds through it and have not had issues.  Bore is mirror bright and looks brand new.  Very little visible wear.  Shoots great.  This thing is light (18.5 oz) so recoil is a little snappy, but it is very controllable due to good stippling and great design.  You can carry it all day and not hardly feel it.  This really is the ultimate CCW gun if you like carrying a 45 but don't want to put something the size and weight of an engine block in your pants.

This pistol has the polygonal barrel so you want to make sure you shoot jacketed bullets.

Comes with 2 magazines and case.  

Look on Gunbroker, you won't find one this cheap with 2 mags and night sights, new or used, this is a great deal.

Keep your lowball offers to yourself, face to face only, cash, CCW holders preferred."
