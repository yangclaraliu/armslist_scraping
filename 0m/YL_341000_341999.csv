It is in the original box with all the paper work. I also have the 2X magnifier with it. 

The LUCID HD7 Red Dot Sight Gen II (HD7) is a quality optic that is gaining favor with many law enforcement and recreational shooters alike. Made extremely durable, reliable and packed full of well thought out user friendly features, the HD7 is always on target.

This red dot sight has a cast aluminum frame that is fully rubber armored, waterproof, shockproof tested to .458 SOCOM, and fogproof made for extreme durability. 1/2 MOA windage and elevation adjustments on external turrets have positive adjustments with a solid audible click.

The sight gives the operator the option of four different reticles: 2 MOA Dot, 2 MOA Dot with Outer Circle, Circle with Crosshairs, Crosshairs.

The HD7 is powered by a common AAA battery for the customers' convenience and an estimated 1000 hours of battery life. The battery cap is o-ring sealed against the elements. The sight powers itself down automatically after two hours of operation.

This Red Dot Sight features two modes of operation, Manual mode and Auto-Brightness mode where a light sensor will keep the reticle at the right brightness regardless of the environment you are shooting from.

The HD7 sight is designed to mount on Weaver as well as Picatinny rails, and is secured by two 13mm 6-point slotted nuts. The mounting base height of the HD7 provides for a lower 1/3rd co-witness when used in conjunction with a BUIS. The mount is an integral part of the optic frame assembly and does not allow for the adapting of quick release type mounts manufactured by other optic companies.

Has been modified with Wolff springs to reduce recoil, double action pull and mag release force.  Recoil and double action pull are the two main complaints about this gun.  A stronger recoil spring makes it much more comfortable to shoot.  a weaker hammer spring reduces the force required for the double action pull and makes it much easier to release the magazine.

every pull of the trigger.

literally eliminates all recoil keeping my eye

563,http://www.armslist.com/posts/341563,For Sale:  Eagle open bolt 45 ACP mark I carbine,"Florence, Alabama, United States","$ 2,000","Listed On: Sunday, April 15, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is an extremely rare, 100% legal open bolt carbine. The Eagle Carbine was developed and manufactured in small numbers from 1964-68. A man by the name of Bill Ordner developed the .45 ACP Eagle Carbine, patterned around the M3 Grease Gun and used genuine Thompson 1928 wood stocks in their construction. Bill owned the Eagle Gun Company, which he operated out of his house in Stratford, Connecticut. The factory where the Eagle Carbine was actually manufactured, was located in northeast Pennsylvania. Bill would travel to the factory to proof fire new stock and pick up shipments of Eagle Carbines for resale to dealers until his factory was controversially burnt down in 1968. The Eagle Mark I, followed later by the Mark II version, were the first of several open bolt carbines to be manufactured and sold in the 1960's. These were followed by the Spitfire, the Apache and the Commando Carbine which appeared in the early 1970's. All were semiauto carbines that fired either .45 ACP or 9mm pistol cartridges using surplus Thompson, M3 or Sten magazines. The Spitfire's and Apache's were later banned by the ATF and reclassified as ""machine guns"", in effect making the already rare Eagle Carbine one of the only legal versions of this type of firearm. This particular eagle is good condition, in fact the best I have seen out of the few that still exist."

It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

Long story longer:
Bought one, the door didn't latch properly.  While on phone with CS I figured out if I lift the door on it, it latches.  I already had it bolted to the wall and was not inclined to send it in to return it.  The customer service rep insisted on sending a replacement anyway.  I fixed the original by replacing the washers on the door hinges with a slightly thicker washer, problem solved.  Now I have two gun cabinets, only need one.

I am selling the new in box replacement that Sentry sent me (NOT the one considered 'defective' by the Sentry rep, this is the new replacement).  It is unopened, but the box took a moderate beating from UPS.  

Please carefully read the factory website to make sure this item has the features you require.  It is NOT fireproof or waterproof, but my needs were only for snatch and grab proof, and to keep a couple items handy in case of emergency.  If this sounds similar to your needs, I recommend this cabinet.  It does everything the website says it will.  It will hold one long gun and a pistol or two comfortably, don't think it will take much more than that.

Check the dimensions on the website to make sure your vehicle will accommodate.  Fits in a mid sized SUV fine.

Cash only, will deliver or meet at a halfway point in the metro area.  Sale is final, I assume it is in mint condition as I have not opened it."

Uses #11 caps, and nipples are 1/4x28, same as T/C.  Twist is 1:24 so it can shoot sabots and conical bullets (like powerbelts).  The bores are good and the wood is pretty nice. The barrels were a browned finish when I bought it, but had light surface rust all over, so I reblued them (just the barrels).  The leather sling is original and is stamped ""Kodiak"".

Shot it a few times just with round balls to check function (.490 rb/patch/70gr Triple 7 2F).  Would be a great deer gun, fast second shot...  Both barrels shoot minute-of-paper plate at 25 yds. Double rear leaf sight, one each for short/long range. The newer model of this gun sells from Cabela's for $1299.00.

As to accuracy, Mr. Tuohy does an excellent evaluation of the upper. He states that the upper in ""5.45 rifle equipped with the FSC 556, firing surplus Russian ammunition, I've been able to hold 3 to 5 MOA at 600 yards with iron sights. At 100 yards, it shoots about 3 MOA with either an A2, a Smith Vortex, or the TTO/FSC556.""

As a side note, he shot 4,000 rounds through his without any problem."

987,http://www.armslist.com/posts/341987,For Sale:  *Advanced* Concealed Carry Training -Beyond the Basic Class,"Wichita, Wichita, Kansas",$ 45,"Listed On: Sunday, March 25, 2012",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Cash / Check / Credit Cards Accepted

This class is an Advanced CCH Class; it is the next logical course of instruction for that that have or are considering carrying a concealed handgun.

I am a CCH Instructor (since 2007) and a full time police officer. In teaching CCH classes, I have seen the need for a more advanced curriculum that goes beyond the CCH law and teaches how to apply CCH to your life - meaning how to effectively carry a handgun (types of carry, options, choices), types of handguns available and why you would choose a particular type, how to deploy a handgun under stress and how to make that choice.

I touch on these topics in my CCH classes, but this curriculum is designed to offer much more detail and hands-on exercises to help you as a CCH holder.

It's not enough to get your license and go to the target range. To be effective in armed defense, you need to skills and knowledge to be effective without being a liability.

I have created this course based on training and experience as both an instructor and law enforcement officer.

In this 4-hour course, you will learn:

Weapon and Holster Selection
Ammunition Choices and Philosophy
The Stages of the Draw
The Importance of Trigger Control and Fundamentals
Skill Development / Training Regimen
The Adrenaline Effect
Use of Cover and Movement
Less Lethal Options
Threat Detection, Avoidance and Confrontation
Use of Force - Legal and Moral Issues
The After Effect of combative encounters

This class consists of presentations as well as hands-on exercises. I use the SIRT training pistol as well as simulated non-firing replicas as part of this training regime.

I consider this information to be a 'must have' for anyone carrying or considering carrying a handgun. The state CCH course only goes so far. This is the additional training and information that you need.

Classes forming now, with the next scheduled to be April 28, 2012.

It showed that it was going to be a great shooter, which is to be expected with a 22 caliber Shilen barrel. I have many more photos for anyone interested in seeing more. 

For those who don't know, the 223 Wylde chamber was designed as a best of both worlds chamber for competition in order to shoot .223 Remington and 5.56 NATO rounds in one chamber. It was designed with the AR15 in mind, and I have had a Wylde chamber in an AR, and I loved it. The freebore is perfect for the 80 grain sized bullets that match the 1 in 8 twist rate.

The original high gloss 26"" fluted varmint contour barrel is also available. 9 twist shot 52 and 69 grain bullets very well. About 500 rounds.
