There is a few spots where you can see early stages of rust, especially in the handle, but nothing too nasty. Its got some wear in the muzzle and by the trigger guard. I had to rescue it from its previous owner because he wasn't taking care of it properly. I had it looked at by three different reputable dealers to confirm its authenticity and its value, so I know it's worth much more but, I don't want to haggle too much with it so I believe $900 is very fair. I'm looking for something a little more practical, and I would love to hand this piece of history over to someone who will really appreciate it's legendary status.

I am pretty firm on the price and not interested in trades. I bought this gun in May of this year with the intention of making into an SBR. However, I have decided I need a new 12 gauge much more than another SBR. I am also including two Russian noncorrosive 660 rd spam cans (1320 rounds total), a brand new Red Star Arms fully adjustable double hook trigger that I never installed and two new trigger/hammer pins for the new trigger. These triggers are highly sought after and there is usually a 2-3 month wait for delivery.

Swift scopes are little known but have great clarity and Swift's no fault warranty is one of the best in the industry. Swift Optics is an American Company thats been in business since 1920's. Swift primary business is building precision medical micro scopes for the medical industry. Their Rifle Optics, binoculoars and spotting scopes are just as precision as their medical optics.  The reason I'm selling is I sold the rifle and the buyer didn't need the scope. It takes 1"" rings and has only been mounted once on an AR-6.8 SPC but never fired. I'm asking $195.00 these Premier models sell on Optics Planet & SWFA for around $235.00 plus shipping cost. Heartland Outdoors is selling this scope for $275.00.

Bushmaster M.o.e. (Magpul Original Equipment,), meaning it came from factory with this type of furniture installed. If you go to bushmaster's website this exact carbine is on there. This is a true HBAR, stamped B MP 1/9 Nato HBAR on barrel. It is a .223/5.56. It has threaded barrel with Izzy Brake. Detachable Carry handle from factory, not a cheap NC Star handle but OEM. This is a complete rifle not a pieced together Del-ton, frontier, plum crazy or Spike's. Upper has the Keyhole Cerro Forge mark, as well as the Lower has the keyhole Cerro forge mark. There is no slop in this carbine, fit is good and snug. Outstanding performance on a 16"" barrel.
When it comes to AR15, Stick to the ABC'S (Armalite, Bushmaster, and Colt) and away from all others if you care about value and resale. I almost want to laugh when I see someone sell a Spikes Tactical for 1300$, this gun retails for 1298, but no way am I expecting that.

This is an incredible pistol and serves as my EDC. It's trigger is the best striker fired pistol trigger I have ever used - with the exception of a possible tie in the Walther PPQ - and the quick sight system makes this the fastest on target gun I have ever used. Accuracy is excellent, recoil is extremely soft for fast double taps. Excellent capacity, comfort, and durability in a sub $500 package - all with a lifetime warranty!

He has some M-1 30 carbine magazines for sale. 7 are USGI issue, 3 in the wax shipping paper, 1 was peeled open to take a look. The other 3 are out of the packaging. Those are 15 round mags.

He also has 2 aftermarket 30 round mags and a double-stacked/joined mag that holds 30 in each (60 total). I didn't check the markings of the high cap mags when I took the pics, so they may be USGI, I don't know. 

Some research puts the aftermarket mags at about $12 each unless USGI, double stack at $20 and the USGI 15 round ones between $25 and $65 depending on stampings. If you've found this post, you already know that, so feel free to make a REASONABLE offer to him.  

There's also some 30 carbine ammo for sale as well (300 rounds, 6 boxes)... pretty sure he was asking $18/box (new stuff is $22-$28/box)

Fired a full mag thru it and shot flawless..  This is the RTF2 (Rough Texture Frame) model with Scalloped slide. Glock manufactured these at the end of the Generation 3 run as a special edition.  They had a Law Enforcement package in the G22RTF2 that came with >>3<< factory 15 rd mags instead of the standard 2 and factory Glock night sights..  This is one of them.  I recently saw the new FDE Glocks and am set on getting one..  This is where the trade comes in..  I am looking for a Nice condition Gen 4 Glock 17/22 FDE for even trade or a Gen 4 G20/21 FDE and I add $50 with my Gen 3 G22RTF2.  You won't be disappointed in this G22 as the slide serrations and RTF frame add extra grip and are in much demand since being discontinued.  Thanks for looking  
If you are worried about cost/worth going from Gen3-Gen4.  My G22RTF2 was $550+tx.. That was last weekend.   Same price as the Gen4 G17/22 FDE  (unless your LGS is price gouging)"

The blueing is very nice and none of the screws have been tampered with. It is drilled and tapped from the factory for a peep sight. This rifle shoots very well. The wood does have some handling marks and a couple scratches here and there but all in all it is in nice shape. Being .243 it is actually a little more rare. Most of them were produced in .308.

Ready to make a deal on something new, I don't shoot this anymore and am ready for something different.

I have a Beretta 96 frame with the 96 upper in .40 cal and the 92 upper in 9mm.  In seconds you can switch from one caliber to another!  It also has crimson trace grips, 3 magazines and a hard case that holds both mags and both uppers.  It is in good shape, fires parabellum rounds with no problem at all.  I frequently take it to the range and switch the uppers back and forth and it works with no issue at all.  The magazines either hold 15 9mm or 12 .40 rounds.  Email and I will send pics or answer any questions.  This is 2 guns in one deal, can't beat it.  Shoot me an offer or let me know what you have to trade, will consider all deals so don't be shy."

It had been sitting there in a soft case at least since the early 1970's. Our consignor did take some steel wool to the top of the receiver to polish out where the identifying marks are. We did explain to him how that hurts the overall value of this piece. The bore is dark but the rifling looks strong. It does not look to be corroded. We have not cleaned the barrel or the action. There is some surface rust. It is guaranteed to feed, fire and eject. We will offer 7 day inspection period. It is C&R eligable.

I have the original manual, but not the cleaning kit or box.

Here are the specs.

THE SAIGA 100 IS AN AUTOLOADING RIFLE with a plastic buttstock. The fore end consists of two plastic guards, receiver cover is made of the reinforced plastic, the receiver is closed with plastic housing, the buttontype safety, 3-round magazine. The Saiga-.308 ver. 102 is an autoloading rifle with a plastic buttstock and fore end. The receiver cover is made of the reinforced plastic, it is closed with a plastic housing, the button-type safety, 3-round magazine. 
The Saiga, 100 series autoloading hunting rifle features a classic hunting design. In fact the rifles of new series keep the principle of operation and design of the main mechanisms that of the Saiga rifles, the high reliability of which is corroborated by their long-term usage in various environments.

Please feel free to make an offer, but I am not desperate to sell this rifle, so lowballs will be ignored. You can email me or call/text 414-248-97fournine with any questions. Trades will be considered, but I am particular with what I am interested in. Only looking to do local FTF transactions at this time, but would be willing to travel a reasonable distance within WI. Buyer must be able to verify they are 21 years of age.

This lot of Remington model 12's were accumulated by my father for his retirement enjoyment.  The model 12 was the rifle he learned to shoot with.  Unfortunately, he passed away before he got to realize this goal.

I've decided to sell the entire collection as a lot.  I am limited to 3 pictures so I will through as much as I can into those pictures.  Detailed pictures are available upon request.

There is just no way that I can inventory every little part included, many of which are still in the sealed wrapper he bought them in.  There are more than $1,500 in parts included.

I believe there is (1) Remington Special and (1) gallery special in this lot.  The assembled rifles are fairly evenly split between ocagon and round barrels.  Not pictured are an additional 10+ barrels, many of which have reciever housings attached.

This is the ultimate lot for the Remington model 12 fan.

I have a nice working 25 mm flare pistol for sale. It's of German manufacturer, model LP42 (Leuchpistole 42), manufactured by C. u. W. Meinel-Scholer, Klingenthal, Sachsen, Germany. It has ""eun"" stamped on one side, along with a serial number of 165033. It's equipped with a lanyard ring and exposed hammer (very cool), with a trigger/hammer block safety (so it can be left loaded, but can not be accidently slam-fired by dropping on hammer). It locks up tight and shoots well. Fires 25 mm shells, still readily available. Also available are adapters (inserts) that allow it to shoot 12 g. and other pistol and rifle calibers, since the action on this flare pistol is very strong.  Also comes with a watertight storage box.
One like it can be seen at Webster Guns at http://websterguns.com/wwii-flare-gun-p-14840.html
Please ""shoot"" me an e-mail if you want to come take a look. Please remember to include your phone number, and put ""flare pistol"" in the subject.
