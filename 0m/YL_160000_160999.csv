This rifle is NOT an arsenal refurb. The only part of the rifle that has been changed is the wood on the gas tube, and the finish on it doesn't match the rest of the stock. The cleaning rod is missing, but the cleaning kit is still in the buttstock and the trap door still seals up tight. The rifling is still sharp and clean, it has been fired very little.  

The rifle shoots great, just put over 100 rounds through it a week ago. I'll include what ammo I have (around 300 rounds) and about 30 stripper clips and a Cobray 30 round detachable magazine. I've never used the magazine, so I can't say how good it works.

I really like the Glock design, but it does not fit my hand well at all. I could perform a grip reduction and install a beaver tail to avoid slide bite and improve handling, but I have found the XD9 fits my hand extremely well right out of the box. Below is a list of upgrades. I have all original parts, and invoices for upgrades. If you are not a fan of the belt clip I will remove it for you and keep it for someone that is. I bought this gun close to NIB for $450.00 and have since added another 125 dollars in upgrades and modifications. I would be willing to sell it for 550 cash but I am much more interested in trading for an XD9 subcompact NIB or close to NIB. If you have one and are willing to trade it, it would be straight across no cash from either party. It must have box and gear and be in excellent shape, but I will overlook honest holster wear and such. The only wear on the G19 is a slight loss of bluing on the slide stop and slide lock, plus the guy who owned it before me installed something on the Pickaninny rail and in doing so over tightened it, leaving three small indentions. I did not notice it at the time and he failed to mention it.. Armslist only allows three pictures so it will be hard to show everything. If you are a serious buyer/trader please don't hesitate to request additional pictures. They are already on my computer and can be easily emailed.
Upgrades:
1)	Stippled grip( follows original grip pattern)= $50
2)	Glockworx Titanium pin kit = $13.99
3)	Stainless steel Lone wolf Guide Rod Assembly=$22.99
4)	Tool works belt clip= $25.00

So as you see there is $449.59 invested, not to mention the installation of parts. So the selling price of $250 is pretty firm. I have shot about 1000 rounds through the rifle. After each time fired the action was cleaned and barrel had a dry cloth ran though it. The .22 works great with the 10 round mags, but I could not get the 30 round mags to cycle right. All I ever used was cheap bulk ammo, so maybe a better ammo would work in the 30rd mags. Adult owned and very well taken care of.

Must be face to face sale, I will not ship rifle. I am located in Bay City, but am willing to meet up somewhere closer to buyers location.

It also has what I assume is a factory target with bullet holes in it, used and signed by someone at Colt - someone may have put this in the box after the fact, but it looks pretty old to me and is signed. It has a couple brushes that I assume are original, an aluminum rod and a silver flask thing that I have no clue what it us for.

Have you seen the ""Smart"" Carry or Thunder-wear style holsters and wondered about them? Then noted the $50+ price tag? Pick up this one for substantially less. Note that the material in this product is light and is not bulky. But it will last for a long time in day to day carry of your  gun. I know at least four people carrying in one of these (even a fed,) and they've yet to wear-one-out. Additionally, it goes well with Dockers so if you happen to be adjusting things . . . well, it's not as conspicuous as those holsters made out of denim (unless of course you're wearing jeans ;-) 

You don't have to limit this to carrying your weapon. If you're traveling overseas to area where the laws are a little different and the pick pockets abound, this is a GREAT WAY to keep your ID, extra cash and credit cards from being stolen. Just step aside and refill your pocket/real wallet when needed. The spare pocket is a ""premium"" feature for the brand names, but this is always the way I make them. 

I have carried this way for several years now and can say you will not be MADE unless someone grabs you ""there."" Your wallet,/gun/spare magazine simply disappear. Can be used for full frame or small frame (medium and small work best) pistols. I have yet to see any wear marks: this style of cary is one of the best solutions yet. 

Why pay full freight to find out if you like this style of carry when you can do it for a better price. If you like it and want to pay their higher prices, well you'll know this style of carry works and can pass this holster to a friend. But, I bet this one serves you well for a long time and that you won't see the need to spend more. 

PS - I was very skeptical about this style of holster when I first saw one: afraid that it would not be safe. I have never heard of or experienced an ND or seen the trigger depressed after removing a weapon from these holsters. Additionally, I've tried pulling the trigger trough the cloth with no success.

It's built on a heavy 1.5mm receiver, as opposed to the relatively flimsy 1mm receivers WASR's and the like are built on. It has a fantastically smooth trigger. I do believe this is a stamped receiver, and not a milled one. There is a 66 in a triangle stamped on the side. I think this is the logo of the particular factory in which it was produced, but Im not sure which.

This is a preban model, and hasn't been modified from it's original configuration upon being imported.This is very similar in construction to a Mak-90, also a Norinco, but has the addition of a flash hider and bayo lug. The difference in quality between a Norinco AK and your common WASR or SAR is night and day. 

Round count unknown, but it hasn't had a lot of use, would rate it about 8/10 condition. Open to reasonable cash offers. I checked around with forums and gun buddies..They tell me this gun is worth anywhere from $800-$1100. Im Perhaps open to trades on an AR in 308 or 5.56, and Aimpoint optics. Maybe an MSAR Aug..

My name is Jon King, and I've been reloading for the past 20 years, and have extensive experience in rifle load tuning for individual rifles.  This is a family run operation, using my garage until we have a sales base large enough to move into a larger facility.  My wife, Kelly, works a full time job and also does our books.  Richard, my brother, is our full time equipment operator.  

Why start a reloading business in Billings?  Cost of ammunition is out of this world!  My motto is to supply shooters with cost effective, quality ammunition.  We love to shoot but it is expensive as you probably know.  That is why we have always reloaded our own ammunition, plus our accuracy was also better than with what we could buy from the stores.  If you have brass on hand, we can reload it at a significant cost savings to you.  Please email with any questions

This is NOT the short barreled SKS-M or Sporter with the thumbhole stock.  This is the full length carbine with the regular wood stock that was done by the factory, this is NOT a homemade conversion.  Now, about half the people that look at it seem to think i'm crazy to ask so much for an ""SKS"".  The other half know what it is, wish they could have it but don't have the money right now.  So do some research so you'll know what it is before asking questions or making comments about the price, which is only slightly negotiable depending on a couple of things.  You  must be legally able to own this gun and it's ""cash and carry"" which means I don't take checks and you pick it up.  Thanks for looking."

I have a custom 1911 built on a Caspian Tiatanium frame, Fusion slide and ramped match barrel hand fitted bushing. The frame has been bob tailed and a Ed Brown main spring housing installed. Fusion trigger group. The internals are Ed Brown. The rear sight is a Heine night sight the front is trijicon. The frame has been ""bear coated"" in flat grey which is what the military is now using and had the ""tactical package"" done to remove all sharp edges to improve the speed of drawing the pistol. Tim at TJ'S gunsmithing in Aurora did all the work except for the bear caot and tactical package which was done at Rocky Mountain Arms in Loveland. This is a high end 1911 and has all the bells and whistles. exactly 100 rounds fired 50 before coating and 50 after to check function and realability.

I bought this for my CC and desides to go another way. I payed $93.70 on 6-2-11, i have all the paperwork to show when i bought it. I tried it for one day and decided to get a different holster thats more practical for me. I'm getting ready to return this within the next week and figured i give someone a deal on it before i return it. I will get a refund less the shipping, so i'll get around $83 back. I'll sell it for $75 firm right now no less. If i dont sell it i'll get my $83 back when i return it. If interested let me know. Thanks

The upper is made by YHM and has M4 feed ramps, forward assist, and ""T"" Markings. The barrel is chambered in 5.56 N.A.T.O, 14.5"", fluted, chrome lined, 1:7"" twist, and has a YHM Phantom flash suppressor professionally permanently installed. The handguard is a YHM free-floating riffle length diamond handguard, and has the optional end-cap installed. The fit and finish is amazing on this upper and everything is 100% brand new and unfired. The 14.5"" fluted barrel looks much better than the 16"" barrels most AR's have. The barrel exceeds 16"" with the silver soldered Phantom flash suppressor, so it is legal to own in every state. The price for just the upper is $600, which is MUCH lower than I paid for it. If the buyer would like, I will include a brand new Bravo Company BCM Mil-Spec, full-auto bolt carrier group and new charging handle for an extra $100 which would total $700 for everything. I will not sell just the BCG or charging handle separately. This ad is cross posted on another forum, so the first one to send a message saying that they want it will be honored Thanks for looking.

*EDIT: This listing does not include the complete lower receiver. It was an extra lower I just built, used to demonstrate the fit and finish. I wasn't looking to sell the lower, but have had a couple interested in the complete gun. I may consider selling the complete gun with a few magazines and case. I will address any serious inquires"

I have a Smith and Wesson Model 916 pump-action 12 gauge shotgun for sale or trade. It does show some wear but functions perfectly. It holds 5+1 rounds. It includes 2 boxes of Federal Target shells, 50 shells total. I don't really have a need for a HD shotgun and don't have land to go out and shoot it regularly so it needs to go.

I am asking $170 OBO for it and the 2 boxes of shells. I would be willing to trade it for a decent .22 LR pistol or Kel Tec .380 or 9mm pistol. Send me any offer and I will at least consider it.

I have for sale a very nice Soviet Mosin Nagant M38 carbine.  As you can see, the M38 lacks the heavy and useless folding bayonet of the common M44.  Izvehsk build from 1943.  All matching, with laminate stock.  Excellent condition inside and out.  No pitting.  Counterbored muzzle, shiny lands and clean unpitted grooves.  Great shooter.  

I have fired about 50 rounds through this gun; cleaned thoroughly after each session due to corrosive ammo.  This thing is awful to shoot!  Probably the hardest kicking, loudest, most painful infantry weapon ever.  Impress your friends with the thermonuclear muzzle flash.  It is accurate though.  Shoots about 2.5-3 MOA."
