It has been fired very little as you will be able to see from the internals. I have 5 30rd mags (4 PMags) and 1 20rd mag.

Gun Registration and Ownership Tax Introduced in the New York Senate

Thursday, February 24, 2011

Please contact members of the Senate Codes Committee! 

A bill has been introduced in the New York Senate that would require gun owners to register all of their firearms.  Senate Bill 2994 has been referred to the Senate Codes Committee, but currently no hearing date has been set.


Sponsored by state Senator Eric Adams (D-20), S. 2994 would require firearms to be registered with a $15 per gun fee.  An additional $10 would be charged annually for renewal.  This registration legislation would require gun owners to list the serial number and model of every gun they own, in addition to personal information.  Gun owners know that criminals will never register their illegally possessed guns and, in fact, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Haynes v. U.S. (309 U.S. 85 (1968)) that since felons are prohibited from owning firearms, compelling them to register their guns would violate their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.  In addition, this ill-conceived legislation would constitute a substantial state tax on gun ownership.  Historically, these failed registration schemes have also been very costly for jurisdictions to maintain, and they have been completely ineffective.  Registration is a dangerous step toward confiscation and an assault on the Second Amendment. 


Please contact members of the Senate Codes Committee and respectfully ask them to oppose S. 2994.  Contact information for this committee is listed below.

If you find a gun online from out of state you want to buy then I will act as your transfer point and get the gun brought into the state for $15.

I am a Class 3 dealer as well. I can handle all of your firearms needs.

I refinish guns as well with duracoat. With over 300 colors I can make your gun match your personality. The sky is the limit as to what I can paint a gun. You name it I can do it. I have a custom airbrush artist on staff.

Want to sell a gun and not having luck on here? I offer consignment sales for you. You bring me the gun and I do everything for you to list it nationally on Gunbroker. When it sells I will cut you a business check for sale price minus 8% for my commission and Gunbroker fees. Don't pay local shops 10%+ and then only have it sit in their shop to see a few customers. Gunbroker gets millions of views daily. I have plenty of satisfied customers. I have sold guns from $150-$82,000. In four years I have had maybe 4 guns that did not sell. Just to give you an idea...Another local gunshop in charleston appraised a LC smith shotgun at $4500 and it sat in their shop for a month. He brought it to me and I appraised it at $6800. We listed it on gunbroker for $6500 and 14 days later it sold for $8825. Who do you want selling your gun???

The rifled barrel has a cantilever mount with a 3-9x32 Bushnell scope. 

The 535ATS combo was spawned by the success of the 3"" chambered 500 and the 3 1/2"" chambered 835. It will take 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" shotgun shells and is prepared to handle any of your shotgun hunting opportunities. With a simple change of barrel and/or choke tube you can go from hunting waterfowl, to upland birds, to wild turkeys, to deer and other big game.

The Hornady® SST Shotgun Slugs transform your favorite rifled barrel slug gun into a weapon that outperforms some centerfire rifles. Super-accurate bullet delivers sub-2"" groups at 100 yards; and the flattest trajectory on the market. Polymer tip helps it slice through the air, minimizing drop and wind drift. When the bullet hits its target, the tip expands violently, transferring energy payload to the target for a swift kill. 5 pack.

Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand

This is a nice home defense handgun for a great price. My local police dept carries Glock 21s, but the Glock 22 is carried by lots of police out there. You can also convert the Glock 22 to 9mm by changing the barrel and using 9mm extractor parts and 9mm magazines. I need a transmission for my car, so I am forced to cough this up.

Appleseed rifle marksmanship clinics are non-competitive, family-friendly, and open to all, from novice shooters to experts. There is a $5.00 per day charge for women, and a $2.50 per day charge for youth (under 21). Peace officers, active duty military, National Guard, reserve, disabled and elected officials shoot FREE as honored guests. For all others, the cost is only $70.00 for both days, or $45.00 for one day of instruction by some of the best rifle marksmanship instructors in the nation. Attend one day or both days.

Unless a specific host range specifies otherwise, you may shoot anything from a .22 rimfire (the Ruger 10/22 and Marlin 795 are popular) to a centerfire such as an AR, AK, SKS, M1A or M1. You will shoot approximately 250 rounds per day as you try to qualify as a Rifleman (210 Points) on a modified version of the AQT (Army Qualification Test) course of fire.

The number of slots for each shoot is limited, so pre-registration is highly encouraged to make sure a spot on the line is reserved for you. Politics are not discussed at Appleseed shoots, except for the politics of 1775. NOTE: Participation in an Appleseed shoot meets the marksmanship requirement of the Civilian Marksmanship Program to purchase a vintage M1 Garand rifle at a DEEP discount. The Revolutionary War Veterans Association (RWVA) is a CMP affiliated organization.

I would be happy to answer any questions you have about the specifics of an Appleseed event. As of right now, we have the following shoots scheduled for Kentucky. More shoots may be added throughout the year.

I have lost count how much I have shot this gun so I am guessing at 1500 to 2000 rounds. It is a tack driver. It was a hunting gun so it has a few scuffs and scratches. For some I just noticed taking it out of the safe that some of the screws that hold the weaver style mounts to the barrel on the 7 inch barrel have began to rust. I tried getting a hold of Smith and Wesson this week and am awaiting their reply but it appears to fall under the lifetime service program. All this retails for over $350 so if it doesn't sell before I get it fixed from S&W that is ok.
This gun is a tack driver and very reliable but I only run hyper velocity ammo through it like CCI or Win Super X. I found that to solve all my problems with my Remington 597 so I just use good ammo in any Semi Auto .22. I have shot prairrie dogs at 40 yards with the 7 inch barrel numerous times so it isn't just a lucky shot.
Will not sell to anyone not allowed to possess a firearm. Valid Drivers license but prefer current CCW for verification.

Will fit most tactical or under-carriers and is lightweight, in good shape and offers great protection at a real good price. It is used but still servicable and is not all stained or stinky. This fits an XL fine and will adjust up or down a size or two, however the panels will fit most commercial carriers. The panels are approx 15""tallX18""wide, but are of course contoured to a torso.

The second is a Silent Partner Lvl IIIA vest. It comes with an additional soft strike plate for the front panel and I will include a stretch velcro soft carrier with it. The panels are servicable and offer very good protection for a low price. This will also fit a large or XL just fine and can be placed in other carriers for other fits.

*To answer some common questions.....
*I have had a lot of fleeting interest in these vests. If your serious then contact me! The vests are in good shape and this is legit. I have no need for several extra vests laying around so I will sell them this cheap! IT IS NOT ILLEGAL TO BUY OR WEAR A VEST IN INDIANA. Just so you know, it does elevate an offense if you commit a crime while wearing one (to summarize) and NO I will not SHIP the item elsewhere. Face to face purchase in Indiana. Thanks.**"

Note from seller : 
I take down all advertisements immediately after selling the item. If the product is still visible it is still available for sale and/or trade. DO NOT MESSAGE ME ASKING ""Do you still have ___ ?"" 

*If you do ask, don't be a fucking retard, take a few seconds to read the whole reply email; I don't have time to specify what you asked about my still having. There is a fucking active, blue colored, and underlined link to the add in the email with ""regarding post"" preceding it. 

Do not offer less than what I ask unless you believe the price to be a typographical error. I do not gain anything from my sales and am already taking a loss. If you can get it cheaper elsewhere, then don't complain to me, it's bad enough to get ripped off once. 

Do not ask How much of the product is available when both the title and description specify the quantity in plain English.

Shipping and FFL fees are not free. Add them to the price if you want me to ship an item to you.

My time is my own. Gas is not free. If you live more than 20 miles away, and want me to deliver, you will cover some of my expenditure and inconvenience."

Note that these all have a 20inch barrel, I could not even find one for sale with the 16inch barrel. Check the prices on these and then make an offer for what you think this rare collector's piece is worth. I'm not asking anything outrageous, but let's be serious, this is worth more than a non-collectors edition rifle of the same model and caliber, so please be serious and make your offer accordingly.

Narrow walnut grips, traditional hammer spur, coil mainspring, drop-out trigger group, and unbreakable Beryllium firing pin.  This is a very good quality gun unlike the later Charco and Charter 2000 guns.

Revolver is in very good condition with a few minor scuffs from the usual holster wear.  Has been cleaned, oiled, and test fired.  Functions flawlessly with a very nice trigger pull.  You can fire +P ammo through this lightweight 16 oz steel framed revolver, but it is recommended that you stick to standard loads for practice.  Comes with a custom belt holster and 2 speedloaders.

I'm not in a hurry to sell this revolver, but it is valued at 275 and I'd like to get some trade offers for this.  My wife likes .25 ACP pistols, and I am looking for a Colt Junior/Actra Cub/FIE Best or a Beretta 950 INOX Jetfire, or even a FIE Titan, +/- cash depending on trade.  Would also be interested in a Ruger Single-Six in .22 WMR.

I'm open to any trade offer for interesting handguns in .25 ACP or .22 WMR only.

I'm always interested in .25 ACP ammo or 8X57mm Mauser hunting ammo as well.

Up for sale (see trade considerations below) is a VERY GOOD condition (round count well below 500) S&W Bodyguard in 380 Auto. This is the carry gun that comes stock with an Insight laser. I'm the 2nd owner of this gun. Bought last fall from a guy who put a couple magazines through it and liked the 38 special version of this better.

Package includes original box, original S&W factory portfolio/day planner style holster, a pack of A-Zoom snap caps for trigger time, 2 boxes of Aguila 90 grain hollow point rounds, and the icing on the top, a Crossbreed MiniTuck holster, and 1 six round magazine with the extended floorplate. Flat floor plate is also include in the box as is the original S&W handgun loop-thru style master lock.

Absolutely NOTHING wrong with this setup. Need to fund the http://www.HausofGuns.com hobby (where reviews can be seen on the Bodyguard AND Crossbreed) and the wife's getting ticked about me dipping in to the family funds to do so.

It's been carried very little and would make an excellent CCW option for someone not interested in changing their whole wardrobe to carry. Original value of all items new is approximately $625 before tax. I'm asking $450 for the whole thing and prefer not to separate the group.

Trade options considered are S&W MPc (9mm or 40), Glock 22, 23. Feel free to be creative but please don't get pissed if I turn you down. I live in the Greeley area and require FTF meeting and am willing to drive short distances to help meet up and save gas costs. No bill of sale required but I do expect to see LEGAL driver's license and/or CCW is preferred."

(upgraded Walnut stocks, dual action arms and 26"" & 28"" vent rib bbl) and My Charter Arms AR-7 .22 LR (modified) for an AK47 or AK74 variant. The 500A is circa 1987 and has served me well hunting birds over the years. It is the Regal-combo version that came with a 26"" rifled and rifle sight BBL and a 28"" vent ribbed BBL. It features walnut stocks and an upgraded finish. It has about 400 rds of bird shot through it (28"" BBL) and the slug BBL has been fired about 10 times. I would put the finish and condition at about 95%. The AR-7 has been modified with a dress up ""tacticool"" kit(no counting for teenager's tastes) with a heat shield and a 25rd Ramline magazine. I recently replaced the extractor, which seemed to be a problem for the Charter Arms AR-7 version. To restore it to fold into it's butt stock all you need is the Barrel nut ($18 at AR-7.com) and a replacement ""stock"" magazine(last that I checked CDNN had 'em for $10). I just took it to the range on Monday and it shoots great the tacticool way that it is.



I'm looking to trade both for an AK47 0r an AK74. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it does have to ""go bang"" when I pull the trigger and cycle correctly.
