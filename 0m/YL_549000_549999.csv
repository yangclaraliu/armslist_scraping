Price is firm.  No trades.  If you want a great rifle, here you go.  You can build this bad boy up with all the furniture you want and at the core you'll have a great rifle.  If you want a Frankengun parted together to look cool.  Look elsewhere.  Used rifle and I am the second owner.  First owner works with me and the gun has been well taken care of with approximately 300 to 400 rounds through it.  It is a rifle, it is supposed to be shot.

Check the reviews on this rifle, they are great.  The ones putting that it was covered in metal shavings are not that smart.  It is the metallic colored foam flakes from the packing material, not metal shavings.  Yes, the gun came covered in grease, it is supposed to come covered in grease to prevent rusting.  Anyway, upgraded stock, ammo, minus the FFL transfer fee and tax and $600 is a great deal."

Per Hornady:

Features:
V-MAX™ Bullets

Hornady’s V-MAX bullets consistently achieve rapid fragmentation at all practical varmint shooting velocities.
Hand Inspected

Every Varmint Express cartridge is hand inspected before leaving our factory, ensuring there are no cosmetic flaws and imperfections.
Powder

Each cartridge is loaded to ensure optimal pressure, velocity, accuracy and lot-to-lot consistency.
Select Brass

Hornady produces most of the brass for Hornady Varmint Express ammunition. All of the brass is chosen to ensure it meets our high standards for reliable feeding, corrosion resistance, proper hardness and the ability to withstand maximum chamber pressures.
Primers

Like the powder, each primer is carefully matched to individual loads, and all are chosen for their ability to quickly, completely and reliably ignite the powder charge.

Depending on the caliber, Hornady Varmint Express ammunition is loaded with Hornady V-MAX, HP, or NTX bullets."

I've got a long lever and a short lever. Long lever 1887 gun, asking $850 obo WITH bayonet, short lever 1877 gun, asking $475 obo. BUY THEM BOTH FOR $1200 AND I WILL THROW IN A BOX OF MILSURP AMMO!
The $850 price listed on the ad is for the LONG LEVER WITH BAYONET ONLY. Please read!


The long lever comes with an original bayonet, the short lever does not. If you buy BOTH rifles as a package, I'll throw in a box of milsurp 450/577 ammo. The long lever was built in 1887 and is a true war piece of history from the African campaign. I bought it from a M/H collecters estate and it has never been rearsenaled that I can tell. I have never shot this weapon. Bore is dark but has good rifling. It will come with the bayonet shown. Good solid piece of history. The rifle is probably worth quite a bit more than I'm asking, but I don't really have a way to look up the value of it. So I'm gonna say $850 obo for the rifle and bayonet. Pictured the darker rifle in the first picture."

This is either a project car or a parts car for someone. The transmission us going out so it will need to either be repaired or replaced. Not sure what's wrong with it but as it heats up it starts to act up. I wouldn't trust it to far right now. It has a little over 172000 miles on it. Mostly highway miles.

In the past year I've replaced:
Throttle body
Battery
Crank position sensor
Electric fan
Both engine coolant lines
Driver side door due to the metal failing around the lock

I've done regular oil changes using synthetic oil since I've owned it.

It has a clean title.
It's been awesome car but I don't really have the time or money to put into it anymore.

The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance.

A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon.

Pocket on side with two compartments. Very comfy handle (much more so than my Midway rifle case).

The pic with the shotgun will give you a sense of sizing - that shotgun measures 38 1/4"" long and fits comfortably in this case. A 20"" barrel shotgun will probably not fit unless you have a shortened fixed stock or an adjustable stock. Carbine should fit unless it's scoped.

Driveshaft redone within 5k miles
All work done by same mechanic in Denver
All records available
Clean title
second seat (Corbin)
hard side saddle bags
fairings included (not shown in pictures)

The bad:
speedometer cable needs to have its connections cleaned, reads at about 20 mph under actual speed.  (instrument cluster is otherwise working, tach and gauges all read correctly)
I live at the top of a big friggin hill in the mountains and the bike will need to be towed to central city or idaho springs as the road to my house is too rough for this kind of bike)
The previous owner (I'm owner #3) dropped the bike in his driveway at probably 1mph as his inseam was too short so the front fairing has a couple small cracks and there are a couple of places which could use a touch of paint.

I can tow the bike nearby, but can not tow into the Denver area as my truck is overheating.

Looking for cash, a good 4x4, big boy toys especially the ones that go bang and possibly other things in trade.  Please no low ballers, I understand what these bikes demand in this kind of condition.

It was manufactured in November of 1948 according to the date code stamped on the barrel,(R TT). It has the original 1907 sling and sling swivels, that are in good shape. It is all original, including the Lyman 57RS rear aperture sight that is in great shape, with very positive click adjustments, and the plain square post patridge style front sight. It also has the oversized ""Target Style"" bolt handle. There is a rear sight blank in the barrel dovetail that is factory original, too. The barrel shows light surface corrosion but no pitting. The bore and muzzle crown are in perfect shape. The stock has no cracks or chips but shows some wear, very good for a 64 year old gun, though! This model was one of a few that only had ""Model 521-T"" stamped on the barrel with no ""Youth Special"" or ""Junior Special"" markings on it, so the stock has a full 13"" length of pull. It is incredibly accurate and feeds any .22 S,L or LR cartridge from the magazine. Included with the rifle is a 6 round magazine and an extra 10 round magazine, along with an exact reproduction owner's manual. This is a great shooter AND collector for a very good price."

I am the original owner and I've only used it lightly. Its in really nice condition as you can see and it shoots great. Its perfect for when you can't conceal anything larger! It comes with a hard plastic case and two magazines (one original and one aftermarket). I will also send you at least one used holster for it -- two if I can find the other one! The price is $210 (postal money order or cashiers check only) shipped to the FFL in the lower 48 of your choice. The gun will ship after payment has cleared and my FFL and received a copy of your FFL's license. Sale is of course final, so please ask any questions prior to buying.

For local buyers, I've had a past experience selling a firearm locally and privately that wasn't the best in the world, so unfortunately you will have to go through an FFL. You can come to my FFL who is also located in Lake Worth, or I am more than happy to have the weapon shipped to any FFL of your choice. Please keep in mind that if you do not have a concealed permit that Palm Beach County has a waiting period of I believe 5 days, so if you are not close to here, you should pick a FFL close to you to avoid having to make the drive twice. 

I can be reached by email at REDACTED. Please note that this item is listed on gunbroker and more pictures can be found there. It is first come, first serve.

I bought the gun to get the scope. I was told it fired and cycled fine. I cleaned it a little and removed the scope. Some bluing wear, but seems mechanically sound with a slick action and very little wear. Sold as is, seeing as I've never shot it and don't own any 30-06, for $150. It's just not my style.

Terrible realization, but thats life unfortunately... With that being said I'm in not dying for the money so any lowball offers will be deleted immediately. 

The gun:
Arsenal 2 stage polished trigger and polished fire control group
RAM bolt on trigger gaurd
Very nice tapco wood furniture kit
Dinzag front hand gaurd retainer
Dinzag gas tube
Pistol grip nut/bolt
Non bolt hold open tab FCG
Ak scope mount that attaches to the rail on the side of the reciever
More than i can remember to be honest...

It's a high quality gun that was built using the best components I could get my hands only looks like a real deal ak47 but it fires the very potent 7.62x51 NATO cartridge. It comes with the factory 8rd magazine, never got around or even found it necessary for the 25rd mags seeing I built the rifle for hunting, not ammo dumping.


For the business end though, like I said I would like to get some cash out of this but it can be a partial trade as well, I enjoy quality 9mm handguns... I thoroughly enjoy underfolding non century built ak47's as well along with some cash.

I can't tell that it was ever fired and has been very well kept. You just don't find them this nice. It is what is called a Model Pre-10 because it has no model on it, but is the M&P Model 10 design. It comes with the original 50ct box of Western X rounds from that era. They are also in fine condition. Firm on the cash price."
