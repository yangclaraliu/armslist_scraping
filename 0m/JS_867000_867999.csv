Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special, I will assume you are a fucking retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."

Not an AK expert, but what I know from reading up on the rifles here http://www.ak-47.us/Article_Detail.php?g=contentREDACTED is that these rifles were made with original Soviet AK manufacturing equipment and is considered the closest to the Soviet AK you could purchase at the time.  

The Cons: 2nd owner so I do not know full history of rifle or round count, but the finish is, well horrible which from my understanding is common trait of Egyptian AK’s. Looks like an 8 year old painted it with spray paint. It has several scratches on the finish as well.  If you want pristine, you'll want to pass, or refinish it. Mechanically this rifle is in excellent condition. It will come with 2 surplus steel mags, but these both have some rough patches on the finish like there was some surface rust that was cleaned off in the past.  It does have a bit of mag wobble, but it doesn't affect function. 

Pros: It is still an Egyptian AK, and is much more desirable than the current run of the mill WASR-10's and relatively rare. Based on the receiver markings the ACC/Intrac ARM rifles. Rifle runs 100% with every type of round. It has been upgraded to lose the God awful thumbhole stock with the proper number American made parts (stock, pistol grip handguards, gas piston, complete trigger). 

Selling because, well it just doesn't get shot much (probably because I don’t have any 7.62x39 ammo). Can send more pics upon request.

$900. If shipping, buyer covers actual shipping/insurance costs and if necessary any additional FFL fee's on my end.

NOTE: New to ArmsList and I learned fast that it's a great community! I've done 6 Cash, Face To Face meetings in the past 2 weeks with ArmsList Sellers totaling $4300!. All have been unbelievably nice, intelligent people with excellent communication skills (and punctual for meetings too...bonus). I could easily become friends with each and every one of them. Looking forward to working with other NH ArmsList community members.

I think it would be okay for this item to be shipped to me. I'll pay for shipping and probably send you a Money Order. If you are close, I could drive to your area and we can meet in the parking lot of a local business of your choice.

302,http://www.armslist.com/posts/867302,For Sale:  Barrett REC7,"Chicago, Chicago, Illinois","$ 1,850","Listed On: Thursday, January 17, 2013",Rifles,Barrett                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"The Barrett REC7 is a powerful and reliable rifle styled in the familiar AR configuration. It's a no-nonsense rifle designed to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced-reliability carbine. The REC7 exceeds expectations operators demand from today's new breed of piston-operated rifles. 

The REC7 rifle's dependability stems from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, resulting in reduced maintenance requirements and increased endurance. 

The patented, chrome-lined, fluted gas chamber design prevents excessive carbon buildup from impairing operation under adverse conditions. This in turn allows the one-piece, 17-4 stainless piston to transfer energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face. There is no separate gas key to shoot loose, and the nickel Teflon coating increases lubricity and simplifies cleaning. The Barrett Enhanced Piston Bolt is made from nickel Teflon coated 9310 steel. The bolt's gas ring-free design is easy to clean and operates smoothly. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance. 

At the heart of the system is the nitrided, two-position (suppressed/unsuppressed) gas regulator that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the gas block without removing the handguard, so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be re-zeroed after routine maintenance. The top of the gas block also has an integral 1913 rail, extending the rail length for mounting accessories or sights. 

The REC7 rifle's forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are type 3 hardcoat anodized. The lower houses an ultradependable, mil-spec single stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, 16-inch hammer forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into both the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle."

  Sales Order: 

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience on Gunbroker and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information: 

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special, I will assume you are a fucking retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

If you look on gunbroker you will see that there is not a single one of these on buyitnow for less than 2K and anything that is nearing end of bidding is over 2K. Watch out for the scammers on here selling them for really cheap! There is a reason there are no really cheap ones on gunbroker! And don't buy an unconverted one thinking youll get it converted soon - the companies doing quality conversions hava a 5-6 month wait time!  

Why convert? Here is a great write up to undertand that this shotgun was designed by the same guy who designed the AK47, and they are made in his factory! But they have to be degraded to bring into the us.

What’s the difference between Eagle Arms and ArmaLite?
ANSWER:  There are normally very few differences.  ArmaLite rifles are the top of the company’s line.  They tend to be more up to date and include higher quality parts such as chrome lined barrels.  They are produced from selected forging.  However, internally, they use exactly the same parts.  Eagle Arms rifles are intended to compete with lower priced brands. They are extremely high quality rifles in their own right.  ArmaLite used to use only “ArmaLite” lower receivers for actual factory built guns and sold “Eagle Arms” as stripped lower and upper receivers.  This was to differentiate between the two different warranties.  ArmaLite has a lifetime warranty and EA has a one year only warranty."

If you look on gunbroker you will see that there is not a single one of these on buyitnow for less than 2K and anything that is nearing end of bidding is over 2K. Watch out for the scammers on here selling them for really cheap! There is a reason there are no really cheap ones on gunbroker! And don't buy an unconverted one thinking youll get it converted soon - the companies doing quality conversions hava a 5-6 month wait time!  

Why convert? Here is a great write up to undertand that this shotgun was designed by the same guy who designed the AK47, and they are made in his factory! But they have to be degraded to bring into the us.

If you look on gunbroker you will see that there is not a single one of these on buyitnow for less than 2K and anything that is nearing end of bidding is over 2K. Watch out for the scammers on here selling them for really cheap! There is a reason there are no really cheap ones on gunbroker! And don't buy an unconverted one thinking youll get it converted soon - the companies doing quality conversions hava a 5-6 month wait time!  

Why convert? Here is a great write up to undertand that this shotgun was designed by the same guy who designed the AK47, and they are made in his factory! But they have to be degraded to bring into the us.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will. 

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.  ­

Predator Upper Receiver/Barrel Assembly's 20"" Fluted Extra Heavy Barrel is button rifled 1 x 8"" to stabilize the heavier 69-77 grain bullets that a predator hunter/caller would choose for bigger varmints and predators. This superb barrel features fluting for increased cooling and weight reduction; an 11 degree competition crown; 1"" diameter heavy profile under the handguard; custom match hybrid chamber with a tighter SAAMI Spec headspace from the shoulder of the chamber to the bolt face, and longer chamber throat or ""Leade"". This chamber accommodates 5.56mm ammunition without developing higher pressures encountered when firing 5.56mm ammo in a .223 chamber with shorter ""Leade"" (both calibers can be used safely). This Upper is sold complete with Bolt, Bolt Carrier and Charging Handle to ensure positive lockup between bolt and barrel extension. The Predator Upper also features a Vented Tubular Aluminum Free-Floater Forend with Bipod Stud (free-floats the barrel from the barrel nut forward) and B.M.A.S. 1/2"" Mini-Risers to add scope height for correct sight picture and comfortable cheek weld.

Trades
 -Quality AR-15 optics as a partial trade. Not looking for a scope more along the lines of an Aimpoint M2 or similar.
 -Ammo- 5.56/.223, 9mm, and .308 
-Would also consider a few handguns as partial trade. If trading for a handgun I would require to do face to face In Colorado at a dealer. Might be interested in XD/XDM 9 compact, M&P 9mm, Taurus Judge, possibly a couple other compacts. 
If shipped you are responsible for knowing all state and federal laws. If face to face valid DL to prove your age is required if I question it and you must be legal to own a firearm. 

I had one buyer back out after I turned another potential buyer away so I wont hold the rifle the first person that can meet with the money will get it."
