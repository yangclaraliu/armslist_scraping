The bolt had to be modified by a gunsmith to allow for a normal style scope (not long eye relief).  I bought a kit to do it, but a gunsmith had a better idea, and fabricated the parts.  Before I went to all this trouble I searched through hundreds of these rifles to find one with a perfect bore.  I wanted a real shooter.  After I had my shooter I then acquired all the accessories... The leather shoulder strap, the stripper clips, the original cleaning kits and tool set, even the bayonet, and a big hard case for it all.  I just don't have anywhere to shoot this bad boy.  I don't like having guns I don't shoot.  That defeats the fun.  If you need a good elk gun, this is your gun.  If you want a monster centerfire  rifle on  a budget, this is your gun.  I have decided that I want to get more .22lr stuff.  I want to trade for a good scoped .22lr tack driver.  I might consider a NAA Earl, or NAA belt buckle gun.

Also, I can swap out the carry-handle with an Eotech (genuine) holographic sight.  It has been used only a few times, and minus some (very) minor scratches on the protective hood is brand new.  It has also had a GG&G quick-detach throw lever (80-100 bucks by itself) installed so it literally can pop on and off the rifle in a matter of seconds, yet still retain a near perfect zero every time.

I greatly prefer cash, so if a trade is involved I'd only be able to give a majority-percentage of whatever market value is on your item.  Cash plus or minus depending on the item, obviously fills the difference.  Please don't hesitate to throw me an offer if interested in getting into the AR-15 market."

.45 caliber with 5 inch barrel and blue finish.  Model 05870.

1) Gunsmith milled slide to replace staked front sight with a dove tailed front site.
2) Gunsmith reduced trigger pull (~3.5 lbs give or take - may measure it again soon)
3) Gunsmith Fitted (Briley) front bushing
4) Added extended safety
5) Added wider magazine well extension (easily removed).
6) Added an expanded magazine release thumb pad.
7) Titanium firing pin installed (from a series 70).  This disables the series 80 firing pin block plunger - but it can be easily reinstalled and also the series 80 titinium firing pin could be used  thus restoring the firing pin block safety function.  This 3rd trigger safety (after grip and thumb safeties) makes the gun more 'drop safe' -though some say no 1911's have ever fired when dropped anyway).
8) Extended (beavertail) grip safety (to reduce 'slide bite').
9) Lightweight Aluminum trigger (with adjustable stop)
11) Switched to ""wrap around"" Pachymar rubber grips.  Original checkered wood grips available.
12) Adjustable (ELLISASON) rear sights.
13) (Might have widened the ejection port area a little)
14) Full length guide rod (screws together).  Could swith back to regular recoil spring rod and plug too.
15)Match grade barrel.  Top of slide machined to reduce glare (came stock).

This gun shoots accurately, fast, and flawlessly and does not limit the shooter in any way.

Works flawlessly with all kinds of ammo types.

Lots of magazines come with it ((3) x 11 rounders, (3) x 10 rounders, and (6) x  8  rounders).  The 8 rounders have extended base pads on them.
(Masking tape is on the 11 rounders to indicate their capacity in a glance).

Original Owner purchased it at a VA gun shop (1984) and had more than one gunsmith add modications to it.  Have the original box, wooden grips, and user's guide (C@1983). 

All laws apply on Cash sale.  No trades at this time.

p.s.  There may be some faint 'lack of shine' (mild) on the rear slide area .  See pictures.

One negative.  A scratch on the slide might look like a 'hairline crack' but it is not upon looking closer (Pics of this available upon request).  They've been making these guns too long (since 1905+) for that type of design error to exist after millions of copies being made all over the world.

Tape placed on 11 round magazines to tell them apart from 10 rounders.

I need to make this a quick sale for because the tax man is coming to get me again and I need to get some extra cash.  I really do not want to sell this shotgun, it has been nothing but flawless for me since I received it as payment from a friend who owed me some money.  This was his personal shutgun he carried while he was on duty (police officer).   This shutgun will support 2 3/4 and 3"", holds 7-1 and has a 20"" barrel.   I did not know about the value of this particular firearm before I accepted it from my friend and took it to 2 local gun stores.  The first store in OKC told me they did not stock it, but can order them for $600,  the second store in Newcastle told me that it was worth about $575.  I will sell this to the first person who offers me $450 because I am honestly in a pinch for cash.  This will be a fantastic deal for the person who gets it.  I am perfectly willing to let this go if for $450 if it sells quickly.  I am putting up two other auctions for handguns and will be selling those well under their stated values.  I will be open and honest, I need to raise $890 rather quickly, and figure if I put up quality firearms, and offer a genuine price below their value, I should be able to raise the money quickly.  I will guarantee that when this is behind me and I have some money in my pocket again, I will be ordering me a replacement Browning BPS of this model.  It has honsetly been that good of a firearm.
You can email me or call me for any questions.  It would probably be better to call me because I am going to be on the road quite a bit for the next 2 days and will be able to respond much faster via phone.  I may be reached at REDACTED

I am more than willing to take a loss on this gun, (and for that matter 2 others I am posting) in order to get this situation behind me.  I have only put 25 rounds through it, and cleaned and oiled it after its only use.  I will also give a full box of 45colt ammo to the person who purchases this gun.

The Laser Sight is designed to withstand extremely high impact shock generated by large caliber rifles and hand guns and is equally at home on a rifles picatinny rail forends or on handguns bottom rail. Turning the laser on is easily done with the on/off slide switch and can also be bypassed by adding a cable pressure switch (included) which is securely screwed to the back of the laser. It produces a highly visible intense green laser beam for accurate targeting day or night. Standard windage and elevation adjustments are accessible externally on the front side and bottom of the laser.

I am selling a good-looking and lightly used AR-180B and three 30 round thermold magazines, with a solid and dependable ACE folding stock to fold for storage. 

This rifle is just great, based on a design by Stoner to fix the many shortcomings of the AR-15, it is a much simpler, more reliable, piston driven design. As a result, maintenance is easy, and nowhere near as necessary as with an AR-15.

The design itself could be described as before it's time, as it has been co-opted into several modern rifles, including the ACR and the British SA80. 


 I am more than willing to drive as far as Houston or San Antonio in order to facilitate a FTF transfer. Any further than that and the buyer will pay for gas depending on how far you need me to drive.

If it needs to be shipped, I will work out the cost of shipping with you. 

I'll gladly provide more pictures upon your request."

Of course it's a Ruger so it's got a very strong, ultra reliable frame to handle the magnum rounds easily.  I put in a lighter spring to lighten up the trigger pull to pretty close to my other Ruger which is at about 9-10 lbs from the original 14.  I do have the original 14 pound spring as well in case you want it.  This is a very good deal on a great all around gun that will bring down anything on 2 or 4 legs in North America (ok - a moose may need a couple shots...lol)."

I am selling or trading a .38 special S&W airlite Ti. It is hammer less which is awesome for concealed carry. It is a great and very light gun with very controllable recoil. The package will include many accessories and ammo that would probably total up to what the gun is worth. It comes with a deep conceal shoulder holster, a boot hard leather holster, a pocket holster, a in the waistband holster, a box of 20 cor-bon defense rounds in a box, 2 speed loaders, and a loose 9 rounds of defense ammo. I am open to any offers, the worst I can say is no. You can email me to let me know what you think. If you will be trading a firearm, please include the serial number and a picture.

Just don't have the time to reload .223 anymore.  I just priced out the brass (clean and deprimed of course) at Cabelas and on sale it was $23 for a pack of hundred.  That's .23 cents per case.  I think asking just under .12 cents per case is pretty fair price.

Brass is a mix of PMC .223 and Federal / Lake City 5.56 nato.  Some rounds have been tumbled and all still have the spent primer in them.  All and all brass is in really good shape.  Some have the usual small dent, but that gets knocked out when you deprime/resize.

I acquired this rifle a 6 weeks ago and since I was on vacation this week I decided to put a few rounds through it. It is a good shooter and very accurate. I always wanted one. As luck would have it I find myself being more a semi-auto kinda person. So I'm going to put it up for sale or trade. Since it did not come with any paperwork I called Remington and their reply is below.

The gun is roughly two years old. The gun is in pristine condition with no marks or wear. It has only been fired approx. 250-325 times. The main reason I'm selling it is because I no longer have an interest in trapshooting nor hunting plus I have to many Benellis. 

     What's Included: The gun of course :), 5 choke tubes ( M, IM, C, F, and IC), trigger lock ( never used ), Benelli hard case, shims, choke remover, and I will throw in a 12G cleaning kit. The only thing I do not have with the gun is the adjustable combs. I also do believe there is still two years left on the factory warranty. Pictures can also be seen on the website. I can also send you pictures of any part of the gun you want via text message. REDACTED

      I did some research online on the Benelli website and saw brand new this gun is going for a little under 2000.00 ( that's with the adjustable combs ) due to not having them and being a used gun I'm willing to let the gun go for 1625.00 OBO. I know that seems a little high for a used gun but this gun is basically brand new. The gun was also cleaned BEFORE and AFTER every shooting. 

     This gun makes a fantastic skeet gun due its inertia driven system and very low recoil. When I say very low I mean low!! I have seven Benellis and not one has ever jammed on me. One of them has been shot well over 12,000 times with not one jam. For pictures please send E-mail and I will send a text message via cell phone or you can look on the Benelli website. Also on the Benelli website you can see specs and a cool video about this gun :) Thanks for taking the time to read this post. Sorry I don't have pictures on here, but will send them :)"
