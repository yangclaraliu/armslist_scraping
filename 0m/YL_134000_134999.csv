I also installed an EOTech red dot optic which is one of the best. This rifle also has the collapsible stock. Included in the sale will be 4 magazines, 3 boxes of rounds and a tactical carrying case. My AR is in perfect condition, absolutely like brand new and so are the accessories. It has only had 120 rounds fired through it but you cannot tell. PERFECT CONDITION!

Only negative is the plastic binding between the 2 pieces of glass for the hood pulled apart from repeated use of opening and closing the hood during feeding, should only cost a few bucks to get a new plastic strip. I never bothered because it still opens/closes the same without it.

This would be an awesome tank for saltwater because is more of a ""cube"" shape than your standard 55gal.

The gun has been shot about 200 times.  It shoots like a dream without jamming and deadly accurate.  The P89 has a decocker on both sides which makes it safer since you can lower the hammer with a round still in the chamber.
For Mother's Day '11 I purchased and installed a Laserlyte for the Mrs.  With it she was putting rounds on a 1"" grouping at 25 feet.  The gun comes with the original rear sight, laser adjusting wrenches and one set of extra batteries.
It is an excellent handgun.  Price is firm since I don't mind keeping it."

This is beautiful Remington Model 81 Auto-loading rifle in 300 Savage 
The rifle also is a take-down, makes transporting and cleaning a breeze

These rifles are no longer made 
This rifle was manufactured in May of 1949 as per The Remington Arms Company. 
It has the Williams Gun Sight company receiver sight mounted on it.
Stock is in great condition, just a couple small normal wear marks on it considering the age of this rifle, its in great shape.

This rifle is all original and the bore is bright and shiny and has been well taken care of. 
This is personal family rifle and has been in the family since new. It has NEVER had a scope mounted on it
so there are no mounting holes in it that would have had to been made to mount the scope. 
The Williams Gun Sight rear receiver is all original and was order with the rifle when it was new.

I am a collector of military rifles and this rifle is just sitting in the safe and not in the realm of what I collect.
I would consider trades, especially military rifles. Also looking for a Ruger Gunsite Scout rifle.

Selling for $525 OBO

518,http://www.armslist.com/posts/134518,For Sale:  Beeman R7 .177 pellet rifle,"Lawrenceville, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 125,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 10, 2011",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I bought this fine air rifle (the Cadillac of the industry) for my grandson at $359.00, but my daughter refused to let my grandson have it. I have put maybe 50 pellets through it; it's barely broken in. It comes with the gun's original registration, about 500 pellets, and I'll throw in BSDA rifle scope.

The R7 air rifle is, without question, the finest intermediate sporting air rifle available anywhere. We guarantee that once you have one in your hands you will agree, and won't want to put the air rifle down. At just a shade over 6 pounds, the R7 is easy to pack around in the field, or for women and smaller shooters to handle with ease. The gun still packs plenty of punch with velocities reaching 700 fps in the .177 caliber version. This rifle is also offered in .20 caliber for those who prefer the advantages of the slightly larger and heavier pellet. The R7 is extremely accurate, and has a very pleasant, smooth firing action; in fact, the R7 is a favored rifle among the Beeman employees and our top dealers.

The R7 rifle features a unique double jointed cocking lever which eliminates the customary long slot under the forearm of break barrel air rifles. This provides a more comfortable grip and a better sling mounting point on the forearm. 

Pay attention to the details on this air rifle: Crisp, multi-lever trigger with full adjustability. Finest non-drying breech and piston seals. Checkering on the pistol grip and a rubber butt plate. Click micrometer rear sight, and scope grooves cut directly into the receiver for added stability. Beautiful precision cast trigger guard. The satin finish on the hardwood stock resists minor scratches. Simply put, there are few guns made with all the features, style and grace of the R7."

Right off the bat, I'll tell you that you can go on to Wicked Laser's website right now and order this very laser for $299.99. However, I won't take anything close to that. The FDA (yes FDA) has put an import ban on any handheld laser above 5mw. This particular laser is 200x more powerful then what current import allows. Actually getting your hands on one of these is VERY diffcult. I'm a GM for UPS and even with my connections in customs, it still took me 6 1/2 months to get a hold of mine. From what I'm told 85% of these are seized.

However, once you DO have one, they are pretty incredible. It will burn or melt most things dark colored. You can cut through plastics, light cigs, pop ballons, start fires, etc. The beam is so powerful that if you pointed it straight up in the air, no only can you see the beam the entire way up, but the only reason it doesn't hit outter space is because our inner atmosphere diffuses the beam. If you were at sea, and pointed the beam straight out infront of you, the only reason you aren't able to see it past a certain point is because of the curvature of the Earth.

I understand this isn't what you typically see, so if you have any questions feel free to ask."

Production and quality of this pistol (which was produced in at least two versions, short-barreled PHP MV 9 and long-barreled PHP VM 17) was sporadic, and it was soon replaced in production and use by the HS 2000 pistol. 

By design, this pistol represents a mix between Beretta 92 and Walther P38 pistols. The basic short-recoil operated action with vertically tilting locking piece is similar to both pistols, the general appearance of the open-top slide is close to the Walther but the single return spring below the barrel is apparently an Italian influence. Trigger is of traditional double action type, and the safety consists of a manual decocking lever, located on the left side of the grip frame. Magazines are double-stack and hold 15 cartridges (2 mags total with each pistol).

This Croatian weapon is relatively rare, since production ceased after a short run and did not pick up again until after the breakup of the former Yugoslavia was well underway. The weapon is essentially a version of the Walther P-38; though it looks very different externally, the breech locking, trigger, and decocking system are the same. The only real improvement is the high-capacity magazine and the protection for the barrel."

I have a Steyr USR rifle (1 of only 3000 imported to the US), that I would like to sell.  I have taken it to the range only a couple times, and have probably put 250-300 rounds down the pipe.  

I purchased an authentic AUG stock and foregrip (both in OD green), and currently have that stock and grip on the rifle, but I still have the USR stock and grip in factory gray, that I am also including in the sale, so really, you are almost buying two rifles in one.  The pics I have attached are of the rifle as it was when I bought it, but as I said, I purchased a true AUG stock and foregrip in OD green, and currently have it set up with those.  I can send pics of that if you want.  Serious inquiries only.  This is a rare rifle, and worth every penny I am asking.  Here is what is included in the sale.

Steyr USR .223 rifle (as seen in pictures)
Steyr AUG Stock and Foregrip in OD Green (currently installed)
Two 30 round magazines
Soft tactical case
Interchangeable picatinny rail (for removing the factory scope and installing an aftermarket scope
Original owners manual
.223 boresnake core cleaner
Laser bore-sighting tool

I will only do a face to face sale, and will require to see an ID proving that you are of legal age to own this.  Also, I will write up a simple bill of sale and both parties will sign.

I personally like this look much better than the newer ones with the black controls. To each their own, however.  EXCELLENT condition. Hogue grips and the guide rod and recoil spring have been updated and a recoil buffer added. Again, just my opinion but I think these are one of the sexiest looking pistols ever made."

28 inch (I think) barrel with ventilated rib.  Has a Full choke (fixed).

Original owner

Has a factory magazine plug (removable) which limits magazine to 2 rounds.  Otherwise I think it holds 4 in the magazine.

Etched name into blueing on both sides of shotgun since I never thought I would ever sell it.  Could remove it with a little sanding (or sandblasting) followed by re-blueing.  Has some camo tape residue on stock after removing the camo tape.  Probably cleans up easily with some light solvent (acetone).  Also has an ID etched in blue which could also be removed with sanding probably before any sale.  May contact remington to get their blueing kit to match.

Currently missing the magazine end cap ($14 with sling swivel hole - sold online).  (It was loaned out and has not come back).

Shoots great and has downed plenty of dove and (trap, skeet, and sporting) clays over the years.  Yes - try skeet with a full choke! lol.

Don't do too much of that these days so I thought I'd see who else may be interested in it.

Glock 27.  It has an almost new factory barrel with only about a box and a half of ammo put through it.  I also have a Lone Wolf barrel for it that has a bit more use but is still in outstanding shape.  It comes with the factory box, 1 original G27 9rd magazine, 1 G27 mag with the +1 pinky extension, 2 G23 mags one of them has the sleeve to make it fit the 27, 1 G22 mag with the sleeve,  a Blackhawk IWB holster, and a Blackhawk SERPA holster.  I am asking $600 for the package or I will take $450 for the pistol minus the Lone Wolf barrel, extra mags and holsters.  Feel free to make a reasonable offer.
