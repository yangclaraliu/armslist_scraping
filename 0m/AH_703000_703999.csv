I'm asking $350, with one 10-round magazine, all the original paperwork, lock, and the Browning pistol case.  

I also have various accessories that I could add to the deal if interested.
- a Tactical Solutions Integral Rail (MSRP $85)
- Williams Firesight (MSRP $25 -- front sight only)
- NcStar scope 2-6x magnification model SC2628B (MSRP $40).


I'll sell these three accessories with the gun for a combined total of $450.  I'm open to selling just the gun with just some of the accessories listed.  The scope, frankly, doesn't have adequate eye relief for easy pistol use, but could be used, or just mounted on to a rifle.  For info on the rail, see:

I got into AK styled rifles and having one AR does not make much sense to me so I am getting out of the AR game so to speak. I would be more than happy to consider a trade for an AK. It could not be a Century build rifle though.

The rifle has had less than 500 rounds through it. It is a Daniel Defense DDM4. It is chambered in 5.56 with a mid-length gas system, and the Omega X rail system.

It comes with the rifle, the original hard case, 5 Magpul magazines, a bore guide, a cleaning kit, and roughly 200 rounds of 5.56.

I am VERY meticulous when it comes to maintenance and it shows. There is not a single mark on the rifle and it looks like it is brand new. The pictures speak for themselves.

NOTE: The Pelican case in the photo is NOT included. ONLY the original. Also, the Magpul mags are not shown."

i have put new pictures up because the Picture with the 6 Mags in it shows where the previous owner painted it camo in the center, i spent about half an hour and took most of it off, it had not been primed so it came off easy with the finish still ok, i also did a quick strip down and reassemble. it looks a lot nicer and mechanics all work fine, about 50 rounds run through it recently. Hope these pictures will help. If I was going to keep it i would pop off the stock and put a folding one on and put a nicer suppressor on it. or it is ready to use now.

This rifle was part of an NRA program back in the 1960's buying surplus Military products (This was the pre-cursor to the Civilian Marksmanship Program).  Since it was purchased, it has never been fired.  A local range rated the cosmetics at 98% and said that there were two very small rust spots in the barrel, but it appears that a cleaning with wire brush would clean them right out.  We ran a bore snake through it and 50% came out. (I haven't run the brush since nothing metallic has ever traveled down the bore)  This would make a nice little collector or even a good shooter if someone wanted.  Email me with any questions"

New in July. About 150 rounds through it. Runs perfect, of course. Comes with three magazines (13 rounds), Trijicon night sights, (new in August), and a TT Gunleather holster (Occidental stamp). Asking $600, postal money order, my guy to your guy, I will get shipping. Not really in a big hurry to sell it, but I saw that SIG makes a 938 in the SAS model. Gotta have it.

On to the info.  12 gauge 2.75"" or 3"" shells. 5 + 1 capacity, 18.5"" barrel, blued. Awesome old school wood grips.  Bought this gun used and it hasn't skipped a beat using it myself.  For folks wanting a round count, I couldn't even estimate the number of rounds downrange killing watermelon, cans, clay, gallon jugs, paint cans, giant 8' stuffed bunnies.  But this thing has NEVER missed a beat.  Just upgraded to a 590 and I'm truly sorry to let it go, but 1 in, 1 out.  More than willing to listen to interesting offers and trades up or down.  Don't want your used old laptop, your old a$$ playstation, your dishes, or anything that won't hold some semblance of value.  I will meet you for the right trade.  No dirtbags (according to my entirely subjective judgement), no felons, I want to see ID, you can see mine, etc etc etc.  C'mon, it's an awesome gun that needs a new home!"

See if you can answer these questions - which every American who loves his country should be able to answer:
1. When and where was the American Revolution won, according to John Adams?
2. When and where did the Revolutionary War break out?
3. What caused the British Regulars, the most well-trained, well-disciplined army in the world, to break and run at Concord's North Bridge, after only two minutes of musket fire by shopkeepers and farmers?
4. What caused this reversal of British military opinion:

BEFORE April 19, 1775:
""Americans are raw, undisciplined and cowardly"". John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich and 1st Lord of the Admiralty 

""With a thousand British grenadiers I would undertake to go from one end of America to the other and geld all the males, partly by force and partly with a little coaxing"". Major General Alured Clarke 

AFTER April 19, 1775:
""Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself very much mistaken. They have men amongst them who know very well what they are about..."" Lieutenant-General Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland

Join us on January 12-13, 2013 for the Appleseed Rifle Marksmanship Clinic at Buds Gun Shop, 1105 Industry Road, Lexington, KY  40505 and find out the answers to these basic questions about our country's founding.

673,http://www.armslist.com/posts/703673,For Sale:  Custom Colt 1911 45ACP Acc-U-Rails Novak Tritium Sites Etc,"North, Syracuse, New York","$ 1,500","Listed On: Friday, December 7, 2012",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action,no type,"Here for sale is a Colt Model 1911 Semi automatic pistol. It started life as one of a thousand special edition Delta Elites that Colt put out in the early ’90s called a ‘Match 10’. These had a Gold Cup lower mated to a government model Delta Elite slide. Serial numbers were MTEN000 – MTEN999.  It was given Novak Tritium night sites and setup for concealed carry. Due to its weight it was seldom carried. 
As the gun was just sitting around a gun smith friend of mine asked if I was interested in having the Match 10 converted to a 460 Roland.  He was interested in trying the new cartridge with a 10mm slide/frame as it was a lot stronger than a stock 45 slide/frame and should not need the compensator the 460 required to keep from beating up the frame of a stock 45 1911. Anyway that meant refacing the slide to fit the 45 ACP case. So now my ‘Match 10’ was rebarreled and chambered in 460 Roland. Yes it worked well at dropping deer like the hammer of Thor but the accuracy was not where the 10mm had been so I had Acc-u-rails installed on the gun which tightened up the groups to excellent and made it much softer to shoot. 
But again due to the weight of the 1911, and now how powerful it shot, I put it away for the last 10 years. Now, in an effort to make the gun both more pleasant to shoot, cheaper to shoot, and sellable, I had a new barrel fit to it in 45 ACP, re-blue it and generally put it back to an ‘As New’ condition Custom Colt 45 1911. 
So here for your consideration is a Delta Elite slide which was factory fitted to a Gold Cup lower, later mated together with Acc-u-rails, further customized with serrations on the front of the slide, Novak night sights, S&A mag well, S&A Ambi Mag release, Brown BeaverTail, Brown Safety, McCormick  Trigger, Pachmayr thumb slide guard, Wilson hammer/sear set and a Wolff Spring Kit throughout. And then re-blued to make all parts match perfectly. 
I am asking $1,500 or a reasonable offer. 
As a high volume competition pistol it should shoot 45ACP forever and never shoot loose. I still have the 460 barrel and bushing which I will include along with the proper spring recommendations, if you are interested."

Comes with 3 different interchangeable adapter heads to accommodate; 900 µm buffered fiber, ribbon or 250µm coated fiber and 3mm jacketed fiber. text/call 316 308 six800. thanks


The Wilcom Model F6222 Telecom Optical Fiber Identifier is a rugged, easy-to-use installation and maintenance instrument which identifies optical fibers by detecting the optical signals being transmitted through a fiber. By utilizing local detection technology (non-destructive macro-bend detection which does not damage or overstress the fiber), this units eliminates the need to open the fiber at the splice point for identification; eliminating the probability of interrupting service. 

This Optical Fiber Identifier detects low frequency tones at 270 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz. When traffic is present on the fiber under test, an audible tone can be heard as well as the traffic direction which is indicated by LEDs illuminating on the probe. 

During installations, maintenance, rerouting, or restorations it is often necessary to isolate a specific fiber without disrupting service. A light source such as Wilcom's Model FS1316 used in conjunction with the Optical Fiber Identifiers can make the job a lot easier.

""The Semi-Auto Sniper System is designed to provide marksmen a weapon that could accomplish both their long range precision mission and provide rapid defensive fire when needed.""

I'd prefer an 18"" barrel, though 20"" is also fine. A 16"" barrel seems like it would be too short for the accuracy I'm looking for.

It would be great if the weapon had a good trigger system that does not create inaccuracy problems. 

Possible models include the Savage BAT Tactical, DPMS LRT-Sass, an FNH-Scar, a Sig 716, or something similar.

If bi-pod, sight and ammo are part of the deal and the price isn't right, we can talk. Cash deal preferred.

It comes with the sling, the bayonet, the 5 or 10 round factory clip, an after market 30 round clip, and 40 rounds, everything in the pictures below.

We kicked GOD and Prayer out of our schools many years ago, so how could we ask GOD to protect our kids in school? May GOD have Mercy on us and our souls...
A Gun did not Murder those innocent Children and Teachers, an insane, young, GODless man just happened to used a gun to do the Murdering.
If we bring GOD and Prayer back to our Homes, and our schools and our Lives, and we Teach our kids to Honour, Trust and OBEY GOD and HIS Commandments, and Prayer and HIS Love, Mercy and Grace, just maybe GOD will protect us from ourselves and each other...

 * Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
 * The bolt of the VZ 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
 * The VZ 58 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
 * The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ 58.
 * The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ 58.
 * The VZ 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. 
* The alloy magazine of the VZ 58 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lb. vs. .84 lb.)
 * VZ 58 is easier to field strip.
 * The VZ 58 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47.

I work in the 3rd ward until 5 pm every day and live a couple blocks away. 

Have cash on hand and wont waste your time. 

Thanks very much"

I'm not looking for .40/.45 any other caliber.  I'm only interested in the Mk25 9MM.  I will pay reasonable price for it.  The email comes directly to my phone so I can check it almost immediately.  If the price was good enough I would consider other 226/9mm Models but I'm primarily interested in the Mk25. 

Academy Sports & Outdoors sells the Mk25 for $949 + tax so this ad will remain up until I find one or can get one cheap enough.  My price is negotiable but I'm not interested in paying an individual as much as I would a company and uncle sam."
