Dear Travis,

Make no mistake about it, right now Governor Mark Dayton and Barack Obama are on a war path to take away your right to keep and bear arms in Minnesota.

You've heard their threats for weeks -- but now the St. Paul gun-grabbers are acting.

And they're even bringing out the Washington bullies and some ""pro-gun"" turncoats to help exploit tragedies and trample your Second Amendment rights. 

When I saw what lawmakers crammed into their most recent bill -- H.F. 241 -- my jaw hit the floor...

Authored by anti-gun St. Paul State Representative Alice Hausman, H.F. 241 would:

*** Ban the sale, transfer, possession and manufacturing of ALL semiautomatic firearms with a detachable magazine and at least one ""characteristic"" -- which means just about anything that makes a gun ""look scary.""

(This includes rifles AND pistols!)

*** Impose sweeping bans on pistols, rifles and shotguns that have ""the capacity to accept"" more than 7 rounds of ammunition;

*** Force current owners of ALL ""grandfathered"" weapons to undergo intrusive, redundant, ANNUAL background checks at their own expense;


*** Force owners of ALL ""grandfathered"" weapons to obtain permission to keep their guns by registering them annually with law enforcement;

*** Force the confiscation of thousands of firearms to law enforcement. Failure to comply could result in a $25,000 fine, five years in jail or both;

*** Give local law enforcement a blank check to make up their own gun storage rules as they please, and;

*** Give local law enforcement agencies vast new powers to bust down your door to make sure you are in compliance with all of their new, made up, ""rules.""


That's right. This bill forces you to open up your door and let the police ""inspect"" your legally possessed firearm as they please. 

Now this isn't surprising. 

After all, Governor Dayton vetoed a bill last year that would have prohibited him from confiscating your weapons in a state of emergency. 

Now, he is declaring that preverbal emergency by further cracking down on your right to keep and bear arms.

And with the first DFL majority in two decades, anti-gunners like Governor Dayton, Mayor R.T. Rybak, and State Rep. Hausman are going full speed ahead.

They've even recruited President Obama to kick off their gun-grab with a visit on Monday, who's anti-gun agenda has all but earned him the blessing of the ""Republican"" Sheriff of Hennepin County, Rich Stanek.

Worse, they're going to try to ram this through the House Public Safety committee beginning next Tuesday, February 5th at 10:00 AM. 

But... There is some good news. 

YOU can help put a stop to this nonsense. 

Here are three things you can do right now:

1.) Contact the members of the House Public Safety Finance and Policy committee. 

Urge them to reject H.F. 241 and all gun control immediately.

Do not wait. Please act today. 

For Freedom, 

Dudley Brown
Executive Vice President 

P.S. Governor Dayton and the DFL aren't holding back on imposing gun control in Minnesota. 

H.F. 241 not only would ban hundreds of commonly possessed firearms, it would give the government sweeping new powers to bust down your door to ""inspect"" your lawfully possessed firearms at their leisure. 

Contact YOUR State Representative at REDACTED or by clicking here. 

Urge them to reject H.F. 241 and ALL gun control throughout the legislative session."

I have the original case the pistol came in, all the original paperwork, plus three (possibly 4) 1911 magazines. These include one colt, two kimber and one generic mag. I also have the original grips the defender came with. Also, I have a nice (double?) mag belt clip. I will also include a custom molded LH Kydex holster as well as a soft material transport holster. This is a complete and all inclusive package for the discerning 1911 collector. This was my office gun and I absolutely love it, but like all things I eventually rire of my pieces and am now ready for a new toy. All told, there's easily $2,000 worth of hardware here. 

I'm not looking to sell this pistol, I'm looking for interesting things that go bang. I'd trade for a high end AR-15, an OBR, a nice carbine (we're not talking hi-points lol), or an AK47 or variant (no crappy stamped ones though). I'd also consider an AK or AR pistol, but not one of the junk variants. I'm also open to SBRs (short barrel rifles). I might also consider some super cool shotgun (Saiga 12, serbu shorty etc). One thing I don't have is a high end sniper rifle. If you have one kited out with scope, bipod etc, that would be of interest to me. I have most every pistol there is, but if you have something extra special, it can't hurt to mention it.

I'm in no rush to get rid of this piece, nor do I have any motivation to do so other than (as I said) an interesting trade. Let me know what you have, and maybe we can come to an agreement. I'm not really interested in adding any cash to the deal unless you have something like a KRISS carbine in which case obviously I'd add a little extra cash. If you're looking for an entry level 1911 this isn't the pistol for you."

If you don't know about these guns they were the first mass produced rifle that had a stock that wasn't wood.  The receiver and stock are both made of Nylon Zytel-101.  It is semi automatic tube fed where you load the rounds in through the butt of the gun and it's even self lubricating.  This rifles are known to be insanely reliable in any weather conditions and Remington even put a lifetime warranty on all the nylon material from cracking, breaking or even fading because back in those days if it wasn't wood people didn't trust it.  There is a period correct scope mounted on it right now that is a bit dusty.  The Nylon 66 is known to be very accurate with just the iron sights and even was famous for attaining the aerial shooting record.  It's in good shape with a few scratches that you could buff out if that's what you wanted.  It has just sat inside the house and I'm not even sure how long it's been since my dad has fired it and it looks like it's barely even been used.

337,http://www.armslist.com/posts/980337,For Sale:  	 Adams & Deane Self Cocking 54-Bore Pistol / Hand guns For sale,"Texas, Sandusky, Ohio",$ 500,"Listed On: Saturday, February 2, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a very early Adams patented self cocking or ""automatic"" revolver in 54 bore. The serial number is under 1000 and pre-dates the investment into Adams by a merchant bank. This is a significant revolver as it does not have a rammer but used spiked bullets pressed into a wad. This proved unsatisfactory as bullets could drop out of the cylinder much to the embarrassment (or demise) of the owner. Subsequently rammers were fitted as standard or often as a retrofit to earlier models. This revolver has not been touched.

The Adams revolver was a very significant development in British Firearms History and nice examples are scarce. Ultimately it was the quality of Adams' work and his contemporaries such as Tranter and Webley that lead to the demise of Colonel Colt's manufacturing aspirations in the United Kingdom.
The revolver has good mechanics and cocks, rotates and looks without problem and is tight. There is over 50% of the original finish remaining and even some case hardening evident. As can be seen the grips are very good and indicative of the quality of the revolver, there is a percussion cap compartment in the butt.
The full Adams & Deane address is engraved and nicely visible along the top strap and there is strong rifling in the bore.
Other than transitional revolvers this would have been about the first serious competition to Colt who was emerging with great success at this time.
A very pleasing revolver"

Additional Description: The DPMS Panther A3 Lite 16 could be the perfect semi automatic AR-15 rifle. A 16"" lightweight barrel, 30 round detachable magazine and the fabulous DPMS Pardus collapsible buttstock are just some of the highlights of this black anodized beauty. Whether you are buying your first AR-15 rifle, or need a simple and effective carbine, the DPMS A3 Lite 16 is for you. This carbine earns its name with its 16"" light profile barrel, A3 style flat top upper receiver, and 6-position collapsible stock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.5 lbs. The simple A3 upper receiver, with its built-in picatinny rail, allows for the addition of almost any sighting optic you can imagine. The 16"" barrel although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. And the collapsible stock makes this carbine very handy and compact.

I have no need nor am I in any kind of hurry to sell.

My cash sale price is $900 firm. (please refrain from emailing me with a lower offer, I will sell at the listed price if you want to buy it for cash, but I am primarily looking to trade for something else)

Only considering sale because it used to be my carry gun, but I have moved to carrying my XD-S instead.

The gun is a Para Ordnance Warthog, black finish, white dot rear sight and red fiber optic front sight. I am the second owner, purchased used at a gun shop, and have had it for about two years. Gun has had a professional trigger job performed when the fiber optic sight was installed, was done about a year ago, still have the receipt for the work performed, cost me $256.33, not counting the shipping costs. Trigger on the gun is excellent, almost zero take-up, crisp 4# break, and almost zero overtravel. Gun includes the factory plastic case, 2 ten round magazines and 1 thirteen round magazine with grip extension. The only negative on this gun is that because it has been carried there are light scratches and finish wear on the slide. The frame is in excellent condition, and a simple refinish of duracoat or cerakote on the slide would make the gun look brand new again (if the gun doesn't get sold or traded I will be doing that myself).

Between the cost of the gun and the trigger job and sight install I have just over $1000 wrapped up in this gun. I took into account what I have into the gun and what it would cost to have the slide refinished when determining my price/trade value."

Additional Info: I am the original owner, I've had it since early October. Took it to the range 3 times, put around 700 rds through it total. Cleaned receiver/bolt thoroughly after every trip, and I run a boresnake through the barrel as well. For that reason, the barrel has some gunk in it and could use a thorough cleaning with rod/brush/patches, I just liked the boresnake because it's quick and easy and seems to work well enough (never had a single issue in 700 rds). The factory rear sight snapped off, so I bought another from ruger and paid a local gunsmith to install it (it's very simple to tap it in but I just don't have the tools), and there are a couple minor nicks on the barrel from when he tapped it in. I have the rear sight a little bit adjusted to the left, but with the 50 rds I am including you should be able to zero it in however you want it. Like I said I've never had any issues with this rifle, it is accurate and most of all very fun to shoot."

Additional info: I am the original owner, I have had this weapon since July and have put around 1200 rds through it (usually ~200 rds per range trip). Never had any stoppages, but the only ammo I have used is 230gr FMJ from Winchester, Federal, and PPU (the typical Walmart stuff). Gun itself is in great shape, a couple very minor marks on it from normal use that you probably wouldn't notice unless I showed you. I clean it after every trip to the range so it has been looked after. The ammo included is 150 rds of PPU and 146 rds of Winchester, both 230gr FMJ. Beautiful gun, feels great to hold and shoot, completely reliable and accurate. This is also one of the rarer Springfield Loaded models that were made in the U.S. rather than Brazil. You can tell because of the Geneseo, IL stamp above the serial number, instead of the IMBEL, BRAZIL that you would find on most models below the Operator."

If you don't know what a ""PISTON DRIVEN AR"" is....you need to do your homework.

REVIEWS BY ADVANCED WEAPONS:
First field test of the SR556- Sheridan, Wyoming. Ruger factory sponsored prairie dog hunt. We were privileged to attend the hunt, and an Impact employee was the first to take an animal with the SR556 rifle!

Function and reliability were 100%. The dog town we were shooting at had dogs out to 360 yards. All ranging was done using the new Ziess 8x binoculars with range and holdover function. Even with a low 10x scope, dogs were taken all the way out to 361 yards. Very impressive for any rifle, and even more so for a carbine!

We were shooting Hornady TAP ammo, 55g, loaded into the P-Mags that are included with each rifle. Effect on the targets was devastating. Multiple hits and complex gymnastics by the dogs were the norm.

All in all, our experience with the SR556 was beyond our expectations. The gas system gives the gun a softer recoil that a standard gas AR, and the chamber/bolt area was much cleaner that a gas AR. This SR556 is a keeper, and a really good value with all the good kit that is part of the base rifle.

We have sold literally hunderds of the Ruger SR556 rifles. They are incredibly reliable and several of our customers report that even after thousands of rounds (some without cleaning) they have not experienced a single malfunction! 

If you don't know what a ""PISTON DRIVEN AR"" is....you need to do your homework.
Piston AR's are more Reliable, Cleaner and Smoother Shooting!

 The gunmaker tested the MK23′s recoil system with over 30k rounds of +P ammunition followed by 6k high pressure proof rounds. After disassembling the gun the Germans found no damage or excessive wear to any of the components.

 And then they did some more tests . . .

 The ballistic boffins froze the USP to −42 °C (−43.5 °F), fired it and then frozen it again. They heated it to 67 °C (152.6 °F) and fired it. They cycled between these extremes several times. They subjected USP to standard NATO mud and rain abuse. They immersed it in water and sprayed it with sea water. They dropped it from six feet, hammer first, onto a steel-backed concrete slab.

 H&K deliberately lodged a bullet in the barrel and then sent another one down the pipe. The second bullet cleared the obstruction producing only a minor bulge in the barrel. They loaded a full magazine and then fired the gun again with the bulging barrel. The resulting group measured less than 4 inches of deviation at 25 meters – a standard that  new guns would be lucky to hold but 90% do not.

 In short, Heckler & Koch , The selected gun by the US Seal Teams."

Ultra-reliable. Ultra-lightweight. It's no wonder the 85s are our most popular family. We pack them with a combination of customer-requested features and pair them with the .38 Special +P ammo making them powerful, easy to carry and lightning-quick to use. To many of our friends in Law Enforcement, these are must-have revolvers. Taurus Security System (TSS)rs Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. Transfer Bar The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear."

I'm going to be in the Madison area (Verona) between the 18th and 22nd this month (I'm in the Twin Cities) and figured I'd see if anyone was interested in a trade.  My TC posting is below.   Thanks for your time.

****************************************************************

I have a Gen 3 Glock 26 (compact 9MM) with about 200 - 300 rounds through it. VERY well cared for. It will come with FOUR 12 round GLOCK mags (NOT the 10 round Glock mags with aftermarket 2 shot extensions) and TWO GLOCK 10 round mags.  I still have the case and the original paperwork too. It will also come with a stainless steel guide rod (that's an upgrade from the plastic stock rod).

This is a well cared for pistol. I've gone so far as to polish some of the moving surfaces for a smoother action and less friction when feeding/firing. This pistol has never failed me.

I can send pic's for those truly interested. I'm looking for a trade only, no cash. The only other thing I would consider besides a G17 Gen 3 is gold. If trading gold for guns then we can maybe talk about me adding a box or two of ammo.

If you're looking for a 26 this could be your only chance for awhile. Glock is at least 10 months behind in back orders due to current events and the re-elected Marxist."

 This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.Ambidextrous 3-Position Safety
