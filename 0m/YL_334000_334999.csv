This 642 revolver is in perfect working order and very good cosmetic condition.  It is not NIB (has minor nics), but it is perfect for what you will be using it for.
It's had about 75 rounds through it and was purchased new from Gradys.
I had the opportunity to compare it to 6 other ones in the store and this one had the best fit and cylinder lockup.  This shows at the range...its very accurate for such a small barrel.
This was my wife's, but she ultimately decided on a semi auto instead which we have already purchased.
Uncle Mikes Holster included!
Thanks for your interest..sorry no trades."

After the MKII and MKIII came out, people began to use the term MKI to describe pre-MKII pistols.)

This gun is in 100% pristine condition inside and out. It looks like it shipped from the Sturm-Ruger factory yesterday. It is in the original red cardboard box which is serialized to the gun with the original brown anti-corrosion wax paper and original manual inside. You don't see them in this condition often. Based on the serial number (14-98xx), this one was manufactured in 1977.

While I personally wouldn't fire the gun and put any wear on it, I have 300+ rounds of Federal JHP .22 ammo and a new production spare factory magazine that will go with the gun.

Rather than sell for cash, I'd much rather prefer to trade for a very basic AK-47. I'd be happy with a Romanian WASR-10 or something similar for a project build. Condition doesn't matter as long as it is free of corrosion and is a stamped receiver with a fixed stock (standard rear stock trunion)."

The original full wood stock (looks like tiger oak, but I don't know what kind of wood it actually is) was cut down to match the 16 1/2"" barrel capped with a custom made flash hider. Years after this was built I was thrilled to read articles in AMERICAN RIFLEMAN whenever a gun company would attempt to market a SCOUT. I think May 2011 was the last one I saw when RUGER came out with their version in .308 for around $1000. I doubt you'll see another like this, BUT I CAN'T DO PHOTOS.Ohio residents only, no shipping, $500 CASH. My SCOUT is iron sites only by choice.

I have the whole Ruger kit along with 115 .380 Auto Home Defense Rounds and I can also throw in a Keltec Retention Roto Paddle Holster.

I have a mid-late 70's Winchester Model 94 .30-30. Serial # 44xxxxx.

I took it to the range and fired 10 rounds through it. It shoots straight and cycles good. I just realized I'm not a ""lever action guy"". They look cool on the wall, and in the gun cabinet, but just not my thing when it comes down to shooting them.

Its in great overall condition. The bore and loading gate and ramp are as if it were never even shot by the previous owner.

I don't know NRA gradings and whatnot, but I would say this gun is in the upper 80% condition. When I got it, I just cleaned it up a bit.

The wood has no cracks, no bad scratches..just typical stuff for a gun this old. The action is good, smooth and as good as the day it was made. There is no rust on the gun, and the blueing is in good shape, with only one or two of the corners of the receiver having any wear.

I see more than a dozen of these on gun-broker with INSANE higher starting prices. So if I'm asking too much, let me know.. I'll work with ya.

Email or  call me anytime- leave a voice-mail if I don't answer...I'm either sleeping odd hours, working or going to school. Please do not text me. I had a guy seriously try to buy a car from me via freaking text message....grinds my gears!

Note- I am also including the 10 rounds that I have left of Winchester Power-Point Super X 180 grain, for whatever that's worth in the deal.

Also, the gun holds 7 rounds. I was told by a friend that some of them hold 5, and wanted to make sure to point that out. 

Thanks,
Steve

Its in near perfect condition and I have only ran 75 rounds through it. 

looking for a GEN3 Glock 23/27 would much rather have the 27 but will settle for the 23. I am also willing to put up a small amount of cash up to $100 depending on the condition of your Glock and what you have to give with it. Keep in mind I can get a new GEN3 for $475 from a local seller that also has a posting on here.  I just dont really have a use for the LCR thought it would be cool to have a wheel gun but Im not really into it."

The Hornady® 223 Rem 60 gr. TAP Urban® offers high velocity in 14.5"" or longer barreled weapons. It is the lightest grain weight that Hornady® recommends for 14.5"" barreled firearms with NATO chambers, and the heaviest weight acceptable for 1-12"" twist weapons. The 60 gr. bullet offers performance similar to that of other polymer tipped Hornady® 223 bullets, but with slightly higher retained weight and deeper, more consistent penetration. This bullet’s barrier performance is very similar to that of the 55 grain TAP Urban®, but slightly enhanced.

Intended for use in a 1-7""-1-12"" twist barrel. 
Performs optimally in a 1-9""-1-12"" twist.

The BDL is an upgraded model and includes a high gloss checkered walnut stock with a black fore end tip and black cap on the BDL pistol grip, rich deep bluing for beauty and protection, and hinged floor plate so you can unload the rifle with ease. The hinged plate is nice when its bitter cold and you are trying to unload the gun in the dark, Safer too. (The ADL models do not have this floor plate and you must run your loaded ammo through the chamber to extract. I don’t like that!)

Fun to shoot and very accurate!

See Chuck Hawks review of Remington Model 700 Rifles: http://www.chuckhawks.com/rem_700.htm. Do your own internet research on Remington model 700 in the 30-06 caliber. It gets a lot of great reviews. One of the quotes I often read was “it is one of the most accurate out of the box rifles”.

I emailed Remington with the serial number, 94XXX. They responded that this gun was made in 1964, and this is the only information they have on it.

This was my father’s gun. He bought it new. He lived in the high Sierra mountains in California and deer hunted with it (and did very well!). Other then actual shots on deer, he shot 5 rounds or less each season to make sure it was sighted in. He was from the old school and was a firm believer that if he could not place his shots with iron sights, he should not take a shot. He never used a scope! When I was much younger, I did try deer hunting one year using this rifle, but did not get a shot off. I am a revolver guy now and I do not hunt anymore, so I do not need this 30-06.

Excellent condition. Email me if you want to see more pictures.

First ""I'll take it"" gets it. If no interest, off it goes to Gunbroker or ?.

She is literally brand new, less than one magazine shot threw her, only 10 rounds or so... WOW!

I call her my “Pocket Glock” or “Baby Bam Bam“ since she is Glock’s smallest pistol.  I mean she is so compact in size, and so light in weight, I qualify the term “pocket Glock”!

This Model 26 the perfect tooth for carrying in a good pocket holster. While it will ride comfortably in a pocket, it is even better suited to concealed carry in a good belt holster.

The Model 26 weighs in at about 21.5 ounces empty, is about six and one-half inches in length and four inches high. In overall size, it is about the same as a pocket .38 Special revolver, but offers over twice the loaded ammunition capacity. This 26 holds ten shots of 9mm ammo in its magazine, for a loaded capacity of eleven.

Like all Glock pistols, my Baby is as reliable as a mechanical device can be. She is flawless and as far as reliability, everything you will ever want in a defensive pistol. The Glock is one of the very few pistols that I would grab and rely upon without extensive testing. 

These type of guns have an enviable track record, especially the 9mm Glocks. Oh, and trust me, she is an easy pistol to learn to shoot well... The trigger pull is relatively easy to learn, and there are no external safeties to manipulate.... To fire this little bitch, you simply pull the trigger.  Honestly, if I was going to Mars and there were hostiles, I would be grabbing a Glock and an AK... think about it.  Both work through mud, sleet, snow... you name it,


The Glock is also easy to disassemble and reassemble for maintenance, without the use of tools.

The 26 shown here is exactly how I like my coffee... strong and all black! 

This 26 comes in a hard case, with two magazines, a magazine loader, which is a welcome tool when trying to fully load the magazine, and is oiled up with the best custom gun oil on the market ZOMBIE BLOOD. The frame is contoured and textured for a good hold, even with wet hands or while wearing gloves.

Actually guys, get this.  She will take any of the Glock 9mm line mags... 10,12, 17, or even the 33 round mag will fit this firearm!!  Simply stating any mag that will fit any Glock 9mm will fit this firearm

Many folks look with disdain upon the 9mm as a defensive cartridge. As a retired Chicago Police officer and range instructor, I do not... 98% of the world carry a 9mm in there military services?   

I often carry a 9mm auto pistol.  As with any handgun in a fight, you should shoot quickly and shoot often, and make sure that the bullets land where intended. Eleven 9mm hollow points will pretty much solve any social situation that can be solved with a handgun.

The shooting world is now flush with small 9mm auto pistols. The Glock is not the smallest nor the lightest available, but it is built to last. Additionally, she is just as strong and just as durable as the full size Glocks.

Glock now has something like around thirty different models, but the Model 26 remains my favorites. It is not the newest, the fanciest, nor the most powerful, but it is one of the handiest and most useful Glock models available, especially for concealed carry.

I am a retired Chicago Police firearms instructor with seven years experience on the range as a Lead Instructor. I am listing this firearm as a Private sale however, I have no problem shipping to any FFL of your choice. Make sure he will take a private sale. If he won’t find another FFL... There are plenty listed on through a google search who will except a private sales in your area.

Tell the FFL I will include a copy of my Drivers License., A photo of my Police retired ID and a copy of my Illinois FOID card.

Buy with confidence, and feel free to ask for feedback as I can give a slew of references... always 100% seller feedback.

I will only ship UPS Ground to the lower 48 states, 

Good luck to the luck and thanks for looking

In the next few days I will be posting individually, with pics, several guns for a friend.

Here's the deal; he is an older fellow who just wants a fair price and a good home for his prized possessions. I understand to the buyer they are just new old toys, but to the seller, they are memories and the fact he is selling is a bit traumatic. I understand that and am honoring his request to me that they go where they will be appreciated.

Here's the list of what remains:


Winchester M12, 12 gauge, 1955. Cutts Compensator installed at the time - 1955. Includes a Lyman 725 choke, and a Cutts-Lyman Adjustable choke. Lots of birds taken with this gun. Roughly 60% finish. REDUCED to $375

S&W M&P .38 Special. 4"" barrel. Grips numbered to butt serial # and cylinder; appears quite righteous and correct. 1946-54 vintage. I'd grade the finish at 95%; some thinning on highspots, muzzle but nothing serious or detracting. Reduced to $600

Ruger SP101 in .357. Stainless, Hogue grips, 3 1/4"" bbl. 98%. Slight carry wear - minor surface scratches - can send pics. Reduced to $450

Ammo. 9mm, PMP 115gr FMJ, unopened boxes. 500 rounds. Reduced to $100, all or none.

I have no boxes for any of these.

I am happy to entertain respectful offers. You can't insult me as these are not mine, but opportunistic, greedy and unfair offers will do you no favors. I am doing this without compensation to me, just as a favor, and I don't need silly offers or for you to jerk me around.

I do encourage you to send me information that would help with values or collector interest, especially the Winchesters and Smith & Wesson M&P.

I will be posting pics over the next week, but respectful, serious inquires go to the front of the line.

No felons, crooks, wifebeaters or illegal aliens. If you say ""I'll take it"" and then don't show up, I will post your cell number and email address so other sellers will see it.

This is a very cool little revolver I found at a yard sale and have decided to sell.

This is a H&R .38 S&W black powder catridge (NOT .38 Special) break top 5 shot police pocket revolver. It is a copy of the Smith and Wesson 5 shot revolver of the period. It is extremely rare to see one in .38 instead of .32. Only 10,000 made of this model.

It is in 65-70% original condition with the original nickel plated finish and original hard rubber grips. Amazing for over 100 years old.

It's last patent date is 1896, but the serial number dates it to 1903. So, technically it is considered a modern firearm. It is not registered to anyone and a Red Ryder BB gun is more of a menace to society.

This is the same model revolver that was used in the attempted assassination of Teddy Roosevelt!!!

The sights are basically microscopic and don't really have a purpose. And the grips were made for someone with really small hands. Max effective range of 10 feet.

It is missing all of the internal parts that hold the hammer back, and advance the cylinder. The trigger swings free, and the main spring is present. The missing parts are about $50 online.

It will fire in its current condition, but I don't recommend it without the guts installed. Excellent display piece in its current condition.

I WILL SHIP ANYWHERE IN THE USA- NO FFL TRANSFER NECESSARY. Shipping is $15 with full insurance and tracking

Chances are you're carrying a firearm, but it's always a good idea to carry a secondary, non-lethal form of self-defense in case you find yourself in a situation where a firearm is not appropriate, but you still need to defend yourself.

Stun guns use high voltage and low amperage to temporarily disable an attacker for several minutes. The stun gun does not rely on pain for results. The energy stored in the gun is dumped into the attacker's muscles causing them to do a great deal of work rapidly.

Please check your local statutes regarding stun gun laws in your area. If you're in Wisconsin, I will need to see your CCW permit as well as a valid driver license or ID card.

Please email me with any questions you may have.

Up for sale is a like new AR-10A2 Battle Rifle in 7.62NATO (.308 Winchester).  The rifle is packaged with a Trijicon ACOG TA01NSN 4x32 scope. The rifle and scope are both about a month old.  I have had two range visits with it with impressive results.  Groups were consistently 1 to 1.5 MOA at 100 meters with 168 Grain Federal Sierra Match King BTHP.   Less than 100 total rounds fired.  The firearm is clean and immaculate.  I am selling to fund other firearms builds and projects for the summer shooting season.   My price is well below what a new rifle and scope would run from a dealer and extremely fair.  Please no offers that are insulting or lowball.  I am not in a hurry to sell.
