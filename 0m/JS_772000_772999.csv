I don't particularly WANT to get rid of this rifle, but the current frenzy has driven the price up so much that I could probably live without it if I got the right price.  This has only had about 300 rounds fired through it.  It was upgraded with a US Palm pistol grip with custom stippling and a mock silencer in place of the original muzzle brake (original part available).  They truly don't make them much better than this one, and it is so much fun to shoot.  They're completely sold out everywhere.  I guess everyone is worried they might not be able to get them much longer.  Well, here's your chance.

Widely recognized in the gun world as the best of the best

It has been a decade since we have imported these rifles from Arsenal Co of Bulgaria. This milled receiver rifle sets the standard for superior accuracy and reliability. This modern sporting rifle will easily become the centerpiece of any collection and will be the one handed down from generation to generation.

The quality comes from the original hot hammer forged and milled receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and trigger, the cold hammer forged and chrome lined barrel, and almost 100 years of workmanship and experience.

Its the most desirable color combination, Near mint Condition, Has a few, very very small blemishes here and there from normal use. She runs very strong never had any problems with her at all. Always garaged and stored properly, This bike runs amazing, looks amazing and handles amazing.

Take a ride on the GSX-R600 and you'll quickly become aware of a highly developed sporting tool. On a particular solo run on the Gixxer, the man/machine interface was direct and inspirational, not wanting of a dollop more power or a scintilla of a quicker flick. Its available power is plentiful and the gearbox and slipper clutch works seamlessly at the command of your fingers and toes. The twisty road ahead is consumed to the accompaniment of a beautiful scream from the injected Four. It's difficult to imagine an experience much better.

The coming assault weapons ban will likely NOT affect NY because it will enact nation-wide restrictions that WE ALREADY HAVE. So, this AR is most likely good to go even after the ban!

Anyway, it's a Bushmaster A2 carry handle upper - handguard - 20"" HBAR 5.56 NATO barrel without a flash supressor, a Surplus Arms lower with a DPMS parts kit and pistol grip, and a standard A2 buttstock. Put about 200 rounds through it and it's worked flawlessly; I was striking targets out to 200 yards with the iron sights with ease. In summary, this is a very reliable medium to long range AR that can fire either .223 or 5.56 with no FTE's or FTF's. However, with the prices going up on these I think I am going to go ahead and fish it out there for trade or sale.

The head is a Fender M-80. 160Watts. Built in Chorus. Effects Loop. Peddle. nothing fancy but it gets the job done and then some. I was think of selling the cab for about 350 and the head for about 150. That is pretty much the price I paid for them but I will sell the for less as a package. Hit me up let me know what you could offer. I would also accept a trade for certain firearms. Thanks for your time.

I'm not particularly sure what the issue is but it could be a battery connection problem or it could need to be refurbished by eotech. From what I have been told, if the sight is in warranty, it will be replaced or repaired for free. If it's not, it will cost you $58 to have it completely refurbished. Nonetheless, it still works fine in lower levels of light. Also included is a Vector Optics green laser. This is a very high quality laser and is extremely bright. The laser alone cost me a pretty penny. Also included will be one, 50 round magazine. I will consider partial trades for steel AK magazines, 7.62x39, and perhaps a few other things that I need. Sell will occur in or around the Salisbury area. I will ship the rifle if you are from another state but it will be at your cost. My price is firm.

Gun bans have been proposed, the AWB has been pressured to be renewed. 
High capacity magazine bans are already on the books and more and more are coming!

This may be your last chance!   Stores have been sold out for weeks, and back orders are not being offered anymore.   Nobody has them in stock. 

What I have to offer you is one of two built and tested AR platforms with military spec hardware and DPMS internals.   Both come with A2 butt stocks (longer fixed with extension-remove able) and semi-auto DPMS trigger and hammer.  Stock factory weight springs, but can replace with lower tention sprinds to reduce trigger pull at NO additional cost!

On to the uppers -  One has been identified by the markings by members of ar15.com to be a 1963 Colt A1 upper with triangular hand guards and bird cage flash suppressor.   
Included with this upper is a m16 style heavy bolt carrier control group.  BATFE has stated that the full auto bolt carrier is not an NFA part and IS legal to own. 
This is a very accurate battle rifle with iron sights that requires no batteries, and always goes bang when you pull the trigger.  I can include with this upper a Colt bayonet and scabbard in new condition that can be attached to the end of the rifle. 

The second is a newer M4 style A2 upper with round hand guards.  Again it has iron sights do you know that no matter what happens you will always be on target.     If wanted I can include a 556 calibrated scope that attaches to the carry handle.

Please do not offer me well less than I paid for the rifle - if you can really get one for $1,100 where you are, then by all means, please do, but I paid much more for it than that last year.  Also, if the MSRP of your M4 trade is half the MSRP of this rifle and you believe your rifle has increased in value, would not this rifle have increased equally, a well?

Built on the famous Model 700 cylindrical action, Remington Sendero rifles are the most accurate rifles we produce for over-the-counter sale. You ll be stunned by the degree of precision you get straight out of the box. The varmints won t be so lucky. The Model 700 Sendero SF II are finely tuned tack-drivers created using input from serious shooters across America. The stock is reinforced with aramid fibers and features contoured beavertail fore-end with ambidextrous finger grooves and palm swell. Twin front swivel studs accommodate a sling and a bipod. Full-length aluminum bedding blocks create accuracy-enhancing platforms for the barreled actions. The 26"" heavy-contour barrels are fluted for rapid cooling.

Reliable two-stage piston-driven performance
Troy Industries folding battle sights are adjustable
Quad-rail handguard with rail covers
Six-position, telescoping M4-style buttstock
Three 30-round magazines and soft-sided carry case
Experience the rugged reliability Ruger is renowned for in a new rifle that redefines the AR platform. Its chrome-plated, two-stage, piston-driven operating system offers improved dependability over gas-driven rifles. A four-position, chrome-plated gas regulator allows the shooter to tune the rifle to specific ammunition or conditions. The bolt, bolt carrier and extractor are also chrome-plated to enhance performance and durability. A cold hammer-forged, chrome- lined, mil-spec 41V45 barrel delivers consistent accuracy. Troy Industries folding battle sights are adjustable and co- witness with mil-spec optics so they can easily be removed to make room for high-powered scopes. The Troy Industries quad-rail handguard provides a rigid mount for the piston-driven transfer rod. Rail covers for unused rails make for a more comfortable hold. A six-position, telescoping M4-style buttstock can be used to adjust length of pull. Includes three 30-round MAGPUL PMAG magazines and a soft-sided carry case.

While this weapon is fully functional, be warned that it was designed in a time when shotgun shells were loaded to lower pressures; for the piece's longevity, it is best to fire period-correct 2.5"" shells (available at the links below). This, however, also means that it weighs less than modern guns for quick and easy handling at Cowboy matches.

Also Cablea's is allowing you to back order .223. There is only a 1-2 week wait FYI. If we all can work together and help each others through this time (ammo in stock, what store and location) it will make it easier for all of us to be prepared. I'm not gonna lie I bought 11 box's they had in stock. They still have some for 20+ a box but I am only after the cheaper stuff.

I paid over retail myself for the rifle. I am not very interested in selling the rifle but I thought I might make someone happy if I listed what I was willing to part with it for in the rare chance someone was willing to satisfy my offer. I am more open to trades for another quality rifle and/or handguns (with low round counts or new) plus cash/ammo/magazines. Email me your offers. Low-ball offers will not be dignified with a response. 
  Black 18"" Kel-Tec RFB Chambered in 7.62 NATO/.308. Never been shot. One owner (me) who field striped it once and cycled a few rounds through to test functionality. Comes in original box with sling, bag of screws, owner's manual and one factory metal 20rd magazine. 
  New Black Magpul flip-up sights Gen 2. Currently installed but obviously not sighted in. elevation tool for front sight included along with original packaging. 
  7 Thermold Magazines all brand new.
  750 FMJ ball Lake City loose packaged.
  250+ Silver Bear lead tipped nickel plated steel (leftover from my former FA91 that I sold to fund this rifle). 
Make a cash offer, not really looking to sell for cash only but I do have a willing price I will accept.
Handguns (compact mostly preferred) can be substituted for part of the above cash offer (bonus trade in for magazines and ammo).
Semi-Auto Rifle(s) (lower round count is a must). with magazines/ammo +/- cash is really what I am looking for and am willing to listen to any offer. 
I am not interested in Hunting Rifles/Shotguns (got plenty).    
 CCW permit holders or buyers willing to do a FFL on my dime IF I see fit. Firearm trades I am more than happy to show my CCW permit and I wouldn't feel a need for a FFL transfer in that circumstance. Local Face to Face transactions with legal Colorado residents only."

This firearm is based on the reliable & tough design of the AK 47 but overbuilt with superior materials, methods, & chambered with NATO rounds for better accuracy. Basically, an AK on steroids with the accuracy of an AR.  It's a true Israeli imported weapon made by Israel Military Industries & not to be confused nor compared to the cheaper Golani Galil rifles made by Century Arms. From my research the big ""S"" essentially means this is a pre-1994 ban firearm. It has a folding stock, carry handle, & integrated bipod that also cuts wire. 

I believe this is a very rare firearm. I've seen a few in the .223 version for sale (and I have one, model 392, which I love), but none of them have the accessories that comes with this one.  Included are (4) 25 round magazines, a nice Galil soft case with pockets for the magazines as well as a spare pocket, sling, and the original box. It is in excellent condition. It has been referred to as ""The World's Best Assault Rifle"" & after running 20 rounds through it I'm not sure I want to sell it. $4200 OBO.

   Aluminum free float tube, Armalite brand
   PRI gas buster-type charging handle tactical latch
   PWS muzzle brake

Also comes with an extra ejection port door rod--the one on it was too short when I installed the free float tube, so I used a spacer while wiating for the longer rod to come in.  The spacer worked so well I never went back to the gunsmith to get the longer rod put on.

I never had a problem with this upper--it functions perfect.  No kick due to the PWS brake.  I can hit man-sized silhouettes out to 200 yards easily, all day, with a low power scope.
