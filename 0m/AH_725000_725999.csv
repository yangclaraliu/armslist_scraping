I purchased a Dixie Gun Works - Tennessee Mountain Rifle kit long ago, put it together and used it hunting mule deer here in Colorado.  I just didn't want a Thompson Center Hawken rifle like everyone else.  I splintered the stock getting quickly out of a 4X4 hunting so I had 8” cut off the barrel and Williams adjustable sights installed by a gunsmith making it better for transport and use.  All the furniture and of course the barrel are steel which I rust browned the old fashioned way.  The stock is not stained, I believe I put a little linseed oil on it then waxed it with bowling alley wax trying in the beginning to keep it original until I altered it.  The barrel was 41 ½ inches, 15/16” across the flats and rifling is one turn in 56” making it round ball only.  It has double set triggers as you can see by the pix and percussion cap.  It was made in Japan by Miroku, a very old an respected manufacturer that makes guns for that little known company called Browning.  It shoots very well, accurately and is light in the field.  Kits today cost almost $500 and this is ready to shoot.  I have a bullet mold and lots of round ball to pass along to the first buyer of either of my 50's."

The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens.

Stock is very nice and is tiger stripped, has unit disk but markings are gone. NO IMPORT MARKS, I was told this is a vet bring-back rifle. Bore is very nice (especially for its age), a little frosty/dark, but very strong rifling and there is some shine. No mods ever done to it, the receiver is still in the white (which I believe is correct for the German Gew98's). Rifle headspaces perfectly. I've never shot this one but from what I can tell (and my experience with G98's) it should be an outstanding shooter.

The New DPX Scope Saver (patent pending) found exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, this new addition aces the optics mounted on your long guns inside the space in the door. The Scope Saver protects scoped firearms from adjacent firearms and other contents in the safe, ensuring that time spent sighting-in isn’t wasted. In addition, the space that would be taken up by a scope in a traditional safe is now freed up for another firearm. While other safes will store your guns, no other safe will protect them and keep them ready for you to use like a Browning ProSteel Safe.

AXIS Adjustable Shelving — The Most Versatile Safe Interior Ever Designed. Period.
Browning ProSteel safes lead the industry when it comes to managing safe interior storage. Nowhere is our expertise more evident than with our innovative Axis Adjustable Shelving (patent pending). Unlike shelves in other safes that are either fixed in position or only offer vertical adjustment, Axis shelves can be adjusted, both vertically and horizontally, to accommodate items over a broad range of sizes while working around long guns. All premium Browning ProSteel safes feature the Axis Adjustable Shelving system. Platinum Plus and Gold Series safes come fully loaded with an all shelf interior that can be customized to meet your needs. Check out a Browning ProSteel safe with Axis Adjustable Shelving and imagine the treasures you could fill one with.

If you want me to reply please leave a phone number and I will call you ASAP.

Price increase reflects current offer
 It is for sale to the highest offer I that i receive and will remove the sale on 12/31/12 at midnight, the lowest i'll take for it is $1000.00, if your offer does not meet that then no contact is necessary. I am not desperate to sell and this is one of those items that I do not want to part with unless price is right.
Will sell to Virginia residents only, must have 2 forms of ID, voter registration card and/or concealed carry permit preffered but not necessary. 
No low ballers please, these Sub 2k's are hard to find from any local shops, especially the glock variant which is what this one is. I just checked locally and the three stores I contacted will not even take an order for one and I was told that if a shop will take an order it is roughly an 8 month wait to get a hold of one, and with the talk of gun bans who knows what will happen to those on a waiting list.
 Also open to some trades, AR, AK, crates of ammo etc, no hunting rifles or revolvers will be considered. Posting will be deleted 12/31/12 at midnight and sold to the highest offer."

This is a replica of a Confederate copy of the 1851 Colt .36 Navy revolver originally made by Gunnison & Greer, sort of a double copy.  I've fired it many times, works fine and a heck of a lot of fun to shoot at the range.    Made in Italy for Navy Arms as most were back in 1985 when I probably bought it.  Cased as you can see with all the goodies to go shooting.  I think I have a large bag of .36 ball someplace and you can have the single bullet mold."

Anyone that knows anything about a AK-47 will tell you the Yugoslavia made AK is made a heck of a lot better than the Romanian made AK's. 

Rifle comes with one 30 round mag. I have more if needed. I also have a lot of ammo I'll trade for ammo I can use."

Ruger has verified from the serial number that this pistol shipped from the factory in the first month of production of the Vaquero (April, 1993). This is NOT the New Vaquero. This pistol is the original Vaquero that is capable of safely firing the higher pressure ""Ruger-only"" loads found in the handload manuals. The New Model Vaquero has thinner cylinder walls and cannot accept these loads. What that means is that this Vaquero is capable of loads exceeding .44 magnum balistics.

Condition of this pistol is Very Good to Excellent. The bore is shiny. The pistol has slight wear at the muzzle and end of the ejector housing. The ejector housing also has slight scratches at the bottom, and scratches from the ejector rod cycling. Overall blued finish is 90+%. Slight turn marks on the cylinder. The case hardened finish is more difficult to rate, but appears 80-90+% ( I can't tell if there has been some fading, or if that is the way it came). Disclaimer, I am not an expert at rating firearms, so the condition could be slightly better or worse than I have stated.

There is no box or paperwork with this pistol. As well, the grips are not original, as it shipped from the factory with eagle rosewood grips.

I am firm on the price. I have done my research online as best I could and found pistols of this vintage and condition to go from $600-$700, the higher end are with box and no papers. I have this one set as low as I will take. Pistol will come with a box of Hornady Critical Defense."

Therefore I have decided to sell the most beautiful rifle in my collection. My 1908 Remington model 8 autoloading rifle chambered in .30 Remington also known as 30/30 rimless. John browning originally designed this rifle for deer hunters but it became popular with police and military use. Most notably the famous Texas ranger Frank Hamer carried a model 8 religiously and is credited with gunning down Bonnie and Clyde with his custom model that Remington made for him after learning about his affection for the gun. Many people see a resemblance in this browning designed rifle with one of his most famous, the B.A.R. However I believe it to be much more beautiful rifle. This is a rifle for the serious collector only. It is in exceptional condition with very few signs of wear. Please text me at REDACTED for pictures or call with questions. $450 is what I will take for it, and that's a steal as I see them go for up to $900 in this condition."

I can meet you in Vancouver or Kelso.  Just email me for a time and place.

Positively dated to 1888, this is a Hopkins & Allen Double Action No. 6 .32 pocket revolver.  It uses .32 S&W ammo, which is easy to buy online.  I have tested this revolver with Magtech ammo, and it works just fine.  I'm including 25 rounds of ammo in the deal.  I know this revolver works.  But to cover my you-know-what, since it's an antique gun, I have to tell you that you should have this revolver thoroughly checked over by a certified gunsmith before you attempt to fire it.  Interestingly, because this revolver was manufactured before January 1, 1899 no FFL is required to ship or receive it through the mail.

$165 cash or I will consider swapping for a .22 rifle or a cheap automatic pistol like a Hi-Point."

I can meet you in Vancouver or Kelso.  Just email me for a time and place.

Positively dated to 1888, this is a Hopkins & Allen Double Action No. 6 .32 pocket revolver.  It uses .32 S&W ammo, which is easy to buy online.  I have tested this revolver with Magtech ammo, and it works just fine.  I'm including 25 rounds of ammo in the deal.  I know this revolver works.  But to cover my you-know-what, since it's an antique gun, I have to tell you that you should have this revolver thoroughly checked over by a certified gunsmith before you attempt to fire it.  Interestingly, because this revolver was manufactured before January 1, 1899 no FFL is required to ship or receive it through the mail.

$165 cash or I will consider swapping for a .22 rifle or a cheap automatic pistol like a Hi-Point."

Well maintained Norinco SKS-M manufactured in 1993.
Do you like the accuracy of a SKS but want the capacity of an AK?
If so this gun’s for you.

The SKS-M does not have evil features like “muzzle devices”, “pistol grips”, or a (nothing short of satanic) “folding stock” yet it can accept readily available low or high capacity AK magazines.
Chambered in the ever popular Russian 7.62x39 caliber it is inexpensive to shoot and has a mild recoil.

As everyone wants to get a better price so they can boast about how well they dealt and this particular firearm has some nicks in the stock by the eject port and some miscellaneous shallow scratches elsewhere I will allow myself to be talked into reducing the price by fifty dollars so you can amaze your friends.
The rifle comes with  one 30 round mag.

You must be 21 years old or older, a resident of Wisconsin and have no legal restrictions that ban you from purchasing a firearm.
Wisconsin concealed carry permit trumps all."

This revolver is about as tiny as they come.  This is a Harrington & Richardson Victor 7-shot .22 Short revolver.  Everything looks and works great except that it will accept only six rounds because one hole in the cylinder is a little too tight.  It can probably be fixed.  But, I didn't want to try.  It's a six-shooter as it is.

This revolver would make a nice concealed carry back-up or women's purse gun.  The bright nickel plating makes it look bigger than it really is.

I'm including 100 rounds of Remington ammo in the deal.  $165 cash or I will consider swapping for a .22 rifle or a cheap automatic pistol like a Hi-Point."

Info from LWRC regarding the rifle:
The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

  The rounds are I believe 158 grain, however oddly enough its not listed. They are made my prvi partizan and generally go for about $7/box of 25 (all rounds are in 25 round boxes) I'll go down to $5/box. So $60 takes 600 rounds of .38 special rounds or I would consider trading for .45 ammo or 7.62X39..

This pistol is in fantastic condition and has had somewhere around 300 rounds fired through it. The gun comes with the following items:

Original box, papers, shell casing
1 Ruger 8rd and 1 7 rd magazine
1 Ruger soft case
1 Blackhawk OWB holster (polymer, not a button-release type)

This is a fullsize 1911 with a 5"" barrel. It uses Novak 3-dot sights and the finish is a very tough dull stainless steel grey. Unlike some stainless 1911's where the sides are polished, the finish is even over the entire surface of the gun. The trigger is adjustable for overtravel and I'd guess weighs in around 4lbs. These are extremely hard to find guns because of the features they include at the low price point. It has been great for me, but I've found myself wanting a Sig 4.2"" scorpion instead.

Price is firm, please do not ask what I'll take. I paid $760 for the pistol and it was the only one I've ever actually seen for sale. Plus you're getting an unused holster as well. A fair deal for an excellent gun."

With superior pellet distribution from the core to the outer fringe, shooters benefit from a larger margin of error than ever before. This translates to more X's on score cards for competitors. 

But there is more. Because our choke tubes produce optimal pellet patterns, one Muller Choke Tube does the job of two ""traditional"" tubes. Constriction comparisons are as follows:

U2 = I.C./Light Modified (Lt. Mod)

Other Muller Choke Tube features include: 8 finger grooves for quick and easy choke changes--no more choke wrenches. Guaranteed to be non-corrosive and non-fouling. Carbon and plastic wad build-up are things of the past--use your time to clean your gun, not your choke tubes.

I have not personally shot it, though.  It may need professional service because it does not index properly on one chamber of the magazine, due to wear on the magazine cylinder and/or indexing point (not sure about the technical name for the part).  The finish is not bad, but has wear.  There is a small nick over the trigger (left side) and minor pitting on the barrel (left side).  The bore looks very clean to me, and I have stored the gun in a case, always wiping it well after handling.  This gun also has an aftermarket right-handed grip.  It is a comfortable grip.
The last patent date stamped is July 4, (19)05.  It fires the .38 Long Colt round which are available through specialty ammunition suppliers on the web.  It should not be used with standard .38 Special rounds since they are higher power and may damage the pistol.

I am looking for the following models, and used does not matter, nor does good honest wear. Just not abused, well maintained please- but guns are tools and a few nicks or dings never hurt anyone.

Looking for a Beretta 92fs, Prefer Italian make. Also looking for the Inox model please (Italian for stainless). Looking for the slightly older models that have metal triggers and other parts verses polymer coating. The polymer has a ""flex"" to it that affects my grouping with the pistol.

Ruger LC-9: Never owned this one before, but interested in trying it out.

Sig 938: This is for my wife. She is also a shooter and valid FOID card holder. She has been looking for one of these for awhile. Looking for stainless slide and wood grips, very specific.

Additional Description: Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer. The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil. Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson.  The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern. If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed.

Made for the top-level target matches held at Camp Perry, Colt only produced 2500 of these pistols between the years 1920-1941. Chambered for .22LR, the pistol is built on a Colt Officers Model Match frame, but it is a single shot pistol, the entire “cylinder” swings out for loading. The pistol has a 10 ” barrel with an adjustable rear sight, and the front sight is adjustable as well. As attractive as it is rare, the pistol is finished in Colt’s finest polished Commercial blue, and it has factory wooden checkered grips with silver-colored Colt Medallions. The pistol has a few very light service marks on the receiver and there is a very minute area of freckling on the right side of the receiver. There is also a tiny, but noticeable ding on the butt of the grips, this notwithstanding, these are very minor and overall condition of this beautiful pistol is 95%. The pistol has a shiny bore with strong rifling, and trigger pull is very smooth. This is a Museum-Grade Colt that will be a centerpiece of a fine collection.

Selling my like new S&W Governor.  It shoots .45ACP, .45LC, or .410 shotgun shells.  It has only had 10 rounds through it.  I love the gun and it shoots great, just selling to find another project since I don't shoot it much.

This is like the Taurus Judge but I think it is a little better.  The differences between the Judge are that it holds 6 (judge is 5), it can shoot .45ACP (judge cannot), and I think it has a slightly better build quality (this is subjective and just my opinion)
