To be honest with you I have never held one. I have been looking for a good concealment 9mm and this one is suppose to be one of the best. I could not find one in Oregon and the waiting lists in Portland were long. My local shop had not seen one before. So, I went to the internet and found one, but they were in a package deal. So now I have 2 Walther PPS (both new). I am keeping one of course and selling the other. They should be in Springfield on Tuesday or Wednesday this next week.  They are being shipped to my local gun shop. 

If you want to research it more just enter in Walther PPS 9mm into your search browser. There is a you tube video that compares it with the competition. I was impressed.

Gonna go ahead and toss this up for sale...

This is a 1984 Built Ruger 10/22... Back when they were still built out of quality materials and good quality control.

It is darn near perfect condition... And you'd be hard pressed to find one this old in as good of shape.

Has a Tactical Solutions Scope Rail installed, but has never had a scope installed upon that rail.

I ordered them, and then sold my 15/22.  I am not looking to scalp someone, but I dont want to lose any money.  I would consider trading them in the right deal, maybe for a cheap AR15 lower or other parts, a good rifle case like a pelican, or .223 ammo (as long as the offer isnt crazy- steel case tulammo is not worth $1 per round to me, so dont waste your time if you want that much for it).  I'm looking in the $15 per box trade value area, depending on steel/brass, etc, which would work out to 100 rounds or so per mag.  I would also trade one of these for 2 30 rd ar pmags.  I will ship if needed. I will only accept Paypal if I have to ship. Thanks for looking!"

This has a polymer frame and a 5.5 inch target barrel. Sale includes the gun, two mags, all original paperwork, plastic case and 60 rounds of CCI Mini Mag ammo. This was an impulse buy last summer as the .22 I want was impossible to find even last summer before the panic, and still is. I've run 440 rounds through this gun and have had no failures. This gun is very accurate and shoots great, it's just not the .22 I want. It has 1 flaw, a small scuff on the right side of the barrel (not very visible) where a tool fell on it when it was on my bench after cleaning. I have no complaints about this gun.

$325.00 Firm and a PTP or PTC is required. Local Twin Cities area sale would be preferred. I'm not interested in trades as I only buy new guns.

Will cycle any type of .223 or 5.56X45 brass or steel casing and never jams.
The Classic is a semi-automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate in 5.56 NATO, the Classic features the original Swiss folding stock, as well as a polymer ergonomic forend. The top of the receiver is full-length rails, ambidextrous safety selector, a two-stage trigger, an AR-style protected magazine release on the right side of the receiver and a bolt-release lever on the left side that is big enough to provide a substantial amount of leverage. Closing the bolt - which locks back on an empty magazine - was a breeze with the oversize lever.

This Sub 2000 is in great shape and has had some work done to it. The barrel has been threaded and the front sight has been removed. Rails have been added to the forearm on 3 sides. Carbine comes with a red dot sight that works well.

Bushmaster XM15-ES2 with 20"" Chrome Lined Heavy Barrel
A2 type sights, A2 stock
Appears to be a post '94 ban era rifle.  No flash hider, no bayonet holder under front sight.  This is a genuine Bushmaster, made in Maine.  Not the new Bushmaster.  Very nice quality firearm.
I picked this up a few years ago and only put 20 rounds thru it.  Good shooter. Zero issues.  Does not appear to have much of a round count thru it.
Also included are two 30 round magazines (one original black magazine, and one new grey magazine with green follower, and 20 rounds of ammunition.)

This is a GSG 5PK pistol for sale.  $750 shipped for all included (or $700 shipped minus the stock and grip, which make it an NFA item).

I also have an HK side folding (PDW style) stock, and an HK forend with vertical Grip both items will make the this firearm an NFA item so know your stuff before using them.  The option to buy without these accessories is available but it is not going to be far from this price...

I can email for all pics (since most show up small). The GSG is very much like new with only 200 rounds of .22lr fired (could pass as new). Comes with:

- Case 
- Factory 10 round magazine 
- 3 Factory 22 round magazines NEW IN BOX (These magazines have been going for upwards of $80 and more....)
- All accessories that come with the Factory GSG 5PK (lock, GSG-5 tool, brush, tool, flash hider) I am also including an allen key for the upgraded allen set that was installed
- Factory Screws
- Upgraded HK push pins (and factory screws)
- Upgraded Allen/hex head screws versus their proprietary screw set that strips easily
- HK side folding stock (had to be burrowed out a little on the hole to work with the HK pins)
- HK Vertical Grip


I have done the upgrade screw kit (has original screws), the upgrade to HK pushpins (takes down like an AR15 with push pins instead of screws) and I have the original takedown screws as well. 

Asking price is $750 shipped for the whole package or $700 minus the Stock and grip (which make it an NFA item when installed) I can email the pics in this ad.


PLEASE KNOW THAT USING THE VERTICAL GRIP ATTACHED GRIP AND FOLDING STOCK WILL MAKE THIS AN SBR. Because of this I am willing to sell without those two components (but it won't knock too much cost off, just what I paid for the items). ALL NFA LAWS ARE ON THE BUYER OF THESE PRODUCTS LISTED ABOVE.

I accept Paypal (discrete only, ABSOLUTELY NO MENTION OF GUN-ANYTHING), money order, or cash."

LNIB!!! 5.56x45mm (.223) Caliber!!!

You are bidding on a Limited Edition Sig Sauer Sig SG551 originally brought to you exclusively by West Coast Armory. Completely assembled by Sig Sauer, this rifle is one of just 250 built from new-in-box Swiss SIG SG 551 rifles that were stuck in customs before WCA and SigSauer rescued them and built these limited edition collector's pieces. Learn more at www.sig551.com.

Do not confuse this Sig Sauer SG551 with the latest release by Sig Sauer, the 551-A1. This rifle is comprised of a Swiss made lower with matching serial numbers on the upper and lower receivers. This is truly a collector's piece that has the capability of being your everyday rifle as well. This fine rifle features an adjustable gas operated piston driven long stroke system that is considered the most reliable system made today; it is very accurate and fires from a closed bolt. The trigger mechanism has an ambidextrous safety and fire selector switch that has four settings: ""S""—safe, ""1""—single fire, ""3""—3 round burst and ""20""—fully automatic fire. Note: this rifle is semi-automatic and has a factory guard installed that prohibits the selector from moving to the burst or full-auto positions. The trigger is enclosed in a pivoting trigger guard which can be folded down to the left or right side allowing for unhindered operation with winter gloves.

LIKE NEW IN BOX: SG 551 semi-automatic 5.56 x 45mm NATO Rifle with a 16-inch barrel and side-folding stock. Overall length is 24-inches with the stock folded and 32.5-inches with the stock extended. Weight: 7.5 pounds. Length of pull: 13.4 inches. Beautiful black Swiss Style furniture. This particular rifle is like new-in-box and has been fired less than 50 rounds to verify function. The finish of this rifle is immaculate. The internal parts of this rifle are flawless.

Auction includes everything you see in the photos, including hard case, three 30 round magazines, trigger lock, Certificate of Authenticity from SigSauer.

Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel, and the checkered polymer frame has two interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

This loaded model has extra features from the factory such as a delta lightweight hammer, titanium firing pin, match grade trigger, beveled treatment, lowered and flared ejection port.  You also get the low profile factory night sights which do wonders for home defense.

Also the original case with the factory holster, mag pouch, and two stainless steel 7 round magazines.  I am also including FIVE brand new Wilson Combat 8 round stainless magazines as well which by itself is a $150 value.

As always I am 100% honest in my trades/sales.  This gun is 98% being the fact it has two faint surface scratches probably each being a CM long that you can barely even see in the pictures if at all.  Gunsmith quoted me around $40 to have them removed but it was never a big deal to me.

It is a very nice and very accurate gun. It has had a trigger job (light and crisp), the barrel has been cut and crowned with 11 degree recessed crown. When the gunsmith did the crown he left a ring in the bluing so he reblued the whole barrel and action to match. Barreled action sits inside a Hogue overmoulded stock. The barrel is free floating. I love this rifle but my son has a 30-06 that was handed down from my Grandfather so I can't get rid of the 06. I am trying to consolidate ammo so I would like to trade this rifle for a 30-06 of comprable quality. The scope is not for sale but I would consider trading it if your rifle has one that is of equal quality on it. Rings and bases are included with the rifle. The scope is a new Leupold VX-II 3-9x40 with Leupold alumina flip caps. I also have a couple boxes of ammo that would go with the gun for the right deal. Price for the rifle wit bases and rings, no scope $600.00"

The fire selector rotates all the way to the ""full auto"" postion! No it won't fire fully automatic as there is no Full Auto Sear installed. It has a full railed handguard installed, forward ajustable grip, Red Dot red/green sight and a DSA X-Series stock on it. It comes with 2 extra FAL stocks, 1 extra FAl grip, the original foregips, and 3 x 20 round mags. I'll even throw in 60 rounds of ammo to get you started!This shoots both 7.62x51 NATO and .308 perfectly, it's a nail driver out past 300 meters!!
This is a true Battle Rifle that is currently used by over 90 countries and is called ""The Right Arm of the Free World"" for a reason!! AR15's and AK47's can't hold a candle to this real Battle Rifle..there is just no compairison to the power of a .308 Battle Rifle!! 
Overall the weapon is the same size as an AR15 M4 variant rifle with the stock extended. This is truely a unique FAL! Metric FAL's are way more desired than the ""inch"" pattern one's as mags are more plentiful and cheaper. Metric can take inch mags as well..inch can't! Get it whike it's hot and while you still can! Make me an offer for cash outright or something with a trade i'm looking for and let's make a deal!!!! My price is waayyy cheaper than an AR15 is right now and it's 2x the rifle!!!
FTF sales only, No bad guys, I.D. required for bill of sale!

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)

M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels. 

T-Marked Upper Receiver 

The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission. 

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate 

The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics. 

Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel 

BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber 

One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning. 

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish 

Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base. 

5.56 NATO Chambers 

The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo. 

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases 

Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets. 

Government Barrel Profiles 

Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems. 

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels 

Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.
