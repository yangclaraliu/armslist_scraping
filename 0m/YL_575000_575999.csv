The optic that is mounted is zeroed to the rifle. It does not go with it but I did not want to remove it for pics in the event I want to shoot before the rifle sells. I am willing to sell the optic if the buyer is interested. 

Don't confuse this with a run of the mill off the shelf AR-15/M4. It is a name brand competition quality piece. It has had some trigger work done. It is much nicer than the government issued M4's I use at work. It was manufactured in Windham, Maine prior to Bushmaster being sold to a larger company.

10 gallon stainless steel kettle with ball valve, in-wall thermometer, and thru-valve stainer/filter

2 copper tube wort chillers with hose connections

1 5 gallon bottling bucket

digital temperature controller, used to control temp in a fridge or freezer so you can ferment at an exact temp

refrigerator/freezer, modified to fit a 5 gallon cornelius keg and supply CO2 from tank outside

Blichmann beer gun and all fittings, used to bottle carbonated beer straight from the keg

Party Pig gasless kegging system, pretty cool for taking beer to parties, google it

stir plate and 2L Erlenmeyer flask for making yeast starters

digital gram scale for accurately measuring hops and other ingredients

case of 24 12oz bottles

case of 12 22 oz bottles

several caps, fittings, misc, sanitizers and cleaners, testing equipment, hydrometer

Already sold my keg system and fermenters.  You'll need fermenters to make beer, but these are 15-20 at High Gravity in Tulsa.  I probably have over $900 in all this stuff that's left, and that's from shopping around for bargains. I'll let the whole thing go for $400 or trade for gun. If you don't want it all we can work something else out.

If you're thinking of getting into the hobby this will give you everything you need and more. Ingredients are available online, or I've always bought local from High Gravity at 71st & Memorial, they're on the web too.

Beautiful walnut stock, older deerfield 3-9x scope that is on an incredibly solid mount, and shoots shorts, longs, or standard long rifle rounds. Only issues to note are that some of the finish has come off the outside of the barrel over time and there is one screw missing that holds the tube magazine on. As such I'm selling way under the normal selling price of $250ish for these rifles. Only had a chance to shoot this one at the range once and it was quite the tack driver."

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched 
accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately.

The CVA Electra .50 Electronic ARC Ignition Muzzleloader with Fiber Optic Sights is easy to fire and easy to clean. The ARC Electronic Ignition system is completely sealed from the elements, and only the barrel needs to be cleaned of fouling. The
electronic switch trigger eliminates pressure explosions, giving you a more accurate shot and allowing full and consistent burn of the powder charge in the barrel. .50-caliber muzzleloading ammunition not included. Requires one 9 volt battery (included) for approximately 500 shots and 600 hours of use.

What you are buying:

The pistol
installed night sites
extra trigger (short trigger that shipped with the gun, was swapped to standard trigger by a sig armorer and is included with the gun)
Three 8 round magazines
One 10 round magazine
Original case and paperwork shipped with firearm including warranty info from sig

Purchase price includes transfer fee from My FFL ($35) AND overnight shipping ($60) within the lower 48.

If you are local (pretty much anyplace within AZ) and willing to do face to face and FFL transfer or sign a bill of sale and provide current ID then the price is negotiable.

If you have something to trade, I am always looking for AR lowers from good manufacturers, and possible accessories or ammo, but cash is king.

Silver Tip? Yellow Tip? Steel Core? Lead Core? I Prefer ""Copper Washed"" over Thickly Lacquered/Plastic-Coated Cases. Thin Lacquer is just fine!

The Bulgarian ammo runs very well through Mosin Nagants and other 7.62x54R Rifles... heck, most folks prefer it because it is such nice ammo!

""WTF?!?"" I hear y'all asking. ""Wasting time & energy trading to just wind up with basically the same darn thing?!? Or maybe even Lesser Quality Ammo?!? It makes no sense!!! What does this guy know that I don't know??? Do I have to liquidate my stock of Bulgarian 7.62x54R???"" Well, no. Here is the scoop:

I am running this in a converted Belt-Fed Browning 1919A4 and it just does not like the Heavier Bulgarian Cases! No problems with Russian MilSurp, though... Go figure!!!

So... you get PRISTINE, Highly-Desirable Bulgarian 7.62x54R in exchange for your Russian 7.62x54R. 

I don't want to sell my ammo... I just want to obtain ammo that will not be an issue in my Browning. And... unless you are Belt-Feeding This Ammo through YOUR Browning... it should perform beautifully for you!

Below is what I have for trade.  I can include cash for the right deal. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

1. Rock River AR-15: This is an upgraded M4 style (military tacitical style with short, lightweight barrel). It has an upgraded RRA Operator stock (as opposed to the standard RRA tactical stock on the unfired AR), a free float quad rail (as opposed to the standard handguard that you can't mount anything to), a winter trigger guard, front flip up sight (instead of stationary), a tactical muzzle break, two-stage trigger (very nice trigger), ergonomic grip (as opposed to the standard hogue), and a chrome lined barrel. It has two magazines through it and is in perfect condition (no blemishes, scratches, scuffs). I also have a bunch of accessories: extra magazines, ammo, Lucid HD7 red dot sight with 3x magnifier, soft and hard carry cases. The Lucid is an awesome red dot.  I have it installed on another AR I have, but have never shot the AR with the sight mounted to the gun. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

2. Kimber 1911: It has new Trijicon night sights. It's in perfect condition. I have everthing it came with originally and a bunch of extra aftermarket and factory magazines (after markets are actually known to be more reliable than the Kimber mags). I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

3. Glock 21sf: .45 caliber Glock with the short frame (""SF""). The SF style has a more manageable slimmer grip. Feels a lot less like a brick! It has new Meprolight night sights. I have over 10 magazines for it. Excellent condition with everything it came with originally. I have other Glocks as well, but not sure I can part with them. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

4. Sig Sauer P238 Gambler: This is a limited edition by Sig. It's similar to the Rosewood edition but has the word ""The Gambler"" etched in gold on the side of the slide and a ""dead man's"" poker hand on the top. It is no longer being manufactured by Sig, so it has collector value in addition to being one of the best pocket pistols available. It has not been fired and is new in the box it came in with one magazine and a paddle holster.  It has the new style snag free night sights.  I also have a Crossbreed Minituck for it as well (best IWB holster you can buy in my opinion).  The holster is made to fit the gun with a Crimson Trace laser attached to the trigger of the gun.

With the body on, I'm sure it's 5 ft long.

Let me reemphasize that for you. This is NOT one of those junky toy electric helicopters you can hold in one hand. This has an engine on it that could double duty as a weed whacker. 

Since this is old, not made any more, etc... I'm not trading MY low price against YOUR high price. I feel like people don't know how to barter any more? Average vs average price or low vs low.

The Remington Model 700 series is the all-time best selling line of bolt action sporting rifles in the world. They were an immediate hit when introduced in 1962 and have never looked back. The Model 700 has also become the favored action of many custom rifle builders.

The Model 700 action was designed for ease of manufacture, given the manufacturing technology of the early 1960's, and uses a round action machined from bar stock, a plunger ejector in the bolt face and a sort of circlip in the bolt face that snaps over the rim of a chambered cartridge to extract the fired brass. The bolt face is recessed to enclose the base of the cartridge, which is also surrounded by the chamber end of the barrel and the front receiver ring. The cartridge head is thus circled by three rings of steel, much as with the Weatherby Mark V action, and this fact was not overlooked by the Remington advertising department.

Traditionalists considered these cost cutting innovations ""cheap,"" but the customers responded in droves to the undeniable good looks of the Model 700 ADL and BDL rifles themselves. They were among the best looking hunting rifles ever introduced and the stock design handled recoil very well, which made them pleasant to shoot. The two position safety (back for ""safe"" and forward for ""fire"") at the rear of the action is easy to operate; it used to lock the bolt (to prevent inadvertent opening in the field) as well as the trigger, but the former feature has been eliminated. They were also hell for strong and very accurate. An excellent user-adjustable trigger with the exceptionally fast lock time of 3.0 milliseconds complemented the inherent accuracy of the new rifles.

Remington got a leg up on the market because in 1964 Winchester introduced a revised version of their famous Model 70 rifle--really a new action--also designed for easier manufacture, that pleased practically no one. The new Model 70 was actually a good action, but the stock design, barrel bedding, checkering, and so forth left a lot to be desired. Many previous Winchester customers turned to the sharp looking Model 700 from Remington.

The Model 700 has evolved with the market place and today it is available in a bewildering array of models. Some are pretty plain and some are bespoke rifles turned out to special order in Remington's Custom Gun Shop. Model 700 barreled actions are made from carbon or stainless steel, with matte or polished finishes, and stocked in solid walnut, laminated wood, and synthetic materials. They come in a variety of barrel lengths and contours and for a wide range of cartridges. The constant (at least for the centerfire rifles) is the Model 700 action itself, the heart of every Model 700 rifle.

I have been involved with Model 700 rifles since 1965 and I have lost track of all of the permutations over the years. In 2008 alone the Remington catalog lists some 21 variations of Model 700's, excluding Custom Shop offerings.

It is impossible to chronicle so many models in one article, so I will attempt to describe only a few of the best known and most interesting Model 700 variations. For 2008, the top of the Model 700 line is the CDL (blued barreled action and walnut stock) and CDL SF (stainless/fluted barreled action and walnut stock). CDL models come standard with a hinged magazine floorplate (the release button is inside the front of the trigger guard). The classic style, straight comb stocks are laser cut checkered in a generous pattern and supplied with studs for detachable sling swivels. Both the barreled action and the stock of all CDL models wears a non-glare satin finish. We have reviewed the 2008 Limited Edition version of the Model 700 CDL SF in .260 caliber, so for further details about this model I will simply refer you to the Product review Page.

The Model 700 BDL (which I translate as ""B-grade Deluxe"") was the flagship of the Model 700 line from its inception until the introduction of the CDL in 2005. BDL models come standard with a hinged magazine floorplate (the release button is inside the front of the trigger guard) or a detachable box magazine (""DM"" versions). Stocks are checkered and supplied with studs for detachable sling swivels. Left handed BDL's are available.

The traditional BDL comes with a genuine walnut Monte Carlo style stock which is cut checkered in an attractive skip-line point pattern that wraps around the fore-end. This stock is fitted with a black fore-end tip, pistol grip cap, and black butt plate or recoil pad (in magnum calibers), all set off by white line spacers. The barreled action receives Remington's polished blue finish. An adjustable open rear and hooded ramp front sight are standard. This is Remington's most attractive regular production rifle.

Over the years, the walnut stocked BDL has been available in more calibers than any other Model 700 variation. in 2005 the list included .17 Rem., .222 Rem., .223 Rem., .22-250 Rem., .243 Win., .25-06 Rem., .270 Win., 7mm-08 Rem., .280 Rem., 7mm Rem. Mag., 7mm Ultra Mag, .308 Win., .30-06 Spfd., .300 Win. Mag., .300 Ultra Mag, .338 Win. Mag., .338 Ultra Mag and .375 Ultra Mag, but by 2008 the list had been significently reduced in favor of the newer Model 700 CDL.

There is also a Synthetic Stainless BDL. This version features a matte black synthetic stock with a recoil pad and a satin (silver) stainless steel barreled action without sights. The BDL Synthetic Stainless is a handsome example of a rifle of its type. It is available in calibers .270 Win., 7mm Rem. SAUM, 7mm Rem. Mag., 7mm Ultra Mag, .30-06 Spfd., .300 Rem. SAUM, .300 Win. Mag., .300 Ultra Mag, .338 Win. Mag., .338 Ultra Mag, .375 H&H Mag. and .375 Ultra Mag.

Special long range Model 700's include the Sendero SF and Varmint rifles. The Sendero SF is an ultra-long range big game rifle that features a fluted, stainless steel, heavy barreled action in a special, un-checkered, aramid-fiber-reinforced stock with full length aluminum bedding blocks. Calibers are limited to the various 7mm and .300 Magnums, plus the .338 Ultra Mag.

The three Model 700 Varmint rifles are the 700 VS, a heavy barreled varmint rifle with a fiberglass composite stock; the 700 VLS, a heavy barrel varmint rifle in a laminated wood Monte Carlo style stock; and the 700 VS SF, with a heavy, fluted, stainless steel barreled action in a fiberglass composite stock. None of these stocks are checkered. Calibers include .220 Swift, .223 Rem., .22-250 Rem. and .308 Win. The latter, of course, is not a varmint caliber at all.


An oddity is the Ultimate Lightweight Model 700 Titanium. This features a titanium action mated to a 22"" lightweight stainless steel barrel, a fluted bolt, and a very plain, un-checkered, carbon-fiber composite stock. It weighs only 5 1/4 pounds in short action calibers .260 Rem., 7mm-08 Rem. and .308 Win. or 5 1/2 pounds in long action calibers .270 Win. and .30-06 Spfd. Maybe they should have named it the Ultimate Kick Model 700 Titanium!

One of the neatest Model 700's is the Mountain Rifle LSS. The Mountain Rifle LSS is a deluxe model that features a stainless steel barreled action with a slim profile 22"" barrel and a slender, modern classic style, laminated hardwood stock. It is what Remington refers to as a ""Specialty"" rifle. Remington literature says that the Model 700 Mountain Rifle is designed for wilderness or high country pack-in hunts that involve rigorous hiking.

In the Remington world, ""LSS"" signifies a rifle with laminated wood stock and stainless steel metal parts. The internal magazine has a hinged floorplate with a trigger guard mounted release. The stock is stained a medium walnut brown color. The barreled action is made from satin finished 416 stainless steel. It is a good looking rifle that stops just this side of being gaudy--a line that other stainless/laminated rifles often, unfortunately, cross to their detriment. The stock has a tough synthetic finish to protect it from the elements. It also has a black forearm tip, a black pistol grip cap, a solid rubber butt pad and studs for detachable sling swivels. It is checkered in a generous and deeply laser cut point pattern that wraps completely around the forearm. Calibers offered in 2008 are .270 Winchester, .280 Remington, 7mm-08 and .30-06.

Remington Model 700 rifles have always had an excellent reputation for accuracy and that has been my experience with them. To this day the deluxe models remain among the best shooting and nicest looking production rifles on the market.

This is a unique rifle as it is a M91 built thru the Finnish Civil Guard program. The rifle is a mix of parts consisting of a 1913 Isvhesk receiver, New England Westinghouse (American made) barrel, Westinghouse bolt face and cocking knob, Westinghouse bolt slide, Isvhesk trigger guard/magazine, and I thinkit was a Tula bolt body handle with matching serial number,making this a Finn matching rifle. The bore looks great considering this is an almost 100 year old rifle built to defeat a  world super power by a little snowy country, and possibly used in a few wars. The stock is a Finnish M91s stock with hangers and round finger wartime splices, and a couple plugs. The CivilGuard number is on the side of the barrel,starting with a SS. If you look up the district codes, you can findout where this rifle served. Very neat rifle. I have not shot it. I did disassemble it as it was missing the extractor when I got it, so now it has a later 2 piece extractor. It's all I had in my spare parts bin. But there was really no rust under the woodline,or major noticable pitting. I did put a little oil on the metal to protect it while I had it apart.  I do not want to sell this rifle, but need to, to pay some bills. If I do not get what I need for it, I will likely keep the rifle and find other means to pay the bills. Any questions, feel free to ask. I am not really able to drive long distances to meet up, but local pick up is fine. I am located in Westminster MD.  Ican ship if you pay shipping and can supply a FFL and they acceptfrom an individual. I will need your name, and to sign a quick bill of sale along with seeing your drivers license to verify you are a MD resident. Otherwise it's all a face to face transaction.  Don't worry, if the UN ever comes looking for our rifles, your bill of sale along with all the rest I have may accidentally get lost, so don't worry about it. The bill of sale is just to cover my rear.  Thanks for looking at a great rifle and peice of history."

All you have to do is take your Glock lower, drop the Glock Block on it (included, basically a feed ramp), attach it to the upper, and you're ready to go! It takes as much time to install as the slide to your Glock does.

The 10mm uses your full size 10mm or .45acp Glock frame (glock 20/21).  Uses Glock 20 mags.

The 460 Rowland/.45acp uses your full size 10mm or .45acp Glock frame (Glock 20/21).  You can shoot the powerful 460 Rowland out of this bad boy, or use regular .45acp!  Uses Glock 21 mags.

The 9mm uses your full size 9mm, 40, or 357Sig frame (Glock 17, 22, 31).  Just use any of the frames, throw in a Glock 17 or 18 mag, and have at it!

These are a cheap way to turn your pistol into a hog/deer slayer or just to have some fun at the range.

Each is $275 with Glock Block feed ramp.  Trades considered.

Slick bolt, decent bore. Comes with repaired sniper stock, wartime sling slots. The stock is not one of those shiney new refurb stocks, it has........character. Like it has been there, done that, which it probably did. The stock has a few repairs, Numbers matching gun. The cosmo has been cleaned from inside the rifle, the stock still has a little in it. I took the stock off and placed the wood it my attic this summer to sweat the cosmo out this summer, but didn't get allof it out. Only modification I have done to this rifle is add a Finnish 2 stage trigger but still have the original trigger parts. Shoots well, but a little low right. Don't know if it's the rifle or me since I am tilted. I am unable to drive long distances to meet, sopick upin Westminster, MD is available. I will ship to a FFL, as long as they are OK with receiving from an individual. Just  need to get you name soI can type up a bill of sale ( to cover my rear) and see a MD drivers license to confirm your residency. Don't worry, if the UN shows up to take our rifles, I am sure my paperwork will somehow get misplaced. Oh yeah, the rifle is an Isvhesk, 1944, and I cannot find import stamps on the rifle. Got it off Gunbroker about a year ago. Need to sell to pay bills unfortunately as I love this rifle. Thanks for looking!"

A few points to save some of you the keystrokes-

1) ""Cash"" or ""cash today"" is not meaningful. Cash is all I'll take unless you have a very cool trade.  Plastic is not very cool.   
2) I am not broke, destitute, unemployed, upside down on my mortgage, or otherwise desperate for money.  
3) I'd buy another dozen of these at $800-850, so I'm not selling at that price.
4) I don't have the Pachmayr grips. They cost about $25, so I will be happy to acquire a set for you or discount accordingly.

Peace out, and thanks for looking!"

The word from the guy I got this from is that his dad bought this in 1952 and got his deer with this gun every year until he was done hunting a couple years ago. That's alot of deer !! I would rate this gun excellent. It has been drilled for scope and they look good and I have plugged the holes (4) BUT the 2 holes in the middle are off a little bit, So if you are planning to put a scope on it you may have to play with a dremmel tool for the base. Personally, I would not even think of a scope on this gun because the old iron sights are so nice on it.

Manufactured in 1909, this is in AMAZING shape for it's 103 year age. All Serial numbers match and the only thing taking away from a much higher collectors value was that it was re-chambered in .30-06 at some point. This is a good thing if you're like me and will actually shoot the rifle, as it's a much more common calibre and much cheaper then the original chambering of the weapon. I've shot it just a few times, but with out sighting it in or being familiar with the rifle, was holding 1-2"" groups at 100 yds.

 This is the 9mm version and comes in hard plastic case and sleeve
 Description 
Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Pistol Model in 9mm. It's been stored and is in excellent condition. The gun pictured may have a different serial number, but is a NIB Uzi. 
The UZI pistol was developed by Israel Military Industries (now IWI Ltd) during early 1980s from the famous Micro-UZI submachine gun. Intended users for the UZI pistol were various security agencies and services which wanted a high-capacity semi-automatic pistol, and civilian shooters (mostly in USA) which also wanted such gun with ""cool Uzi style"". Despite somewhat rough appearance UZI pistols were reliable and quite accurate. It also must be noted that 'original' UZI pistols should not be confused with full-size weapons based on semi-automatic only full-size Uzi carbines but without the shoulder stock. 
UZI pistol is blowback-operated semi-automatic weapon which fires from closed bolt. It has a stamped steel receiver and the bolt is fully enclosed inside. Bolt is of 'telescoped' design, that is, it is hollow in the front and encloses the rear part of the barrel when in battery. Uzi pistol has a single action trigger and utilizes an internal sliding striker (firing pin). Manual safety of sliding type, and is located above the grip on the left side of the gun. Magazines are of double stack design, interchangeable with other guns of Uzi family (in 9mm caliber). Sights are of open type, with flip-up rear sight, adjustable for windage. The guns were manufactured and fully assembled in Israel. Action Arms imported them as complete guns. You'll get the highest quality UZI Pistol you can get.

Description 
Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Model B in 9mm. It's been stored and is in excellent condition. The gun pictured may have a different serial number, but is a NIB Uzi. The guns were manufactured and fully assembled in Israel. Action Arms imported them as complete guns. You'll get the highest quality UZI Carbine you can get.
