Forend has the Magpul single rail and comes with a broom stick. (if you are interested in the USMC issue M-4 drag bag in the picture make me an offer, it is not included in this price)

Rifle has forward sling mount removed, and the rear pin on the lower reciever has had the detent removed. Otherwise this rifle is fully complete and functional. 

I am a collegiate certified gunsmith, and I have fired/inspected/cleaned this gun with absolute satisfaction. It has probably had close to 2,500 rnds fired on this bolt, and the bolt/carrier appear to factory original. Rifling in this BBL is still good and accurate, It hits steel at 300 yds all day with open sights.

I am not currently offering any gunsmithing services in the Taos area other than cleanings and safety inspections, but I can get any parts or AR accesories you need bottom dollar. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Cash is King, but would love to trade straight up for an older model Enduro  or Dual-Sport motorcycle. Must have title, would want to use it as a commuter.  Engine must run and be safe, but I can deal with cosmetics tires and a tune up. Thanks for reading!

Yes, it is a Jennings J-22, and we all know those pistols are not high end firearms and many are jam-o-matic pieces of crap, but this is one of the good ones.  I put 100 rounds of mixed ammunition through it with minimal problems.  It likes CCI Stingers the best and will eat them all day.  CCI Mini Mags also run well in this pistol.  Had a few jams with American Eagle.  Did not try cheap bulk ammo as unjacketed standard velocity rounds do not run well in these pistols.  Feed ramp, firing pin, extractor claw, and mags are all in great shape.  As far as J-22s go, this one is reliable and should last a lifetime.  The J-22s are decent guns with a solid following, later versions by Calwestco and Jimenez were not as reliable, and higher caliber versions in .380 had a well deserved bad reputation.  This is an early Bryco done on the original Jennings tooling with the pirate logo on the slide.

Pistol is black with black grips.  Has the improved safety switch.  Finish is in nice shape, a small bit of discoloration on the grips from solvent.  I'd rate it 90% overall.

Pistol comes with lots of extras!  8 magazines total, and they're all good ones.  Magazines only hold 6 rounds -- don't try to force a 7th one in or you'll damage the spring.  Extra firing pin, fp spring, and takedown button.  A leather belt holster.  Also have a set of old style wood grips that will need to be filed down to accommodate the new style safety, which I intended to do but never got around to it.

This is a GREAT plinker and fun gun for shooting cans up in the mountains, or a nice beater for your tacklebox.  It is not a target pistol and I would not recommend it for protection, although it is really tiny and will easily fit in a pocket.  Due to the SA striker firing system, these guns (and others like it, such as the Colt Vest Pocket or Baby Browning) should not be carried or stored with a round chambered.  This is a nice little plinker for someone.

You need to be over 21 and not a dirtbag.  Will need to see a CO DL to verify age and residency.  Thanks.

Price of 140 is pretty firm considering all the extras.  Will do a full or partial trade for good quality .38 Special ammo.

Supposedly it will hold up to 24 long guns, but that may be pushing it if you don't want them stacked like cordwood! It has a lot of room inside, and has a bunch of adjustable shelves and such to fit your needs. All the brackets and hardware are included. Inside there are some stains in the carpet, but again it all works great. No bad smells (non-smoking home). These safes were and are about $800 at Costco; now's your chance to get one for a greatly reduced price. I might also be interested in a trade/partial trade for firearms (probably not interested in sporterized military bolts, Sks or AK's. I like old Colt and S&W revolvers, anything interesting. Let me know what you have and we'll talk).

We are located just north of Sedro-Woolley. I have a forklift on site and can help you load it into your vehicle. It weighs about 400 pounds.
I can probably deliver a short distance for free, or possibly as far as the Seattle area or Bellingham for $ for fuel and my time. I have a truck with a lift gate and heavy dolly to help you place it in your home if need be.

This link is the current one Costco is selling, and is very similar to the one I have for sale: http://www.costco.com/Browse/Product.as ... InCategory

The 3X Magnifier screws into the internal threads of the PVS-14 or PVS-7 objective lens or snaps onto the objective of the MUM when coupled with the MUM/ MiNi-14 Magnifier Adapter.

The USGI 3X Magnifier is a great accessory that increases the versatility of your night vision monocular. We recommend using the magnifier when the monocular is employed in a weapon-mounted or hand-held surveillance mode. It can be run while head-mounted, but we do not recommend this for several reasons. First, trying to negotiate terrain while maintaining situational awareness with a magnified night vision optic on your head is difficult at best and dangerous at worst. Secondly, the added weight and cantilevered distance will more quickly fatigue your neck and back. However, the 3X Magnifier excels in its other roles and should be a staple accessory for anyone employing a night vision monocular

If you don't know STI, they are manufacturers of competition 1911 based firearms.  Their top end systems are around $4k and hold numerous records.  The SPARTAN is their ""entry level"" gun and is anything but AN entry level 1911.  With this gun you will be able to out shoot your buddies with their Kimbers and have a lot of ca$h left over for ammo and accessories.

Serial # L0721XXH The condition of this shotgun is 95% on both the blueing and the furniture. I took it out last weekend and shot it, and it functioned flawlessly with 3"" 7 1/2 game loads and 9 shot target loads. Super lightweight, super fun to shoot, and VERY little recoil. 

This would be a great shotgun for your wife, or someone recoil sensitive. It also is a great shotgun for hunting squirrels! However, take good care of it as this is a rare bird. The condition is fantastic, and it is an Improved Cylinder Fixed Chole. This shotgun already has substantial appreciation on the collector's market, and will surely continue to rise. 

My plan was to buy it and restock it with a youth model stock. However, I just don't trust my kids to take this out and not scratch it up. Therefore, I purchased a youth model, less valuable shotgun for them. 

The l.o.p. on this is 14 1/2"" and still has the original Remington Butt Pad. It has NOT been cut down. This was part of a collection someone had, and used to be with a 16 and 28 gauge that was owned more for the collectible side of it than the shooting side of it. I am not positive it was shot before I shot it this last weekend. 

As you can see it does have the Vent Rib Barrel and the original front bead is still there. 

Feel free to let me know if you would like any additional pictures. 

As far as trades go, I am happy to entertain trades but I am not looking for anything right now so you will have to come strong. I prefer cash. 

For $20 extra I am willing to ship direct to your door in Texas if you give me an email statement of your legal status to purchase a firearm and a copy of your driver's license. Otherwise, I will ship to an FFL. If you are out of state, I will ship to your FFL for the same $20."

It looked like new then and still does. You can only tell that it's been fired by the slight wear on the hammer and lever. It has been used, the box was not kept. The size is good for an adult or a child that is grown enough to move up from a single shot. The original owner sold it when he upgraded to the Annie Oakley octagonal model and now I've upgraded to a 1971 NRA 100 year octagonal barrel model. This was made BEFORE the lawyers designed a cross bolt safety. It's smooth and well made. You may be able to find a NEW .22 cheaper and that's what you'll get. It's your choice. I CAN'T DO PHOTOS. NO TRADES, NO SHIPPING, NO OFFERS, thanks. $400 CASH FIRM, LOCAL ONLY. Hey, don't tell me you can't make any money on it. If that's your game flip a couple of High Points!

These knives are immune to salt water and almost any other chemical attack, so they do not need cleaning.

No MPK has been broken in the field and unlike steel, it will not break in arctic conditions. It holds its edge and is easily field sharpened. 40% lighter than steel and ergonomically made for the human hand, this is the finest dive knife on the market today.

I've got a 1938 mosin nagant. I believe it is an izzy, it is a round receiver. It comes with 68rds of ammo, all the original accessories. I also have a few extras for it-mosin nagant recoil pad, rear sight leaf mount for a scope, cheap red dot and case. 

It is in great shape and a great shooter. The stock has been refinished a very nice dark cherry color and the metal has been duracoated black. The bore is in very good shape and the bolt does not stick. It is not matching numbers. 

I am asking $170 for everything or I'd like to trade towards an ak variant with cash added on my end. 

I am on the northside of Indy but can travel anywhere around the 465 loop.

We’ll teach this class to as little as four students. This class can take from two to four hours depending on the needs of the students attending. Generally it averages three hours in length including classroom and range time learning how to shoot with confidence. Students will learn the rules for safe gun handling; pistol parts and operation; ammunition; shooting fundamentals; cleaning the pistol; and continued opportunities for skill development. Students will also be introduced to training and using laser sights for personal and home defense.

Up for sale is my brand new never fired CZ (91153) with 300 rounds of winchester nato spec 9mm. These are very hard to find. You hardly ever see one in any store in IL. Closest I found was the lower priced Phantom and the dealer wanted 700. It would have been over 760 out the door. Perfectly balanced all steel combat handgun. Comes with original box, plastic case, papers, cleaning rods, lock and two 18rd mags.

I planned on breaking it in with the nato spec and then seeing if it would run cheap walmart loads without swapping springs.

The gun has never been fired. I field stripped it and cleaned it and tested it with snap caps thats all.

Once you pick it up you will want it. It feels so perfect and balanced the all steel contrcution will soak up the recoil quite a bit, making it an excelent shooter for new and experienced shooters alike.

If it doesnt sell soon it will be posted as a newly broken in pistol :) as I am dying to shoot this thing.

You will not find this instock anywhere online. There was one on gunbroker for 700+ fees. it took me months to find it instock and when it shipped to my FFL he was floored that I got one he couldnt even get one.

MSRP is 660 + the ammo 125 ( got it from Cabelas) is $785.

Same thing as above, I rebuilt a savage action in 6x45 and shoot it more than the CZ. However, the cz is one of the most accurate guns out of the box. Below is a pic of my average groupings with this gun at 200yds. Includes the rings, but not the scope. Gun has around 500rds through it. It has a micro-mauser action that is as smooth as they get.

It has fluid steel barrels and is a working, shootable gun. It is not choked full, so would make a good rabbit or bird gun. Bores have some minor rough spots and some areas are still shiny. There is a little looseness at the barrel-breech mating, but it is still plenty tight enough to still use. Wood is not cracked. Finish is mostly brown, but very little pitting...It is just a neat old piece of our hunting heritage."
