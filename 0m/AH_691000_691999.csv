On a particular solo run on the Gixxer, the man/machine interface was direct and inspirational, not wanting of a dollop more power or a scintilla of a quicker flick. Its available power is plentiful and the gearbox and slipper clutch works seamlessly at the command of your fingers and toes. The twisty road ahead is consumed to the accompaniment of a beautiful scream from the injected Four. It's difficult to imagine an experience much better.

I smoothed and polished the trigger assembly, feed ramp, and slide contact points with multiple grits of sandpaper and polishing compounds. I finished with jewelers polish on a dremel tool. This helped the gun function MUCH better, but it was not perfect. I then sent it back to Jimenez who replaced the slide due to a casting defect and gave me 2 free magazines.

OK let me just say that I have collected these over the years for the purpose of having the finest example of each in the 9X18 caliber that I could find.

The P64 has been fired but the finish is near perfect. I would rate it @ 98%. My intention is to sell all three at this point.

Gun was carried by former owner in a slide holster, so there are several scratches on the right side muzzle and grips, much less wear on the left side. Some bluing wear on the exposed barrel, but the gun shoots great and there is no rust or freckeling anywhere.  Shoots like a  dream, eats virtually any 9mm ammo you feed it.  I have decided a smaller pistol is just easier for me to carry, although it is a ton of fun to shoot at the range.  Since the holster is molded to fit the Beretta 92, it just makes sense to offer it with the pistol.  The SWAT rig has double rubber thigh straps/clips and a thigh shield, lists alone for more than $100.  It is LEO-issue.

Comes with original Beretta 15 round magazine and 2 quality metal aftermarket 15 round magazines.  Also fits perfectly in a leather Bianchi #13 Scorpio shoulder holster with double magazine pouch on the side.  Has all leather gun holster, leather mag pouch, leather upper shoulder straps and cloth lower straps, using a 4-way plastic connector at the middle back to offer easy movement and comfortable fit.

Holster is in excellent shape, barely looks worn.  Great package, holster usually brings close to $100 when sold on auction sites:

Beautiful upgraded wood has great detail and is very finely figured.  Works flawlessly -- very well maintained and cared for.  Warranty card was never filled out, so it still has the 3 pit stops available to the new owner and, of course the lifetime warranty.  The action is very tight and has no play at all.  Light wear marks on the stock from use at the skeet range, but no gouges or deep scratches.  Case coloring is in awesome condition.  I would rate the overall condition at around 90% very conservatively.

Comes with full set of original chokes, wrench, original hard case, and blank warranty card.

email me if you have any questions or want more pictures of the gun.

It is a 3-12x50 with the Ballistic Plex reticle. This was produced to be a top of the line scope for Burris, designed to compete with the high end Euro optics. I have owned many scopes, and this is a very nice piece of glass. One thing I really loved was its performance in low light conditions. It really shined on late night hunts and target shoots, as I was able to make out targets others were not. Another nice thing about this scope is it carried the Burris lifetime warranty, regardless of the owner. If you ever have any problem, Burris will correct it on their dime no questions asked. This was mounted on my LR-308 in a Larue mount, and it performed very well and was always well cared for. The glass was only cleaned with a lens pen, and it was kept covered when not in use. I never had a single problem with it holding zero or not tracking 100%, it was perfectly reliable as a scope should be. The last time I had it out was at an Appleseed event, and it was ringing steel at long range with no problem.

The scope will come with its original box, packaging, scope cover, and also front and rear Butler Creek flip up covers. These were sold new for around $800 without the covers. Yours for $450. I will get some more photos if needed, but here are a couple of it mounted. Larue SPR-E, and Docter MRD not included.

SIGLITE night sights also seem to be common among ""Blue Line"" Sig Pros. The Sig Pro pistol itself is identical to civilian Sig Pros except for a ""Blue Line"" crest on the top of the slide, between the rear sight and ejection port, like in the photo below:

Non-LE individuals can purchase and use ""Blue Line"" Sig Pros. Prior to 09/14/2004, it was common practice for dealers to replace the three LE magazines with (at the time) legal 10-round magazines. However, this is no longer necessary because full-capacity magazines can now be purchased, regardless of any markings that would suggest otherwise. Please check with local and state laws to make sure that you are not in a jurisdiction that has its own ban on full-capacity magazines.

The product codes—as indicated on the sticker attached to the outside of the case—are different that standard Sig Pros, as follows:
The initial ""SP"" is replaced by ""BL"" (standing for, you guessed it, ""Blue Line"")
An additional letter, along with a hyphen to separate it from the previous letter or letters, is added to the product code, specifically ""-G,"" which presumably means ""Government""

So, if a standard Sig Pro SP 2340 chambered in .40 Auto with SIGLITE night sights has ""SP2340-40-BSS"" as its product code, the corresponding ""Blue Line"" version would thus have ""BL2340-40-BSS-G"" as its.

This weapon was a department weapon and has been used. It has the marks and scars of such. It functions great and has been taken care of. Being a Sig, it just works.
Options: Factory night sights/3 -12 round magazines that except either .40 cal or .357 Sig/Blueline stamp/factory case. **Has a rail for tact light, but is a rare design that only fits one tact light made** -will not accept normal 1913 rail tact lights. I have this tact light that has ambidextrous controls. But this tact light is separate from advertised price. It would be + $130 with 4 rare batteries - rare military batteries.
The back strap of this weapon has 2 factory choices but I only have the one to answer any questions.
I'm reasonable on this weapon/price, but common sense applies. For sale purposes, cash only, buyer must have purchase permit or cpl. The only trade I would consider would be quality 1911 full size w/night sights/tact rail, or high end EO Tech. Buyer must still have permit/cpl. If you want pics just ask, more than happy to send some, but haven't been able to post them on them here."

My wife is squeamish about it because it is an old russian rifle that may have bad mojo from past wars. It was one of three with the hex receiver that the dealer had available. I hand picked it from the others. The rifling is really nice. Before my wife learned the history of these rifles, she encouraged me to buy it because she liked the wood. All numbers match except the bayonet. It comes with the sling, two double ammo pouches, tool and cleaning accessories kit, bayonet, oil can, and 20 rounds of ammo. At this price, I will be in the hole because I have disassembled the gun twice and cleaned the cosmoline out and oiled it up nicely. It's ready to fire. I took the bolt completely apart and was very methodical about getting all of the cosmoline out of every crevice and orifice. This rifle is a nice find and a real piece of history.

EOTech's shortest sight yet, the XPS3-0 holographic weapons sight (HWS) is smaller and lighter than other HWS sights yet still provides high-quality visibility in any light condition. The XPS3-0 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.
The XPS3-0 runs on a single 123 battery and requires at most 2-3/4 inches of rail space. This leaves more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers, or NV mounts. EOTech also eliminated the battery cap and latch and replaced them with a simple tethered O-ring cap to better seal out moisture. Other features include a battery life of up to 600 hours at brightness level 12, fogproof internal optics, water-resistance to 33 feet, and night vision compatibility.

OK let me just say that I have collected these over the years for the purpose of having the finest example of each in the 9X18 caliber that I could find. With that said the Makarov (to me) appears to have never been fired and the finish is perfect. The PA-63 IS new and unfired, again with a perfect finish. The P64 has been fired but the finish is near perfect. I would rate it @ 98%. My intention is to sell all three at this point. I am in no hurry to sell and $750.00 is a FAIR price for these kind of pistols with NO holster wear. Feel free to email any questions but trades im not looking for.

 * Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
 * The bolt of the VZ 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
 * The VZ 58 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
 * The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ 58.
 * The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ 58.
 * The VZ 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. 
* The alloy magazine of the VZ 58 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lb. vs. .84 lb.)
 * VZ 58 is easier to field strip.
 * The VZ 58 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure trade value is $600. no cash price i want to trade toward a basic off brand ar 15 as long as it functions right text or call for fast response. 1-REDACTED . these are excellent quality wepons and a blast to shoot and also very accurate. . must be legal to own"
