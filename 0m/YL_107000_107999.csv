After receiving it from the factory, I have not shot it - just kept in my collection.  This gun functions like it's brand new, having the Colt ""bank-vault"" lock up when cocked (no cylinder play).  Overall the gun is really good looking - the grips that are on it really make it look great.  I don't have the orig. box but I have a very nice case for it that I will include in the sale.
I will entertain cash offers or potential trades - the only guns that I may be interested are either a H&K USP 45, Glock 21, or Arsenal SGL 31(5.45x39).  Send me an offer or let me know what you have and we can maybe make a deal.  Buyer will pay for transfer fees at local ffl of his/her choice."

BUSHMASTER UPPER- Well we all know about Bushmaster.

PCF Mfg. LOWER - Formed from a blend of  scientifically advanced materials, the PCF C-15 lowers have proven to be among the lightest, most durable composite lowers available today. And because they are molded from a solid color, finish ware and scratches are a thing of the past. Every lower is shipped with the accu-group composite fire control system, a market first in the AR 15 world, and offer a 4.5lb to 5.0lb trigger pull with zero perceived creep, an ultra crisp let off, and incredibly fast lock up times. These lowers also feature a reversible safety to accommodate right or left hand shooters. Still want more? How about a six position buffer tube and slider (commercial)? If that’s not enough, how about the fact that this lower will except any milspec upper and offers an 8% elongation factor, giving it a zero slop fit? No more wedging the back of your lower with extra parts!"

I'm selling a Century M74 AK style assault rifle, chambered in 5.45x39.  This is a fine rifle. Semi-automatic, features a Tapco G2 trigger group and enough US parts to make the rifle 922(r) compliant.  I have swapped the black furniture with some surplus wood furniture that I personally refinished myself. The metal has a dark grey parkerized finish that can be easily duracoated over, or left alone.  It's rugged and looks good. Has a few minor handling marks.

I have fired one tin of Russian ammunition through the gun and have not had a single failure. Very accurate, easy to hit a small gong at 100yds.  Rifle does not keyhole and the front sight is not canted.

This rifle comes with 4 surplus magazines, 3 black poly mags and 1 plum. The plum magazine looks like it was rubbed with steel wool or a wirebrush, but functions fine. I will also include a bayonet/sheath that attaches to the rifle.

For $550 (OBO) you will get: The rifle, 4 magazines, bayonet, both sets of furniture and 1080rds of Russian manufacture 5.45 ammunition in a sealed tin. 

No checks or money orders please.  Cash only. Please do not try to haggle with me when we meet to make the transaction.  All sales are final. I am not interested in shipping this rifle.  To minimize costs, in state buyers only.

If you have any other questions please ask! I will be more than happy to help.  I am selling the rifle because I am moving out of state.

I also have a few other guns for sale that I will list in the coming days:

Ruger 10/22
Browning Buck Mark
Beretta NEOS
Mosin Nagant M91/30 w/ a couple hundred rounds

I'm located in Brockport, but can drive anywhere in the area if needed.

This 1918 BSA Lee Enfield No 1 Mk III* with an Arabic stock disk and rack number on the stock. This rifle has alot of honest looking use from years of history serving somewhere in the Britishicon empire. This is one of the models that was upgraded after World War I with the magazine cutoff (which was cut from production during the war), hence the ""*"" added to the rifle.

No import mark on this one, so it's probably an older import (or was just luck and missed the mark, ha!).

Also has a very nice bore, with good lands and grooves and general brightness to the whole thing. This and the Arabic history were my two reasons for buying this on a whim several months ago. Only problem this rifle has is a crack on the left side of the stock near the receiver, which I've looked at and determined can be fixed relatively easily. Since I haven't shot it yet, I just never got around to it, ha!

Asking only what I have in it, which is $300. It's hard to find decent Lee Enfields these days since those imports seem to have dried up. I wouldn't be selling this if I didn't have too, but there's a particular rifle I'm buying that is one that is very important to me and that I missed the opportunity to buy several years ago.

Just message me if you interested, want more pictures, or want to bargain, ha! Thanks!

The grip and back strap, If you've ever handled one of these SW99's feels like a bar of soap. Even with the thin back strap they have a large hump. The hump was shaved and the back strap lines blended. The grip texture is like a medium to coarse grit sandpaper. The grip texture is very pleasant even after several rounds. The grip was shaped to simulate a 1911 with an arched mainspring housing. It has a Bedair custom built stainless captured guide rod and will include the stock polymer rod. XS Big Dot night sights tops off the package (XS is now used by the US Navy Seals) and comes with 3 factory 9 round magazines, factory box, sights and literature. Also in the deal is a new Aker high ride black leather right hand paddle holster. The SW99 series pistol have a very unique trigger system. You can carry the first round as double action. Or in the long single action, or in the short single action, and at anytime there is a de-cocker located on top of the slide. The de-cocker is very easy to operated with either hand and the magazine release is also ambidextrous and very much like the H&K USP's mounted on both sides at the rear of the trigger guard. I like using my right index finger to operate the mag release and my off hand thumb to operate the de-cocker. The pistol also incorporates a firing pin block that is only released at the full depression of the trigger. S&W is the manufacturer of the slide & barrels and Walther is the maker of the frames on the S&W SW99 series pistols. To date S&W is the only company to manufacture this pistol design in the 45 ACP. Currently Walther & Magnum Research are still manufacturing these in 9mm & .40 S&W only."

All the springs have been put in by me. I haven't fired it after the spring install but I have tested it to make sure it works properly by placing an ear plug between the hammer and pin when firing. Double action has improved greatly. Also comes with Comes with 200 rounds of Winchester Nato .124 grain FMJ, 100 rounds of remington .115 JHP that you can get at walmart, 25 or so federal +p+ JHP ammo, and 50 or so rounds of planking winchester ammo. That's around 400 rounds total give or take. The feed ramp has been polished by me. Feeds most HP but I've noticed that the federals are longer by .030 so the didn't feed as good. But I have tested them out with the new springs. Might of been a mag issue because it had FTF only on the last remaining rounds every other clip. I've used some remington and winchester hollow points with no problems yet. Feeds every FMJ that I've shot through it. Super accurate and fun to shoot just looking to buy something with more power.

The bolt release is the only part not installed, the parts are included.
Roggio Arms lower, with A2 pistol grip and black CTR stock kit installed. Brand new, unfired. 
The finish on the trigger guard is marred, from a roll pin installation that did not go as planned. The tolerence was off, and the roll pin was stuck 4/5's the way in, and would not punch any more in, or out. Took a dremil to it and cut it flush and smoothed it out. Function's 100 percent.
The marring is negligible, and the finish is an easy fix, especially if this rifle is to be a shooter, not a safe queen. 

I just don't have the time to build an upper and piece together another AR15, so I'm parting with it. Asking 200. Lemme know.

If you are in stillwater, or live along the way to stillwater, and might be interested in the lower, but not traveling to norman, I make the trip up to stilly about once a week, so I am willing to meet you along the way or in town, and save you the gas. 
Thanks.

I'd trade for 2 mosin nagants in ""shooter"" condition, not safe queens, or for 1 really nice mosin with accessories and a can of ammo."

Never cut a thing. Been stored in gun cabinet indoors.

The Yari™ has a full tang blade made from 154CM stainless steel. This premium blade steel holds an edge longer than other high carbon stainless steels. Heat treated to 59Rc-61Rc, this allows for excellent edge retention, yet maintains great durability. Made with an attractive bead-blast finish, the blades are blackened to produce a non-reflective, durable, black oxide coating. Yari™ will be available with both fine edge and partially serrated blades.

The handle side plates are made from black canvas micarta. Long used by custom knife makers, this resin/fabric composite is both durable and attractive. Canvas micarta has a warm comfortable feel, and a texture that provides a sure and positive grip. The side plates are attached with blackened stainless steel fasteners. The tang extends beyond the side plates to form the pommel. A hole in the pommel allows for the attachment of a lanyard.

Yari™ comes with an innovative sheath. Made from Concealex, the sheath is molded and riveted to conform tightly to the shape of the knife. The sheath securely holds the knife without any buttons or straps. For deployment, simply pull the knife from the sheath's friction fit. The sheath includes a belt clip. Designed for multiple carrying options, Yari™ can be worn inside the waistband, outside on a belt, or securely fastened to a vest or other load bearing equipment.
