No scratches on the lens, and the body and finish are in near-mint condition. (If the rings have left a ring mark I don't know about it, and I don't plan to dismount the scope until it sells; however, if you buy the scope, and if there are ring marks I'll let you know and you can cancel the transaction if you choose.) 

I bought this scope used about four years ago and have not had any problem with it. I've only had it on one rifle (a 22-250), and never hunted with it -- only took it to the rifle range, and shot multiple sub-MOA five-shot groups with it  (see pictures of a five-shot group shot at approx 85 yds).

The scope was made in Japan (in other words, it was not made in the Phillipines).

I guess it goes without saying that the scope is the only thing being sold -- not the rifle, the bases, or the rings. :)"

Firing 454 Casulls this gun produces the same energy at 100 yards as a 44 magnum does at the muzzle. It will take down anything on this continent with factory loads. Custom loaded it will kill anything on God's green Earth.

It can be used for home defense using 45 Colts. I'd crap myself if I was staring down this barrel. Colt didn't call his gun ""the peace maker"" for nothing! And because it's chambered for 454 it will digest the hottest 45 Colts you can feed it.

It also comes with a one-point sling, the original box, papers, cleaning kit, leaf-sight, original stock and handguard. I'll also include 80 rounds of Wolf Military Classic and a UTG side scope mount FOR FREE!

$525 cash or will trade for a Rock Island Armory commander 1911 (4"" model) plus cash or a Smith & Wesson M&P compact .40 with thumb safety as a straight trade. I would prefer if buyer had GFL (Georgia Firearms License) but, a drivers license will do. I will travel to meet if it's not a 2-3 hour drive one-way for me. Thanks for looking!"

This is basically the 5.56 NATO version of the AK-47.

As I understand, it suffers from a common issue with this type of AK. Specifically, good magazines are hard to come by and as a result, it doesn't like to feed well. I've not shot it so I can only relay what was told to me in that one of the magazines works ok, but the other doesn't work as well. I know the guy I got it from put rounds through it and told me it fired fine (except for the feeding problem on the one magazine).

Email me with questions and I'll answer what I can.

This comes with what you see - the rifle, 2 magazines, the ""oil"" can and the original manual.

I'm asking $325 FTF in the Toledo area, but I'm willing to drive a reasonable distance (about 30 minutes or so). I would also be interested in using it as a partial trade for a Gen 3 Glock 19 or 1911's.

And I can not bring myself to pay $7 a box when I can get it at Aim in bulk for $4.50. The only glitch I've found w/ this gun is the pistol grip has the slightest of play in it. When I had it stripped apart to clean it up, I did not have the right size allen head to try tightening it. I've put 25 rounds through it. The Guy before me stated he'd put between 500 and 800.

Here is the information from Galco's web site : The F.L.E.T.C.H.T high ride holster is one of Galco's most popular designs.

Its unique two-piece construction is contoured on the body side to the natural curve of the hip, keeping all the molding on the front of the holster, allowing for significantly more comfortable carry and a narrower profile than an ordinary pancake type holster*. 

Hand-molded to fit specific handguns, the F.L.E.T.C.H. features a reinforced thumb break for security, combat grip accessibility for speed, double-stitched seams for durability, and covered trigger guard for safety. The retention strap configuration is specific to individual firearms types, and varies depending on firearm model. The F.L.E.T.C.H. is constructed of premium saddle leather and made to fit belts up to 1 3/4"". 

Made for semiautomatic pistols and double-action revolvers, the F.L.E.T.C.H. is available in right or left hand designs in tan or black finish."

The original architecture for the Detonics Combat Master began in the 1960's with an Explosives Corporation of America (EXCOA) engineer named Pat Yates. Through this association, Yates met with a number of other gun enthusiasts in the early 70's, including Sid Woodcock. These meetings led to the development of the original prototypes for the Combat Master. In the middle of the decade, Mike Maes, a manager with EXCOA and Sid Woodcock formalized their collaborative work and began what is the 30 year history of Detonics.

Pat Yates now had an opportunity to fully develop his compact 1911 design. Over the course of a few short years, the Combat Master was developed, tested and put into production in 1976. In the early 1980s, Detonics released both the Service Master and Score Master weapons as their equivalents to the mid-sized Colt Commander and full-sized Government Model, respectively.

In 1987 Detonics was purchased by Bruce McCaw of McCaw Cellular. The company was renamed New Detonics with operations managed by Robbie Barkman of ROBAR. During this period, New Detonics was moved to Phoenix, Arizona where operations continued until closing in 1992.

In 2004 New Detonics reappeared as Detonics USA under the guidance of Jerry Ahern. Ahern was the fan of the original Combat Master pistol and in response to concealed-carry laws being passed since the early 1990s, the resurrected Detonics USA saw the reintroduction of the Combat Master to the general public. Operations were moved to Pendergrass, Georgia, where the first significant additions to the product line were made with the Street Master, a full size slide on a Combat Master frame and the commemorative, full size 9-11-01.

In November 2007, ownership of Detonics USA and all of its predecessors was purchased by Bruce Siddle and Dr. Steve Stahle. Lt. Col. Dave Grossman (Ret.) bought into the company and became a board member in October 2008. Now known only as Detonics, corporate operations were relocated to Millstadt, IL.

The original architecture for the Detonics Combat Master began in the 1960's with an Explosives Corporation of America (EXCOA) engineer named Pat Yates. Through this association, Yates met with a number of other gun enthusiasts in the early 70's, including Sid Woodcock. These meetings led to the development of the original prototypes for the Combat Master. In the middle of the decade, Mike Maes, a manager with EXCOA and Sid Woodcock formalized their collaborative work and began what is the 30 year history of Detonics.

Pat Yates now had an opportunity to fully develop his compact 1911 design. Over the course of a few short years, the Combat Master was developed, tested and put into production in 1976. In the early 1980s, Detonics released both the Service Master and Score Master weapons as their equivalents to the mid-sized Colt Commander and full-sized Government Model, respectively.

In 1987 Detonics was purchased by Bruce McCaw of McCaw Cellular. The company was renamed New Detonics with operations managed by Robbie Barkman of ROBAR. During this period, New Detonics was moved to Phoenix, Arizona where operations continued until closing in 1992.

In 2004 New Detonics reappeared as Detonics USA under the guidance of Jerry Ahern. Ahern was the fan of the original Combat Master pistol and in response to concealed-carry laws being passed since the early 1990s, the resurrected Detonics USA saw the reintroduction of the Combat Master to the general public. Operations were moved to Pendergrass, Georgia, where the first significant additions to the product line were made with the Street Master, a full size slide on a Combat Master frame and the commemorative, full size 9-11-01.

In November 2007, ownership of Detonics USA and all of its predecessors was purchased by Bruce Siddle and Dr. Steve Stahle. Lt. Col. Dave Grossman (Ret.) bought into the company and became a board member in October 2008. Now known only as Detonics, corporate operations were relocated to Millstadt, IL.

More stuff and better quality = more money. That being said I know they were $70 not too long ago and I see plenty selling on GBroker at 230+ and I'd still like a decent deal. If you want to send me what you've got and the price you want I'd be more than happy to consider it though.

Damaged/Fix 'em up guns considered as well, I can do lots of my own repair work including the firing pins, springs, rollers. If you're not sure what it is I won't know if I can fix it so cost will be effected. Or missing parts, I can get a new barrel, frame, slide or many other alternative parts if you have the majority for a good cost.

The Stainless Steel revolver has 8 3/8"" barrel.

I have acquired this revolver in a trade, but I have decided to let it go.

I was told that it shot very little, and I have no reason to doubt that.

There is only a faint ring around the cylinder. The cylinder locks up tight. The bore looks clean.

I will throw in a Hunter (Picture below) cowboy leather holster along with 6rds of ammo. .

It will come in a hard case.

The revolver looks and functions perfect, only blemish on the revolver is tap markings (bottom photo) on top of the barrel, where the old scope used to be before it was replaced by Leupold.

Leupold scope is M8-2 X EXTENDED ER. (It has some scratches and dings on the outer surface, but the lenses are in good shape and function 100%.)"

The legendary 45 ACP combines stellar reliability and exceptional accuracy with proven big-bore stopping power. The FNP-45 offers a light yet ergonomic polymer frame with low bore axis for reduced felt recoil and improved control. The FNP-45 USG's grip design accommodates magazines holding up to 15 rounds, making it ideal for both practical shooting competition and personal security. The stainless steel slide has front and rear cocking serrations and the 4.5"" hammer-forged stainless steel barrel delivers pinpoint accuracy. Every FNP is made in the USA. It has interchangeable grips,  you can see in the picture, so anyone can comfortably handle this pistol.

This 150 fired through it and you would never know from looking at it.  It comes with 4 clips one of which is a 15 rd. The extra clip is made by FN ansd was not cheap. I will also include three boxes of Federal Premium Ammo if it sells for asking price. and 16 self defense bullets.  This gun blows the XD out of the water. Plus its holds 16 rounds! This gun looks better and performs better than everything in its class. I tried them all before deciding on this pistol. I bought it new from a dealer and had to order it.  The recoil for this gun is unlike any .45 i have ever shot.  The balance is impeccable.

A little history:
As WWII began to heat up, the government stepped up procurement of various weapons for the war effort, including a series of orders in 1941-42 for about 5,000 Official Police revolvers destined for defense plant guard duty, security officers of various government bureaus, and Military police use.   
Colt responded by introducing the ""Commando"", which was manufactured with either a two or four inch barrel, and non-gloss Parkerized matte blued finish. The Commando also lacked the usual metal checkering on the hammer, trigger, and cylinder latch, as well as the reflection-deadening treatment of the commercial version's top strap. In addition, plastic material replaced the wood grips of the civilian model. Altogether approximately 48,611 Commando war-time models were eventually acquired through mid-1945, most were supplied for sentry and police type functions, although around 12,800 were issued to various intelligence services such as US Military intelligence and the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), usually in the two inch barrel configuration referred to as the ""Junior Commando"". A few Commandos saw service overseas in the war zone."

I have a very nice S/42 Luger rig that I am looking to sell to fund another purchase.  This came from a local vet estate here in Newark.  There is a little pitting and bluing wear from being in the holster. I haven't taken it apart, but all exterior numbers match.

The mags are not serial number marked, but do have a 1937 waffenamt stamp on each.  

The holster is dated 1917 and is in good shape for its age.  There is slight separation starting, but other than that its in pretty good shape.

I am asking 1500.00 for this rig.  I will accept partial trades for a nice all matching K98 bolt action German Mauser.  Sorry, but I'm not interested in anything import marked or any RC guns. I am into WWII and Vietnam arms with original capture papers, so anything with capture papers would be of interest as well.

I have more pictures if there is anything else you would like to see on the pistol.

Hello,
I have a Dillon 650 that I bought about 8 months ago that is like new, some of it is still new in the box. This is my second Dillon machine (Previously owned a 550) and think very highly of them both. I really like the 650 but with the volume of ammo I am wanting to load down the road I almost feel like I should have sprung for the Dillon Super 1050. I am willing to part with my ""like new - lifetime No BS warranty"" 650 and all of its accessories at 20% below list. I will not part it out and you will have to buy all of my 650 stuff that I can't use on the 1050, but you get a bargain. As you know if you have been shopping - Dillion is real quality and you can't find it lower than list.

It can be used for home defense using 45 Colts. I'd crap myself if I was staring down this barrel. Colt didn't call his gun ""the peacemaker"" for nothing! And because it's chambered for 454 it will digest the hottest 45 Colts you can feed it.
