I have a permit to carry and cash and am willing to travel.  I've seen the highly inflated prices people have things posted for on here and on Gun Broker.  I understand that I am looking at paying a premium, but I also see unrealistic prices listed on stuff.  I've also seen those guns not selling so be realistic when selling your $399 MSRP rifle.  Let me know what you have and we'll go from there."

Specs:

The XD-S is a single-stack compact pistol chambered in .45ACP. The overall length is 6.3” with a slim width of only 1”. Empty weight is a light 21.5 ounces, partially due to its light polymer frame construction. Standard capacity is 5+1 rounds. A new and welcome addition to the XD-S pistol is the red fiber

Caliber:

One of the most exciting features of the XD-S is the fact that it was designed around the .45ACP cartridge, which is arguably one of the best self-defense rounds available.

XD-S Features:

The XD-S is equipped with the Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System which is designed to prevent accidental discharges due to dropping or bumping the gun. The trigger will not operate unless direct rearward pressure is applied to the face of the trigger.

All XD series pistols include a grip safety which only allows firing when the grip safety is depressed.

What’s In the Box?

Springfield Armory has always done an outstanding job of equipping the XD series pistols with most of the accessories needed to get started. The XD-S is no exception to this rule. The XD-S comes complete in a high quality storage case suitable for air travel. Contained within you will find a paddle holster, a double magazine pouch, a cable lock, two extra fiber optics (one red, one green), an interchangeable back strap, and two 5 round magazines."

But I'm in a position where I need to pick up a quality build for a REASONABLE price. Don't get me wrong, I know you want to make a buck, but at the same time I'm a fellow shooter, not someone who is going to turn this around a relist. Need to replace my Armalite Super Sass that is out of commission..thus here I am.

So i'm looking for a Hogan/POF, REPR, or a 308 build that utilizes Noveske, Mega and other quality parts with a 16"" barrel. Optics are optional, if you have it great, if not no worries. A plus if you have a Pelican 1650 to get rid of as well.

Depending on the build I'm in between $2500-3k for purchase. If you have a safe queen that is just sitting around and you want to help a fellow marksman without gouging him, I'm your guy. Let me know what you have, all emails replied to. Not looking for generic DPMS builds (sporticals, oracles) or a Sig build (good luck trying to get Magpul to play nice with the 716's).

Shot count doesn't matter for the barrel as long as the rifle has been maintained. If you're build has upper/lower wobble..i'm not interested. Thanks for reading"

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.  Stand up for what you believe in and spread the word!"

Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.  Stand up for what you believe in and spread the word!"

Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people. Don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.  Stand up for what you believe in and spread the word!"

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people. Don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people. Don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.  Stand up for what you believe in and spread the word!"

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people. Don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.  Stand up for what you believe in and spread the word!"

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people. Don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.  Stand up for what you believe in and spread the word!"

Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people. Don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people. Don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people. Don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.  Stand up for what you believe in and spread the word!"

Lots of add ons and runs MOA groups at 100 with black hills 77gr and just over moa with Privi partizan Match 75gr.  Wife says it has to go as It more or a safe queen.  1/7 twist cold hammer forged barrel and is very accurate. This is one of the early few that were made with swiss internal parts and is no longer made in this configuration. Bought it new at Academy for 1700 +tax. I have added a Troy battlerail and got rid of the cheaper factory quad rail. I have also added a Griffin Tactical charging handle, Magpul OD green CTR stock with cheek riser, OD green ladder rail protectors, ARMS poly flip up back up sights, Magpul Trigger guard, swiss push take down pins,  CAA receiver sling adapter ( mainly to fill the gap between the stock and receiver when the stock is fully collapsed ) and 2 OD green 30rd high capacity magpul PMAGS. I have only put 150 rounds through it. It does have a few very minor scuffs in a couple spots but nothing major. I have a little over 2500 not inot including tax in this rifle and its the best of both ar and ak worlds in my opinion. Accepts all AR style mags and AR butt stocks. Feel free to ask any questions. No mark up or price goughing here will take 2250.00. If you would like the rifle without the extra stuff just the rifle, troy battle rail, and factory sig 30rd magazine ill take 1800.00. Might trade for a few things: Wilson combat 1911 or other high end 1911's depending on model. Might consider others things but Cash is King. feel free to email me or text me at 405 Three one 4 - 7 Four O seven. I prefer FTF at H&H gun range or Bass Pro shop but let me know where is best for you.

Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people. Don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.  Stand up for what you believe in and spread the word!"

For those of us who have had more than one transaction on this great site, the good out weighs the crack pots.
I have conducted numerous transactions trading/buying/ selling with fellow enthusiasts on Armslist without one issue or complaint of "" being rude"", or disrespectful. 

However, I will not accept or tolerate for someone to call me a ""irresponsible gun owner"" because I would not reply to:
"" I know your gun is worth $400, I will give you $150 cash""
"" I have a Jennings .25 with uncle miles holster trade you even""
""Trade you my Seiko, needs battery""
"" Poulan chainsaw""

So, to all of you that did not get a response from the above. Oh well...
Also, to the guy who texted me 10 times to meet you at 5:00 pm at Walmart, I waited 
20 minutes!! Oh well...  
Also, the guy who drove 45 minutes to meet me, and refused to sign a bill, I know you were pissed, all you had to do was sign it, or show me your HCP. Oh well...

""Buyer beware"" right... we should start a post ""seller beware"" of trolls like yourself.
Our rights are sacred and being questioned daily. 
People like you who cry foul for no reason need to stay to the left, or go troll Craigslist for things that go bang.

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people. Don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.  Stand up for what you believe in and spread the word!"

The X-PRE is the Huldra flagship rifle. Combining the patented piston technology with a solid monolithic billet upper receiver and forearm, a 416 stainless steel fluted barrel, and the Adams Arm compensator, giving you the fastest, most stable and accurate rifle in your arsenal. This upper was designed with the precision and 3-gun shooter in mind. The mid-length gas system gives you a longer sight radius between the rear and front sight for quicker sight acquisition and a more ergonomic feel. The monolithic upper was designed specifically for this rifle. The monolithic tube is fluted to dissipate heat quicker than any other receiver and is extended around the gas block for a smoother look and better balance. It is extremely accurate, has virtually no muzzle rise, and is quick and balanced for anyone in the competition arena. 

The 4.5 pound JP Trigger (a $259.95 value) gives you a perfectly crisp, precise break and extremely short reset. The complete absence of take-up and over-travel provides the best combination of speed and precision on the market. The ambidextrous safety allows you to flip off the safety on either side of the weapon. The rugged Mil-Spec Vltor IMod Stock has an extremely comfortable Superior cheek weld with a non-slip removable butt pad. Each side compartment of the Vltor IMod can hold two AA or three lithium CR123 3-volt batteries and accepts a push-button, quick detachable sling swivel. The Ergo Grip is solid and comfortable. Its superior texture reduces slippage, even while wearing gloves and is virtually impervious to oils and solvents. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical tooling dimensions held within ±.001” and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control.

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people. Don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.  Stand up for what you believe in and spread the word!"

I have done extensive testing with the 307 GNR and it performs flawlessly. The 284 GNR works fine, but some of the shorter lighter weight 7mm bullets are hard to find these days so only preliminary testing has been done on it. As more and more 7mm bullets become available I will be doing more testing on it. The 307 GNR will be a bit more power than the 300 GNR plus you don't have to do the cutting, trimming and such that is required on the 300 GNR. The downside is that a Ruger stretch frame revolver is required for the conversion. The good thing is that the Ruger 357 Maximum revolvers are easier to get and cheaper than in recent past."

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people. Don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.

In January, Senator Feinstein will introduce a bill to stop the sale, transfer, importation and manufacturing of military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition feeding devises.

Summary of 2013 legislation

Following is a summary of the 2013 legislation:

 Bans the sale, transfer, importation, or manufacturing of:
 ◦120 specifically-named firearms
 ◦Certain other semiautomatic rifles, handguns, shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine and have one military characteristic
 ◦Semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds

•Strengthens the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban and various state bans by:
 ◦Moving from a 2-characteristic test to a 1-characteristic test
 ◦Eliminating the easy-to-remove bayonet mounts and flash suppressors from the characteristics test
 ◦Banning firearms with “thumbhole stocks” and “bullet buttons” to address attempts to “work around” prior bans

•Bans large-capacity ammunition feeding devices capable of accepting more than 10 rounds.
 •Protects legitimate hunters and the rights of existing gun owners by:
 ◦Grandfathering weapons legally possessed on the date of enactment
 ◦Exempting over 900 specifically-named weapons used for hunting or sporting purposes and
 ◦Exempting antique, manually-operated, and permanently disabled weapons

•Requires that grandfathered weapons be registered under the National Firearms Act, to include:

◦Background check of owner and any transferee;
 ◦Type and serial number of the firearm;
 ◦Positive identification, including photograph and fingerprint;
 ◦Certification from local law enforcement of identity and that possession would not violate State or local law; and
 ◦Dedicated funding for ATF to implement registration

The best two words to describe our AK 30rd magazine: ""rugged"" and ""reliable."" The reinforced composite material prevents corrosion while the heavy duty spring and anti-tilt follower ensure that every round will feed perfectly. Fits in the AK-47 using 7.62 x 39mm ammunition. When your Kalashnikov is thirsting for a magazine that can handle a beating, no questions asked, the INTRAFUSE® 30rd AK Magazine is the only logical choice. Not to mention that this magazine counts as 3 U.S. 922r compliant parts."

Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us.

This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people. Don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.

This freedom attacking act cannot be tolerated.  There are a reported 20,000 gun laws across this country but for some reason criminals today are still refusing to follow them.  Any new legislation to limit the firearms that you or I can legally purchase is simply an attack on us. We as a group are good, honest, law abiding citizens who are being punished for crimes that mentally unstable lone wolfs have committed.  This is guilty by association when we as good Americans don’t associate with these criminals in the first place.

Now is the time to stand up for the rights that are guaranteed to us as Law abiding citizens in the constitution.  Apparently there are a few in DC who don’t understand the guaranteed part and need to be reminded.  On January 19th at noon local time, there will be a gathering of 2nd amendment supporters at the state capitols.  This is a polite gathering to make our stance known to lawmakers.  Dress nicely and bring your friends and family!  Show the country that gun owners are normal, polite, and respectful people. Don’t be idle while the rights you are GUARANTEED to as an American are chipped away.  Every time a part of a right is taken away, it makes it easier for them to come back for more in the future.

I tried to look at the listings and mark my AR on the low side of what the rest of the guns were selling for. I hope I picked a reasonable price, if there is such a thing these days. If they get banned, maybe they will be worth 5 times as much. Who knows?

Anyway, this AR is lightly used, had the rail top, rear flip up sites, adjustable stock and the standard AR front.

I have more information on the gun and a lot of other assualt rifles listed at  www.Need4MoreGuns.com. Take a look there for more pictures and details as I don’t check my email associated with this account very much. I have other guns on this site as well, but I prefer www.Need4MoreGuns.com.
