The new CompM4s retains all the great features as the CompM4, but with the battery rotated to the lower right. This allows easier access the brightness control, and gives the optic a slimmer profile. Just like the CompM4, the enhanced energy-usage provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery. The crisp 2 MOA dot brightness has 16 positions, 9 daylight and 7 optimized for use with all night vision, especially Gen-3 night-vision technology in current government use. Aimpoint's band-pass coating on the front lens reflects select frequencies of red light at near 100% efficiency in order to give the highest possible dot brightness. The front lens opening is threaded for addition of a KillFlash® anti-reflective device. Please do your homework on this before making a ridiculous offer. Will send pics upon request thanks an have a blessed day."

I am a private re-loader and prepper interested in purchasing brass, projectiles, powder, primers and possibly dies/presses and ammo at a reasonable price from private sellers. I don't wish to deal with dealers or pay their asking prices (They generally have 100% profit built in). If a dealer is selling 1k 30 06 brass delivered for $.16/ea ... I will typically not pay more than $.08-10/ea delivered.  I want a fair deal, if I did not, I'd buy directly from a dealer. I also prefer volume (100+ brass, etc.) the more the better and recommend US Postal Service flat-rate shipping. Shipping kills many deals.  If you have multiple items and want to sell it as a lot, let me know what you have and I'll give you my offer. This way you get rid of your stuff quickly and convert it to cash... otherwise try to get top dollar and wait and wait and wait, your choice and good luck. I can pay by various methods: money order, personal check (if you accept), paypal.
What I need now is stuff for:  .38, .357, .45ACP, .44mag & Colt, .454 Casull, S&W460, .308 & 7.62 x 51, .270, and 30 06. I am always interested in powders, primers and even loaded ammo. Reloadable brass only! No berden primed, steel or aluminum cartridges!

The rifle sits nicely on its bi-pod and comes equipped with a Bushnell 6-24x40 mounted on Leupold rings.  I have everything that came with it from the factory (one 5-round magazine, box, booklets, tool, etc.).  I carry it in a hard plastic case (pictured) which is included in the sale.  I am also throwing in 50 rounds of Match ammo to sweeten the deal.

Pardus Collapsible Stock for M4 styled AR rifles from DPMS Panther Arms. Looks to be in new condition, has sling swivel and integral slots for sling attachments. Reason why Im selling is because I dont like the ergonomics of this stock. Please note that this is a Commercial spec stock and NOT a Mil-spec, so it wont fit on Colt made buffer extensions. Everywhere else online seems to sell these for over 50 bucks and thats not including tax and shipping.

2. Typical steel Beretta 92FS Magazine with a 15rnd capacity. Condition is new (Never been inserted in the gun). All Blued with White mag follower and plastic base plate that has the PB logo on it. Side of the mag reads, ""PB Cal.9 Para Made in Italy"". I no longer have a Beretta so I have no use for the mag. I discovered this brand new mag after cleaning out my closet so it never went with the Beretta that I sold a while back.

1. Ruger .357 SS SP101 with 2 inch barrel. Excellent smaller frame, ideal for CCW. This is simillar in size to the J frame S&W's. I have owned both, and prefer the Ruger. 5 shots of the amazingly powerfull .357 Magnum! Original, unmodified gun. Less than 100 rounds down the pipe. Stock everything. Retail $659

2. 4 speed loaders. Two are HKS, and two are Safariland. These work perfect, and are ideal for keeping extra rounds with you. Retail (all 4 total) $55

3. Blackhawk IWB leather holster. Made for this gun, and fits like a dream. Worn about 10 days, no signs of wear. Retail $60

4. I have ammo included. 25 rounds of Critical Defense .357 Magnum. 100 rounds of Wichester WB .38 special.  50 rounds of .357, not WB but cannot remember right now, sitting in the safe. Retail for all over $80

5. Soft zipper case for gun storage. Retail $20?


Save over $150 buying new, and get all these extras. These prices do not include the tax I paid. Excellent shooter, and very easy to conceal. Perfect for ladies, or new CCW holders, or????

Rifle has Weaver 20 MOA extended base, Warne rings, Tactical Operations buttstock pouch and Blackhawk bipod.  The scope is a Weaver Super Slam 3-15x50 with duplex reticle.  The rifle came from the factory with a H-S Precision stock with a full aluminum bedding block.  This rifle consistently shoots half MOA or better anywhere from 100-300 yards.  I've never shot it further than 300 yards because that's as far as my range can accomodate.  This isn't idle talk when I say that this is without a doubt the most accurate rifle I've ever shot or owned.  If you'd like to give it a try for yourself then you're welcome to come by and we will take her out for a test drive.  I live near Chattanooga in Jasper TN.

I've got $1500 invested in this rig.  I think that it's worth more but I will take $1350 OBO for it.  As I stated previously this is a very accurate rifle.  If you're looking for something that will cut holes together consistently at 100 yards and that won't let you down at long range then you've found it.  I'm also interested in trades for AR 15s.  My main motivation for selling this rig is that I am wanting to get back into an assault rifle style weapon.  I accept postal money orders (real postal money orders not cashier's checks) and I will also accept DISCREET paypal.  Shipping costs are on you and I will charge ACTUAL shipping cost for ground shipping and insurance.  If we work a trade out then I will cover shipping the rifle to you fully insured as long as you return the favor."

Starts, runs, idols and drives in 2 wheel and in 4 wheel GREAT!! 

It has a 350ci engine, auto trans, 203 transfer case with shaft kit for part time four wheel, DANA 44 rear, 14 bolt front with full floater 8 lug axles. The transfer case was rebuilt when the shaft kit was installed. The shaft kit allows the NP203 transfer case to now have 5 positions. High, High Lock, Low, Low Lock and Neutral. There are no hubs to mess with or anything. Everything is done from the drivers seat. The engine bottom and top end was recently rebuilt and it has a new Edelbrock Performer intake with new Holly 600 carb. The muffler and tailpipe was recently replaced as it was stock. It has rust spots and patched holes and the body has a lot of dents. The truck only really rusted in the common areas for that year model. The cab corners are completely solid, the floor pans have very little rust and are still very solid for being original. The hood mounts are in great shape, the hood opens and closes without any problems. This truck was used as a farm/woods truck for and is by no means a show piece but mechanically is in great shape. Could easily be used as a daily driver. All of the glass is there, no cracks or chips. It also has new shocks, fuel pump, battery, plugs, and wires. It is on 35"" tires that have about 30% tread left. Breaks were done about 2000 miles ago. Headlights (high and low beam), wipers and dash lights work great. Transmission shifts very well and does not slip or stick. 

Aside from looks, this truck is very mechanically sound. The only thing that does not work is the radio. I have the original title and it is registered and insured in my name. I drive it to work and back a couple times a week just for fun.

Bed is diamond plate steel covered, and the rear bumper is new.

Great opportunity if you have a LCP but the recoil of the .380 is too much in that small package. I have shot both side by side and the recoil is much more manageable on the P32 than the LCP. I originally purchased this gun for my GF but she prefers her revolver so I have been using it as a back up gun, but I would prefer to carry a .380 since I am not too sensitive to the recoil. The factory sights were white on the gun but I found they would blend together when shooting, so I painted the front sight orange and the rear sight green which allows for a more consistent and repeatable sight picture and increased accuracy.

I have the original factory KelTec soft pouch, and manual. The gun and factory magazine and 3 additional factory magazines that cost $20 each. Also including 2 50rd boxes of 73gr FMJ ammo and a 20rd box of Federal Hydrashok hollow point ammo. Will trade everything straight across for a Ruger LCP with 1 mag. Will add cash if you have more than 2 mags. Will also consider trading for a Ruger LC9. Not interested in anything else in trade.
