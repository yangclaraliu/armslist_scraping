This reticle is very useful because you can log on to the www.nikonhunting.com and launch their spot on application that lets you choose the make and weight of your ammunition and it will tell you exactly where your bullet will hit at each range for any wind and temperature situation.  Also included are 20 rounds of 75 grain ultramax match hollow point .223 ammunition that are great for hunting and also very accurate (the rounds I used to shoot the grouping in the picture). Also included are 320 rounds of American Eagle Rifle Ammo .223 REM 55GR.FMJ that are due to arrive by mail tomorrow. This is a very nice rifle that I am very proud of. The reason I am getting rid of it is that due to the current political climate their value has increased so much that I cannot pass this up. I got engaged approximately two weeks ago so money has suddenly become a big issue, or I would be holding on to this weapon. The listed price is somewhat negotiable. By the way, the grouping in the picture was shot from approximately 50 yards with 8 shots. The one bullet hole that hit high and to the left of the bullseye next to the number 10 was the first cold bore shot. If that hole is not included in the grouping, then the next 7 shots formed a grouping approximately 7/16's of an inch wide from outside to outside. This would be 7/8's of an inch at a hundred yards, a sub moa grouping."

Immaculate Condition/ Beautifully Polished & Blued/ Gorgeous Target Grips/ Target Hammer & Trigger/ Red Ramp Front Sight & White Outline Rear Sight!
 All the bells & whistles on S&Ws rarest barrel length, the Four Inch .357 Magnum 27-2.
This gun is in top condition yet I won't say that it was never fired after leaving Springfield, Mass., because it has had very light use (not by me), and was adult owned all of it's 'life'.
 This gun is not for the average person: But if you know your 20th Century Smiths, you know what you're lookin' at. 
 I've had 'conversations' with a young kid that decided to open up a gun shop once about the scarcest factory barrel length ever used on S&W model 27s & don't think that I really convinced him at the time that the 4"" was it. While it's true that many of S&Ws most popular revolvers were commonly made with the the 4"" barrel, the Model 27s certainly were not.
 If you are still reading this, I bet ya knew that already.
 This is a true American Sweetheart as far as older revolvers go. A Classic S&W with everthing going for it & a class act all around."

This rifle has an A4 upper receiver (detachable carry handle included) with forward assist, A2 fixed stock, rifle length gas system, no bayo-lug or muzzle threads so this is ban state compliant.  It's all factory built, no modifications or changes to the firing system or manual of arms at all.

The front sight is a ""cross hair"" ring design target sight.
This rifle is in outstanding condition and has a very low round count (approximately 40-50 rounds since I've owned it and it appeared unfired when I bought it).  The only marks on the rifle are a 4 small scrapes in the finish of the barrel from the previous owner attaching a slip on muzzle device (see pictures) and a small brass smudge on the shell deflector.  It's very accurate at varying ranges and has functioned flawlessly for me in the limited use its gotten.  Armorer owned and very well taken care of.

Schwinn Collegiate Female $179
Hi my name is Nick and I am selling a vintage Schwinn Lady’s Collegiate. It has a 26inch wheel diameter and it measures 22 inches from seat post to crank. I believe it is from the 1970s judging by what I have seen online. I just cleaned it and a it look really nice. I would guess that the rims are chromed and I used some wd-40 and polished them to a shine. I put a low of elbow grease into cleaning the metal crank and it also looks like new. I didn’t have time to clean the chrome on the handle bars and fenders but anyone can clean it with a little chrome cleaner and elbow grease. The bike is entirely unmolested with factory grips, factory SEAT with original cork and springs. It even had factory wheels on it. The bike has 3 speeds and it still shifts pretty well but it would be perfect with a cheap fix at any bicycle shop could do. The bike was built in Chicago and the original Schwinn badge on the front post of the bike is still visible and in great shape. I have seen this same bike selling for 220 but that is before you have to pay for shipping and handling, and then pay a fee to paypal. Price is negotiable but please no low ballers.

Craftsman Electric Mower 48 volt $299
Hi my name is Nick and I am selling a LIKE NEW Craftsman electric lawn mower. The mower is only 1 season old and was only used 4 times,  don’t worry I charged it 7/24/12 and tested it and it still runs powerful, holds a charge, and recharges. The mower is a 48 volt and comes with original manual and recharger, on missing the baggage collector but the mulch insert is inside the mower; why bag anyway it’s better to fertilize your grass with the blades and then no more pain in the butt hauling of grass clippings. The mower originally cost $500 and that is before you have to pay another 40 for taxes. Why worry about the rising gas prices when you can mow your lawn for a fraction of the price with this electric mower. The mower does not have a motor to move it forward in order to save energy and conserve batter power so you have to push the mower to propel it but that is no big deal, it is light enough for a anyone to push and operate it. The blade is 19inches wide and is still shape, just cut grass when testing it 7/24/12. Check it out at Craftsman’s webside http://www.craftsman.com/shc/s/p_10155_12602_REDACTED0P?sid=comm_craftsman_reviews    Price is negotiable but please no low ballers.

Thank God Santa is still doing well,( I saw him shopping at Henry's Gun Shop in Yukon on the 22nd, I think it was).
 In fact; things are so bad these days, that I haven't even seen a danged Unicorn around here for Ages! Come to think of it; I have NEVER seen a real live Oklahoma Unicorn, or even a one horned cow that I can remember without working up a sweat.
The best that I can come up with these days is a really nice Unicorn Skull, (without the jaw).
 The Skull is fairly weathered, and it appears that Mr. Unicorn may have in fact, passed away some time ago. 
I really suspect that this belonged to one of a small herd of the last of the 'EuroCorns', so it may even be an older Import (possibly Belgian?).
Even if there ever WERE any migratory heards of out of town Unicorns that frollicked & gabolled & chased butterflys across the glaciers to what is now North America back during the last Ice Age or whatever- I'll bet that they were quickly devoured by Giant Prehistoric Buffahumpalos, or other such carnivorous ruminants that are now as extinct as they are.
  Anyway....I'm willing to trade a perfectly good Museum Quality Unicorn Skull for other perfectly good stuff, like perhaps a perfectly good quality firearm (Belgian?). Or ammo. Or maybe just a freeze dried Leprachaun; (but no cheap Chinese knock-offs)!
 This skull looks it's best when hanging from a nice high wall & surrounded by genuine Antique Battle & Courtier's Swords (SOLD SEPARATELY).
Just think of the possumbilities! This old skull would make a dandy conversation piece for any fortress or man cave, or a great mascot for your business...or just to show liberals that nothing lasts forever."

Sources say that only 975 of these rifles were imported into the U.S. and they are the rarest of the FN-49 variants. 
I am listing this for a friend who is rural and without internet service. You can call Ken directly at REDACTED. 
I will check email but will still direct you to call him at the above number.
 After a 5 minute google search I discovered just how rare these are and saw them selling for over $800 back in 2001! These are highly desrired and few in number. I doubt you will see another for sale.
You can complete your FN collection with this rifle today for only $1,000!"

I have also installed a forward grip picatinny rail system.

The gun is in excellent working condition, very accurate and obviously with the .308 cartridge very powerful.  With the right ammo and skills this easily could exceed 300 yards very accurately.  The charging handle has marred up the charging grove, but this is normal wear for these actions.

I have put less than 100 rounds through it, and my friend that I bought it from had used it less than 100 rounds.  All in all, it is in great shape.  I have decided to just keep my bolt action rifle for my .308 rounds.  I have a couple of AR's for .223 so I don't need any semi-auto .308's.

I repurposed some money into AR's and need to part with one of my Wilson's to fund them. Up for sale today is a very lightly used Wilson Combat CQB with about 150 rounds through it. I've got a CQB Elite so decided to move this since I bought a few ARs with all of the AWB talk. This gun is black over black Armor Tuff that has absolutely no visible wear. This gun was shot MAYBE 150 times, cleaned, lubed and has been in my safe. It had no FTFs or FTEs during the 150 rounds and is like the day it was made. This gun was made in 7/2012 and was purchased by me brand new at Colonial Shooting Academy in Richmond, VA in 8/2012. This gun comes with a total of four Wilson Magazines (2x 47Ds 2x ETMs) and all original paperwork. This gun plus extra magazines, flat wire upgrade, tax etc was over $3000.00. You can have everything listed here for $2500.00 delivered. I will accept cashiers check, USPS money order or cash. Please let me know if you have any questions. 


This CQB comes with the following items/upgrades: 

Flat Wire Recoil Spring

If you know anything about these guns then you know this guns sells itself, as its heritage and reputation greatly precedes it. This was made when Remington still handmade their guns, try to find a handmade shotgun anywhere near what you can buy these for. The marking show it was made in Jan. of 1936, these came with the rarer checkered stocks which add to their value as well. Its one of the few shotguns that has good old vintage looks, yet performs better than many modern ones, and every bit as well-made and reliable as the classic Model 12. They are great shotguns and, very under-rated, at least for now, get these before they start going up in price. These are getting harder and harder to find, especially in good working condition. I have seen these sell for $150-$600 and even more for ones in mint condition. I will try to get up Pics asap so you can see

It is in great working condition, the action is very smooth. Nothing is broken or wrong with this shotgun, it is good to go and ready to shoot. I see NO RUST at all on the gun, and it looks as if most all the bluing is still there! This has been carefully stored, and looks to be well taken care of over its life. I will be posting up pictures of it tonight, as well as one or two other rifles. In this condition and being an early model I am asking on the low end so I can sell it somewhat quickly. I have seen them go for much more in this condition.

 For sale is a Remington 700 PSS (Police Sharp Shooter) chambered in .308, with H-S Precision stock, heavy barrel, and Parkerized finish. I purchsed this rifle new here in Columbus about 8 years ago for over $750 (still have the reciept and manual.)
The rifle is in virtually brand new condition, with no scratches or dings. I shot it occasionally the first year I had it down at the Fort Benning Rifle & Pistol Club, then put it away for the last several years. It's had maybe 200 rounds through it. The crown and bore are pristine.
The PSS has been in use with countless law enforcement agencies across the United States, and the H-S Precision fiberglass/kevlar stock is virtually identical to the one used on the U.S. Army's M24 sniper rifle,according to this review from snipercountry:
http://www.snipercountry.com/inreviews/remington700pss.asp
Also included is a Doscocil locking hard case and about 100 rounds of ammo ( about 2.5 boxes of Federal Amercan Eagle, about 1/2 box of Federal Gold medal match ammo, a box of NATO-spec South African surplus, and 20 rounds of Georgia Arms soft point (hunting ammo).
The rifle also has Leupold standard scope bases installed ( just needs a pair of Leupold standard rings)
I've priced this to sell, and to avoid any haggling, so $600,firm. Thanks......

This is a ""Pre-Series 70"" pistol, was made in 1966. The National Match is the competition/target version of the famous 1911/Government Model line. Chambered for the .45 ACP it had some features that were unique at the time. These features included the flat top slide with angled cocking serrations, Elliason adjustable rear sight, specially fitted barrel bushing, NM barrel, conical recoil spring plug, special trigger, etc. This pistol is in excellent overall condition. There are a few light handling marks scattered about, but no rust or pitting. I'd grade the original blue finish at about 95-97%. The original checkered walnut grips feature gold Colt medallions and are in excellent shape without cracks, chips or significant wear. The pistol is in perfect working order and the bore is excellent. This fine pistol comes in an original National Match box, target and instruction sheet.  The last of the old style Pre-Series 70 National Match pistols was manufactured in 1970 at serial number 37025-NM.  I am asking $2000.00."
