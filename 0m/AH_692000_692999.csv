Marlin firearms decided to punch out of their comfort level in the 1990s with a bolt-action single shot heavy target rifle. Designed to compete with entry-level Remington Model 40 and Anschutz target rifles, the new Marlin gun was unlike anything ever made by the company. Designed with a 22-inch heavy barrel with a recessed match-style crown and matched chamber, the rifle was embedded in a distinctive blue ISU standard stock of a fiberglass/Kevlar (Carbelite) combination with a high comb, stippled forearm, and pistol grip. The stock had an adjustable butt plate for length of pull. 
Accuracy of these series is superb. In a February 1996 Gun Tests article, they wrote the following, ""The best the Marlin could do at 50 yards was 0.6-inch groups, which we shot with Eley Tenex. Three other ammo lots, CCI Green Tag Competition, Dynamit Nobel's RWS R50, and Lapua Dominator, averaged 0.7-inch groups. The 2000 didn't like Federal's Gold Medal Match rimfire ammo, shooting 0.9-inch groups."""

It needs to be safe to fire but beyond that I dont care. broken stalks rusted barrels you name it. As long as you can pull the trigger without blowing off your arm I want it. I will pay right around 50 for a single shot. 75 for a double. Id do 100 for a pump that cycled reliably. And honestly im not dishin out the kinda cash somebodys gonna want for a semi, but I could probably do 150 if it functions. I want to do this face to face. I live in eugene but I make trips to seattle and sante fe so,i could probably meet you in your city or we could arrange to meet half way. We'll do a bill of sale and you can have a photo copy of my I.d. If you'd like. Im really parshal to those old singleshot new england pardeners.

The weapon is media blasted and then we apply our zinc phosphate finish. Upon assembly the bolts and actions are then handfitted together providing you with the smoothest action possible. The original sights are then refitted to the weapon. The wood stocks are also stripped, oil stained and then hand waxed for the final finished surface. All weapons are then test fired and inspected for safety and quality upon delivery. The overall weapon is lighter, faster handling, and more accurate than the original rig.

Knights Armament SR-25 Rifle 20"" 308 762 NATO Enhanced Match (E.M.) Rifle has a nickel plated bolt, and combines some of the best characteristics from the combat proven MK11 MOD0 and the M110 military rifles. The E.M. Rifle's Free-Floating barrel is a clone of the legendary MK11 MOD0's, but its Upper Receiver Extending (URX) forend with integral folding front sight was developed for the Army's XM-110 Rifle. The E.M. Rifle's ambidextrous magazine release was also a noteworthy XM-110 feature and the lightweight butt-stock is the same as the MK11 MOD0's.

Hard to find! Make offer.

The FR7 and FR8 were introduced in the 1950s when the Spanish military was already implementing the CETME automatic rifle, but did not yet have sufficient inventory to equip and train all troops. The rifles were made from existing stockpiles of Mauser bolt-action rifles, the FR-7 from the rifle model 1919 Santa Barbara and the FR-8 from the 1943 Santa Barbara carbine. They were adjusted to the new NATO calibre 7.62×51mm and, being of a suitably compact built, the FR 8 was used well into the 1970s by mounted Guardia Civil units in the Sierra Nevada. The flash hider was designed to be compatible with NATO-standard rifle grenades. The under-barrel tube, which resembles the gas cylinder found on automatic weapons, actually serves as the bayonet mount and as storage for cleaning gear. The rear sight is an elevation-adjustable rotary type with aperatures for 200 m (220 yd), 300 m (330 yd) and 400 m (440 yd), as well as an open ""V"" notch for 100 metres (110 yd). The front sight is elevation-adjustable via a special tool. Operation is identical to the standard Mauser design."

The Remington Model 700™ VTR A-TACS is an extremely reliable and accurate rifle available in .308 Winchester only. This gun has a built in bipod stud for those of you into shooting from the prone position all you need is a bipod. THIS CAMO PATTERN IS BAD ASS! Why? It's A-Tacs camo and its created to absorb the surrounding light so it acts like a chameleon. How does this light absorption work? Leaves are green not because they are green...but because they themselves reflect that green light. All light spectrum's absorbed are not displayed for the most part. This camo works not on the same premise but on an opposite one. It absorbs the radiant light and in effect changes color to match the environment.

All in all it has a bad ass look and it is a accurate and reliable gun.

I myself have killed 2 Bucks out to 200 meters with it. One shot, One Kill!

Benelli’s revolutionary Vinci just got “supersized.” The much anticipated Super Vinci is designed to handle 3 1/2-inch Magnum loads. At the heart of the Super Vinci is the In-Line Inertia Driven system, designed to reliably chamber light 2 3/4-inch loads up through the most powerful 3 1/2-inch Magnums. 

The Super Vinci features Practical Speed Performance™ (PSP)—a matter of how fast you can shoulder the gun... acquire the target... shoot... and recover from recoil to prepare for the next shot.

Precise instruments developed by Benelli measures and creates graphs that illustrate the total recoil of the Super Vinci against its competitors. Other guns have a peak recoil that’s as much as 15 percent greater than the Super Vinci’s. But more significantly, the total felt-recoil of the competitors’ guns is as much as 22 percent more. Combine the In-Line Inertia Driven® action with superior balance, light weight, reduced recoil and minimal muzzle climb and the shooter experiences the real timeline of performance speed where the Super Vinci has no equal.

2001 honda civic LX 4 door
208k miles
5 speed manual transmission 
Great on Gas! averages 38-40 mpg on the highway, city is around 35.
Car runs and drives great, I bought it when I commuted 70 miles round trip to work every day and drove to visit family in Ohio frequently. Since then I have gotten a closer job and have another vehicle so I rarely drive this one. 

The good:
38-40 average mpg highway
Put in brand new battery last month
Rear tires are like new, 85% or better, front around 50%
Windshield wipers were replaced recently
Headliner was just replaced.
Runs and drives great, Engine and transmission are strong. needs nothing mechanically as far as I can tell.

The bad:
Car is 11 years old and shows signs of it, Interior is pretty good overall. I do not smoke but there is a cigarette burn in passenger seat and a few in the back seat from smoking passengers.
Drivers side sun visor has some tears in it, I saw a replacement pair on ebay for $70 but never got around to it.
There is a small dent in the passenger side fender, I tried to include it in the pictures but it is hard to see. 
Car sustained some hail damage from storm last year, it is fairly minor, not noticeable unless close to vehicle.
Air conditioner needs to be recharged, does not blow cold. 
Gas door release latch is broken, it stays shut and opens easily, but you must use something to open it such as quarter, key or credit card.(fingers too big for groove)
Passenger side rear window does not go down, I believe it needs a new switch, the other 3 windows work. 
There is a small rust bubble beginning to form on rear drivers wheel well. I noticed it A year ago and it has not progressed much since.


I tried to list everything wrong with it I can think of, there is no need to waste your time or mine misrepresenting the car.

Asking $3250 or best offer.

I may accept part or full trade for vehicles.

Some items I am interested in are:

Decent Mig or tig welder
Motorcycles (no dirtbikes unless street legal)- I can add cash if it is something nice I like
hunting and personal protection equipment. 
Gold and silver coins or jewelry (I may ask to verify purity at jeweler)
A nice street bicycle
Good generator

or possibly a high capacity rifle like an AK, Yugo SKS with extras, a cheap AR, Kel-tec SU-16, etc. May also consider a nice long distance rifle with scope like a 30-06 or .308, let me know what you have, can't hurt to ask. And like I said I can accept or include pre 1964 silver coins, and/or ammo for the right deal, so I'm not expecting an AR straight up (unless it's a sporter or a DPMS cheapy), I'm a realist. But let's remember, there are currently brand new $500 AR's, and last year I bought an SKS for $200, and an AK for $350, I know they have gone up due to demand, but please do not tell me your SKS is worth $400 and your Wasr AK is worth $700 because they aren't to me lol. SKS = 250-350 depending on model and features, AK = 500-600 depending in my book."

I am looking to sell or trade my RIA 1911 Compact .45. Great gun and I think RIA is the little secret in the 1911 world as far as what you are getting for what you pay. Nothing wrong with the gun, great shooter just a little heavy for my liking on a conceled carry gun. 

So the handgun comes with a Safariland paddle holster and two Kimber magazines, one has the little attachment at the bottome the other is slick. Gun is in great condtion, a little holster rub but nothing major on the finish. Pics show some oil from cleaning and care lol.

 Looking for cash to put towards the purchase of a new .45 poly like a Glock 30 or Springfield XDs...so I'm also open to trades in that area as well but open to other guns chambered in .45 as I've stocked up on some ammo and want to keep it all.
