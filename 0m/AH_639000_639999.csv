Preferably less than 10,000,000 rounds through it. I'm not too picky as long as it's functional.
I've never read anything good about a WASR or M10, so I'd like to avoid those if possible.  Milled preferred, but stamped perfectly fine.  Mak 90/91 would certainly be OK.

No CPL, but we can do transfer @ FFL if you request.

$750 is my max price unless you have something like an SGL21 or similar.  Or if it comes with ammo/extras, I can bump my max up some.  

Thanks for looking!"

One of the most accurate .50BMG rifles available.  It will shoot sub MOA in the right hands, which are not mine.  I got it in trade with a Bushnell 10X scope mounted (the one that comes on Barrett .50 ""kits"") which seems to hold up to the reverse recoil of the .50 just fine.  That said, a rifle of this caliber needs quality glass and I just don't feel like spending the money for a Nightforce or a Swarovski on a rifle that I barely shoot (I prefer to pack light).  If I shot match, it might be a different story, but since I don't, I'd rather have the cash and focus on my other precision rifles.  Note:  This is not the National Match edition, which has a tighter chamber and can have issues with military ammo (I hear).  Anyway, here is what you get:

- Rifle ($3,359)
- 15MOA scope base ($80)
- Bushnell 10X mildot ($200)
- Prince Bipod ($213)
- OD Green Pelican Case for the kit ($300)
- 10 rounds of Hornady A-MAX ($50)
Over $4,200 has been spent on this rifle.

I am open to trades: Savage 110B, Robinson XCR, PWS Diablo upper, SCAR, .300 Blackout SBR/Pistol upper, Aimpoint Micro, Aimpoint/Eotech 3X Multiplier, etc.  
As you can see, I'm only interested in quality products.  If you have something else you think I might like, let me know.  I am also looking to get a quality 60-80 gallon air compressor as well, so if you have one we can work it into the deal.

Obviously, I can pull the scope, as this is a ""starter scope"" for a rifle of this caliber.

I must say, this thing is insanely fun to shoot.  I have shot many .50BMG rifles, and the Armalite is by far the most enjoyable.

The RFB is not for sale, just for scale.

The solid top brass receiver features side ejection. The overall length is 38½"" and this powerhouse weighs in at 8.68 lbs.

A nice 19th century touch is the use of a fully adjustable Marble semi-buckhorn rear sight with white diamond insert and brass beaded front sight. The .45 Colt is the cartridge that was said to have ""killed more game, big and small, and more men, good and bad, than any other in existence."" Our tubular magazine can pack ten of these powerful bruisers. The .45 Colt is a serious hunting tool, and has proven itself time and time again on all of the world's game. We trust the Henry Big Boy .45 will soon become a favorite of big game hunters due to its handsome looks, rugged reliability and proven knockdown power.

The Henry Big Boy .45 Colt is also offered for you cowpokes who do Cowboy Action Shooting. The Big Boys have the smoothest actions of any centerfire lever action rifles on the market today. They work beautifully to give you competition shooters a leg up in any event you take part in.

Built 6 years ago by Youngs Gunsmithing in Sand Coulee, MT. It was built from all new parts. It has a 1 in 10 twist that works great with bigger bullets, but still shots smaller bullets real well. It has about 100 rounds through it. I have dyes and some brass for it that I will throw in with the deal. At 100 yds I have worked up a load that will shoot .27 inchs with Sierra Match Kings 300 grain. The farthest I have shot a big game animal (antelope)  was 756 yds with a 180 grain nosler, ranged with a Swarovski range finder, so just to let you know it was not a guess. I have done some 1000 yds and 1 mile shooting with this rifle and it did real well at those distinces too. The biggest animal I have shot was an elk at about 400 yds and it had no problem bringing it down. The gun has a    4-14 30 mm MP-8 reticle IOR tactical scope with warren bases and rings on it, which cost about $1400 new and the gun was $2400 without the muzzle break which was $220. The gun, scope, ring, bases and muzzle break costed me $4020 total. The gun has a Accumark stock with fiberglass bedding, Weatherby mark 5 action, a slightly heavier then factory stainless steel Krieger barrel. The action and barrel is painted in Hi quality gun paint (black) and the stock is factory look.

Now back to the bike:
 It has decent looking fairings but has a a few cracks here and there, the front bright headlight is broken. the other works fine and no issues with drivability. It is fast and my wife says I gotta get rid of it... something about pulling the front end up (accidently) on douglass for a bit. I am getting to old for this type of bike, so I guess I will stick to the cruisers. the tank has some dings and scratches in it from what looks like falling off of something or falling into something.

I purchased it last December with the intention of SBRing it, but never got around to sitting down with a lawyer and creating a NFA trust. Now I've decided to let it go in order to fund other projects.

It has an actual MP5 rear sight drum, not the G3 style found on some clones. It also has a paddle magazine release, three lug barrel and a fluted chamber. Trigger housing a metal HK 93/94 type. It has 300 rounds through it (one full load from each magazine I own) to test for function.

This is ready to SBR once you get the proper paperwork and engravings. A new stock will bolt right on, and the gun is already 922r compliant so there is no need for parts swapping.

Price has been dropped to 500 bucks FIRM and I will not go any lower than that (been offered real close to that by a local gun store). Emails at the moment are the best way to get a hold of me. A possible trade at the moment would be a Glock 17 3rd gen in close to same shape with at least 2 mags plus some cash (75 bucks minimum)



I have a Beretta 92fs blued version w/ 2 factory 15 round mags, 1 gov. contract 15 round mag, and the original Beretta factory blue case. The overall condition of the gun is excellent/like new (95-98%) and looks just plain beautiful, this is NOT a police trade in or some roughed up surplus gun, this gun is damn near mint. The price is set at 500 Firm.

Just some quick points when dealing with me

Im not going to be your personal gander mt or bass pro where you can call me up, arrange a meeting, and then just ""take a look at it"", you are either going to agree to a price prior to meeting or dont waste my time or a few bucks worth of my gas money. Also, do not show up agreeing on a price and pull the classic bs move of ""i only have x amount of money, is that ok?"" I WILL NOT EVEN REGARD YOUR OFFER AT THAT POINT AND I WILL DRIVE OFF. 
I would like to stay in the ozark/nixa/springfield area and no im not going to go on a four hour drive to meet up at a place you might not even show up at or call me at the last minute telling me you cant make it. You must be willing to sign a bill of sale and provide i.d. at time of sale showing you are legal to my knowledge to own a handgun. 

Its stupid that I even have to put all that crap up there but apparently in this day and age of the wal mart consumer, this crap happens to not only me but many that use this site so please, I do not wish to waste your time and I sure as hell dont want you wasting mine.
This is a pristine example of a firearm that is the sidearm of our military, if you want a ""cheap"" pistol go buy a hi point.

Has a barrel length of 16.50"" and weighs 7lbs. Also has a adjustable rear sight and has a 10 round capacity. I bought this rifle NIB six weeks ago for $850 including shipping. I have since equipped the rifle with a Leatherwood HiLux 2-7x32 LER scout scope and purchased four Ruger polymer 10 round magazines in addition to the 10 round Accuracy International steel magazine that came with the rifle and a nice soft side Ace 40"" case that fits like a glove. I've shot a total of 40 rounds of 168 gr match through the rifle and she is a very accurate weapon with a really nice trigger. I've got just over $1100 invested in the rifle but unfortunately have to sell some toys since my daughter needs braces. My loss is your gain!  Please, no low ball offers...price is $750 OBO. Whoever purchases the rifle will basically be getting a NIB condition gun and a complete accessory kit for less than what a NIB Gunsite costs at any of the online retailers like Bud's.

The Armory USA SSR85C-2 is unique among the AK family as it combines characteristics of both the AK-47 and the AKM rifle. AK characteristics : Wide front sight base Gas block 8 port/side venting gas tube Lower handguard retainer 800 meter rear sight Rear sight base Non-ribbed receiver cover Bolt Telescoping recoil spring guide rod AKM characteristics : Slant brake Reinforced safety lever Flat firing pin Stamped receiver Polymer stock and pistol grip Made in Bulgaria, the SSR85C-2 receiver is a modified AKM type, 1.6mm thick compared to 1mm receiver on a “standard” AKM. Made to Armory USA specifications, the SSR85C-2’s thicker receiver allows for greater durability and accuracy, and were designed for the use of double hook triggers. This allows the rifles a smoother trigger pull without the “trigger slap“ found on many AK‘s that use single-hook trigger systems. US made components - Slant brake Milled steel double hook 3 piece trigger group (hammer, trigger and disconnector) Stainless steel gas piston Polymer pistol grip"

This firearm is a real beauty, slide action racks as smooth as butter. The rail has never been mounted. No nicks or dings, the slide had just been refinished with a Colt Grey duracoat. Has a low round count of 150, it has never malfunctioned on me. If you know these HKs, these things are tough and can take a serious beating. This has been my preferred target shooter as I was able to double tap 80yrds away at a 20x20 target.

However, money is getting scarce and I have issues with my insurance company. This regretfully has to go soon.

Available in either a Natural Stainless (shown) or Nitron® finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom wood grips. The grips are rosewood on this Nitron® version. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols features a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance. This handgun has been very lightly used and is in absolute mint condition.It also comes with 3 additional magazines."

I have a Saiga AK 47, converted from a sporterized import. Firearm is completely black, Tapco G2 trigger grouping with billet trigger guard, Tapco 6 position stock, Tapco forend with rail, and a soft case. I am including 2 polymer magazines (20 and 10 round).

It is a converted (need to point this fact out due to people confusing the sporter Saiga 7.62x39 with this converted Saiga AK 47) Saiga AK 47. I am into this rifle for much more than the asking price, the sporter stock rifle cost $450(new) and about $150 into the trigger group and another $150 for the furniture alone, not to mention the mags, case and labor costs. This is a REAL Russian AK 47, not some WASR Romanian or Chinese knock off. Made in the Izhmash factory which pumped out the original Kalashnikov AKs all these years.
