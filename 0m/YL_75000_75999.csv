The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

The metal is excellent and the wood is very nice. This AK has grenade launching capability and grenade launching sight as shown in the pictures.

The rifle shoots the popular 7.62x39 caliber. It is very accurate, features a threaded muzzle with a slant brake installed Two mil-surp metal 30 round mag's and Green canvas sling,compensator, bayonet lug,bayonet and scabbard (number matching) and heavy duty bipod with 200 rounds,upgraded Black fore end with UltiMAK M9 optic mount ( Wood Fore end Included ).Barrel: 16 1/4"", Overall: 34 1/4"".. Shot very little less then 100 rounds.

The rifle is a combination of original Yugoslavian rifle parts and U.S.-made compliance parts. The fit and finish of the rifle is more than acceptable, with an evenly applied Parkerized finish and an above-average-condition wood fore-end.

The M70B1 has some novel features that set it apart from the run-of-the-mill AK variant. First, it has the enlarged and reinforced area around the trunnion like the RPK on its stamped receiver. In addition, a unique grenade ladder sight located on the gas block, when rotated into its upward open position, provides meter range marks and cuts off the gas port in the gas block. Also, the rifle features front and rear flip-up night sights, although the luminous material has long since disappeared. Has a smooth and comfortable trigger."

No. 6 Rolling Block Rifle
A lightweight, small rifle designed expressly to be used by
young boys. It is chambered for the .22 rimfire cartridge, as well
as the .32 Short or Long. It was also produced with a smoothbore
barrel to be used with shot cartridges. The round barrel is
20"" in length. It has a takedown action with a barrel held on by
a knurled knob underneath the frame. It is a lightweight rolling
block, with a thin operating knob on the breech. The finish is
blued overall. Early models featured a case-colored frame, and
these versions would be worth approximately 10 percent additional.
It has a straight-grip walnut stock with a small forearm.
Over 250,000 manufactured between 1902 and 1903."

Nice colt, shoots great, these come pretty loaded from the factory.

Has the colt blue finish, some scratches and the infamous idiot mark.  Includes one wilson combat magazine.  No box/papers.  Not original owner so do not know the round count.  Shoots really nice, got it in a trade, but rather have the cash right now.

Not looking for any trades unless you REALLY want to trade down (IE you're going to offer me your $1000+ 1911, why you would do that, I don't know).  Or maybe a XDM compact (they new one, not your $400 sub compact) plus cash.  Pretty much not looking to trade.   Well, if you REALLY want to offer me up your stainless colt defender I'll consider it.

I don't need to sell it.  It takes you longer to type up your lowball $500 offer than it takes me to delete it.

Just got out of the Army three days ago and I want a shotgun to carry around with me when I go hiking or camping, as I plan to do a lot of it once Spring comes.
The pawn shops in my area are just far too overpriced and the people who work in them are far too rude for me to even consider buying from them.

Wanting to keep the prices within the $250-$450 range.

I would prefer a Winchester 1300 or Browning Auto 5 if you have one, but I will consider any 12 gauge you have as long as it's within my offering price, I'm far from picky right now.

Please have pictures of your shotgun and the most basic price you're looking to get, and please don't contact me if you're not absolutely serious about selling.

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

The metal is excellent and the wood is very nice. This AK has grenade launching capability and grenade launching sight as shown in the pictures.

The rifle shoots the popular 7.62x39 caliber. It is very accurate, features a threaded muzzle with a slant brake installed Two mil-surp metal 30 round mag's and Green canvas sling,compensator, bayonet lug,bayonet and scabbard (number matching) and heavy duty bipod with 200 rounds,upgraded Black fore end with UltiMAK M9 optic mount ( Wood Fore end Included ).Barrel: 16 1/4"", Overall: 34 1/4"".. Shot very little less then 100 rounds.

The rifle is a combination of original Yugoslavian rifle parts and U.S.-made compliance parts. The fit and finish of the rifle is more than acceptable, with an evenly applied Parkerized finish and an above-average-condition wood fore-end.

The M70B1 has some novel features that set it apart from the run-of-the-mill AK variant. First, it has the enlarged and reinforced area around the trunnion like the RPK on its stamped receiver. In addition, a unique grenade ladder sight located on the gas block, when rotated into its upward open position, provides meter range marks and cuts off the gas port in the gas block. Also, the rifle features front and rear flip-up night sights, although the luminous material has long since disappeared. Has a smooth and comfortable trigger.

The metal is excellent and the wood is very nice. This AK has grenade launching capability and grenade launching sight as shown in the pictures.

The rifle shoots the popular 7.62x39 caliber. It is very accurate, features a threaded muzzle with a slant brake installed Two mil-surp metal 30 round mag's and Green canvas sling,compensator, bayonet lug,bayonet and scabbard (number matching) and heavy duty bipod with 200 rounds,upgraded Black fore end with UltiMAK M9 optic mount ( Wood Fore end Included ).Barrel: 16 1/4"", Overall: 34 1/4"".. Shot very little less then 100 rounds.

The rifle is a combination of original Yugoslavian rifle parts and U.S.-made compliance parts. The fit and finish of the rifle is more than acceptable, with an evenly applied Parkerized finish and an above-average-condition wood fore-end.

The M70B1 has some novel features that set it apart from the run-of-the-mill AK variant. First, it has the enlarged and reinforced area around the trunnion like the RPK on its stamped receiver. In addition, a unique grenade ladder sight located on the gas block, when rotated into its upward open position, provides meter range marks and cuts off the gas port in the gas block. Also, the rifle features front and rear flip-up night sights, although the luminous material has long since disappeared. Has a smooth and comfortable trigger.

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

BOY’S RIFLES
The Stevens Company produced an extensive line of smaller,
single-shot rifles chambered for small calibers and intended
primarily for use by young shooters. These firearms have become
quite collectible and are considered a field of specialty by
many modern collectors.
NOTE: There are many variations that were available with a
number of options that would affect their value. We supply information
and values for the major variations but would recommend
securing a qualified appraisal if in doubt.
“FAVORITE” RIFLES
This series of rifles is chambered for the .22, .25, and .32 rimfire.
It has a 22"" part-octagonal barrel and is blued, with a case-colored
frame. It has a takedown-type action with an interchangeable
barrel feature. It was available with optional sights, as well
as buttplates. There were approximately 1,000,000 manufactured
between 1893 and 1939.

Rough Rider locks up securely and has perfect timing to provide you
with optimum accuracy. No short cuts are taken. The Rough Rider barrel
is machined, micro-threaded, then it is inserted into the frame at a
controlled depth. This regulates the barrel to cylinder gap and
provides you with maximum power. Frame mounted hammer block with red
indicator for extra protection. Satin finish. Exotic species hardwood
grips.

I bought this gun brand new 3 months ago.  I have carried de-cockers my entire career, and always wanted a 1911.  But I just can not (phycologicaly) get used to the carry style (hammer cocked) of the 1911.  I apparently am in the minority.

I have shot 120 rounds though the gun since purchasing new. 

There are no cosmetic blemish's or operational defects. 

Rock Island does not advertise a life time warranty but they guarantee there products for life.  One of the main reasons I bought this brand. 

This is Rock Islands sales pitch on the gun. 
Rock Island 1911 is a full size all stainless .45 acp 5 inch barrel, Novak style low mount dovetail front and rear sights, ambi safety, lightweight trigger, commander hammer, beaver-tail grip safety and full length guide rod. It has a matte nickel finish

I am interested in an Lever action in .357/.38 or .44 or .45L...large pistol calibers or .410 only...no 30-30's or 30-06's etc.......though I prefer one in the .357.... and preferably an Marlin 1894c.... or a lever action pistol like the mare's leg or puma..... I know any AR-15 in .223/5.56 would be unexpectedly awesome! or just shoot me an offer if ya have something Interesting.....I actually love that SxS 12 gauge so I will only trade and will not accept any cash

I absolutely will not answer any number I don't know so TEXT ONLY!!!
