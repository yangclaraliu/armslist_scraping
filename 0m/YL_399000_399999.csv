I am seeling my Huglu U4E Over/Under Shotgun.  This gun was crafted and designed by Mark Dehaan of Dehaan Shotguns.  If you would like to know how well these guns are made and the craftmanship that goes into them then please go to www.dhshotguns.com and read all about the process its VERY WELL MADE!
This model is the U4E Sport model which sells new for around $1500.00 then there are all of the extras that this gun has! Mark Dehaan and I have spoken over numerous emails and he has told me that this was one of his nicest guns and most expensive, but now with the economy and things I have to part with one of my favorite guns of all time, YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE HOW NICE THIS GUN IS.  
A man once told me that a Huglu from Dehaan was the nicest gun that you have never heard about and he was so right!
I will list all of the specs of the gun below, and please look at all the photos as they are of the exact gun you will purchase.

Barrel length is 30""
Barrel are matte finish (so nice)
Ported barrels ($250)
Screw in choke system with 2 Chokes 
Auto Ejectors ($299)
Palm Swell (fits hands very nice)
Adjustable Comb ($295)
Adjustable safety switch at the thumb
Butt plate pad
And the hand engraved side plates which are so NICE!

This over under is built extremely well and if you can find anyone who has actually had one they are often compared to Berretta style.  You will not find a better over under for the price and craftmanship that goes into these!
I would love to answer any questions you have, and I will entertain all serious offers.
I would prefer to meet up in person and do the sell that way but if the buyer needs it shipped to an FFL I will be happy to do this but at the buyers expense.  All shipping and final pricing can be negotiated to make the deal.

This is a great gun for teaching young ones to shoot, it's fun and fast to reload, great plinker, and ammo is cheap. And if you install the T-grip and trigger shoe, it's perfect for a youngster's hands, but it will still fit you if you've got big paws.

The Sig Sauer P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other
combat handguns are measured. Designed as Sig entrant in the militarytrials
to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy Seals,
Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas
Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a
few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full size pistol easy
to handle. Available in either 9MM, .357 Sig or .40 S&W, its longer barrel
yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

So he took it to a smith and had it professionally hacked off! Ouch but other than that, it as God intended for a great WW2 rifle. The gent I purchased from said he took his first deer with it, so it comes with a good track record...

I am selling one of my 300 blackout uppers. It has a 16.5"" barrel which I have turned/profiled/chambered to tight/match specs. 1/10 twist. The outside of the barrel has been turned concentric to the bore. 

It has a low round count (under 350 rounds.) The muzzle end is not threaded, but I can single point thread it for 5/8x24 for 50.00 extra, if you want to attach a flash suppressor or silencer.

Included will be approx 500+ newly formed/trimmed brass to get you started. (About 100.00 extra value!)

With an acog scope, this is MOA capable if you do your part. (I always blame myself, rather than the gun.)
My favorite load is bulk 150gr FMJ millitary pulldowns, trimmed LC brass, 16.5gr H110 powder and federal SR primers.

I also can form 300 blk brass if you bring me CLEAN unsized .223 or 5.56 brass. Call me for availability as I do this when I'm not at work.

I've built several of these rifles, and can't really justify keeping all of them. Selling this will help me build new ones.

i shot about one and half boxes of ammo through it. needs to be sighted in.
very slight scratching on the foregrip, scratches have been stained so at least theyre not noticeable. gives the gun character anyway.

comes with 10 or 11 rounds of ammo to get you started and sighted in.

has been shot so little, that the loading door isnt even scratched up from loading in rounds.

appears to be drilled and tapped from the factory, so you can put a scope on it.

this is the CS model, meaning i think its a Carbine, and it has a Safety

most people like the winchester as a lever action, but i can tell you the marlin is a superior shooter. the hooded front sight makes sighting easier. it ejects to the side instead of the top, so you can put a scope on it. the lever action workings are much simpler and more durable and feel solid compared to the winchester. the stock feels alot nicer on your shoulder and in your hands.

this really is a wonderful rifle, and i would just keep it and never shoot it, but she should be used be someone who will appreciate her.

included is a cable gun lock, with which some inventiveness, i was able to secure around the rifle to keep kids or room mates from actuating the lever and discharging the rifle.

open to trades for other firearms only. price is firm. cash only. if the ad is up, i still have the rifle. will only sell to Vermont resident."

First off this car is no jewl.  It has a lot of hail damage, Dents, Interior is not great, Turn signal switch needs replaced (Turn signals work but break lights do not unless you hold a little pressure on the turn signal switch).   205,xxx miles i think.  This was my work car and got great gas mileage. The reason i parked it, It needs a new cat converter or the current one hollowed out i believe.  The car ran when i parked it about 7 months ago but the battery is shot so it has been taken out.  The car ran great before the cat plugged up.  I had a new transmission put in about 50,000 miles ago from Chances Transmission in Wichita.  Just the price of the tranny was $1600 not including labor to install it.  This would make a great work car, lil fishing wagon or just use it for parts.  Just needs a little work to get on the road.  Took the car to Oklahoma several times and was always dependable.  Has the normal lifter noise, Tires are not great and struts are wore out.  The car will need to be trailered or dollyed unless you bring your own battery and want to chance the converter plugging up and stalling and the old gas. NOW once again, Bring a trailer, Dolly, Or if you want to chance it bring your battery (i do not suggest this option but if you do dont call me 10 miles down the road and tell me the car died and want me to assist you!).  The car is not pretty, Not clean, and i do not guarantee anything.  If you are a serious buyer and not someone that is just wasting my time i will get a battery to hook up and prove it runs.  The battery will not come with the car!!!!  If you have no means of hauling it then please dont call and waste my time.  I work 70+hrs a week and weekends are busy.

Look, it is just like the one you wanted to build, but didn't know which parts to buy, couldn't afford the tools, or were worried about the specifications.  All that is taken care of for you - just add your lower with a stock and start shooting.  C'mon - you know you want it!

This is a high quality upper.  Please no low ball offers."

The FLIR RECON M24 Monocular is a rugged, lightweight thermal pocket scope.  Designed as a multi-use pocket scope, the M24 fits in the palm of your hand.  It’s fully Mil-Spec, hardened housing means the thermal core is highly protected against field abuse.  The M24 is a small, no-frills thermal scope.  It was developed to provide individual thermal capability to Warfighters and Law Enforcement Professionals.  Size and weight are of the utmost importance, so extra features like image capture and recording were left out.  The M24 is a thermal imager through and through.

The Recon M24 has easy-to-use controls that allow new operators to quickly master its capabilities.  The objective lens is factory set to a fixed focal plane, leaving only the diopter lens open to adjustment.  Power is controlled with a lockable rotating dial that exposes the brightness control wheel when open.  In fact, the clever layout of the controls adds a lot to the easy user interface.

The RECON M24 is one of the handiest little thermal imagers available.  For the price and size, there is no comparison with other models on the market, especially because the M24 features a hardened Mil-Spec thermal core.  All internal components are made right here in the US.  One of our favorite aspects of the M24 is the control layout.  The innovative control scheme is highly intuitive, keeping the functions locked when the unit is turned off.  The fixed focal plane keeps focusing the unit quick and easy.  Another really nice feature is the hot-swappable batteries.  You can change the batteries one at a time without killing power.

As mentioned already, the M24 is designed as a small pocket scope.  The 19mm lens is small and does not offer a lot of range, but can easily detect people out to 300 yards.  The M24 is a great option for rugged environments.

Export of Thermal Imaging Equipment or related accessories (such as manuals) is strictly regulated by the US Department of State in accordance with the guidelines of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  It is a major crime to ship or carry US manufactured thermal imaging devices outside the borders of the United States, punishable by fines and prison sentences.  Ignorance of these regulations will not hold up in court.  By purchasing thermal imaging equipment from TNVC, you attest that you will not attempt to export or carry this thermal imaging equipment outside the borders of the United States.  Also, it illegal to allow a non-US Citizen to look through US Thermal Imaging Equipment, even on US soil.  Again, this is a crime punishable by fines and prison sentences."

Selling a decked out, crazy accurate (see picture with nickel for scale), not a scratch, ready to rock-n-roll rock river arms AR-15 with all the extras! Like new with only 200 rounds thru the rifle! Scope is zero'd in @ 100yards and is very accurate (see picture with nickel for scale!). 4shot targets @ 100yards was shot with bulk box brass cased american eagle 55grn brand ammo and I'm sure you could really zero this rifle in more with better ammo. Not too darn bad with bulk box type ammo. 4shot groupings are about the size of a nickel / quarter @ 100yards in the pictures. Absolutely nothing wrong with the rifle. This is one awesome rifle! Comes with all the ""extras"" original packaging.

This is a 1790 Brittish Aquatint that has three artist's combined works in one. The original piece was painted by George Morland English Painter (1763-1804) with permission it was Etched by Thomas Rowlandson English Painter and Caricaturist (1756-1827) and Aquatinted by Samuel Alken Sr. a Brittish Sporting Artist (1756-1815). 

This was issued as a Sporting Series in 1790 and published by J. Harris and T. Merle. This was acertained by Ralph Richardson's Chronological Catalogue of Etchings and Engravings showing their years of publication (all were published in London). Reference: http://www.sterlingtimes.org/morland_catalogue2.htm
The above link could also help reflect its value as well.

The artwork is in excellent condition for its age, the colors are period and the paper type period to its age. The piece is framed and matted and ready for display. On the right side there is a slight water stain, this could be extracted or touched up with a professional restoration I am told, however it is not in the main body of the artwork. At the bottom left is G. Morland and T. Rowlandson's credentials and on the lower right is S. Alken's credentials with the date of 1790.

This is a period piece that does not come up for sale often, it is an original and not any type of reproduction. I have no knowledge of art and only inherited this piece and only passing on the research that I have obtained. Please research online or at a local art museum for details. I am told in an auction setting this piece should sell between 1700 - 2500 USD, but I have no intrest in trying to get that as I dont even know of art gallerys around here in Kansas? 
I would like to trade this piece for a shotgun, rifle, or pistol as I am not a big art fan, I am sure there are some art enthusiest out there that would love to have it, very cool hunting scene and would display nicely. I just dont know art or what the hell to do with this piece??? So I will trade it...

854,http://www.armslist.com/posts/399854,For Trade:  1790 Pheasant Art Piece,"Wichita, Wichita, Kansas",Offer,"Listed On: Sunday, May 13, 2012",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"You are looking at a rare piece of history here (Pheasant Shooting). This is a 1790 Brittish Aquatint that has three artist's combined works in one. The original piece was painted by George Morland English Painter (1763-1804) with permission it was Etched by Thomas Rowlandson English Painter and Caricaturist (1756-1827) and Aquatinted by Samuel Alken Sr. a Brittish Sporting Artist (1756-1815). 

This was issued as a Sporting Series in 1790 and published by J. Harris and T. Merle. This was acertained by Ralph Richardson's Chronological Catalogue of Etchings and Engravings showing their years of publication (all were published in London). Reference: http://www.sterlingtimes.org/morland_catalogue2.htm
The above link could also help reflect its value as well.

The artwork is in excellent condition for its age, the colors are period and the paper type period to its age. The piece is framed and matted and ready for display. On the right side there is a slight water stain, this could be extracted or touched up with a professional restoration I am told, however it is not in the main body of the artwork. At the bottom left is G. Morland and T. Rowlandson's credentials and on the lower right is S. Alken's credentials with the date of 1790.

This is a period piece that does not come up for sale often, it is an original and not any type of reproduction. I have no knowledge of art and only inherited this piece and only passing on the research that I have obtained. Please research online or at a local art museum for details. I am told in an auction setting this piece should sell between 1700 - 2500 USD, but I have no intrest in trying to get that as I dont even know of art gallerys around here in Kansas? 
I would like to trade this piece for a shotgun, rifle, or pistol as I am not a big art fan, I am sure there are some art enthusiest out there that would love to have it, very cool hunting scene and would display nicely. I just dont know art or what the hell to do with this piece??? So I will trade it...

Please see photos for quality, condition, size, colors, etc... Thanks so much for your time! For additional photos please email me."
