The UTS-15 tactical shotgun is a 12 ga. pump action shotgun with two 7-round alternately feeding or selectable magazine tubes, that measuring 28.3” in overall length with a 18.5” barrel chambers for 2 3/4” and 3” magnum ammunition. Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer the UTS-15 weighs only 6.9 lbs, for quick pointing and easy handling. The top mounted picatinny rail allows for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, which coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to any situation (sights and choke tube pictured not included).

Press Release Oct 7, 2013 – Des Plaines, IL
UTS-15 DELIVERY TIME CUT TO FIVE DAYS IN THE U.S.

UTAS-USA, American manufacturer of the revolutionary UTS-15 tactical shotgun announced today that production has again doubled to drastically cutting the time it takes to fill dealer’s orders.
UTAS-USA Director of Operations, Matt Guzeldere stated today, “We’ve been working hard to cut down the time it takes to fill new dealer’s orders. Right now any new orders are filled within about five business days. Order volume for the UTS-15 is still very heavy, but we’ve expanded operations, added more people and we’re now working weekends to keep lead times to a minimum and help our dealers make money. We have also released the Hunting Model UTS-15 and the Marine Model as well, but lead times on these new models are running slightly longer.”

GALCO M5X MATRIX 

The M5X paddle holster is a versatile addition to Galco’s line of Matrix™ thermoplastic holsters. 

The durable, injection-molded Matrix line is lightweight, comfortable, and nearly maintenance free – while remaining fast in action, concealable, and easy on the budget! 

Like all Galco paddle holsters, the M5X locks solidly on the belt while still remaining easy to attach and remove. 

The M5X securely positions the handgun at the beltline with a moderate butt-forward angle, enhancing concealability yet maintaining ease and speed of draw. Twin tension units allow the user to micro-adjust the feel of the draw while retaining a proper level of firearm retention. Unlike many other harsh, mechanical-looking plastic holsters, the Matrix resembles a hand-molded Galco leather holster. The M5X paddle fits belts up to 1 3/4"". 


Made for semiautomatic pistols and double-action revolvers.

USED WITH GLOCK 19, 23 & 32

The rifle exudes history from stock to finish.

It is a very nice example of the ""Lotta"" rifle, the only real detractor from this rifle is that it has a mismatched serialized bolt, which is fairly common place among Mosins.

This one is not counterbored and has it's original stock finish and bluing, plenty of rifling left and a nice tight muzzle with what looks to be the original crown. 

There are a few (dime size?) A and W stamps (a couple of which actually look raised) on this stock, it also has a wooden dow type (pencil sized) plug on the bottom where an Austrian type swivel would/might have been screwed in at one time.

Either way the Russian M91 butt part of the stock was later reused and fingerspliced by the ""Finn's"" into what it is now.

Please feel free to ask questions and I'll answer what I can, other great information can be found on Vic Thomas's site with this link.

http://mosinnagant.net/finland/M24-Rifle.asp

I would  like $400.00 for this one in a face to face sale in the Richmond, Henrico, Mechanicsville area.


Sling and loops are not part of this sale.

As stated in my other listings I have not fired this one and I am only selling this and other pieces to purchase another equally nice rifle that is not already in my collection.

Sorry, I didn't notice until after dark that only a few of my pictures were presentable, so this is what I have.

Don't miss out on this nice piece, with no shipping charges or auction hassles and anxiety.

Great rifle.  used once.  Shot maybe 100 rounds through it.
It is a solid, tack driving machine.  

I thought it would be sufficient for my needs, but once I loaded my pack up, its just too heavy to hit the bush.  Barska red dot included.  $560 retail.
Asking 100$ less than what I paid for basically a brand new rifle.

I got the rifle about a year ago in a box almost completely disassembled.  I thought it would be fun to build an AK-47, but after assembling it kinda lost interest.  Here is what I know about it.  I was told it is a Polish kit.  The receiver has Vulcan stamped on it.  The bolt, bolt carrier, and front trunion have matching serial numbers.  The grip says made in USA.  The trigger is a Tapco G2.  

I have never fired this gun and cannot say for certain that it is assembled correctly.  Please be knowledgeable about AK-47's.  I assembled this rifle from watching Youtube videos.  Gun does appear to have been fired at some time.  It appears that the ejector has been welded on.  Please refer to photo.

The front furniture are two different colors of wood. 

The underfolder stock works correctly

The front trunion is not riveted on, but was drilled and tapped before I got the gun.

I do not have any ammunition or magazines for the gun.

The gun will come with 2- magazine pouches with oil bottles, 1- roll up cleaning kit, and 1- sling.  Also included will be all the extra parts that came with the kit.  Appears to be 2- slant cut flash hiders, 2- unmarked trigger sets, 1- dust cover, 2- unmarked pistol grips, and misc bolts/springs/clips.  I have several additional photographs of the gun, and can take any photographs you wish.  If you have any questions please ask.  Thank You."

This gun has never been fired, finish is excellent, comes with all original paperwork.  Was purchased in early 90`s and kept in my safe.  It is just a little over 14 inches in length, and comes with original 30 round clip

 The Spectre is an Italian submachine gun that was produced by the SITES factory in Turin. It was designed by Roberto Teppa and Claudio Gritti in the mid-1980s. Production in Italy ceased in the year 1997, with the closure of SITES, but proceeded in very small numbers in Switzerland through Greco Sport S.A., a company founded by one of the designers of the Spectre, Claudio Gritti, until 2001. During the mid 80’s and early 90’s, a limited number made its way to the states via imported by American Arms Inc. The Spectre is used by the Swiss armed forces and by Italian armed forces, and has been exported elsewhere.

The Spectre is a compact and light weapon, designed for instant firepower in close combat at short ranges. The four models have top-folding buttstocks, and were available with or without a forward handgrip ahead of the magazine housing. The largely polymer Spectre has a stamped-steel receiver.

The Spectre is a standard blowback firearm operating from a closed bolt; however it has some unusual features. The barrel shroud completely hides the barrel. The bolt is designed to pump air through the barrel shroud to provide additional cooling. The Spectre is hammer-fired and the trigger group is double action with a decocker. This allows the shooter to safely carry a round in the chamber and fire immediately. As this eliminates the need for cocking prior to shooting no manual safety is provided. Unconventional 30-round capacity, four-column magazine is provided with the Spectre, but it can also use conventional magazines."

It has the stainless cylinder, stainless satin finish, low profile fixed sights, combat grips, exposed hammer, and a smooth trigger pull.  It is chambered for the powerful yet light recoiling .22 WMR round.  Loaded with FMJ this round can penetrate 5"" of pine or over 24"" of ballistic gelatin.  Loaded with ballistic tipped hunting ammo the bullet will explode 5"" after impact.  Stopping power of the .22 Magnum is comparable to .380 ACP, but unlike an automatic pistol a revolver will never jam.  This is the PERFECT CCW for novice shooters who are sensitive to recoil or individuals with arthritis or wrist injuries.  Powerful, reliable, lightweight, and zero recoil.

This pistol is like new in box with papers and everything that came with it.  Only approximately 100 rounds down the pipe.  A few very minor handling / holster marks which are barely noticeable unless you're really looking hard under a strong light.  This gun is really LNIB, but I'll call it ""excellent"" condition. 

ANY factory or aftermarket Charter Arms grip will fit the Pathfinder (Undercover, Off Duty, Bulldog, etc) if you'd like some wood grips.  Custom grips are frequently available on eBay (there's a set of pearl grips up there right now).  This revolver will fit in ANY J-frame holster.  I recommend the Uncle Mike's Size 3 pocket holster.

Pistol runs fine.  I decided I would prefer another .38 instead.  Selling at a steep discount to fund another purchase.  Not interested in any trades unless you have a Charter Arms DAO or a Taurus 85CH.  Might consider another LCR.  I will accept good quality factory .44 Special ammo as a partial trade (no reloads).

I will include a box of ballistic tipped hunting ammo with this revolver.

Prefer to meet within a reasonable distance of greater Denver area.  CASH ONLY.  WILL NOT SHIP.  No bad guys.

Thanks."

Laser System Smaller and Smarter

NEW IN PACKAGE

Subcompact V3 laser by LaserLyte® is the company's most state-of-the-art, smallest and versatile rail mounted laser to date. Now half the size of the previous model, the Subcompact V3 needs less than ¾-inch of Picatinny rail space to easily mount onto even the smallest firearms.

Constructed of T6 aluminum for extra strength and durability, this updated unit offers a smart, cost-effective auto-off feature. If left on for five minutes, the unit begins to display a unique flash for one minute, indicating to the user that the unit will automatically shut off soon. After one minute in flash mode the unit shuts itself off to extend battery life, prevent accidental activation and battery depletion. Press the unit's button at any time to reset this feature for five more minutes.

The Subcompact V3 easily mounts with a hex drive crossbar screw and features windage adjustment, elevation adjustment and programmable constant on and pulse modes. Additionally, the unit is ideal for left- and -right handed shooters with two separate activation buttons located on the backside of the laser. Not only will the laser fit nicely on the smallest of sub-compact railed pistols, it works great on modern rifles as well.

The Subcompact V3 laser is powered by four 377 batteries that provide five hours in constant on mode and ten hours in pulse mode of normal usage. Normal usage is defined as one minute on and one minute off. This test mimics actual usage where the unit is turned on and off and the battery is given time to automatically regenerate.

When the chips are down and stress is high, a quality laser can make all the difference in making it back home in one piece. Let's face it; bad things usually happen at night in dimly lit areas. When it is happening is not the time to think about the proper sight aids for night time encounters. With LaserLyte Lasers on your side you have the tool necessary to get your hits on target when it matters the most. Grab a LaserLyte and see what you have been missing. 

LaserLyte answers the growing demand for lasers specific to the increasingly popular conceal carry market with the new Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser (CK-AMF). At half the cost of a leading competitor, the CK-AMF fits on the side of the Ruger LCP and the Kel-Tec .380 and .32. Easy to mount on the gun by simply pushing out and replacing the stock pins with the new screws (included). Then push the ergonomic activation button with the index finger and the laser is on target. The CK-AMF design works also as a finger guide that allows for safe trigger control without blocking the laser beam. The programmable laser features a pulse or constant on mode and also has an auto-off function to prevent an unwanted battery drain. The side mounted laser allows the pistol to fit in virtually any nylon pocket holster. The new LaserLyte Ruger LCP Side Mount Laser is compact and light, and foremost: deadly. 

Specifications and Features:
Power Output: Class IIIA, 5mw
Laser module: 650nm
Batteries: 4 x 377 batteries
Battery Life: 5 hours Constant on, 10 hours pulse mode

635,http://www.armslist.com/posts/711635,For Sale/Trade:  german RSI beretta m1935,"westminster, Colorado, United States",$ 495,"Listed On: Tuesday, December 11, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"this beretta pistol was included in a delivery of 65,000 Beretta M1934/35 pistols delivered to the German wehrmacht Headquarters in Italy between Aug 1944 and Feb, 1945. Those serial # were 534000/599000.
After the 8 September 1943 armistice between Italy and the Allies, the Germans saddled Beretta with three engineers from Germany. Moreover the factory was garrisoned by the waffen ss!!! 'armed security service' Weapons of that time, even the ones produced for the Germans, bore the punch mark 4UT, (Quarto Ufficio tecnico di Controllo Armi e Munizioni--4th Technnical Control Unit...
-an C. Still, in Axis Pistols, page 107, states,
""It is likely that almost all of the 4/UT, ...were used by the German Army"". He also includes two other variations in this statement, ""1944 dated and blank slide Model 1935"".
Ugo Menchini, in Pietro Beretta Le Automatiche, regarding an M1934, page 255, states,
""In late 1940 there appears an oval including the punch mark IVU. It refers to the 4th technical Control Unit of the FAG, where inspection was carried out.""
Note that, while they seem to represent the same inspectors, the ""IVU"" is not the same mark as the ""4UT"". The IVU would be found on the pre RSI model M1934, and the 4UT would be found on the RSI model M1935.
These are the reasons why I believe that it is likely that all of the 4UT Berettas WERE RSI pistols!! the IVU and the 4UT were the same office, but under Italian management -the IVU, before the surrender of Italy, and German the 4UT, so after september, 8 1943.........

Mussolini was rescued by German paratroopers led by Otto Skorzeny. He was then installed by the Germans as the President of the Italian Social Republic (RSI). The RSI was to be an Italian regime which was to nominally administer the German-occupied northern Italy. As the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale (MVSN, also known as ""Black Shirts"") was disbanded by the terms of the armistice, the Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana was formed on 24 November 1943. The ""Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana"" was formed out of local police, ex-army, and others still loyal to the fascist cause. 

 Pistol is in near unissued condition with mirror bore , mint! no rust, scuffs, dings,tight action. no import markings! BRINGBACK???? a prime example of strain on axis weapons fabrication late in the war, with tooling and machinery marks throughout, it comes with one extra original period magazine!!!!!!!!

The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or blackened finish. Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

I bought a car to drive back and forth to work (in Cleveland), so this truck is not getting much use. I needed it when I got it, but kids are pretty much grown (both drive). I had glacier grip tires put on it last winter & boy do they grip in snow and on ice! I bought this truck back in 2006 and it has never broken down on us. We do take good care of our vehicles, Make sure all proper maintenance is completed and any preventative maintenance gets done as well. I would not hesitate one bit to take it on a long trip out of state. I have 2 sets of rims and tires for it (summer & winter). Only the winter set set will come with it unless it is the right price ($1000 additional)! The winter set is premium 17 inch wheels that come on the Denalis (glacier grips are mounted to these). The summer set are RVM 22 inch wheels with high performance highway tires on them ($2400 new). I checked Kelly Blue book on this SUV. The value in good condition is $9,385 and trade in was $7290. I bought this truck from a guy who restored it after a tree fell on the hood, busted the motor mounts etc... He restored it no better than new condition, but it still had a salvage title because the insurance company wrote it off when the tree fell on it. He put a custom hood on it, a custom grille on it, added GT badges and painted it black (was Champagne). He did an outstanding job! This was his wife's vehicle to haul their kids around for a few years until they no longer needed something this big. Unfortunately, from sitting around, the wheel wells have started to rust out (It still looks pretty good though). This is why I have it priced so low. My loss is your gain. This will be the best vehicle you have ever owned for winter driving!!!

 It currently has 113121 miles on it. $7500 OBO. Make me an offer. I may consider partial trade for a nice fishing boat, four wheelers, guns etc..., but I am not going to trade even up on something like that. Money talks!

Tubular free-float forearm is made of lightweight, high-strength carbon fiber to reduce heat transfer to the shooter’s hand during sustained fire and provide excellent handling characteristics. Precision-made, aluminum barrel nut rigidly clamps the forearm to the upper receiver. Generous porting on some models enhances heat transfer while reducing weight even more.

KNS Precision Non-Rotating Pin Set:
Redesigned hammer pin and anti-rotation links provide the strongest possible system to eliminate pin rotation. Helps prevent wear to receiver holes, which is especially important for increasingly-valuable M16 and pre-ban receivers. Notched hammer pin locks into slots in the anti-rotation links; trigger is secured with locking screws, and includes lube ports so adequate lubrication reaches the trigger. Anti-rotation links fit on the outside of the receiver to prevent all movement.

Battle Comp 2.0:
Multi-purpose compensator reduces muzzle climb, so you stay on target between shots during rapid fire engagements. Reduces flash signature and produces less concussion than the standard A2 flash hider for a smaller dust signature when shooting prone.

I am not sure if these will sell here but since I would trade for quality firearms I thought I would try here first. If you are a collector or pro musician you will probably know what these are. Carvers are one of the best pro amps and this one like the Furman xover has only been used in my home stereo. They work perfectly! The Carver was sent to the factory for updates several years ago and stored. I have moved to a condo and havent used these in several years now. I had them on a rack so they do have marks but they were used to drive vintage Altecs VOTs so you know thet have never been pushed. I know what these are going for on Ebay so this is a reasonble price. These were made in America not like most of the junk they are selling today. If you don't know what they are then Google to get the full specs.NO low ball offers please. Will trade for vintage Altec or certain rifles
