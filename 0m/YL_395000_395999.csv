It is a custom built Stag Arms Left Handed AR-15 that I had the guys at LaRue Tactical build for me.  I have shot maybe 120-150 rounds through the rifle in the course of the build and in zeroing the ACOG.  I can tell you this is the best firing AR-15 I have ever shot and if you know LaRue Tactical you know the quality of work they do.  The rounds eject on the left side making it perfect for a left handed shooter and everything else is ambidextrious.  The ACOG is crystal clear with zero scratches on the glass and absolutely dead on accurate.    I will admit that the light is not new, and the pressure switch can be finicky at times but everything else is in MINT condition.  What you also dont see is my cost of labor and time for gunsmith.  Along with the build this rifle also had the extractor and bolt carrier group polished and fitted by the guys at LaRue.

With its tapered, floating top rib, ported barrels, five Diamond Grade extended Invector-Plus choke tubes, this gun is going to increase your scores. It has a right-hand palm swell which is a raised area on the right side of the stock, which comfortably fills in your palm. It helps with swing control, follow-through and recoil. The gloss oil finish on the Grade III/IV walnut stock sets this shotgun apart from other sporting guns.

A few days ago,  I had a deal that didn't go through, I decided not to sell to the guy because he felt the need to interrogate me after I told him I was black. Last week on a seperate deal, I drove to OKC on a trade because it was the guys first handgun so I was excited for him, wasted my gas and time only to be asked if I had shot someone with the gun I was trading him. Not cool. So in advance, I am black and from north tulsa, I work fulltime, take care of a family and I have my CC license. That alone is too much info on my part, hate to be a moron but its frustrating. Please don't haggle, I will tell you its sold. I know this is a side job for some to buy guns cheap then sell for more to people who don't know better. AND THOSE WHO FLAGGED MY OTHER POST ABOUT OVER PRICED USED GUNS....NOT COOL EITHER!!

Now about the gun, apparently these are good aks, I seen a few on here selling for 8s and 900s. I didn't pay that much for mine and there's no way I'm going to try to sell it for that much. The serial starts with 93****, I bought it back when lashs gun emporium was still around(where sooner guns is now)in 2006 or 2007. I'm sure it was used, its in good condtition, I took the original stock and foregrip off, didn't like the hole on the stock. I've only shot maybe 100 rounds through it...sits in the safe for the most part. Have 4 mags, 2 clamped together, folding tapco stock, tapco rails, and maybe 350-400 rounds of ammo. Love it but I shoot my ARs more. Not even sure I want to sell it, just want to see what offers or trades would come up. If interested send email and ill try to reply soon as I can, Thanks"

-Must be 40 caliber
-Must be an autoloader (no wheel guns)
-Must include at least 2 magazines.
-Acceptable manufacturers include: Glock, Sig, HK, S&W, Springfield, CZ, Walther, and Beretta
-450 is the maximum I will offer for an pistol that interests me, but for any handgun, that is offered, I expect to pay less than dealer pricing. 

Im not looking for firearms by any other manufacturers.

*One last requirement- I will travel no farther than Portland from the Mt. Hood villages so you must be able to work with me on a meeting spot convenient for both of us.*

My preference is a Glock 23 and night sights are a huge plus, but I will entertain all offers that meet my criteria. I will listen to offers for a couple of days before I remove my post and either choose my favorite or visit my local dealer. Thank you very much!"

At least 2 are GI issue, I think. Unknown on the others. Also includes a pretty decent DeSantis leather belt holster (worn but perfectly functional, with thumb snap), a decent Bianchi rigid nylon holster and a pretty ratty Bianchi nylon double mag pouch.

I just acquired this gun in a trade. It's been carried far more than it's been shot. It's got standard GI-type sights...no dots. The bore is in EXCELLENT condition but there's some holster wear on the exterior of the gun. The finish rates about 90+%. There was an ""idiot"" mark under the slide lock lever but I put some cold-blue touch up on it. Mechanically this gun is sound. I fired about 5 mags through it today with various brands of hollow point and ball ammo and it functioned flawlessly. Cleaned after shooting. The insides show some wear but everything looks solid.

This is a fair deal on a nice, solid Colt Commander."

Check out the videos on YouTube of the power of the Taurus Judge..For home protection..or Truck protection if you work over the road.. its in a class of its own.Heres a example..  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttFslPwNEuc

It is a SA/DA semi auto pistol that has very low recoil characteristics.  I purchased it from a member about 2 months ago.  I love the gun but am looking for something smaller and lighter to carry. (XD SubCompact, Walther PPS, SW Shield and any other firearms)

Unsure of the round count but since I've owned it, it has only 50 rounds down range. No FTE/FTF.  I've cleaned the gun after every range trip.  I just confirmed with the previous owner that the gun has less than 500 rounds between us. 

The CZ 85 incorporates ambidextrous features into the basic CZ 75 platform including RH and LH safety and slide stop levers as well as a reversible mag release. The B model has a firing pin block safety that restricts any movement of the firing pin until the trigger is pulled. This mechanism prevents discharge in the event that a dropped pistol lands on its muzzle with enough force that the inertia of the firing pin overcomes the firing pin spring enough to touch off the primer.

It comes with two 16 round mags, original box and accessories.

Tac-S

The gun is very accurate for an AK pattern rifle, and it also features a chrome lined barrrel (16""). Besides the bolt assembly, all the internals have been replaced with Tapco parts in order to remain 922r compliant. The gun features a G2 trigger group (polished by Dinzag Arms, the trigger pull is significantly better than standard AK's). I put a Tapco retaining plate in the gun, and the trigger guard is from Dinzag Arms. All of the holes which remained from conversion are filled with nylon plugs, also from Dinzag. The rear stock and pistol grip are by Tapco, and the gun features a tactical fore end (rail system) which also will retain a solid zero if optics are installed. The gun has had a Dinzag bullet guide installed...for those unfamiliar with Saiga rifles this is a feature which is necessary for high capacity magazines. I'm including the factory Saiga magazine with the gun, but aftermarket high capacity mags can be used with this rifle (I can't guarantee a drop in fit with every mag, some may need minor fitting to properly seat). The dust cover has been replaced by a mil spec ribbed version."

Item Description: Known as the 38 safety hammerless or ""lemon squeezer""

FUNCTIONAL INFO:
 The gun itself is in excellent conditon. It doesn't appear to have been fired a whole lot. 

The rifling is strong. Cylinder lock-up is excellent with no play. The top-latch is tight with no wiggle. 

DETAIL INFO:
 Took a trip by S&W forum and they tell me nickel finish has either been redone or someone finished the parts that are not nickel finished stock i.e. the trigger and top break latch. They also informed me that it is a safety hammerless fourth model which basically means it is more of a shooter and not ""ultra collectable"" like a safety hammerless first model would be. The fact that its a shooter is why the price is as such because if it was a first model they tend to demand more of a premium."

I have a very nice Trapper, 16"" barrel with saddle ring. It's chambered in .45LC. It shows a few dings from being stored/moved around in a safe. Nothing serious. The barrel is clean, bright and shiny. The pictures pretty well show the condition of this gun. The action shows very little wear and the screws haven't been messed with.

Also, this sale will include almost 300 rounds of factory .45LC ammo. There's 224 rounds of Remington 250gr LRN (bulk packed in an ammo can), one 20-round box of Win 255gr LRN, and 49 rounds of assorted HP ammo (CCI, Win Silvertip, Remington). This has got to be over $200 just in ammo!

This Colt is in VERY GOOD condition. It's all original and never been messed with. It's in the original box with the owner's manual. It includes 1 original Colt magazine plus 9 other mags from various sources. At least 2 are GI issue, I think. Unknown on the others. Also includes a pretty decent DeSantis leather belt holster (worn but perfectly functional, with thumb snap), a decent Bianchi rigid nylon holster and a pretty ratty Bianchi nylon double mag pouch.

I just acquired this gun in a trade. It's been carried far more than it's been shot. It's got standard GI-type sights...no dots. The bore is in EXCELLENT condition but there's some holster wear on the exterior of the gun. The finish rates about 90+%. There was an ""idiot"" mark under the slide lock lever but I put some cold-blue touch up on it. Mechanically this gun is sound. I fired about 5 mags through it today with various brands of hollow point and ball ammo and it functioned flawlessly. Cleaned after shooting. The insides show some wear but everything looks solid.

This is a fair deal on a nice, solid Colt Commander."

(This will not fit a bull barrel or Sendero model)  Color is Tan with Black Web.  Aluminum bedded, perfect fit, and it is a gorgeous stock.  I ordered the stock and used it for a season, then I sold my Remington with the original stock on it.  This one is like brand new, just cheaper.  The bedding will increase your accuracy & the stock will reduce recoil and weight.  As an added benefit, it's extremely durable and scratch resistant and will make your rifle one-of-a-kind and really dresses the model 700 up.
