The SKS is a heavy duty Soviet semi-automatic rifle chambered for the 7.62x39mm round.  This one has been adapted to use detachable magazines and comes with a 20rnd and 30rnd steel magazine.  It also has a muzzle brake and flash suppressor bedded and pined.  The upper wood hand guard was replaced with a steel vented guard for additional cooling of the gas system.  It has the chrome lined barrel.  The stock was sanded down and four coats of polyurethane were applied to really bring out the hardwood grain.  The bayonet lug was removed to allow CA legal use of the detachable magazines and brake/flash suppressor.  Only about 200 rounds of non-corrosive ammo was shot through this rifle.

I don't want to, but sometimes you just do what you have to do. This is a great stock. It is very solid, comfortable and shoots wonderfully. It has an adjustable cheek rest and a 6 position, side-folding,  butt stock. The sliding stock and the folding mechanism can be locked out. It was solid and accurate and my old Mini was doing 1.5 inches at 100 yards with it. That's not bad. 

Also included is a stock drop adapter to lower the butt stock for better shooting with iron sights, and the ATI Aluminum buffer upgrade kit. That includes the adapter, the bolt, the castle nut and the locking ring. Just add the tube of your choice, and whatever butt stock you want.  About 40 bucks on its own.

I'm only selling it because I don't want to pin it, so, I went in a more traditional direction.

So, the stock and all the parts that came with it, including the rails, swivel attachments etc - in the original box AND the aluminum upgrade kit for $100. 

Shipping if needed is additional.  FTF is fine.

I'll take cash, PP discreet gift, or POMO.  (The stock is also listed on other sites, so I reserve the right to end this listing at any time if I sell the stock elsewhere.?

So, what do you say?  Give a great stock a good home."

I am looking or a cash offer or a trade for an AR15,  Desert Eagle, or any old cowboy guns  I had some interest by collectors and had the gun checked out and that's when I realized it didn not have the orginal barrel.  The original barrels on these (pre 1920) were all blued.  The barrel in mine is still early (pre series 70) but it is milled.  That does bring the collectible value down a bit, but doesn't kill it by any means.  I will take a reasonable cash offer or trade. This 1911 is close to 100 years old and in outstanding condition and the pre series 70's as we all know are hard to find anymore....especially in good shape.  I just don't shoot it anymore and my interests have changed from the older military weapons to the newer fancier ones.  I always will love the old western stuff..guess thats the kid in me coming out.  It's been in my safe for years, no rusting pitting, not even being fired, just cleaned twice a year.

This is actually a bigger gun than a 1911.  S&W does not make these kind of all stainless steel guns anymore.  Recoil actually feels less than a subcompact 9mm.  I could shoot it all day if I could afford the ammo.

Tritium night sights are faded a bit but still visible.  This is a later model as it has the blued trigger and hammer.

I just purchased 2 extra 8rnd mags from S&W and will include with Gun for a total of 3 magazines.  Comes with new nylon belt holster as well.
Shoots great and will eat anything you throw at it.  It will even feed empty cases loaded into the magazine.  This gun has a reputation for 100% reliability.

I will include original grip, but I just put a Hogue rubber grip on it and it is only a couple weeks old.

Looking to sell or trade my Springfield Armory XDm.  This is the 4.5"" barreled model chambered in 9x19 parabellum/9mm Luger.  I bought this gun roughly a year ago for personal protection and plinking.  I have put about 500 rounds through the gun and have taken meticulous care of it.  About two months ago I began purchasing a few upgrades for the gun with the hopes of entering some local shooting competitions.  Currently installed on the gun is a FULL Springer Precision Trigger Kit (new trigger bar, sear, springs).  This kit allows for a 50% reduction in trigger travel and a 25% reduction in trigger pull weight.  Also recently installed are Dawson Precision sights.  The rear is fully adjustable for windage and elevation and is serrated black.  The front is matching height fiber optic (comes with red installed, green can be installed and is included).  Excellent sights and trigger allow for rapid, accurate shooting.  The last upgrade is a Springer Precision weighted guide rod.  The added weight in the front of the gun allows for less recoil and faster followup shots.  Also included with the gun is the full set of XDGear and the hard case.  This set includes a paddle holster, dual magazine holster (not pictured but included), speed loader, coil lock, cleaning swab, 2 (19) round magazines, and manual.  Also included are ALL stock parts so the gun can be converted back to normal if desired.  I am listing this firearm at a loss and would much prefer to trade if the right trade comes along.  Additional pictures can be taken upon request.

with a raised Trillion Cut( http://www.diamondsonweb.com/information/trillion-cut-diamonds.mhtml ) Center stone .4 Carats. Can you say big?
All stones are eye clean and I was unable to see inclusions with a 10X jewelers loop. Not a professional so I won't try and tell you the actual clarity measurements. Center stone is complimented by 7 .085 carat (approx) diamonds in channel setting positioned with the corners up and down so they all touch corners in a a line. There is even a diamond under the main stone that increases the incredible fire the main stone already has. Ring comes with a Lifetime Rhodium plating and diamond warranty from Kay Jewelers. This is very useful being that a rhodium dip is around $30 right now and the average ring needs dipped every 6 months of wear to keep the luster. That alone saves you $60 a year that is $600 in ten years!!! This ring was a limited production ""showcase ring"" very few of these were made by Kay Jewelers, very hard to find another like it. Would hold onto it but my wife wants to take up shooting as a hobby so we are looking to get some start up cash to do so. If you want to see the ring we can meet at Kays in the mall or another similar neutral place. More pics available."

To make a long story short, after I turned 21 I tried out quite a few of the lower-end handguns over a few years (didn't have the budget for a more expensive model at the time) and this is the only one I still have at 27.  Most of the other models constantly failed to eject/load/fire and caused me lots of issues, but this gun has been very reliable.  I've put probably 500+ rounds through it and always cleaned it thoroughly to ensure it maintains maximum reliability.

It's a dark good starter handgun or plinker, very solid construction and has always treated me well.  Simply enough, I have hit a financial difficulty in my life and need to sell some extra 'toys.'  I'm asking $150 for the gun, factory magazine, and about 35rnds of ammunition but I will entertain serious cash offers if I am able to get rid of it by this weekend.  Face-to-face transfers with ID somewhere in the St Louis metro area and please, no low-ballers.  While I do need to sell, $75 would just be insulting.

In the late 19th century Persia/Iran was conflicted ground between several nations and Russia being amongst them. The Russians trained several units of Persian Cossack Calvery which in turn was lead by Russian officers. The Persian 1881 saber is a direct replica of the Russian saber in service at that time.

The one i picked up: All number matching, on scabboard, blade, and hilt. Dints and some rusts on the scabboard but i'll leave it to the collectors to clean it off. The blade has NOT been sharpened which is interesting, perhaps this was never used?

The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art. The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles. Quad rail, Troy Industries flip-up sights, chrome bolt/carrier and barrel. Trijicon ACOG TA01NSN Designed to the exact specifications of the US Special Operations Command for use by elite US forces, the Trijicon ACOG TA01NSN is Trijicon’s most popular ACOG. The ranging reticle allows for bullet drop compensation out to 600 meters without any manual adjustments. The reticle will appear black during the daytime and will glow amber in the dark, thanks to Trijicon’s patented tritium illumination. Includes backup Iron Sights. No batteries needed!"

GREAT CARRY CONCEAL GUN. This gun is extremely clean. The grip has been stippled to increase grip purchase, reduce muzzle flip, and allow for quicker follow up shots. This stipple job was done right and follows the factory grip pattern. For those not familiar with this type of custom work, it's like putting skate board tape or grip tape on your gun except it never peels or wears out. It also insures you retain positive control of your weapon no matter what. You can literally coat your hand in oil and still get a good grip on this pistol. Pistol comes with everything shown and functions flawlessly. I got it on another trade and did not like the way it felt in my hand; during my last range visit. It chewed through 100 rounds of 9mm with zero failures or issues and would make a great carry conceal gun as it has no magazine safety( means you can fire it with out the mag in) a second strike trigger, and skinny profile.

I am selling this weapon because I will be leaving the country for 2 yrs and dont think it should be just sitting in the closet for that time. I bought the Gun in Feb of 2011 and have shot it a few times, 150 Rounds max. It has a block frot end with a Troy from sight witch can be removed if you like. It has a Mag Pul pop up rear sight. It also comes with the Eotech XPS2 sight, it was used when I got it but still works great. If you have any questions pleases call or text me at REDACTED I do not use the computer and am constantly busy so the phone is the only way to get ahold of me.

Want to trade an (unfired) Sig limited edition. It's a P226R Gadsden 1 of 1776 made in honor of the tea party movement. It has factory night sights, 2 mags and all the promotional tea party material that came from the factory.

MSRP on the Sig is $1200.00 but Bud's online has one for $875.00 so I would accept $825.00 cash for mine. For $900.00 I will include a new leather holster ($100.00 value)."

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. This P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with Rosewood grips for comfort and beauty as well as a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast or SIGLITE Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly.

If you would like to become familar with guns and how to safely operate them and would like some coaching then I could provide that service for you as an informal coach.

I have years of informal training with handguns, rifles, and shotguns and have competed for fun as well.

I can familarize you with your own firearm or alternately ranges allow some weapons rentals where you could choose various styles.

You would pay additional range, ammunition, safety glasses, and hearing protection rental fees should you want to visit a range to shoot.  It's your choice as to how far you want to go.

Otherwise, I would just charge an hourly rate with a minimum charge ($60).

While I would coach you on safe use and function of firearms I would not address the legal question of when to use a firearm to defend yourself.  That would be the subject for another teacher.  My efforts would focus on proper knowledge, firearm function, and shooter form and thinking.

This is a Bushmaster 14.5"" heavy barreled upper (still lighter than my BCM 16"" middy). It is chrome lined in bore and chamber and magnetic particle inspected. 1 in 9"" twist, 5.56 chamber. A2 receiver with fixed carry handle, CAR handguards. Permanently attached Yankee Hill Machine flash hider. It is a rock solid upper, the only downfall to it is whoever permanently attached the flash hider didn't do it very neat as there is visible weld. I will take pictures as soon as I get my camera back this weekend. Not sure on round count, but the bore and chamber looks great. It shoots and functions flawlessly, this upper goes for $565 on Bushmasters website. I believe the model number for this upper from Bushmaster is: BURA2B 14.5

It will come complete with the bolt and carrier as I do not like to mix match bolts.

Great gun, accurate and reliable. I bought this when I was a youngin' because ammunition was cheap and that made it a fun gun for the range.

I had originally purchased a case of ammunition with the gun - I had shot most of it (which would be about how many rounds have been through the gun total). Somehow, the last few hundred round, case - and my other stuff that was in the case - vanished. When I went to price getting more ammo for the thing I was a bit shocked at how much it has gone up.

There are requirements of buying this.  You must provide a valid drivers license.  There will be a typed contract for buyers and sellers eyes only.  There will be the Names of the both parties, Gun Make, Model, and serial number, dates, and signitures of both parties.  This is just in case something illegal was to happen with this weapon once it leaves my hands.  I will not be held responsible.  This is a must.  No exceptions.

Since I have over $660.00 in this weapon, and its discontinued, and NEVER BEEN FIRED.  The price Im asking is not to bad.  The price is Firm.  I may consider a trade, but ONLY for a Glock 27 .40 caliber in GOOD shape, or a Glock 36 .45 caliber in GOOD shape.  Nothing else.
