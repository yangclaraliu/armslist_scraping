This is the first shotgun I've owned, I bought it last summer. The idea was camping protection now that I have kids and they come camping with us. But, unfortunetely, I need the money for bills rather than a gun not being used sitting around the house. It is all black, no extra attachments other than the 5 shell holder on the tactical stock, and has only been fired on one weekend, after it was first purchased. I bought it brand new, and it is legally registered.  The restricter was taken out so it will hold 5 shells, 6 if you chamber one (for sake of being responsible, don't chamber one, lol). I won't deliver but I do want the transaction to be legal, so I will have a transaction note in order to transfer the weapon to you, I've never sold a gun before so I'll have to figure out what exactly is to be done about that.

This drum attaches to the rifle exactly like a normal clip. No alterations to the rifle are required. Simply drop in all 75 rounds of ammo, close the cover, wind up the spring, and you are ready to fire. A wind-up drum is a great way to store a loaded magazine long-term without the worry of a compressed spring loosing its ability to deliver enough push to empty a magazine. With the drum, you don't wind up the spring until you are ready to use the drum.

Will consider trades

Please see list for other possible trades. I bought this gun for one reason - Self Defense, the reason this gun is made in the first place. This is the Self Defense model (SD40VE) NOT the Sigma, this is updated from the Sigma. This gun is almost IDENTICAL to a Glock, same take-down, same trigger, striker fired, same overall design for the whole firearm. Only problem is, my wife lost interest. This gun if flawless. Functions perfectly, only been shot a few times and still looks factory brand new. I have two 14 round magazines for it, the factory lock along with all paperwork and the factory box. This is a great gun for a beginner or for an addition to a collection. The polymer frame makes for a great, light gun that is easy to shoot. Being a self defense model, there is no manual safety (there is a trigger break safety) just like a Glock. Some people don't like that it has no safety, it makes sense to me since it is for one purpose, self defense. I personally like the gun for what it is, just looking for something different. Would be willing to add cash on my end for a better make/model, or accept cash/partial trade DEPENDS WHAT YOU HAVE!!! Contact me and we will go from there, worst I can do is say no thank you.

Alexander Arms / Sabre Defense have developed many special weapons for the US army, including the 6.5 Grendel AR 15 platform which the US Army uses for sniping in Iraq and Afghanistan, they also developed the .50 Beowulf which the Army uses to stop suicide bombers ad their vehicles in Iraq and Afghanistan.

They developed the .21 Genghis in response to Special Forces request for a weapon chambered in 5.45x39. 5.45x39 is the round fired by the AK 74 rifle. This was the standard rifle of the Soviet Union, that is what they carried during their invasion of Afghanistan and it is the preferred cartridge of the Afghan Muja rebels even to this day. It is also used by the Iraqi and Afghan armies and is the most plentiful round found in the Middle East. Special forces wanted a reliable weapon which they could use in the field without having the carry a lot of ammo for it. The trouble with 5.56 nato was no opposing forces carried it in their rifles, so the US forces had to carry their ammo with them, once they ran out they either needed resupply or they were done for. In the mountains of Afghanistan resupply is not always a feasible alternative. However, there was plenty of 5.45x39 ammo lying around on the dead Taliban fighters, so the US special forces could always get that ammo. That is why Alexander Arms developed the AR in that cartridge. They are the only ones in the world to make an AR 15 rifle in that cartridge.

You are bidding on a full rifle which was made by Alexander Arms in 5.45x39, it is not just an upper on a standard receiver, the whole rifle came from Alexander Arms, as the receiver markings with testify. They started with a Rock River M4 Operator and converted it to 5.45x39. The advantage of the caliber in the US is that the market is awash with surplus Russian ammo, even true AP ammo. You can still buy this ammo for $100 per 1080 rounds, no other powerful rifle ammo is available in this price range. The ammo also has plenty of choices to select when buying, including the cheapest which is real AP steel core Russian surplus bullets, unlike the US made M855 Penetrators in 5.56 which only have a steel tip, the Russian AP ammo is truly AP, and will go through even Level IV vests with armor plates. The rifle does not have a flash hider because it was made to be mated with a silencer, since I live in the People’s Republic of Illinois and Obamas home district, no silencers are allowed here so nothing was ever mounted on the muzzle. However, a muzzle break can be mounted on the cheap by any competent gunsmith. The rifle also comes with factory box and papers, the box is a reinforced metal combination case which is extremely heavy and sturdy."

GOD Loves you ALL, and So Do We

John 3:16-17 1611 KJV
3:16    For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 
3:17    For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 

1. THE ROMANS' MAP TO HEAVEN
Would you like to be a Christian ? If you knew what God says about becoming a Chrsitian, would you do it ?

2. WHERE SIN CAME FROM
ROMANS 5:12
Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon men, for all that have sinned:

3. GOD'S PRICE ON SIN
ROMANS 6:23
For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

4. OUR WAY OUT
ROMANS 5:8
But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

5. WHO HAS SINNED?
ROMANS 3:23
For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God:

ROMANS:3:10
As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:

7. ROMANS 10:13
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

8. ROMANS 10:9-11
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with thee heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."

Based on a long lineage of straight pull bolt action rifles, beginning with the Schmidt-Rubin Model 1889. Rubin designed the bullet that was combined with Schmidt's straight pull bolt rifle. 

A very accurate, detachable magazine fed rifle with a very unique straight pull bolt that allowed the soldier to quickly chamber rounds by pulling straight back on the bolt and then slamming it forward. Very revolutionary engineering in a battle rifle for the late 1800's. Because of the straight pull bolt technology the Swiss soldier did not have to raise up (exposing themselves to enemy fire) and chamber a round, like a standard turn-bolt rifle. 
this rifle is the most accurate surplus rifle i have shot.
 it is in excellent shape, it has the typical scratches and dings in the stock you see in these rifles.
 the bluing is in excellent shape also.
 bore is mirror and crown is excellent.
 if you want one of the most accurate surplus rifles there is,the swiss engineering of these rifles are amazing.

The only mod I made was the pistol grip, but I still have the original pistol grip in case you want everything to be as it was. You also have the owners manual, the sling, the 5 round magazine, and 3x aftermarket 30 round magazines. You also get the gun case for it and about 200 rounds of ammo. 

It shoots like a dream. For those that don't know, these are amongst the highest quality AK's you can get. These were built in Egypt, but the factory was set up by the Russians, so everything is up to spec of the original AK's.

Here's the story, I've had a couple of heart surgeries and now I have a 45 lb. weight restriction. If I am ever able to hunt again I will have to have a bow with around a 45 lbs. draw. Really that is only reason I'm getting rid of these bows.... So here's the deal I found a couple of bows I would like, so if I can sale these two fairly quick........., I'll take $50.00 each.

THE FIRST BOW; I have is a Bear Kodiak compound bow. This is an older bow but I really like it and I have used it several years and never had a problem with it but it has a 65 lb. draw. I have contacted Bear Archery and they said there is a way I could lower it about another 10 lbs. But that's still too much for me.

This bow has a sight with 3 brass pins an adjustable arrow rest a peep sight with tubing, whisker string silencers, a kisser button and a set of noc's to align arrow each time. 

THE SECOND BOW; is a Ben Pearson bushmaster compound bow. This bow has a 60 lb. draw weight. This bow has the flexible tubing, nocking points, peep sight and whisker string silencers and a set of noc's to align arrow each time...

THE THIRD BOW; is a Browning Vortex compound bow. This bow has a 55 or 60 lb. draw weight. (This bow is adjustable but it’s not marked on the bow, so I’m just guessing). This bow has the nocking points, peep sight and whisker string silencers and a set of noc's to align arrow each time but not flexible tubing.


I WOULD PREFER TO TRADE THESE TO BOWS WITH A 45 LB. DRAW.  I would trade to one 30/35 lb. compound/recurve  to use for bow fishing, other than that asking $50.00 each for the bows.

I have 5 (1 per....patriot) new black P-Mags (getting more as we speak) with windows that I will GIVE to  people that can prove (discribed below) that they in some way, shape, or form have performed actions to protect our 2nd Amendment and hopefully will continue to do so beyond just the free gift. 

I'm not ask you to make this a second job, just a few minutes here and there. There are free links on sites like Ruger and other manufacturers. Also the NRA, GOA, and other groups to contact officials. And you don't need to be a member. What I'm asking is easy to do but truly needs to be done. The fact that you opened this ad proves it. A couple months ago you probably would not have been on this site. Or even cared about a $19 magazine. Times show that we are in troubled times as law abiding gun owners.

All over the country small groups of socialists and Obama-nites have bickered and had little marches to take away right many people (including myself) have fought and died to give us and protect for us. Based on the foolish concept that taking away the rights of law abiding americans will stop crime, or the gun has everything to do with violence. You and I both know that makes as much sense as blaming a car for a hit and run. 

If thats the case they need to let James Holmes (Aroura CO) go,  add Adam Lanza (Sandy Hook) to the list of innocent victims, and forgive James Earl Ray (shot MLK)... No, stupid, of course not they are guilty as they come. But they wont waste a second to punish... YOU!

But then I also notice how many gun owners flock to the stores and hoard every AR, AR mag, bullets and anything else they heard about on last nights new. I saw a guy looking for ANY gun that took a clip! "" Does that gun take a clip? it looks like it might take a clip. Its a bolt action and takes a clip, I dont know what that means."" Oddly enough he walk right past the M1 Garand, the only gun in the store that actually used a clip.

Its like Black Friday on semi-auto and hi-cap gun sales. morons running around buying everything they see in pure panic because they are afraid they will never get to have one again. People online selling things at extreme prices (I was almost one of them until I thought about right and wrong, and I was ashamed of myself for thinking it) with buyers on their and waiting in line to pay the price.

Yet what I don't see enough of is Americans willing to stand up and fight for their rights. Most choose too run around in panic and fear, not willing to send a single email, or write a letter, or make a phone call. They say ""I dont get involved in politics"" while they are hoping to god you sell them your AR-15 because they probably will never get one soon. When the fact is that if they would get involved we wouldn't be in this mess. SIMPLY BEING A MEMBER OF THE GOA OR THE NRA IS NOT ENOUGH! WE PERSONALLY NEED TO BE IN OUR REPS LIVES AS OFTEN AS WE CAN!

I should not have to do this, it should be second nature for an Americans to fight for the freedoms that are god given right.  But if its what it takes to get Americans attention I will continue to do this. When I run out of P-mags to give away I will find something else to give. I hope (but not counting) that this will make people open their eyes and it will motive more then 5 people. 

I do believe our country is changing for the wrose. Many things need to change and many people need help. But adding laws to stop criminals is a fools dream. They tried a ban before and it did nothing. Please I beg of you! take action to protect what is yours, mine, and our children. 

START FIGHTING TO KEEP WHAT IS OURS, DON'T STOP FIGHTING, AND FIGHT HARD!
EVERY TIME YOU SEE SOME GROUP WALKING AROUND WITH SIGNS ABOUT NEW LAWS OR TAKING OUR GUNS IT SHOULD BURN JUST A LITTLE BIT. BECAUSE THEY ARE SMILING EAR TO EAR ABOUT TAKING A RIGHT AWAY FROM US. 

ITS ABOUT CONTROL AND WHO THEY WANT TO HAVE IT. THE 2ND AMENDMENT, GUN OWNERSHIP, HI-CAP MAGS, SEMI AUTO FIREARMS ARE NOT A SIGNS OF WHO HAS POWER. BUT TAKING ONE RIGHT IS ONLY A STEPPING STONE TO SOMETHING ELSE. TODAY THE WANT YOUR HI CAP MAGS, NO BIG DEAL TO MOST. TOMORROW YOUR SEMI AUTO FIREARMS, THEN YOUR RIGHT TO CARRY, OWN IN YOUR HOME... THEN OWN AT ALL ONE DAY. AND WHILE THEY DO THAT SOMEONE WILL START KNOCKING AT SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE IT. IT SOUNDS CRAZY BUT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE... WHY NOT TAKE THE GUNS? WHY NOT TAX A CERTAIN CHURCH? WHY NOT MAKE SOME WORDS ILLEGAL (IT ALL SOUND SILLY BUT I'VE SEEN ALL THESE THING HAPPEN WITH MY OWN EYES, I'VE BEEN AROUND). 

IT ALL HAS TO START SOMEWHERE... SO LETS FIGHT IT WHERE IT STARTS AND KEEP WHAT IS OURS.

!!!!ALL 5 MAGS ARE ON HOLD FOR PEOPLE SENDING IN PROOF. I'M TRYING TO GET MORE PMAGS SO PLEASE BEAR WITH ME.... KEEP FIGHTING AND SENDING ME YOUR EMAILS. I'LL GET MORE MAGS SOON. IF I HAVE TO START PASSING OUT $20 BILLS I WILL. I WILL GET SOME KIND OF FIREARM ITEMS TO GIVE AWAY !!!


If you have questions or comments please feel free to ask or email me your comments.

 READ THIS TOO!!!

****IF YOU DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE 2ND AMENDMENT, RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND YOU JUST WANT A FREE P-MAG TO SELL OR HOARD OR THROW IN YOUR PILE OF OTHER MAGS PLEASE (I BEG YOU)  MOVE ALONG. I'M DOING THIS TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE AND EDUCATE IN HOPES THAT THEY PASS THE INFORMATION TO OTHERS. AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT WELL AFTER THIS ISSUE AND THE FREE MAGAZINE, AND LEARN THAT ITS IMPORTANT TO STAND UP FOR ALL OF OUR RIGHTS. I'M DOING THIS WITH MY OWN MONEY, MY OWN TIME. AND I'M NOT MADE OF EITHER.
 IF YOUR DON'T THINK YOUR THE TYPE THAT CAN REALLY PUT THEIR HEART IN TO THIS PLEASE SAVE WHAT RESOURCES I HAVE FOR SOMEONE ELSE. THANK YOU."

Criteria: I would like one that has all matching numbers and all original equipment that is usually included with a Mosin-Nagant. I am still open to rifles that have mixed numbers but I won't pay as much. I am looking for something that is able to shoot accurate and has little to no damage with no missing parts. I do not want a rifle that has been cut down or modified that can not be reversed. I want to be able to see the rifle in person before the actual purchase of the rifle.

If you are going to offer to sell me your Mosin-Nagant please include the year it was manufactured and the brand if possible, the model of the rifle, how much if any damage the rifle has, what is included, and how much you want. Please let me know if it does not meet any of the criteria listed above. I would also like recent pictures of the rifle. Depending on the condition of the rifle and what is included I am prepared to pay up to $300 possibly more if I think it is worth it.

I am willing to drive 1 hour from my location to look at a rifle. If you are a serious seller and the deal is good enough I might drive further. I am also able to drive to the Richmond, Indiana are if you are willing to ship the rifle to my local gun shop."

I'm selling my beloved FNS-9, moving up my inventory from 9mm to .45acp.
Initially, I was in the market to buy a Glock 19 however, I found the FNS9 to have offered more while still having an optimal trigger that is often difficult to replicate Glock's.
It's a very ergonomic pistol for shooters with small hands, such as myself, and there is also interchangeable back-strap for those with larger hands.
1911 style grip angle with thumb safety as well, not very common on striker fired pistols; this is if you choose to use it, I was going to carry this in condition 1, however I lacked a holster to even do so.
I'm parting ways now to save on the cost of this recent ammo fiasco and just strictly staying with .45acp

It shoots very accurate with no malfunctions. Being the 2013 Golden Bullseye Award Winner in the pistols category; I didn't expect any less.

Here's what you get
-FNS-9, LNIB condition, only 50 rounds through it of West Coast Armory white box.
*matte stainless finish, the rarer of the two avaliable options.
*comes with 3 high capacity magazines, 17 round
*slim and thick backstraps
*comes with Trijicon night sights!
*original box and papers/ lock

The only trades I'm open to are a Baby Eagle in 45ACP, SIG P220 SAO, or Officer (4"") 1911's
Looking especially for a Springfield Champion Operator.
Cash +/- on mine or your part.

Samsung xe500c21-a01US Series 5 Wi-Fi Chromebook (Titan Silver)

Innovatively designed to go as long as you can, the Samsung Chromebook Series 5 lets you spend the whole day surfing, streaming, and working on the web on just one charge. With less than 10-second booting and an amazing 8.5 hours of battery life, the light and sleek Chromebook Series 5 gives you the ultimate web experience that you won't find on any other laptop.
Samsung Chromebook
Search for the best web experience and you'll find the new Samsung Chromebook Series 5 (see larger image).

The Chrome-based operating system features a streamlined user interface, making it easier for you to navigate the web--where you already spend most of your computing time. All your apps, documents, and settings are stored safely in the cloud. Every Chrome notebook runs millions of web apps, from games to spreadsheets to photo editors. And the Samsung Chromebook uses advanced technology to help prevent malware and viruses from accessing your data without you ever having to lift a finger.

This Samsung Chromebook in Titan Silver features a 12.1-inch LED-backlit display with an anti-reflective screen. It's powered by a next-generation, dual-core Intel processor, which combines performance and energy efficiency to provide new levels of support for applications like games, as well as Adobe Flash technology for improved access to multimedia sites such as YouTube and Hulu. Weighing in at 3.3 pounds, the ultra compact design provides maximum portability without compromising on functionality and optimal performance

You'll be able to connect to ultra-fast Wireless-N networks in your home or office, and it includes two USB ports, a 4-in-1 memory card reader, buttonless touchpad with multi-gesture support, and a 1-megapixel webcam for video chats and snapping pics for social networking sites.

Chromebook Features
Instant On

The Samsung Chromebook gets you on the web as quickly as possible. It boots in less than 10 seconds and resumes instantly from sleep. Open the lid, and you're back on the web so you don't miss a beat. And Chromebooks are designed to get faster over time as updates are released.
Find Your Next Favorite Web App

Every Chromebook runs millions of web apps, from games to spreadsheets to photo editors. Thanks to the power of HTML5, many apps keep working even in those rare moments when you're not connected. To try the latest apps, visit the Chrome Web Store or just type in a URL. You can easily create shortcuts on your new tab page to launch your favorite web applications, so that you can enhance your online experience. No CDs required.
Simplicity in Sync

Chromebooks keep your apps, documents, favorites and settings safely in the cloud. That means you can login to a friend's Chomebook and access your profile without disturbing theirs. Or, if you lose or break your Chromebook you have nothing to worry about. Just get another and login, you will be back up and running in minutes like nothing happened.
Forever Fresh

Your Chromebook gets better and better over time, unlike a traditional PC. When you turn it on, it updates itself. Automatically. All of your apps stay up-to-date, and you get the latest and greatest version of the operating system without having to think about it. Annoying update prompts not included.

PowerPlus provides up to 8.5 hours of uninterrupted use.
Friends Let Friends Log In

Chromebooks are easy to share with family and friends. They can log in to experience all of their own Chrome settings, apps and extensions, or use a Guest session to browse privately. Either way, no one else using your Chromebook will have access to your email and personal data.
Built-in Security

Chromebooks run the first operating system designed from the ground up to defend against the ongoing threat of malware and viruses. They employ the principle of ""defense in depth"" to provide multiple layers of protection, including sandboxing, data encryption, and verified boot. Websites load quickly and smoothly and all your apps, documents, and settings are stored safely in the cloud.
Hardware Features
SuperBright LED Display

The anti-reflective 12.1-inch LED display has a mirror effect and produces the sharpest images with 300-nit brightness, which is up to 40 percent brighter than normal laptops. Get outstanding picture quality and text readability, even when you're outdoors. Enjoy the web longer without straining your eyes.
Wireless-N Wi-Fi

It's easy to get connected to the Web with built-in Wi-Fi, which is compatible with ultra-fast Wireless-N networks (802.11n) as well as backward compatible with older networks (802.11b/g). As your Chromebook boots up, it quickly connects to your favorite wireless network so you're on the web right from the start.


Chromebook ports
Easy-to-Use Full-Sized Keyboard

Make the most of the web by using a keyboard that's designed for it. Your Chromebook comes equipped with a dedicated search key, a new row of web-enabled keys, and a comfortable, full-size layout that doesn't cramp your fingers so you can get more done and make fewer errors.
Longer Battery Lifespan with PowerPlus

Samsung's intelligent battery charging technology enables the battery to keep 80 percent of its original capacity for up to 1,000 recharges--more than 3x longer than a typical battery. This makes our batteries more economical and environmentally friendly since fewer batteries need to be replaced over the lifecycle.
