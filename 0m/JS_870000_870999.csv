The Sig Sauer 556 SCM is a semi-automatic centerfire rifle made by the SigArms company in Exeter, NH. The gas-piston system of this rifle is similar to the AK-47, it uses a gas port forward in the barrel to force a long piston op-rod backwards; discharging the casing and loading a new round.

It’s chambered in .223/5.56mm and has a 1 in 7″ twist rate barrel. It’s capable of using AR-15 type magazines that are widely available in a range of capacities.

Sig is, of course, a top of the line manufacturer, and this weapon shows beautifully.

No bayonet or mount on this one and the stock was filled (at the factory) where it should inlet into it. 
Has an aftermarket recoil pad, interior shock absorbing buffer, and a muzzle brake. Other than that this one is all original. Matching numbers, Chi Com canvas sling and shoots perfectly. I know because I have fired it back when I originally bought it. 
I will include with it one LN original equipment 30 rd. steel mag, two new Tapco 20 rd. ones, and one new 5 rd removable Tapco one. 
I will also include over 400 rounds of Tula 7.62x39 ammo of recent manufacture and a few odds and ends stripper clips. 
This is as nice of a Chinese SKS that is out there and will make anybody tickled to get it. 
I will meet FTF within 20 miles of zip 43518. Please bring valid Ohio ID. CCW permit holders go to the head of the line.  Firm on price but willing to negotiate fair trades. The operative word here is fair."

Defense revolver, offers great concealability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire."

For that reason it was originally named ""Полуавтоматическая винтовка Драгунова"" Dragunov's Semi-automatic Rifle.

Operating mechanism

The Dragunov is a semi-automatic gas-operated rifle with a short-stroke gas-piston system. The barrel breech is locked through a rotating bolt (left rotation) and uses three locking lugs to engage corresponding locking recesses in the barrel extension. The rifle has a manual, two-position gas regulator.

After discharging the last cartridge from the magazine, the bolt carrier and bolt are held back on a bolt catch that is released by pulling the cocking handle to the rear. The rifle has a hammer-type striking mechanism and a manual lever safety selector. The firing pin is a ""free floating"" type, and as a result, some soft primered ammunition had the reputation of causing a ""slam fire"" event. Thus, military grade ammunition with primers confirmed to be properly seated is recommended for the Dragunov and its variants. This appears to have solved the ""slam fire"" issue. The rifle's receiver is machined to provide additional accuracy and torsional strength. The Dragunov's receiver bears a number of similarities to the AK action, such as the large dust cover, iron sights and lever safety selector, but these similarities are primarily cosmetic in nature.

Barrel

The barrel profile is relatively thin to save weight and is ended with a slotted flash suppressor. The barrel’s bore is chrome-lined[3] for increased corrosion resistance, and features 4 right-hand grooves. It is not rifled over its full length but partly over a length of 547 mm (21.5 in). In the 1960s the twist rate was 320 mm (1:12.6 in). During the 1970s the twist rate was tightened to 240 mm (1:9.4 in) which reduced the accuracy of fire with sniper cartridges by 19%. This adaptation was done in order to facilitate the use of tracer and armor-piercing incendiary ammunition, since these bullet types required a shorter twist rate for adequate stabilization.

The rifle can also fire standard 7.62×54mmR ammunition with either conventional, tracer or armor piercing incendiary rounds."

It is the most accurate .308 AR I've ever had the pleasure to fire. Barrel is stainless, 24"", fluted for rigidity. It has an incredible Leica scope on it. The scope is 4.5-14x42. In my opinion, it is brighter and crisper than many optically similar Leo's or NF. It has a very nice Magpul PRS stock that is completely adjustable to your shoulder and cheek weld. Also included are two 20rd Magpul PMags, a good bipod, and a rifle case that fits just right.

Very low rounds on this gun, probably less than 100rds shot. It is very clean. I'm planning a move in the future, and this one isn't coming with me.

Edit | Favorite 700.00 OBO Compact model light weight Springfield Armory 1911. These were made for a short time in the early 1990's. They had an officers model size frame and a 4"" barrell. They were extremely handy and concealable while offering a decent length sight radius and reliability. This one has the match grade bushingless barrel and 1 peice guide rod, beavertail grip safety with speed bump, long trigger, novak style sights, and walnut grips.

Comes with brand new, never used Black Dog Machine 50 round drum magazine (these are going for $150-$250 each on Gunbroker), original 10 round Sig/BDM mag and a 30 round PMag. The smaller magazines have been used and no problems. 

The Sig has an AIM 4x tactical dot scope mounted and zeroed for 25 yards. Also included and installed on the rifle is a short bipod, adjustable angle forward pistol grip and Voodoo Tactical single point bungee sling. 

This package is awesome and runs perfectly. A brick or so of ammo (runs subsonic reliably and is stupid quiet) only has been run through this beauty.  

This package comes with 3 bricks of .22lr high velocity ammo so you can immediately hit the range and have a blast. 

This is an awesome rifle to teach kids on. The bipod takes most of the weight and the scope makes it easy to drill bullets through 1 ragged hole (with ammo asst'd by weight). 

This is the most reliable .22 semi auto that I've ever fired. Zero ftf's, no stove pipes or other ejection failures. The magazines all have had zero feeding probs (the drum mag has not been loaded, only put into the rifle for the pics. 

I know what I have into this package and what the market is doing right now and for the immediate future. A rifle like this may not be available much longer. Don't waste my time or yours with lowball or jerkoff email, you won't like my response."

Also comes with a mag pouch that attaches to the butt stock. I will require a valid ID and bill of sale. Ohio CCW preferred. I am interested in the firearms below. Will trade for multiple firearms or straight if the value is the same. I have had a lot of offers and most have been silly. I will not respond if you offer me less than what I paid new. I will not trade my AR for your ruger 10/22 straight up either!!! Again if you send me a dumb offer I will not respond.
Will sell for $1350. The price is high due to the firearms I want being priced high. This is the price firm. That is also why I would rather trade."

Has the sling that it came with on it, an ammo pouch, 3 stripper clips, and the spike style bayonet that came with it, though it will not fit while the bipod is attached. The stock is in pretty good shape but does have some scuffs here and there and the spring in the floorplate broke, luckily I've sourced and ordered a new one. I have around 90 or so rounds to go with it, Soviet surplus stuff. I bought it in June and it still had cosmoline on it and have put MAYBE 200 rounds down it, it was super accurate with the iron sights but I never got the chance to sight in the scope. The action is super smooth. I cleaned it and put it up in July when I purchased my SKS and haven't fired it since.

Hi the other day I happened to get lucky and grab 2 Promags for the Ruger 10/22 at the local Bass Pro Shop that hold 32 rounds of .22 ammo for the rifle. My intentions were to use these at the range so i didn't have to spend 60% of my time reloading my Ruger.

(Unfortunately it takes 30 seconds to shoot 10 rounds and 2 mins to reload it, can be annoying at times.)

Its barrel is hammer forged into a one inch equilateral triangle, with its vertices truncated to form 0.410"" joining radii. Measuring at the radii, and Ignoring the flats, there is the same 0.820"" muzzle diameter found on other Remington models like the Sendero or VFS.

Triangular forms are great for stiffening spans and suppressing group dispersing vibration. Truncating the vertices of a triangle and joining the sides with arches further enhances stiffening compared to round, basic triangular or hexagonal forms. The unique shape of the VTR provides  16% greater surface area than a round barrel for improved cooling and the overall metal removal reduces barrel weight by roughly 8%.

""The new Model 700™ VTR™ desert RECON (in Digital Desert camo) features Remington's patent-pending triangular barrel contour that offers reduced weight over traditional heavy barrels, yet delivers optimum heat dissipation and rigidity.

Built on the famous Model 700™ cylindrical action, Remington® Varmint rifles are the most accurate factory-built models we produce. You'll be stunned by the degree of precision you get straight out of the box. The varmints won't be so lucky!""

Included is a Nikon Coyote special scope, rifle manual, case, bipod, and bipod mount, 2 sling swivels.
The rifle has around 200 rounds max fired through it.
The only flaw with this rifle is a paint scratch on the magazine floor plate. Most people would probably replace this part to adapt a removable mag anyhow. It is not a major deal.

Thanks for reading.


PS: I'm having difficulties posting pictures, but just send an email and I'll happily send you pictures of the rifle."

Fewer than 100 rounds thru it. No rust, blemishes or any other flaws. Will shoot .410 shotgun rounds or .45 Long Colt pistol rounds. This gun is devastating at close to medium range. Holds five rounds, but if you hit your target you won't need more than one. This gun will put a fully grown male grizzly bear on its back. It is no joke how powerful this gun is.
If you're looking for self-defense this is the gun for you; no safeties to deal with, no cocking, no chambering a round, no slide. Just point and fire. For that woman in you're life or if you are the fairer sex, this gun is perfect. No need to learn all the things an auto requires you to learn to fire. Under that moment of pressure, when you're under stress, you don't want to have to deal with everything that comes with firing an auto. You're under stress, you're protecting you or a loved one and you just want to pull that trigger and remove the treat. That is what this gun was made for. You don't want to deal with chambering a round, cocking the hammer, removing the safety and the finely firing the gun--that's what you'll have to deal with if you chose an auto. I'm not against autos, they have their place-I own several-but, for self defense under pressure a revolver cant be beat. If you need a gun that fires 21 rounds and can be reloaded fast, I can sell you an auto-just let me known I have one for sale (Springfield XD with four magazines).

MSRP $575.  You cannot get this item new anywhere for this (cash) price and many dealers and even distributors are currently OUT OF STOCK.

With the addition of the Px4 Compact in 2010, Beretta completed the Px4 family of pistols. Heralded by many as the ultimate in balance, feel and proportion, the Compact is well suited for concealed carry yet perfectly at home in a duty holster. Its compact and controllable design accommodates plainclothes operations, home defense, or a day at the range. 

Unlike other ""compact"" pistols, the Px4 Compact offers a full grip for most shooters, providing incredible controllability in an easy to carry package. The 13 round capacity provides for true combat effectiveness, while still remaining compact. Equipped with an accessory rail, new ambidextrous slide stop and new integral/retractable lanyard loop, the Px4 Compact is highly flexible and mission ready. 

With a cold hammer forged barrel, for precision and the Px4 family’s rotary barrel system to reduce recoil for faster follow up shots, the Compact is fast and accurate. Technology, precision, and a smaller profile make the Px4 Compact the ultimate in concealable, duty ready pistols. The compact models accept the full size magazines, as well increasing capacity 14 or 17 rounds.

These are Lake City brass cases in 7.62 x 51 or more commonly called .308 winchester.  Each piece has been de-capped, cleaned and polished using stainless steel pins.
  I ran each case thru the RCBS primer pocket uniforming tool head.   They fit on easily which indicates the crimp had been removed or was minimal.   My source says these are once fired from a CA. military range.
All further case prep is up to the buyer.  
Any questions please write me thru Armslist.

I had the question whether these were LR cases (match grade).  They are not.  They have the standard LC marking with the date and the nato cross.
