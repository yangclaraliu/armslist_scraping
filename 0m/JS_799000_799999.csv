These are currently being sold for over $1000 on Armslist and gunbroker. I bought this rifle and have since decided that I do not need another AK. There is nothing wrong with this rifle. I have cleaned the rifle with froglube and shot two boxes of fiocchi (40rds.) through it. This is not the best made rifle, nor is it the worst. The front site is not canted and the rivets are pretty good. If you have noticed, top end production AKs like arsenals are going for well over $1200 which is ridiculous! If you need a battle rifle before an AWB than look no further. It comes with two 30 round magazines and lifetime warranty paperwork that I have not filled out yet. I also have some 40 round magazines that I will sell or trade.

I have a NEW COLT Hbar II Match rifle in 223/556. It is a flat top with Wilson Combat rear sight and standard front sight. It has some minor wear from being in the safe, but other than that, it is great condition. It comes with sling, hard case, and 1 30rd mag. The ACOG is not included in the sale but is also available.

The ACOG is a TA11B 3.5x35 scope with red cevron. It was department issued but had the glass and internal parts replaced by Trijicon in Oct. It has some minor cosmetic wear on the outside, but is clear, and outstanding scope. I am asking $700.

It's a Steyr M40. Not a super rare gun but not all that common either; I have only seen a handful of these. I have always thought very highly of Steyr; they are some great quality firearms. It handles very well and is a very innovative handgun, including features such as an exceptionally low bore axis, trapazoid sights and finger-tip safety. The trigger is incredibly smooth, something like 5.5lbs, as close to a 1911 trigger as any polymer pistol will get. It is a very solid gun and well engineered. The M40 was designed from the ground-up as a .40 handgun, the story goes that the designer, Wilhelm Bubits, originally worked for Glock and that this (the M40) was his view of the next generation of polymer pistols.

It has some honest holster wear, and is 100% reliable. I am the second owner and have put in the neighborhood of 500rds through it with zero malfunctions. Included is the original case with booklets and integrated key, plus two 10rd mags and two ban-era 12rd mags (not included if MA buyer).

I am looking to trade for a Glock 17 + cash (preferably a 2nd gen). I am open to other trades and cash offers. Extra's such as night sights and pre-ban mags will be taken into consideration. I'd prefer an FTF in NH (buyer must hold P&R and agree to a bill of sale), but would be willing to do an FFL transfer to a MA resident."

This Walther bears little resemblance to the legendary PP and PPK pistols. It is also well away from the size and weight ranges seen in the other eight guns. It differs in that it is the only pistol under consideration that has a form of DA/SA lockwork. This made the shooting exercises a good bit easier than with the other guns, although there were still a few malfunctions. We used the single-action aspect of the trigger system. The generous butt section and large adjustable sights made it even easier. This design actually began with the company’s inexpensive rimfire pistol, which has the same receiver shell. They put a different slide on top and added proper sights to produce a nice, medium-size .380 pistol. With modernistic styling, the PK380 is rakish-looking, and that alone will sell some guns. Don’t be confused by the Walther-like lever on the rear of the slide. It is nothing more than a safety block that pivots into the path of the hammer, preventing a strike on the firing pin. It is not the decocker mechanism we are used to seeing on Walthers"

Daniel Defense M4 free float rail 13.5"" special run (rainier arms special) The outer locking ring has stripped notches. I will get better photos of this. The metal is shiny where you use the special daniel defense installation tool. It does not affect the function of the rail but I have not painted over the shiny spots so you will be able to see them when I get better pictures up.

I have fired 90 rounds through this for function, it functioned well and shot accurately.  I can assure you, with the Larue barrel this is a shooter. The rifle is extremely lightweight at 8lbs 13oz with scope, no magazine. (that was with a larue LT139 scope mount, not the warne rings). 

Price is $2000 Cash. If you want just the upper, $1500. Lower is not for sale separately.

Rifle is 16.5"" barrel length.

Saigas are produced at the Izhmash factory in Russia, the same factory that produces the russian AKs. This Saiga was purchased in November 2012 from Dunhams (have reciepts) and has had about 200 rds put through it.

The rifle has been converted to a traditional AK set up, moving the trigger group forward, installing an upgraded fire control group from Tromix, KVAR buttstock and a pistol grip (all U.S. made for 922 compliance). Also installed a bullet guide to allow the rifle to accept standard AK magazines. 

Rifle includes the factory 10 rd magazine, another factory 5 rd. mag, and 3 Tapco 30 rd smoothside polymer AK mags. Also have the original buttstock and trigger group, if for some crazy reason you get the notion to convert it back. 

Feel free to ask if you have any questions, I'm looking to get a Romanian PSL in trade, or $1000 firm + shipping/FFL if you're not in state and meeting face to face. I much prefer to just meet face to face"

I have slightly over $8700 invested in these lots, that is how much I paid to buy the property and the old house that was on it, demolish the house then remove the debris. I am asking $2300 CASH, or partial cash and barter combo equal to $2300, or a barter of one or more items equal to $2300 in value. ***My definition of barter item value is stuff that I could sell and walk away with $2300 CASH.*** That means no junk."

The AR's range from Spike's Tactical, US Tactical, Bushmaster, to DPMS. All with collapsible stocks, one with slide fire, all have Magpul read and front sights, and most have aim points, as well. All have bipods and all are sighted in at 100 yards.

So, since I have no worries, I am thinking of maybe getting rid of one (or even two) in trade for something really nice and unique!

So, what do you have to trade for an AR-15 (with front hand grip and bipod, front/rear sights, and aim point) , 10 AR 30 round Mags, couple hundred rounds of ammo.

I like the PS90s, FN, Scars, Socom, Kriss Vector, AKs, nice sniper Rifles in .308, etc.

PM me some offers for trade!

Keep in mind, I am looking for ""trades"" NOT to sell them (as many people still PM for). If I needed money, I probably wouldn't have all of this stuff to begin with."

It is a PA-15 Multi, 16"" with a 1:7 twist barrel. It has an Eotech 552 holographic sight, with backup Troy flip-up iron sights. It also has a Troy drop-in battle rail. This rifle will also come with 5 30-round magazines (2 PMAGs with window, 2 USGI, plus the original PSA magazine), 100 rounds of .223 brass ammunition, and  Plano hard case. This rifle is absolutely spotless. I am the original owner (purchased about two months ago), and with the exception of the factory test fire, no rounds have ever been through this rifle, and none of the magazines have ever been used or even loaded. I do, however, plan on taking it to the range this weekend if the weather cooperates, so if you prefer a brand new rifle, please contact me before then. I am not one of those guys looking to profit from the possible upcoming ban, but I do have over $2,100 invested here (receipts in hand), and I would just as soon keep it than take a  big loss. However, I will offer a $200 discount to any current or former Law Enforcement or Military (must show proof of service at time of sale).

I will consider selling without the Eotech for $1,650.

MP5 SD
The MP5SD is the full-time suppressed variant of the MP5 submachine gun. This version uses an integral aluminum or optional wet-technology stainless steel sound suppressor. Due to its ported barrel, it does not require use of subsonic ammunition for effective sound reduction like most conventional sound suppressed submachine guns. The removable sound suppressor is integrated into the weapon’s design and conforms to the normal length and profile of a conventional, unsuppressed submachine.

The MP5SD is fully compatible with all existing MP5 accessories and trigger groups.

Features & System Characteristics:
Subsonic speed of the bullets is achieved via ports in the barrel reducing the gas pressure
Muzzle blast is reduced and flash is effectively eliminated by the suppressor
Highly reliable recoil-operated delayed blowback bolt system
Precision-made free-floating, cold hammer forged barrel delivers long barrel life (20,000+ rounds)
Fires from accurate closed-bolt position (upon cessation of firing, the bolt is closed)
Fixed, retractable, and folding buttstocks are interchangeable
Special attachment points for mounting optical sights or other aiming units with 100% return-to-zero
Interchangeable trigger groups
Extensive variety of HK and after market accessories"

A great feature of this weapon includes a safety lever so you can go combat loaded, condition 1 (for you former Marines), and not have to worry about ND's (negligent discharges).  In my opinion, I think it is perfect for a woman.

I will include 8 rounds of Remington Golden Saber 9mm+P.  Round matters for a carry too.

I will require a Bill of Sale signed, dated, and with a Drivers License Number stating you can legally purchase a firearm and I will not be responsible if you shoot up a mall/school/ temple.  We use guns to protect our loved ones not kill innocent people.  Be responsible.

Here's a more detailed info from www.beretta.com

BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT
The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is not only the best example of the semiautomatic sidearm concept, but it is also a perfect manifestation of advanced technology and aesthetics.
The Px4 Storm lines have been conceived to compliment the power, ease of handling, performance and reliability of the pistol matched with an original and sought-after design.
Manufactured in many calibers, the new Px4 Storm adopts the locked-breech locking system with a rotating barrel, which has been revised and considerably improved by Beretta.The overall dimensions are significantly reduced, considering its major firepower.
The light yet resistant pistol frame has been created applying the most modern thermoplastic technology, using reinforced fiberglass technopolymer.
Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts place the Px4 Storm among the leading pistols for personal defense as well as law-enforcement use.

LIGHTWEIGHT, ERGONOMIC, MODULAR

TECHNOPOLYMER FRAME.
The extensive use of reinforced fiberglass technopolymer has allowed the development of a light and technically advanced firearm with a modern line that is extremely attractive and ergonomic.
The technopolymer is also completely resistant to corrosion and guarantees color consistency for years to come. The rounded surfaces of the pistol are truly snag-free and facilitate the insertion and the extraction of the pistol from the holster. Also the trigger guard is rounded to ensure, when firing with two hands, the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard, underneath the barrel, a Picatinny rail (MIL Std 1913) is located. Integral to the frame, it allows the mounting of laser devices, flash lighters or other types of accessories.

ERGONOMIC AND MODULAR GRIP
The correct grip angle allows for instinctive aiming of the firearm, automatically providing the line of sight. The rear upper part of the grip is curved and slightly recessed to snugly accommodate and protect the shooter's hand. Both the front and the rear part of the grip boast a comfortable scaled surface that, not only has great aesthetic impact, but considerably improves grip, even in moist conditions. In addition, the pistol may be adapted for different hand sizes, even small hands, thanks to a new patented system that allows the interchangeability of the back-straps by thickness and configuration: in addition to the standard back-strap (medium), a slim back-strap is also available for small hands as well as an oversized one for large hands."

The Stock is polymer and has begun to wear down due to recoil, it is a $60 part. There is also some damage to the bluing on the top of the barrel from the previous owner. Other damage to the bluing is what I assume is normal wear. 

As these were going for around $1300 before the scare, and are now going for $2000+, I am going to ask for $1300. I have pictures on my phone, please text if you would like to see them.

AKs have been tested around the world and are known for their ruggedness and reliability. Unlike the AR15, the ruggedness of the AK47 and its forgiving gas operating system makes these guns less susceptible to jamming in non favorable conditions.  Ammo for this gun is more plentiful then the 5.56 and is cheaper because you can shoot steel cased rounds which a lot of ARs cannot do due to the fact of the steel expanding in the chamber. This gun comes with everything in the picture and I can send more pictures to your email or phone upon request.  I am available throughout the day so don’t hesitate to call or text me!

Had the rifle built for one purpose, to be ultra light weight.  the total gun weighs in at about 5.5lbs. This rife is something that is fun to shoot with the 2lbs trigger. You can rattle off rounds effortlessly and it does it ever so smoothly. I have maybe 120 rounds through it and it has been taken care of. I am selling because I just bought a PTR91.
I believe I am listing this at a fair price. I have seen standard carbon 15 busmasters listed for 1400-1800. This gun has about $500 of extras in it.

Thanks for looking. I have 5 guns I am looking to trade;

 #1: An EAA (European/American Arms) Windicator .357 magnum/.38 Special. It comes with the original box and papers, as well as a locally made under-the-shoulder/strong-side leather holster. It is an incredibly accurate gun, capable of hitting 4"" plates at 50 yards with ease. I have put about 150 rounds through this gun without one hiccup or malfunction. I paid $300 for the gun, and $100 for the holster rig. Price: $400
#2: A Savage Stevens model 62 .22lr semi-auto rifle with a Tasco scope and 3 magazines. It has had about 700 rounds passed through the gun, and only 5 jams in all that time(due to poorly made bullets). My price: $160
#3: A CVA (Connecticut Valley Arms) Plainshunter .50 caliber black-powder muzzle-loader. Hitting 4"" plates at 60 yards is not a problem with this gun. Price: $450
#4: SOLD
#5:SOLD
The reason I am putting these up is because there are certain guns that I have been trying to get for the past 5 years or so that I want to get now before ALL guns are banned. I am not interested in selling these guns except for the musket, the prices are for you to see what I spent on them and what I want to get in trade value for them. If this ad is still up, it means I still have them."
