That's one step from absolute perfection. The set has coins from 1986 through and including 2012. This set DOES include the KEY DATE 1996 coin, which had a mintage of roughly 3 million coins (compare that to the over 30 million produced in 2009 and 2010). This is a fantastic opportunity to purchase every single year of the US Mint's Silver Eagle program and have the quality assurance from one of one of the two most prestigious grading companies, the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation. They guaranty the authenticity of the coins as well as the quality of these coins. NGC (tracks auctions and selling prices of each coin) currently values the set I am offering at $1,566.90.

Please submit serious COLLECTOR offers only. I'm not hard up for cash, so don't low-ball me. I've already sold one set for my asking price just last week. This is not a scrap metal sale, nor should you expect to turn a quick profit by purchasing this set - this is not that kind of offering. 

It took me a long time and countless hours to put together this near-flawless (MS70 would be flawless) set of coins and I will not break it up as there is a great deal of added value in having the complete set over simply random years. Once you see this set, you will want it. Once you own this set, you will never let it go. It is a thing of beauty and the plastic cases mean they will stay that way. Protect yourself from the non-stop printing of the US dollar and the likely inflation that's well on it's way (look no further than Greece, my friends) - own precious metals such as this American Silver Eagle set.

Any sale will happen in a public location for cash. I am also open to alternative solutions, such as trades for proof silver eagles (2000 and earlier), PF70 NGC or PR70 PCGS slabbed silver eagles, gold, pre-65 (1964 or earlier) 90% US silver (scrap or junk silver), or ???.

I have a brand new (never installed or fired) chrome-moly Adams & Bennet 458 winchester magnum barrel for a large ring Mauser 98. It has been cut to 20"" and crowned by Brockman's Custom Gunsmithing out of Idaho. It has not been reamed (you will need to headspace it on your respective rifle). I also have a Mauser 98 magnum bolt with a checkered bolt handle that was properly centered by the same. I also have an RCBS FL Die set for the same caliber as well as about 200 458 caliber bullets (50 Barnes X bullets and the rest are Speer). I also have some 458 win mag ammo that I reloaded by trimming 458 Lott cases, which I will also throw in if you want them (along with the Lott cases). The reason I am letting all this go is the Mauser build is causing me to much of a hassle (I still need a lot of work done on a very fussy Mauser action and I'm not dealing with any more issues). The total cost of all these items new and seperately (plus all the gunsmithing costs I have already incurred for you) is over $400. I'd like to sell everything mentioned for $300 but if I don't have any serious replies I'll entertain offers for less. I can also mail everything to you (you don't need an FFL for parts and accessories), but I will require either a money order or wait till the check cleared before I mail it all. As with anything the buyer assumes all responsibility for any of the gun parts he/she is purchasing. I would check with a gunsmith to ensure that all of these parts will work with your respective rifle. If you want pictures I can email them to you as well."

Beretta Px4 Storm Type F Compact 9mm



The Beretta Px4 Storm is a semiautomatic pistol designed for concealed carry and personal defense. Borrowing features from predecessors like the Beretta M9 and Beretta 92 it is rapidly proving itself as a suitable option for law enforcement (both on and off duty) private security forces and responsible citizens. 

The Px4 Storm comes in subcompact compact and full frame versions. Checkered grips on all models provide a sure grip in less than optimal conditions and three backstraps (included with every pistol) can be swapped for comfort and fit. The design is based on that of the M9 and 92 and the Px4 Storm cannot be improperly assembled due to distinctive parts and one-way fit. 

An ambidextrious safety (thumb operated decocking lever) prevents unintentional discharge in the event the gun is dropped. High capacity double stack steel magazines provide enough firepower for self defense and law enforcement. A non-glare coating on the slide resists corrosion and stands up to the abuse expected in the line of duty.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

AR-536™ Prism Sight

“Bigger and badder” is the best way to describe the AR-536 which sets a new standard for tactical prism sight performance. Its 5x magnification makes it easier to find and engage targets out to 600 yards, while the larger 36mm objective delivers brighter, crisper images. Burris’ proven Ballistic/CQ™ lighted reticle is ideal for tactical operations or friendly competition. Shooters can choose the high contrast black reticle, or select red or green depending upon the situation. Five different illumination settings make it easy to match any light condition.

This ruggedly built optic will stand up to recoil, abuse and weather. Key features include multi-coated lenses, adjustable diopter, integrated lens covers and three Picatinny rail mounting points. Remove the bottom rail mount and it can be readily mounted to an AR carry handle. It is ready for the range right out of the box. One-Year Warranty. Battery type - CR2032.

The appearance of the Model 10 BA from Savage is as radical as the extreme accuracy it delivers. The BA’s modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods and more. The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series — built for pinpoint accuracy. The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like no Savage we’ve ever made. The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team. Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown. There is no need to lap the bolt, because the floating bolt head ensures both lugs have full bearing on the locking surface. And the headspace on every rifle is set at absolute minimum. Standard features in this series include an oversized bolt handle that permits rapid acquisition for follow-up shots. Our crisp, clean AccuTrigger ™ allows the user to easily adjust trigger pull weight from approximately 1.5 – 6 pounds."

It has never been fired. Hello and Thank you for checking out our listing. Up for auction is a brand new in box Barrett Model 95 .50 BMG with a 29"" barrel. Please check availability before bidding. The M95 is an improved version of the earlier Barrett M90. It is a bolt-action sniper rifle in a bullpup design. The major difference between the M95 and the M90 is that the pistol grip and trigger have been moved forward 1 inch (25 mm) for better magazine clearance. Also, the bolt handle has been redesigned and bent down and to the rear, the barrel chamber has been plated in chrome, and there are also some minor changes to the trigger and firing pin. The Model 95 may weigh in at a smaller class, but packed into its convenient bullpup design are the intense power of a magazine-fed weapon, the pinpoint accuracy of a bolt action rifle and the effortless functionality of a perfectly designed machine. This compact rifle offers the velocity and accuracy of a 29-inch barrel in a shortened overall length of just 45 inches. Adopted for military use, the Model 95 is made for those who refuse to sacrifice accuracy for power. Its buttplate, magazine well and trigger housing are unitized, helping to stiffen the steel lower receiver. the steel upper receiver is reinforced with an M1913 optics rail and supports the chrome-chambered, fluted barrel. the two can be assembled in less than 60 seconds without the use of tools. The bolt carrier itself is a study in innovation. Designed for speed, reliability and safety, it slides effortlessly on machined-smooth parallel rails, transporting a large bolt that locks into the barrel extension on three lugs. The firing pin is driven by dual firing pin springs designed for consistency and lightning-quick lock time. The only thing more impressive than the Model 95 rifle’s performance is the comfort with which it can be used. the ergonomically designed rifle rests on a lightweight front bipod and an optional adjustable rear monopod. this careful attention to usability allows the shooter to quickly and accurately fire five rounds,"
