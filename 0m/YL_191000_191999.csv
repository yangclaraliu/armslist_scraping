Custom features like high ride beavertail grip safety, extended thumb safety and Commander-style hammer are part of every Kimber pistol. All parts are made inside the Kimber factory, ensuring quality control. 

The Kimber Custom sets the performance standard for production 1911 pistols. 
Models are offered with a choice of fixed, adjustable or night sights, and in 
matte or polished finishes. Both carbon steel and stainless steel versions are available. Common features include the Kimber Firing Pin Safety™, designated by “II” in the model name, along with rounded and blended edges for comfortable carry. Barrels, barrel bushings, chambers and triggers are all machined to exacting match grade dimensions. Ejection ports are lowered and flared, and sights are mounted in dovetails machined into the slide. Chamberings include .45 ACP, 9mm, 10mm and 38 Super.

He fired 3 magazines through it with no issues. After I got it I took it to the range and fired another 3 magazines with no issues. So, less than 50 rounds down the pipe.

This pistol was manufactured in 1924. As was common with most of the nickel 1908 pistols, the nickel plating was not factory original, nor were the white grips it came with. I still have the original white Franzite grips, but replaced them with a new set of laser etched checkered walnut grips based on the original COLT pony style that look great. I have the original box as well. I am guessing the nickle plating is better than 97% -- only noticeable loss is on the side of the magazine itself. No other scratches or dings of note. Excellent overall condition.

Pistol is worth about 650, but I got a good deal on it and do not expect to get that much out of it in this economy. Grips cost me about 70. Trade value is 550, asking 450 CASH.

Although I could really use the cash, I'd prefer to trade this for something else. I am interested in .380 ACP right now, but not terribly fond of polymer or striker fired. I prefer aluminum alloy frames or steel. I like the SIG 230/232 and Bersa Thunder. Would especially be interested in a Thunder with satin nickel frame and slide. Will consider other interesting .380 pistols, including double stacks. Would also consider a Beretta Jetfire .25 as a partial trade, unless it is a nickel, INOX, or Italian 950B version."

Unlike the original PWS EBT, this unit is made from impact extruded 6061 aluminum in order to keep the cost down while keeping the quality high. The Enhanced Buffer Tube will resolve any carrier tilt symptoms exhibited by a short stroke piston AR and will reduce felt recoil.

The most notable features on this buffer tube include:

1. One piece construction eliminating the castle nut and ensuring that when installed, the buffer tube cannot become loose.
2. Attachment system automatically indexes the buffer tube perfectly straight.
3. The bottom of the interior buffer tube extends a lip into the receiver, supporting the bottom rear of the bolt carrier, reducing the carrier tilt present in some piston systems.
4. A dead blow buffer is securely installed in the rear of the buffer tube to reduce carrier speed by an average of 10%, and dramatically reduce felt recoil.
5. Two QD sling swivel attachments are machined into the front of the buffer tube allowing ambidextrous connection of your QD slings.
6. The buffer tube is fluted to allow debris to be pushed out of the way, and a drain hole has been placed in the bottom of the tube, allowing for draining of water when the rifle is parallel to the ground.

The PWS Enhanced Buffer Tube is made to accept Mil-Spec stocks.

Usage:

For use on Mil-Spec AR-15/M16 based lower receivers and/or weapons platforms.

The pistol comes with 2 10 round magazines. I also have 3 12 round magazines available, that I will sell with the pistol fro an extra $125. Also included are the original variant 1 trigger parts, the trigger conversion was done by an H&K certified armorer ($65 for parts)

This shotgun is so unique and will set you apart from any other tactical shotgun owner.

For your consideration is a Remington 870 shotgun, built to outlast, outperform, and out-shoot all others, and with style. This 870 fires 2 3/4"" as well as 3"" Magnum loads. It can also carry up to 6+1 3"" shells. The barrel is a heavy walled Remington Police barrel, and the metal trigger guard, as well as the changing out of MIM parts help make this the most robust and reliable 870 available. This is a very solid and attractive shotgun, the Punisher engraving is very unique and quite fitting. The pictures don't do it justice. No pun intended :) It is equipped with the following:

*Receiver shell ejection side is inscribed/engraved with ""The Punisher"" in text and the famous Punisher skull. 
Filled in with white and silver long lasting color. It's not hard to guess what this shotgun's name is!
* 18.5"" Remington 870 Police barrel with Improved Cylinder bore and adjustable rifle sights.
* Custom fitted and permanently attached steel heat shield
*Trijicon 3 dot night sights (still light up well)
*Military grade synthetic ribbed forearm
*Remington Mariner/High polished nickle/chrome action tube assembly and forearm nut
Remington Mariner/High polished nickle/chrome shell lifter.
*Chrome police bolt
*Milled police grade extractor from Remington (this shotgun contains zero MIM (Molded injected metal) parts unlike the 870 Express shotguns
*Cast metal military/police grade trigger guard/assembly
*Drilled and tapped receiver
*EGW (Evolution Gun Works) Picatinny tactical rail is solid and made in the USA
* Tasco Red Dot Scope in perfect working condition with batteries
*Upgraded anti-walk trigger assembly pins that won't bump loose from recoil
*2-shot Remington Mag Tube extension
*Factory Mag tube extension barrel clamp
*Wilson combat extra power magazine spring for improved reliability
*Wilson Combat High Visibility magazine follower improves feeding and makes it easier to see that the magazine is empty.
*SpeedFeed III Tactical Magazine pistol grip stock holds a total of 4 2/34"" shells (2 on each side of stock)
*Sling swivel studs installed in stock and barrel clamp
*Also includes a custom modular quick detachable stock that allows you to quickly go from a Hogue pistol grip only- to a pistol grip with a stock with a comfortable angle for optimal sighting ability without the use of any tools. Its a highly adaptable stock system that is ready for anything. Stock has a shorter length of pull and works great for those wearing body armor.
*Includes factory Iron Sights if you so prefer to install them again in the future.

Mechanically this shotgun is pristine, the bore is bright and shiny, there is zero rust, and this is the most reliable shotgun you can get with such unique and incredible craftsmanship.

This add is for a used firearm and as such there are no returns. This must ship to an FFl dealer unless you are local and can provide pickup. Please note that if you choose to do pickup I will still require that this shotgun be transferred at my dealer in Elizabethtown, PA at MY expense. I am only selling this shotgun out of my personal collection to free up some much needed cash. Thanks for looking and good luck!"

This is a Generation One Night Vision Scope with 4X Magnification.
Generation 1 Scopes rely HEAVILY on AMBIENT LIGHT(MOON STARS)

familiar with Generation 1 NVD - This will perform to expectations.

Scope comes with IR Illuminator. When Inside a totally dark house......with the IR on.......THIS SCOPE ROCKS

This Scope comes with the HARD CASE instead of the Soft Case. A $169 value on the ATN website. No kidding.

Scope uses 2 CR123A Batteries.   Two Rechargeable Batteries and a Charger are included.

I am the original owner. The IR Illuminator is a little loose on the mount. Does not effect performance or create noise. Otherwise Scope is at 100%.

ROMAINIAN CIVIL GUARD MILITARY AK RIFLES ARE THE MOST ORIGINAL ROMAINIAN
AK RIFLE VARIATION AVAILABLE TODAY. UNLIKE THE WASR-10 AK VARIATIONS
WHICH ARE BASICALLY BUILT FOR CIVILIAN EXPORT, THESE WERE RIFLES
ORIGINALLY DISIGNATED FOR THE MILITARY BUT DISASSEMBLED AND SOLD AS
PARTS TO THE U.S. WHEN THE ROMAINIANS ADOPTED THE 5.45 CALIBER. THE KITS
USED FOR THESE BUILDS HAVE VIRTUALLY NO WEAR AND REALLY NICE BORES.
THESE G CODE RIFLES ARE ASSEMBLED ON ORIGINAL HI-CAP U.S. MADE SEMI-AUTO
RECEIVERS MANUFACTURED BY NODAK. THESE RECEIVERS ARE ORIGINAL FACTORY
HI-CAPS AND HAVE THE DIMPLES FOR ADDED STRENGTH AND MAG SUPPORT ABOVE
THE MAG WELLS. THEY ARE MUCH LIKE THE SAR-1 VARIATIONS WHICH ARE NO
LONGER IMPORTABLE. EACH RIFLE FEATURES A TAPCO U.S. MADE G-2 TRIGGER
SET, THESE TRIGGER SETS HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
NODAKS RECOMMENDATIONS TO INSURE SURE FIRE, NO FAULT PERFORMANCE. ALSO
FEATURES A U.S MADE TAPCO GAS PISTON, AND U.S. MADE 45% COMPENSATOR.
THESE COMPENSATORS ARE ALSO MADE BY TAPCO AND ARE DESIGNED SO THAT THEY
CAN BE LOCKED INTO THE EFFECTIVE POSITION FOR EITHER THE RIGHT HANDED OR
LEFT HANDED SHOOTER. TO ME THESE ARE THE NICEST AND CLOSEST TO A TRUE
ORIGINAL ROMAINIAN AK-47 RIFLE AVAILABLE. EACH RIFLE IS EXPERTLY
ASSEMBLED AND QUALITY CHECKED TO INSURE PROPER MAG FIT, PERFECT SIGHT
RADIUS, ETC. THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN FEED AND FUNCTION TESTED. AS WITH
EVERYTHING WE SELL YOUR SATISFACTION IS GUARANTEED.
BY POPULAR DEMAND, THIS RIFLES INCORPORATES THE ORIGINAL VERTICAL
FOREGRIP. THESE RIFLES ARE WELL MATCHED, HISTORICALLY CORRECT, AND LOOK
GREAT. LEGALLY ACCEPTS ALL HI-CAP MAGS AND DRUMS REGARDLESS OF COUNTRY
OF ORIGIN."

H&R also produced a .32 model which, while based on webley practice, was not a counterpart of any webley and scott model. it was 'hammerless' ( i.e internal hammer)model with open topped slide and extended barrel, and a short grip safety at the rear of the butt. it also used a coil spring recoil spring above the bolt, instead of the webley v-spring system. this model appeared shortly befor the first world war, and continued to me made into the early 1920's. this one is clean as a whistle with minor original holster wear , no rust, no pitting. shine in bore strong rifleing. perfect grips 8+1 capacity."

This is beautiful Spanish FR 8 Large Ring mauser in 7.62 caliber. ( $450 )
Bolt and Rifle are matching numbers, 

The Parkerizing I would say is 95 % or better, looks beautiful.
The rifle bears the Spanish Crest and is marked "" La Coruna 1956 ""
Left side of receiver is marked FR8 - Serial Number
Right side of receiver is marked Cal. 7.62
Bolt is marked with matching rifle serial number.

Through out this rifle on metal parts as well as the stock or small arsenal/inspector marks.

The stock is beautiful, it does have small little dings, or marks through out but are what I call ""character/history marks""
and no way do they take away from the appearance of this rifle.

The barrel is Sharp, Shiny and Bright and appears unfired or if so, fired very very little I have not fired this weapon, its been a ""Safe Queen""

At the front sight area and just under is a tube (see pictures) which is basically a storage tube that often was used to carry some cleaning tools or what ever the soldier perhaps might want
to place in it. It is removable.

This rifle comes with the following:

1. Original Spanish Military Sling
2. Front sight adjustment tool
3. Well used Spanish Bayonet, the blade is well used, the scabbard appears new the handle of the bayonet does have a small piece missing (see pictures)

Please note that I am interested in Trading this Rifle ONLY
I really don't need to dispose of it. It happens to be one of the odd ball rifles that I have and it dosen't quite fit into my collection of what I primarily collect.

Here is some of the ones I would like to trade, but would consider others that would fall into the realm of British, US, Russian, French, Swiss.....

1. British No.1 MK 4 rifle
2. British SMLE MK III
3. German K98 Mauser
4. US Springfield 1903
5. Polish M44 carbine

Item/set-up was taken out of my Chevy Suburban. In Full working order with exception of a 12vdc neon tube inside the enclosure (can be replaced with ease and minimal cost). Also including remote Bass Boost module for the amp (lighted knob kind), - you will need a double mono 1/8 end cable to plug it in . As you see, there was no expense spared on this stereo (everything was purchased BRAND NEW), Amp was $800 shipped, Enclosure was $750+$150 shipping due to size/weight and capacitor was $200. So, not including all the terminals and wires, spare fuse and Bass Boost module This set-up was $1900. As you see from the pics, there are over $120 in wires and high end voltage distribution hardware. I ran this set-up via 0ga DC cables, second dedicated Optima Yellow Top Battery with upgraded to 130AMP Bosch alternator and Battery Isolator (none listed are included) as this is a power house and, obviously draws some juice. Capacitor helps big time, thus was added into the initial installation mix from the beginning and proved to be a huge value. Any questions, shoot me an email."

989,http://www.armslist.com/posts/191989,For Sale:  H&K P7M8 - Outstanding,"NW Columbus, Columbus, Ohio","$ 2,000","Listed On: Sunday, September 11, 2011",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Single Shot                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is the H&K P7M8 you have been wishing for.  All matched numbers, three H&K magazines, night sites and standard sites, original cleaning rod and brush-unused, OEM plastic box (not matching SN#), and owners manual.

For those who have never had the privilege to shoot a P7, it is unlike any other handgun ever made.  A squeeze of the grip cocks the gun, while releasing that squeeze de-cocks it as well.  When the slide locks open, the same squeeze releases the slide lock.  One button push allows field stripping that anyone could do in the dark.

The P7 format is no longer in production.  Quite honestly, few law enforcement agencies or militaries can afford to equip their troops with such a well engineered sidearm.  (If wrong please advise) this handgun is the only handgun produced with a gas recoil, retarded inertia bolt cycling system.  Simply put this pistol, like high powered rifles, is a gas operated, semi-auto.

Since investing in this piece, I have learned that the original P7 was called PSP (Polizei selbstladen Pistole) and had its magazine release on the bottom of the butt.

The P7M8 was made for the American market, in the 9x19mm, 8 round with an eight round magazine.  A later 9x19mm version, the P7M13 had a 13 round magazine.  The same format was also used in .40 cal S&W and 10 mm.  A stainless steel model was also produced for Americans, who are known worldwide to not properly maintaining their firearms.  The P7 has made it into several TV shows and movies, utilized when the shooter was a person of wealth or distinction.  

The P7 is an all steel handgun, rock-solid in the hand.  Utilizing the fore mentioned squeeze cock function, the trigger trips at approx 2 lb pull, too light for any other duty handgun that does not have the unique safety features.  Tipping the scales at 27.5 oz empty, follow up shots are incredibly quick and accurate.

For the 10% southpaw population or any serious handgunner that knows he must be able to effective use your weapon with either hand, the P7M8 is completely ambidextrous.  Every function in performed exactly the same by lefties and righties, including the dual sided Americanized magazine release.  This is the weapon that range instructors can only dream of for basic handgun training.

End of history lesson for today.  As mentioned above, this beauty comes with three OEM H&K blued steel, eight shot magazines, each showing minor bluing wear.  Most P7’s you see in the States have only one magazine.  

The night sites have died.  It would be my guess that H&K in Sterling, VA, would replace the night sites without charge.  When you are one of the five finest firearms manufactures in the world, you treat your customers very well.

This pistol is immaculate, only very minor holster wear on the sharp corners on the front of the slide.  No drop dings.  The grips are perfect, what a beautiful piece!

Round count, who cares?  European designed firearms originate where terrorism happens every day.  Their troops fire thousands of rounds yearly in training.  The average American design weapon would rattle into pieces in no time under those conditions. 
There are proofing stamps on the right side of the slide and frame are BWB 318.  This is the BMI or Federal Ministry of Interior symbol, the bird is the Bundesadler (Federal Eagle).  The German Govt. does their own proofing and therefore does not bear the staghorn proofmark on items for commercial consumption.   I am told that this pistol was used the Bundesgrenzschutz, roughly the equivlent of our Border Patrol.

Near the proofing, there is a place where the insignia of the Bundesgrenzschutzn was removed prior to entering the civilian market. 

Now down to nickels and dimes.  
The firm cash price is $2,000.  
I will try to reduce the sting.  I will take in trade:  a carry worthy P7M13, US face silver or hallmarked gold or silver at spot melt.

Face to face transaction in Columbus, Ohio, or shipped to your FFL on your dime.

Many thanks to everyone who sent me tidbits of info on the P7.  I learned a lot, hopefully others will learn, also.
