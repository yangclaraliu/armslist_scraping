It was made in 1951, based on the serial number.
The gun is in good shape, considering it's age. The stock is Black Walnut, very solid with no cracks or repairs.
The butt plate appears to be original and is undamaged.
My gunsmith estimated the barrel finish at ~80%, the receiver finish closer to 90%, and the overall gun about 85%.
Look around on other sites and compare the condition and price of this Model 24 against the others. You'll see that this is a really nice deal.
There is no real damage anywhere, just typical little dings and wear that you'd expect to see on a 50-yr old gun.
When I received it, the right chamber was unsafe to load, as it would often fire when closed.
I disassembled the action and discovered that the right side firing pin and sear were both very worn. It appears that the original owner liked shooting the modified side more than the full side! :)
I purchased and installed a new sear and right side firing pin. The gun now performs flawlessly and is once again safe to shoot.
This will make someone a fine bird gun.
I'm posting some photos, but please feel free to email me if you want to see anything specific.

I realized just how much this gun was worth (600-700 easily) when I realized that in the right pair of hands, this gun is accurate out to 595 yards!!!  The officially stated maximum effective range of the AK-47 platform is at 300 meters, which means that this gun is the rare 1% of AK's that are accurate waaaayyyy down range.  Of the ten or so AK's that I have had the pleasure of firing or seen fired by their owners, this AK has the longest accurate range of any of them.  I doubt more than 1% of AK's (7.62x39) are this accurate in the 500-600 yard range.  It pains me to part with this gun, and you will not be disappointed if you buy it.  I know Century Arms builds have some bad press, but this one is the best of the best in functionality.

It has had a mount upgrade, a GG&G quick-detachable throw-lever upgrade. Decide you don't want it for the moment to switch to a magnified scope? No problem, just throw the lever over, the Eotech pops off, when you want it back on just throw the lever back over it's that simple. It will even generally hold a zero to within .5 MOA or so, no need to rezero! This optic is in excellent condition, with only a pair of tiny silver nicks on the protective hood which seperate it from looking new.

If you are unfamiliar with this optic, it is a very sturdy, reliable, fast, and effective holographic red dot sight. It features a 1 MOA dot inside a 65 MOA circle, meaning the dot is one inch wide at 100 meters. It is adjustable for several brightness setttings. What's best about this optic that seperates it from Wal-Mart specials is that it is very sturdy. Eotech's are commonly purchased by servicemembers for use on their duty rifles overseas, because they are sturdy, reliable, and very fast on target. 350 and a pick-up in/near the Stillwater area please.

It is the heavy barrel version with a 20"" Barrel. It has 35 rounds fired, and proper barrel break in. It was cleaned after shooting from the breach to not damage the crown. 

It is equipped with a Trijicon Accupoint TR20-G illuminated reticle scope. It uses a combination of Tritium and fiber optics, so no need for batteries. The scope is mounted using a Wilson Combat 1 Piece mount, so you can dismount it without losing zero. It is currently zeroed at 100 yards using 149g Federal ammunition. It is wearing a lightweight Harris Bipod, Blackhawk Sling, Butler Creek Flip Up Caps and a Voodoo Tactical Cheek Rest/Ammo Holder. 

The rifle comes with the original hardcase, cheek welds, buffer pads and paperwork. 

As you can tell, I used all the best equipment when setting this up. It is guaranteed sub MOA from the factory, and it does this very well. The design creates little recoil, and the rifle handles very well with great balance. The glass is amazing, with great light gathering. I am not sure I want to get rid of this, but figured I would see what kind of trades and offers are out there. 

To give you an idea on what this would cost to build:
FNAR Heavy Barrel: $1,500 + Tax or FFL
Trijicon Accupoint TR20 3-9x40: $715
Harris Bipod: $100
Wilson Combat Mount: $90

This Sig Sauer P226 9mm pistol is like new in box and unfired. This is NOT
the P226 Navy. This Pistol was only available to Navy Seals through Sig
Sauer. According to Sig there were only around 300 of the guns available.
This is a true collector item. It has the correct box, all paper work and
comes with 4-magazines. Again, do not confuse this rare gun with the
P226 Navy.
Please note the Special Warfare Insignia (“SEAL Trident"") on the top of the
slide. It is a 9mm Special Configuration with Night Sights. Please email with
any questions. Thanks for looking !!!

UPDATE: I tried to make it clear in the description, but some of you just
can't resist. You can't compare this pistol to the P226 Navy. IT IS NOT THE
SAME THING. Yes you can buy a new P226 Navy for $1,050. IT IS NOT THE
SAME THING. There were only around 300 of these guns available per the
Manufacturers statement.

If you are not interested in buying or trading, there is no need to email.

Product Description:
This versatile Carbine has features that are unique to the AR-15 Type firearm… a carbine length barrel, full length handguards and the sight radius of the original rifle design.

To achieve this, the Dissipator’s Gas Block is located behind the front sight base, and under the full length handguards. This configuration offers improved heat dissipation, and therefore the model’s name.

•16” Heavy Profile Barrel is Chrome lined in both Bore and Chamber for excellent accuracy and long life. ChromeMoly Steel Barrel, and other exposed steel parts of the weapon are Manganese Phosphate finished to insure protection against corrosion or rust.

For the folks unfamiliar with a Cavalry Arms lower:

These receivers are injection molded from glass filled nylon 6, a polymer material very similar to that used by other firearms companies. Polymer offers unsurpassed corrosion resistance, finish durability. and is significantly lighter than aluminum based receivers.

They are molded in two halves and assembled using a linear vibration welding process. Linear vibration welding forms the two halves into one solid piece. Every contact surface between the two halves is bonded together with a weld that is even stronger than the parent material.

Injection molding allows for more cost effective and faster production of parts of consistent quality. Production cost savings are passed onto the consumer.

CAV-15 MKII Receiver Features:

    * A1 Length integral Stock (5/8"" shorter than A2) with sling loop. 13"" Length of Pull.
    * Ergonomically enhanced integral pistol grip
    * Wider magazine well capable of accepting .45 Greasegun magazines with caliber conversion upper receivers and magazine blocks.
    * Standard AR15 magazines can be used without modifications.
    * Receiver weight (complete) is 1 full pound lighter than complete aluminum receiver with A2 stock
    * Uses all standard mil-spec parts with the exception of the take down pins. The front pivot and rear pins are a Quick Take down style with Detents built into them, allowing for quick and easy removal of the pins while maintaining a positive lock."

Parkerizing

We will then remove the current finish and any contaminants, and prepare the surface using a grit blast method that allows for a stronger finish to be applied.

Excellent condition. 2 boxes of 550 quantity Federal Value-Pack rounds through it. Accurate and solid. Magazines are easy to load. The 3 extra mags are worth nearly $100, 2 have not been used... only loaded. Selling because since I got a sweet Mini-14 .223 Stainless All-Weather Rifle, I haven't had this little guy out of the cabinet.  

The GSG-5 is a semi-automatic rimfire rifle chambered for the .22 LR cartridge and is produced by German Sport Guns and distributed by American Tactical Imports (ATI). In many ways, the GSG-5 is an exact replica of the Heckler & Koch MP 5 sub-machinegun. Overall length is 33.5” and weighs 6.6 pounds. Barrel length is 16.25 inches including the faux suppressor which surpasses federal requirements, making it legal to own by anyone. Comes with the original 22 rd detachable box magazine that releases with an H&K style paddle magazine release, and 3 extra genuine ATI GSG-5 22 rd magazines exactly the same as the original... not the cheap ProMag knock-offs. The charging handle on the GSG-5 is located on the left side of the receiver and is non-reciprocating just like the H&K MP5 series. The GSG-5 also utilizes the H&K style drum sight, which can be adjusted for both windage and elevation. Included is a claw mount with Picatinny rail allowing just about any optic from a tactical or hunting scope to a close quarters battle optic like a red dot sight to be mounted on the receiver.

The MEPRO 21 provides instant, all-light aiming capability, without batteries. Designed through close collaboration with Israeli Special Forces, the MEPRO M21 is battle proven, simple to use accurately and totally reliable.

MEPRO 21 offers a large 30mm diameter lens which allows rapid target acquisition with both eyes open. This was the first reflex sight in the world designed for close quarter combat, and it can be ordered with optional reticles – dot, triangle, open-x and bullseye.

Illumination of the aiming point is achieved by a fiber optic collector system during the day, and by a miniature self-powered tritium light source at night. Transition between the two systems is instantaneous and automatic to assure good contrast between the aiming dot and the target area.

The MEPRO 21 reflex sight offers users the ability to acquire targets accurately at any range, in any situation, with both eyes open.

Original retail price $2800 bought on sale for $2174 and $2326 after taxes. Size 7 14k White Gold with a raised Trillion Cut( http://www.diamondsonweb.com/information/trillion-cut-diamonds.mhtml ) Center stone .4 Carats. Can you say big?
All stones are eye clean and I was unable to see inclusions with a 10X jewelers loop. Not a professional so I won't try and tell you the actual clarity measurements. Center stoned is complimented by 7 .085 carat (approx) diamonds in channel setting positioned with the corners up and down so they all touch corners in a a line. There is even a diamond under the main stone that increases the incredible fire the main stone already has. Ring comes with a Lifetime Rhodium plating and diamond warranty from Kay Jewelers. This is very useful being that a rhodium dip is around $30 right now and the average ring needs dipped every 6 months of wear to keep the luster. That alone saves you $60 a year that is $600 in ten years!!! This ring was a limited production ""showcase ring"" very few of these were made by Kay Jewelers, very hard to find another like it. Would hold onto it but my wife wants to take up shooting as a hobby so we are looking to get some start up cash to do so. If you want to see the ring we can meet at Kays in the mall or another similar safe place. More pics available.

Also I have a unique ""one of a kind"" lightly fished 9ft 5wt 7 piece Rain Forest travel rod with a custom carbon fiber foam core handle. I built an additional butt/handle section, then eliminated one of the lower sections resulting in a 7.5ft 3-4wt 5 piece rod. I built this for myself as a lark but have never cast it (and probably never will). I did send it to Colorado with a friend, who knows his stuff, he said 9ft 5wt configuration  performed extremely well up to 60 ft where it started to loose it. Included pictures of this rod.

I don't want to put out any cash on this deal. So if you have a $1000 gun we won't be able to deal.

Break action, single shot, single-action with exposed hammer. Beautiful gun, wood appears to be cherry, very nice shape.

I bought this from another member last year with the intention of hanging it on the wall, but my wife doesn't want it on the wall so it lives in the closet. This shotgun really needs to be on display in someone's home or cabin.

Shotgun is functional and in excellent overall condition. Has never been fired by me, but I did a function check and everything looks in order. Accepts 2 3/4"" shells. Will work with modern ammunition -- this is old, but not quite an antique.

There is a REALLY long barrel on the gun. I'm not sure what choke, if any. An EXTRA BARREL which is about 8"" shorter comes with it. I had intended on having the extra barrel shortened to 18.5"" but never got around to it. Extra barrel came with the gun and is a perfect match.

Other extras include a black elastic shell caddy for the stock (brand new and still in the sealed packaging) and several boxes of ammo. Ammo is 15 rounds of 00 buckshot (2 boxes of tactical low recoil, 1 box of Olin military) and 25 rounds of S&B rubber buckshot (better than rock salt).

I have over 200 invested in this, and the shotgun alone is worth more than that. Priced to sell quick at $140 CASH. FTF in greater Denver area. Will not ship. Would be willing to consider quality .38 special hollowpoints (Gold Dot or Golden Saber) or .380 Pow'R Ball as a partial trade. Also looking for a factory original LCP mag. Thanks."

I'm not 21, I'm only 20 and within 6 months of my date of birth, clean record, no crimes, felonies or anything like that.

By Missouri law it is not illegal to sell or trade a handgun to an individual between the ages of 18 and 21, you just can't buy from federal dealers until you're 21. If you don't believe me you can look it up.

The rifle was worth 15-2500.00 five years ago, but now the economy took a crap so who knows, just make an offer fro trade if you are interested. The rifle has some wierd writing on the barrel that could make it worth a lot more if if can be deciphered (historical?). I have tried to get it deciphered to no avail, it looks arabic, hindi or something like that.
This is NOT a reproduction. The rifle is over 5 feet long. it has wicker bands holding the barrel to the stock that is breaking and getting loose, over 200 years old! If you have any questions and want different pictures please let me know and have a pic and description of what you want to trade.

These guns were discontinued in the US then the designs were bought out by Benelli. This gun has had around 2 boxes of shells through it. It holds 9 2 3/4 shells and is designed to shoot high velocity rds. Also has a screw off tip for different chokes. The gun is very light and fun to shoot. I am just looking to sell or trade. I am picky about trade but make an offer.
