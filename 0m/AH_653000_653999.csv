7,http://www.armslist.com/posts/653007,For Sale:  Colt 1877 Lightning,"St Pete, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 850,"Listed On: Friday, November 9, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Colt 1877 Lightning .38 cal.  5 inch barrel.  Manufactured prior to Dec 31 1898.  Good condition.  Some finish remains but the weapon mostly has a nice patina indicative of its age.  No rust pitting.   All matching numbers and excellent working order. The actions of these weapons are quite intricate and it is rare to find a working example with such tight lock up.  The bore is dark but rifling is still quite strong.  The barrel has the correct two line, block letter address.  Its faint but if you squint real hard you can see it.  There are wrench marks on the top and bottom of the barrel so this may have been a replacement or at least some attempt at removal.  Its obvious from looking at the ejector that it has been in place for quite some time. Also noteworthy is the original bronze spring for the ejector.  The hard rubber grips are intact, worn smooth in places, but they fit well with no chips or cracks.

The Lightning was the first double action revolver Colt produced.  166,000 pieces were made from 1877 to 1910.  It is earning favor more and more with collectors due to its similarity in appearance to the Single Action Army and the distinctive bird’s head grip.  Billy the Kid had one of these Lightnings with him the night Pat Garret shot him down. John Wesley Hardin was known to carry the larger .41 cal version.  This is an excellent way to collect a genuine piece of old west history at a fraction of the cost of an original 1st generation Colt SAA or Winchester rifle.  $850

The first Onyx - as the name suggests - had completely black metalwork. The action is machined from a solid block of steel with no protrusions through the bottom of the action. The barrels hinge into the action on stub pins or trunnions in each side of the action wall, and lock up is achieved by a U-bolt protruding through the action face. These engage in corresponding holes in the breech face of the barrels. The action walls also have cut outs that the barrel fences engage with, thereby producing a very strong closure.

Woodwork is fairly plain yet functional with this gun. The wood has been treated to a thick gloss polyurethane type finish. The traditional-looking chequering is certainly machine cut but in spite of that the points and diamonds are very neatly cut. In fact they're extremely precise. The stock is finished with a black rubber recoil pad of about 3/4in thickness, which feels comfortable and does help soften the recoil when heavier cartridges are used in the gun."

Great gun and heluva buy. Gun runs near 380 new, scope 60, red dot 60 extra mag 15 and carrying case 25. Please call or text me at the number below.

The Safariland Model 6280 holster is the base model of Self Locking System (SLS™) series of holsters. It includes a unique rotating hood design. This holster also features a Universal Belt Loop that mounts on a 2"" or 2.25"" Duty Belt. With no snap, the Safariland 6280 holster’s SLS™ design allows for a smoother single-motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways. The hood can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. It is also far less likely to release accidentally than conventional thumb break snaps. The 6280 holster features a tensioning device, which, when firmly adjusted becomes a Level III Retention™ holster.

The Safariland Model 6280 holster is the base model of Self Locking System (SLS™) series of holsters. It includes a unique rotating hood design. This holster also features a Universal Belt Loop that mounts on a 2"" or 2.25"" Duty Belt. With no snap, the Safariland 6280 holster’s SLS™ design allows for a smoother single-motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways. The hood can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. It is also far less likely to release accidentally than conventional thumb break snaps. The 6280 holster features a tensioning device, which, when firmly adjusted becomes a Level III Retention™ holster.

This rifle is perfect for your young man who goes hunting with you and is ready to for his own rifle, the Henery US Survival .22lr is light weight, well balanced and safe to operate, the rear sight is an adjustable peep sight.

When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, waterproof stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival Rifle is ready for action.

I used this rifle a twice, each time the 8 rounds were within 1/4"" of each other. I am very pleased with the quality and accuracy of this rifle. The only reason I'm selling is I'm funding another project, right now I need the funds for my new project.

The course is instructed by seasoned firearms instructor, Roger Pettit.
Roger is fully licensed and fully insured (Lloyd's of London) and we hold the class on an actual gun range. He has a great sense of humor and has great stories being he's an ex-marine, bounty hunter, and has worked with multiple military contractors. The cost of the class is $85 a person OR $150 ($75 each) if you bring along a friend. This price is ALL INCLUSIVE meaning this price includes course work, red book, certificate, drinks and pizza for lunch, and Roger even supplies guns and ammo if you choose not to bring your own!!! No tricks or gimmicks here! If you don't have experience, no worries! Roger will get you up to pace during the class. If you've done any research on CCH you know $85 is CHEAP and alternatives NEVER include this much. The classes are small (10-20) and Roger has years of experience teaching them in multiple states.

No drop-off fee, ZERO out-of-pocket cost to you. You set the price, I get 5% when I get it sold. No gimmicks, if your gun is here past Nov 31st, your 5% rate still stands, for as long as it takes to sell. 



We don't ""fix"" your chosen price after you leave to increase profit. My goal is to ensure that your guns get sold as quickly and painlessly as possible.

No more meeting strangers in a parking lot! Have the peace of mind knowing that your gun was sold through a Licensed Firearms Dealer, ensuring that the buyer REALLY is legally allowed to own your weapon.

This is my little gun shop, and I'm out to change the game one gun at a time. The world is changing, but the way most gun shops operate still leaves alot to be desired. Outrageous pricing, impersonal ""service"", trade-in gouging, and more focus on selling what's on the shelf than finding the gun that will serve your needs. It's time for something new.

My wife and I have roughly only 20-30 rounds through this gun, and it was purchased around March 2012. The firearm and all the things that came with it are included, and in mint condition.

The reason I want to trade is I shot just as good with the 3.8"" at the range as I did with our current gun, and recently made the decision to carry concealed. The 4.5"" XDM is very carry-able, I use a FoXx IWB holster, but it's just a hair to big for my comfort level. I've never traded/bought a firearm outside of a gun shop, so we'll have to figure out how to go through a FFL. Contact me if you're interested!

The white inlay on the gun is plain old crayola white, so it's easy to remove with mild soap and water.

I have the firearm listed for sale/trade on my car club website as well, my user name is spooky_pitboss, hence the nametag in the photos. That can be seen here :http://www.ls1gto.com/forums/showthread.php?t=454008

(If I sold both the Type 53 and 91/30 I have 100 rounds of 174 grain Silver Bear FMJ ammo)

The Chinese Type 53 Carbine is a Warsaw pact M44 Mosin Nagant Clone. It's been sporterized and is rough on the outside (though nowhere near as bad as the ones people have been ordering from magazines lately), but it's internal parts are 100% (I replaced the seer spring) and the barrel is surprisingly clean for it's age. It mics around .3095 like some of the Finnish Mosins meant to shoot 54R rounds (not to be confused with the 53r Finnish models with a .3084 bore). The barrel is free-floated and the stock needs some finishing touches but is in perfect shape to pillar and glassbed so as to finalize it's sporting potential. 

The 91/30 Mosin Nagant is a 1939 Izhevsk rifle which was refurbished after WWII. Unfortunately it does not have the oiler kit or the bayonet but does have the cleaning rod. The Wood is stellar for a rifle of it's age, there is no rust -anywhere- on this gun, the trigger/sear is in perfect condition and the bolt, magazine/floorplate, and any other parts not connected to the barrel and reciever were all replaced and are in immaculate shape. The barrel seems to mic around .312 but I would suggest slugging it to get a more proper reading on both the lands and the grooves.

I have pictures of both so feel free to ask. If you would be interested in a glass/pillar bedding job on the Type 53 or for me to do so for one of your rifles you can inquire and I could try to set something up."

I am looking to trade or sell two very nice and hard to find S&W revolvers. 
I have a Smith and Wesson 317 AIRLITE 22LR with the 2” barrel for sell or trade. It holds 8 rounds and only weighs 10.8 oz. I have shot CCI .22LR and .22 shorts without any malfunctions. This model does not have the ugly hammer lock. The gun is like new with hardly any signs of wear.  Specs can be seen here: [url]http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product4_750001_750051_764924_-1_757768_757767_757751_ProductDisplayErrorView_Y[/url]





The second gun is a Smith and Wesson 65-3 with the desirable 3” barrel. This K frame is in very good condition. It locks up tight, has great timing, and is a sweet shooter. The Ahrends cocobolo boot grips are new and in perfect condition. The stainless steel finish is in good shape, with no major scratches or blemishes. 









I am mainly looking to trade at this point, but I will put a cash price of $475 for the 317, and $650 for the 65-3. 

The main trade that I’m looking for is for a quality 1911 with a 5” barrel. I am interested in Colt, Kimber, Ruger SR1911, Springfield, Dan Wesson, etc. I’m also wiling to add cash to make up for any trade differences. Other possible trades: AR-15, GEN4 Glock 9mm’s (all 9mm models), AK-47, reloading press. Feel free to make trade offers. The only things I am definitely not interested in are any .40 cal handguns, hunting riffles, or shotguns.

It is a self-loading double-action pistol offered in .45 ACP initially, and later in .40 S&W and .357 SIG. The Mauser M2 is dimensionally similar to the SIG P229 pistol, also manufactured by Sig Sauer. Unlike most SIGs, it utilizes a rotating barrel like a Beretta. It's also striker-fired, like a Glock pistol.
Mauser is a German arms manufacturer 
The M2 by Mauser could arguably be called ""the safest handgun on the market today"". Several safety features are integrated into the M2's design. The pistol features a loaded chamber indicator on top of the slide, which provides a visual indication that a round is present in the firing chamber. The pistol's magazine disconnect is designed to prevent the. pistol from being fired with the magazine removed from the pistol, even if a live round remains in the chamber. The pistol is equipped with an automatic firing pin safety that will not release the firing pin unless the trigger has been pulled. A disconnector prevents out of battery firing. The double-action only fire control system (in conjunction with the striker firing system) holds the striker at half cock which will not fire the cartridge should it be accidentally released. The manual external safety, located on the back of the slide, allows the owner to quickly observe if the handgun in is the safe mode while in the holster and can be quickly operated with the shooting hand.

The Glock 26, often referred to as the ""baby Glock,"" has created a true and practical auto pistol alternative to the standard five shot snub nose revolver. The ""safe action"" system consists of three (3) automatic independently operating mechanical safeties which are sequentially disengaged when pulling the trigger and which are automatically re-engaged when releasing the trigger. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds as standard and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain the worldwide distribution among security personnel and secret services.

1998 Stingray 220CX
350 MAGNUM 300 horse power
Bravo One outdrive
121 hours, that’s right 121 hours !!!!!!! Will go up, we still use it.
Marina kept inside ‘till I acquired it last year.
This boat is WAY above average in condition and way low hours, way low. 
I traded a $14,000.00 Harley for this boat last year and I have put about $3,000.00 in it to make it as near perfect as it can be. It runs PERFECT, has never had a hiccup, the trailer is in perfect running order with cleaned and adjusted brakes and a new coupler on front. 
The cuddy has a sink, single burner stove and porta potty. 
Impeller was new last August. 
Trailer tires new last August.
Chain, anchor, rode all new.
AM/FM CD new.
VHF ship to shore new.
Shakespeare 5225XT new.
Dual batteries, 1 is new and the other 2 years old The list goes on.

Rigged to fish off the swim platform, I didn’t allow fishing from inside the boat, I didn’t want it to smell or get bait dried up laying around, or hook rips in my interior. The interior doesn’t have a rip or anything wrong with it.
I had the camper top front windows replaced last fall and the rest of the windows are scheduled for replacement next week, if his schedule permits. I have the material here already.

This 22’ Stingray is small enough to tow to any lake, anywhere, yet big enough to take offshore, the best of both worlds. With the 300 hp Mercruiser it will hit 65 mph in near perfect conditions with 2 people and half tank of fuel, slight chop.

Comes with 2 stainless steel MERCRUISER  props, all safety gear and life jackets, title and such and it’s registered ‘till 2014.

How much am I asking.....$250,000.00, because I know you’ll want to talk me down on price, so let’s start there. I plan to end up with $14,000.00 in my pocket, a gun collection or a Harley.
 If your gun collection and/or Harley isn’t worth $14,000.00, you’ll need to add cash, to make up the difference. 


You will not find a nicer, cleaner low hour boat than this for the year. The boat looks near new, no rips, no tears, 121 hours, 350 magnum, bravo 1 drive, new $400.00 cover,  no oil leaks, oil and fluids changed.
I am anal with keeping this boat clean and perfect and maintained.

I replace parts because they ""might"" go bad, not because they are bad.
This boat is in tip top running condition at all times. 

Will also trade for Leer Jet, will need flying lessons."

I have a Glock 21 that was a police trade in, shows holster wear at muzzle, shoots like a dream, nice smooth trigger. Was reconditioned by Glock and resold via Cabelas. Only reason I'm selling it is because I bought a G21 Gen 4 and don't need two of these things.

Comes with one magazine.
I put Talon grips on it. Easy to remove, but great for better handling.

Shoots great, no problems at all. Here's a video I made featuring this pistol. Copy and paste this link into your web browser window. It is the Glock I'm most accurate with.

nickle plated snubby in .38+P for sale. NO lock.

Beautiful nickle plated double action pistol rated for .38 +P ...nickel plated with wood factory grips, 
2"" snubby barrel. Gun # DBN6716.

Bought it new in 2011, and put maybe fired 50-100 rounds (regular .38 range ammo, not +P) through it. Very accurate for a snubby; recoil is not an issue at all, unlike .357 version. Classic re-make of famed “lemon-squeezer” model. Fire .38, and rated for +P ammo.

Famed S&W quality. Collectible...comes with factory S&W hard plastic case. Much sought after collector model that has NO internal lock (manufactured in 2007 prior to mandatory lock...making it more valuable to collectors). Wood grips have a few issues where I rubbed up agaiunst my workbench (see photo) but I was going to put Eagle black ebony secret service grips (eaglegrips.com) or Hogue ultra compact rubber grips on it anyway... and will if it doesn't sell for my asking price of $550 firm (plus $20 transfer fee for $570 total).

She's a beauty. Great for CC use. Safety is in the squeeze grip (“lemon squeezer”).

Hard to find model ...now cost $750-$789, if you can even find one.

In great condition. Prefer local pick up in Huntsville/Decatur/Muscle Shoals...even Birmingham as I travel there often to the VA.

Remington model 742 Woodsmaster in .243. It has factory engraving of a deer jumping on the right side of the receiver and a bear walking on the left side. Bore is in good cndition and blueing is still in very good condition. The stock has some light scratches on it from being used as a hunting gun. Has sling swivels on front and back.

The scope is a Bushnell Sportview 3-9x40; it is not much but will do the job until you get something else on it. It has some sort of distortion visible when you look through it but shots can be made easily looking through it.

Gun has been very accurate and has killed many deer and an antelope. I got this gun in 1977 and has served me well starting out as well as many youth.

$375. I would be interested in trades for 25 wssm and possibly Savage bolt action with floorplate non magnum models.

It is made of steel and wood-no alloy or polymer.Very similar feel and looks of a PPK or Makarov.

Single and double action with decocker/safety.Small enough for a ccw.

I think it is in 90% condition due to some small and light scratches on the front of the slide and trigger guard.

Has not been fired much and the bore is excellent with sharp rifiling.

Comes with Tagua I.W.B. holster and 25 rounds ammo.



I will consider firearms trades.



My pistol was imported by RSA Enterprises:

The Model 383DA was the double-action replacement for the single-action Model 383, retaining the latter's 'combat' trigger guard (providing a forward finger rest), and the swing-down disassembly lever on the right side of the frame, but adopting a new tang trigger and a different disconnector bar. The earlier trigger safety was discarded, and the magazine catch moved to the vacated location. The magazine disconnect safety remains, and the slide-mounted hammer safety of the second-generation pistols is reinstated. Some Model 383DA pistols are rollmarked ""Model 383-A"", and this phenomenon seems restricted to units imported to the U.S. by RSA Enterprises, who would later become the main US importer for all Bersa products. However, at the time, the main importer was K-MAX International. The Model 383DA was in production from 1986 to 1988, after which Bersa's fifth generation of pistols was launched and the Model 83 claimed its place as Bersa's current production, single-stack .380 ACP pistol.
