I have fired approximately 20 rounds through the gun and that is it. It is in great condition. It comes as pictured with the paperwork. Also included are two extra 30 round magazines. This makes a total of (4) thirty round magazines. I paid over $30 each for the magazines. I am asking $650 cash for the entire package or $750 trade value. I am somewhat negotiable for a cash sale. 30 rounds of 22 magnum is really hard to beat. I prefer a face to face deal  but I will consider shipping at the buyer's expense. I will also consider trades. In terms of trades, I am looking for AR's, smith and wesson revolvers, colt revolvers, or revolvers from the taurus raging bull series. I will consider other pistols or rifles that aren't mentioned. Heck, if it's not listed, offer it up anyway. I will consider all trades but I prefer a cash deal.  Thanks for looking.

This is a great shotgun for home defense or just for fun! Beware of the flashlight. The LED lights will blind you. When pointing the shotgun at an intruder it will temporarly blind them and they cannot see the shotgun pointed at their face before you pull the trigger ;) Call me with any more specifics and/or questions!

Furthermore it's not an original Sistema, since he's had it worked over at a gunsmith. So it's not a collector, it's a shooter. So even as a Sistema that's worth maybe $500 these days, it's lost value due to not being original. It's a shame people throw Colt around with these, hoping the get a sucker."

I have been studying since yesterday so now I am an expert on the 1903, at least I believe no one has all the answers when it come to these rifles. I appreciate any input you may have in regard to this particular rifle.

This is what I know about it, starting with the wood, very quality walnut, no sign of sanding or refinishing, no markings of any kind on the outside, ''c'' type 8 stock, finished in varnish or similar hard finish. 
 The serial number shows it made in 1930. It has a star target barrel made in 1925 with the flaming ordnance, shinny rifling. I am not sure of the barrel finish, but the action is parkerized, the sight is blued, ladder type with peephole, triangle, and micro windage adjustment, also is a flat blade when folded down.
The butt plat is smooth and has a clean kit in it. The trigger is serrated longitudinally and crosshatched at the tip.
It is all very smooth and shoots wonderfully.
My first guess as to what it is, is 100% original rifle made for the commercial market. Second guess is a very fine counterfit / made up rifle. Third guess is your choice. 
Anyway this is a fine rifle and at this time I will sell it for no less than $2,000. Trades considered, big bore short barrel revolvers, or other stuff."

The kicker on this gun is that it was one of a dozen or so brougt in at Old English gun shop with what appear to be new, unfired barrels. The barrel crown is unmarked bluing, not the shiny ring you see on fired or arsenally refinished barrels. I have not fired this gun at all, unfortunately I've only had it a few months and its sat in the safe.  I had originally bought it to put that unused barrel in a new ATI stock, but money is needed so my loss is your gain. Paid $135 plus tax ""new""."

The MISR S/A rifle was imported in 1999 without triggers,sears,pistol grips,or hammers. US parts were added to comply with United States Code Title 18,Chapter 44,Section 922,Paragraph (r). This is the only difference between the MISR and the ARM imported by Intrac. Some say that the finish on the bolt and bolt carriers were harsh straight from the factory in which I agree. I took the liberty to hand polish the bolt and bolt carrier as you can see in the pictures (can send pictures of before per request) and is much smoother now. This rifle is in great shape and is a great shooter. Unsure of an exact round count, but the bore/rifling is still in excellent condition. All numbers match and has the original Egyptian furniture. Im really looking to trade for a decent AR, but all offers will be considered."

One of such designs, is undoubtfully a Mauser model 1898 rifle, also known as Gew. 98 or simply G98 (G = Gewehr, rifle in German). This rifle was designed from the experience, gained on previous Mauser designs, and was first appeared in 1898 as a standard German army infantry rifle. It was carried by Germans through the First World war, along with carbine shortened version, known as K98 (or Kar-98, from Karbiner = carbine). In the 1904 Germans were first to introduce the new, ""spitzer"" bullet (with pointed tip, instead of the older blunt, round-shaped tip). New bullet had much better long-range ballistic, so all sights were regraduated for new ammunition.
Many versions of this design also were licensed to other countries, which also used to build their own versions of the G98. Most famous of those ""foreign Mausers"" are Persian Mausers, Turkish Mausers, Czech VZ-24 Mausers, Yugoslavian Mausers and some others. The list of the vast variety of the Mauser-type versions could easily cover a number of pages, but, for the sake of compactness, I will describe only the basic, German model.
The model 98 rifle is a manually operated, magazine fed, bolt action rifle. The magazine and the bolt action are the two most famous features of the model 98. Magazine is a two-row, integral box, with quickly detachable floorplate. Magazine could be topped either with single rounds, by pushing rounds into the receiver top opening, or via the stripper clips. Each clip can hold 5 rounds, enough to fill the magazine, and is inserted into the clip guides, machined into the rear receiver bridge. After the loading, empty clip is ejected automatically when bolt is closed. Magazine could be unloaded by operating the bolt (safety must be in the middle position!) or by removing the magazine floorplate (not recommended).
Mauser bolt is a simple, extremely strong and well thought out design. The bolt has three locking lugs, two at the bolt head and one at the rear part of the bolt. The bolt handle is rigidly attached to the bolt body. On the original Gew 98 rifles it was straight and located horizontally when bolt was in the closed position. On the K98k the bolt handle was bent down, which allowed for more comfortable carrying and bolt operations. Bolt has a gas vent holes that are designed to move the hot gases away from the shooters face and into the magazine opening in the case of the cartridge case or primer rupture. Next famous feature of the model 98 bolt is a ""controlled feed"" extractor. Massive, non-rotating claw extractor was designed to engage the cartridge rim as soon as cartridge left the magazine, and held the cartridge case firmly until it was ejected by the ejector, fixed inside the receiver. Combined with a slight bolt retraction at the last stage of the bolt turn-open rotation, caused by the cammed surface on the rear receiver bridge, this resulted in very positive primary extraction. Model 98 is a striker-fired weapon. Striker is cocked when bolt is rotated to open, allowing for smoother forward bolt pull. The rear part of the striker is protruded from within the bolt, so state of the action (cocked or not) can be checked visually or even manually. The bolt group can be easily removed from the receiver simply by pulling out the bolt stop, located at the left wall of the receiver, and then by rotating and pulling the bolt out. The safety switch is located at the rear of the bolt and has three positions: in the left position (when looking from behind the rifle) it locks the sear and also locks the bolt in place, so it could not be rotated and opened. in the middle (raised) position it still locks the sear, but bolt is unlocked and could be operated, to load and unload the rifle; and in the right position, the rifle is ready to fire. Safety could be easily operated by the right thumb finger.
Model 98 rifle featured a one-piece wooden stock with semi-pistol grip. Gew 98 and Kar 98K differ not only in the length of the barrel and the front part of the stock - they also have different sling mountings. While Gew 98 has two sling swivels, the K98k has only one, forward swivel. Instead of the rear swivel there's a through cut in the buttstock, through which the sling is passed. Those rifles also have different rear sights: Gew 98 have a curved, tangent sight, while K98k has more modern, leaf type rear sight. Front sights are of open, barleycorn type, on some carbines with removable semi-circular front sight hoods."

A very nice Savage 114 Classic model 17947, 24"" barrel in 300 Win Mag L/A mfg. in 2006.

Equiped with the adjustable acu-trigger, hinged floor-plate, 3+1 internal mag, dual-pillar bedded, fully floated barrel, walnut stock, monte carlo cheekpiece, hi-luster blued finish, nice wrap around checkering and excellent factory recoil pad. 

On top, a Burris FF-ll, 3.5x10 50 LRS (lighted reticle scope) model 200173 with adjustable paralax. Includes mounted bases and dovetail rings I believe with Burris scope-cover.

And for those of you that are unaware, Burris Optics has a lifetime warranty on their optics from defects in materials and workmanship no matter the original purchaser.

Rifle has minor handling marks but otherwise is in excellent condition and the scope is unmarked and in perfect condition. Although I do not know the round count I don't think this rig has been in the field much.

New premium leather-padded sling is included (but not pictured) and sorry, case not included.

Reasonably priced and reduced to $700.00.
I am an individual and not a dealer.

Will answer all inquiries promptly."

SO- If you have a slug barrel (smoothbore preferred over rifled) for a Winchester 12gauge 1300 or preferably a model 120 12gauge, i would like to purchase it from you or maybe work out a good trade. I have a nice older Marlin model 60 semi-auto .22lr that holds 17rds and is EXTREMELY accurate as it has good sights and a very thick heavy barrel.

564,http://www.armslist.com/posts/469564,For Sale/Trade:  1987 Chevy S10 reg cab 4 speed manual,"Havelock, Jacksonville, North Carolina","$ 2,000","Listed On: Friday, July 13, 2012",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Would like to trade my truck for a bunch of guns or just a few really good ones. I take an interest in AK's, m4's, m16's (ar's), stey aug's or similar, m1 garands, m1 carbines, FN FALs, etc. Pretty much assault style weapons. And I LOVE H&K's. I will pretty much take anything H&K. However I guess I'm kinda simple on those because I would much rather have the USP 45 over the HK45 but what I would like most is an HK USP .45c or compact. But I would pretty much take the compact in any caliber. When it comes to other pistols, I like military style or grade pistols such as Glocks, Beretta m9's 92fs 96, 1911's (bare bone 1911A1 style), etc. I also like snubbies sometimes but I lean more towards the ruger LCR style .357's or .38 spl. Just let me know what you've got and I'll let you know if I'm interested. Would also partially trade with cash if you don't have enough guns to reach this value. My truck runs great. It has 190,000 on the dash. Gets great gas mileage. It's the 2.5 4 cylinder, 4 speed manual, 2 wheel drive. Has new clutch, it shifts like a dream. Has all new sensors, brand new spark plugs, new wires, hasn't let me down. There is a little bit of surface rust here and there but nothing major. There is one dent on the left above the tail light. It now has a Chevy grill on it, not the GMC because it is a Chevy S10 but you can have the other grille too. I have since removed the rust and painted the tailgate since these pictures so it looks a lot better. That was 99 percent of body rust. Any questions, let me know.  

What I want most of all is a Colt Single Action Army style pistol. Just about any Ruger Vaquero or Beretta Stampede or similar will do. Just let me know. By the way, I don't like ruger redhawks, or black hawks they are ugly sporterized versions of the SAA."

Formerly the property of the Wyoming State Police (tag still on receiver), this shotgun has a +2 round magazine extension, Knoxx Spec Ops adjustable stock, Blued finish, walnut foregrip,  20 "" barrel with cylinder bore (can have choke added), and RIFLE style sights.  If you are un familiar with the Police line of shotguns, they are made stronger and to higher standards than the standard 870 line.  This is a MAGNUM receiver, so it accepts 2 3/4"" AND 3"" shells.  Also, note that it has typical storage/handling wear from being in a police cruiser and in a police armory, but it has been well taken care of, and fired very little.



From the Remington Website: 



Differences from the Express model:

""The Remington Police Magnum shotgun is built heavier to withstand the abuse and pounding that police departments inflict on their gear. It has a metal trigger assembly versus the Express's plastic assembly. The Police Magnum also has heavier springs (7 lb. sear disconnect spring versus's the Express's 5 lb. disconnect spring). The Police Magnum has a 22 inch magazine spring versus a 16 inch magazine spring in the Express. The Police gun comes with a heavier lifter spring. Each Police Magnum comes with front and rear sling swivel studs. These are just some of the differences in the two guns. Remember, you get exactly what you pay for. Both models function the same and digest the same ammo, so if you are inclined to inflict this type of punishment on your guns then consider a Police Magnum.""



I love this gun, but I need some quick money for moving expenses.  I also have a few shells, some remington 00 Buck and Winchester PDX 1 ammo if you have any interest in it.  Sorry for the poor picture...it's my old cell-phone.



The only thing I'd accept as trade at this point is partial toward a Kel-Tec PF9 or similar.



Let me know if there are any questions.  Thanks!"

Beautiful gun, jeweled bolt. Had the barrel threaded, and a compensator mounted. made a world of difference. Also had the trigger lightened, now its a hair trigger, with no creep. Nicest trigger I've ever felt
Right now its got a Redfield 3-9x50, (Pretty much a leupold vx1 i guess, since Leupold took over redfield) Bipods not included. Gun shoots under 1 moa with remington corelock ammo. Im sure with a good load it would do much better.
