Cash price with Nikon P-22 optic and mounts, $800. 

Got this to review in the summer. Reviewed it, bought an extra extended mag for it, cleaned it, put it away. Essentially the .22 Long Rifle version of the HK 416 carbine manufactured FOR Umarex, USA BY Carl Walther in Germany. Just got a new CMMG Evo .22 Conversion kit so I want to replace this one with another big boy AR. I've added some hard rubber rail covers as the quad rail can be abrasive, bought the extra magazine (30 rounder, the one that came with was a 20), and it's also wearing a Surefire G2 with a Mission First Tactical quick detach light mount I'll include in the trade.

Also for consideration I have a Nikon P-22 AR specific optic with rapid action turrets AND the proprietary Nikon P-22 raised AR scope mounts that go with it. Rock solid setup and outstanding accuracy during testing on this rifle. This addition to the package would remove the stipulation for cash added on my end in the trade. I'm flexible, but let's be reasonable. 

This rifle is ridiculously accurate at 50 yards and beyond and in 1300 rounds to date I've had ZERO failures related to the rifle. Only recalcitrant rounds via Federal bulk pack. Among a dozen brands of ammo run through the rifle has never failed. H&K style diopter battle sights are zeroed at 50 and cowitness perfectly with your optic. I ran a budget rate Sightmark red dot and they were perfect for each other.

Lots of pics and video shooting it on my full review here:

As an example, most of the guns we restore are over 100 years old! For the time being at least, pre-1899 guns are completely EXEMPT from all federal laws. 
We can offer Professional Results. Your family heirloom will look, ""Good as great Grandpa bought it!""
We are not a dealer and do not sell guns. However, we can restore your family treasure to its original out-of-the box appearance. Each project is priced based upon the level of complexity at the customer's request and the current condition of the piece. Most of our projects are old shotguns and rifles.

This is the bravest thing a person can do but it is not effective.  

To those who wish to ban firearms: This is the same thing as putting a larger no gun sign up on the school, this will not deter these people.  Banning firearms is a political move.  While arming people at schools will keep our children safe. 

Please also call your state legislators and request this type of bill from them. 



                      This is a picture of an Israeli teacher and her class."

The condition of the shotgun is superb. You could walk into Bass Pro and not know that this shotgun had been previously owned. It looks great and shoots great, but I need the money for school right now (so, no trades please).

Up for sale is my used, still functional EoTech sight:
-AA Battery model (supports Lithium and Alkaline) and they last well!
-Reticle: 65 MOA circle with 1 MOA aiming dot (if your not familiar it is perfectly suited  from CQB out to 100+)
-Includes rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-less mounting bolt
-Securely mounts to 1"" Picatinny (MIL-STD-1913) or Weaver rail quickly

This unit has been used plenty, by me, but is still in good condition. It turns on, adjusts brightness and shuts off as it should. Click sight adjust works fine as well. Was zeroed on an AR last. A few use and handling marks on the body and hood, but this sight has not been slammed around or marked up from abuse. I can attest to these being extremely rugged reliable and accurate. I can also confirm one complaint: the rubber ""battery grommet"" will fall out of the housing when changing batteries if your not careful and could be lost. I believe there is an upgrade kit available. Anyway, I am going a completely different direction with my rifles so this is for sale at a reasonable price for a used, working unit. Fresh batteries installed and pic shows the reticle turned on. Includes the owners manual. Retail is still $400 and up for new.

This is a real Eotech. Not a junk clone. Lowball and silly trade offers will be ignored. Looking to meet in the Lafayette area only FTF. I WILL NOT SHIP. If your a criminal or nutcase DON'T bother! Thanks!

This is a really nice shooting AR-15/M4 chambered in 5.56 and features a mid-length gas system which reduces wear on the gun and felt recoil. The 13"" inch Troy TRX modular rail provides long site radius and can be set up with different rail locations.  The barrel is chrome lined 1:9 twist and the bolt is also chrome, which is the best thing ever. It cycles so smooth and is very easy to clean. Just wipe it off! It has a crisp single-stage GI trigger and I topped it off with a Lucid HD-7 reddot for fast, two-eyes shooting.

A few scuff marks toward the bottom of the stock, and some light scratches on the left side of the receiver.
There WAS a LIGHT dusting of rust on top of a portion of the rib, from being in a lower grade gun safe that wasn't well-insulated. Some Breakfree CLP removed this easily last night. 

Also, to the know-it-alls that looked at it last night (I know you're reading this), there is zero rust on the inside of the gun. I inspected it thoroughly last night and today when it got light outside. Whoever looks at it next will also find the same thing. Both of you were completely full of crap (especially the ""not even worth $300"" comment). I also own 3 other 1100s and have taken them apart before to remove grime, so no, you don't have to have a gunsmith to disassemble an 1100. Has to be one of the most moronic things I've heard from someone that thinks they know so much about firearms. Both of you boys could definitely learn to show maybe just a LITTLE respect toward other people. Reminded me of that pawn shop TV show where those guys try to rip everyone off, and you two also looked like them."

Manual and Case included.

I bought this forteen years ago on my 21st birthday. It is 1 inch longer than the Glock 19 that I just purchased.  This gun is extremely reliable and there nothing is wrong with it.  It has never jammed on me except once when the brass casing on a range reload was bent. Even then it fired it just didn't eject.

When I purchased it used, the gun shop owner told me it probably had about 10,000 rounds through it.  I have probably put 1000 more through it since then.  There is a little bit of wear you can see on the slide from use.

The gun is a left handed variant which means that the safety and decocker was switched to the right side of the gun.  If you are right handed, an HK armorer can switch it back inexpensively.

The coolest thing about this gun is its ambidextrous magazine release.

Here is the wikipedia article on the gun: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_USP

I have attached a picture I took yesterday of the same gun new at Gander Mountain.  It has $1079 on the price tag. Add to that the $40 extra mag, $65 in taxes, $25 in high end  ammo that is included and $5 in low end target ammo, and this is a very good deal.

I have the manual and the HK plastic case the gun came in.

The price is firm.  The transaction will take place in the lobby of a bank."

First off, I have to mention this has been demilled and is not functional anymore by the welding of a steel bar in both the forward and rear tubes and the cutting of a hole in the right side of the rear tube. I do have the piece that was removed.

The trigger mechanism still functions, the sight glass is clean and the scale can be seen in it clearly. The rear locking bar at the end of the tube works and it comes with a shoulder strap.

I am looking to trade for this great man cave display. An AR would be great but will sell it and entertain offers. Also, just imagine the look on little Timmy's face when he opens this beautiful piece on Christmas morning. He will be the most popular kid on the block. The only downside is no one will want to play cowboys and Indians with him.

http://www.the-m-factor.com/html/specs_3.html

I purchased this gun new in 2008 from a dealer to use as my sidearm at a job as an armored car driver/guard.  It has a little bit of resulting holster wear.  I was only at the job for 6 months before I left for greener pastures (meaning Texas) and the gun has only been fired maybe twice in practice since then.  The gun is in good shape and has the vast majority of its life ahead of it.  The gun is not equipped with night sights.  I will consider any reasonable offer.

There will be no ammunition included with this listing.

Be aware, I am only interested in selling this weapon to a US Citizen or other person legally able to purchase firearms.  You must be 21 or of legal age to purchase and possess a handgun.  I am also not interested in selling this weapon to a criminal.  As such, be prepared to show identification at time of sale and know that I will require you to sign a form in which you acknowledge that you are a legally able to purchase and possess a firearm.  I'd rather keep it than sell it to a sketchy character and so I reserve the right to refuse to sell to anyone for any reason or no reason at all.

Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the threaded barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Outfitted with a true M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights.

The all-stainless construction of the P220® Elite Stainless provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long. As the next generation P220, the Elite builds on the exceptional reputation of out-of-the-box accuracy with the addition of SIG’s new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The SRT provides you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable short reset for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. No production pistol is more closely identified with superior performance than the P220 and the new P220 Elite offers shooters new features that enhance the pistol’s performance. These features include an ergonomic beavertail grip which allows you to obtain a confident grip from the holster even under stressful conditions. The beavertail also permits shooters to grip the pistol as high as possible without worrying about slide bite. Front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITE® Night Sights and custom wood grips complete the P220 Elite."

The barrel is machined from ordnance grade, chrome moly, high vanadium steel hardened to Rc 28-32. The barrel has 8 grooves, 1-15 right hand twist and features a SAAMI spec chamber which will allow the use of any SAAMI spec ammo. The barrel and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished for long lasting good looks and corrosion protection. The V50SS utilizes the time proven standard, '98 Mauser trigger system which has been modified for use in a Bullpup style rifle. This rifle also features a high efficiency shark fin muzzle break, machined from solid bar stock and threaded on to the muzzle of the barrel with 1-12 TPI threads. This muzzle break is designed to reduce felt recoil to that of a 12 ga. Shotgun. The muzzle break can be tuned to the barrel by altering the length via the long thread shank. This feature allows the operator to find the sweet spot for the break that gives the best accuracy. An M1913 Picatinny scope rail is attached via oversized grade 8 allen screws for easy mounting of optics. The oversized recoil shoulder distributes the recoil over a large surface area affording rock solid mounting to the stock. The bolt has three huge locking surfaces and a 60 degree throw. It features a primary extraction cam for positive extraction of the case. The receiver is machined from bar stock SAE 4150 steel and features pressure release vents for BOTH case separation and primer pierce, making this one of the strongest, safest actions available. We have tested these actions and bolts to pressures exceeding 100,000 psi with no evidence of failure. The stock is machined from aircraft aluminum bar stock. This Bullpup style aircraft aluminum tubular stock is made to machine tool tolerances and is completely impervious to climate and temperature. This Bullpup stock allows for a shorter overall length while still retaining a full 30 inch barrel. The pistol grip is a standard AR-15 type that allows the operator many aftermarket choices. The included M1913 Picatinny scope mount is a heavy duty design and allows for easy mounting of optics.

A heavy-duty bipod of the Parker-Hale design is also included in this package. This bipod is constructed of heavy duty STEEL, not aluminum, as are other bipods. This bipod will hold up to heavy duty use! It features spring loaded steel legs, which adjust for length, a baked on black enamel finish for long lasting corrosion protection, a rubber hand stop with mounting lug, a quick detach, spring loaded latch, it swivels 15 degrees, and it folds up for transport.
