The 22lr upper works great, but is picky with the ammo, i've found the CCI AR ammo stuff to be almost flawless.  The Slide Fire on the upper is way too much fun to be legal (and probably soon won't be ) the slide fire does take some practice to get the right amount of pull forward to function perfectly.  All around a great alternative to hard to find rifle calibers.  have extra butt stock, tube, springs and buffer

 to report that fits their agenda.

 On Sunday, 2 days after the CT shooting, a man went to a restaurant in San 
 Antonio to kill his X-girlfriend. After he shot her, most of the people in 
 the restaurant fled next door to a theater. The gunman followed them and 
 entered the theater so he could shoot more people. He started shooting and 
 people in the theater started running and screaming. It's like the Aurora, 
 CO theater story plus a restaurant! Now aren't you wondering why this 
 isn't a lead story in the national media along with the school shooting? 
 There was an off duty county deputy at the theater. SHE pulled out her gun 
 and shot the man 4 times before he had a chance to kill anyone. So since 
 this story makes the point that the best thing to stop a bad person with a 
 gun is a good person with a gun, the media is treating it like it never 
 happened. Only the local media covered it. The city is giving her a medal 
 next week. Just thought you'd like to know.

If you havent fired a pistol in the 45 GAP cartridge, you dont know what youre missing. This gun is extremely accurate. The lack of recoil is very suprising. The difference between my glock 19 (9mm) and this gun is almost unnoticeable. Dont believe the BS around the interwebz that this is a useless cartridge. Plenty of stopping power and ammo is fairly cheap ($19.95 for 50 rounds of WWB) and readily available through gun shows and internet sales."

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines."

It's been through all kinds of relability tests and passed with flying colors. It's very similiar to a Glock 19, but shoots straighter and softer, and has less moving parts inside. It has the quick action sight system on it which allows for quicker sight acqusition out of the holster. 

I have attached a pic of my first time shooting it at 10 yards. I've only been shooting off and on for 2 years. Mine has the Waffen Werks insignia which means it was one of the first very few models to hit the states. Waffen Werks is no longer involved with Caracal"

 Mossberg is joining industry heavyweights in the AR-15 market such as Remington, Ruger, and S&W.

Featuring A2 front and rear sights with a carry handle picatinny rail if you want to mount optics. Most tactical .22s have a 16 barrel, but Mossberg has decided to go with an 18 barrel for a better sight radius and a more traditional look.

These things have been selling on gunbroker all day long for anywhere between 3500-4500 without the expensive mil dot scope. I'd prefer a local buyer, but I'm only keeping this listing active for 5 days and then I'm moving it to gunbroker.com. So i suggest you hurry.

If you don't want the scope I'll give it to you for 3300.00, that should cover about what I paid and half of the taxes I got hosed on.

This isn't legally required in AZ, but I personally will require we meet at an FFL in Tucson and exchange bills of sale. A valid AZ drivers license will be needed as proof of Identity as well. Still it should take more than 10 minutes to make the exchange.

This rifle has the classic, squared off look that the newer Mini-14s lack. If you want to stay with a scope, the S&K mount the best money can buy.

If you want iron sights, a quality rear sights cost $40 to $70.

They have been removed from the plastic but have never been fired or loaded with ammo. 1 brand new still in the plastic and bubble wrap black GripPod GPS-02.  This is the military style with the metal inside the bipod legs to withhold more weight and abuse. 1 brand new in the wrapping Knights Armament Micro 600 rear flip sight that ranges from 200-600 meters. And 1 used Insight Technologies/EOTech M3X Tactical Illuminator with pressure switch and velcro to put it where you want it. It is lightly used and has some blemishes on the plastic and the pressure switch is brand new. The light is listed as a max output of 125+ lumens with an hour run time. I have run it for alot longer than 1 hour and it is water proof to 20 meters. I have money wrapped up in this so my price is firm at $500 but with the price of mags going above 25 for usgi and the rest of the gear here being 550 by itself no low balls. I accept paypal and will pay for the shipping so no one is traveling. Once the payment is received in paypal it will be shipped (just like ebay).  That way I know the money is good but if you don't ever get your stuff after 21 days you can retract the payment.  This is the way I need to do things because I am not located in PA anymore.   I will also accept trades on tactical shotguns that are lightly used or a good hand gun of similar price maybe even another decent rifle. I am open to most guns and if your looking to sell one and it is more than this and your looking for a good AR set up I can pay the difference. If you want to trade we will work out shipment and FFL stuff as I am located in NC.

This rifle has had the trigger group and pistol grip moved forward towards the traditional AK profile. The trigger group is a Tapco G2 polished and customized by Dinzag Arms. The pistol grip is Hogue. It has a chrome lined 16"" barrel. The rifle performs flawlessly with no FTE or FTFs. I am including 2 (4 are pictured, but only 2 are included, I can provide extra high capacity magazines for $65.00 each.) 24 round polymer high capacity magazines that have worked perfectly. The rifle includes everything you see: aluminum (US made) fore grip (with hollow compartment), bi pod, quick detach side picatinny scope rail with 4-16X Mil Dot Illuminated scope, Folding telescoping collapsible stock.

This is not an AR-15, this is a piston driven semi automatic shooting the larger .308 Winchester cartridge. This is a big rifle that is loud and throws a 2-3 foot fireball with each shot. You will get someone's attention quickly; I have had many people approach me at the range wanting to look this rifle over. the AK piston system is famous for it's reliability and ease of use, cleaning and repair. It drives a bullet that is up to 5 times heavier than the AR-15 and has up to 1500 more foot/pounds of energy with each shot. This is a big boy rifle, but the simplicity of the AK system is great for newer semi automatic rifle owners. This is a rare rifle, especially with the conversion already completed. 

I will meet FTF with TN residents, and I can work through an FFL to ship it anywhere in the country ( except CA, IL and other cities/states/etc... with laws preventing such a rifle. Know your laws.) 

I am not desperate to sell or needing cash now, I just do not shoot this rifle often and will use the funds to upgrade a long range bolt project I am working on. I feel bad this rifle is so under used, they are made to shoot. Please email me with any questions or offers."

After initial contact( via armslist) if their not willing to communicate via phone ...run . A scammer won't do this for fear you will ask him a simple question he can't answer. You will always get a vibe whether the seller is in the up and up, just by hearing them talk. 2. If the response you receive after initial contact says private owner...run. This is someone trying to protect their email address ,but not from spammers. Their  trying to keep their identity hidden from prosecution after they scam you. I find that honest sellers are open to all forms of communication and questions. There are alot of great sellers on here for sure. But when 800 dollar ARs start selling for 2000+ you can bet the number of scammers more then doubles as well.  Take care and best of luck to all!"

This rifle has had the trigger group and pistol grip moved forward towards the traditional AK profile. The trigger group is a Tapco G2 polished and customized by Dinzag Arms. The pistol grip is Hogue. It has a chrome lined 16"" barrel. The rifle performs flawlessly with no FTE or FTFs. I am including 2 24 round polymer high capacity magazines that have worked perfectly (4 are pictured, but only two are included, I have more that can be purchased along with the rifle.) The rifle includes everything you see: aluminum (US made) fore grip (with hollow compartment), bi pod, quick detach side picatinny scope rail with 4-16X Mil Dot Illuminated scope, Folding telescoping collapsible stock.

This is not an AR-15, this is a piston driven semi automatic shooting the larger .308 Winchester cartridge. This is a big rifle that is loud and throws a 2-3 foot fireball with each shot. You will get someone's attention quickly; I have had many people approach me at the range wanting to look this rifle over. the AK piston system is famous for it's reliability and ease of use, cleaning and repair. It drives a bullet that is up to 5 times heavier than the AR-15 and has up to 1500 more foot/pounds of energy with each shot. This is a big boy rifle, but the simplicity of the AK system is great for newer semi automatic rifle owners. This is a rare rifle, especially with the conversion already completed. 

I will meet FTF with TN residents, and I can work through an FFL to ship it anywhere in the country ( except CA, IL and other cities/states/etc... with laws preventing such a rifle. Know your laws.) 

I am not desperate to sell or needing cash now, I just do not shoot this rifle often and will use the funds to upgrade a long range bolt project I am working on. I feel bad this rifle is so under used, they are made to shoot. Please email me with any questions or offers."

In 1990, a good friend with an FFL was buying SKS's in case lots of 5 for less than $80 each, or individually at $87. At that time, AK's were going for $265 as well. I simply cannot get my head around the ""craze"" and the incredible markup on these weapons since then.
Now, the SKS is close to the price of an AK, instead of 1/3 the cost. All things considered,The AK was modified in 1990 to get around the California Assault Weapons Ban-hence MAK-90, or ""Modified AK 1990."" It is virtually identical to the AK-47 but costs only $200 to $300, compared with $1,000 to $3,000,,,,,,DO THE MATH"

889,http://www.armslist.com/posts/811889,For Sale:  YHM AR15 M4 With Magazines and Trijicon Acog With Docter Red Dot,"Canton, Ohio, United States","$ 3,200","Listed On: Monday, January 7, 2013",Rifles,Yankee Hill Machine                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Up for sale is my personal Yankee Hill Machine AR15. It is their Smooth Carbine model 8200. This is a complete high end factory rifle, not something put together in a basement. If you are looking for a top of the line rifle, this is it. One thing I love about this rifle is how comfortable it is in the hand, a lot of that is due to the handguard which allows you to have rails where you need them and no in places that interfere with your hand or rest. The 8200 also features their Black Diamond fluting which reduces weight, increases heat dissipation and looks awesome. It has an excellent trigger and is very accurate. I am able to consistently ring steel at 500+ yards with this rig. It only has 330 rounds of factory ammo fired, and was always properly cleaned and maintained. It is as close to new as you will find a rifle that has been shot.

I have added a few upgrades to make the rifle even better. I installed a Troy Battle Ax stock which gives a great cheek weld and also makes it more effective as a CQB rifle. I added a Ergo Grip which is a big comfort increase over the stock grip. The factory stock, grip and hardshell case are included as well. I am also including a windowed PMAG, along with 2 Colt magazines, one Bushmaster and one NHMTG

The optic is a Trijicon TA01NSN-DOC. It has been upgraded with a GG&G Accucam Mount with integral lense covers. The optic has an MSRP of $1,800, and the mount sells for $192. It comes complete with its Pelican case, all paperwork including decals, tools and Docter information. This is the best optic I have ever used on an AR and it is zeroed and ready to go. It allows you to make quick shots at 600 yards plus, and then use the Docter for close engagements. Another benefit of the YHM 8200 is the built in front and rear back up iron sights, so you will have three sighting options on this rifle

Please keep in mind this setup retailed for over $3,500 BEFORE the proposed ban. Don't waste your money on a Frankenstein build that you can't trust the quality of, with garbage Chinese optics and an unknown builder. Invest in a rifle that will only continue to go up in value and will give you years of trouble free shooting.

Any questions please ask. The price is FIRM. I will not take a penny less. Atlas Bipod and additional PMags shown in photos are not included in the sale.
