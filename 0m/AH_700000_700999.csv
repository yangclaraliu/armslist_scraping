Low profile, super light weight. Asking $100, these retail for well over that, plus you don't pay taxes buying it here! 

Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight for M4 carbines and M16A4 rifles flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights.

I have a Dan Wesson .357 Model 15-2 Pistol Pak and I am looking to add some additional barrel sets to it.  Mainly looking for the 10, 12, and 15"" barrels as i have everything else.  I would be interested in a 6"" barrel to replace mine as it shows some wear on it.  I would also be interested in the belt buckle that was original sold with this package to make my set complete.

I am willing to drive a short distance (hour or so) for the right deal, but if you are willing to ship that would be much better.  The prices I am willing to pay are dependent upon the condition of the barrel and the shroud.  

Please reply to this message if you have any of these items and we can go from there.

Salomon 165cm Scrambler 700: 
These skis were used when I bought them from a local shop, but they are in great condition. Since buying the skis I have had them inspected and smoothed by REI, but have only used them once on a practice run. The Salomon 5710 bindings are in fair condition, but pop the boots right out. Bindings were also inspected by REI. 

Salomon 174cm Scrambler Pilot 10 Hot:
I bought  these skis at the same time as the Scrambler 700s, and form the same shop. They were also in good condition when I purchased them and have been inspected and smoothed by REI since. The Salomon 5912 TI bindings are in fair condition, but pop the boots right out. Again, these bindings were inspected by REI. Both the bindings and the skis have only been used once since I bought them.

Two sets of boots come with the skis. The first set is a Nordica GTS 8, size 10 1/2, Ski Boot that has seen some use. The second set is a Tecnica Innotec TiR, size 10 1/2, Ski boot that has also seen use. Both sets of boots have been well used and show it on the outside as well as on the heel and toe lugs, but both pairs passed inspection buy REI last year and have only been used once since. The insides of the boots are in great condition and the padding is good.

Also I have included two sets of ski polls. 
- Maverick 46"" ski polls, NEW 
- Leki Force 50"" ski polls, Used

Be aware that all of this stuff, except the Maverick ski polls, is used, but not junk. I have taken good care of this equipment and would have loved to use it myself, but unfortunately it won't work for what I intended it for.

Just a thought from a Jarhead:

I love my ARs but when the SHTF I WANT an AK. 
If you ever have to use this in defense of your life, real world experience has taught me and the statistics back me up that range is not generally the deciding factor, neither is accuracy as you'll likely be bobbing and weaving as will the bad guy. Minute of man is just fine. It comes down to speed of deployment, reliability and the ability to defeat cover. The 7.62 x39 can engage past 300 yards but Ill call it a 300 yard round. That is more than generous in any likely scenario. What it does better than its contemporaries is destroy cover and run where few other systems can. Neither the 5.56 nor the 5.45 can hope to match the original AK's ability to deny the enemy cover and that's where the fight is won. Pick the right tool for the job. 


So here are the rules...

I got a magic number in my head a little lower than asking price. , First one to it without haggling gets it. I dont want the hassle of back and forth. Dont lowball me. Serious buyers only.


FTF for cash or FFL ok , you pay shipping and taxes.

These were put out by Beretta around the year 2000 and are set up different than a traditional Beretta 92 FS or an M9. Only 1000 were made for the USA and 1000 additional for the rest of the world.It has different serrations in the slide and its a little wider for better grip. It is made of nickel alloy steel so its heavier and easier to hold on target. It also has single action adjustable trigger sort of like a 1911 style pistol. It has special carbon fiber grips with the berretta logo medallion and Italian army markings on the slide. The gun doesnt appeared to be fired much, if any at all.I'm going to list it as used but could pass for brand new in the box except a little mark on the carbon fiber grips left of the medallion on one side. That is the only tiny flaw I see on the gun. Please feel free to email with any Questions. I will also ship the weapon to your FFL after I receive a certified check, money order. I will accept a personal check but I will wait for 10 days for it to clear. I will accept trades if they lean heavily in my favor, please keep in mind I normally buy guns at or below dealer cost so yours will be worth less than that."

Probably one of the best quality STANDARDIZED AK on the market
Weapon is tight with zero rattle. Condition is MINT. 
Kicklight RECOIL REDUCING CAR Stock and soft rubber recoil pad makes this feel almost like a 22 mag and allows for adjustable length of pull. . FANTASTIC feel when firing. Rubberized molded grip also enhance ergonomics. Side mount rail compatible . Optimized AK sight allows for WINDAGE And elevation correction. Ak sports a quad rail with rubber guards for optics integration as well as an upgraded compensator. Gas block is the modernized squared config that adds to the durability and service life as well as provides FULL enclosure of front sight post. 

Just a thought from a Jarhead:

I love my ARs but when the SHTF I WANT an AK. 
If you ever have to use this in defense of your life, real world experience has taught me and the statistics back me up that range is not generally the deciding factor, neither is accuracy as you'll likely be bobbing and weaving as will the bad guy. Minute of man is just fine. It comes down to speed of deployment, reliability and the ability to defeat cover. The 7.62 x39 can engage past 300 yards but Ill call it a 300 yard round. That is more than generous in any likely scenario. What it does better than its contemporaries is destroy cover and run where few other systems can. Neither the 5.56 nor the 5.45 can hope to match the original AK's ability to deny the enemy cover and that's where the fight is won. Pick the right tool for the job. 


So here are the rules...

I got a magic number in my head a little lower than asking price. , First one to it without haggling gets it. I dont want the hassle of back and forth. Dont lowball me. Serious buyers only."

Kicklight RECOIL REDUCING CAR Stock and soft rubber recoil pad makes this feel almost like a 22 mag and allows for adjustable length of pull. . FANTASTIC feel when firing. Rubberized molded grip also enhance ergonomics. Side mount rail compatible . Optimized AK sight allows for WINDAGE And elevation correction. Ak sports a quad rail with rubber guards for optics integration as well as an upgraded compensator. Gas block is the modernized squared config that adds to the durability and service life as well as provides FULL enclosure of front sight post. 

Just a thought from a Jarhead:

I love my ARs but when the SHTF I WANT an AK. 
If you ever have to use this in defense of your life, real world experience has taught me and the statistics back me up that range is not generally the deciding factor, neither is accuracy as you'll likely be bobbing and weaving as will the bad guy. Minute of man is just fine. It comes down to speed of deployment, reliability and the ability to defeat cover. The 7.62 x39 can engage past 300 yards but Ill call it a 300 yard round. That is more than generous in any likely scenario. What it does better than its contemporaries is destroy cover and run where few other systems can. Neither the 5.56 nor the 5.45 can hope to match the original AK's ability to deny the enemy cover and that's where the fight is won. Pick the right tool for the job.

That is a retail total of around $1500 (pre tax, S/H, FFL).  I am asking $1050, but will also consider cash offers.

Also, just for what its worth, the reason I am selling this rifle is that I’m getting out of rifles. With my astigmatism getting a clear focus on anything passed 50 yards (even with a scope) is rough on me.  Better off spending the time/money on practicing with my pistol / shotgun.  Only bringing this up since the gun is perfect, but wanted to give some background on why I am selling."

I am an FFL holder and have been selling out my entire stock of firearms since Nov. 10. I'm real close to being done. I had 3 of these when I started selling out, sold the first two immediately, and had determined to keep one for myself. I've changed my mind. 

It is new in the box. 
It has not even been loaded, but it has been fondled.

I purchased it, and the other two, on 7/24/2012 on the retail market beause I couldn't get one through my distributors.

I will accept CASH offers between now and Friday noon. 

Your offer is your total for the purchase. I'll pay the taxes that are due out of that.

Offers below $1306 are too low.

If you are an OK resident, you must be able to complete the transaction by Saturday noon (12/08/2012 - this Saturday) face to face in south Tulsa. 

If out of state, I must have a copy of the FFL from the dealer who will take delivery for you by Saturday noon, and I must have a money order by the following Tuesday. That may require you to send payment overnight. Out of state offers will be reduced by $50 to adjust for my shipping and insurance costs. If it isn't legal where you live, you don't get it. I will only ship to the lower 48 and not all of those. I will accept the FFL copy by email only. (if you are out of state, but close, you can pick this up face to face with a valid driver's license from your home state).

Please do not send an offer if you can't meet these conditions.

Local offers will trump offers requiring me to ship if they are equal otherwise. First offers will trump equal offers received later. Provide good contact information, so that delays in communication don't result in me having to contact the next in line.

Paperwork will be done and a background call will be made prior to transfer. A valid state driver's license is required and will be checked.

I will get pictures added to this post tonight sometime. 

I've tried to respond to all the emails over the last month of sales, although  I apologize for those I've missed. If you aren't the best offer on this, it simply won't be possible for me to respond, due to my schedule and would serve no purpose anyway.

I used this for about 100 shots and it works flawlessly, when selling the PSL I removed this block for using on the replacement rifle of the Vepr, unfortunately I purchased a Vepr with a Bull barrel so I cannot use this gas block. My loss your gain.

MSRP for this gas block is 100.00.

DEZ Arms, Inc. new adjustable AK-type gas block to be used on AK47 and variants, Romak 3 - PSL sniper rifles commonly used for military, law enforcement and civilian applications shot in semi-auto and full-auto modes. 

This regulated gas block is the major improvement over the former block. Once retrofitted on the firearm, adjustments can be dialed in -- off position for single shots for sub sonic ammo, to a full gas position for any load available. 

The gas block reduces recoil by allowing the proper flow of gas to cycle the bolt and carrier without hitting the rear trunion and buffer; thereby reducing damage to receiver rails and rivets in the rear trunion and rails. Bolt carrier racking caused by violent gas pressure slamming against the gas piston and carrier is reduced. Carbon build-up on the piston head and shaft are similarly reduced by directing unused gasses out the muzzle end of the barrel. 

This unique adjustable gas block enhances bullet velocity by using less gas to cycle the system. 

Simply mount the adjustable gas block to the barrel with four set screws, adjust the gas flow by turning the regulator -- in to decrease, out to increase the gas. Once the desired adjustment has been dialed in, lock the regulator by tightening the slotted nut. A screw driver, coin, or backside of a bullet can be used to precisely adjust the regulator. 

The adjustable gas block can quickly and easily be installed: Remove the front sites from the barrel by removing pins. Next remove pins from the old gas block. Then remove the existing block from the barrel. Lastly, install the adjustable gas block on barrel and align the gas port hole with the gas block port. Apply Lock-Tite to the set screw tips and tighten securely allowing time to dry.

If I had to take a guess, I would say the four wheeler has less than 50 hours on it total. Less than a year ago, I bought all 4 brand new tires for it, not because the others were worn but because I trail ride and the stock tires just weren't cutting it. The tires alone cost me $550 and have only been on 2 rides. Everything else on it is completely stock. I changed the oil after every ride (like a said, it was only rode about 2 times a year). There are absolutely zero malfunctions, dings, or major scratches. Just normal wear on the plastic, which is minimal. The only reason I'm selling it is because I recently purchased a RZR and this has to go. Asking $3500 but will entertain all reasonable offers.

Salomon 165cm Scrambler 700: 
These skis were used when I bought them from a local shop, but they are in great condition. Since buying the skis I have had them inspected and smoothed by REI, but have only used them once on a practice run. The Salomon 5710 bindings are in fair condition, but pop the boots right out. Bindings were also inspected by REI. 

Salomon 174cm Scrambler Pilot 10 Hot:
I bought  these skis at the same time as the Scrambler 700s, and form the same shop. They were also in good condition when I purchased them and have been inspected and smoothed by REI since. The Salomon 5912 TI bindings are in fair condition, but pop the boots right out. Again, these bindings were inspected by REI. Both the bindings and the skis have only been used once since I bought them.

Two sets of boots come with the skis. The first set is a Nordica GTS 8, size 10 1/2, Ski Boot that has seen some use. The second set is a Tecnica Innotec TiR, size 10 1/2, Ski boot that has also seen use. Both sets of boots have been well used and show it on the outside as well as on the heel and toe lugs, but both pairs passed inspection buy REI last year and have only been used once since. The insides of the boots are in great condition and the padding is good.

Also I have included two sets of ski polls. 
- Maverick 46"" ski polls, NEW 
- Leki Force 50"" ski polls, Used

Be aware that all of this stuff, except the Maverick ski polls, is used, but not junk. I have taken good care of this equipment and would have loved to use it myself, but unfortunately it won't work for what I intended it for.
