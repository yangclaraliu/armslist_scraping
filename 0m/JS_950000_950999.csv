This S10 comes with the 2.0 4 cyl engine with a 4 speed transmission. It runs strong and shifts good. Heat works pretty good and this is the long bed model. 

The three major bad things about is that the valve cover leaks. When I got it the previous owner didn't care to replace the valve cover gasket and let it leak all over the engine. It drips a little bit on the driveway a week so I didn't worry too much about it. The door latch doesn't close right. You really have to slam the door to shut it. Lastly, the drive belts squeak. All of these are cheap fixes. There are more little things here and there (carb choke gone= $4, hazard light bulb = $2 etc.) but overall it's a good truck.

My cash price is $1,000 obo. Make me an offer. I'll trade for another S10, Ranger, some other small 1/4 truck or gun stuff + cash. Your truck must be a 4cyl and have a manual transmission. I'm getting rid of my truck because I'd rather have a short bed. If you spend maybe $50 on this truck you will have a pretty good cheap truck. Email me or text me for pictures or more details. NO CALLS. 317-292-65fortyfive. I'd rather stay around Greenwood since I don't have plates for the truck. Clean title though."

This brass is 100% WCC made from once fired 5.56. It has a stronger primer pocket compared to the other brass I run and I seem to get more reloadings from it comparatively. Primer pockets are swagged, not reemed, just enough that the primers go in while still giving it a snug fit for long life. I trim the brass to 1.355 which is closer to the lower tolerance so your brass should last longer between trimmings. The way these are trimmed some might have a slight burr on the inside of the case. These can be removed with a deburring chamfer or running them through a resizing die. I dont think it necessarily needs removed and I dont when I reload them. Shipping is not included but flat rate is pretty reasonable. I take PayPal (gift or +3.5%) or postal mo. PayPal however will get you the fastest shipping. This is made to order so shipping will not be immediate. I might have more at a later date. No trades at this time, email me if you want a smaller lot but that rates are higher."

The 1970's-1980's normally is chambered for 5.56 or 5.56 NATO

The Beretta M9A1 evolved from the base design of the battle-tested and proven M9 pistol, with input from military and law enforcement agencies around the world. Developed to meet the demanding requirements of the U. S. Marine Corps, the M9A1 incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9, with added features needed for the ever-changing missions of peacekeeping forces:

A. 3-Dot Sight System: Like the 92FS, the M9A1 features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target.
B. Sure, Firm Grip: The front and backstraps of the frame are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions.
C. Accessory Rail: The frame of the M9A1 has a
 Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment
 of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
D. Magazine Well Bevel: The magazine well has
 an aggressive internal bevel to facilitate fast tactical reloads in combat situations.
E. Sand-Resistant Magazine: Developed for the
 sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan, this unique magazine comes standard only on the M9A1.

The special PVD coating reduces friction, while the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of sand accumulation within the round column, greatly increasing
 the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 in desert or other extreme conditions.

ORIGINAL POST: UP FOR TRADE: http://www.armslist.com/posts/927829/tampa-handguns-for-sale-trade--trade-or-sale--taurus-pt92---17-shot-clip--150-rounds--9mm

I would be the only hunter wishing to hunt your land. On maybe a few occassions, my wife would come with or possibly my brother-in-law, BUT only 1 extra hunter at a given time.  I don't drink while hunting. I'm respectful to the land and owners wishes. I'm more than happy to split the meat with the owner if you would enjoy it. I AM FINE WITH SIGNING A NO-LIABILITY STATEMENT or whatever the owner would need to be comfortable with the arrangement.

I own a small business in Tampa and do not get out hunting enough to make a hunting lease economical for me. I would like to do a small amount of hunting in each of the seasons for small game, turkey and deer. 

In Wisconsin, I had permission from a farmer who gave my father and I the right to hunt through-out the seasons. We weren't pigs about it. We would each shoot a deer and do some goose hunting. We were the only ones permitted to hunt. It costed us a few bottles of Johnnie Walker and some processed deer sausage and a Christmas Card. This was our hunting grounds for 10+ years until I moved to Florida. Hunting arrangements like this seem to be a thing of the past, as times have changed, but I'm more than fine with trading my PT92 Taurus with clips and ammo to break the ice.

I live in Tampa. Let me know what you have to offer for HUNTING LAND/PROPERTY. 

Email me with any questions you may have. OR any restrictions or concerns you may have. I don't blame you if you would like to meet up before commiting......thats fine with me and would like to view the property before commiting myself.

PLEASE DESCRIBE YOUR PROPERTY IN ACRES, LOCATION IN FLORIDA AND OTHER GENERAL INFO THAT COULD BE USEFUL.

MFG Description:
These shotguns are made in the U.S.A., insuring exacting parts match and a superior fit/finish. Using a common receiver and trigger group, the Citadel LE comes in four models: Spec-Ops, Talon, Pistol Grip with Heat Shield and Standard. All models feature a lightweight receiver, 7 +1 magazine capacity, 20 inch barrel, ergonomic forend, quick feed short stroke pump and rifle style sights. The Spec-Ops model features the BLACKHAWK!® Spec-Ops stock, which is adjustable for 4 inches of LOP, and estimated at absorbing up to 70% of felt recoil. The Spec-Ops gets you on target quickly – and keeps you there shot after shot. The Talon model also offers 70% felt recoil reduction with a skeletonized thumbhole stock from BLACKHAWK! that permits free hand movement with even the heaviest of gloves, and a short, 13.5 inch LOP. Finally, the Pistol Grip and Standard models offer a traditional, synthetic stock with a fixed, 13.5 inch LOP.

The kit will come with the original wood furniture, pistol grip, trigger group, and slant cut muzzle brake (if I can find it. If not, I will give you the brake on it now or a barrel nut; your choice). Forked trunnion is not included, everything else you see is (even a tapco g2 and red star arms retaining plate).

*Will ship anywhere it is legal, no FFL required to receive kit. 
*To comply with Federal Law, the receiver will be cut up.
*It is completely legal to build your own semi-auto arms as long as you are legal to own arms and are not manufacturing for commerce and stays in your possession if you bent the flat into a receiver yourself. If you buy a completed receiver from sources like NoDak Spud, it can be sold like any other arms.

It takes regular steel AR mags.  It is completely ambidextrous, the shells eject out the front, so no brass getting ejected in your face.  If you reload your ammo it is great because the shells fall at your feet, put down a tarp, and all your brass is ready to go.  It is 27 inches long with a 17 inch barrel(1 in 7 twist).  It has a 5.56 chamber so go can fire .223 or 5.56.  It has less than 500 rounds through it, and is basically one of my safe queens.  Still have the original box, FN cleaning kit, instruction manual, and an extra foregrip with a light mounted inside of it with an external pressure switch.  Will sell it with one 30 round magazine.

I don't need to sell it, so my price is firm, would be interested in some trades, but I am picky when it comes to my firearms."

This rifle is in good shape and comes with 1 seven round magazine. The magazines are nearly impossible to find. This rifle has the plastic stock with a collapsible butt plate. Years ago Daisy initiated a voluntary recall on these rifles but this one was never sent back to the factory. This rifle is therefore completely original. The recall details are below and was initiated due to a problem where pulling the trigger may release more than one round. This rifle has not had that ""problem"" and functions as intended. Here is the release from Daisy.

It  has been determined that the sear or disconnect may break on the Legacy  semiautomatic rifles which may permit the gun to discharge more than  one round with a single pull of the trigger. Because of this condition,  Daisy has elected to recall all Legacy 2203 and 2213 semiautomatic  rifles and replace the sear and disconnect components. The rifle will be  repaired and returned at no charge to the owners."
