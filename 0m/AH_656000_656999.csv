- forged government length frame, checkered front strap
- ambi thumb safeties
- magwell

Then made the following changes:

- Had the slide, barrel, and barrel bushing Robar NP3 coated
- Changed the mag release to an EGW HD Higher Mag Catch

- barrel ramp welded by Virgil Tripp 
- trigger job by Virgil Tripp
- Aftec extractor

Comes with:
- 7 Tripp 40S&W mags with alloy basepads
- 1 Tripp 10mm maf with plastic basepad

I bought this gun for USPSA Single Stack competition.  The barrel welding and higher mag catch were done to improve reliability, as these 40 caliber 1911s can be finicky.  Barrel welding was done after NP3 coating, so some of the coating is missing in the feed ramp area (barrel is stainless, no corrosion concerns).  This one now runs great using Precision Delta 180gr FMJ, the only bullet I have tried in it.  For those that don't know, Virgil Tripp was the ""T"" in STI.  

Has less than 500 rounds through it.

It has dual tanks, new bucket seats with fold down concole. It's has a brush guard on the front of it. The transmission is a turbo 400 and needs replaced. I have found one here in Choctaw for 200.00 and will get it and put in it but will have to raise the price when i do. The back bumper is custom with 2 KC light mounted in the bumper. there are 2 spots cut out for the lights and they work! I also have another set of wheels and tires to go with it. This truck runs like a champ, besides the transmission. I average 12 mpg in it I also installed a sony cd player with detacable face and speakers. The body is in good shape, the only dent is in the passenger door where my cows lend into it and the hood has a buckle on both sides which is normal for these trucks. I just drove this truck to Clinton and back deer hunting this year. This truck does alot of sitting and i would like someone to buy it and get some enjoyment out of it. You can call or text me anytime for any questions 405-three 7 zero- zero629! ASKING 3000.00 OR BEST OFFER OR TRADE"

----
I am selling an Arsenal SLR107F, which are top-shelf AK rifles with Bulgarian-made chrome-lined hammer-forged barrel, Bulgarian stamped receiver, and side-folding stock. Chambered in 7.62x39mm. Read more at http://www.k-var.com/shop/SLR107-21.html. If you are looking for a modern, Com Bloc factory-built mil-spec AK, this is it!

I am the original owner and have not fired this rifle, so it is in as-new condition. This rifle has been factory test-fired and zeroed. Folding stock locks up tight, sights are straight as an arrow.

Comes with original box and accessories (manual, test fire sheet, 5rd magazine, cleaning rod, sling, oil bottle, buttstock cleaning kit).

The SLR 107 rifles had not been imported and out of stock for years until this summer, but looks like the supply is running down again. If you want a real, Bulgarian military AK, don't wait! The AK market is mercurial to say the least. 

Asking $1,050 cash FTF.

I am consolidating calibers to 5.45x39mm so will consider trades for high-quality, well-built AK-74 rifles (SGL31-84, Krebs and other custom builds, etc).

Thanks for looking!"

The Benelli M1 semi-automatic shotgun based on the proprietary Benelli system, which utilizes the gun recoil and inertia of the moving parts to operate the action. This system was developed by Benelli by the mid-1980s, and is simple and reliable in operation. System utilizes the rotating bolt head with two locking lugs that lock into the barrel extension. The bolt is mounted inside the massive bolt body (bolt carrier), and fixed to it by the locking pin, which allows the bolt head to move slightly forward and back and rotate simultaneously within the bolt body. The massive inertia spring is interposed between the boldbody and head, and separate recoil spring is located in the buttstock, pressing the bolt body forward via the link at its rear. When bolt is in the battery, the locking lugs of the bolt head are engaged with the barrel and locked it. Inertiaspring, pressing on the both bolt body and head, holds the head in the forward position relative to the body. When gun is fired, it recoils and moves backslightly against shoulder of the shooter. Due to the inertia of the bolt body,it resists the initial recoil movement, so the bolt head, locked rigidly with the barrel and the rest of the gun, moves back relative to the bolt body,compressing the inertia spring and rotating itself to unlock due to the headlocking pin being encaged in the cam slot in the bolt body. As soon as the rotation of the head is enough to unlock the bolt head from the barrel, the residual pressure of the barrel pushes the bolt head back, and this, in turn,pushes the bolt body against the recoil spring, overcoming the bolt body inertial and commencing the reloading cycle (ejection of the spent case and feeding and chambering of the fresh round). As soon as the bolt group returns into the battery, the pressure of the compressed inertia spring pushes the bolt body slightly back against the bolt head, causing the bolt head to rotate and lock into the barrel. Now, gun is ready for the next shot. This sounds quite complicated, but the whole system is mechanically very simple and has few moving parts, resulting in high reliability and easy production and maintenance.

The Benelli M1 shotgun is no more than the system described above, built inside the aluminum alloy receiver and  mated with conventional under barrel tube magazine and polymer stock, which is available with semi-pistol or pistol grip. Sights options are traditional shotgun sights,rifle type open sights or ghost-ring (diopter) sights. Mounts for laser pointers, tactical flashlights and red dot scopes also available on the market. 

Overall, the Benelli M1 is a high-quality shotgun, available in numerous versions for both civilian, law enforcement and military use."

I have a ruger sr9 full size for trade only at this time. It has the black frame and stainless slide. It is in good condition and comes with one hi cap mag. I will add pictures when/if I have time. 

I am looking for trades only. Not for sale. The only thing I really want is a ruger lcr in 357.  Only other thing I might consider is fde or od glocks or a judge in stainless with a 3 inch chamber. . I'm fair with trades and will make a fair deal with cash. Be realistic also. If you want new retail for your used gun I'd ask the same. If you want to pay used price for mine, I'll give used credit for yours. Prices on here are usually overvalued as is expected on a free classified site. I have the internet and a copy of the blue book of gun values. Be realistic. 

Finally, email what you  have and what you'd expect in trade. Also due to huge spam counts, I will not answer any emails without a name and phone number. I won't answer anything that can be found here. And if this is here I still have it. Finally, in state only, over 21, with id, no felons.  And I'll drive up to an hour if worth it."

First off, I'm not sold on the idea of selling this 1911, I am more than tempted to keep it. So, if you want it, convince me. It would be a great 1911 to customize further for CCW work, which is why I picked it up in the first place.

Secondly, it's a unique piece, from the early/mid 90s, the M968 was the custom-shop precursor to the current 'lightweight' champion. I say custom-shop because it was built to spec for the original buyer from Springfield, and they wouldn't tell me who that was of course. 

Here are some features:
1) Pachmayr wrap-around grips and mainspring housing
2) Right-handed extended safety 
3) Beveled magwell 
4) Skeletonized hammer and trigger 
5) Original, parkerized finish
6) Original barrel bushing, guide rod, spring, and reverse plug setup 
7) 4"" barrel 

It has regular wear from use/holstering over the years, but runs great. I have yet to find ammo it doesn't like. I've put about 250 rounds through it, no idea how many from prior owners.

What I have is a practically brand new in the box Taurus Judge Public Defender.  It is the smaller polymer frame with two inch barrel and fiber optic front sight.  It takes 2 1/2"" 410 shells and/or 45 longs.  The gun is 99.5% new condition.  It has never been fired, aside from the factory testing.  I am the original owner.  I won this in a raffle so I figured I would buy ammo while I am in the store picking up my ""free"" gun.  So this will come with two full boxes of Winchester PDX1 410 shells (20 total shells) and a full box of Hornady Critical Defense 45 Long (20 total shells), I have upwards of $70 in the ammo.  Both types of ammo were made for the Judge, and can be bought in premixed combo packs as well.  Anyway, I loaded it one time, and now I have unloaded it one time.  Aside from that it has set in my bedside safe untouched and unfired.  It has never been fired, merely loaded once and unloaded once.  I am only selling to fund another toy, besides that, I didn't enter the raffle to win this gun.

I have had this sold for $550 w/ the ammo.  I am relisting only because the guy welched on the deal and left me hanging like a true asshole.  So, for those who want to talk numbers...I know what and where they sell for.  I see these for $500 and up, and down.  Regardless...this one is $550 firm.  If you would like to haggle, then start at $600 and I will haggle down to $550.  Your choice how you look at it, hell we can start at $1100 and you can have it for half price.

As for trades...while I do love guns and am lucky enough to own and have owned numerous guns, I do value them at what they are worth to me.  You are making a deal with me after all, not a book, website, dealer, etc.  So, if you have something that makes me drool then you will probably get your way...if not, then sorry if I insult you with a lesser value.  I don't mean to be a dick, but I am good at it.  You won't offend me, so don't be afraid to try.  If you don't think think I am fair, then simply don't make a deal with me.  I am open to most any offer, the worst I can say is no.  All said though, I love cash!  It's probably my most favorite trade...your money for my gun.  Should the right trade offer arise, I do have cash and will trade up though.  And I am willing to trade down for they right offer also.

If you see this, it is still available.  If you are the shlepp who stood me up,  sorry if something bad happened...but three days and no word to phone or email, really?"

This firearm is extremely rare to find these days and I believe it is the best tactical pistol on the market.

This has a competition trigger and once the trigger is pulled you get a 2-3lb trigger pull on the following round.

I'm Dave, a disabled veteran who enjoys target shooting, or as I call it; ""Group Therapy."" I have been working on my dream AR build; basically a fully automatic rifle just like the rifles carried by our brave men and women in the armed forces every day...and very much like the one I carried when I had the honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Army. In short, building a fully automatic custom AR is quite expensive involving government laws, regulations and of course taxes, tariffs and fees. While doing research early one morning, since sleep eluded me once more and which just so happens to be Veteran's day, (HOOAH!), I stumbled up this website and figured why not?!?

Now I know there are A LOT more noble causes and better reasons to donate money and I'm not asking anyone to give who is anti-gun, or does not have a few dollars to throw this way toward this nut, but as always and especially if I succeed with this crazy endeavor, I invite all my family and friends to join me at the range and shoot this and every other firearm I own. Truth be told I am a little embarrassed I did this, but since I already linked it to my Facebook account and it posted an update on my timeline, I’m already committed!

So if you can; GREAT! If you can’t, wish me luck and for those of you that know me know I will document every step of this journey in writing and of course, with pictures. J  Please feel free to spread the word as I’m curious to see how many like-minded people there are out there.

If this works, I will definitely use this site again, but for one of those more noble causes I wrote about earlier in this early morning rambling. If you can donate to the cause, please email me via the link below.

Thanks for looking and for your donations.
