Cleans supper fast, takes down quick. Uses common tools and you can adjust the gas setting with a bullet tip. You can also buy conversion kits that take less than 30 seconds to install, making this a versatile platform.

Takes all the AR mags, but prefers brass over steel case. It will shoot steel case, but like all ARs, it is a dirty powder and requires the gas block to be at highest setting. 

It does shoot the steel case accurately. Just runs smoother w/ brass.

The Marine Corps has gone to FN for their M16 upper assemblies, this is in my opinion, the best of the best.  Was told the Army is doing the same, but that I can't verify.

Best performance if using 62-77gr ammo.

This is a deadly accurate 500m weapon as configured.

If you want a Knight's Armament M5 Rail system added to the rifle, add $225.00 to the price.

Includes a new drop down optics rail that attaches to the carryhandle and puts the optics forward and above the handguards.  Great for reflex sights.


This is basically exactly what I was issued in boot camp in 1985.

The steel-core, Heavier Than Steel pellets have a copper coating nearly 22 times as thick as traditional copper-plated shot, giving them high density and energy. Innovative construction delivers more pellets in a 30"" circle than traditional Hevi-Shot.

Comes with original foam filled case, 3 original 17 round magazines, 1 - 30 round magazine (extra item), Folbus GL2 holster (extra item), Rubber pistol grip sleeve, Glock ammo loader device, and a 2  magazine belt carrier.    This pistol fires very good and has no issues.   It has always been reliable.  Minor scuffs on corners, nothing major. I am an occasional shooter and I have shot 300+ rounds through it. I am the second owner and bought it from another seller who needed cash.

Read the reviews and gun forums on the black v-bob.  You will not find a better 1911 for the money, hands down.  Here are the details from DW's website: 

The V-Bob is loaded with features, including a forged Bobtail frame with 25 LPI checkering front and back, an undercut trigger guard, Heinie Ledge Straight Eight night sights, VZ slim line G10 grips, EGW carry bevel bushings, Ed Brown grip safety and mainspring housings, as well as our tool-steel fire controls and other premium small parts. Every piece that goes into the Valor series is hand-fit, polished and blended to provide you with not only the best functioning gun we can provide, but also the best looking. 

This V-Bob is coated in the super durable black Duty finish. This finish is a ceramic base-coating that has set the standard for all coating tests. No polymer-based coating can compare.

I'll also throw in a $75 black leather holster that is very similar to a Crossbreed but better because instead of Kydex over leather, it's leather over leather.  Kydex is loud and can scratch the gun's finish.   Leather fixes both issues.  The ride depth and kant are both fully adjustable and this holster has never been worn.

By far my favorite 1911 I've ever owned, and I've had quite a few from Les Baers all the way down to Springfields.

The gun has one of the lowest bore axis in it's class, reducing recoil dramatically.

Eotech XPS3-0 Transverse Red Dot Holosight - Night Vision Compatible 

Eotech Transverse XPS 3 Holo Sight is EOTech's shortest model sight yet! Smaller than previous models including the EOTech 550, the Transverse XPS Three runs on a single 123 battery. It also has a longer battery life than other models of HOLO sights. The XPS3 is smaller, lighter and always fast. This is the-0 reticle options. With the new single battery configuration, the Night Vision Xps allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights or NV mount. 

G23.FTS

The G23 offers fast transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, incredible field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. The G23 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.

 It offers a comfortable eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand. The Flip to Side mount is incredibly durable and operates by pressing the lever on the side of the mount causing the magnifier to ""flip"" to the side and out ofthe way. The G23 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.


3x magnifier with Flip-To-Side mount and quick detach. Works with thhe XPS3

The Official Gun Digest Book of Guns & Prices, 2007:
""The Model 39A Lever-Action Rifle is an improved version of the Model 39. It has a heavier, tapered round barrel, semi-beavertail forearm and a redesigned pistol-grip stock. The Model 39's rubber buttplate was replaced by one made of synthetic fiber; otherwise, specifications were similar to the Model 39. The Model 39A was manufactured from 1939 to 1960. Pre-war variations (1939-1941): case-colored receiver with no serial number prefix (1939), or ""B"" prefix (1940-1941).""

.22 S/L/LR Lever-Action . . . 24-in. Round Barrel . . . Black Walnut Buttstock & Forearm, finish removed from Buttstock.

Case Hardened Receiver, Lever and Trigger. Some rust on the Barrel and Magazine Tube, but someone who knows what they're doing could clean it up and have a nice vintage 39A.

It is about 1.5 years old and has seen around 500 rounds.

Factory Specs:

[url=http://savagearms.com/firearms/model/10FCPK]Savage Arms[/url]

The Good:


[*]Inletted and installed CDI Bottom Metal (~$200 value)
[*]The Bottom Metal has been tuned for a tight fit and to feed 75Gr AMAX bullets with a full magazine length COL.  The bolt throw limiter has been ground down to allow for the longer rounds.
[*]AICS .223 10 Round Magazine (~$40 value)
[*]I had this gun at Douglas Ridge a month ago and hit the steel gong 19/20 shots in rapid fire at 600 yards.  The missed shot was in no way the fault of this gun.  I have had several sub-moa groups with many different loads.
[*]Includes a 5/8-24 Thread Protector
[*]Includes the original bottom metal and two 4 round .223 magazines. (could probably be sold for $40)



The Bad:

[*]Some light wear marks on the stock.
[*]Some light wear marks on the action and DBM but not too many.
[*]This gun has the bottom bolt release and IMO the CDI DBM method for dealing with this was kind of hokey so I just left it off and stick my finger up inside the trigger area to toggle the release.
[*]You may want to clean it (although I don't think it needs it).
[*]I took the Muzzle Brake off but will include it.


Cost: $700 Cash - No trades or haggling at this time.

Will need to see WA DL and proof of state residency for at least three months if your DL is recent issue but don't need to record the info.

FTF sales only in the East Vancouver to Washougal area. I'm pretty busy these days so I can't do long drives and can't drop everything to meet you in an hour.

The Good:

[*]It's only a few months old and has only seen about 50 rounds through it.
[*]It has been bedded with Devcon and the fore-end stiffened with devcon and brass rods.  
[*]It has an EGW 20MOA Picatinny Rail on top (~$40 value).
[*]The stock has an Atlasworx AI Compatible DBM installed (~$200 value).
[*]It comes with all the original parts and box (except for one original action screw that I scavenged for another project).
[*]It comes with one used AI 10 Round .308 Magazine (~$70 value).
[*]It should shoot 1 MOA or less if you are using decent ammo or handloads in the 168 - 175 grain bullet range.  It shot very well for me.


The Bad:

[*]I didn't do the greatest job inletting the cheap rubbery Hogue stock.  The rubber was harder than I thought to work with.  I filled in the gaps around the DBM with Devcon but it won't win any beauty contests. See the pics.
[*]The fore-end stiffening was done to keep weight to a minimum - it's functional but not beautiful.
[*]If you want to use the factory DBM you will have to buy another stock - I removed too much material to re-use the factory bottom metal.  The stocks for this gun are going pretty cheap so it won't be hard to find one.

Best of the best.  If you know what it is you're interested.  If you don't and you want an AK be sure to read below.  These don't come available very often.  It is in like new condition. 

I am selling an as new Bulgarian made Arsenal SLR-101S AK rifle, caliber 7.62x39mm. The SLR101 is made in Bulgaria and imported as a complete rifle. This means both the receiver and barrel are original Arsenal BG milspec. Rifle comes with 1 Bulgarian made 40rd. magazine and sling. The original Soviet Russian AK47 utilized a milled receiver from the late 1940s until the adoption of the less expensive and lighter AKM in 1959. Most other Warsaw Pact nations followed suit and switched from the milled AK47 to the stamped AKM. While Arsenal in Bulgaria did manufacture stamped rifles starting in the 1960s, it never abandoned the milled design and continued to update and modernize it. The Bulgarian military has been using these weapons for decades, in various configurations.
Back in 2001, Arsenal Inc. of NV in the USA imported a milled rifle from Arsenal of Bulgaria called the SLR101. This rifle had an original Bulgarian made milled receiver, as well as an original Bulgarian barrel. This line was discontinued 10 years ago and only in 2012 has Arsenal once again imported a batch of SLR101s. Arsenal has done the SA M7 line with a milled receiver, but with one key difference; the SA M series used a US made milled receiver and other US parts. The SLR101 is wholly made in Bulgaria and is imported into the US as a complete weapon. It is brought in without a bayonet lug and with a thumbhole stock, to get around import restrictions. Once in the country, Arsenal Inc. installs a proper butt stock, pistol grip, and muzzle brake. They also insure the rifle is capable of accepting any standard AK double stack, high capacity magazines. All parts are Bulgarian made, except for the required 922(r) ones. These parts are made in the USA by Arsenal, but to original Bulgarian specifications and include: the furniture set, trigger group, and muzzle brake.
Comparing the 2012 SLR101-13 to the 2001 SLR101s, the same manufacturing quality and fit and finish can be found. Since the 2001 rifles were sold during the 1994 Clinton AWB, they were not allowed to have either the removable muzzle device, threaded barrel, or bayonet lug. These modern SLR101 rifles though have all of these features as the AWB sunset in 2004.
This rifle features: original Arsenal of Bulgaria AK47 style milled receiver, original 16"" long Cold Hammer Forged barrel with a chrome lined bore, standard 14mm threads on the end of the barrel, side-mount on the receiver for optics, a smooth double hook trigger, intermediate length polymer butt stock, milspec polymer hand guards with steel heat shield, standard military pistol grip, and the ability to accept any standard AK47/AKM magazines and drums. These milled Arsenals are known for their reliability and trouble-free service; but if it does have any problems, it is fully covered under Arsenal's warranty. It has been a decade since any milled receiver rifles have come in from Bulgaria and I don't think I am out of line in saying they are some of the finest AK pattern rifles ever produced. All moving parts work smoothly; the rifle is very accurate, durable, and great looking."

With the pinned flash hider the barrel is 16"" and meets the requirements for a rifle. Please note: FLASH HIDER IS PINNED ON AND CANNOT BE REMOVED WITHOUT GUNSMITHING, THERE IS NO DELTA RING. This barrel is ready to mount onto an upper, but can only be used with a free floating rail/handguard that does not require removal of the muzzle device or a delta ring. For example: the Troy Industries Battlerails will work perfectly. The barrel has only had a few rounds fired for testing purposes and is in excellent like new condition. I've had this for a while and decided not to use it for a build. A new barrel cost around $300, plus $60 for the flash hider. Please call if interested. REDACTED"
