I will entertain any serious offer. These rifles are rarely available used and this one is in wonderful condition. 
For those Browning enthusiasts out there, this rifle was made in Japan, not Belgium. 
SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE! 
I can meet interested buyers in and around the Vancouver/Portland area. Also, rifle can be shipped through a local licensed dealer however buyer is responsible for shipping cost on top of purchase price. 
Thanks

For sale is a Yugo SKS with a Serbian cross and some cyrillic characters carved into the stock.  When I got it, I didn't know what it was.  Now I don't want the gun of some Milosevic militiaman haunting my closet.  It works great, shoots great, has a milled receiver and the bayonet/grenade launcher attachments. Not riced out. Asking $250 or best reasonable offer.  Open to firearm trades.  Can post/email pics upon request.

If you don't have an SKS yet, they're neat guns.  Useful, historical and cheap.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKS"

 The second knife is a tanto made from a big wood file. Its chisel ground and extremely sharp. The handle is is textured with 3m griptape then wrapped in the traditional japanese tsukomaki style. I have not made a sheath for it but will for a small additional charge.
 I also make paracord wraps unlike any found anywhere i have seen. those can be seen in the background of the first picture. Those vary in price from 15 to 25 depending on pattern.

The larger upper in the picture is an Olympic Arms heavy bull barrel upper chambered in a 25 WSSM (Winchester Super Short Mag). If you dont know much about these you can research them. They are etremely fast and are capable of taking game at 600+ yards with ease. The upper will work on any AR lower and so will the magazine. I have a box of shells and 1 mag that goes with it.
The lower that is pictured is a DPMS 5.56/.223 lower with sights and free float hand guards. It functions great.
The short upper pictured is meant for an AR pistol. It will work on a rifle lower as well however, since the barrel is so short you may need to check and see if it needs any registration to go on a rifle lower. You can mount it on a pistol lower with no legal issues. I don't know much about it other than it shoots nice and looks cool. It does come with the Bushnell red dot scope that is in the pic. I also have a couple magazines and about $100 rounds of .223 that will go with it.
I received these on a trade. I have quite a few ARs and need to clear the gun case out. Looking to get $900 for the 25WSSM upper, $250 for the DPMS lower and $650 for the shorter upper with a couple mags and ammo. I dont want to sell the lower unless an upper is purchased as well. I wont humor a stupid low ball offer. I will sell all 3 of these together for $1600 FIRM.

Im not interested in even trades. I need to pay some bills off.

This is a Smith and Wesson M&P 340 chambered in .357 Mag with XS tritium night sights and internal lock. I installed Hogue monogrips to increase the grip length, and they have a padded backstrap to make shooting magnum rounds much more comfortable. It is very easy to conceal and shoots nicely. This is one of my carry guns, so it does show some minor cosmetic wear (Cylinder drag line, 2 scratches on the side plate, a mark on an edge of the trigger guard and a ding on the lower-right corner of the barrel shroud, but not the on barrel itself). This gun was built to be used and abused, so the added wear builds character. 

I'm selling because I’ve inherited another j-frame and don’t see the point in keeping more than one.

Buyer must present a valid Colorado driver’s license and sign a bill of sale. CHP/military/LEO preferred. Face to face sale in the immediate Fort Collins area.

Great CCW package:

-Kahr CM9 with professionally installed Trijicon Night Sites (2 months old)
-1 Don Hume leather IWB holster ($30 retail)
-1 Crossbreed Mini-Tuck IWB holster ($65 retail)
-Round count about 300rnds, so that puts it right over Kahr's 200rnd break-in period
-No marks from carrying. Great condition.

Possible trade for rifle of equal or lesser value.  I'm just looking for something for home/shooting range, but nothing high-dollar.  Maybe an SKS+ammo  etc... Something that I can buy bulk/military surplus ammo for so trips to the range don't kill me.  No .22's though please.  

*Note: The ammo and DeSantis pocket holster are not included.

Must have CCW permit or pistol purchase permit, provide copy of all licenses and sign Bill of Sale.

Thanks for looking."

Gun functions perfectly and is a nice little piece for a collection.

Bernardelli enter into the gun business in 1631 first making barrels in Gardone Val Trompia, Brescia Italy. In 1865 Vincenzo Bernardelli founded the company which still exist today. In the 1920's Bernardelli also manufactured componets for Alfa Romeo aircraft engins. In the 1930's they made an Italian service revelover know as the System Bodeo, Model 1889. They are also know for crafting very high-end shotguns. After World War II, Bernardelli introduced its first self-loading pistol, the VP (Vest Pocket) Model, which was based on the Walther Model 9.

The Bernardelli VP is a very small blowback-operated striker-fired .25 caliber (6.35 mm) pistol with a barbell-shaped takedown latch at the rear. It has a full length slide that covers the 2"" barrel, with an external extractor on the right side, an internal connector on the left side; a 5 shot magazine that incorporates a magazine safety.

I have the original box. I will separate items.

I bought the rifle on 12/23/11 from an individual who bought it from another individual. He said that he was told the rifle had been shot very little. He said that he had shot it very little as well. I ran a couple of wet patches down the bore and put it in the safe. My gunsmith bore scoped the rifle on 1/5/12. He said the throat and rifling looked brand new. I loaded 10 rounds with 73.0 grains of Hodgdon H4831SC powder, Federal no. 215 primers, and Sierra 180 grain MatchKings with a C.O.L. of 3.5 inches (which was .01” off of the lands and grooves). The rounds loaded into the magazine. I used this recipe because it was what I had lying around. I would have rather used Retumbo with 220 grain Berger VLDs. I did everything to the brass except turn the necks. I shot the rifle on 1/5/12 to make sure the scope tracked and to check accuracy. It was pretty windy. I shot one round from a cold, clean bore. I then moved 8 clicks right and shot, 8 clicks down and shot, 8 clicks left and shot, and the 8 clicks up and shot (see photo). I took a small break and looked at the target and marked it. I also adjusted the scope. I then shot 5 rounds. The cold bore shot went a little high and left as did the first cold bore shot. The other 4 shots went into a .32 inch group (see photo). I was shooting at 100 yards. Pretty impressive for just throwing some ammo together!

Comes with the original 10-round clip.

Included is a brand new Rex scope,a front grip,and a muzzle flash hider.

Gun was $319.00plus tax($337.00
Front grip was $20.00
Muzzle flash hider was $18.00
Rex scope was $59.00 plus tax ($63.60)

All these accesories were put on when i bought the gun.

I have this priced cheaper than you can go buy a new rifle with no add ons/accesories  Why buy a new one. I feel i have this priced very fair for only shooting it one time and with all the extras. There is no case. What you see in the photo is exactly what you will be getting. Nothing else. Ammo is cheap locally at $9.47 for a 50-round box.

I might also consider a trade/cash deal for a high powered military/assault rifle or?
I can come up with cash if your gun is worth more than mine.

The stock is in very good condition with some signs of normal ware for its age, and there is some normal wear and some scrapes on the reciver and charging handle. Comes with 1 inch scope rings. I am only interested in trading firearms though.

I will sell it for $90, but would rather trade it. I can add more money with the model 60 if needed.

Windshield cracked. Trans slipping shifts hard sometimes and sometimes wont shift but will still do 70 miles per hour on the highway couple thousand rpms under the red line even when it wont shift into higher gear. Only had the not shifting problem a handful of times usually I pull over for 5 minutes and turn it off then it works fine. Could need a flush could need a new tranny havent had it checked I have to many vehicles in the yard so this one can go. My luck if i have the tranny flushed I will need a new transmission but if i sell it it will work great for the next person who knows. Had it less than 2 years it has 160k miles, tires are in good shape and under warranty at walmart. Since I have had it I have fixed the brakes, steering, power steering, radiator not sure what else im forgetting. I want $800 for it or trade for semi auto pistol in caliber 40 and above like xd,m&p i may even trade it for rifle or crapload of ammo i always need ammo in popular calibers, reloading supplies who knows make me an offer if its not across the state and your serious I can probably drive it to you.

It comes with the following upgrades/accessories:

** Williams Triggers Contoured Trigger job with a 3.5-4lb pull
** Custom Fit HK Wide Forearm
** NRA Sports Optics 3x9 Scope
** Seven 20 Round magazines
** Original thin forearm
** Rear HK style drum/peep sight
** Appx 160rds of .308 ammo

I had the trigger pack sent out to Williams Triggers to be worked on and the results were amazing. The gun went from having about a 12lb trigger that made it almost impossible to hit anything to breaking clean and crisp right around 3.5lbs. Due to the receiver being cast rather than stamped metal on a standard HK-91 the wide forearm had to be cut down to fit this rifle but it now fits snugly and is much more user friendly than the original stock version. It has the ability to mount an HK bipod if you so choose. The rifle is a bit ammo picky but oddly enough it shoots incredible with the cheap 150grn Monarch Ammo from Academy and can regularly pop 2"" clay targets at 200yds.

I'm selling because I no longer have a local area to shoot long ranges at and I would like to raise money for a new AR build. As this is my last remaining .308 I'll throw in all the ammo I have for it. Let me know if there are any questions."

Here is some info I found out about this gun.

The Intratec TEC DC-9 ""assault pistol"", also known as DC-9, TEC-9, or, if manufactured after 1994, as AB-10, bears the dubious distinction of being one of the most widely used ""criminal"" guns in USA. It was used in several mass murder cases, as well as in unknown, but definitely large number of street fights and other violent crimes. TEC-9 became ""famous"" for its ""evil"" appearance, large magazine capacity (which offered significant firepower), and for low price. Unsurprisingly, these features made TEC-9 very popular among various marginal types. For any serious or professional shooter this gun vas of little value - it was too big and heavy to be carried comfortably, it was too unreliable when firing anything but FMJ ammunition, and the accuracy with very crude fixed sights was about marginal.

The TEC-9 design was started in Sweden, when the Interdynamic AB company of Stockholm developed a relatively simple submachine gun. Since Sweden was a poor market for such product, a subsidiary company Interdynamic was established in Miami (Florida, USA), to market Interdynamic guns in USA. As the full-automatic weapons market in USA is very restrictive, the basic submachine gun was converted in semi-automatic only variant, apparently suitable for civilian US market. This semi-automatic pistol, like its submachine gun predecessor, was a simple blowback design, firing from the open bolt. It was designated Interdynamic KG-9. But, sooner than later, US Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) found that this semiautomatic pistol can be easily converted back to full automatic, and restricted it manufacture. Interdynamic redesigned the KG-9 into ""closed bolt"" design by adding the separate striker, and designated it KG-99. About the same time (mid-1980s) the Interdynamic of USA turned into Intratec Firearms, Inc, based in the same city of Miami (Florida). Intratec initially  produced the KG-99 under the designation of  TEC-9, but about 1989 renamed it into DC-9. With the introduction of the infamous US Assault Weapons Ban in 1994 the Intratec pistols were prohibited for manufacture (but not for ownership, if made before the ban). Intratec subsequently slightly redesigned the basic design, dropping some ""assault"" features like the threaded barrel, barrel shroud, and forward pistol grip. In this ""post-ban"" version the pistol was manufactured and sold as AB-10 (AB stands for After Ban). The AB-10 pistols were sold with 10-round magazines, but still could accept both factory and aftermarket high capacity magazines from its predecessors, TEC-9 and DC-9. There were several manufacturers in US, who made copies of DC-9, such as AA Arms, which produced DC-9 look-alike AP-9 pistols. Like originals, AP-9 pistols were of cheap construction and marginal reliability.

The Interdynamics and Intratec pistols are blowback operated, semi-automatic weapons. The major difference between Interdynamic KG-9 and Intratec TEC-9/AB-10 line of pistols is that KG-9 fired from the open bolt, and had a fixed firing pin; the Intratec pistols fire from closed bolt, and have a separate firing pin and a massive striker, which interoperates with the sear. The receivers of all versions are made from steel tube (either carbon or stainless), the frames (or ""lower receivers"") are made from polymer, integral with pistol grip and magazine housing ahead of the trigger guard. The tubular receiver is hinged to the front of the frame. There is no manual safety. The open-bolt Interdynamic KG-9 pistols featured a special cut, in which the charging handle can be locked when bolt in retracted. The KG-99 and Interdynamic pistols have manual safety built into charging handle - to lock the bolt, one must push the charging handle inward. All pistols are fed from double stack, detachable box magazines; standard magazine capacity was 20 or 32 rounds for pre-ban guns, and 10 rounds for post-ban guns. After-market magazines were offered in various capacities up to 50 rounds. Permanently fixed open sights were not adjustable, and often misaligned. In the pre-ban TEC-9 and DC-9 versions these pistol accepted screw-on barrel extensions, which had purely cosmetic purposes, or silencers (which were illegal in many jurisdictions)."

I have the original main spring, but removed it due to my wanting to shoot it alittle. Fires & functions flawlessly, but really more of a collector gun, & I like to shoot mine. I got it off a buddy of mine whose dad was a WWII veteran.

I am only going to sale this pistol I do not want anything but dead presidents for it, so no trades please. I know the market is down some so I am going to put a price of $1,200.00 which is 80% book value & the pistol will easy bring 85% or better. just due to use & age.
