Pedersen of Pedersen device fame, the Remington model 51 is considered by many to be one of the best pocket pistols ever made. This is due in large part to the amount of research that went into the development of the grip shape and angle. It is said that John Pedersen tried out over 70 grip designs before choosing the one to be used on the model 51. The result is a pistol that was described by advertisers as self aiming because of its natural pointability. It also features a grip safety, a 3.5 inch barrel, fixed sights, and a serrated top strap to cut down on glare.
The example i have has minimal bluing but a nice patina, shoots better than you would expect, easy operation and great crisp tight action.

many replys thank you. heres the deal.
no lowballing meaning i will not take less than 7200 for it. with the ammo 7550 dont even ask. the only way around this is trading. as long as i come out to 7200.
as stated before ill trade for 1 only apple air computer plus the diff.
or a corvette or mini jap truck. small change items like 32 gb apple iphone 4 verizon. droid bionic verizon.. diff will have to be worked out.
i do not mean to come off sounding like a horses azz. but its my gun and i do not in any way have to or need to sell it. i just dont need it. danke schoen."

I will take multiple gun deals, single gun deals, or any combination. The majority of these guns were purchased new by myself and I simply don't use them as much as I should. All of them have been kept in a safe with a dehumidifier and have been oiled for storage. I take good care of my guns. As I said, I will take cash or trade. Just run whatever you have by me. 

-Winchester 94 AE
Great firearm and wonderful brush gun. Fired approximately 10 rounds. Great bluing and very little wear. A few knicks on the stock and nothing more. 

-Saiga 12 gauge semi auto shotgun
I purchased this gun directly from Mach One Aresenal. It was made to my specs. This gun is fully compliant. Tri-rail forearm, SGM Tactical Stock w/ cheek rest, SGM Tactical 12 round magazine, MD Arms 20 round drum, glass breaker muzzle break, pistol grip, truly a beautiful gun. It has been handled a bit but never fired. Mach One built this gun for me and it was quite pricey. This is the ultimate zombie killer or shtf gun. You won't find a nicer one. 

-Norinco SKS
Tapco Dark Earth Stock w/ rails, saw pistol grip, muzzle break, see through top rail scope mount, red dot, 2 tapco sks dark earth mags. Used but not abused. Stock is a bit rough but it is an SKS. 

-Norinco Mak 90
This is one of the finest specimens of the MAK 90 that I have ever seen. This weapon has never been fired and was produced right before the 94 ban. This is the sporter version. This is one of the finest AK's ever made and this one is unfired. Try finding another unfired MAk 90. Most have been rode hard and put up wet. This one is beautiful. Furniture is a bit worn from so many years in the safe and going through a move or two. Thumbhole stock and wooden hanguards. Comes with as many mags as I can find. 

-Remington 770
This was purchased new a few years back. I bought it to use as a brush gun but never took it out of the safe. Comes with a bushnell 3-9x40 scope. Black stock. Never fired. 

-Saiga 308
I bought this with the intentions of converting it but never got around to it. It comes with 2 SGM tactical high capacity magazines. I absolutely love Saiga's and this one is no exception. This is a quality firearm directly from Russia. 

-DPMS Target AR-15 
DPMS factory Ar-15 with 1"" stainless bull barrel. A2 stock, bi-pod, 6-24x44 scope, free floating barrel and handguard, railed gas block, top rail scope mount, medium 1"" rings. This is a sweet target AR-15. Comes with two mags (green follower and black follower). Has been fired approximately 50 rounds. Has a few knicks from being in the safe a while. This is a deadly accurate shooter and will handle whatever you throw at it. 

-Glock 22 OD green
Third Generation OD Green Glock 22. Comes with 2 factory high capacity magazines and two kci 31 round magazines. This gun has never been fired. I purchased it new and put it in the safe. 

-Sig Sauer Platinum Elite 1911
This is one of the finest 1911's on the market. This thing is absolutely beautiful. Aluminum grips, platinum slide and frame, two mags, night sights, etc.. This gun has never been fired. This is the higher end of the Sig Sauer 1911's. I purchased it new and put it in my safe. 

-Sig Sauer Pro Series 2022
This is fine 9mm pistol. Adjustable backstraps, one high capactiy mag, comes with paddle holster. This gun has never been fired. I also purchased this one new and put it in the safe. I bought it last year. It has spent most of it's life in the box. I bought it to carry occasionally but never have. 

In addition, I have large quanities of ammo as well. I will also consider gun trades for ammo. I have no need for any more ammo so I will accept cash or trades on firearms for the ammo. 

-1400+ rounds of 45acp. All brass cased Mixed lot. Mostly Aguilla and Federal. 230 Grain FMJ

-1360 rounds of 40 S&W. 500 Winchester Ranger JHP, 500 FMJ Winchester Ranger, the rest I believe is Federal FMJ. All is brass cased except for maybe one box of Tula which I ended up with somehow. 

-137 Rounds of 30-30 ammo. Assorted lot of Federal and Winchester Hunting Ammunition. All is brass cased

-130 or so rounds of 30-06. Assorted lot of Federal and Winchester. All are hunting loads and all are brass cased. 

-150 Rounds of 12 guage birdshot. All federal. Ready for quail. 

-250 Rounds 12 guage slugs. Centurion slugs that are ready for anything you need. Perfect for slug guns or to tighten up those patterns on a smooth bore. 

-250 Rounds 12 Guage 00 buck. -Rio 00 buck shot. Perfect for home defense or for the field. 

-1000 rounds of MFS 308 Steel Cased ammo. Great for FAL's, Cetme's, Saiga 308, or any other weapon. All are soft points. I used them to hunt with from time to time and they are surprisingly accurate. 

-1000 rounds of 7.62x39 Silver Bear Soft points. Perfect for your ak's or sks's. I also used these to hunt with from time to time. Accurate and not too dirty for your barrel. 

I think that is about it. All sales will be done legally and face to face. I may ship if necessary. I have photos that I can send if necessary. They are too large to attach on this website. Thanks for looking."

Serial number 372-XXXXX (post recall).  The gun is in near mint shape, with only minor external barrel wear from use.  This is standard wear for an LCP, as the barrel scrapes the slide on each shot.  No damage to the barrel rifling or any other external scuffs/scratches/dings/etc.  Basically perfect condition.

I am the second owner, and apparently the first never fired it because it looked brand new when I bought it.  I have fired just over 100 rounds through it.  I am selling because I want to get out of .380 and pick up another 9mm handgun instead.

Included with this package is the LCP itself, two 6-round magazines, a Comp-Tac 2 O'Clock IWB holster, Comp-Tac IWB spare mag holster, 13 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense (two mags +1 in the hole) and a generic pocket holster.

For a CCW weapon this is about as concealed as you can possibly get.  This is a great gun and has been cleaned thoroughly after each range trip.

Asking $425 OBO.  Will trade for a Glock 26 (I'd pay some of the difference)."

Blade Length: 18""
Overall Length: 25"" !!! 
Scabbard: Rosewood

The Barong is one of the classic short swords used by the Filipino warriors who prized it for its ability to sever an arm or leg with a single blow! While widely known throughout south east Asia, it is particularly popular to this day with the Moros of Sulu, Mindanao, and North Borneo. 

Barongs feature distinctive leaf shaped blades that are quite heavy and measure up to 18"" long by 3"" wide. They often come with elaborate handles which anchor the heavy sword in the hand and help to resist centrifugal forces when making a hard chopping or slashing stroke. 

The mirror polished blade of the Moro Barong is approximately 18"" long by 23/4"" wide and 1/4"" thick at the spine. For maximum strength and effectiveness in battle, it is forged from 1055 Carbon spring tempered steel and distal tapered to assure perfect balance. Each blade comes fully sharpened. 

The classically shaped, down-turned handle is made from exotic Rosewood, specially selected to match the scabbard in both grain and color.

I originally listed this for a friend, but now I am the owner. Springfield released this in 2005, It has never been fired or even cycled for that matter.This is a very RARE M1 Garand that is completely Mil-Spec with a match trigger, etc. Only 1944 made. Here are the details from Springfield:

SPRINGFIELD ARMORY COMMEMORATIVE M-1 RIFLE. This WWII rifle commemorates the D-Day landing at Normandy, with the frame engraved, “D-DAY NORMANDY JUNE 6, 1944”. The carved butt stock depicts American GI’s landing on the Normandy Beach. The receiver is marked, “US RIFLE/CAL 30 M1/SPRINGFIELD/ARMORY/7112291”. In a well crafted, fitted, wooden case, with dove-tail corners. The case marked on the side of the upper section, “SRINGFIELD ARMORY”, while the side of the lower section is marked, “US RIFLE CAL 30 M1”.

Each M1 Garand is serial numbered, this one is #16** of 1944 ever made. new in crate, this comes with certificate of authenticity...cleaning kit, crate, clips, manual, Army field manual, original orders to storm the beaches in Normandy, laser engraved, matching hand signed and numbered Lithograph. It is NIB Limited Edition With the matching Collectors display case. There will never be anymore of these made. This rifle is 100% and very collectable.

These rifles were released by Springfield back in 2004-2005 and there were only 1944 of these released. I open to trade offers, looking for handguns/rifles, jeep wrangler. .22, .380, 9mm, 45, 7.62x39/51 and 5.56, 1911, AR... Also open to other offers for trade.

Why some scopes lose their zeros and some don't?
Rule #1 is: In order for a scope to lose its zero, something between the reticle and the target must move.
Rule #2 is: In order to see what moved you need two reticles, each one to track the other.


The old type German scopes put the cross hair in the front focal plane. They hardly ever lost their zeros because the only thing between the reticle and the cross hair was the objective lens. The drawback was that the reticle magnified when zoomed and blocked out long-range targets. Americans put the reticle in the rear focal plane where it would not magnify. The main drawback with this was that it put about three more lenses between the reticle and the target. The American system was then three times more likely to lose its zero. The American was more convenient but the German system was more reliable.

Shepherd Rifle Scope gives you the best of both worlds with the drawbacks of neither. Sheperd uses the front focal plane location for rangefinding and bullet drop compensating circles. This gives Shepperd Scope the German dependability and, when zoomed, the circles do not block the targets but instead frame them and give you instant target engagement on any power. Then put the cross hair in the rearfocal plane (where the Americans do) in order to get the benefits of a nonmagnifying reticle. This patented Dual Reticle System lets each reticle monitor the other and thus allows for: one shot zeroing in, ""at a glance"" verification of the original zero, and visual confirmation of windage and elevation adjustments before you shoot. The Shepherd is truly the most reliable of all and the only one to tell you if something is out of zero before you shoot.

This rifle has been the most dependable rifle I have ever owned. The only reason I am selling it is to get an AR 15 with a full 16 inch barrel so I can get better bullet velocity than that of my current 11.5 inch barrel. It will function with ANY brand ammunition you feed it. I will be happy to display the flawless feeding of this rifle upon buyers request. I have taken great responsibility to keep the rifle and all of its components CLEAN. The rifle is in great condition with only 1 small scratch on the lower reciever. The only other downside is that the lever to the stock fell off sometime when I was in the woods. HOWEVER, the stock is fully functional. ORIGINAL HANDGUARD w/ vertical grip included

Just some General info on Desert eagles is there are 3 generations. the Mark 1 which came out in the 80s chambered in 357 and 44. 2nd Gen is the Mark VII 90s introducing the 50cal with a 3/8'' dove tail scope rail on top the barrel and Finally the Mark 19 XIX 2000s Featuring a 7/8'' scope rail with weaver style groves to prevent your bases from moving.

This tube was made in the early 1970s by William Meuse a noted National Park Service historian. He cast several bronze cannon and mortar tubes in the years before the Bicentenial. This type small mortar is illustrated in George Neumann's ""Collector's Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Amerian Revolution"" (page 23).

   The bore is 2 1/8 and a raquet ball fits perfectly. A water filled raquet ball will almost go into orbit when fired from this mortar. Will shoot other kinds of projectile also, I just have not done so myself.

   It has a hand chased ""GR"" under crown cypher on the top as per the originals. The solid bronze tube weights about 13.5 pounds and has a great patina. 

  The oak bed is a scaled copy of a 12 pounder mortar bed shown in John Muller's ""Treatise on Artillery"" written in 1780. It is 16 inches long and 8 inches wide. Total weight of the tube and bed is about 30 - 35 pounds. I suspect the bed should be painted. I just couldn't bear to cover the pretty oak. It has been sealed, but left unpainted and stained.
