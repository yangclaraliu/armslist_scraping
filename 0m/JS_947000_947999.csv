This is a beautiful gun that I intended to hold onto for a while, so my price is firm. As of the date of this listing, it's priced less than on Gunbroker.com and Buds (when they last had one). The pictures are from the Sig website. Let me know if you are interested and I will send you pictures of the actual gun.

Will only sell to KY residents who have a CCDW or are willing to do a transfer at an FFL dealer.

Here’s my promise to you. 
•	The gun is in like new condition and has never been fired outside the factory. 
•	All of the items that shipped from the factory are in the case including the gun, all paperwork, magazine, case and anything else described in this listing. 

If you are interested, here’s what I need from you. 
•	That you intend to buy the gun after satisfying yourself that it is as I describe.  
•	The you are willing to pay to me an amount we agree upon, and 
•	That if you do not have a CCDW, you are willing to meet me at a licensed FFL  gun dealer to do the transfer. 
•	If you have a CCDW, I will require you to sign a bill of sale that records the information on your CCDW license.

(Yes, I know that I can legally sell to someone from KY without a CCDW or without using an FFL. But, unless I know you, these are my conditions. Please don't ask me to change them.)"

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer.  Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item.  If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty.  This listing will be deleted if the gun is sold.

If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

 Was going to use this as a hunting rifle but, decided to go another route. Absolute MINT condition! I had the upper on here for sale but Im considering selling the whole setup. Im asking $1500 or would sell the complete upper for $900..... I WILL NOT SELL JUST THE LOWER!!!! DO NOT ASK!!!  And everything is best offer of course. Im flexible but please dont send ridiculous lowball offers. And, you must be a TN resident willing to sign a bill of sale..... NO exceptions!!!! Thanks for looking."

A triangle with a ""36"" inside are the only markings. I saw the new made drums going for around 189-300 dollar range so I estimate this to be about double the value of those easily.

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 9 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or blackened finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

(photo) The forend is sound with some burl wood appearance and is the proper 9 1/2"" with metal nosecap. The top of the forend has small broken area by the endcap, probably due to the figured wood not having much strength in thin area. Endcap is a gray patina. Very fine condition barrel and magazine tube have most of original blue with a few typical minor nicks and scratches. The barrel has blue wear on top between rear sight and receiver as shown. The receiver and takedown ring are a blended gray patina. Hammer has some blue color. The lever shows blended dark patina. The mechanics are crisp and lock-up is tight. The barrel has a shiny bore with no pitting or rings, probably has not had much use. The gun is sold with an old takedown padded case."

It has:
3 .223 five round mags.
Scope rings.
A 3x9 scope(not an expensive one, but a good, sturdy one)
An interchangeable barrel in .222 Remington (what the .223 was based on. A sum up of it is it shoots a bit further, and flatter than the .223, but it doesn't tumble on impact.)
2 .222 five round mags.
Seven boxes of .222 ammo.
And a laser bore sight for .223.

It also fires milsurp 5.56 quite well, and prefers the 55gr rounds as opposed to heavier.

All you need for swapping the barrels is a vice and a wrench, and somewhere around 15 minutes work to realign. Not hard, but not an on the fly thing.

A great, accurate, versatile rifle.
Has a few scratches from hunting, but has been cleaned and cared for well.

It was purchased from a gun dealer in November, and has only been test fired to ensure the mags worked properly. I have the box, and warrenty info for the AR. I have rail covers that slip over the Quad Rail that is seen attached in the picture. There are extra rubber hand guards that can be used for the entire Quad Rail that will be included. I will also include 1-30rd DPMS mag as well. I'm asking $1649.99 obo. There is iron sights that are installed, so if you decide to put optics on there you'll have back up sights. I'm not in any rush to sell and will not take any extremely low offers. FYI: There is current legislation in congress to ban all assault rifles & high capacity mags. Obama went as far as to have families of gun violence at the state of union speech to support his vote for gun bans. I'm not sure how long it will take to pass. I hope it doesn't pass. Just in case don't miss your chance to obtain a quality rifle before any ban goes into effect. I just purchased a new Sig 516, so that's the only reason why I'm selling this AR.

567,http://www.armslist.com/posts/947567,"For Sale:  2,500-Gallon Water Filtration System","Springfield, Springfield, Missouri",$ 200,"Listed On: Monday, January 28, 2013",Miscellaneous,Taurus                                                                                ,44 Magnum                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"Be prepared with this 2-Bucket water filtration system that will filter 2,500-gallons of water.  The system utilizes a gravity fed Talia Superdome filter with a 5-gallon catch reservoir.  The buckets and spigot used in the system are constructed of food-grade material and built with human consumption as the top priority.  

Talia Superdome filters have been uniquely designed to help save lives in third world countries that have the harshest and poorest water quality in the world. They have limited access to electricity or pressurized water delivery.

Talia Superdome gravity water filters are capable of filtering water from lakes, streams, rivers,ponds and virtually any dirty water into safe clean drinking water. This makes our Superdome filters the filter of choice for missionaries, disater relief organizations,emergencies,camping general preparedness and just plain simple cost effective drinking water. (less than 2 cents a gallon)

Talia Superdome filters, filter out harmful cysts, bad bacteria(Giardia,Cryptosporidum,E-Coli,Klebstella) which produce water bourne diseases capable of producing severe diarrhea leading to dehydration and in severe cases can cause death. Children are especially vulnerable with their little immune systems just starting to develop. (4,000-5,000 children die each day from water borne diseases) The elderly also struggle with compromised immune systems.

Talia Superdome filters help save lives by utilizing a fine pore ceramic water filter that is 3"" x 5"" (.3 micron) This design helps give a better flow rate and more contact time with the water for better filtration then some of the competitors out there. We utilize a stainless steel cap to eliminate leakage and breakage which has been a significant problem with some other companies.

Talia Superdome filters have been dipped in a silver solution to retard bacterial growth.

While filtering out all the harmful pathogens the Superdome filter has been filled with a the highest grade of silver impregnated granular activated coconut shell carbon on the market.

This really sets us apart where many of the competitors have no GAC in their filters let alone cocunut shell carbon. This gives these filters a 3,000 gallon capacity.

Granular activated carbon best known as (GAC) is the most powerful absorbent we have found. Granular activated carbon filters generally have a higher contaminant removal ratio. The two most important factors affecting the efficiency of activated carbon filtration are the amount of carbon in the unit and the amount of time the contaminant spends in contact with it. The longer the carbon is in contact with the water the better it is. Similarly, the lower the flow rate of the water, the more time the water is in contact with the filter. It is commonly used for removing organic constituents and residual disinfectants in water supplies. Typical surface area for activated carbon is approximately 1,000 square meters per gram (m2/gm.). The two principal mechanisms by which activated carbon remove contaminants from water are catalytic which removes residual disinfectants, and adsorption removes organics. Activated carbon filters are usually rated by the size of the particles they are able to remove, measured in microns, and generally range from 50 microns (least effective) down to 0.5 microns (Most effective). While coconut shell carbon typically costs 20% more than the others (bituminous, wood), it is generally regarded as the most effective of the three.

Activated carbon filters remove/reduce many volatile organic chemicals, pesticides and herbicides, as well as chlorine, benzene, trihalomethane compounds, radon, solvents and hundreds of other man-made chemicals found in tap water.

The two most important factors affecting the efficiency of activated carbon filtration are the amount of activated carbon in the unit and the amount of time the contaminant spends in contact with it. The more carbon the better. Particle size also affects contaminant removal rates.

ORGANIC REMOVAL
Most organics are more readily adsorbed and less soluble at a lower pH, and as the pH increases, removal decreases. It is recommended to increase the size of the carbon bed by twenty percent for every pH unit above neutral (7.0). Carbon filter capacity can be roughly estimated at 0 1 pound of organics per 1 pound of carbon at a flow rate of 1 to 2 gallons per minute per cubic foot and a bed depth of 3 feet.

RESIDUAL DISINFECTANTS REMOVAL
Activated carbon acts as a reducing agent and can remove and destroy residual disinfectants (chlorine and chloramine) through a catalytic reduction reaction. Where removal of organics by activated carbon takes minutes, removal of chlorine takes seconds. The chlorine capacity of a new activated carbon is: 1 pound of chlorine per pound of carbon at a flow rate of 3 to 5 cu. ft. and a bed depth of 3 feet. Chloramine in our city water supplies is monochloramine and is a much slower reaction.

FLOW RATE
Flow rate is going to be dependent on the number of (GAC) Granular Activated Carbon filters you have installed into your container. Generally the lower the flow rate, the more time the contaminant will have to diffuse into a pore and be adsorbed. Adsorption by activated carbon is almost always improved by a longer contact time. Lower temperatures seem to favor adsorption."

It uses a monolithic upper which is machined from a large single aluminum block instead of most AR15s which have extruded rails bolted on. The advantages are:

Improved accuracy - the rails don't contact the barrel throwing off accuracy. Also because the rail is continuous, you don't have to use cantilevered mounts when mounting long scopes, making for a more rigid optics platform. Also when mounting lasers, they stay truer to the bore axis.
A more rigid platform with fewer parts to break, work loose, or lose.

In addition to being the top of the line commercially made AR15, this is the most desirable LE6940. This LE-6940 and it is 100% NEW IN BOX. It has never been fired or even had a magazine inserted into it.

My truck died last November and I originally listed a few items to raise money to get it fixed or get another truck.  I really didn't want to sell any of them though and ended up taking the ads down.  I really need a 4x4 and found one I want but have to come up with funds before it is sold.  That said:

I have several SKS's, some Yugo 59/66s, a China Doll, Russian (that one I'll keep) as well as several bullpups in various configurations.  I also have a Nagant Sniper with certification paper for the scope, and if the price is right I would be willing to make a deal on my 1941 SVT 40 sniper.  The Nagant sniper is from 1940.  Don't let the date fool you, these are still very accurate rifles.  The SVT was basically the Russian version of the M1 Garand, and the 7.62x54r is very comparable to a .308 and these rifles are usually more accurate than the operator can shoot.  I will throw in a spam can of 7.62x54r if the deal is right.

I have to put a price in, it won't let me say 'offers' so I am just throwing a number out there and will be interested in the best offer that puts me in the truck I want.

I really don't want to sell if I don't have to so this may not be up for long.
-Update-
The truck I was looking at is gone so I don't have to rush to raise some quick cash.  I'll leave this up incase anyone has an old 4x4 pickup... we might be able to work out a trade...
The SVT is pretty much off the market because I know I can't get another sniper version with the receiver rails and notched receiver cover, at least not cheap.  So anyone interested in the SVT-40, it has to be an offer I can't refuse.

This ad will probably be taken down in a few days since I lost out on the truck and have time to save up more for a different one... unless someone has one they want to get rid of :)

**Note** this is not for all, although I will sell one or all or just a couple depending on the offer."

The Windham Weaponry SRC is an optics-ready semi-automatic carbine with a direct-gas-impingement system chambered in 5.56×45 mm NATO. The upper and lower receivers are made from forged 7075 T6 aluminum with a hardcoat black anodized finish. The upper receiver’s flat-top design features a Picatinny rail but lacks indexing marks, so care should be taken when removing and replacing optical sights in order to maintain proper zero. There is also no front sight; instead, there is an additional length of Picatinny rail atop the gas block that can be equipped with a back-up front sight or left bare to avoid obstructing lower-powered optics.

This is essentially a high capacity 1911 style pistol. Most parts are interchangeable, except this hold 14 rounds in a double stack magazine. I bought it in 1998 from Bill's here in the Twin Cities. At the time, this was Para Ordnance's hi-cap race gun. The sites were designed for competition shooting - an all-black rear blade site. I had a company in Texas add three white tritium lines to the rear site to outline the opening and painted a dot on the front so I could hit something. Really didn't use it that much. Comes with three factory Para Ordnance 14-round magazines, marked Made in Canada. That's a lot of firepower - three 14-round magazines of 45ACP. Comes with original box and paperwork.

Cartridges are screwed onto the muzzle of the pen and the cocking knob pulled back and locked into position. To fire, simply thumb the knob down and the internal spring drives the firing pin into the primer.   

THIS DOES NOT FIRE PROJECTILES/BULLETS. It is manufactured for gas cartridges only. Conversion to fire live ammo is not recommended.

This is classified as a non-lethal weapon, but not as an AOW (Any Other Weapon), thus the buyer would not need any paperwork to own the pen gun (if the gun were converted by a Class 2 manufacturer to fire live ammo, it would need to be registered with the BATFE and a $5.00 tax stamp would be required).   

Incredible collector’s item. It is becoming increasingly rare to find these. I found two at auction going for 350+ each...

Buyer must be over 18 years of age and please check local laws before considering purchase. 

Price is firm. If shipping is required, buyer must agree to pay shipping cost. I ship only to the lower 48 states."

  You are looking at a Ruger Mini 30.  I have owned this rifle for a while now and decided to thin out my collection a bit.  This rifle is adult owned, never abused, dropped, spit on or even looked at hard.  
  It comes as a package deal with the rifle (duh!), 7-10 round pro-mag magazines (very reliable), 3 Ruger FACTORY 20 round magazines, a Thermold 30 (?) round magazine as well as a Ruger 5 round hunting magazine.  Also included are about 300 +/- rounds of ammunition.  I also still have the original box.  The only modification that was ever done to the rifle was to replace the front sight ramp with an HK style sight.  I do have the original sight that will go with it as well.
   You can look but I doubt you will find a nicer Mini-30.  Add to the fact that this is a complete package, not just a rifle and my asking price is a pretty good deal. I will sell all of it for $1200.00  I also will trade up or down for .308 ammunition or M1a items.  Ask me, the worst I can do is say I am not interested.

   Now for the legals.  You must be 18, have a valid FOID card, not a bleeding heart liberal, not a convicted felon.  I will not ship this.  I live in a small town about 80-90 miles southwest of Chicago."

I picked this up 6 months ago for my wife and she isn't sure she is going to carry. I have replaced sights with night sights and added 2 additional 7 round magazines. The original sights are included in the sale as well as 3 magazines (1 original and 2 Chip McCormick).  

The handgun shows better in person as the lighting in my photos is horrible...my apologies. The piece shoots remarkably well and is a 1st gen which I have been told has better build than the current GenII handguns. I personally like them both.

I'm NOT looking to SELL, I just want another FIREARM. I'm not interested in anything other than guns so please don't waste either our time. 
The shotgun has what I think is a chrome receiver, ""red"" wood buttstock and pump. I have two barrels, both have been brushed down to the bare metal to by the person that owned it before me, both are 18 inches.
I don't hunt any kind of fowl so this gun has mostly been sitting in the corner of my bedroom as a home defense gun and I occasionally to it out and put a box or two of rounds through to make sure everything's working properly.

If you have another FIREARM you'd be interested in trading let me know.

The best two words to describe our AK 30rd magazine: ""rugged"" and ""reliable."" The reinforced composite material prevents corrosion while the heavy duty spring and anti-tilt follower ensure that every round will feed perfectly. Fits in the AK-47 using 7.62 x 39mm ammunition. When your Kalashnikov is thirsting for a magazine that can handle a beating, no questions asked, the INTRAFUSE® 30rd AK Magazine is the only logical choice. Not to mention that this magazine counts as 3 U.S. 922r compliant parts.
