 The first is a full custom knife from maker brian harrison. He's based out of michigan. It is a 1/4 thick piece of ats-34 that's heat treated, with shaped g10 polished handles with a beautiful mosiac inlay. Custom leater sheath. New it was a little  over 300 bucks. Goregous knife!

The second is a gerber shop limited edition, only made for cabelas, and is no longer produced. Its a cpm-s30v folding gerber freeman hunter with leather sheath. New, it was over 100, and its worth more now, because it was only a limited run. Very hard to find!

The third knife I have is a benchmade nitrous stryker, titanium handle with g10 overlay, automatic, and has a d2 extended tanto blade. It is not exactly a legal carry knife, but its very nice and fun to have. It was close to 150 bucks. 

All  knives are beautiful fit and finish. Anyone who's a serious collector, or lover of quality will thoroughly enjoy these."

New Heckler & Koch MR556 5.56 x 45mm Weapon System

The MR556A1 A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement of conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.

Using the HK proprietary gas piston system found on the HK416 and G36, the MR556A1 does not introduce propellant gases and carbon fouling back into the rifle's interior, making it the most reliable of any AR-type firearm.

The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. This handguard system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR rifles. The HK rail system can be installed and removed without tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR566A1 will be produced in the USA from both American and German-made components. Additionally, subassemblies like the MR556A1s upper receiver will be fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms.

Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this manufacturing process, producing a long life barrel that provides superior performance with minimal degradation of accuracy and muzzle velocity after prolonged use. Projected availability on the MR556A1 rifle and the accessory MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit is late 2010/early 2011.

The Lux has a 24.8"" barrel. walnut European-style stoch with a  curved comb. It has a tangent sight marked in 25 meter increments and adjustable for windage and elevation.
This gun is very accurate and in like new condition. Very very low round count.
Original box and manuals also comes with 2-magazines, 1-5 rounder and 1-10 rounder. There is a new trigger spring and spacer along with the directions to reduce the pull to 2 1/2 lbs.
The Weaver Scope on the gun does NOT come with the LUX it is zeroed with a laser for the gun and will be left on if you want to buy the scope for an additional $75 . The scope comes with the original box and is new and cost $269. It is perfect for the gun. If you JUST want the scope it is $150"

This Customized Kimber Stainless Carry pistol has the short 3"" barrel mounted on the full-sized frame and was built off-line in the Kimber Custom Shop by the Senior Gunsmith. It took an amazing amount of work to make this one-of-a-kind pistol. The only flaw I have found on it is that one grip has a small rub mark on it. I am just not a pistol shooter and I bought this pistol a little over a year ago only putting no more than 40 rounds through it. It is the perfect carry for someone that wants an accurate pistol with full-size grip, but a compact size.

Comes with the Caldwell fully adjustable shooting stand shown in picture with the wider bean bag insert to fit this rifle, some hornady palma ammo and some shells if you're into reloading, a hard case, $65 scope riser mounts because the stock ones only work for small scopes, 8-32x50 illuminated scope.  

I purchased the rifle last year because I lived near the NRA whittington center and wanted to do some long range target shooting with my dad.  This gun was the perfect choice.  It's incredibly accurate.  I'm a complete amateur (before this the only rifle I owned was a .17hmr) and I was able to get 8"" groups at 600 yards as long as the wind wasn't too strong.  I'm sure even a moderately skilled marksman could do even better.   

Gun has been fired 70-90 times and cleaned after every outing.  I'm moving back to Colorado over memorial day weekend so it's only for sale until Thursday the 24th.

Looking to see whats out there in trade for my stainless steel model 686. The revolver is in great condition and the timing is still perfect. This is a pre-lock model so you wont have to worry about accidental hang-ups in a self-defense situation. There is a small ding on the rear sight blade that has been present since time immemorial but certainly doesnt affect the accuracy of the weapon. 30 rounds of blazer 357 magnum ammunition would go with the trade-(but dont forget that 38 special can also be chambered).
