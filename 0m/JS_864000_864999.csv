I was going to build this into (my) ultimate 7.62 (.308) AR, but now planning a move to CA, where what I wanted to build with it is verboten. The easiest way to build this is with a Hogan or POF piston upper and buffer. Other 308 AR DI or piston uppers will require some skilled fitment, but can be done.

Rossi shotguns use the timeless single shot break open breech design updated with the most modern safety features. These shotguns include a spur hammer, transfer bar safety action and an integral linkage system that prevents the action from opening or closing when the hammer is cocked.

Each is a reliable, lightweight gun easily carried throughout an entire day in the field. Wide, powerful ejectors eliminate lost time removing spent hulls or unfired shells without compromising safety.

The AR15 lower is an R Guns billet aluminum lower receiver that is built with a Bushmaster lower parts kit and mil-spec stock/buffer assembly.  The upper is an Olympic Arms A2 style upper (fixed carry handle) that comes with built in rear iron sight.  Gas system and grips are Rifle length, barrel length is 20"" .  At this time, I am selling this WITHOUT the bolt carrier group. The 7.62x39 round is the same round as the AK47 and currently is pretty easily found and much cheaper than 5.56/.223 ammo.  The good part about this rifle is that it is built on an AR15 lower receiver NOT an AR10 (.308).  So you get the power of the 7.62 round, but you can get yourself different uppers ie: .300 Black Out, 5.56/.223, 9MM etc etc, then you can simply pull the pins and swap out the upper.

The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2"" to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire"

Appears to be in good shape overall, with a few knicks here and there.  Finish on grenade launcher mount is stripped, though I've got it tapped and ready for removal if you'd like to attach a muzzle break.  

Tek sights make this a SWEET shooter; adds ~11"" of sight picture, makes it much easier to reach out and touch a target at 100+ yrds.  Easily removable for restoration to stock sights (though from a shooting standpoint I don't see a good reason to do so).  

Rifling is damn near perfect, and overall internals seem to be in very good shape.  I've shot ~200 rds with constant cleanings, and previous owner seems to have taken great care of her as well.  Detail strips on my end show near-mint internals.

Has spring-loaded firing pin to avoid slamfires, and have had some cleanup work on the trigger so she's as close to ""glass rod"" as you're going to find in an SKS.

Overall, great gun in great shape, and a SWEET shooter."

Bought new in 2001 - less than 1000 rds through it.
Rifle built in 2001 using the original trigger groups, not the cheap tapco groups in later imports.
Had a gunsmith deburr some internals to smooth out and lighten the trigger pull - 
Now a very nice (light) trigger that allows bump firing, or burst firing from the shoulder if you wish.

Comes with 5 thirty round magazines and speed loader. (4 steel, 1 poly, all with bolt hold open device - very rare in AK Mags)

 - Romanian Red Bakelite Pistol grip and stock black pistol grip
 - Muzzle Break - not yet installed
 - Chrome lined barrel
 - PU scope mount ready for optics

The SAR is a true AKM clone.  Unlike the Wasr which is a sporter designed to take single stack magazines and them drilled our to fit larger mags, the SAR is built to take hi cap mags and holds the mags in place with dimples on the receiver like an AKM.  This means the SAR will accept any mag and any Ammo.   The SAR also contains the ""Third Pin"" in the trigger group assembly so it is ready to convert to a full auto trigger group if you wish to do that in the future.
 - The Wasr is a designed sporter adapted to become an assault style weapon
 - The SAR is a military full auto adapted to semi auto civilian use

Really nice rifle - just have nowhere to shoot it anymore."

Please, serious inquiries only.

So as you may have heard....those living in New York State have 1 year to sell their 11+ round magazines before they become illegal to possess. Bullshit...I know, but since I am law-abiding...here they are:

I have 5 (30 round) Taiwanese ""type 65"" Pre-ban AR-15/M-16 magazines (some in packages, some not)
I also have European surplus magazines for the AK-47 (30 round) and also some 20 round Ak-47 magazines
All of these magazines were legally purchased from keepshooting.com within 1 year ago, and the ones that are packaged have been stored in a box ever since.

I also have an 8-round Check-mate (They contract most of the magazines today for companies like Colt) magazine that will fit any commander or full size 1911.

Please feel free to make an offer on any individual magazine or any combination of the magazines.

Springfield Armory says,

""The XD's legendary Point and Shoot Ergonomics combines natural pointability with a compact, contoured polymer grip, creating an instrument that feels more like a natural extension of your body than an object in your hand. The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch that there is a round in the chamber. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied. A grip safety allows the XD to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. 4-inch barrel calibered for 9MM Luger ammunition.""

With its origins and limited service with Special Ops US forces in Viet Nam and other venues, this one is not an original Ingram/MAC Pistol, but it is identical to the closed-bolt variant that was on the civilian market in the 1980s, the M-10A1. This is a Vulcan V-10 .45 ACP Pistol, manufactured in Minnesota, and it fires from the closed bolt and is thoroughly semi-automatic. It is thoroughly steel, too, as one can tell by simply holding it. It is a very reliable, well made and eminently serviceable descendant of its MAC-10 ancestor. This pistol comes with one 30-round magazine in its factory Doskocil Case.
