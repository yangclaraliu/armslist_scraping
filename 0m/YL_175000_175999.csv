It is in great shape and fires perfectly although I haven't fired it much because it is a collectible.  I run my 38s thru my run of the mill (but love it still) model 10. The only thing not original are the grips. Serial number v57xxxx. A fairly low number places circa 1942-43 I believe. The ending serial is about v79xxxx and starting v39xxxx I've been told. Only selling because if our economy and need the cash. Most I've seen sell in the $500 range but I've priced for quick sale.  Stamped U.S. Property. Original finish is awesome for a 70+yr old veteran. Fi.ding and changing grips will increase value but I don't have the time to locate them my daughter starts school thurs and we like to eat a couple times a day. I've been looking for work for over a year and have found some but can't start till the end of the month. Call or text Tony at REDACTED. I prefer text because my ph has poor reception at home but texts go du no prob. If I don't answer please leave a message and I will call you right back. Please no ridiculous offers. If you know the revolver you know my asking price is more than fair. I just looked at one that was not close to the condition of this one and the dealer was asking over $500. You will be helping my family by purchasing this beautiful firearm and add a nice piece to your collection.

This rifle is very nice, but has been messed with by a previous owner. They appear to have polished the bolt (it should be blued) and put the rifle in an Israeli made stock. For whatever reason they also restamped the bolt handle with the receiver's serial number and stamped this number under the buttplate as well. The fake serial number under the buttplate has already been defaced by me so no one can claim it matches the stock. No sure why the owner would have done this in the first place, since post-war Czech K98's aren't worth as much as wartime matching German examples, but whatever, ha!

The selling point of this rifle is the bore. It is in 100% beautiful condition! I have shot it many times and get very good groups with it at 100 yards. You really have to see it to believe it!

Because of the Israeli stock on this rifle I am selling it strictly as a shooter. Finding a replacement stock won't be difficult if it bothers you like it does me, ha!

I am asking $300 for it, which is a pretty reasonable price since Russian Capture K98's are selling in the $400+ range these days. Send me a PM is interested or if you'd like other pictures.

If this doesn't sell this week I am going to take it with me to the Clarence Gun Show on Saturday morning (August 13th) and will likely be there all day until it sells.

A scaled down version of the famous Colt Single Action Army, this 6-shot, single action Colt Frontier Scout has a 5” barrel, and is chambered for .22 Magnum. For the knowledgeable Colt Collector,  this was not one of the dual-cylinder (.22LR-.22Mag) pistols, it was only chambered for .22 Magnum, and it is marked as such on the left side of the barrel. The pistol has a flat blue factory finish. The black plastic hard rubber checkered grips with the Rampant Colt emblem look exactly like those on a large caliber Colt Single Action, and they are in really nice condition. The bore is shiny with good rifling, and trigger pull is smooth. These little Colt revolvers are becoming pretty collectible, and with it’s .22 Magnum chambering, the gun would also be a great pistol for plinking, hunting, and even defense use. No box."

I have had it for about three years. It is in excellent shape and works very well. I have it turned on and chilled down, ready for a buyer to inspect. It was set up to dispense home brew and only needs a 5 dollar male hose connector to convert it back to accepting commercial sold kegs of beer.  It will hold up to a 1/2 keg of beer or the equivalent to 7 cases of beer. This would be an excellent addition to any game room, bachelor house, and a must have for any man cave.  Also a great addition to parties such as, Halloween, Birthdays, Christmas, New Years, Saint Patrick's day etc. I hate to get rid of it because it's such a cool ""guy toy"" but I don't drink enough beer or hold enough parties any longer to justify keeping it, and I don't want to watch it rot away in my garage. I still have the manual and the parts (plastic and rubber plugs) to convert it into a regularly functioning fridge as well. The current model of this ""Chill'nTap"" ( Danby's trademark name for the kegorator) ranges from $650-$750(BEFORE TAX). Below, I have included links because there are smaller versions that go for 500-600 and someone will inevitably email me and say they can buy it for 500 new, not so..That would be the smaller version.( and that is before tax and/or shipping).

note: the photos below are stock from Apple's web site. Since I
haven't even opened the shipping boxes yet, I obviously can't take
photos of the actual products for sale here.

 



 




UPDATE: I've already gotten some ridiculously low offers. Cash price of $400 price is firm.  But since this is Armslist.com , I am open to trades.
I'm not selling this because I need the money, although I'd obviously like to recover my cost, minus $10 (which is less than the re-stocking fee if I returned it).
If I can't sell it here, it's going to be somebody's Christmas present later this year.

UPDATE: The availability of 1st Generation iPads from Apple changes from day to day. They currently do not have this model in stock, although they probably will within a week or two. 

UPDATE: Local sales, face-to-face, in Colorado only. If you need it shipped, it would simply be cheaper to order one directly from Apple than pay me to ship mine. I've had scammers ask me to ship this to places like California, England, Uganda, etc."

This shotgun has some corrosion/pitting here and there (see pics). The rear sight is broken, but could be replaced.. I acquired it in its current condition on a trade. It's no looker. However, this gun functions flawlessly. I have put a few dozen rounds through it with absolutely no problems.

$125 OBO. Will meet face to face in central Indiana. I am currently out of town (wife is military) so I will have a family member or friend meet to make the sale. Will consider a trade for a handgun of any type or caliber or an old smooth-bore shotgun.

I took my AR15 to a gun shop and he valued my AR15 around 450 to 500 dollars. I do not need an AR15 so that is why I am wanting to trade. I have a full size SR9 so I have no need for the full size variant. I have to have a compact gun that I can conceal when I want/need to do it. 
I want the gun to be in pretty good shape and have been properly maintained. Holster wear is not that big of a deal because I'm not throwing it in the safe, I'll be carrying it. My full size SR9 is stainless so if you have a black SR9c that'd be cool. If you have an Axis you want to trade some duty wear is not a problem.
So details on my AR15. It is has a Colt upper receiver and it looks like a Colt front site but the dealer said he did not believe the barrel was a Colt. The lower receiver is a complete one made by Cavalry Arms and is a CAV-15 I think. It fires and is pretty fun to shoot.
I am comfortable with driving to the Columbus  area for a good trade. I can go to a different city but that is about as far north as I want to travel. I can see Kentucky from where I live so I am as far south as Indiana gets!

I have for sale, a hardly shot (less than 500 rounds) Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22.

The rifle was $449 new, plus $20 each for the additional magazines.

This is the AR-15 style 22lr that shoots 25 rounds.  This gun is in fantastic condition, I have never had any issues with it.  

It comes in the original box.  I am looking for the paperwork that came with it but at the time of this posting I could not locate it.  If I find it by the time you purchase the rifle, I will of course include it.

Normally this rifle comes from the store with 1 magazine, but as you can see in the picture the rifle comes with 3 magazines.  Trust me, with this rifle you can never have enough magazines!!!!

This gun was bought locally in Fuquay and has been in my possession for about 3 months.  

It comes bone stock, except the 2 additional magazines which cost around $25 per depending on who you buy from.

I took this gun out last week and it fired flawlessly.  Once you load the magazines properly (Ill show you) you will have no problems.  I havent had a FTE or FTF since the first day, and those were my fault..

I just cleaned and oiled this gun 5 minutes before posting this, so it is ready to rock.  

I will also throw in a couple hundred rounds of 22 ammo, which is $18 for 500 rounds. 

The only reason I am selling this gun is I want to buy a true zombie killer, a AR-15.

The gun is not sighted in.  I had a scope on it and just put the stock sites on for the purpose of selling.

There are a couple of rules for buying that are not negotiable.

They are:

You must be a resident of Wake County, NC, and you must provide me with your valid drivers license.  
You must have either a pistol permit or concealed pistol permit.  This is a absolute must, no exceptions.  I must be certain you are authorized to buy a rifle in North Carolina.
You must be willing to sign a bill of sale which acknowledges you purchasing the rifle from me.
You must pay in cash.  Sorry, cash is king!!!!

You can definitely make the trip out to Holly Springs to take a look at it.  

The picture is recent, just took it after I cleaned it.

This is a video of the gun being shot last weekend by my buddy.  This is the rifle you are purchasing.  Sorry, he isnt a great shot!!!!!!

The adjustment works well and the lenses are clear. There are two very small ""spots"" at the 12 o'clock position when looking through the scope and the horizontal crosshair on the reticle has a slight wavyness to it.

Up for sale is my Beretta 1200FP Semi Auto Tactical Shotgun.

I bought this to run 3 gun matches but time has not allowed me to do so. 
This thing is perfect. 95% condition or better. (I'm a tough critic) 
6+1+1 capacity in 2 3/4 and 5+1+1 for 3""Mags. More than enough for anything that goes bump in the night! 
Being an inertia operated gun it fires unbelievably fast. It's the fastest i've shot. If you aren't familiar with these they are Identical to the Benelli M1. only difference in a 1200FP and 1201FP is the but plate. The 1201 has an ugly white spacer in front of the recoil pad.

I sure I'll regret selling this one, especially at the price. It's a DEAL at $475. They are going on gunbroker for $500-600 + Shipping and FFL Fees.

I'm listing a few other guns as well. If somehow they sell first I reserve the right to tuck this one back in my safe! ;)

Synthetic with a decent Bushnell 3-9x scope. Tt has a home brew camo pattern that shows some wear. not the best but certainly gets the job done. Consider this a hunting rifle not a safe queen.

Smooth Action, Bolt Locks up Tight, shoots great. 20 or 22 inch barrel i can't remember.
I don't know why but this thing has an awesome trigger. Light enough to surprise everyone I've ever let shoot it. Lighter than my 700 and other 710!

Included is 2 boxes (40 rds) of ammo. Have you priced the stuff lately? whew...

If you want a good reliable hunting rifle for the upcoming season this is a great one. 

If you have a disparaging comment about the 710 please keep it to yourself. Forums are full of people who have never owned or fired one but have an opinion about them. These are a bargain and only hated on by people who own $800-$1000 rifles and can't stand to be out shot and out hunted but guys with $350-$400 rifles. I've had much more expensive rifles that have enjoyed shooting less.
