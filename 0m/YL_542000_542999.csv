This is just the caliper barrel and stock wood change kit, no receiver or other parts but what you see in photos.

Italian's converted M1 30-06's in to 7.672 NATO cartridge guns. They did this by shortening the barrels 1/2"" and re-chambered for 7.62. They also shortened the stock by an equal amount. The barrel is not marked ""short chamber"" so a gunsmith will be able to install the barrel for you. Barrel is HRA 10-54 with hardly any wear. Op rod is also shorter by 1/2"" and is marked SA.

Wood is new walnut includes all three new pieces. Stock is marked ""PB"" for Pietro Beretta. 

I used one of these on a receiver from CMP and it head spaced within spec on barrel install. 

Will not separate parts.

Might consider trades guns of equal value. Entertain shotguns"

Used HK P2000 SK chambered in .40S&W. Great gun but I need money for another project. You can see by the pictures that this is in phenomenal condition. Night-sights, ambidextrous slide catch, ambidextrous mag release, fit, and finish are all great. Has approximately 400 rounds on it and not one malfunction. Extremely concealable, even in shorts and a t-shirt. Original case and two magazines included. Suggested retail new: $941. More pictures on request.

The P2000 SK model is a small ""sub-compact"" version of the P2000. American versions of the P2000 SK will accept the longer USP Compact magazines which provide higher capacities; up to 12 rounds.

This has the Law Enforcement Modification(LEM) package. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 - 8.5 pounds of pressure. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 lbs.  Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing.

The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter's hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.

A set of abbreviated ""industry standard"" mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines.

It’s like having several Benelli shotguns in one. There’s even a barrel with rifle sights for home defense and a SuperNova Tactical fitted with a ghost-ring rear sight and pistol grip.
At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the new SuperNova super-light, super-strong and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova isn’t just tough on the outside. With its dual-action bars and two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel, the SuperNova is rock solid to the core."

Features include an RPK style receiver, which is thicker than a standard Ak receiver ensuring a rock solid, long lasting rifle. The gun has wood stocks and an integral weaver style rail mounted on top of the receiver. The rifle comes with two 30 round magazines and the box it came in. I want an SGL AK , so I can't keep two AK's.  Feels like a really well made AK variant and would make an excellent rifle. I paid $729 with tax but I will let it go for a great price.

This same exact pistol was featured on the show American Guns a few weeks ago. Very cool gun.  The SS198 Green tip ammo is getting really hard to find. (actually the pistol itself is getting hard to buy now too)  I also have a few extra cases of the green tip ammo, if you wanna buy some extra to keep on hand.  I have a couple dozen boxes of the blue tip as well, that I would sell for $39 a box 

If you dont want the extra 30 round magazine, subtract $50. If you dont want the ammo, subtract $495. I've been seeing the green tip ss198 stuff, sell for over $50 a box on other gun sites.

Don't confuse this with a run of the mill off the shelf AR-15/M4. It is a name brand competition quality piece. The guy I bought it from used it is three gun matches. It has had some trigger work done. I am not sure what has been done but it is much nicer than the government issued M4's I use at work.

It was purchased new in May, 2011 and has been used to help a few friends get into shooting before I let them use bigger toys.  It has not been dragged through the woods and is still in great shape.  I moved and don't get to use it nearly as much as I'd like (last time I shot it was earlier this summer).  I finally upgraded the mount to the one pictured to keep the Simmons 3x9x32 scope from walking off the back of the dovetails and also have a speedloader that lets you pre-load tubes of .22 while sitting on the couch to save time at the range.  It has a Butler Creek flip up cover for the rear, never could find one for the front, but that will go as well.  This rifle shoots great with Federal and Winchester bulk, but doesn't like Remington for whatever reason.  My favorite game is knocking over 12ga hulls at 50 yards, and this gun can do it without issue.

Selling to get some new glass for a hunting rifle, so if you have something for trade in which I might be interested, feel free to ask.  I could put some cash in on my end to even out.  Looking for Leupold, Nikon, Vortex, etc, not BSA, Burris, and the like.

This AR started out as my KISS rifle, standard furniture, carry-handle rear sight, the works. Then as usual, I started tinkering with it, haha! I'm fairly certain my GF is gonna kill me someday. Basically, it became a fancier version of my trunk-gun. So here it is, in it's current configuration. Oh, she has roughly 600rds down the pipe.

All mil-spec, of course. PSA upper receiver with 1:7 twist chrome lined MP/HP barrel, 16"" M4 profile. Mega forged lower, standard combat trigger group. Magpul grip, stock, trigger guard, AFG1, flip-up rear MBUS. Also from Magpul is the sling system. ASAP ambi single-point plate, front rail mount point, and the MS2 sling. Great set-up, fast transition from single-point to 2-point, easy adjustment. Pull thumb-loop down to loosen, up to tighten.

Ditched the A2 FSB for a freefloat set-up. Yankee Hill lo-pro gas block, barrel properly dimpled under the set-screws. One piece lightweight extended freefloating YHM quad-rails w/ ported endcap. Fitted with TangoDown SCAR rail panels, removable fixed front sight with a KNS Precision V-notch sight post, & Streamlight PT LED light.

Heart of any AR is the bolt carrier group... Bravo Company auto-spec BCG. That's a no-brainer. Also from BCM is an H-buffer, and a Mod4 Gunfighter charging handle.

Optic is the tough-as-nails Aimpoint CompM2 red-dot, with KillFlash. 'Nuff sed. You get what you pay for with optics, and Aimpoint has earned their reputation. The mount is great, remove and replace it as much as you want, never loses it's zero. Twist the mount-knob till it clicks 3 times, done.

One really nice thing about this AR, it's not picky about ammo. I've fed it everything from 75gr Hornaday T.A.P. to the el-cheapo Tula steel case crap. Just gobbles it up.  :)


$1,750 or $1,300 without the Aimpoint.

Comes with two 30rd Magpul P-mags, a bottle of  SLiP EWL, and a padded soft carry-case.


Email me through here, and we'll exchange numbers at that point.

These guns were originally made in .22 hornet, and .410 gauge and stored in US Airforce Bombers.  They were kept in the pilot's ejection seat for survival in the case the pilot needs to eject.  Hence the common name of survival rifles.  The original guns were made with a 16"" barrel and so were not legal to the general public.  Springfield started making these guns I believe in the late 80's or earily 90's.  They stoped making them in 2004 and they not are becoming harder to find.  In all honesty these guns are not practical (the biggest reason this gun has been used so little).  They are novelty guns and or collector items!  Fun for a while, good to keep in the truck, or take camping, hiking, etc.  Gun folds in half or can be compleatly taken down with one quick pin removel.  It will fit in most back packs!

The Fusil Automatique Léger (""Light Automatic Rifle"") or FAL is a battle rifle produced by the Belgian armaments manufacturer Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN). During the Cold War it was adopted by many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, with the notable exception of the United States. It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by over 90 countries. The FAL is predominantly chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO round, and because of its prevalence and widespread use among the armed forces of many NATO countries during the Cold War it was nicknamed ""The right arm of the Free World""

Its ammo picky likes Mini Mags but not cheap bulk ammo. I have not tried a large variety to see what it shoots best. The cheap stuff will have FTF or FTE issues.

There are a few fixs out there but I have not had time to play with it. I have read most are to do with the mags. This rifle is very accurate and thats a big plus for it.
I want a Bolt Action .22 so I am selling this or will trade it for one. I live in Walterboro and do not get out of town very often. Face to Face Transaction only.
Comes with Scope Rail installed and 3 mags.

I really like the double standards that we have on the free web sights that only the tabe top dealers have for others and how if a person has a item for sale some others feel the need to bash it then next week the same person bashing the item will have the same thing listed for more, Check it out and you will see what I am talking about, Some people even like to call others a table top dealer or a clown in a post because they know just what that is because the shoes will fit them well!

The two Smith & Wesson magazines have the original wrapper, and have oil on them (from being stored in their wrappers), hence the coloration in the photo.
If you loaded the magazines the night before going to the shooting range, say while watching TV, you could spend your time at the shooting range actually shooting 2 boxes of ammo (100 rounds), instead of re-loading magazines.

The gun for sale here is a German-made Walther P99, not the American-made copy Smith & Wesson SW99 copy.

Additional 15-round magazines are available from CDNN for about $35 each (S&W / Magnum Research) and from Cheaper Than Dirt for about $45 each (Walther)

CDNN is a great company that I've been doing business with for over 15 years, and is always the first place I look for when I need magazines.

Date code on frame is KI, meaning this gun was manufactured in 1998, about a year or two after the P99 was first introduced.

This has the ""AS"" (anti-stress) trigger, although I don't think it was called that at the time.  It has a knob on the slide to de-cock the internal striker, so the first shot is double-action, with subsequent shots being single-action.  If you're familiar with the classic SIG pistols (P22x series), then you have an idea of how this works; except that the P99 has an internal-striker instead of an external-hammer.


-- caveats --

This is one of the early Walther P99s, with a proprietary accessory rail.  Lights and lasers designed for the standard [M-1913 ""Picatinny"" rail will not fit.  I don't know if lights for the Walther rail are available. 

But it doesn't matter, because the previous owner (a co-worker of mine) removed material from the frame with a Dremel tool so he could fit some cheap Airsoft laser on the gun, but he did not do a very good job.  The damage does not affect functioning of the gun, and is in a small area, but it is noticeable.  Some fine-grit sandpaper and patience may remove the tool marks.  'Tis a pity, because in my opinion the first-generation P99 was the most aesthetically pleasing version of the P99.





Also, a lot of users reported that the ""ski hump"" or ""ski jump"" in the trigger guard pinched their fingers.  While I haven't had this problem, the magazine release lever does rub on my finger when firing, causing discomfort.  Some fine-grit sandpaper and some patience may fix this problem.  Perhaps having smaller fingers than I do -- I have big hands -- may also help.  Personally, I believe a lot of people who experienced discomfort with their trigger finger mis-diagnosed the cause. 




That being said, if I wasn't so heavily invested in Glock -- [i]i.e.[/i], I already have sunken costs in holsters for my Glock, a back-up Glock for my Glock, lots of Glock magazines, and time spent learning to shoot the Glock over the past 20+ years -- this would probably be my carry gun (if I could mitigate the problem with my finger rubbing against the magazine release lever).  

The ergonomics of the Walther P99 are [i]much[/i] better than Glock's, and I've really come to appreciate why some people like the double-action/de-docker SIG-like trigger mechanism.

In 2004, Walther re-designed the P99.  They replaced the proprietary rail with a standard M-1913 ""Picatinny"" rail, and removed the ""ski hump"" from the trigger guard in response to user complaints.

At 8 minutes 30 seconds into the video, he pulls the trigger to de-cock the striker for disassembly.
Unlike a Glock, it is not necessary to pull the trigger to disassemble a P99.
Instead, he could have used the P99's de-cocker to de-cock the striker before taking the gun apart.
The P99 ranks with the Beretta 92 as the easiest semi-auto to disassemble.
