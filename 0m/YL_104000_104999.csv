223 Remington Full Length Die SET. Custom Grade New Dimension Dies. This sell for $55 retail.
    I'm selling this cheap because the sizer had a stuck case live round. I don't want to mess with it so i just bought a new one. Everything is in excellent shape except for the stuck live round on the sizer. Don't ask me how it happened. I know i'm stupid!.

Some of the pictures look as if there are a bunch of scratches on the barrel.  This is not the case.  This gun has almost no blemishes.  One would have a hard time telling it from a new one.  It comes with the original wood grips that have one tiny tiny chip on the bottom, and no scratches.  And a New pair of Hogue rubber Mono-grips.

The single action trigger pull has absolutely no creep or take-up and  is as good as some high-end 1911 pistols.  The double action pull is as good as any other factory pull.

No original box or papers, but I will include a Midway USA pistol bag.

The last year of production of this gun 40K were made 30K were police issued in 9mm,  the rest went to the Army.  The large majority of the Army pistols were chambered in the .30 cal.    This is an Army issued model in the 9mm. It does not have the police stamping on the sides,  nor does it have the police seer on it.  All numbers match on the item and it does have several of the Nazi/ Reich stamps on it as well.  The only part of the gun that is not original is the Magazine  it dates to 1938 or 1939, this really does not effect the value of the gun itself.  
I had it looked at by several sources and it  values from $800-$1000 I took it a couple of weeks ago to the Medina gun show and talked to a several of the Luger guys there to confirm everything about it.   It is in great shape according to the dozen or so guys that looked at the item and they all  agreed that the price of $800 would be on the low end of the spectrum for the gun.  I feel the amount i'm asking for is more then fair.  do your research and you'll agree.

I'm looking to sell the item more then trade it!

I have no real desire to make a trade.  At this point i'm just not that interested in this gun.   If your looking to trade for this i'm looking at getting several items for it,  I like .22 pistols and  rugers.  
Pistols and semi auto's. chambered in 9mm,  .38  .380, 357 and 44.

 I'm not interested in .40 or .45 pistols,  one less round I would need to buy.  I have no desire to buy to trade for your personal AR creation either.

Simple pump shotguns work as well.  As well as possibly .22 rifles or 9mm rifles as well.


As the guy stated in an earlier post.  I have a price see the amount above.  I am aware of the items value.  I've looked at auctions,  I've had it looked at by all most a dozen people to confirm the value of the guy.  What i'm asking for is more then a fair price.  You can't buy a cheap beat-up Luger for under $600 these days."

Heres the deal. I bought this private party about 3 months ago. The owner had 100 rounds thru it and I have put 350 thru it. I really don't have any reason to get rid of it other than it don't shoot well for me. Have a few other other Glocks and love them, this one just don't fit my hand. Thinks it's due to the shorter grip. I have carried it a few times and it really conceals nice due to the slim grip. So I thought I'd post it and see what comes along.

What I am interested in:
H&K USP 45c or Kimber Pro Carry. I know I probally need to add cash to these but that is fine, we can work out what's worth what. I really don't need the money, but if the right cash offer comes along that may work.

I have a Winchester Model 94 AE (angle eject) and am the original owner.  I never mounted a scope on it, but the angle eject feature allows for it.  It's chambered in 30-30 and has roughly 2 boxes of rounds put through it (about 40 rounds total).  There is absolutely nothing to tell you about either cosmetically or mechanically.  As you know, these guns are no longer made and finding one that hasn't been beaten up is rare.  I'll provide a serial number to interested buyers, but by my estimation it was made some time around 1994.  The wife is making me clean out the gun cabinet after a recent AR purchase, so I'm trying to find a good home for this one.  It's been hunting once, and I took 3 hogs with it using open sights!  I'm asking $450, but would listen to reasonable offers.  I'm not interested in trades.  Obviously, this one will go up in value.  Call me at REDACTED or email at REDACTED.  Thanks for looking, Scott"

However, I don't want to just sell someone a rifle. I want to help someone who wants to be prepared. If you have been looking into buying a firearm because the future looks uncertain, then please take a moment to consider this package.

This is an AK74 in 5.45x39, built on a bulgarian parts kit by IAC. It has wooden furniture, a CHROME LINED BARREL, as well as chrome lined gas tube and muzzle device, and an AK recoil buffer installed. 
The 5.45 is an excellent defensive cartridge, known in the middle east as the ""poison bullet"" for its ability to maim. It is cheap to shoot, and has extremely low recoil. Its ballistics mimic that of the american 5.56. 
It is a tack driver as well, capable of 2 MOA with irons. The scope mount on the side of the receiver could be put to very good use with a decent piece of glass.

This package includes the following
- AK74 rifle
- (9) 30rd bulgarian double circle 21 magazines
- (1) unopened crate of 5.45 ammuntion (2,160rds)
- (4) boxes of 5.45 ammuntion (120rds)
- (1) ChiCom 3 cell chest rig
- (1) rifle carrying case

I am losing 200 dollars at this price, but it is acceptable to me, if it goes to someone who needs it, and who will use it. 900 is a good price, and I cannot go any lower, and will only sell as a package.

I will consider trades for Springfield M1A rifles, or good 47 pattern AK's(I like underfolders or factory sidefolders) or RPK's. Let me know what you have, and we can discuss it. I am open to negotiate a little. 

Thank you, and god bless."

***TOP scope in the pic, others are sold*** Weaver VX-9 Micro-Trac scope (3x9x40) - Has the range finding target turret built in. Pretty rare to find one like this at all. This one does need to be re-furbished. Overall really nice shape and glass excellent but O-Rings need replaced. I purchased with the intent of sending to Iron Sights in Tulsa to be re-done. Iron Sites does all of the old Weaver and Redfield work. Never got around to sending it off. They charge $90 to do a re-furbish job. Make a great scope to put on a vintage rifle. Re-furbished this scope is easily worth $250. Take $75 for it or trade for a .22 rifle."

Shows very minor normal wear and tear from being the knockaround gun for a few decades, original bakelite grips are in very good shape, works DA or SA flawlessly, no ejection issues as long as you clean it once every 5 or 6 years, and the bore is great. 

Just a nice old tin can shooter, these were incredibly well built, reliable ""kit gun"" revolvers, and it is an accurate little shooter as well, just right for the console of the truck, tackle box, or to just take for a walk in the woods. 9 rounds of a good hot .22 wouldn't be the end of the world as far as a nightstand gun, too.

 Hi All,

  This is an accurate Mini 30. I have had it cryo-treated and it does not string shots. I have not fired it much, honestly, less than 100 rounds. The entire action, bolt, firing pin, slide and barrel were cryo treated. ALL springs were removed for the process...even the extracter plunger spring! This is as close to new as you will find and more than $200 less than I paid. Notice, the price on these has been creeping up..as is everything. What you see is what you get...minus ammo.
