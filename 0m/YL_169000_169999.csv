The Cibola (pronounced see-bow-lah) combines H.O.T. circuitry with turn-on-and-go simplicity. It is designed for the treasure hunter that does not want to bother with too many controls. The Cibola is named after one of the fabled seven cities of gold that the conquistadors were searching after and will simplify the search for any treasures to be found.

The ease of use for the Cibola makes it the perfect detector for both the metal detecting novice as well as the treasure hunter that has been around for a while.

Field & Stream Best of the Best 2010
Over the years our Pendleton Hunters have become enormously popular, and while we think they are reasonably priced, many have asked us for a more affordable Pendleton that will accommodate just about anyone's budget.

So we got together with Lloyd and designed a new knife we call the Pendleton Lite Hunter. In appearance it strongly resembles the rest of the family with a drop point blade, modest guard, hollowed bolster area and a flared butt to aid retention. The only major changes were the adoption of more affordable 4116 Krupp steel and the use of polypropylene instead of Kraton for the handle.

In our testing it got straight A's in the field as it is equally adept at field dressing and skinning, held a decent edge, was easy to sharpen, and proved to be tough as nails.

If you're looking for a very affordable hunting/utility knife that comes with a good, pouch-style sheath and delivers more than your money's worth in performance and value look no further than the Pendleton Lite.

The Cold Steel Canadian Belt Knife takes inspiration from a 1950's classic. It has all the features that made the original an award-winning, international favorite. Our more contemporary version is made out of 4116 Krupp Stainless steel and hollow ground to a razor edge. It will glide through just about any material because its elliptical profile is very efficient at reducing cutting drag. The Polypropylene handle is equally efficient, fitting snugly in virtually any hand. It's slightly offset in relation to the blade to keep one's fingers safely out of the way. Light and tough enough to endure hard knocks, it will never break or fall apart in the way a traditional wood handle is prone to do. This 2-ounce blade comes complete with a pouch style black Cordura sheath. It's light, slim and compact enough to carry on your belt or slung from a cord around your neck day in and day out. Specifications: - Weight: 2.2 oz. - Blade Thickness: 2.5mm - Blade Length: 4"" - Handle: 4 1/2"" long. High Impact Polypropylene - Steel: 4116 Krupp Stainless - Overall Length: 8 1/2"" - Sheath: Cordura Sheath

Mfg in 1918 for your consideration.

For those that have never owned a Colt pistol produced in the early 1900's, you're really missing out. These guns were hand crafted and polished by highly skilled craftsmen long before the days of CNC machines, plastic parts and mass production methods robbed firearms of their personality. Most collectors agree that this era was the pinnacle of Colt's production quality. 

CONDITION: All original parts and finish. The frame has retained most of its beautiful original charcoal bluing with the frontstrap and trigger guard showing some patina. The frame overall shows some light freckling with no significant pitting or dents/dings. The original case colors are still bright on trigger and visible on the grip safety, safety and mag release. The slide shows a little more wear on the finish (too much time in it's holster) Much of its bluing is wearing thin and there is scattered freckling and patina throughout. No significant pitting or dents/dings. The bore looks good with well-defined rifling, and only very light pitting on first 1/3rd of bore. There is light pitting and some patina in the chamber of the bore. The original grips are in excellent condition with no significant wear and no cracks or chips. The magazine is the original two-tone, pinned magazine correctly showing no caliber marking on baseplate. It is in excellent condition showing almost no wear. 

FUNCTION: The slide/frame fit is still very tight, The springs are still strong and the action is smooth. Mechanically the pistol is in excellent shape. It functioned flawlessly at the range, and its' accuracy is still surprisingly good for a near antique pocket pistol. 

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: While not a safe-queen, this pistol is in very good shape and is still very collectible. The wear that it does show appears to be from honest use. I see no indications of misuse or abuse. This is a great opportunity to buy a 93 year old collectible Colt at a reasonable price that you wouldn't be apprehensive about taking to the range and enjoying.

I travel between Cinicinnati, Columbus and Dayton weekly and can meet you most places in-between.  I can be flexible on the timing as well.

Cash only and you must be willing to fill out a private bill of sale for my records.  I am not interested in trades at this time.

For those that have never owned a Colt pistol produced in the early 1900's, you're really missing out. These guns were hand crafted and polished by highly skilled craftsmen long before the days of CNC machines, plastic parts and mass production methods robbed firearms of their personality. Most collectors agree that this era was the pinnacle of Colt's production quality. 

CONDITION: All original parts and finish. The frame has retained most of its beautiful original charcoal bluing with the frontstrap and trigger guard showing some patina. The frame overall shows some light freckling with no significant pitting or dents/dings. The original case colors are still bright on trigger and visible on the grip safety, safety and mag release. The slide shows a little more wear on the finish (too much time in it's holster) Much of its bluing is wearing thin and there is scattered freckling and patina throughout. No significant pitting or dents/dings. The bore looks good with well-defined rifling, and only very light pitting on first 1/3rd of bore. There is light pitting and some patina in the chamber of the bore. The original grips are in excellent condition with no significant wear and no cracks or chips. The magazine is the original two-tone, pinned magazine correctly showing no caliber marking on baseplate. It is in excellent condition showing almost no wear. 

FUNCTION: The slide/frame fit is still very tight, The springs are still strong and the action is smooth. Mechanically the pistol is in excellent shape. It functioned flawlessly at the range, and its' accuracy is still surprisingly good for a near antique pocket pistol. 

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: While not a safe-queen, this pistol is in very good shape and is still very collectible. The wear that it does show appears to be from honest use. I see no indications of misuse or abuse. This is a great opportunity to buy a 93 year old collectible Colt at a reasonable price that you wouldn't be apprehensive about taking to the range and enjoying.

I travel between Cinicinnati, Columbus and Dayton weekly and can meet you most places in-between.  I can be flexible on the timing as well.

Cash only and you must be willing to fill out a private bill of sale for my records.  I am not interested in trades at this time.

For those unfamiliar this a new item from Kel-Tec that has a 30rd mag that shoots the .22 magnum round. Very fast ballistics. Referred to as the poor mans FN 5.7 

  All Kel-Tec brand mags (dont even know if anyone is making them aftermarket yet) This gun has about 240 rounds through it. (roughly 6 mags worth). 

   Also comes with a G17 black kydex holster that fits it like a glove. The retention button isnt perfect but it holds and works real well IMO.

  So again the pistol, 4 mags, and the holster.

Also have 1400 rds of .22WMR ammo for the PMR. At this moment I will gladly sell to the person who buys the PMR, but I do not want to finalize anything until the PMR gets sold 1st.
Breakdown of Ammo is as follows: 
12 boxes of CC Maxi Mag
6 CCI Maxi Mag HP's
1 Maxi Mag HP +V
2 Federal Game Shok HP 50gr
4 Winchester Dyna Points
1 Hornady 30gr VMax

As well as the 4 mags being loaded for at least another 110 rds. But I dont have the boxes anymore for those.

This usually goes for around $12 a box on average. The Federal and Hornady about $15 a box.

Will sell with the pistol at a deal, or $250 for all of the ammo seperate. Or will trade for equal worth of .223/5.56 ammo"

The only flaw on the whole gun is a tiny nic in the back of the grip at the top. It was like that when I got it and it doesn't affect the function of the firearm in any way.

Blue is 85% but NO rust or pitting anywhere. This gun has been in my family since 1959 so I know it's history and care. 
Someone over the years (DAD!) painted the sight red, a little rubbing and some thinner would take that right off.
