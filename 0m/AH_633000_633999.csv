That includes the push-button safety, early flip sight, and early barrel band. It is a low 5-million serial number.
The previous owner covered the metal in paint- I don't know what the state of the park is underneath, but the park's still there. I haven't taken any of the paint off.
The stock's either been worked on or is a repro, there's no stampings on it.
The barrel stamp has been obscured by the coat of paint.

It's a nice looking rifle and functions great. The bore is in very good condition.

It's been sitting in my safe for a few years, and has never been fired while I've had it. I'm really not into 'collector guns', and now feel it should go to someone who will appreciate it.

I've asked a few people about it's value and got prices ranging from $800 - $1500. I really have no idea, but did see a couple of Lahi's from Finland, which are similar and far more available, with prices of $1050 to $1325 at the antique show last week-end. My information is that these Husqvarna are much rarer and harder to find.

Anyway, the gun looks in excellent condition with very, very little signs of wear. The holster is also in good condition, and shows much better than you'd expect for it's age. I'll sell it for $800 OBO. It comes with 2 mags, it's original leather holster, a magazine assist loader and a barrel cleaning rod.

These magazines are factory originals (not aftermarket productions)manufactured by JP Sauer before 09/13/94 and are legal to own in NY State.  You can see the visible characteristics that establish them as pre-ban magazines, such as the ""dovetail"" weld on the backstrap (the backstraps are now smooth), the thin metal baseplates that contain no ""date-clock"" stamp on the bottom (thicker plastic baseplates are manufactured now), no LE/GOVT markings on the front strap, and the ""Triple J"" stamp is not even on the one magazine (this is particularly unique as it predates JP Sauer's stamping of their logo on magazines, though the ""Triple J"" logo can be found on pre and post ban mags).  All of these characteristics combined are good indicators of pre-ban Sig-Sauer magazines.  I am asking for $37.00 for each magazine or $70.00 for both plus $6.00 for shipping, as I am located in Pittsburgh, PA.  These magazines show some light cosmetic wear for their age but are in good shape overall and function fine.  I accept Paypal for payment, or certified checks or money orders, whichever you prefer.  I ship via USPS and it usually takes about three days to NY State.  If you have any questions or would like additional photos feel free to ask.

These magazines were manufactured before 09/13/94 and are legal to own in NY State.  You can see the visible characteristics that establish them as pre-ban magazines, such as the sharp ""V"" ridge near the sides of the magazine near the top (this sharp ridge was changed sometime during the ban and continued onto post ban production), as well as the thicker metal baseplates, and no LE/GOVT or serial/lot number markings.  I am asking for $39.00 for each magazine or $115.00 for all three plus $6.00 for shipping, as I am located in Pittsburgh, PA.  These magazines show some cosmetic wear for their age but are in good shape overall and function fine.  I accept Paypal for payment, or certified checks or money orders, whichever you prefer.  I ship via USPS and it usually takes about three days to NY State.  If you have any questions or would like additional photos feel free to ask.

I fired very few rounds through this shotgun.  This shotgun comes with attractive wood furniture and the harder to find 26 in. chrome lined barrel.  This shotgun is the same as the H&R excell auto shotgun.  the bolt is chrome plated and the gun has a magazine cut off as well as 4 different chokes tubes to handle most any hunting situation.
