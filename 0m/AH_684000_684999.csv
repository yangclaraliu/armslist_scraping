I bought 2 of these (one for myself and one for the wife) and although this makes my wives Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22 like a cheap P.O.S. she chose to keep the S&W because it is not as heavy.
So i figured i'd just throw it out there and see what I could get for it. Unlike the generic S&W, Colt, & H&K .22lr AR versions this is a true AR .22LR, true mil spec upper and mounts to any AR lower.
Includes bolt carrier and mags. This is brand new and has never been mounted. 

I also have a brand new in box Vortex Strikefire red dot with AR mount that was never even mounted that I bought for it that I may consider getting rid of or throwing in for the right deal.

$200 FIRM.

HISTORY:
My Father-in-Law got it for me and I barely used it.  He never shot it and bought it new.  I brought it out once to shoot it and probably shot about 18 rounds through it and then did my best cleaning it afterwards.  I'm not a shotgun expert by any means.  It is black with the wood synthetic stock and pump slider.  It has a nylon type case as well.

I don't use it and I'm going out on the road for a while so I would rather sell it then have it warp or something in my storage unit.  As it is now it is stored inside my room and has been stored indoors since it was purchased.

It's basically brand new.  LIke I said, it was loaded and reloaded 3 times for a total of 18 rounds so that is basically new.  

I think this price of $200 is more than fair.  The cheapest I have seen this gun new is $300.  

I'm not going to sell to any weirdos.  I would rather sell to a firearms enthusiast, hunter or sportsman.

More pics can be emailed if needed.





I have for trade the following;

Antique Japanese Nihonto Wakazashi sword from the Shinto Era.

Sword details;

This is an unsigned sword with an NTHK attribution to Hisamichi.

Hisamichi was a member of the Mishina School and there were several 
generations using this name. 

It is in reasonable polish there are some scuff marks on it but the details 
of the hamon and hada are clearly visible and all the detail can be seen. 

The fittings are fairly plain and in keeping with what is a quite austere and 
powerful blade (typically mishina in my experience).



Shinto Era smith's worked from around 1650 to 1800.

I would put this sword to be very early Shinto, probably around 1650 to 1700.

This sword would retail well over 3500.00 if not more, as it is made the traditional way Japanese swords were made, and no Chinese junk here, superb craftsmanship on this blade, and all of the fitting as well."

Be honest. Haven't you dreamed of owning a belt fed machine-gun lookalike? No? Quick! Check your pulse. You're dead! I get excited just hefting this beauty. I've always liked these. I've had them on backorder with my distributor since August of 2011. They finally arrived and it was worth the wait. These rifles are beautiful! I'm referring to the DSArms brand new in the box RPDS belt fed in 7.62X39. These were assembled by DSA using one of their own semi-auto receivers and, I believe, excellent condition Polish parts sets. The rifles are factory new. The furniture may have dings from their previous life. Some of the metal might too. Everything has been refinished and is beautiful. You can confirm that in the photos. The RPD was one in a series of weapons by a Russian arms designer named Degtyarov. Many of you will recognize that name. What he means most to me is the robust and simple locking system that he developed in the DP and continued on through the RPD to the PKM and even the big DSHK. In the RPD, due to its smaller caliber, the action is remarkable robust. The machinegun was put into widescale service in 1953. It was the standard machine gun of the Vietcong during our war with them. Once the Kalashnikov guns came into favor, Russia moved away from the RPD, but it continues to serve in African and Asian nations right up until today. I think I read that Bolivia still uses them too. So, although this is a design of an earlier time, it's effective enough to still serve in smaller countries today. It has this proven heritage. These guns fire from the closed bolt using a striker. The semi-auto disconnect limits them to one round per trigger pull. Let me go over some features as I examine this trophy lying across my lap. The feed cover latches positively and locks open reliably. Lifting it reveals a simple feed mechanism operated by the lug on the top rear of the bolt assembly. The rear sight is windage adjustable and has steps in 100 meter increments to 1000 meters. It has a square notch. I wonder how ballistically effective the AK round is out that far. Remember, it's ballistically about like a 30/30. The front handguard is wood. Pretty too. Moving forward is the block with the sling attachment point. Then comes the adjustable gas block. The front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation to allow you to zero the rear sight. A bipod is mounted just to the rear of the front sight assembly. The bipod folds under the barrel. There is a cleaning rod to the lower left of the receiver. The feed mechanism has dust covers on both sides. There is a mechanism for hanging the belt drum which is a container for the non-disintegrating belt. The trigger pull is heavy. The safety is accessible to the right trigger finger. The wood buttstock is pristine. The buttplate has an access door to the recoil assembly and the cleaning kit storage. This rifle comes with two drums with belts and two canvas pouches to contain them. There is a canvas carry case for the rifle. There is a rifle sling, a cleaning and tool kit, an attachment that threads onto the muzzle to guide the cleaning rod and spare the muzzle. The rifle will arrive in an hard case. The manual is extensive. Very nice! I paid over $75 for my RPD manual and this one is every bit as good. I will be glad to do what's necessary to ship this to you in Alabama or other oppressive states. Do your homework to find out if your dealer will accept it and do the transfer, then email me before you bid and discuss what you need me to do.

Noreen has created the ONLY SEMI-AUTOMATIC .300 WIN MAG and .338 Lapua on the market. The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots. 

The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot. 

This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action. 

The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action. The innovative Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua ULR provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA and also includes, Piston-driven semi-automatic action

Made in 1933, Hex reciever, IZZY. Wood is as well perfect, far as I can tell no cracks or repairs. Comes with about 100 rds ammo and stripper clips!  

Looking for $135 out of rifle with the ammo.  Just got it cleaned it up, haven't even had time to check headspace, firing pin protrusion,  so that's up to you.

Pics to follow.

Thanks"

The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots. 

The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot.

I don't remember the brand but I want to say it is a Liberty. I have had it for a few years and have out grown it as you can see by the photos. When I bought it my wife hated the color, and since it was going into the house instead of in the garage (Man Cave), I sanded it all down and took it to my friends auto body shop and sprayed it. My wife picked Toyota Camry Gold, and it came out really nice. It is more of a tan than a bright gold. The lock is a S&G combination, not one of those battery operated locks that can fail. The new safe that I bought has the battery powered lock and I will be swapping it out ASAP. Dimensions are 20"" deep, 30"" wide and 63"" tall, when I cropped the photo it came out looking real skinny, but it isn't, just go by the dimensions and you will see that it is a nice sized safe.. I had always planned to redo the interior but never got around to it. I am not going to ask a high price so I can haggle with someone, not the way I work. Bottom line is I need $500 out of this safe and it is worth every penny of it. Delivery can be arranged for $1 per mile round trip. My 1 ton diesel truck doesn't run air, and with the price of diesel nowadays this is a fair price. If you want me to deliver the safe, I can get it loaded here, but I will need help on your end to unload it. This will be posted on Craigslist as well as other gun forums. I will go by time stamp if I receive multiple ""I'll Take It"" replies. The safe is located in Mount Airy North Carolina. Well I think that sums it up. Thanks for your interest."

Personally, give me a beautifull hardwood stocked rifle any day over the synthetic crap so common these days! It comes complete in original box new including scope mounts, breech lock and 5 round mag. As a bonus, if sold at my asking price of $700, I will throw in a brand new blue steel Ruger brand 30 round Mini-14 magazine. These Ruger 30 rd. mags sell for $50.00 new right now on Ruger.com. The Mini-14 Rancher w/ 5 rd. mag currently retails for $881.00 new for a total retail cost of $931 not including any tax. The kicker here is you'll have a hard time finding another Mini-14 with this beautiful of a stock! Remember this is an absolutely brand new set up. Without the 30 round mag the least I will accept is $675 CASH- with the 30 rd. Ruger mag it's $700 CASH. If you are serious and ready to buy, drop me a line but I will not haggle or dicker on this one. I am not interested in any trades, cash sale only."

------------------>(update 11-29-12, only bother to read if you intend to respond to this ad)
I've gotten several replies, and want to clarify something. I am not selling this gun because I have to. I'm selling it because I never use the thing, and could use the money to buy another gun that I will use more. I do not want to haggle AT ALL. I am willing to trade for one of three VERY specific guns, and will TRADE for ONLY one of those three. They are, in order of preference: Glock 26, Keltec Sub-2000 in 9mm (Glock 9 mag), and the Glock 17

I do NOT want ANYTHING else. No 1911's, no storage unit treasure hunt, no shotguns, nothing. I want cash, or the guns listed above only. If your intended reply is something other than a request to come see the gun, an offer of cash in the amount of $450, or a trade for one of the 3 guns....please don't bother. Consider this my reply:

Everything you are offering is probably very awesome, and well worth the trade...but I'm still not interested. Thanks anyway.

Mother Russia's most historically proven early battle rifle and our most popular selling rifle by far.  And why not, these fine rifles have been meticulously refinished in Russian arsenals before release for export and they look great.  Not only are they 100% functional, but they have a reputation for being reliable, hard hitting, and extremely accurate.  The 7.62x54r round was the Warsaw Pact heavy caliber from the early 20's until modern day, so surplus ammunition is very plentiful and extremely affordable.  This renown cartridge is more powerful than a .308 and ballistically rivals our 30/06 caliber.  This round is more than adequate for harvesting any Big Game animal in North America.  Rifle is extremely accurate up to 300 plus yards with open sights and is capable of accuracy out to 1000 yards with proper optics.  Without a doubt the Mosin Nagant M91/30 provides by far the most bang for the buck of any rifle on the market today.  Here you have a rifle capable of taking any big game in North America at respectable yardage, fires affordable ammo, and can be obtained for less that the price of a high end pellet rifle."

This is the real deal WWII vintage M97 Trench Gun.

According to my research, this gun meets nearly all the specs outlined in Joe Poyer's book ""U.S. Winchester Trench and Riot Guns"". However, I believe the stock has been replaced as it does not show the Ordanance inspection markings. The receiver is stamped ""U.S."" and the ""Flaming Bomb"" is where it should be on the top to the barrel forward of the receiver. The bluing is so good that it is possible that it has been refinished. 

It also comes with what I believe to be a correct bayonet and scabbard.

The price is FIRM!

I'm looking to get a Glock 26 or 17 and will accept even-up trades for either, new or used as long as its not all beat to hell, with at least 1 magazine.

This is the pistol that Taurus designed on the Beretta 92. These usually sell for between $400 and $450 used (Taurus had the MSRP listed at considerably more). I am asking for that WITH the grip, holster, and extra extended mag that had a combined cost of over $60.

It includes:
Two original 17rnd mags 
An aftermarket (promag) 30rnd mag. GREAT at the range!
Pachmayr grips (which are much nicer than the Hogue grips IMHO, the original grips are also included).
An OWB holster that I bought for it but didn't really like.

------------------>(update 11-29-12, only bother to read if you intend to respond to this ad)
I've gotten several replies, and want to clarify something. I am not selling this gun because I have to. I'm selling it because I never use the thing, and could use the money to buy another gun that I will use more. I do not want to haggle AT ALL. I am willing to trade for one of three VERY specific guns, and will TRADE for ONLY one of those three. They are, in order of preference: Glock 26, Keltec Sub-2000 in 9mm (Glock 9 mag), and the Glock 17

I do NOT want ANYTHING else. No 1911's, no storage unit treasure hunt, no shotguns, nothing. I want cash, or the guns listed above only. If your intended reply is something other than a request to come see the gun, an offer of cash in the amount of $450, or a trade for one of the 3 guns....please don't bother. Consider this my reply:

Everything you are offering is probably very awesome, and well worth the trade...but I'm still not interested. Thanks anyway.
