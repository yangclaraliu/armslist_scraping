Description From Specter:
This rig carries 4 mil-spec M-16/AR-15 type 5.56mm 30 round magazines in two pouches attached to a leg shroud with a vertically adjustable hanger strap to suspend the pouches below the belt line with 2 adjustable 2"" wide leg straps to secure the assembly to the upper thigh.
The pouch bodies are constructed with a 1000 denier nylon outer layer and a 420 denier nylon inner layer. The pouches feature both hook and loop as well as side release buckle closures for maximum versatility and pouch security.
The pouches also feature our ""Blow Through Bottom"" design for maximum drainage of water, sand and debris.
This rig, as well as all of our other tactical thigh rigs, features a heavy duty 2"" side release buckle attached to the vertical hanger strap which allows for rapid removal of the rig. This allows users to efficiently switch loadouts without having to remove their belt.   
The fully adjustable double leg straps are made with comfortable, yet durable, 2"" webbing with heavy duty side release buckle closures and heavy duty elastic loops to allow for expansion of the thigh straps during movement. The leg straps also feature 2 rows of imbedded rubber stitching on the inside to prevent shifting and movement of the rig. Both leg straps are removable as well as reversible for left handed users.
Note: The pouches on this rig are designed to hold mil-spec type M-16/AR-15 magazines. However, we've found that 30 round magazines of a similar size as the mil-spec M-16/AR-15 such as those for the Mini-14 will work quite well. Please call or email if you have questions concerning fit."

This gun is basically the same size as a Ruger LCP (or the Keltec that Ruger copied), only it has these useful things called 'features.' Slide release with last round hold-open, functional sights...you know, things you expect in a handgun that doesn't need to be jammed into someone's belly to be effective.

But I digress...this really is an excellent little firearm. I believe it measures at 0.9"" thick and under a pound unloaded (disappears inside a waistband), and has a smooth, consistent trigger pull and a nice sight design. Recoil is quite manageable for such a small 9mm, mostly due in part to the nifty recoil spring design.

This is basically a brand new gun, other than the fact that it had an initial cleaning/oiling upon purchase, followed by a test fire of 100 rounds with zero malfunctions. It was then cleaned, lightly re-oiled, and has not been fired since. Each mag has about fifty rounds through it.

Everything that you would get with a brand new purchase is there, plus an additional magazine (flush mag holds six rounds, extended is seven).

Asking $500 OBO."

Wanted to see if anyone's interested in buying my Ruger 1911. Only 500 rds downrange--barely broken in! I've got some Hogue rubber grips on her right now and will include the original wood Ruger grips as well. Also comes with 6 magazines (some 7/some 8 rounders) and 50 rds of PMC Bronze 230gr Hardball. Also have 7 rds of Federal Hydrashok 230gr nickel-cased hollowpoints to go with it as well. Also comes with original box and Ruger soft case.

This isn't one of those picky 1911's--hollowpoints, hardball, steelcased russian ammo--it feeds it all 100%.

If you didn't know, the Ruger 1911 is based on the Series 70's-- NO firing pin block BS. 5"" barrel, Stainless frame and slide with black accessories.

This really is a sweet gun, hate to sell it but need cash for bills and stuff--y'all know how it is.

Asking $750 for everything. Heck, if you're a lefty I have a Crossbreed Supertuck for it that can go with it, too!

I'm located in Greenville, SC. SC residents only 21+. Must have valid ID and/or proof of age & residency.

Guys, if you want a sweet .45 but don't wanna fork over $2k for a custom-build, this is the one for you!

Will take $535 cash, or $600-650 range in trade value.

Has a no-bind modification on the trigger housing to ensure a blow to the action release or sand/dirt won't make the release inoperable and so you can blow it clean with spray cans of gun wash. Barrel shortened to sit just a bit behind the end of the magazine tube, to protect it from dings. Finished in Matte Black Alumahyde. Has a simple OD green quick adjust sling that is included. Recoil reducing GL-Shock stock makes even buckshot and slugs comfortable to shoot allows quicker follow-up shots than a .12 gauge. The shell latches should probably be re-staked eventually. Doesn't affect the operation of the gun (they are held in place by the trigger plate assembly pins), just adds a step in reassembly from a complete tear-down. A shell latch staking tool runs $30-35 and it's a simple operation.

But many SIG shooters have asked for a P220 with a longer slide, one that would compete head-to-head with other five inch barreled 45's. The result? The first P220 Match prototype went to our testing range where it shot an eight-round group measuring 0.64” at 20 yards. Our engineers after extensive review concluded that this was a good starting point.

The P220 Match Elite adds the most sought after features to the P220 Match - beavertail stainless frame, front strap checkering, adjustable target sights, SIG's innovative Short Reset Trigger (a DA/SA trigger system with a 60% reduction in trigger reset) and black anodize aluminum grips. (NOTE: Grips shown have been discontinued. We have replaced with a similar grip without the white SIG SAUER logo. They have just a stamped logo).

He is as much a part of the problem as anyone else, trolling the internet for parts in stock and buying them all up.  

Then he'll take advantage you with his ""custom built"" AR that he put maybe $500 into and charge you $1,000 to $1,200.  Now you are just paying double the price for a piece of junk AR that he threw together as fast as he could.  So go ahead and buy his AR and hope it doesn't blow up in your face at the range.  

You'll often see this troll in the parking lot of the gun show trying to buy your quality AR for dirt cheap prices or in other forums b###hing about the current gun market.  This person is not your friend or trying to help his fellow gun lovers.   If so, have him sell you his factory built AR for a decent price and see how the price jumps."

Anyway it is the wolvering model utilizing the #11 percussion caps . I have a new pound of Pyrodex RS powder ($22) and some sabots that I will give with sale. Rifle has fiber optics sights installed. Will sell for 85. Had it listed for 100 a week ago and lot of interest but no takers so I lowered the price and added the extras. also have percussion caps to go with as well.

407,http://www.armslist.com/posts/814407,For Trade:  LWRC M6A2 .223/5.56 RIFLE short-stroke gas-piston,"Fairfield, Ohio, Ohio, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 8, 2013",Rifles,LWRC International                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I own two of these. And I'm only looking to trade one for a LWRC M6 SPR. Doubt anyone on here actually owns a High end rifle or know's what one is. Since all I'm seeing is low end rifles going for over $2k. If you would like to know, this rifle is pulling $3500-$5,000 right. 

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths and in either 5.56mm NATO or 6.8mm SPC. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

The .50 Alaskan is a wildcat cartridge developed by Harold Johnson and Harold Fuller of the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska in the 1950s. Johnson based the cartridge on the .348 Winchester in order to create a rifle capable of handling the large bears in Alaska. Design: Harold Johnson necked out the .348 Winchester case to accept a .510"" diameter bullet, and Harold Fuller developed the barrel, marrying a .50 caliber barrel to an old Winchester Model 1886 rifle. Since the rifle was designed for use on Alaska’s great bears, Johnson cut 720-grain (47 g) boat-tail .50 BMG bullets in half, seating the 450-grain (29 g) rear half upside down in the fireformed .50-caliber case. It didn’t take Johnson long to find out that the 450-grain truncated shaped “solid” would shoot through a big brown bear from any direction, claiming in 1988, “I never recovered a slug from a bear or moose, no matter what angle the animal was shot at. Harold’s favorite load in the .50 Alaskan was 51.5 grains (3.34 g) of IMR-4198 with a Barnes 400-grain (26 g) flatnose ,jacketed bullet for about 2,100 ft/s (640 m/s) and just under 4,000 ft·lbf (5,400 J)of muzzle energy Shipping/handling is going to be $55 and insurance will be added at 1.75% of the item's value to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping.

This gun was produced in the late 1950’s and still has 95% bluing and 90% stock. There are a few minor dings, and someone did a poor job of installing sling swivel studs, but otherwise it looks great. The gun doesn’t look new but looks pretty good for being 55 years old. It also comes with approx. 150 pieces of brass (80 original Remington and 20 original Winchester) and a newer Hornady dimension die. Buyer pays actual shipping and all FFL fees, I must get a copy of your FFL’s license before shipment. Cashier’s Check only."

I just went up to a lot more expensive gun and I am hoping I get the reliability I got with this one at the range.  I have approximately 700 rounds through it.  It will feed and eat any ammo.  The only ammo it does not like racking is cheap federal from walmart, and that is the first rack.  Speer gold dots feed perfect winchester whites, blazers, and any other ammo I have ever fed.  Just that damn walmart federal racking.  
Never a light primer strike, never a fail to feed (accept walmart federal on rack), fail to fire, fail to eject.  
What you get
-SR9C Black on Black with everything that came with it.  The 17 and 10 round magazines. All original paperwork speed loader etc.
- An extra 10 round and 17 round magazine.  You cannot find the 17's anymore and they run $55 and the 10's run $35 if you can find them.
-Traction grips, not installed yet $10.99
- Desantis pocket or tuck inside wastband holster 16.50
-27 rounds of speer gold dot 124 grain +p ammo in the two spare magazines.  $40
I have nearly $600 tied up in this with the extras.  I am not looking for 600  but I am looking for fair offers.  Email me with your offers for everything above.  I am not looking to part it separately. Over 21 with ID and preferably a CCH carrier.   I also have an LC9 for sale that is practically brand new listed just before this.

Those who know YHM (Yankee Hill Machine) and RRA (Rock River Arms) know this is not just another AR that has been thrown together and it has some extras.  Details on the upper are as follows:

The Diamond forearm bridges the gap between the upper receiver and hand guard and is marked for position on all 4 sides. YHM's diamond pattern in the hand guard reduces weight and blends perfectly with the diamond fluted barrels.

Features Include:
* Forged 7075-T6 Aluminum YHM Flat Top Upper Receiver
* ""T"" Marked Upper Receiver
* Forward Assist
* 16"" 4140 Steel Barrel, Heat Treated to RC 25-32
* Chambered in 5.56 N.A.T.O., Chrome-Lined with either a 1:9"" or 1:7"" Twist
* YHM Diamond Fluting Improves Rigidity and Aids in Barrel Cooling
* YHM Phantom 5C2 Flash Hider / Compensator (YHM-28-5C2)
* YHM Specter Length Diamond Handguard (YHM-9637-DX)
* YHM Forearm Endcap (YHM-9484-A)
* YHM Low Profile Gas Block (YHM-9384)
* YHM Forearm Mounted Flip Front Sight (YHM-9627)
* YHM Flip Rear Sight (YHM-9680)

This AR also comes with the collapsible Vltor EMOD (Enhanced Modstock) this stock is not just your plain jane collapsible stock! The buttplate of the EMOD is slightly wider and longer at the toe than the regular M4 stock with a noticeable negative pitch, making transitions from the ready feel much more natural. The EMOD was given enough weight to help balance out the normally muzzle heavy feel associated with negative pitch buttstocks.  The EMOD features more storage in the removable, waterproof side compartments; the EMOD holds up to four CR123 or three AA batteries. There is also an additional weather proof compartment in the clubfoot area of the stock, this compartment can be accessed quickly and holds two AA batteries or other small parts.

This AR also has the Magpul Rifle Grip as well as the Magpul Vertical Grip in tan.  This weapon will come with a 30rd matching PMAG with the option to purchase more if you want.

I will take $2000 OBO for the AR.  My local shop has AR's listed right now much higher than that and lots of them are of lesser quality.  Figured I would try to sell it on my own first so number one I dont have to pay them a consignment fee and number 2 someone has the option of purchasing one without paperwork.  I also do not mind working through an FFL if that makes you more comfortable.  However I will require a valid id or drivers license regardless.  At the gun show over the weekend and they were selling AR's for much more than $2500 and Pmags were going for $100 each.  I am taking a gamble on selling this one because if this ban does go through and if anyone remembers the Clinton ban knows what these weapons and mags will be worth if they get it pushed through and my feelings are you wont be able to purchase one again without class 3 paperwork.

If you are really serious please feel free to email or call or text REDACTED.  As info if this listing is still present the rifle is still available.  Only trades that really interest me would be a Benelli Super Vinci or Wilson Combat 1911's."

Tech. Specs: caliber- .308 Win./ 7.62 NATO, operating system-roller block delay, Barrel- hammer forged, Rifling- 4 groove, 1 in 11, barrel length-18in. Anyone familiar with the SAR-8 is aware that this rifle was manufactured as a licensed copy of the HK91/93, made on HK tooling with HK technical assistance given to Helenic Arms of Greece. As Mark Christian stated, ""These rifles are not clones, they are the real thing"". 

Years ago HK set up a Greek company(Hellenic Arms) with HK tooling and HK trained techs to make HK91's.These were imported by Springfield Armory as SAR3's.When the 89 ban hit the ones that were in the process of being imported were restamped SAR8's––these are called overstamps.SAR3's and SAR8 overstamps are equal to true HK91's in most everybodys opinion.AFTER the ban Springfield imported parts kits and used American made receivers(Federal Arms) to make another version that was also called SAR8.The Federal Arms receiver SAR8's can be easily identified by the fact that they have a rail.The Federal Arms SAR8's are such junk that for years Springfield would give you a very generous credit towards one of their M1A's if you sent them your Federal Arms SAR8 so they could get it out of the market.

760,http://www.armslist.com/posts/814760,For Sale:  AR-15 YHM/ RRA,"Harrison, AR, Springfield, Missouri","$ 2,000","Listed On: Tuesday, January 8, 2013",Rifles,Yankee Hill Machine                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"For sale is a very nice RRA complete lower and the flagship YHM Specter Black Diamond Carbine Upper. Those who know YHM (Yankee Hill Machine) and RRA (Rock River Arms) know this is not just another AR that has been thrown together and it has some extras. Details on the upper are as follows:

The Diamond forearm bridges the gap between the upper receiver and hand guard and is marked for position on all 4 sides. YHM's diamond pattern in the hand guard reduces weight and blends perfectly with the diamond fluted barrels.

Features Include:
* Forged 7075-T6 Aluminum YHM Flat Top Upper Receiver
* ""T"" Marked Upper Receiver
* Forward Assist
* 16"" 4140 Steel Barrel, Heat Treated to RC 25-32
* Chambered in 5.56 N.A.T.O., Chrome-Lined with either a 1:9"" or 1:7"" Twist
* YHM Diamond Fluting Improves Rigidity and Aids in Barrel Cooling
* YHM Phantom 5C2 Flash Hider / Compensator (YHM-28-5C2)
* YHM Specter Length Diamond Handguard (YHM-9637-DX)
* YHM Forearm Endcap (YHM-9484-A)
* YHM Low Profile Gas Block (YHM-9384)
* YHM Forearm Mounted Flip Front Sight (YHM-9627)
* YHM Flip Rear Sight (YHM-9680)

This AR also comes with the collapsible Vltor EMOD (Enhanced Modstock) this stock is not just your plain jane collapsible stock! The buttplate of the EMOD is slightly wider and longer at the toe than the regular M4 stock with a noticeable negative pitch, making transitions from the ready feel much more natural. The EMOD was given enough weight to help balance out the normally muzzle heavy feel associated with negative pitch buttstocks. The EMOD features more storage in the removable, waterproof side compartments; the EMOD holds up to four CR123 or three AA batteries. There is also an additional weather proof compartment in the clubfoot area of the stock, this compartment can be accessed quickly and holds two AA batteries or other small parts.

This AR also has the Magpul Rifle Grip as well as the Magpul Vertical Grip in tan. This weapon will come with a 30rd matching PMAG with the option to purchase more if you want.

I will take $2000 OBO for the AR. My local shop has AR's listed right now much higher than that and lots of them are of lesser quality. Figured I would try to sell it on my own first so number one I dont have to pay them a consignment fee and number 2 someone has the option of purchasing one without paperwork. I also do not mind working through an FFL if that makes you more comfortable. However I will require a valid id or drivers license regardless. At the gun show over the weekend and they were selling AR's for much more than $2500 and Pmags were going for $100 each. I am taking a gamble on selling this one because if this ban does go through and if anyone remembers the Clinton ban knows what these weapons and mags will be worth if they get it pushed through and my feelings are you wont be able to purchase one again without class 3 paperwork.

If you are really serious please feel free to email or call or text REDACTED.  As info if this listing is still present then the rifle is still available. Only trades that really interest me would be a Benelli Super Vinci or Wilson Combat 1911's."

The first thing you’ll notice about this little plinker is the gold anodize finish on receiver. This thing definitely stands out in a crowd.

The original 22/45 hit the market in 1992 to provide a training for 1911 owners, as the feel and grip accurately imitates its larger carry counterparts.


This version features an upper receiver that is made of aircraft-grade aluminum and features serrated cuts and a 4.4-inch stainless steel barrel sleeve that is held in place by a tension nut. The barrel also features a factory 1/2-28 thread to accept popular muzzle accessories. The Zytel polymer grip frame features replaceable Hogue black rubber grip panels that can be swapped out for most aftermarket grips.The shiny gold receiver is drilled and tapped for Weaver-style scope base adapters which are included free of charge. The gun has an up-to-date feel and look and seems to be a great next step in this vaunted line.

Ruger released the following quote from President and CEO Mike Fifer:

The Ruger 22/45 Lite™ is an exciting new addition to the legendary 22/45 line of pistols. It maintains the superb accuracy and reliability of the classic 22/45 pistols, but has a cool factor that can’t be beat. It has a customized look without the customized price, and is exactly what our customers have been asking us to produce. The threaded barrel provides great accessory options and makes the Ruger 22/45 Lite™ a perfect package right out of the box.

It is their Smooth Carbine model 8200. If you are looking for a top of the line rifle, this is it. With their YHM smooth handguard, it allows you to have rails where you need them and not in places that interfere with your hand or rest. The 8200 also features their Black Diamond barrel fluting which reduces weight and increases heat dissipation. It has an excellent trigger and built in flip up iron sights. It only has 330 rounds of factory ammo fired, and was always properly cleaned and maintained. It is as close to new as you will find a rifle that has been shot.

I have added a few upgrades to make the rifle even better. I installed a Troy Battle Ax stock which gives a great cheek weld and also makes it more effective as a CQB rifle. I added a Ergo Grip to make it even more comfortable. The factory stock, grip and hardshell case are included as well. I am also including 6 magazines with the rifle. 1 Windowed Pmag, 2 Colt, 1 Bushmaster, 1 Sig Sauer and 1 NHMTG. 

The optic shown in the photo is a Trijicon TA01NSN-DOC. It has been upgraded with a GG&G Accucam Mount with integral lense covers. The optic has an MSRP of over $2,000 and a street price around $1,700. The GG&G mount sells for $192 + Shipping. It comes complete with its Pelican case, all paperwork including decals, tools and Docter information. This is the best optic I have ever used on an AR. It allows you to make quick shots at 600 yards plus, and then use the Docter for close engagements. If the buyer is interested in the ACOG as well, it can be added for an additional $1,200 

Pllease keep in mind that this is a quality factory rifle with nothing but the best parts. Don't waste your money on a Frankenstein build that you can't trust the quality of, with garbage Chinese optics and an unknown builder. Invest in a rifle that will only continue to go up in value and will give you years of trouble free shooting.

Any questions please ask. The price is FIRM, any less and I will keep it. Atlas Bipod and additional PMags shown in photos are not included in the sale.
