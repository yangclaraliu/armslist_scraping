I have a Yugo m59/66 sks in excellent condition.  Really ffl not shoot it anymore and in fact have put less then 100 rds down range since I have had it.  

I bought it just over a year ago as a birthday gift to me.  All accessories come with.  Has the bayonet, grenade launcher and ladder sight, sling, cleaning rod, attached box mag.  All numbers match.  Also have ammo pouch, stripper clips, oil can.

I got this gun and it was ""new in box"" / unissued.  It was also covered in cosmoline.  The stock had no finish on it .  A birchwood Casey stock finish was applied.

Gun shoots straight and functions flawlessly.  Really looking to trade either up or down.  Not really sure what I want to replace it and will only replace it with something that interests me.

http://www.hawkeoptics.com/rifle-scopes/sidewinder-30.html

The Hawke Sidewinder's 30mm body encompasses a high quality optical system with Fully Multi-Coated glass. This in turn provides sharp, bright and high resolution viewing in all light conditions.

The lens configurations have been carefully selected to offer the optimum performance in low light conditions, while offering excellent range finding properties. The Sidewinder features a side focusing system designed to parallax from 10yds to infinity.

By popular demand, the Hawke Sidewinder 30 is available with either a Hawke SR6 / SR12 or a ½mil dot true at 10x or 20x depending on model.The reticle illumination brightness adjustment is positioned on the side focus turret.

This allows 5 red and 5 green settings. The settings have been carefully considered to produce low enough illumination levels for dawn and dusk shooting

The open sniper style turrets are calibrated to 1/4 MOA per click. To adjust the turrets the whole assembly is pulled up to unlock, then once adjusted they can be securely locked into position by pushing the turret back down.

The turrets are simply reset to ""0"" by loosening a hex screw on the top.All Hawke Sidewinders come with a large 4"" side wheel, to enhance range finding, a sunshade for bright conditions, and screw-in lens covers to protect the outer lenses.

SR Reticles are registered designs.

The ad claims that the mount is the new cross-bolt mount, but the  photos show it to be the old two screw mount which has been discontinued because they strip out the threads in the mount and the mount comes loose and unstable.

ASK THE SELLER TO VERIFY HIS MOUNT HAS THE NEWER CROSS-BOLT MOUNT BEFORE YOU BUY IT.

Photos of the newer cross-bolt mount are shown below for comparison. Also. . . note that the newer cross-bolt mount is shorter than the older long mount which interferes with proper mounting of his scope.

** This new scope mount has been designed to provide lower ""visual alignment"" mounting for scout scopes. Alloy steel cross bolt mounting to the rear sight base with a locking nut provides a secure installation and insures that this mount will not shoot loose.

The easily installed, ""no gunsmithing"" mount replaces the rear sight leaf. (Detailed installation instructions are included with the mount). Simply remove the rear sight leaf and leaf spring, then insert and bolt in the scout mount. Attach the included Weaver style rings to the Picatinny mount and install the extended eye relief (EER) scout scope. You can restore the rifle to its original configuration by unbolting the scope and mount and reinstalling the rear sight.

Some Mosin Nagant scope mounts were designed with two short bolts that attach through the side “ears” of the rear sight base and thread into the scope mount. With extended shooting these bolts strip out the threads in the aluminum scope mount and the mount comes loose. Our mount has been threaded completely through and is fitted with a full length threaded alloy steel cross bolt and retaining nut that securely attaches the scope mount to the rear sight base.

Ring Specifications:
+ Strong Lightweight Aluminum
+ Non-Slip Mounting

The proof markings and serial number indicate that this pistol was made in 1945 but was not issued to a military force as it does not have a military proof mark.

There is quite a bit of wear to the bluing as well as some scratches and dings but no rust. It comes with one 8 round magazine. Asking $300 but negotiable on the price. 

History:
The ""Second Model"" added several, mostly external, features to make the pistol look and handle more like the Colt 1911A1. The frame was changed to provide an arched backstrap and a larger safety as well as more rugged and higher-visibility sights."

About the M59/66A1:
The Zastava 7.62 mm M59/66A1 gas-operated self-loading rifle closely resembles the Russian Federation Simonov SKS rifle. Initially copies of the original SKS-45 were made in Yugoslavia and given the designation M59, later a permanently attached grenade-launcher spigot and grenade launcher sight were added and the new weapon designated the M59/66. The final model was the M59/66A1.

I have a 2002 Chevy 1500 truck for sale (120000 miles). It is a step side, single cab, 5.3 motor, and it is 2WD with 3.73 rear axel with posi. This is a extremely rare combo chevy didn't build virtually any trucks like this with the big 5.3 (all were 4.8s). It has a truxedo tonneau cover, paint matched rhino liner, aluminum trac rack, and plastic floor mat/carpet protectors. It also has a stealth dump truck dump bed kit ( http://stealthdumptrucks.com/ ) that cost 4,000$ installed. It also has upgraded 2500HD springs in the rear and upgraded shocks. Trailer brake wired in, and a solid hitch. Pictures can be seen here:  http://milwaukee.craigslist.org/cto/REDACTED.html And by email

Overall the truck is in good shape. Tires are good, paint is overall good (some dings here and there). It has been serviced on time every time with synthetic oil, and its had the transmission fluid drained/changed (with new filter) twice in its life. Engine runs great, trans shifts fine, and it is a hell of a nice work vehicle. 

I am selling it because I have put 2K miles on it in the last year, and don't need it. I put the following things on it in the last 2,000 miles:

New fuel pump
New fuel pressure regulator
New u-joints in the driveshaft
New drivers window motor
All new front brakes (pads/rotors/bearings) (rears were done within the last 5K miles)
New fuel filter

It is completely ready to go to work for you. It gets around 22 to 23 MPG highway depending on tire air pressure (tires can be aired up to 70psi for heavy loads) and 16 to 17 mpg city. It has more then enough power to tow anything you might want to. The price is 8,000 and I am firm on that. I believe that is more then a fair price for this truck. Please e-mail me with your questions, Thanks -Greg"

Purchased for concealed carry, but I ended up always carrying my XD instead.  All original parts are included; pistol, mag with standard floor plate, mag with ""snap-grip"" floorplate (http://www.berettausa.com/products/px4-storm-subcompact-9mm-magazine-14-rds-snap-grip/jmpx4s9e/), lock and keys, manuals and papers, 3 replaceable grips (largest installed), hard case, and weird case support thing (http://www.handgunforum.net/beretta/26115-blue-dish-92fs.html, different pistol, same object).

(Apologies for the picture quality; it's a cell phone, and I'm a terrible photographer.)

For another $50 I'll include the Pelican case with foam I custom cut for the pistol.  The cuts aren't tidy, but case retention is still better than egg carton or the pick'n'pluck that came with the case.

It's been shot 200-300 times.  Beyond the slight wear from firing, there is negligeable other wear: a mark 1mm long on the right side of the grip, and some marks inside the grip from removing the smaller backstrap.

Hand-delivery only, unless buyer pays FFL fees.  I will deliver to any point within 1/2 hour of south College Station; will negotiate further than that.  I will need a valid ID presented, and will need a countersigned bill of sale.  No money orders, checks will have to clear before delivery.  Visa, American Express, MasterCard and Discover via Square.  Sorry, but C(my)A.

I would also consider a trade or trade-in-part for a good 1911 (Springfield Armory or better), or a good Garand."

The Pusca Semiautomata cu Luneta (Rifle, Semiautomatic with Scope) was originallymanufactured at the Romanian Cugir arsenal starting in the mid 1970s. When Romania started offering their PSL for export, it was then manufactured at the Regia Autonoma de Tehnicå Militarå (RATMIL) factory and had their bayonet lugs removed to meet U.S. import restrictions. After a consolidation of military arsenals when Romania joined NATO in 2004, production of the PSL moved to the ARMS arsenal in Cugir, Romania which was completely retooled with all new state-of-the-art modern equipment purchased from Belgium and Croatia. PSLs are exported to the US by C.N. ROMARM S.A. of Bucharest, Romania.
At various times the PSL has been imported into the US by different companies both large and small.

This pistol is in pristine condition having been fired and broken in but not much more than that. It functions 100% with factory FMJ ammo and self defense hollow points and is cosmetically flawless. I'll include the bicycle tube grip sleeve as shown in the photos or, remove it if the buyer prefers.

This gun Lists for $805 and sells at online discounters for $636 or more. My price is $495 plus shipping to your FFL or FTF in Central Florida area. The only trade I would consider is for a Kahr P380 with some money coming from the P380 owner. I have numerous online references including 100% positive feedback on both ebay and Gunbroker. Thanks for looking.
