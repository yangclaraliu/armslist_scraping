Slide Fire Solutions' SSAR-15 ground breaking ""Slide Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to Bump Fire more safely - offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere!

Completely 100% legal to own and use!
Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire - this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the firearm. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.

Available in both Right and Left handed models 
Quickly installs on any AR-15 with an adjustable stock 
Constructed of premium reinforced high strength polymer 
Compatible with Mil-Spec and Commercial buffer tubes 
Winter trigger guards and some sling attachment points may not be compatible 
The SSAR-15 is designed for use on all AR-15 rifles equipped with a carbine style buffer tube. There are no permanent modifications or gunsmith required to install the SSAR-15. 

By removing the factory pistol grip and replacing it with the provided Interface Block - the SSAR-15 simply slides onto the buffer tube; replacing the factory adjustable stock. All tools required to install the SSAR-15 are provided.

Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, BATFE Approval Letter, and Installation / Operation Instructions.

The SSAR-15 is NOT a mechanical device. It does not perform any automatic functions, and it does not increase a rifles rate of fire. 

The SSAR-15 is a rifle stock, and the muscular application of force to create forward movement of the firearm defines the will of the shooter to discharge each individual round of ammunition. Each discharge requires a separate decision by the operator to move the firearm back to a firing condition. With the SSAR-15 installed the firearm is still dependent on an actively engaged operator at all times. If the operator ceases to apply sufficient effort to move the firearm back to a firing condition the firearm will immediately cease operating.

I have had this gun for over 10 years now. This is a very nice gun for being 30 years old, bluing is great and has nice wood on it. The S/N# is 182-69***. This one does not have the ""Ranch Rifle"" marked on the top behind the back sight like the newer ones.

   In the past 10 years it has not had over 50 rounds through it. I am looking for a nice Semi-Auto hand gun. Please don't ask me if I would trade a Hi-point even. Not saying anything wrong with them, but I just don't like them myself."

The Superior II is a very accurate rifle and this one is no exception. The wooden stock on this rifle is one of the nicest, non-custom stocks I've seen. The finish is beautiful and the hand checkering is very crisp. The rifle has a Centerpoint lighted reticle scope on it that works well with the gun."

Both guns are made in Hungary by the FEGARMY Arms factory (formerly known as Fegyver es Gazkeszuelekgyara NV). The P9R uses the modified P9 frame and action, but the classic FN GP-35 Single Action trigger system is replaced with Smith&Wesson-style Double Action system. In Europe the FEG P9R was also known as the Mauser 90DA, as it was imported and distributed through the famous German Mauser organization. The P9R is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. The barrel is operated using a Browning cam system, and is locked to slide by three locking lugs on the top of the barrel, which fit into mated recesses on the inside of the slide, just ahead of the ejection port. Frame and slide are made from carbon steel and usually have blued finish. The Double Action trigger system with external hammer has a slide-mounted safety lever, which also works as a decocker when safety is engaged. On all P9R series pistols the front sight is permanently fixed to the slide, while rear sight is dovetailed. Parts kit includes: pair factory wood grips (no cracks, a few minor surface dings, right grip has a missing piece), 2 grip screws, Magazine release, hammer, hammer pivot pin, trigger. Trigger pivot pin, rear sight, safety/decocker, mainspring housing, and many more including pins & springs for a TOTAL of 30 pieces!  Payment by money order, cashiers check or PayPal on this item.

Would also be interested in a trade toward a Para Warthog .45 or other, similar, .45 doublestack subcompact carry (e.g. Glock, FN) - no more than $350 cash on my end for the right weapon.

Not really interested in other subcompacts unless they are in .45 and of higher quality - sorry, no XDs, Rugers, S&Ws etc...just not my thing.

I also have Liberty Safe Interior light kits for $45.
Prefer CASH But will accept CC with a 3% fee
If you want any information about liberty safes, go to their website. It gives all the stuff about fire rating, gun capacity, weights, dimensions, etc etc

Right off the bat, I'll tell you that you can go on to Wicked Laser's website right now and order this very laser for $299.99. However, I won't take anything close to that. The FDA (yes FDA) has put an import ban on any handheld laser above 5mw. This particular laser is 200x more powerful then what current import allows. Actually getting your hands on one of these is VERY diffcult. I'm a GM for UPS and even with my connections in customs, it still took me 6 1/2 months to get a hold of mine. From what I'm told 85% of these are seized.

However, once you DO have one, they are pretty incredible. It will burn or melt most things dark colored. You can cut through plastics, light cigs, pop ballons, start fires, etc. The beam is so powerful that if you pointed it straight up in the air, no only can you see the beam the entire way up, but the only reason it doesn't hit outter space is because our inner atmosphere diffuses the beam. If you were at sea, and pointed the beam straight out infront of you, the only reason you aren't able to see it past a certain point is because of the curvature of the Earth.

Must have nightsites and atleast two highcap mags. If you have the same gun in a 40 with a conversion 357 barrel that will be fine also. I prefer the non railed version but will concider a railed gun. I prefer all black but a two tone is not out of the question. Iam not looking for 229 in 9mm or 226 in 357. This is going to be my primary duty weapon so iam trying to get what specificly iam looking for. If i find the right sig according to my specifications listed above a possible even trade could be done. Please dont offer an old sig that was a truck gun please. I have been getting those all day. Iam looking for a new or like new weapon..thanks popo

PLease read the following as I have had several e-mails from idiots trying to get the rifle for nothing, or several other silly things.  I am flexible on the price, but do not need your theory as to why I should sell it to you for half price.  The only thing that should be in your e-mail is if you want it or not and relevant questions.  Anything else is irrelevant.  I will not deliver the rifle, this is not a pizza.  And like the pizza people, I am sure not delivering it an hour away.  NO shipping.  If you are not allowed to purchase weapons, please do not contact me.  I will require a bill of sale and want to see some valid state ID.  This all seems like it should be common sense to me, but you would not believe the stupid crap that has come up.  Oh, if you are overly sensitive and have lots of feelings, please do not contact me.  I will answer your questions in a straight forward fashion with little frills, won't get into any debates as to your reasons why I should do it your way.  I am about an inch away from refusing to sell to anyone in the Loveland/longmont area as that seems to be where the goofballs are e-mailing from.  SO please, only normal guys contact me (women too).  Just no cheap whiny time wasters.  I thought that this site would not be like craigslist, but so far it has.

I can send some photos of the rest of the accessories as well, the site seems to only allow 3 pics.  I do not want to separate out the stuff either.  For similar reasons  to the ones listed above, I do not want to have to deal with sale after sale after sale.  The bag is a 175 dollar bag, the accessories are worth well over a couple hundred, so it is a deal.  Let me know if you are interested."

I know you've heard of Ruger M77 Hawkey, but probably not of the new 6.5 Creedmoor cartridge.  It is a centerfire rifle cartridge introduced by Hornady in 2007. When loaded with heavier bullets, cartridges such as the 6.5x55 and 6.5-284 are capable of greater muzzle velocity due to their longer cases and larger powder capacity. 
6.5 mm (.264"") bullets, in general, are known for their relatively high ballistic coefficients, and have seen success in rifle competition. The 6.5 Creedmoor is capable of duplicating the trajectory of the .300 Winchester Magnum while generating significantly lower recoil. 

This Ruger M77 Hawkeye 6.5 Creedmoor is the classically styled, bolt-action rifle with barrel and receiver in Hawkeye Satin Blued finish, and a slim, rounded profile American Walnut stock with satin finish and extensive cut-checkered grip and wrap-around checkered forend.

It has mounted the Nikon Prostaff which is an excellent scope, and mounts low to the bore and still lets in plenty of light. 
The Ruger Mark II Rifle is an accurate, reliable, and easy to shoot rifle. It is built to deliver at the target range, and doubles as a good hunting rifle for limited applications. Like all Ruger firearms, it is built from quality materials, is affordable, and built in the USA.
Included four boxes of ammo, 200 bullets for loading, and new Hornady Custom- Grade Dies."
