Need to try to keep it FTF as i have a rough schedule to try to  ship....nor do i really like the idea if i can help it

Very low round count
excellent condition.  especially considering its age.  it is the Tank of AK 47's

If you don't know what a Mitchell Arms import is then i can tell your not likely going to be interested in this trade.
The Rifle is not a Century arms or kit build, But rather a True Yugoslavian ZASTAVA KRAGUJEVAC build and imported by Mitchell arms. 
the rifles were caught at importation during the asault weapons ban.   400 made it through, and 1000 underfolders were stopped.   this is a one  of the 1000.  it got its bayonet lug clipped and slant brake pinned, then was released for sale.    
the finish, unlike the century guns, is Blued.   the rifles Mitchell imported did NOT come with grenade sights.   the teak furniture new and not mil surplus.  Sadly the original box and Mitchell ""certificate"" are lost by the previious owner

Many of the M90's had their night sights removed.   this one came through unscathed.

standard stock M90's have been selling around 1500 dollars. the ones on Gunbroker and on gunsamerica are listed higher   certainly i value this underfolder higher seeing there were 2500 standard stock rifles, not that they will sell for that (although one recently did at 1495.). but as since i am not lreallt ooking to sell, i am basing trade value upon that.








Iv'e gotten many trade offers and almost have taken many.    but when it comes down to it, i know a MSAR E4 is what i really want."

Overview:
Its solid, ultra-dependable action makes it America’s favorite. If you could throw the lid off every duck blind, stop by every pheasant field and check out every tract of timber where deer and turkey are hunted, you’d probably see more Model 870™ Express® pumps than any other shotgun. It’s been the standard for slide-action performance for more than 50 years.
Its versatility, reliability and uncompromising quality make the Model 870 Express a shotgun you can’t afford to be without. We’re proud to make them, but even prouder of the fact you’ve made them America’s Pump Guns."

It's now called the ""Enhanced Elite"".  This pistol was made in Sept. of 2010.  It's had about 200 rounds fired through it.  It is a beautiful pistol, & deadly accurate.  It has a factory short trigger, a factory short reset trigger, factory Sig tritium night sights, & the newest ergonomic grip design with a smaller circumference & a reduced trigger reach for DA mode.  It is about the same reach as a S&W M&P with a medium grip, or a 1911 with Hogue grips on it.  It isn't a midget's gun.  It includes all the books, the box, lock, take down/cleaning tool, both 15 round factory mags, an aftermarket MecGar 18 round mag (MecGar makes all the factory mags for Sig, Browning, Beretta, etc. They are a much higher quality than promags), a Gould & Goodrich leather paddle holster w/ a covered trigger guard & a leather belt slide holster.  I really like this gun, but I don't want to ding it up dragging it back & forth to the range.

The PLR-22 operate by blowback action and have a 4140 steel bolt that rides on steel guide rails inside the polymer receiver. The ejector is attached to one of the guide rails and the recoil spring is located above the barrel. The cross-bolt safety and magazine release operate identically to the PLR-16. The PLR-22 will accept many of the same accessories as the PLR-16 and SU-16 including the slings, stocks, and compact forend. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and the front sight is adjustable for elevation. An integrated picatinny rail on top will accept a multitude of sighting options. The muzzle end of the barrel is threaded ½""-28 to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake. A 26 round semi-transparent magazine is included and it will accept magazines designed for the Atchison M-16 conversion.

It is all matching numbers, fired very little.  has very little mag wobble, in fact the least amount of mag wobble ive ever felt on an AK.    It has the Tapco SAW style pistol grip on it that has internal storage.  It has good looking wood on it.  its all straight,no cants.  It has the cleaning rod but it doesnt have the cleaning/tool kit in the buttstock, though it does have the trapdoor for it.  I have multiple AKs and want an AR15, i would prefer one with an 18"" barrel or longer, but a 16"" carbine will be considered, also i prefer the A2 butt stock but not a big deal.  Obviously ,it would be for a lower end AR like DPMS or Del-ton or similar.  I would also consider trading for a bolt action rifle chambered in .308 with a synthetic stock, like a Remington 700 or similar.  Will also consider trades for other military style rifles, like a CETME or an FAL copy or something like that, just let em know what you got, but i dont really need any more handguns right now.  I also love old milsurp rifles too, so trade plus cash is a possibility as well.

The base package would include the AK, 3-30 round mags, and 200rounds of ammo.  I value that at $650.  depending on what you have i could include, more mags(up to 5 total), a Korean 75 round drum(unfired) and up to 400rounds of ammo total.  and maybe a soft rifle bag.  im in Warsaw but i can drive to meet someone if its not too far.  let me know if your interested, Thanks

This is an incredibly little pistol. It is as accurate at 7 yards as our 92FS or P229. We have put about 150 rounds through this and never had a single issue, it is superbly built and one of the finest CCW pistols available. The one issue we had was that it would bite a bit into the back of our thumb, so I bought a limbsaver grip wrap (which will be included) and now it is a pleasure to shoot!!!

As mentioned this is near new, we just broke it in with less than three boxes of ammo. This comes with the case, manual, both backstraps, lock etc. This one feature the 7 round magazine, that's critically important since the 6 round mag leaves your pinky floating in space!

Solid, strait frame and sheet metal, it was painted long ago, and looks great from 10 feet. Solid- cast iron 3 speed w/reverse tranny, automotive style clutch, cast iron front axle, tight steering. The Kohler K-161 (7 hp) engine runs great, but smokes a tiny bit at start up and under a heavy load. It really doesn't burn enough oil to be noticed on the dipstick. Dont let the 7hp engine fool you, this thing can pull like you wouldnt believe. One axle seal leaks when it sits for months in the same spot, but only a few drops. Tires are dry cracked but hold air fine, the fronts are different from the ones pictured, I also cleaned it up a bit since the picture was taken a couple years ago (hood, dashtower, frame under sediment bowl, that leaked years ago and stained look much better now)

Great little tractor that can be used as is, cleaned up and painted it would look a million bucks....or turn it into a kick butt puller..it would be the perfect foundation for one. As it sits its safely a $300 IH with no deck, for the right trade (in the $450 range) I'll throw in a nice, solid 38"" or 48"" IH deck and mule drive. I have 7 of these old cubs, and its time to thin down the herd a little. I live in Macedon, NY between Rochester and Syracuse..I can probably deliver this if your close enough, but that can be discussed down the road. Any questions, or if you are really interested and want more pics e-mail me, I'm sure I left a few things out, but hit me up if you want any more info....thanks"

It is all matching numbers, fired very little. has very little mag wobble, in fact the least amount of mag wobble ive ever felt on an AK. It has the Tapco SAW style pistol grip on it that has internal storage. It has good looking wood on it. its all straight,no cants. It has the cleaning rod but it doesnt have the cleaning/tool kit in the buttstock, though it does have the trapdoor for it. I have multiple AKs and want an AR15, i would prefer one with an 18"" barrel or longer, but a 16"" carbine will be considered, also i prefer the A2 butt stock but not a big deal. Obviously ,it would be for a lower end AR like DPMS or Del-ton or similar.  I will only trade for what i have listed, i will NOT sell it.


The base package would include the AK, 3-30 round mags, and 200rounds of ammo. I value that at $650. depending on what you have i could include, more mags(up to 5 total), a Korean 75 round drum(unfired) and up to 400rounds of ammo total. and maybe a soft rifle bag. im in Warsaw but i can drive to meet someone if its not too far. let me know if your interested, Thanks
