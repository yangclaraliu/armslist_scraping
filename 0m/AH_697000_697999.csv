Basically, it is a light recoiling version of the Makarov.

Very few of these pistols were imported into the US.  DA trigger pull is smooth and light.  SA trigger pull breaks like glass.  8+1 capacity.  Can be rapidfired very accurately.  I was getting tight groupings at 30 feet.

As long as you run European ammo through it, it will run flawlessly.  I fired 50 rounds of Fiocchi without a single jam.  This is a very pleasant pistol to shoot.  Not the typical Mil-Surp crap with horrendous trigger pulls and numerous issues.  This is a flawless shooter.

With Fiocchi FMJ, energy and penetration is similar to the .380 with much less recoil due to the 3"" barrel.  Lightweight alloy frame lends itself well to carry in a jacket pocket.  9 accurate shots as fast as you can pull the trigger.  Slide locks back when mag is empty.  Safety/decocker switch.  Walther style hammer.  Very comfortable German style grips.  No importer marks.  This is a lot better than a KelTec or a Bersa and less expensive.  I have owned several SIG P230s and this compares very favorably to them.

Comes with an extra magazine and over 100 rounds of Fiocchi ammo.

The only issue with this gun is the prior owner Duracoated it Army olive drab.  Looks fine, but there is a little wear at the ejection port and muzzle.

The only reason I'm selling this is because I prefer revolvers and am funding another purchase.

Price is pretty firm unless you have .44 Special or .22 WRF (not WMR) ammo to swap.  Not interested in trades unless you have a steel frame, 5-shot, snub .38 (Charter Arms, Rossi, Taurus).

Asking only $200 CASH for the pistol, 2 mags, and 100+ rds of ammo.

Zeiss Victory FL binoculars are some of the world’s finest optics but many people are unaware that they are available in a 56-mm size. The 8x56 Zeiss Victory FL binocular provides the most light-gathering and throughput possible, and are the best choice for near-dark viewing conditions. Made with the same high-tech glass and coatings as the smaller Zeiss Victory binoculars, the 8x56 FL yields bright and vivid images when it’s too dark for anything else. The LotuTec coating increases the rate at which the 8x56 Zeiss Victory FL binoculars shed water, meaning a clearer view for you in rain or heavy fog. These large objective lenses of the 56-mm Zeiss Victory binoculars also make them superior for viewing stars and planets."

Is all stock except renthal bars, cooler rack and dg front bumper, and bark busters. It has a new axle carrier installed and new brakes in the box not installed yet (still stops great pads are a bit thin). I know the owners very well back to its purchase new, so i know the history well. it has never been raced, jumped, or on a track, so the shocks, frame, engine etc are still in great shape for the year model. It was mostly used on trails and back roads. This price is WAAAY below book value. I bought this from a friend who needed money and I just want to get my money back or a nice trade quickly, so don't wait around or you will miss this opportunity! Rather trade??? Im Also looking for a similar year waverunner, kids Polaris rzr 170, maybe an old jeep or car that gets good gas mileage to drive to work, or possibly high value guns or multiple guns, guns + cash, etc... I do NOT need another racing four wheeler, but may consider a nice 4x4 quad or a youth quad or dirt bike with cash to boot... 

Im ready to move it ASAP! Make me a reasonable cash offer or let me know what you have to trade! Book value for trades is at about $2400-2500 

The only cons, is  it has 2 cheap and easy fix issues that don't stop the bike from being ridden. 1: the steering stem is bent. You can either heat and straighten for free, or buy one from eBay for 30 bucks. 2: the front left wheel is warped. (replacement is about 50 bucks). If I still have it next week, Im going to fix them myself and the price/trade value is going up up up... There are of course normal use scratches and scrapes and dents and dings, this is a 2004 model that is used after all! Overall though its great!

The 517.A65 was developed to optimize the functionality of the HWS. The buttons have been moved from the back to the left side for instant access, allowing a magnifier or a back up iron sight to fit closely to the HWS body. This new button position allows the user to operate the HWS function switches easier than ever before. Additionally, a portion of the front base has been raised to allow the sight to fit over standard hand guards found on many M-4 or M-16 style weapons

  A True Specimen of the American West. Barrel has some ornate engraving, and what appears to be sterling rings just in front of receiver, and front sight. Engraver is unknown,(Winchester records does not specify engraved, and thus it is assumed done post delivery), & the difference in patena would be attributed to removal of bluing for the engraving, and then re-treated; current finish is aged, but not pitted or damaged. The magazine has beautiful plum like patena. Forearm has a slight crack. The barrel does not have a caliber stamp, because .44-40 was the only caliber available in this rifle until the addition of other calibers in later years.

This is a Star SM Super .380 acp.  It is an all steel copy of the Colt Government .380 and like the Government .380 looks like the Colt 1911 that we all love.  It does not come apart like the Colt, it's a lot easier and requires no tools and much less hand strength.  The Start Super SM gun was manufactured from 1971 to 1983 and I think this is about a 1978 or 1979 model.  The Star has been around since 1948 and the Star SM Super has  some really advanced safety features for the time like you can not pull the trigger with a magazine out of the weapon (Magazine Safety).  This one also has target grips a thumb safety and a slide release much like the 1911.  With a full steel frame and a case hardened hammer the gun has a classic look with classic lines.  As you can see in the pictures this gun has very little wear and you wont see too many like it.  Parts are still available through places like NUMRICH.  This pistol comes with a European PPK style holster w/2nd magazine spot, a second magazine and 35 rounds of plinking ammo.  This is a WONDERFUL gun for the ladies.  It is small enough that it is easy to handle with smaller hands and heavy enough that it does not have a big kick.  This gun just feels really good in your hand!

This pistol has just been completely taken down cleaned oiled and polished.  It is in really nice condition and would make a really nice gift.

The gun fires great, I had a few FTEs and stovepipes but I blame that on leftover preservative grease inside the piston system and a sticky chamber. I cleaned it thoroughly again I just haven't gotten a chance to fire the rifle again.

IT WOULD BE MONUMENTALLY WISE TO NOT HAVE ANYTHING RESTRICTING YOU FROM ""LEGALLY"" OWNING THIS, INCLUDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.   I WOULD LIKE AN HONEST, LEGAL DEAL AND NOT HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONFISCATED BECAUSE SOMETHING RESTRICTING YOU FROM OWNING THIS WAS FOUND AFTER THE FACT.  
AN ARREST WOULD THEN BE EMINENT AND MANDATORY.  THE PISTOL WOULD BE CONFISCATED AND BOND WOULD NEED TO BE POSTED.  
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.  
JUST A FEW WORDS TO THE WISE, BECAUSE I LIKE TO BE UP-FRONT AND DON'T WISH TROUBLE UPON ANY LAW ABIDING CITIZEN, WHO IS LEGALLY EXERCISING THEIR 2nd AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

I AM NOT DESPERATE TO SELL ANYTHING.

ASKING PRICE IS $600.00 FOR EVERYTHING.  IF YOU LIKE IT BETTER, I'LL ""ASK"" $750.00, SO YOU CAN GET ME DOWN TO THE $600.00  IT WILL COST.

The gun is in excellent condition, I can honestly only think of maybe 3-4 times where we went to shoot it. The rifling in the barrel could pass as factory new, there still is some of the residue left in the crevices when you get a new firearm (I cleaned it thoroughly with Frog Lube also) but essentially you are getting a gun that hasn't even been broke in yet for less than the dealers cost.

 * Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
 * The bolt of the VZ 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
 * The VZ 58 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
 * The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ 58.
 * The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ 58.
 * The VZ 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. 
* The alloy magazine of the VZ 58 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lb. vs. .84 lb.)
 * VZ 58 is easier to field strip.
 * The VZ 58 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47.

I am very firm at $500.  That is for a brand new in the box gun.  If used but like new, the price is $450 firm.  Prices for additional accessories that may come with the gun are as follows: additional magazines are $20 for 7 round, $25 for 8 round with extension, holsters vary depending on what it may be(I might not even want it), ammo $10/box of 50 general range ammo and $.50/round if it's good defense ammo (all ammo prices depend on quantity and type), Crimson Trace laser $150.  If there's anything else then inform me what it is, details help, and it may or may not be worth something to me.  So all said, what's listed is what I am willing to pay.  

Honestly, I am looking for just a plain from the factory gun that's brand new in the box with the paper work and the factory 7 and 8 round magazines it comes with...which means regardless of what you might have, I may only be interested in the gun only or nothing at all even.

I am willing to meet face to face in a public location, like a Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Kroger, etc. parking lot.  The location should be in the vicinity of Southwest-Southeast 270 (like Grove City, Georgesville, Hillard, or Renoyldsburg areas).  I would also consider Circleville area, even towards Lancaster.  Thought much outside of Grove City to Circleville area and the price starts falling (I work a lot and am paid hourly, also get 10mpg...both add up fast). 

Offer what you want to me, the worst I can say is no...but I think I have it pretty well listed here.  Thanks!"

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.
