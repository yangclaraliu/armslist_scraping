Sig Sauer P230, this is a very clean all stainless ccw, very good looking comfortable gun, as accurate as anything Ive ever shot.

These are two great pistols. Im just looking to downsize the types of ammo I need to buy/reload.

Make: Shiloh Sharps (Farmingdale NY)

Model: Model 1874 Business Rifle

Serial Number: 3842

Year of Manufacture: Ca. 1980's, 1990's

Caliber: .45-110 WCF, .45 2 7/8""

Action Type: Single Shot, Falling Block

Markings: The top of the barrel is marked ""Old Reliable / Shiloh Rifle Mfg. Co. / Caliber 45 / 2 7/8"". The left side of the frame is marked ""Shiloh rifle Mfg. Co. / Farmingdale N.Y."". The top of the frame is marked ""3842"".

Barrel Length: 30""

Sights / Optics: This rifle is mounted with a dovetail set front blade, and a screwed on two position sliding rear ladder flip sight. The upper tang is drilled and tapped for a tang sight.

Stock Configuration & Condition: The stocks are oil finished smooth wood. There is an imperfection at the underside of the forearm, at the right side and near the tip. The upper edges of the forearm also show wear and depressions. Most of the stock wear is at the toe and there is scattered dings and marks elsewhere on the stock. The LOP measures about 13 3/4"" to the front trigger. The stocks rate in about Fine overall condition.

Type of Finish: Blue / Case Color Hardened

Mechanics: The action functions as designed, as do the set triggers. We have not fired this rifle.

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: None

Our Assessment: This is a relatively rare Shiloh Sharps (.45-110) in very nice condition - with a great bore. This is the ultimate long range sharps rifle, and very few modern made guns have risen to the status of collectibilty as Shiloh's ever have. For cowboy action long range shooting, for western re-enactments, for playing Quigley, or for an investment, this rifle is the tops. Shiloh quality is legendary - especiall the Farmingdale guns. There is a long wait on new Shilohs. Don’t let this beautiful rifle get away."

Smith & Wesson combined a Scandium alloy frame to build the strongest, and lightest weight .357 Magnum revolver made. The result is maximum power in a small, lightweight, easy-to-carry package. Scandium alloy is used for small, medium, and large frame revolvers. Smith & Wesson's lightest and strongest revolvers deliver dependable power every time.

I purchased this firearm new from dealer about a month ago for concealed carry. I've now decided I want an FNP-45 Tactical with Trijicon RMR and SilencerCo Osprey suppressor, which will run me $2,500-3,000. I already have too many carry guns so this one's gotta go to help get down the cost of my new tactical .45 investment.

This is an excellent firearm, great for carry and packs a hell of a punch! I've only had it at the range a couple times (50-60 rounds maybe, factory only, no hand loads). This gun is not even broke in yet and will continue to fire tens of thousands of more rounds before any maintenance will need to be done. You also will enjoy the flexibility of being able to shoot a small .38 caliber with much more manageable recoil. You can essentially fire 3 calibers in one gun by selecting to use .38, .38 +P, or the devastating .357 Magnum.

It's hard to beat the stopping power of the .357 magnum, especially when running critical defense hollow points. A revolver will never let you down. No jamming to worry about or cycling a semi automatic action in case of a bad round/ftf. When my life is depending on it, I only carry revolvers for this reason. When the adrenaline hits and fine motor control drops out, all you have to worry about is focusing on the front sight and pulling the trigger.

Comes in original hard case, with all factory accessories, factory test rounds, gun lock and I even have the original grips if you don't like the Crimson Trace Lasergrips or desire the smaller footprint you get from the original grips. This is a $1,129.00 value direct from S&W (approx. $1,215.93 after tax), and for only $850.00 you are getting it at less than 70% the retail price after tax for a gun that is in better than 90% condition.

I am willing to accommodate out of state sales/transfers for the cost of shipping, whatever that ends up being. Why buy from the dealer for more when you can get a like-new gun for way less! Take advantage of this great deal before somebody else does first!"

Model number SA58C18RL. I purchased this rifle this year, and it has had 260 rounds through it. I broke in the barrel according to DSA’s website. This rifle is in excellent condition, and has been cleaned after every trip to the range. The only signs of wear are where the optics are mounted and around the ejection port which is typical for this type of firearm. I have been around quite a few FAL’s which why I got this beast.  Unless you spend the money for an all original  pre-ban or a custom build, this is the best FAL on the market.  The fit and finish of the DSA is second to none. This is truly an awesome rifle, and the FAL is a battle proven platform. I hate to part with it but I have other financial interest that takes precedence at this point.

This is DSA’s 18” Carbine. It has the Type II receiver. It had the Extreme Duty Scope Mount Factory installed. I also had the full length rail interface installed so there is a continuous rail the length of the rifle along with rails on the fore grip at 9:00, 3:00, and 6:00. A couple of other Items I purchased from DSA were the extended selector switch, which makes going from “fire” mode to “safe” mode reachable with your thumb, and the ERGO HK G3 style tactical sure grip which is basically a Hogue type grip. I replaced the stock Belgium type short flash hider with a Primary Weapons Systems FSC FAL which is a dual flash suppressor and compensator muzzle device. I purchased and installed a extended magazine catch from Arizona response System, which allows for easier magazine changes. I also have one of DSA’s standard molded front fore grips that I added a swivel sling mount to. Also included in the sale are all of the original parts that I replaced so the rifle can be put back to it stock configuration if desired.

So in this sale the buyer will receive; 1- DS ARMS SA58 FAL 18” Carbine, with the Extreme Duty Scope Mount, the full length rail interface, the original selector switch, extended selector switch,  the standard FAL pistol grip, tactical sure grip, Belgium short flash hider, PWS FSC FAL muzzle device, standard magazine catch, extended magazine catch, and extra DSA fore grip, one 20 round military surplus magazine, factory sling, factory hard case, original FN FAL manual, and DS ARM’s SA 58 owner’s manual. The optics and bi-pod in the pictures are NOT included in this sale.

This rifle is sold as is, and I cannot offer any warranty once it is paid for and leaves my possession. This will be a CASH ONLY sale. I will not ship this rifle, this will be a face to face sale. I will travel a reasonable distance to meet serious buyers. I will need to see a picture ID and the buyer will need to sign a bill of sale for my personal records.

I really appreciate your interest. If you have an offer, any questions or would like to see more pictures, please reply to this post.

Description off of Sig's website:

""The P239® was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols. ""

This was a factory offering, not a conversion. These guns are rare and hard to find, with only about 1500 produced.

Overall, the gun is in very good condition, with the exception of the front sight ( loose- needs restaking). It includes 3 mags ( the original ODI magazine needs a new spring ). For $425, I will also include a box of ammo- a new box of CorBon powerball ammo ( good defense ammo- reliable feeding) . The gun is a good shooter, and is rare and unique.
This is a commander size pistol w/ a 4.25"" barrel and mil-spec sights.

It is a 2000 Toyota Tacoma Pre-Runner, so it is 2wd with the stock Toyota 4x4 suspension, wheels and tires. The truck runs awesome and is in very good condition for the age. I have mainly used it like a car and not for hauling stuff like a truck is meant to be used. It has a plastic bed liner and I have a hard locking tonneau cover with keys, I just do not have it installed currently.
I recently put new speakers in the front and back of the truck as well as a new pioneer cd player.
The tires are in good shape and have around 65% tread left on them.
This truck has the 2.7 liter engine with an automatic transmission.
I get on average 21MPG on the highway and about 18MPG in town.
The truck does not have power windows or locks but it does have tilt steering wheel and a sliding rear window.
Clean carfax, never been in an accident and up to date on maintenance.
Th truck is a great little truck in good condition all around and will make someone very happy.
I have looked for other Tacoma's in this condition and they seem to be difficult to find especially with lower miles like this one has. Insurance runs me 21.00 per month so it is pretty cheap to insure

The truck is white exterior and a tan cloth interior.
Everything works on the truck and there are no issues.
IF you would like to look at it please let me know.

I am not really looking for trades but if something catches my eye I am open to it. Mainly would be interested in 4x4 full sized trucks, 4 door cars that are fun to drive, possibly motorcycles with cash on the other end (nothing fancy) and possibly things that go bang with money on other end as well.
If you have something you think I would possible like please let me know, worst I can say is no.

The truck will be going in for a full detail this week sometime so when it is sold it will be fully detailed inside and out."

This BMW is a mono-shock R80 so it is a single sided swing arm with the drive-shaft not a chain drive. It is very unique and rides excellent

I stripped the bike to just the engine and frame, I sent the tank, tail, fender and side covers off for a custom paint job. The pictures do no justice for paint, it is a custom gold with lots of pearl that really shows in the sunlight!
The frame was stripped to metal and repainted black with plenty of clear to make it really shine.
I cleaned the engine and drive-train and painted it with high temp engine paint.
The original tail light and signals were ditched for low profile signals and the tail light is off a 2008 Honda cbr 600rr, it is led and extremely bright.
The original handlebars were very tall and slightly bent so I replaced them with a set of black drag bars.
The original speedo and tach were not functional, I replaced them with a digital Acewell cluster that compliments the bike very well.
I replaced the exhaust with a single exit MAC full exhaust system that retains the center stand as well as the side stand!
It has brand new tires front and rear that have maybe 100 miles on them.
I have 2 seats one reupholstered in black and the other is an orange color needing to be recovered.
I replaced the restrictive intake box with 2 better flowing k&n cone filters.

There is so much that has been done to this bike, it is beautiful and I would prefer to keep it but I have not been able to work on it or ride it for over a year and I hate to see it just sitting in the garage not being appreciated like it should.
With the new intake system and exhaust I would suggest re-jetting the bike, I just have not had the ability to do so since I started my new job.
whoever gets this bike will for sure enjoy every second of it.

please email me with any questions or to set up a time to come see the bike.
No test rides without cash in my hand and a motorcycle endorsement on your license.

This is the special ""Long-Action"" version of the Browning Lever-guns. It is chambered for the Springfield 30-06 caliber--the all-time standard hunting round in the USA. To say this is a beautiful rifle is a major understatement. Browning has been building strong and good looking hunting lever-actions for a hundred plus years and know what they are doing with each model.

This rifle has a 22 inch barrel, detachable 4 round box magazine plus one in the chamber, a high gloss finish, and impeccable metal and bluing. It is tapped for a scope, but no optics are on the gun at this time. The balance and feel of this rifle are the finest quality I have ever seen.

Firearms of this quality don't come cheap, but if you want one of the finest of John Browning's collection of great hunting guns, this one can be for you. Price is $799, cash, trade or combination of the two. No shotguns or junk guns considered, otherwise make me an offer and let's see what you've got.
