After a lot of mulling, I've decided to part with my S&W 3913.  As warm weather approaches, this is a great opportunity to pick up a fantastic, easily concealable handgun for warm weather carry!

So up for trade is an early 1990s S&W 3913 in good shape.  No MIM parts.  Green Meprolight night sights with plenty of life left in them, installed about 1.5 years ago.  Normal wear on the barrel and rails, with some scuffs on the beavertail and light wear around the edge of the grips.  Has functioned flawlessly over a couple thousand rounds.

-Crossbreed IWB magazine holder with horsehide and J clip (design now discontinued)
-Lobo Gunleather Model 1-SL with custom thumb break, black, 1.5 loops
-Galco double magazine holder with snap belt loop, black
-Ted Blocker B5 belt slide, tan 
-Wild Bill's Fusion Paddle with matching clip-on single magazine holder, brown
-Galco FLETCH, tan
-Desantis Nemesis pocket holster (the 3913 actually carries well in the front pocket of cargo/tactical pants!)
-Hogue rubber grips (installed) as well as factory plastic grips
-Standard factory sights in Meprolight night sight package
-5 factory 8 round stainless 39XX magazines (2 flat floorplates, 3 finger grip)

No box, but will include generic plastic case.


For trade, I'm interested in acquiring an entry/mid-level AR-15 or mid-level AK-47/AK-74 (i.e. No WASRs!).  Preferences are listed below, but are not set in stone.

AK Preferences:
-Chrome lined bore
-Wood furniture (but not opposed to quality polymer)

It shoots the cheap 7.62x25mm cartridge.  Just some numbers, it's roughly 10 cents per round.  The round's velocity is approximately 1350fps to as much as 1600+ fps.  They are very fast for a handgun.  I am looking for $300 out of it.  I have replaced the barrel, firing pin, and lock rollers.  All three of these are brand new parts.  I still have the old barrel, firing pin, and lock rollers that will come with the gun that will be given to the buyer.  It has one magazine.  I also have a box of 72 rounds of Romanian mil-surp ammo that I will include as well.  No holster or other accessories included other than what I have listed above.  I can be contacted via the email link below.  It was arsenal refurbished twice from what I can tell (1978 and 1986) and there is a very slight import mark (NHM CO. SAC CA), you can hardly tell it is an import mark.  Definitely not an annoying ""billboard"" on the side of the slide like other CZ's have.  

I'm asking $300 because stock I feel it is worth $250 because of the condition it is in.  The brand new barrel (never been fired), hardened lock rollers, and hardened firing pin are well worth over $75.  Ammo is worth $8.  None of that includes shipping costs that I paid, the total tally would be around $335, so I think $300 is more than fair.

models and the full size models.  I like it because the full size frame fits my hand, but the shortened barrel make it not a giant firearm to aim.  Anyway, it's definitely had rounds through it and has 

been to the range a few times.  I've never had it jam, misfeed or misfire and have always shot quality Winchester ammo through it.

Along with the firearm itself I'm including:

5 Magazines
- 2 Beretta Factory 10 round
- 1 Beretta Factory 15 round
- 2 Aftermarket 15 round

440 rounds of 9mm ammunition
- 40 rounds of Speer Gold Dot Personal Defense (hollows)
- 100 rounds of Winchester Personal Defense (hollows)
- 300 rounds of Winchester Target Ball Ammo (full metal jacket)

Hoppe's #9 Solvent
Hoppe's Spray Lubricant
Hoppe's Lubricating oil
A Hoppe's 9mm boresnake (unused)
A shit ton of patches
A compact cleaning kit made for pistols
An extra cleaning rod and spare attachements
An Uncle Mike's hardshell retention holster
An unused pistol cleaning mat from Cabela's

I'm really needing $700 for the pistol and all the goodies that come with it.

I hate to part with it but I have to come up with some cash this week pronto.

Also, this pistol is 100% legal, but completely off the radar.  It's never been purchased or sold through an FFL dealer and all transactions on it have come through private party sales.  In other words, if you are worried about the current administration and gun rights . . . this is the pistol you want to buy.

Please reply via email or text directly to REDACTED

This is a private party transfer of a firearm.  Any buyer would need to show State ID proving they are over 21 years of age.  Buyer must also be legally able to own a firearm."

Comes apart like an AR15 but, has parts like a blowback operation carbine. 
This throws 9mm bullets down the rifled bore like a champ, hitting high velocity for a 9mm. Low round count. Gun is Complete Bushmaster, not a pieced together AR

TRADE- FOR AN AR15 type Rifle, Brand does not really matter, .223 or 308
DPMS, Bushmaster, Colt, Double Star, Armalite, ETC!!.. PLEASE, IF YOU OFFER AN OLYMPIC, THEY ARE BRAND NEW at Bradis for 599.99. I am looking for a varmiter-
AR's only.. NO AK's or Calvary Arms AR's nothing else... Please include ammo with your trade or boot!

Don't underestimate the strength of Carbon Fiber- The gun weighs close to 6lbs, and they use Carbon Fiber sythetic in combat jets and Indy Cars. The main body of an Indy car is mainly carbon fiber... amazing how it stays intact with a direct hit with a wall at 220mph!"

I have owned the gun for 8 years and never had a problem with it. I shot trap and sporting clays with it for about 5 years. A shoulder injury forced me to stop shooting 3 years ago so i'm selling all my shooting stuff. This and my reloader are about the only thing i have left. I just have to realize i cant do it anymore and get rid of the things that remind me of that fact. So my ""lose"" is your gain so to speak. I paid way more than my asking price for this great gun.

Heres why, I recently obtained this Gun as trade fodder hoping to trade for another Glock or high quality used semi-auto. I purported the value to be much greater than it actually was. I had no idea of this error when I made the post, as the gentleman I got it from told me he thought it was made in 1972. I recieved an e-mail this morning from a very upset reader and my first reaction was not good. After taking the gun to several local gun shops I learned a couple of things from educated gun dealers. #1 the gun was probaly made in the early to mid ninety's. #2 The gun is in their opinion in uncommonly great shape and probably has not had very many(if any) high pressure rounds fired through it. #3 Revovlers of this grade are hard to find right now. So heres the deal, I will take the first offer I get for either a name brand semi-auto in decent shape or $500, whichever comes first. If not I'll set on it till I'm an old man and will it to my son, as I dont ""need"" the money. I just like to trade and have done so many times on this forum.
     That being said, I'm sorry that I offended the reader who offered $341 for it and welcome any more advice, just try not to use so many cuss words next time:-)Lastly all the guy's who think they can get one like this for $450 on gunbroker,be advised with my gun you get to see & feel it in person and not have to pay any shipping fees or taxs and not have to be on the gun grab list-Peace

I bought it from a friend, a pilot, who was issued the same gun shortly after he'd purchased this one.  He'd put perhaps 1/2 box of ammo through it.  I've since put....300 rounds through it I suppose.  Comes with 3 factory magazines (about $50 each) and a Blackhawk Serpa holster (another $50).  I can send pictures, I've just been too lazy to bring the camera out.  Absolutely flawless gun.  Runs like a sewing machine, never had a failure.  I'm selling because I'm just a 45 guy.  I've tried 2 different 40's and I'm going back to 1911's.  At present I need to give it a quick cleaning.

As a side note, I have approximately 1000 rounds of factory ammo, mostly American Eagle 40 cal. 180 grain FMJ ammo that I will also be selling.  A couple of boxes of Remington & Magtech in there as well.  I haven't determined a price but will definitely consider a good deal for the entire package.

Oh yeah.  This gun has the LE trigger, no safety.  TruDot night sites (another $100).  I would consider it 95%, primarily due to amount of ammo run through it.  No holster wear, etc.  Comes with the original case.  I don't have the manuel for it but that's easily down loaded from the web.  What can I say?  It's the best built gun that I have but....I'm not a 40 guy.

This is the ""Convertible"" 9mm Luger CYLINDER ONLY that fits a Ruger Blackhawk 357 NEW MODEL. This is NOT a complete firearm. It is a really cost effective way of being able to shoot a very inexpensive round (the 9mm luger) out of your blackhawk. If your like me, its just a lot of fun to shoot a revolver, but .357 or .38 ammo either one is way too expensive to paper punch very much. All you do is pull your .357 mag cyl out and drop this in and fire away. Thats it. No ""moon clips"" required or anything. The 9mm and .38/.357 have the same bore for the barrel, so there is no change required other than swapping cylinders. I bought it for a blackhawk i had one time, but mine was an older ""3 screw"" modes and this WILL NOT FIT the older (60's era) Blackhawks. I dropped it into my buddies new model and it fit perfectly and the action cycled flawlessly. I have not shot any rounds through it, and it looks like the previous owner didn't either. It looks new, but I can't guarentee it to be unfired. I don't mind shipping, because as I understand the law, this is a part, not a firearm; thus it doesn't have to go through an FFL. I prefer to meet someone local, but I can ship at buyer's expense. Feel free to call or text to REDACTED. Email also works. I can send pics if necessary, but if you got a Blackhawk, you know what a cylinder looks like. ;) Asking $90 obo or possible trade for nice sig night sights or some 9mm or .45acp ammo, or other gun stuff.

This shotgun was manufactured between 1922 ~ 1930
It is an older shotgun and the metal has some ""etch"" work along the sightline down the barrel, that really helps define this firearm. Metal has smooth even patina finish; wood is great! Only one tiny crack that's barely visible. 
When I contacted Marlin to gather info on this shotgun they told me I should NOT fire MAGNUM or HI-POWER steel loads. But with standard 2 3/4 LEAD BIRD-SHOT I would be fine.

This piece is in extremely good to excellent condition. IT'S BEEN INSPECTED BY A GUNSMITH."

here is a part of one email he sent(this rifle is all original its never been threw a rebuild the book value is 2200 I don't expect to get top dollar for it and I'm not going to give it away for 400 I will take trades and or cash what are you willing to do)the gun is pretty clean but its got a m2 stock with rra (red river arsional) first indication,adjustable post war sight second indication,bayonet lug third indication,sg marked recoil plate forth indication.finally broke it down and what do you know trigger housing reparkerized and pitted so bad cant even tell what the maker is,new springs its a total mismatch.
being a pistol collector i knew nothing about m1 carbines and took his word for it.
ten minits after he left my house i knew i was scamed.i emailed him and he never responded.its been about 2 weeks since i got it. so i decided to warn other armslist users in our area to beaware of this guy.dont let him get you.and gary if you are reading this thank you very much.you are the most dishonest person that ever crossed my door step.is it tough looking over your shoulder everywere you go or just natural ,this is not spam this is a caution to those of you that use arms list."

(Below is the description off the website)
M33 Handguard 
Built to military specification, the M-33 will fit all M-16/AR15 style carbine rifles. Produced from special high density polymers injected into ultra precision molds, with rails molded directly into the handguards top and bottom halves. The rails will accept any accessory with a Picatinny or Weaver base. Lasers, lights, optics, bi-pods, and other mission specific accessories can be easily mounted on the rails. A sliding cover is provided to protect the rails when not in use and enhance the operator's grip upon the handguards. The use of a stainless steel heat shield within the M-33 handguard acts as a heat sink to dissipate the high temperatures encountered during sustained rapid fire sequences."

The Ruger Mini-14 180 series have a few minor internal and external design changes that make it incompatible with most of the commercial and aftermarket accessories that are specifically made for the later 181 and 182 series rifles.

Ruger also offers a selective fire variant of the Mini-14, the AC-556, to police and military customers. AC-556 models have a slightly longer receiver (shared with early production ""series 180"" models) to allow for full automatic operation.

AC-556 models have a slightly longer receiver (shared with early production ""series 180"" models) to allow for full automatic operation.

24"" Fluted Extra Heavy Barrel in 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber with 11 degree competition crown; heavyweight 1"" diameter under the handguard; custom match hybrid chamber with a tighter SAAMI Spec headspace from the shoulder of the chamber to the bolt face, and longer chamber throat or ""Leade"". This accommodates 5.56mm ammunition without developing higher pressures encountered when firing 5.56mm ammo in a .223 chamber with shorter ""Leade"" (both calibers can be used safely). Rifling is 1 in 9"" twist for optimum performance with most lighter bullet weight varmint cartridges, and the barrel is fluted to increase cooling and reduce weight. The Varminter Upper's shell ejection path has been modified to drop all your brass in the same place as a convenience for the reloader. A vented forend with bipod/sling stud installed, free-floats the barrel from the barrel nut forward and B.M.A.S. Mini-Risers add 1/2"" to scope height for correct sight picture and comfortable cheek weld. This Upper is sold complete with Bolt, Bolt Carrier and Charging Handle to ensure positive lockup between bolt and barrel extension."

This gun started off life as a regular Kahr K40 Covert, with a matte finish and standard black plastic grips. I spent somewhere between 20 and 40 hours removing machining marks, sanding and polishing so that the finish would be nearly mirror-perfect. I had the factory standard sights removed so that I could get the top of the slide nice and flat.

I am proud of how the gun turned out, and call it my K40 Covert ""Elite."" Both the slide and frame have been polished, although there are a few machining marks that I was unable to remove in the frame. I also polished the slide-stop lever. Based on pictures that I have seen, the polish-job I have done to this pistol far surpasses the Kahr Elite models. The addition of Kahr wood grips really makes for a classy look, and they feel better when gripping the gun.

The gun currently has no sights installed on it, as I have been undecided about which night sights I wanted. I am including a set of factory sights should the new owner decide to install those. The recent purchase of a K40 with a faulty recoil spring had me swapping it out for the good one in this gun, so it will need an $8 spring from Kahr.

3 magazines are included - one flush-mount with a Pearce grip extension, and two extended mags, although one of them fails to lock the slide back. The nub that pushes up the slide stop lever appears to be faulty (Kahr mags are like $50 a pop).

This gun conceals exceptionally well, with the shorter grip of the MK series, but the longer sight radius of the K series. The plastic box and original paperwork are included as well. I would prefer to sell this locally (Twin Cities, MN), but may consider shipping it on the buyer's dime. I am asking $700 for this high-quality firearm. I would consider trades for a Kahr K9, Springfield EMP 9, or Sig Sauer P226 X5 or P226ST (I can add cash as necessary).

I do my very best to accurately represent anything and everything I sell. I want prospective owners to have zero surprises when they receive it, and hope that they would find the item to be in better condition than represented; I prefer to err on the side of caution. I am happy to answer any questions and provide any pictures, just ask."

I used it this past rifle season and took a total of 4 deer, using this rifle and ammo, never had to hit one twice.  I spraypainted the camo stock,  it may sound dumb, but if you've ever seen a factory savage stock,  You'll know a little paint doesn't hurt the value.  If you don't like it, you could always remove the stock and rub it with paint thinner and the paint would come right off without damaging the stock.
