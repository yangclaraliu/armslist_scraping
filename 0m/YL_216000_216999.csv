Also have a folding stock and a dust cover rail not shown both like new. This picture was taken when I completed the conversion, it has since received a fresh coat of paint so the rusty hand guard retainer is taken care of and all the new conversion parts match the old pieces (no plastic was painted, every piece of plastic on the gun is TAPCO so it all matches perfect). As it is fully converted it will accept any AK47 accessories you may want to add, NOT Saiga accessories.

it shoots excellent and is accurate. it has diopter sights that are pretty easy to get a good sight picture. put a good scope on it and it would be a tack driver.

1943 Colt Commercial military 1911A1 S/N 8615XX as described and explained in Both Charles Clawson’s “Collector’s guide to Colt .45 service pistols” and J.C. Harrison’s “U.S. Pistols & Revolvers 1909-1944”. For the avid 1911A1 collector, you know that this is a rare piece as described in Clawson’s book: Beginning in October 1942, the acute need for pistols prompted Colt to transfer 6,575 unsold commercial Government Model automatic pistols to their existing military contract. The existing commercial serial numbers were peened flat on the receiver and under the slide firing pin stop and restamped/renumbered in the military serial number range. All or most of these pistols were originally manufactured wit the Swartz safety. These safeties were removed when the pistol was transferred to the military contract and these “Swartz safety” pistols can be easily identified by a square hole located beside the disconnector cutout in the slide (THIS IS one) Slides retained the original commercial inscriptions . Barrels transferred with these pistols were either “S” (commercial) or “G” (standard military)…(This one contains a “G” barrel - The pistols were parkerized and submitted to Ordnance inspectors for military acceptance. An Ordnance inspection mark (crossed cannons) was stamped on the receivers  W.B. inspectors initials were stamped on a few pistols through S/N 861000 and G.H.D. initials on all others (THIS RECEIVER IS G.H.D. STAMPED – . This particular pistol is in excellent condition inside and out ! Barrel rifling is clear, crisp and shiny"

This unique .44 caliber Schofield is allegedly the only known surviving gun from the West's most famous gunfight: The O.K. Corral. This non-firing replica of the famous .44 caliber Schofield owned by Wyatt Earp is displayed on a handsome wood frame with brass hangars and an identification plaque. Details overlooked in other replicas are not missed in this re-creation, such as a tiny notch in front of the trigger, a subtle short gauge on the barrel, and a missing screw on the butt plate -- every detail of this piece is exactly according to the original..

This elaborately engraved reproduction is sheathed in nickel plate and carries a rugged elegance befitting a professional gambler and gunfighter of the Western Frontier.Gun Overall Length: 13.5"" Gun Weight: 2.5lbs

A master engraver has painstakingly matched every fine line and flourish of the this polished, nickel-plated, antique replica gun's unique scrollwork -- on the barrel, cylinder, hammer, frame, backstrap and triggerguard. With the hammer at half-cock, you can ""break"" the gun open to reload, just as they did in the old days. Thumb up the hatch, swing the frame down on its hinge, and the shell-extractor glides out from the cylinder, retracting again when the gun is fully open. The 8"" barrel worked to the advantage of a marksman, dampening muzzle kick and enhancing accuracy. For fast reloads, the entire frame swings down, revealing all six chambers.

It is serialized and comes with the Certificate of Authenticity.

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Features contrast sights. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. Two finishes are available; Two-tone and corrosion resistant Nitron. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

Comes with everything Ruger includes in the box: soft case, two mags etc.  It has upper and lower rails.  It has less than 200 rounds thru it.  The Bushnell (made by Eotech) Holosight is not included in the price but is for sale separately for $200.  Both prices are firm and less than I paid.  My prices are less than either may be purchased for - anywhere. There is nothing wrong with either of the items.  The pistol has not been modified at all.  The grips may be changed with any standard 1911 grips.  It is a very nice suppressor host and or target, plinker whatever.  I am selling it to fund another suppressor in a different caliber and when more disposable income becomes available I will likely buy another just like it.  (The can I am buying exceeds the price of both of these items.)  I have other hosts but they all required aftermarket threading so this will be easiest to replace when the time comes.)  I am not interested in trades or traveling to make the face to face sale.  Terms are cash, picked up at my location.  I will need to glance at your LTC and IN driver's lic.  I will not record any of your information or ask that you complete any forms.  Thank you for looking."

I SBR'ed this weapon in Douglas county, Kansas. Any individual in Kansas needs to submit a Form 4 to the ATF and receive the $200 tax stamp on said firearm to purchase. Any individual OUTSIDE of Kansas needs to purchase an additional tax stamp to transfer to their state.

Gun details:

-SBR'ed barrel with three prong flash hider. Flash hider is NOT threaded on, it is plug welded to the barrel.
-B&T (Brugger & Thommet) UMP style folding stock. This is NOT a cheap airsoft knockoff!!

Built for comfort as well as functionality. This Tactical holster features the Self Locking System (SLS™) rotating hood system which is so well suited for the tactical situations encountered today. The hood on the Model 6004 holster can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. The STX Tactical finish of the holster is rugged, protecting the gun in scrape, scratch and dent incidents. Molded sight track and soft SafariSuede™ protect the gun's sights and finish. A special feature of the Model 6004 is the double leg strap and the leg shroud. These two features combined equal comfort and stability in the holster position on the leg.

This gun is .88"" thick, weighs under a pound loaded, chambered in 9mm (a real caliber for tiny carry guns), with a 7 +1 capacity. I have the original box, and an extra mag. I very very recently bought this gun to carry when it wasn't reasonable to carry my Glock 23C. But after having it for a few months, I feel that this gun is to small for my large hands to properly use. (larger than a LCP but smaller than any ""full size"" sub-compact.)

I've had no problems with this gun and have only put 200 rounds through it since I've owned it. I'm looking to trade more than I am to sell for anything really, I'm a bit of a gun nut. I'd like to trade for another pistol or shotgun more than a rifle, but a .17 HMR would be a no brainer trade to me. I can add up to $300 cash if your wanting to trade a quality gun, or I'll let it go for less than what I have in it to have money to play with. If you offer a high end 1911 (only in .45) possibly more than $300 can be offered.

I upgraded the barrel to a shorter 24"" ported barrel. I bought the barrel brand new. It is factory Mossberg camo dipped, factory ported, and came with an extended turkery choke. Also added a Choate mag extension and Knoxx recoil reducing stock. I have put 20 rounds through it the way it is set up now and this thing shoots awesome with very lil recoil.

 Also, I painted the reciever and mag extension to kinda match the barrel. And I bought a used forend off ebay for it. It is a factory finish camo forend but didnt realize until after I bought it that it is the woodland camo and doesnt match the same camo Mossberg used on the barrel. 

Lookign to trade for an 870 or 500 12 or 20ga or possible pistol or rifle. Open to really anything, whatcha got? Trade value is $350-400 but will take $300 cash for it.

I also try to adjust (up or down) this price by current and prevailing market prices for items in the condition I have listed.  The listed prices are fair but I will consider all REASONABLE offers.  Please be knowledgeable of the general market value of the item before making a counter offer.  In most cases can match most published prices for the same item in the same condition.  However, don't expect to get an In-the-Box, unfired, 20 year old classic rifle for the price it sold for 20 years ago, in most cases that's just not reasonable.

All molds are Lyman (to my knowledge). 

I also have several boxes of Four Corners Bullet Company from Center North Dakota made from Lynotype. They are boxes of 500 in 45 ACP 200gn SWC  BB (Boat tail base i think) Sized .451.

38's are $8.00 per hundred with out gas checks. (158 gn SWC wheel weights)
45's are $60.00 per five hundred. (200 gn SWC BB) (I will re pack them but include original label off of box unless otherwise requested). 

I can combine shipping. I ship using Priority mail boxes. You pay actual shipping. I will provide tracking number via an email when i ship them. 

To figure out how much i can ship to you divide 7000 by the weight of the bullet and then multiply by 60. I wrap bullets in bags of 100 taped. I then wrap the bags in news paper and tape them as well. Roughly i can fit 2600 38's and 2100 45 acp's in a box.

I am willing to work on the price a little bit if you order in bulk. Bullets were casted years ago by a friend of my grandfathers. 

Shoot the 38's out of a S&W 586 using 7.3 gn W231 or 14-15 gn H110, and 357 brass. They work great."

In the medical field you could say that I do ""transplants"" to patients needing a new heart, lung or such. Your old Winchester will live again but in another body. Go now, to the fartherest corner of your shop and dig out that old, tired soldier and send it to me. I'll prepare it for surgery.

The rifle has not been fired since the early 90s except for my function testing it yesterday. I fired three shots with Federal 165gr factory ammo into just under 1.25"" at 100M. Amazingly, the scope had not lost it's zero in all these years.

The rifle is pristine save a very small wear area on the trigger guard from where he carried it. Bore is mirror bright, stock finish is in excellent condition.

Also have a new Winchester magazine for it that he never put into the rifle... these mags alone are over $100 when you can find one.
