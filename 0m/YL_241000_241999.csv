The only difference from this particular set of CZs and the others we have listed, is that these do not have their Department Issue boxes. From the early days of a free Czech Republic, here is a specimen of Czech gunsmithy’s finest, best known product, the CZ-75 pistol. First introduced in 1975, CZ led the way with this fine pistol as the premiere Wonder Nine, as we called them back then. Czech engineers took John M. Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power design, strengthened it, and developed a smooth and accurate masterpiece in double action. Photos show 3 different specimens from the issue weapons of the Municipal Police of Ostrava, Czech Republic, where this pistol protected a flourishing population in their industrious city. Year code is stamped above the extractor, 1992. The CZ-75 is a traditional double- and single action auto with a main safety that allows cocked-and-locked carry. This pistol does not have a firing pin block or safety, so its single action trigger pull is crisper than most. The .227 wide serrated spur hammer has a half cock position for safety-off double action carry. Slide is serrated rear for easy operation; and its 4.7 inch barrel with double cam slide lock matches its Browning ancestor. Chrome finished smooth face .315 combat trigger yields a smooth, consistent double action trigger pull of 7/8 inch distance; single action trigger travel measures about 1/3 inch with minimal felt creep. Specimens we have gauged pull at 4 pound vicinity on single action. Sights are stake-on serrated ramp front with dovetailed, well protected dot configuration rear fixed sight. Construction is entirely steel, with CZ’s highly durable Poly-Coat semi-gloss black finish. Grips are issue CZ logo black polymer. Ease of disassembly and reassembly exceeds all other pistols on the market even today, with hash marks on the disassembly position for easy removal of the slide stop / barrel link pin; disassembly yields grip frame, barrel, guide rod and spring. Weight empty is 35 ounces. Surface detractions on this pistol is only moderate, edge whitening and moderate contact surface wear to the grip frame backstrap and moderate toning to the white steel barrel surface. We classify it as Very Good, 80 percent vicinity; photos should suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our grading, the pistol buyer will receive will be substantially identical and from the same Department trade. Left side of slide is marked with the importer’s stamp, PW Arms Redmond WA, as required by US Law; and then the CZ logo and Model 75 cal. 9 Para, with Made in Czechoslovakia on the left side of the frame. These fine pistols are well maintained by their Ostrava officers; and they are excellent mechanically; bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent. These fine pistols will digest any ammunition, from lead bullet reloads to steel case Russian to the finest Federal Hydra-Shok sharp-nosed hollowpoints. That is something one cannot say about competitors Glock and HK, to name a couple. Another strong suite is their slides mate precisely to the frames, full steel-rail-to-steel-rail contact, not with a slide resting on four small runners like their Austrian competitors. This is a real pistol, not a piece of plastic. Each pistol comes with an original issue steel 15 shot magazine. We’re offering these fine pistols, the ones in the photos or one of their mates from the same batch, each	for only $ 329.00.

Date of manufacture of this gun is 1943.  This rifle has the highly sought after steel butt plate and ""30 WCF"" stamp on the barrel.  Also has the Winchester dealer only installed Marble's compass in the top of the butt stock.

Condition is about 80% with some wear and light pitting on the reciever.  Overall condition of the Walnut stock and forend is in great shape, with some dings.  Bore is clear and bright, with strong rifling.  I don't think this rifle has been shot much, due to the lack of blueing loss at the end of the barrel.  The lever is strong, and crisp with zero slop.

This is a classic!!

   I have my XDm 40 for sale. It is the BiTone- stainless/black finish and is in excellent condition. It is chambered in 40 S&W. It has all of the Springfield Armory accessories and also has a nice leather IWB holster and four high capacity magazines. There have been approx 600 rounds fired through this gun and has never had any jams or malfunctions

   What sets this XDm apart from the rest is that it had the slide and barrel matched at the factory. You can see the paper work detailing this. When this was purchased, Springfield was asked what could be done to make this the most accurate XDm available. Since they already come with the match grade barrel, they said there is a special order procedure they can do to fit the barrel to the slide. This provides the perfect fitment for the perfect shot!

   There is over $950 in this package and you can have it for $650! Shipping and insurance to FFL is extra. Not available for purchase in states that ban high capacity magazines. 

   Thanks!

This rifle has less than 100 rounds through the pipe, I performed a proper barrel seasoning for the first 20 shots as recommended by HOWA. The rifle shares many of the same components as the Weatherby Vanguard. Comes with a 3-9x40 Scope. The rifle has an integrated Weaver/Picatinny rail on the top ready for your own scope if you wish. The package sold for $550 new. You must be 18 years of age to purchase this rifle, must be sent to FFL for transfer. Shipping is extra if sending out of state to FFL."

All of the accessories come with it and I will not separate this package, as I dont have another GSG.

This is a Pre Lawsuit GSG, so it is a copy of the MP5

I am looking for a S&W M&P 15-22, or Mossberg Tactical 22, or related AR style .22.

This GSG has a blued finish receiver, metal 3 rail RIS forend, MFI Inc. MP5 style flash hider, Barska red dot sight, light/laser combo with pressure switch attached wit velcro to an ATI forend grip, single point sling, 2-22rd mags, 1-20rd mag, dual mag clamp, 110rd drum mag, manual, tool, amongst other stuff.

It has a low round count, only a couple of hundred, which is very low for a .22.

With all of the extras that are in this package it easily is worth more than a basic bare bones brand new M&P 15-22 with only a couple of mags. Mossberg Tactical .22's are around 299.00 at Gander. The 110r drum and RIS Foend together are 200.00.

Great fun gun to play with, and looks cool too.

I am only looking for AR style .22, No AK style stuff.

All of the accessories come with it and I will not separate this package, as I dont have another GSG.

This is a Pre Lawsuit GSG, so it is a copy of the MP5

I am looking for a ""bare bones"" S&W M&P 15-22, Ruger SR-22 or 10-22 with AR stock, Remington 597, Umarex, H&K 224 or Mossberg Tactical 22, or any other related AR style .22, with a few magazines. 

Don't need a bunch of stuff with yours unless you want to put it in with the trade. I have scopes and such.

This GSG has a blued finish receiver, Classic Army metal 3 rail RIS forend with covers, MFI Inc. MP5 style flash hider, H&K Quick Takedown push pins, H&K Rear Drum Sight, Barska red dot sight, PSI xenon light with laser combo with pressure switch attached with velcro to a rail cover, single point sling, 2-22rd mags, 1-20rd mag, dual mag clamp, 110rd drum mag, manual, and take down tool.

It has a low round count, only a couple of hundred, which is very low for a .22.

With all of the extras that are in this package it easily is worth more than a basic bare bones brand new M&P 15-22, SR22 etc., with only a couple of mags. Mossberg Tactical .22's are around 299.00 at Gander. The 110r drum and RIS Forend together are 200.00.

Great fun gun to play with, and looks cool too. Red Dot is zeroed in at 50 yards.

The three Metal form magazines run flawlessly. The three modified Uzi mags work but could stand to be tuned a bit. The other three Uzi mags have not been modified in any way yet so they will not lock into the rifle. All that needs to be done is to mill out the mag latch slot. I had a buddy with a mill do the first three for me and never got around to having him do the other three.

The RRA FSB was removed to install the free float tube and I’ll include it and the barrel nut. 

I have shot everything from light cast lead hand loads to factory ammo. This gun fed and cycled them all. 

Selling this mainly to finance an AR45 build. The only trades I'd consider is for AR45 components.

OK. After I posted this I got bored and messed with it to try and suit my needs. What I did was drill a hole  mid way up the clip, and attached a t-nut  and screw through the back to try and make it work with my fat ass.The plan was to hold it tighter to the leather, which it does. But I still don't like it.
It still functions the way it was supposed to.The screw and nut are still there, but I can remove them ,resulting in a hole in the clip.
** END EDIT**

I bought this through the Kahr Shop for my P380. I got this in November of 2011 and have worn it twice for a total of about 2 hours. I always heard good things about Crossbreed so I bought this through the   Kahr Shop for $59. Kahr stocks it, so it saved me app. 1 month wait from Crossbreed.
I'm a bit overweight and discovered that IWB doesn't work well for me, so that's why I'm selling it."

FEATURES 
The flagship feature of the Jimenez Arms J.A. Nine is its easy to use massive screw adjustable rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation. Other, higher priced, pistols do not offer this kind of flexibility. The high visibility front sight is another great feature which adds to a highly effective sight pattern. These features coupled with a last round slide hold open makes this pistol uncommonly accurate and a delight at the range.
