This was built up by a really good gunsmith. 
  The barrel has been shortened, threaded, and compensated. The bolt has been bent, the old iron sights have been removed and replaced by a 2x7 scout scope.
   A new synthetic stock has been added. I did get bored one day and i practiced a few painting techniques on it. If you like it, thanks! If you dont like it, it won't be too hard to strip the paint.
   And the old mushy trigger has been replaced by a crisp Timney Trigger. This rifle shoots unbelievably better than any stock mosin, It's not even in the same league as stock mosins. If you havent shot one of these before you're in for a treat.
   I have a few extra goodies i can throw in, if the deal gets sweet.

Thanks to everybody who looked.

Rare Glock 17 Gen 1 LE stamped ""MPDC"" for Metropolitan Police Department Washington DC, and has the proof stampings on the slide and barrel. 

Serial # ""ETxxxx"", manufactured in 1988, commissioned in 1989. This gun is in all original shape/parts. This gun shows the normal wear of a 25 year old pistol, mostly holster wear, but what I would consider, in ""very good"" shape. The internals are perfect, and appears to have been shot very little.

Comes with 3 Glock 17 rd. mags stamped ""RESTRICTED LE/GOVT ONLY"", and a generic Plano case.

Serious inquiries only, and no low ball offers...I know what I have."

Model: 1894 Saddle Ring Carbine

Year of Manufacture: 1897

Caliber: .30wcf

Barrel: 20"" Nickel Steel

Finish: Blued worn down to a nice silver with strong bluing still in protected areas. Firebluing on the loading gate is still visible.

Bore: is in outstanding condition. An easy 8-9 out of 10.

Sights: 
Rear: Earliest style flip up ladder sight(One just like mine, but in far worse condition just sold on eBay for $182.49 for the sight alone!) 
Front: Blade bead with ivory bead insert

Wood: Forend is in good condition overall. Stock has some shrinkage and someone put a recoil pad on it before I got it.

Metal: overall the metal is in really good shape with no real pitting or major handling marks aside from:
The saddle ring stud broke off. This is an easy fix. $18 in parts and $20 in labor.
The upper tang has a very old repair on it. This does not affect the function at all. 

Overall this is a beauty of an old Winchester levergun and an addition to anyone's collection.

His was a Stainless 6 inch Python with little vents at the top of the barrel and black rubber like grips with a Gold ( I think ) medallion on each side. In looking for one on the Googled sites I saw a Python Elite I'm sure he'd love in place of his and that I would truly adore giving him. It's my 30th wedding anniversary and this is what I want to give him. He's going to be my new shooting partner....he just doesn't know it yet! I think anything except the blued Python's would be good. It doesnt have to be new but should be better than a hammer for nails as I already have a pink hammer that works just fine. So, in short, I'm looking to buy a New or really nice;
1. Colt Python Elite with 6 inch barrel in stainless or satin or nickle or whatever they made them out of, or
2. Colt Python with the same finishes, or
3. I might be interested in a 4 inch barrel if my choices are limited.
I would prefer the boxes and papers and whatever came with the gun so its that much nicer a gift but it doesn't have to be if it's the right gun. I've looked the guns sites I've seen over and found the way overpriced Colt's but any sites you may know of that I don't would be welcomed, as with any advice. So please PM me or Email me @ REDACTED if you have or know of
something I may be interested in or that I need to know before buying. I'm not an expert so will be asking alot of stupid questions. Thank you for reading this. Have a great day tomorrow. Sarah"

The m/1896 rifles are highly sought after by military rifle shooters and hunters. The 6.5x55mm is an ideal all-round hunting rifle cartridge, as it has a flat trajectory, low recoil, and high accuracy. Many rifles in the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and South Africa have been sporterized to make deer (or similar game) hunting rifles, and many firearms manufacturers, including SAKO, Ruger and Winchester, produce new hunting rifles chambered in this cartridge.

""Swedish Mausers"" are a family of bolt-action rifles based on an improved variant of Mauser's earlier Model 1893, but using the 6.5x55mm cartridge, and incorporating unique design elements as requested by Sweden. In 1898 production began at Carl Gustafs stads Gevärsfaktori in Eskilstuna, Sweden. All Swedish Mausers were chambered for the 6.5 x 55 mm Swedish-Norwegian Mauser cartridge, and all Swedish-made actions were proof-tested with a single cartridge developing 66,000psi. Swedish Mausers were manufactured by Waffenfabrik Mauser Oberndorf a/N in Germany and in Sweden by Carl Gustafs stads Gevärsfaktori and Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag. All Swedish Mausers, whether built in Germany or Sweden, were fabricated using a Swedish-supplied high grade tool steel alloyed with nickel, copper, and vanadium, a product noted for its strength and corrosion resistance. 

These rifles, like other pre-1898 Mausers, feature ""cock-on-closing"" (similar to the contemporary Lee-Enfield rifle) instead of the ""cock-on-opening"" style found on the German Gewehr 98 and most subsequent bolt action rifles.

Like new/never used, except I moved the holster to the belt and added the extra 2 rifle mag pouches on left chest.  It is missing the velcro six shotshell holder.  Unlike the description below, it actually has Six Rifle mag pouches, and they are all double stack 30rd AK/AR size.  So this vest holds a total of 12 rifle mags and 6 pistol mags.  It's a comfortable sturdy vest and I'm only selling because I decided I want another color.

(from Armalite's lit.) This rifle is the newest incarnation of the wildly popular AR-50 chambered for the powerful 50 BMG cartridge. A single shot bolt action rifle featuring a unique octagonal receiver bedded down into a V-shaped stock. Designed to be an economical answer for the challenges of long range shooting, the AR-50A1 is amazingly accurate and with its massive fluted muzzle brake, it has a very gentle recoil. The AR-50A1 is a highly refined rifle which is a stark and refreshing difference that maintains its superiority over its competition. 

ArmaLite's great .50 has been refined, with smoother action, attractive new bolt stop, and even greater strength than the original AR-50. The same great accuracy, but now even more Beautiful.

Oh and I forgot to mention, now that its converted gun must go through MSP or FFL.  I will meet within reason but I'm not driving to ocean city and selling you the gun out of the back of my truck.

I have a Bushmaster AR15 9mm spec.  Best thing about this AR is that its not just a 9mm only AR, if you have a .223/5.56 upper, you can slap it on and pop the 2 pins in and you're ready to shoot.  Comes with a total of 3 magazines. the 2 mags fit the mag slot how it is, and i also have a sleeve for the mag slot so you can put regular 9mm AR mags in it. comes with 1 normal 9mm mag.  I just cleaned the entire gun very well and is all lubed up.  

Has a black Magpul hand guard, better grip, and 6 position butt stock. Comes with a nice case with spots to store 6 9mm mags, or 3 .223 mags. I also have a AR wrench.  

I just took it to the range for the first time and i found that i need a little part in the bolt (guys at range printed me out a sheet saying $30 bucks for a bolt rehab kit at CMMG.com)

All brass has been polished and the mechanism tuned. It's adjustments are smooth as silk; better then my new one. This is a very accurate and repeatable measure. I've considered selling my new on and keeping this one!

New reservoir and cap have been ordered as well.

The Lyman #55 powder measure is packed full of features. The unique three slide adjustable cavity coupled with extra fine adjustments of width and depth provide consistent charges with almost any powder. The 200 grain metering capacity with an attached knocker assures a complete charge every time. The 2400 grain reservoir resists chemical action and protects your powder from harmful light rays. Mount on a bench, stand or press.

This measure sells new for $90. In my view, the vintage one is better and being offered at a bargain price of $50.

The only real difference between the new version and this is the color. This is a proven design and just plain works!"

UPDATE
I am absolutely not interested in any trade at the moment, so please do not email with offers. Also, the price for the package is FIRM, I wil not go below 300 for all of it. This is a all parts matching sks with all the original kit sans the bayonet, going off gunbroker you would easily spend 275 bucks after shipping and transfers on the cheapest possible auctions that have ran over the past 4 months, and the ammo alone would run you around 80-100 bucks on the cheap end so rest assured that you are getting a generous deal, and the only reason im selling it is to fund a different gun project."

Mounted on it is a night force scope, think it is 12x24x56 mil dot, with lit cross hairs. Everything about this gun is first class. I have a custom pelican case for it as well. 
I have this priced at what I think is a fair price for what I have in it and what I am offering. I paid 2400.00 + tax for gun, 2500.00 + tax for scope, 200 for case, and I have all items to be able to reload your own ammo ( dies, brass about 40 once fired and 10 - 20 live rounds, primers, powder, bullets) all that adds up to around 200 or 300 bucks. 
Last time I purchased ammo it was 75 to 100 bucks for Lapua brand, 10 rounds I believe in each box. 
I am shifting interest lately to messing around with my Jeep. So I need cash to buy parts for it. 
This gun is perfect and almost broke in. 
I know it is specialized gun and I know it is costly. I have not seen to many on armslist that have this price. Hope I am listing on the correct forum.

If I had the funds, I would just buy the SR9c as second pistol, but being a college student doesn't make that easy.

I've decided that since I'll likely be using an SR9c as my daily carry (I fell in love with it at the range) when I turn 21 next year, I'm--sadly--going to part with my Sigma.

Photo included is an actual photo of the gun. It comes with pistol, two 16rd magazines, and a 20rd box of Speer GoldDot 124gr. hollowpoints. I've also got one of these Blackhawk! Sportster ambi holster w/ mag pouch (stock photo below) which fits the gun perfectly.


The gun itself has had about 1200rds through it (I'm the second owner), never any sort of jam. I've thoroughly cleaned it after every trip to the range (those winchester whiteboxes aren't the cleanest to shoot), and the previous owner is a guy who takes serious care of his hardware, so I know he cleaned it very regularly as well.
This gun has had the popular Sigma trigger modification done (replaced the springs, original springs are still in the box), and the trigger pull has been reduced from the factory ~14lbs to a much more manageable ~6lbs. About 300rd of the total are post-mod, with zero jams.

I'm looking to trade (plus cash, if necessary) for a used Ruger SR9c. Will obtain 10-day purchase permit upon agreeing on price and meeting location. I'm not quite sure how a trade works, presumably both parties must fill out a purchase permit."

Field gun with 28"" barrel, screw in choke and black synthetic stock.
3"" chamber.  A very good shooter.  I only fired 50 rounds in the two years I've owned it and broke all 50 rocks at trap.

Has turkey tape residue on the barrel that I have not tried to remove.
They all look the same, so, no pics."

This kit came with my AK, but I wanted a more standard AK look so I swapped everything out for regular polymer furniture.  I don't know much about ATI sets, but it looks and feels pretty solid.  Never shot the rifle while it was on, so I can't speak on that.

Sold as a set and includes:
- Stock - folding, adjustable length and adjustable cheek riser
- Pistol grip
- Upper handguard with top rail
- Lower handguard with side and bottom rails

All parts are lightly used, never abused.  The whole set looks near new - no major scratches, dings or dents except for some minor sanding to make parts fit.  Does not include mounting screws for the stock.  

I believe this is the same kit:

Only difference is I don't think it has the Scorpion recoil system.  It seems to be a new standard feature on newer sets from ATI, after this one was made.  As you can see, this set retails over $100 not including shipping."

This 20C slide will fit any large gen 2, 3, or 4, glock frame. This is no mere conversion kit as this includes nights sights (with wind adjustments), and the slide. Glock will not sell a slide, nor will anyone else, which makes this a tough find. All the parts are new, and the part has almost never been shot.  (there is mark from the factory that is still on the gun that says so.) I recently had this part checked out by a Glock specialist, and said it was worth around 380.
