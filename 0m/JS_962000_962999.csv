Mid-length gas system and 16"" chrome lined barrel. Spikes are known for being super reliable and accurate rifles out of the box with great fit and finish, and there is a long waiting list to get your hands on one. They are highly desirable and thats why it takes forever to get a new one and they are selling for over $2000 right now on gunbroker. This is not some walmart bushmaster or dpms, each and every Spikes rifle is built by craftsmen with tight quality control and attention to detail. You will find absolutely zero negative comments about them anywhere and they are the choice of many law enforcement officers that are in the know. Dont take my word for it, research it yourself and read some reviews. Kills me to sell it now after it finally came in only a month ago but I desperately need the cash for another vehicle and that is the only reason why I am even considering it. I would also consider trades up or down with cash on your part or mine for a decent reliable and fuel efficient vehicle. Prefer something like a toyota truck but open to any offers, just depends on what you have. Looking to work with someone to come up with an arrangement that satisfies us both, or just sell the rifle outright. If you have an extra vehicle you dont need that doesnt have any serious problems and want to get yourself a higher end AR without spending a dime, maybe we can make a deal that helps us both out.

*I do not have the BCG for this rifle. I gave it to my brother as a Xmas gift and there is nothing I can do about that. The rifle is new in the factory hardshell case, never been fired, but I DO NOT have the bcg. If anyone wants to supply their own bcg and get my new Spikes rifle, $2000 is what it will take. The price is firm. As you can tell, I really do not want to sell this rifle."

All small pins and springs have been replaced, op-rod spring replaced, and the entire M1 was re-parked in manganese phosphate, down to the handguard metal. Headspaced and timing block checked, then test fired with Greek HXP.   recently installed Fulton Armory NM sights front and rear.  Original SA front and rear sights included.

Approximately 200 rounds have been fired through this and it functions perfectly with the SR197 and the SS192 rounds. This will have to be a FTF transaction in the Woodland/LaCenter/Ridgefield area and I will require a signed bill of sale and valid ID. Preferably someone with a valid cpl.  I am looking to get $2200 cash and will consider some possible partial trades. Mostly interested in H&K handguns in 9mm, 40mm, or .357sig. I will consider other makes as well so let me know what you have but they must be in perfect condition just like this rifle is. I might also consider a HD shotgun as a partial trade. Again, let me know what you have to trade, the worst that can happen is I say I'm not interested.

A couple of people has sent me messages saying that the price is way too high. If you look at what a new Aimpoint H1 with mount and battery(no, they don't include one with it) is going for you'll see it's over $600. The Magpul UBR stocks are over $250 IF you can even find one. FNH mags and ammunition are incredibly over priced right now as well but it is what it is and I have no control over it. If someone [B]just wants the upper[/B], make me an offer. They are out of stock everywhere and going for a lot more than I want on GB. I would also trade straight across for a .45acp upper in equal shape or one of the handguns I listed above."

The rifle is in excellent condition and performs flawlessly. Only 180 rounds have been fired through the rifle. The gun is more pleasurable to shoot with the steel lower and recoil.

Alexander Arms® is the originator of the large-caliber, .50 Beowulf®, AR-15 style weapon concept. As the leader in the field, we manufacture the best and most reliable weapons. We have an intimate understanding of the function of both the rifle and the ammunition and have in-depth data on both internal, external, and terminal ballistics. In a world of followers, we lead. The .50 Beowulf® was designed to generate devastating stopping power at short to moderate ranges. Combining the rugged reliability of the AR-15/M16 style weapons with a unique .500 inch projectile and cartridge, this semi-automatic weapon is ideal as a brush hunting weapon and is capable of knocking down virtually anything you may run across. For wild pig hunting, the rifle is without equal and is being used not only by hunters, but by game control agencies as well. Deer in close cover are easily taken with solid hits guaranteeing one shot kills and little or no tracking. The same reliable combination of heavy, large-diameter bullets and moderate velocities enable the .50 Beowulf® to tackle the largest game animals found in North America and it has been used against elk, buffalo, and bear with superb results. Providing a semi-automatic, light-carbine with the performance of the venerable 45-70 rifle, the .50 Beowulf® has found wide acceptance with military and law enforcement agencies. The external ballistics of the .50 Beowulf® cartridge are well-suited to urban environments where the shorter range template allows for more flexible application and the large projectile energy delivered by the ammunition can disable both motor vehicles and assailants with body armor. Windscreen glass does not affect the trajectory of the bullet, nor do automotive body panels. With frangible projectiles, the .50 Beowulf® can be used on most training facilities without damage and, with the addition of a muzzle brake to provide a stand-off, can be used for building entry. The combination of devastating stopping power and absolute reliability in a lightweight, familiar form factor, the .50 Beowulf® rifle from Alexander Arms® is simply without equal."

I am not in Massachusetts and not planing any visits. I have some firearms and magazines that may be of interest and legal for Mass residents to own. I am in the process of verifying the manufacture dates of the firearms to see what can go there.
Any firearm I sell will only be done using an FFL to FFL transaction. I will accept only USPS MO for payment if we can work this out. I have a contingency plan to comply with all new laws here. Have friends and relatives in other free states where the toys can go.

Is there any interest in Para-Ordnance 1911's?
Have a complete example built on an early p14 alloy frame in 45 that will certainly be eligible to be sent to Mass.
Also a NIB p14-45 that MAY meet the cut off date.
Possibly a p12-45 could also make the trip.

reply with models that interest you and I will do more research.

I have all pre 1994 ban original capacity mags for these, planning to sell with the arms. many in original factory packaging.

As I am not a resident of your state, I don't know your laws. 
Your local FFL is who will make sure the laws in your state are followed. 

I had to put a price in the price box. The actual price will be determined at a later date."

Alexander Arms® is the originator of the large-caliber, .50 Beowulf®, AR-15 style weapon concept. As the leader in the field, we manufacture the best and most reliable weapons. We have an intimate understanding of the function of both the rifle and the ammunition and have in-depth data on both internal, external, and terminal ballistics. In a world of followers, we lead. The .50 Beowulf® was designed to generate devastating stopping power at short to moderate ranges. Combining the rugged reliability of the AR-15/M16 style weapons with a unique .500 inch projectile and cartridge, this semi-automatic weapon is ideal as a brush hunting weapon and is capable of knocking down virtually anything you may run across. For wild pig hunting, the rifle is without equal and is being used not only by hunters, but by game control agencies as well. Deer in close cover are easily taken with solid hits guaranteeing one shot kills and little or no tracking. The same reliable combination of heavy, large-diameter bullets and moderate velocities enable the .50 Beowulf® to tackle the largest game animals found in North America and it has been used against elk, buffalo, and bear with superb results. Providing a semi-automatic, light-carbine with the performance of the venerable 45-70 rifle, the .50 Beowulf® has found wide acceptance with military and law enforcement agencies. The external ballistics of the .50 Beowulf® cartridge are well-suited to urban environments where the shorter range template allows for more flexible application and the large projectile energy delivered by the ammunition can disable both motor vehicles and assailants with body armor. Windscreen glass does not affect the trajectory of the bullet, nor do automotive body panels. With frangible projectiles, the .50 Beowulf® can be used on most training facilities without damage and, with the addition of a muzzle brake to provide a stand-off, can be used for building entry. The combination of devastating stopping power and absolute reliability in a lightweight, familiar form factor, the .50 Beowulf® rifle from Alexander Arms® is simply without equal."

This model has a threaded barrel & will accommodate a muzzle break. The lower is a New Frontier LW-15. This rifle comes with one magazine. Additional magazines available for purchase. Up to 100 rounds of Alexander Arms .50 caliber ammunition also available for purchase ($3.00/round). A2 style sights or 4X scope & bipod also available for purchase. Refer to Alexander Arms website for further info. Please refer to New Frontier website for info on the lower.
.50 Beowulf® Alexander Arms® is the originator of the large-caliber, AR-15 style weapon concept. As the leader in the field, we manufacture the best and most reliable weapons. They have an intimate understanding of the function of both the rifle and the ammunition and have in-depth data on both internal, external, and terminal ballistics. In a world of followers, we lead. The .50 Beowulf® was designed to generate devastating stopping power at short to moderate ranges. Combining the rugged reliability of the AR-15/M16 style weapons with a unique .500 inch projectile and cartridge, this semi-automatic weapon is ideal as a brush hunting weapon and is capable of knocking down virtually anything you may run across. For wild pig hunting, the rifle is without equal and is being used not only by hunters, but by game control agencies as well. Deer in close cover are easily taken with solid hits guaranteeing one shot kills and little or no tracking. The same reliable combination of heavy, large-diameter bullets and moderate velocities enable the .50 Beowulf® to tackle the largest game animals found in North America and it has been used against elk, buffalo, and bear with superb results. Providing a semi-automatic, light-carbine with the performance of the venerable 45-70 rifle, the .50 Beowulf® has found wide acceptance with military and law enforcement agencies. The external ballistics of the .50 Beowulf® cartridge are well-suited to urban environments where the shorter range template allows for more flexible application and the large projectile energy delivered by the ammunition can disable both motor vehicles and assailants with body armor. Windscreen glass does not affect the trajectory of the bullet, nor do automotive body panels. With frangible projectiles, the .50 Beowulf® can be used on most training facilities without damage and, with the addition of a muzzle brake to provide a stand-off, can be used for building entry. The combination of devastating stopping power and absolute reliability in a lightweight, familiar form factor, the .50 Beowulf® rifle from Alexander Arms® is simply without equal."

The SW9VEs and SW40VEs barrels and slides are all professionally duracoated in matte black to match the frame (giving it an all black finish, much like the special edition VE's that were hard to find). I had the Barrels done as well, whereas some ive seen previously just did the slide. This adds to the durability of the barrel as well as the look. Also added adapters and red lasers to each as well. Each pair comes with 10 mags (5 mags per gun), with the 9VE mags being 16 rounds and the 40VE mags being 14 rounds. The reason the VE series also was the one where you could still make the trigger mods to them to lighten the trigger pull (2 of mine have the trigger job done already), while also being improved over the first series of sigmas. From what i hear, the SD series isnt able to do trigger mods. Looking to get $950 per pair

The mags alone are going for about $40 each on gunbroker, so between that, the duracoat, and the lasers, these are well worth the asking price ($40 x the 10 mags in each pair = 400, duracoat + laser and adapter = $75, so just in extras theres $475 per pair)

from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short 
barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where

rugged garand-style action uses a breechbolt locking system, a fixed position 
gas system, and a self-cleaning moving gas cylinder to give it unparalleled 
reliability under harsh operating conditions. A heavy, hammer-forged barrel 
provides extra rigidity and accuracy.

from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short 
barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where 
maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. The Mini 14's simple, 
rugged garand-style action uses a breechbolt locking system, a fixed position 
gas system, and a self-cleaning moving gas cylinder to give it unparalleled 
reliability under harsh operating conditions. A heavy, hammer-forged barrel 
provides extra rigidity and accuracy.
