POWER, PURE AND SIMPLE.

Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 optics rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match-toleranced barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a rock-solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. The chamber area is encased by the thick-walled aluminum extrusion of the receiver, resulting in unparalleled safety for the shooter.

The bolt is machined from a single piece of shock-resistant tool steel. The action’s strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt’s few moving parts, an extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly, make it reliable and easy to maintain.


The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is exclusive to Barrett and virtually maintenance-free. The bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting.

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 combines smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot.

It is hammerless and has 3 safetys on it. 
1: regular safety above trigger
 2: backstrap safety like the early Colt hammerless 1908's
 3: with magazine out it wont fire

In the past few years I've only seen a handfull of these up for auction or being sold. They are just that good of pocket pistol and go BANG everytime.

I am looking to see if there would be any interests in possibly trading my H&R M1 GARAND for a nice  Russian SVT-40 in similar condition and matching as much as possible, with sling and take down tool a plus,

(Trade value should be equal or accompanied with some cash difference)

1955 H&R M1 GARAND:

New Criterion Barrel
TE: 0
ME: 0
Original USGI Birch Stock
Original M1 Sling
SQUARE P Cartouche

I completed a Data Sheet on it and in doing so found that for the most part it is all H&R parts, the Bolt has been determined to be WW-II Springfield bolt. The rest of the parts are H&R. I will post the Data Sheet review.
I was also told on the CMP forum that the Gas Lock is WW II
The rifle is not a Cut-Reweld receiver, it is original, I have researched the Serial Number and the Receiver Drawing Number is correct in being with the Serial Number of the rifle.. 

Regarding the Bayonet seen in the picture:

Bayonet that is pictured is not included but available, preferably in the trade if there are additional items included on the SVT-40 or other Trade rifles

Bayonet is marked: US M5A1- Imperial and has the Defense Acceptance Stamp (D.A.S.) 

Trade Value is around: $1150.00

These are definitely NOT a mass produced “assembly line” rifle! We simply use the finest, GUN-KOTE™ premium metal coating & finish, for maximum protection of the rifle’s metal surfaces. It was first specified by the U.S. Military for use on SOCOM Special Sniper Weapons (SPR’s) in 2003. GUN-KOTE™ is superior to parkerized, blued, or air dry finishes in both durability and performance. GUN-KOTE™ satin matte black finish protects metal parts from rustcorrosion, & scratches and will not break down, peel or dissolve. In fact, once applied and heat-cured, the only way to remove it is through abrasive blasting. GUN-KOTE™ is resistant to all known gun solvents, oils, and thinners. GUN-KOTE™ is a highly specialized, hard, abrasion resistant coating that meets all military specifications for protective coatings. GUN-KOTE™ is formulated to provide excellent impact resistance, lubricity (meets military dry firing specs), heat dissipation, chemical resistance, corrosion protection, durability, and scratch resistance. It is specially formulated for salt corrosion protection and meets US Military requirements for ""Resistant to Chemicals"". GUN-KOTE™ has outstanding heat dissipating qualities, outstanding temperature variation durability  (+800 degrees F to -300 degrees F), and outstanding lubrication qualities. The M4 six-position collapsible stock is manufactured in the USA with military grade polymer and a super strong machined aluminum tube. We include a custom machined steel side-rail installed on the left side of the receiver to provide you the option to mount variable power scopes. The double hook USA mfg. G2 trigger group delivers a crisp 3-4 lb. trigger pull. The original CHROME LINED barrel has a bayonet lug and includes mil-spec 14:1 left hand metric threads to attach any muzzle device. The slotted RPK style muzzle break has both slots and ports to help control the muzzle during rapid fire. The UTG® PRO quad-rail system is made in the USA from aircraft grade aluminum. The four mil-spec picatinny rails have integrated QD-swivel housings on left/right rails for accessories. Protective snap on black rubber rail guards are included. The Israeli pistol grip has ergonomic finger groves with a hinged bottom plate and a battery storage tube
 that holds two CR123A batteries. The TST vertical foregrip is ultra-light- weighs less than 4 ounces, and folds flat under the bottom rail to allow all mags and drums to be easily inserted and removed. PACKAGE INCLUDES a brand new South Korean 75 round rear load drum magazine (just like the original Chinese drums!), six  THERMOLD USA mfg. 30rd polymer mags, and two (2) original Bulgarian military magazines with steel lined feed lips.thanks You can mail me on REDACTED or text me on REDACTED for more detail"

 If you get this barrel you have to use FACTORY ammunition. Reloads WILL NOT seat properly in a Barsto barrel due to the tight tolerances. (I tried reloads with a Sig 229 in a Barsto conversion barrel, and it was a mess. Barsto asked if I could read because the insert said to use factory ammo/new brass)

*  It's had approximately 350-400 rounds through it.  
*  The trigger is much better than factory - much better pull and reset.  That work was done by having an Apex Tactical hard sear installed.  
*  I had the night sights installed by David Bowie (bowietacticalconcepts.com).  He also used some orange paint around the front night sight so that the complete front sight is more visible in daylight.  The sights are tritium green in the front and tritium yellow in the rear.  
*  It has 4 total magazines.  3 of them are the standard 12 round mags that fit flush.  1 of them is a brand new 17 round magazine that fits the full-size 9mm M&P pistol.  I'm also including 2 X-Grip magazine adapters.  The X-Grip magazine adapter slides onto the full-size mag so you can use it with the 9c pistol, basically giving you a continuous full-size grip when you want it.  the 2nd X-Grip can be used with another full-size mag, if you have one.

 This is the first official Heckler & Koch MP5 chambered in .22 LR. Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5 is engineered as a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It's built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.

The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. A 25 round magazine is available. It is proportionate in size to the centerfire version's mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine.

Operation:

The .22 caliber HK MP5 A5 operates on a blowback system. The bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its front sight is adjustable for elevation and comes with interchangeable posts. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety switch rotates in the same manner as the 9 mm MP5.

 The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.

Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416's pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient.

Operation:

The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe' to ‘Fire'. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open.

The Heckler & Koch SL8 is a sporting rifle manufactured by Heckler & Koch. It is the civilian version of the Heckler & Koch G36. The rifle fires the .223 Remington or 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge and feeds from a 10 round detachable magazine. Unlike earlier types of HK rifles, it is not a roller lock bolt but rather a lug type rotating bolt system as seen on the AR-18. The SL8 was originally developed for the German Bundeswehr, to provide a weapon for training reservists. With the solid proven action and heavy barrel these rifle have astounding accuracy out of the box.

New (Never fired) Beretta AL390 Camo, 12ga, Advantage,® a weather-proof edge.  Handles 2-3/4"" or 3"" 12-Gauge shells interchangeably The AL390 Silver Mallard has a rugged, durable stock and fore-end built of advanced polymer compounds reinforced with fiberglass.  This makes the stock strong, rigid and impervious to the harshest weather.  The gun features an innovative Advantage® camouflage synthetic stock and fore-end covered with the Advantage pattern.  The Advantage camo design features a combination of eight different earth tones, natural shapes and open areas to present four patterns in one: limb, leaf, bark and sky.  This ensures the pattern will blend in with an incredible variety of natural settings.  Built-in sling swivels make it easy to prepare your AL390 Synthetic for the field.  The weight is unchanged, producing the same reduced recoil for which the standard AL390 is so well known. This is not the Standard AL390.

The M2 Field is the workhorse of the Benelli semi-auto line. Light, nimble, but ruggedly built, the Benelli M2 is built around the ultra-reliable Inertia Driven bolt mechanism. The Inertia Driven system allows the M2 to digest nearly any 12-gauge cartridge, from 2 3/4 in. target loads to the heaviest 3 in. magnums. Benelli engineers have also adapted the ComforTech recoil system for the M2. This revolutionary system reduces felt recoil by up to 48%, and cuts muzzle climb by 15%. When combined, this puts the you back on target up to 69% faster than any other comparable semi-automatic shotgun. The M2 is not only faster, but with the new ComforTech system, it may be the most comfortable shotgun you ever will shoot. The M2 is a workhorse with the speed of a thoroughbred."

This is the harder to come by 9mm version of this pistol, That is more accurate and easier to control than the 40S&W models which can be found every where, I also find that the 9mm models seem to cost a little more than the 40 caliber ones do, This is probably because they are more desirable with less felt recoil and better accuracy then its bigger caliber brother, And probably because they are also harder to come by then the forty caliber models.  I paid $589.95 plus tax for this pistol and have not shot over 100 rounds through it. 

For a compact pistol this is surprisingly accurate and hides out really good, And can be use as a single action pistol as well as a double action pistol, And with the use of a factory magazine spacer sleeve, A full size Beretta 92fs hi-cap magazine can be used in it...

Features a stainless steel, self-cleaning piston that operates directly against the proven rotating bolt, thereby eliminating the need for complex linkages found on other, inferior gas systems. This piston-driven system, perfected by Benelli, incorporates a gas port located just forward of the chamber, where the gases are hotter and cleaner, resulting in less fouling and more reliable cycling. The result—a Benelli carbine with features rivaling all other home defense rifles, including Marine—tough reliability and the ability to function in the harshest environmental conditions.  Great gun and accurate.  $1100 new plus tax, asking $950. Uses AR15 magazines.  Have a new project in the works so I would like to sell a couple of guns off.  PM with questions.  Thanks.

A golden example of classic American craftsmanship with Old-West-inspired embellishments and premium varmint-hunting performance. This popular model was voted ""2001 Gun of the Year"" by the readers of Guns & Ammo magazine. Its Brasslite receiver shines for a look that hews close to the stagecoach-defending original. Finely grained American walnut stock with a brass buttplate. The hefty, blued, octagonal barrel provides perfect balance for accurate off-hand shooting. Metal barrel band. Adjustable buckhorn-style rear sight and beaded front sight. Easy-to-load, 12-round tubular magazine. Made in USA."

Also included are three 10 rd magazines, one 13 rd magazine, and a +2 mag extension that you can install if desired, and a Plano hard case. 

I have personally installed a Pearce grip plug, Lone Wolf extended mag release, Ghost Tactical 5.0 trigger connector with overtravel stop, Wolff 6 lb Trigger Spring, Wolff 6 lb Firing Pin Spring and a Wolff reduced power firing pin safety spring. It will come with the factory original parts, Glock Armorers tool, and Glock Armorers plate so you may re-install them if it suits you. With the parts installed, the trigger breaks clean, quick and crisp with no mush and has yet to misfire on any round I've fired. 

This has been my EDC handgun for quite a while, and I have maintained it meticulously since purchase. I am not sure how many rounds down the pipe it has, since I have trained with it as my EDC to keep my skills sharp but  the frame isn't marred, the slide shows very little holster wear, and the barrel is clean and the rifling is as sharp looking as new. I have over $750 invested in the handgun with the accessories included, and the only reason this is being sold is to fund a down-payment for a bike.
