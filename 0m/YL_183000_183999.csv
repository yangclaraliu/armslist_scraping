The gun is a dedicated built-from-the-ground-up .40 caliber - not an adaptation of a 9mm frame. They made it with an alloy frame, a double stack clone of the 1911 grip frame style, and the Sig-style locking system. It's only commonality with the CZ 75/85 series pistols lies in the use of the CZ 75/85 double/single action trigger, the CZ 75/85 sear blocking safety, and the CZ 75B magazines.
Colts bankruptcy put an end to this deal so CZ replaced the trigger in what was going to be the Colt Z40, made some other changes and sold them out through a few distributors. 
I have need of thinning my collection so this sorta rare CZ gets the axe. It has approximately 400 rounds through it. All were handloads and I had zero failures. It will come with a box, 2 mags and the loader.

The asking price is fair, I'm not one of those guys asking 600 bucks for a used glock police trade in (we've all seen those on here!)  Will I take a few bucks off so you can feel better and don't have to pay asking price? More than likely... will I take 20% off to dump it?  No.  

Not interested in selling it to a fake dealer that just wants to turn it for a profit.

Buds has a used one for $859, find yourself some used CT grips for 200, nice used wilson beavertail for 20 bucks, used grips screws for 5 bucks, FFL fees (and shipping charges if necessary) and you're over what I'm asking for it.  Plus, you can inspect this one before you buy it..."

Your welcome to handle mine and inspect my work.

I've only had the car for about a month. Took it in as a partial trade for my bike. Not a big El Camino fan myself. I don't know a lot about the car. I've been driving it for about a month. Mechanically, she needs 3 things (at least that I know of). First, there's and exhaust gasket leak on the right side of the engine at the header. The leaking noise goes away after about 5 minutes (once the metal in the engine gets hot and expands). Second, the radiator has formned a leak. It's not gushing out, but you have to keep an eye on the water level. Had the carb (quadrajet) rebuilt, the carb needs tuned. Other then that, the car is great. Just put new rubber on it. Had her aligned and they replaced the front left tie rod whatchamacallit (I'm a harley mechanic, not sure on car stuff). They said that everything else under the car looked great. Put on a new distributor cap and rotor on also. Speedo reads 49,355 miles.......I would assume it would be 145,355, but the car doesn't look or run like it. Body has some rough spots on it, but no dents or bangs. Bed is in great shape, no rust. Just needs repainted. Interior is also in pretty good shape. Has a couple cracks in the console. Someone put an aftermarket radio in it, then took it out........so there's no radio. The headliner isn't saging at all.....it's just a little faded. She's been a good car for the past few weeks, just looking for a regular pickup. Asking $4200 (obo), but would be willing to take a gun/guns as a partial trade. Plus, I'm a little flexible on the price.......but not a lot. Feel free to text me at REDACTED. Thanks for looking!!!"

It is a highly modified Saiga-12 semi-auto shotgun. 

The Saiga-12 is an AK-47 design 12g (AK-12?) made in Russia at the original Izmash where Kalashnikov still has his office. 

This one has been modified from it's 'sporting' import configuration.

Mods are:

It has the trigger group moved forward to the original location

New g2 trigger group installed. 

Moving the trigger group forward allows for the pistol grip to be installed. 

Has a custom vented handguard and custom made barrel shroud.

An AK builder trigger guard riveted on

A NATO length standard AK stock. 

Also has a Tromix muzzle brake and I will throw in a never mounted Chaos Porkypine 6 spike bayonet (a little too tactical for my taste but not made anymore, I got one of the last 50 when they went up for sale). 

Has a nice pro Duracoat finish.

It comes with the factory 5 round mag

2 10 round mags

And a 20 round drum mag. 

This thing fires so fast I have has 8 shells in the air at once, fired off 8 rounds before the first shell hit the ground.

Shoots any ammo you feed it since it had the ports reworked by the factory certified smithing shop. 

Nice balance and good looks. A very solid shotgun. Has about 200 rounds through it.

I have cash in hand and looking for a deal.  I am willing to travel approx 50 miles from NW Columbus to close a deal.  

The only possible trade I have is a 1955 Beretta 950bb, .22 short pocket pistol.  It is a cute little piece, excellent for a lady's purse for legal ccw carry.

(I know I am going to catch so much flack for this, but this is the only way I will sell it. I hope you can appreciate that I am doing my part to keep firearms out of the hands of people that should not own them. If you took the initiative to become a Law Enforcement Officer, or have a valid CCW, I will gladly sell to you. Of if you want to pay $20 to an FFL to do the transfer. )

What we have is a great Beretta 3032 Tomcat. It comes with all the original paperwork, matching serial numbers on the box, and a molded hard case. It also comes with 3 Beretta 3032 magazine ($40 each). I was told it has a crack on the frame, but the only thing I can find looks like a scratch. You are welcome to inspect it and/or take it to a gun smith. I called Beretta and talked with a man named ""Butch"" and he said I could send it in and if it is crack, he assured me he will ""make it right for any Beretta customer"" and you are welcome to verify this. 

From Beretta:

The 3032 Tomcat offers all the features of the 21 Bobcat. Both pistols have a snag-proof design that permits quick presentation to the target, a slide blade front sight for fast target acquisition, and a smooth, crisp trigger pull in double/single action.

QUALITY POCKET PISTOLS. 
The same dedication to advanced design, uncompromising quality and strict quality control that make the 92FS, Cougar and Cheetah such international standouts is found in all Beretta small caliber, pocket-size pistols. Simplicity, safety and practical use are their best qualities. 
PRACTICAL AND SIMPLE.
The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore quickly checked. Jamming and stovepiping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas. 

1) Barrel. Forged out of special high-strength steel; precisely rifled for accuracy. The Inox models feature stainless steel barrels.
2) Slide. Machined out of high-strength carbon steel and specially heat treated.
3) Sights. Notched rear sight and blade front sight for fast target acquisition.
4) Frame-mounted. Manual, conveniently thumb operated.
5) Contoured Tang. Top of the grip area is precisely curved and relieved to snugly accommodate the shooter’s hand, thus protecting the thumb web from being pinched by the slide and increasing the pistol control upon firing.
6) Frame. Made of a special alloy, noticeably stronger, lighter and more corrosion resistant than stainless steel. In all other models the frame is made of special aluminum alloy forgings and anodized black or gray.
7) Tip-up Barrel Latch.
8) Trigger Pull. Smooth, crisp pull in double/single action. 
9) Snag Proof Design. Smooth contours permit quick, smooth draw.

3032 TOMCAT. EXCELLENT POWER VS WEIGHT.
Stopping power, concealability and lightweight – that’s what the double-action Tomcat is all about. Using 60-grain .32 ACP (7.65 mm) hollow-point ammunition, this latest addition to Beretta’s small frame collection provides firepower equalling the punch of a .380 (9mm Short). Yet, all this serious capability is packed into a compact, lightweight 4.9” (125 mm), 14.5 ounce (400 gr.) package. A drift-adjustable rear sight provides for superior accuracy. Available in the Tritium version featuring the tritium luminous front sight in some countries. 

3032 TOMCAT INOX.
This new model has a stainless steel slide and barrel. The alloy frame is gray anodized to match the color and finish of the stainless components. The trigger, hammer, safety, magazine and other parts are blued. All other features are the same as the Tomcat. 



Thanks!

It has Bubinga Veneers. Donald still has this bow listed as sold on his website (http://www.assenheimer-bows.com/bows-for-sale.html)."

This gun is NOT the airweight model but the gun is very light and is a 5 shot. The gun comes with everything it came with bran new, a speed loader, and 327 rounds of ammo(150 rds of reloaded .38 special, 150 rds of reloaded .357 magnum, 20 rds of Hornady .38 Special +P, and 7 rds of CCI shot shell).  327 rds of ammo for $50 comes out to 15.2 cents a round or $7.50 a box(50 rds) at least half the price of regular target ammo. Permit to purchase or carry is a must.  Anyone emailing me asking to get the gun for a cheaper price (low ballers) will be ignored.

It was evaluated by Tucson Guns and Western Artifacts in 2009.  Direct quote from the appraisal: ""Remington side by side shotgun, serial number 64***, 12 guage.  This is a model 1889 Grade 1 shotgun made prior to 1900 with decarbonized Damascus barrels.  Mechanically, the shotgun is in excellent condition but the barrels are corroded and the overall value is estimated at $850"".  

The furniture is in good condition with scratches one would expect from 110+ year old piece, and the checkering is original and has not been re-cut.  The buttplate is the original hard rubber with the Remington Arms logo and all fasteners are original.  Perhaps a good Single Action Shooting Society piece?  Given its age, I would certainly have it examined by a professional gunsmith prior to firing.   $450.00.  Prefer to sell locally but would consider shipping to an FFL."

Security/Home Defense Model. 20-inch Barrel, 7+1 shots, 12 gauge pump. The original stock has been replaced with a Knoxx Blackhawk Recoil Reduction Stock. It has a flashlight mounted under the barrel with room for two more attachments. A tactical sling will be included, which holds 15 shells. The Blackhawk Stock also holds 5 shells and has a waterproof compartment for batteries, etc. I will include ALL of my ammunition, which is about 20 rounds of 00buckshot and over 100rounds of birdshot. The item will NOT come with a case and will NOT come with a cleaning kit.

It has had 8 rounds shot through it...it is virtually brand new! The item was fired BEFORE the stock was installed, so the stock has seen 0 action. The stock is designed to reduce the recoil up to 90% !!! This is useful if you are handy-capped or possibly for a young son/daughter. A 8 year-old could shoot this repeatedly with no problems. There is ONE and ONLY ONE very small problem with this gun. A couple of days ago I noticed VERY faint rustspots on the topside of the barrel. It is barely visible, so much so that I couldn't even take a decent picture of it. The local shop inspected it and said it could easily be removed with 00 Steel Wool and a little bit of gunoil. NOTHING HEAVIER THAN Double 00! It is a fairly easy process, but I do not feel comfortable performing it.

E-MAIL me if you wish to meet. I WILL be meeting at a police station. This gun is fully legal and I do not intend on selling it to just anybody.  Sorry for the blurry picture(s)!
