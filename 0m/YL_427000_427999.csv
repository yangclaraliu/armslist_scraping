This gun has been fired approx. 150 times, at the range, over the past 10 years or so. This is not an Elite IA or an Elite II but the more difficult to find Brigadier Elite I. I am also including an Unclle Mike's Side Kick Holster (Never Used) and 200 rounds of WInchester White Box Ammo. 

The Brigadier has a 60-gram (2.1 oz) heavier slide and 1 millimeter (0.039 in) wider to improve control when firing multiple shots in quick succession. It also includes removable front and rear sights.

The Elite I Pistols include the heavier Brigadier bruniton slide with front serrations and Elite designation, Inox finish (silver) stainless barrel, thin skeletonized hammer, and bevel of the magazine well. A flat hammer spring cap was standard as well as the decock only (G-Model) feature and dovetailed front sight. 

She is a beauty but I am streamlining my caliber line up and the 9mm's are going.  This is the last 9mm I have remaining and am having a little separation anxiety already.  I am always interested in 45 ACP and AR 15 (.223) trades with cash up or down based on what you have to trade.  Shoot me an offer before I change my mind.  FTF with ID for transaction please."

This was a limited edition issued in 2006 to commerate 50 years of the 44 mag cartridge.

The ruger blackhawk is notoriously strong to the point that several maximum loads are recommended only for ruger revolvers, this makes them a favorite of hand loaders and hunters.

This revolver has a 6.5"" barrel and a steel grip frame (not aluminum like on current production) and features gold roll marking on the barrel.

Being a collectable item it has been fed >250 rounds in its life and has no dings or damage of any kind. There is a slight cylinder draw line, but that is expected for a revolver of this style in a blued finish.

Is was my camping back up for many years, and I'd rather have a shooter, not a collectors piece.

I'm wanting to trade for another 44 mag. I really want a ruger redhawk, but I'd consider a s&w 29, 629 or (maybe) a Taurus raging bull.

This is a collectable early model Desert Eagle. If you don't know the ""Deagle"" brand has changed hands a few times since its inception in the 80's. This Is the original Desert Eagle in .357 before the 50AE  version ever existed. Yes its not nearly as powerful as the 44 or 50, but have you priced a box of 50 compared to 357? what im trying to say is that this is much more pleasurable and cheaper to shoot.....and no it doesn't shoot 38 special if that's what you were thinking. This thing is in almost 100 percent condition, and functions flawlessly....its been a safe queen. I just put 20rds down the tube last weak to make sure its all good....it is. And i cleaned it, I'll show you how to take it down if your interested. 

Anyway it will come with two 9rd magazines, that's all.....I don't have the box. Shoulda held on to that...oh well. Hindsight is 20/20. I'm Mainly looking for high-end 1911's, and custom or collectable firearms. I have a weakness for S&W performance shop firearms. 45acp is king in my book. I'm also on the prowl for a nice UZI, preferably IMI. I may be able to scrounge up some cash for the right trade. Let me know what you have...Mutigun trades are welcome. I'm only interested in selling it if you want to pay the Blue book price.....even then i'm much more interested in a trade. I'll trade down in price ( for the right gun) if you make up the difference.


IF THIS IS STILL UP ITS STILL FOR TRADE!"

It has an unknown brand 3 prong style flash hider as well. If you want, it'll come with an old tasco 4x32 on quick dismount rings that I had sitting around, but show obvious wear, but the scope is still completely functional. 2 factory 7 round mags and 1 aftermarket 11 or 12 rounder. I was told by the previous owner it had less than 500 rounds through, and I've only personally put about 30 or so through it with no problems function wise, but the factory wood stock cracked, hence the new choate. the cracked stock and original buffer and spring are yours if you want them for whatever reason. These things are a blast to shoot and an awesome plinker for those who want a bit more pop than a 22.

-1911s in stainless and .45ACP only.
-Kimber Eclipse Custom II (Target or regular model)
-Ruger SR1911
-Springfield Range Officer
-Colt 1911s. Preferably the ones with the rear serrations that run diagonal.
-Arsenal AK-47
-Other interesting tactical rifles.

I may consider other pistols, such as XDMs, Beretta 92/96s etc. If your offer is less than the value of my AR-15, add the difference along with the gun(s) of your trade until the trade is a little more even.

Trade value for the DPMS is around $900/OBO but I will not give this nice rifle away. The gun has had only three magazines through it, has no scratches, marks or blemishes of any kind. The DPMS has a MagPul MOE Handguard set, MagPul pistol grip, and a MagPul pop up sight in the rear.

I know very little about the rifle. The mother-in-law would like it sold or trade (for a pistol she can use). The story behind it is that it has been in the family for years. It probably hasn't been fired in 15 years. I don't believe the stock it original but a sporter stock made by Pachmayr, white line stock. Sights seem to be new and in good shape, made by Williams. Any questions please ask, but as I said I know ever little about the rifle."

American military cartridge of the late 1800's and early 1900's.  It is basically between a bit more than a 308 but less than a 30-06, and only slightly less than an 8x57.  this gun has matching barrel and receiver and bolt, rare for an Argentine as the bolts usually don't match.  The stock is a different serial number but close.  It retains all the stock cartouches, handguard, sling mounts and swivels, buttplate, and also the removable ""late"" bayonet lug adapter to use the larger sword type bayonet.  The bore is excellent, no pits, no bulges, just some lead and powder buildup residue. Argentine Mausers are usually collectors finds because they were hardly used and typically only have handling nicks and scratches. this is one of them.   Needs nothing but ammo and go shooting, and it displays quite nicely.    30"" barrel has not been counterbored or cut in any way.  The price is $350, add $35 for shipping on east coast, or $45 on west coast.  If your FFL requires shipping from an FFL on my end, I will arrange that for an additional $10.  Hawaii and Alaska shipping is $85 from my FFL, or $75 direct to your FFL from me.  EMAIL FOR MANY CLEAR PICTURES OF BORE AND SERIAL NUMBERS AND STOCK MARKINGS.

Note finish wear from holster on sharp/high edges and finish wear from holster snap on right side below and behind ejection port.  I bought this pistol from a local gun shop on November 11, 2009 and have cared for it meticulously since then, cleaning it thoroughly and lubricating it lightly after every range session.  I have put approximately 250 rounds through it.  Serial numbers on frame, slide, barrel and box all match.  The bore is bright and shiny.  As shown in pictures, it comes with 2 magazines and the factory Sig-Sauer box.  High resolution pictures are available on request.

It has never been fired. 
Purchased at Bullet Stop in Mar 2012 for $555.88. The price tag is on the box with matching serial number.

It has been Cerakoted in a custom digital camo pattern with the ""Punisher"" emblem incorporated on both sides of the grip.

The gun, both barrels and factory magazines are coated.

It comes with- Box, paperwork, 2 13rd 40S&W factory mags, 1 15rd factory magazine, brand new Tru-Glo Tritium night sights, Lone Wolf 40-9 threaded conversion barrel with thread protector, factory 40S&W barrel, 1 33rd aftermarket 9mm mag, 1 15rd aftermarket 40S&W mag, and 1 15rd aftermarket 9mm mag.

Also has Ghost X-Mag extended mag release, Ghost Bullet extended slide release, Lone Wolf extended takedown lever, Lone Wolf frame plug, and a Ghost stainless guide rod.

The barrels have had the feed ramps polished.

All parts and coating was done by a professional licensed gunsmith, not a wannabe garage/basement hack. I have the receipt if you want to see it. He took a picture (shown below) and submitted it to Cerakote for their website gallery.

This is a great 2 caliber package and a great looking gun. There is no other like it. 

Bought all of this this for my son's birthday, but he was hit by a drunk driver 2 months ago in Texas, and is now unable to use any firearms, due to his injuries. So, I have finally decided to take a loss and sell it, or trade it for something different.

The gun, gunsmith work and Cerakote cost $875.00. I will sell this for 700 FIRM, or trade plus cash for the same 700 value.
NOT HURTING FOR CASH. 

I have been told that there are a lot of Armslist users that perceive guns to be worthless after they have left the store. I will not entertain any offers for less than my asking price. you cannot buy this gun with all of the upgrades for anywhere near what I am asking for it, and if you can, great!, there is no sense in you making any offer.

I would be interested in trading for a different compact 9mm, 1911 type 9mm, or a tactical type .22 pistol. Plus cash depending. 

Please do not offer me a used personally fired gun for a retail price or a no receipt ""hacksmith"" upgraded pistol. Mine is brand new unfired other than factory test, and the internals prove it.

Remington has discontinued this fine Italian made over/under shotgun and that makes this a collectors gun for sure.  Please contact me if you need to see pictures of the actual gun.

Typically I like to shoot my 1911's but I'm pretty sure this has not had more than the factory rounds through it, so I feel guilty wearing it in - it feels like it should be preserved and I'm just not that kind of person.  It's in fantastic shape and only has a little wear in the bluing on the front of the slide from being in the box (hard to see in photos because it's so minor.  There is also a tiny nick below the trigger on the trigger guard on the ejection side.  It's small but I have photos to show it.  The serial # puts it at 1976 and the gun is tight and smooth - they just don't make them like this anymore!   I would call this a 99% gun and hopefully the photos show it.  The bore is shiny and appears to he never had any rounds down the tube.  I have several high resolution photos that I can email to anyone in case these photos don't do it justice.

The gun comes with the original styrofoam inside box (not cardboard box) and paperwork from 1976!  It also came with a screwdriver tool and the bushing tool from Colt.  Again, this is truly a piece of history.  Though I would prefer to do a cash transaction, I am open to partial trades for cash and another 1911 that I can shoot and not devalue in the process!! :)

I'm also interested in trades for a Dillon 1050 press or maybe a 50BMG rifle of some sort.
