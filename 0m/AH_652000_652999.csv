Was giving this in a trade. The previous owner bought it after his house got robbed. He bought it sat it in the closet and never fired it. If you know about shot guns this is a great affordable home defense gun. Made in china it is a Remington clone. Has a 18.5"" smooth bore barrel that is thick you can put thousands of rounds thru this and it will not mess up the barrel. 5 in the tube 1 in the chamber its a 6 shot, shotgun. The great thing about the chinese cloning these shotguns after Remington's is that you can use all after market parts for rem's on this gun. I replaced the stock with a extra Remington synthetic stock and pump I was trying to sell I was gona put a tube extension on it for the deal but when I put it on it went out further then the barrel so I took it off.

Well as the tittle says I'm looking to buy a s&w 15-22 I'm not looking to spend any more than 400 for a used rifle when I can just go on and buy a new one retail price. So that's why I'm on this website looking for some kind of deal. $400.00 isn't a bad price so if you got something on the line send me an e-mail. Must be a threaded barel. many thanks again

I have been informed I'm the 3rd owner and the person who traded this to me said he only put 60 rounds down the barrel. I have the original case, lock, two 15 round mags, papers, back and side straps, and gun. This gun has a manufacture date on the case of 2010, is SA/DA with decocker, thumb safety, and Tru Dot Night Sights (still have some nice glow to them). The SA trigger is really smooth and the gun is a joy to shoot. This was my first H&K and I'd like to keep this, but just need something a bit smaller/thinner. 

Located in Garner (Raleigh area) and the value is $775. I'm primarily interested in something WITH night sights. My top trade choices would be a Glock 19 with night sights or Glock 26 (must be 9mm). I'm also mildly interested in shooting a Taurus 24/7 G2 Compact. I'm open for offers, but please be mindful that I'd really like something with night sights and you might need to include some $$ to make up the value difference. No long guns please, and I'd like to keep this FTF and local to the Raleigh area. I'm certainly willing to drive a reasonable distance, but have no urgency to rid myself of this gun and drive 3 hours to do so.  ALL NC Law's will be followed."

I probably have 500-1k 45 lead bullets that i purchased from target world in Cincinnati, 500-1k in 9mm, and I think about 100 223 copper bullets to go with it. I have small and large primers, probably in the 1000-3000 range total. I have powder, lead bars for the casting, case tumbler with crushed corn cob, case cleaning agent, case lube.  it comes with a single stage press for lubrasizing. The progressive lee loader has the case feeder tube, bullet feeder tube (i never used the bullet feeder because I liked setting the bullet myself, sort of my way of quality control) it has the primer feeder, it has the deprimed catch built into the loader. It has everything. Works perfect, I currently have it all cleaned and broken down because I am moving from the Greene county area to West Va. and I acquired a Dillon this past month which is already waiting for me in WV. This set up is 100% complete and ready to be set up and go.

Now I have a large handgun and riffle collection and would like to get some offers for my XD45 (4.5'' - im almost positive, again i didn't shoot it, just constantly cleaned and oiled it) w/ a lasermax laser. And i have a Px4 Storm 9mm. Both these guns were babied, They were used at the range by my fiancé at the time. She's gone and I am a 1911 shooter so these have done nothing but added to my pile of guns to keep oiled and cleaned. 

I do not need money. You can never have too many guns, but if someone offers me a fair trade I will consider it."

The Drag Bag can be carried by the reinforced carry handles, dragged on the ground by the drag loop or can be used as a back-pack. To use as a backpack, simply remove the padded backpack straps from the concealment pocket and snap into place. (end of desc.)

What does it mean for you? Purchasing a Thompson/Center ICON® rifle means you are buying a rifle that already delivers three shots in an inch at 100 yards. Every ICON® earns this distinction or better before it leaves our facility.

ICON’s superior accuracy starts with our technologies, specifically the Interlock Bedding System, Integra Base and T/C’s superior barrel technology with 5R® rifling. These features, along with our superior craftsmanship and attention to detail, make every ICON the best choice for your next hunt.
