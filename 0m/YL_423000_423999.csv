To open it you simply lay your fingers on the top of it in whatever combination you choose your fingers to lay and the springloaded door pops open giving you access to your firearm and valuables. The Gunsafe can be mounted to a nighstand , in a drawer, under a bed or in your car for those times when you cant carry your weapon or whastever it may be. This safe again has been opened but includes all papers and keys for backup if batteries fail and I only want 75.00 for it and it retails for double that. Ive seen them sale as cheap as 129.00 but never 75.00 so dont miss out.Wont last long. Ill ship it anywhere at buyers expense.
I have five of them mounted in different places around my house.
This particular one I am selling is the last of the new ones.This one was actually a display that I bought from a shop that went out of business and is still new but has been opened and programmed but never mounted. It comes with all instructions and keys, mounting template and has factory warranty and works and looks like brand new. Better than new because it comes with batteries. Lol

 Parlor pistols and rifles (zimmerschutzen from German, ""room marksman"" or ""room shoot"") were popularized in the mid to late 19th Century, particularly in the Germanic countries, as a way to entertain guests, have family fun, and to increase one's shooting skills. Generally heavy barreled and often elaborately engraved rifles (zimmerbusche) were produced for clearly upscale clients. These generally used a Flobert (CB-Cap) cartridge chambered a few inches from the muzzle. Sometimes equally elaborate parlor pistols (zimmerpistole) were chambered for Flobert cartridges or simply used a percussion cap. In this country, a small, almost toylike parlor pistol was briefly manufactured by Remington in 1860.

Email me what you have in mind and I will reply if interested. Also keep in mind the Keltec PMR 30 is hard to come by and seems to go for close to $700 when available. Thanks

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game."

It's a commander sized barrel/slide on an officer sized frame to put it in some other 1911 terms you may be familiar with.  This 1911 is ideal for CCW as it has Para's LDA trigger which is their ""Light Double Action"" trigger.  It is DAO and is smooth and consistent.  It's arguably one of the best DAO triggers out there and the best I've ever personally shot. This gun also has a spurless hammer so it cant snag on clothing when being drawn under stress.  It doesn't have to be carried condition 1 or ""cocked and locked"" like some are nervous about with most 1911's.  Get all the safety and piece of mind that the polymer wonder guns offer in the classic beauty of the 1911 platform. The round count on this gun is about 400 rounds.  It's been shot very little as it's a special edition I hadn't shot or carried it much.  It does show some very slight holster wear on the slide near the muzzle, carried it probably a dozen times.

Comes with 2 7 round Para OEM mags that work flawlessly and 2 sets of grips, black ones(wood I think) and also the more refined Para OEM Special Edition Coco Bolo wood grips that are on it.  It has a match grade bull barrel that is a bushingless design and shoots very well.  I JUST had the gun at Para to be looked over by a Para gunsmith to ensure the firearm is GTG for the buyer.  Everything checked out fine.  While the gun was there I had them replace the PXT extractor (that has been known to break) with their new revised model EGW extractor that is more like the standard 1911 extractor.  More pictures available on request.




I will also include with the sale the original hardcase and all paperwork that came with it when new.  Another item included will be a Tucker Gun Leather holster that was custom molded for a CCO 1911.  It's a Kydex outer with cowhide leather interior.  The best of both worlds, the holster is over $100 new and has a wait time of weeks."

CAI   L1A1 on Imbel  rcvr. Sporter .308, your basic model. 1 metric mag(20rnd), 1 inch mag(10 rnd) ON ORDER, railed cover and standard cover, rear sight is flip up.

It is compliant as it sits. If you change the stock you may have to add American parts to make 922 compliant. You""ll  have to check. I took this on a trade. I am not really wanting a semi- auto, but I have to admit the more I shoot it the more I like it. I have completely taken apart and cleaned, checked headspacing, and gas piston for straightness, checked and cleaned springs and then took to the range and shot three boxes of ammo through it to check functionality.The sights are timed to barrel. The iron sights shoot about 4""-5"" high at 50 yds. I used Federal .308 150grn and Priv .308 150grn, and Winchester silver box .308 180grn. All soft point since I wanted to check with hunting ammo. Shot great, no failure to feed or eject on setting 4 on gas block. Did not damage the brass casings. I shot groups of 2"" at 50' but I wasn't really trying and all I have is cheap glass. I am sure it can do better. I have the standard top cover also and 100 rnds of Wolf .308 to go with it. All as a package. I realize it is inch pattern and all I have is one Metric mag , but it dosen't seem to care. It works fine. I don't need emails about the price, you either want it or you don't. It is a good dual purpose rifle, if you know what I mean. I also have a 10 round inch mag coming from Midway on backorder I will send to you when it gets here(due in July). No fees, no transfers, no shipping. Bill of sale, I ask you the questions and prove residency and you will have to come pick up.

They are machine pulled, .223 bullets in 55 grain, the military M193's.
The reason I call them seconds is that I wasn't happy with this lot as I found up to 40% of them are out of round at the base. That said, many of them are fine machine pulled bullets and if I didn't already have a bunch of .223 bullets I would load these myself for short range , beer can shooting, gravel pit fun and general blasting fun.
Selling in one lot of 1,500. Pick up is in Tacoma or shipping with Paypal is $6.
I did my best with a couple pictures, the pictures show a few out of round, this was a random set of bullets.  Expect about 40% a little out of round, you may get fewer, but I am lowering expectations so hopefully your happy when you get them.   i have other items at my site www.upammosupply.com

I am selling this rifle because I no longer need it for the reasons I purchased it.  I lived in a violent and dangerous area in the middle of the Narco wars, some people call in Phoenix Arizona.  This was purchased for home defense, far more effective than the old school 870. The 223 with soft point bullets don't over penetrate like most cartridges and 30 rounds means you will have the firepower to stay in it.    It has 460 rounds through it,  I am a reloader and it is easy for me to track my shooting, 400 were reloads, 40 were varmint type light bullet soft points and 20 of the M855 penetrators.

The money will help my family get settled in our new home in Wisconsin, this is a great deal if you are looking for an AR.  Piston driven, awesome trigger and like all Rugers built like a brick S#$*House."

It is in the case in the same condition as it was the day I purchased it new.

My gun really is unfired and as good as purchasing a new gun.  

Comes with Sig Hard case, case lock, 2 magazines etc.

The SIG SAUER® P220® defines accuracy – and reliability – in a .45ACP. But many SIG shooters have asked for a P220 with a longer slide, one that would compete head-to-head with other five inch barreled 45's. The result? The first P220 Match prototype went to our testing range where it shot an eight-round group measuring 0.64” at 20 yards. Our engineers after extensive review concluded that this was a good starting point.

The P220 Match Elite adds the most sought after features to the P220 Match - beavertail stainless frame, front strap checkering, adjustable target rear sight with glow in the dark night sight in the front.  SIG's innovative Short Reset Trigger (a DA/SA trigger system with a 60% reduction in trigger reset) and black anodize aluminum grips. 

The P220 Match Elite defines the new standard in .45ACP performance.

I would consider a trade for a Dan Wesson 1911 in 45 ACP.

CCW holders preferred, must have OH driver's license and be willing to sign bill of sale for the purchase of this firearm."

I love the rifle, but recently fell in love with the AR platform, so I’m putting this out to see what kind of trades I might be able to get, or to sell outright if the right price comes along.  These RAA Saiga Main Battle Rifles in .308/7.62x51 are HARD to find, they shoot great, excellent accuracy, and will run no matter what you feed them, though this one has ONLY been fed brass ammunition.  

I do not need to get rid of this rifle, so no low ball offers please.  If something good doesn’t come along, I’ll just keep it!  I won’t separate items (sorry, too much of a pain to sell separately).  Trade value is $1175/$1200 for total package.

The package includes:

1 x RAA Saiga .308 Main Battle Rifle (AK-47) w/chrome lined barrel, three magazines (8 round, 20 round, 25 round), TAPCO stock, Intrafuse rail, fore grip w/bi-pod (push of a button, comes out), two optics mounts (quick release), Red Dot (Tasco ProPoint PDTS132).  410 rounds of .308 ammunition.

This rifle is LNIB, and appears to have only been fired at the factory.   It is in excellent condition!

This was shipped to me by a pawn shop off gunbroker.  They listed it as the Glock magazine version, and it wasn't.  My loss is your gain.

This gun will accept Sig P226, Beretta 92/M9, and SW Model 59 magazines, as I have the mag release blocks for all three.  They are designed by KelTec to be easily interchangeable, and can be swapped out by unscrewing two small set screws on the magazine release button.  

This thing makes the perfect truck gun, as it'll extend your max effective range all the way to 150 yards.    Shortly after this came in, I got my hands on the Glock mag variant, and I absolutely love it!   

If you own a SW59, Beretta or Sig P226, then this rifle is the perfect complement to your carry weapon, as not only the ammo is interchangeable, but so are your magazines.  Super High Capacity Magazines (30 rounders) are available online for the Beretta, SW and Sig options at websites such as CDNNinvestments.com, or cheaperthandirt.com, which will allow you to run with some serious firepower in this carbine.  This thing will fold in half, and measures a whopping 16 inches long!  Fits in a backpack, a laptop bag and even into some of the larger camelback pouches!  Perfect trail hiking gun, survival gun, etc.   Why take that Henry stowaway 22 when you can pack the punch of a 9mm rocketing out of a 16 inch barrel!  It packs the same terminal ballistics as a 357 at the muzzle, due to the increased barrel length!

Must have valid Photo ID and be over the age of 18 to buy.  Must be willing to sign a bill of sale in order to buy this gun. 

I'm asking $475 for this gun, as that's about $50 under what I've got in it. 

Rifle will convey with the Kel Tec box, manual, lock tool, receiver screw tool, (1) Sig P226 adapter, (1)Beretta adapter, (1) SW adapter, (1)SW 10rd mag, and I'll even throw in (4) Beretta mags as well.  

Grab yourself this solid little assault rifle before the election feeding frenzy on guns and ammo takes off!  

Thanks, hope to hear from you!


Local FTF only please.  The only trade offer that I may be interested in is a Glock 21 or 21SF, in good condition."

Ranges your target
Calculates your trajectory
Illuminates your perfect holdover 

No more guessing yardage or fumbling with a shaky handheld rangefinder. No more losing sight of your trophy. No more guessing holdover. The Eliminator knows the precise horizontal distance to your trophy and exactly what your cartridge will do. Eliminator lights a 1/3 MOA illuminated aiming dot showing exactly where your shot will go. With The Eliminator, just Range, Aim, and Fire.

Starting with the field-proven and bright crystal-clear optics of the original Burris LaserScope, The Eliminator provides a sophisticated yet very simple and accurate means of tailoring the scope’s trajectory compensation to virtually any cartridge. 

Sophisticated Technology Made Simple, Simple, Simple.

Simply enter one of the 123 drop numbers into the Eliminator. In a split second, the Eliminator factors in the distance, the angle of the shot, and the ballistics of your cartridge or load, and presents a lighted dot for the perfect holdover.

Ballistics Tables Made Simple

All you need to know is the drop in inches at 200 yards when sighted-in at 50 yards, or the drop in inches at 500 yards when your cartridge is sighted-in for 100 or 200 yards. Burris provides this ‘drop number’ for more than 1,900 commercial cartridges. With your drop number established, you decide if you need or prefer to sight-in at 50, 100 or 200 yards.


Programming Made Simple

1. First, push the Main Button (left side of scope) to turn on the electronics. Then push the Main Button once more to get three dashes (— — —) in the range area.

2. Next, push the Forward Arrow button (right side of scope) then the Main Button. Hold simultaneously for 6 seconds to enter Set-Up Mode.

3. Select either (Y)ards or (M)eters, press the forward button.

4. Select a (0) 50 yard sight-in, (1) 100 yard sight-in distance or (2) 200 yard sight-in distance, then press the forward button.

5. Select the two-digit Drop Number (04 thru 90) and press the back button. You’re done!

Precision Made Simple

Sight-in your gun at your selected sight-in distance of either 50, 100 or 200 yards. Then verify point of impact by actual shooting at 200 or 500 yards. Depending on the exact ammo performance, your gun’s barrel length, the elevation, and any extreme temperatures, you might need to increase or decrease your Drop Number by a couple of digits for exacting performance. 

Life Made Simple

Your programming is stored in the scope no matter the condition of your battery and it will still remember your programming with no battery at all. 

The Hunt Made More Enjoyable and Successful

The Burris Eliminator LaserScope is in a league of its own. No other riflescope combines this level of quality, technology, accuracy, simplicity, repeatability and effectiveness. It will greatly increase the distance at which you can be confident in making an ethical shot. You do the hunting and shooting, the Eliminator will do the memorizing and calculating. The Eliminator is affordable and of a size and weight that’s welcome for everyday field use. The revolutionary new Eliminator is a brilliant riflescope innovation that ensures long range hunting success.

I'm interested in selling or trading my FNH FNP-45. Cash can go either way. I have both the chrome slide FNP, and the tactical version, and I don't need both. I'm only interested in selling or trading the chrome slide FNP at this point. Its in excellent condition, and has never had a malfunction. The pistol comes with three 14RD magazines, the original case, two interchangeable back plates for the grip, CoBIS casing, manual, and FNH gun lock. Those of you who know FN, know that it is one of the highest quality firearms that money can buy. Reviews show that this gun is unbelievably reliable and has noticibly lower recoil than the competition(Glock 21, Springfield XD). Reviews will also show that these triggers are phenomenal. One of the only negative things I have ever heard about this gun, is that the grip frame is rather large. I have medium sized hands, and I dont feel that it is too large at all, in fact I use the larger back strap. The positive side of a large grip frame is that it holds so much ammunition. You can get factory mags that hold 15 rounds, which is REALLY impressive in a .45 I clean my pistols meticulously after every time they are used. Willing to travel anywhere inside state lines.

First up is a Magpul AFG2. I had it on my rifle for a bit and switched it out for a FDE one. It is in perfect condition, has original packaging, and not getting used so I'd like to get 25 for it.

Next up is a Magpul STR stock in black. This was just recently swapped out in favor of a UBR. The stock is fantastic and has an awesome cheek weld. It also has storage tubes that will fit batteries. This is also in perfect condition and I would like to get 75 for it.

Lastly is an EoTech 552. This was on my rifle and was replaced with a new Micro T-1. The sight is in great condition and functions flawlessly. This is the NV capable sight. Has the original box and papers and extra batteries. My price for this is going to be 375.
