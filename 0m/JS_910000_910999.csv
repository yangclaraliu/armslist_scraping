NEW YORK CUSTOMERS: Legal analysis holds that the Hammerhead, which was declared to be ""not a pistol grip"" by the state of California, would also match that description in New York state.

SAIGA 12 gauge,"springfield, Springfield, Missouri",$ 140,"Listed On: Monday, February 11, 2013",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"2 or more for $135- I will ship- but stop asking me to ship to illiegal states.
Shipping flat rate- 1-4 drums is $20     More than 4 drums is $26

Prices are FIRM.... lowballers- don't waste my time
these come with BOTH a black and a clear back cover!

Saiga 12 drum magazine

Brand new in unopened package.

Below info is from MDs website
Lifetime Warranty! 

Imitated but very far from duplicated!

What sets the MD-20 apart from others?

Tried and proven design with real time use!

Unequaled reliability and durability!

Less friction from moving parts and feedlips!

At 2 lbs, the MD-20 is close to 6 ounces lighter than the imitator. And even though our drum is much lighter it is still stronger because it's weight was added for strength while the imitator's weight was added for low cost, ease of manufacturing.

Design Simplicity, 3 moving & 15 total parts!

Easier to load the MD-20 from the top than it is to use the imitator's load assist.

Locks into gun tight with virtually no movement!

The MD-20's rear cover is recessed in the drum body protecting it's locking points and better reinforcing both cover and body. 

Our smoke cover is usable in much lower light conditions than the imitator.

The MD-20 is the best because it was built because we personally wanted it for ourselves, not just to have another item to sale to the masses...

The MD-20, Saiga-12 drum mag is made of only the best materials available. It loads 2 3/4inch shells and has a simple design with very few moving parts for the utmost in reliability, durability, and ease of maintenance. Our drum is made entirely in the USA! The MD-20 can be stored loaded!

Please note: Some Saiga-12's will require fitting of the mag due to inconsistent factory tolerance of the gun. If your mag doesn't lock into your gun please carefully read your MD-20 User's Guide provided with every mag and also watch our fitting video by clicking this FITTING VIDEO LINK. This is super simple to do. Just read, watch, and understand BEFORE you fit. Not all Saiga-12's will require you to fit the mag.

Also depending on your gun's factory gas block and factory gas plug you may have problems cycling SOME high brass ammos from our drum. And the Promag drum is just the same but has a weaker feed... The factory gas plug offers a very low range of adjustment, especially considering how much 12ga ammo varies in power. Some 12ga ammos over gas the Saiga-12. And some Saiga-12's are a lot worse than others with a much wider range of ammo that will over gas it. There is a simple and cheap fix to all of this no matter what your gun's system is like. The MD Arms V-Plug. It installs in minutes simply by unscrewing the factory plug and screwing the V-Plug back in it's place. If you only change one thing about your Saiga-12 the V-Plug should be it to prevent premature failure of gun parts no matter what ammo or mags you use."

Edit: I apologize as I don't think I can be too flexible on the price at this point as I've already had a TON of inquiries on this item. (Maybe I should put that under the BAD column?)

The Bad: 
If you're a MN resident then we need to transfer through an FFL.  I'm willing to meet most places on the eastern side of the state as I'm from WI.  I would also be willing to trade for various handguns or any other offers but cash is best.

If you saw this advertised on a gun auction board, you'd see the word ""rare"" in the heading.

Built by Marty Bordson when he worked at Dakota Arms around 2001, one of 100 he built for them.  First sold to George Gardner at GA Precision who put 200 rounds through it (info gotten directly through email and PMs).  It was then sold to Doug (name withheld) who put 250 rounds through it.  I bought it this past February - 2012 -  and have put 215 rounds downrange (for 665 rounds total, reasonable estimates are of another 1500+ round barrel life), most of that OCW/load development, although I did stretch it out a little a few days ago down at Central Virginia Tactical, tagging torsos at 1225 yards with ease and about 1.5 - 1.7 mil hold for a 10-12 mph crosswind.   I shot 50 S&B loads (250gr SMKs) which ballistics data tell me were moving ABOUT 2590 fps.  I also shot 50 handload 285 grain Hornadys which chronograph data tell me were moving around 2750 fps (close to factory data), but actual ballistics data put the velocity closer to 2600 fps with similar data as the 250s, almost as flat.  Of course, with your loads, YMMV.

If there's a place you can shoot to 3,000 yards, this is the gun to do it.

Here's what comes with the deal:

- Dakota T-76 Longbow 
- 28 inch threaded (3/4-24) for brake/can, 1/10 twist barrel
- McMillan A-3 stock
- Adjustable trigger set at 2-1/4 lbs (measured on an RCBS gage)
- 4"" Atlas Picatinney base @ fore-end accepts Harris and Atlas bipods
- Stock, Dakota 20 MOA steel base AND a custom-made Ken Farrell Steel 40 MOA base as shown on the gun.
- .338 brass cleaning jag and two brushes 
- an aluminum hardshell case.

This gun has a LOT of potential for anyone who wants to get into the .338 Lapua Magnum.

$2750- OBO - includes S&H/insurance FEDEX ground to CONUS addresses.  I'll do FTF transfer for Maryland residents."

Instructor Qualifications:

Full Time Police Officer
Police Firearms Instructor
NRA Pistol Instructor
Concealed Carry Instructor since 2007
30 years Firearms Experience



I have real-world experience and teach from that perspective. I add to the basic curriculum to help better prepare students for the challenges of concealed carry and the potential use of deadly force.

We cover Concealed Carry law, Laws related to Self Defense and Deadly Force, Liability, Basic Marksmanship, Care and Maintenance, Weapon Selection, Holster Selection, Methods of Carry, Armed Response / Self Defense tactics, Interaction with Law Enforcement and much more.

This is an excellent class taught by a knowledgeable instructor with a bit more than the average CCH Instructor. 

My instruction is based on proven and experienced technique and instruction and not 'as seen on TV' pseudo tactic-cool.

I have the opportunity to interact with many Concealed Carry Permit holders and have found that many times the information they received was inaccurate and sometimes dangerous.

I believe in Concealed Carry and the right to self defense and that is why I teach. If you are wanting to carry a firearm, just be sure you ask questions of your instructor; their philosophy and true credentials. It is easy to become concealed carry instructor, but it takes experience in armed conflict and full knowledge of the law to offer what is really required.

It is possible that your life, or in the case of a wrong decision your liberty, will depend on the quality and accuracy of the instruction you receive. No matter what class you take, check the credentials of the instructor. Please! For Your Sake.

This ban includes not only ""assault rifles,"" but also numerous handguns and shotguns, and of course, magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.  In other words, this isn't really an ""assault weapons"" ban as much as it is a gun ban!

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)—author of the federal “assault weapon” and “large” ammunition magazine ban of 1994-2004—has announced that on Thursday Jan 24th she will introduce a bill to which her 1994 ban will pale by comparison. On Dec. 17th, Feinstein said, “I have been working with my staff for over a year on this legislation” and “It will be carefully focused.” Indicating the depth of her research on the issue, she said on Dec. 21st that she had personally looked at pictures of guns in 1993, and again in 2012.

According to a Dec. 27th posting on Sen. Feinstein's website and a draft of the bill obtained by NRA-ILA, the new ban would, among other things, adopt new definitions of ""assault weapon"" that would affect a much larger variety of firearms, require current owners of such firearms to register them with the federal government under the National Firearms Act, and require forfeiture of the firearms upon the deaths of their current owners. Some of the changes in Feinstein's new bill are as follows:

""Reduces, from two to one, the number of permitted external features on various firearms"".  The 1994 ban permitted various firearms to be manufactured only if they were assembled with no more than one feature listed in the law. Feinstein’s new bill would prohibit the manufacture of the same firearms with even one of the features.

""Adopts new lists of prohibited external features"". 
For example, whereas the 1994 ban applied to a rifle or shotgun the ""pistol grip"" of which ""protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon,"" the new bill would drastically expand the definition to include any ""grip . . . or any other characteristic that can function as a grip."" Also, the new bill adds ""forward grip"" to the list of prohibiting features for rifles, defining it as ""a grip located forward of the trigger that functions as a pistol grip."" Read literally and in conjunction with the reduction from two features to one, the new language would apply to every detachable-magazine semi-automatic rifle. At a minimum, it would, for example, ban all models of the AR-15, even those developed for compliance with California’s highly restrictive ban.

""Carries hyperbole further than the 1994 ban"". 
Feinstein's 1994 ban listed ""grenade launcher"" as one of the prohibiting features for rifles. Her 2013 bill carries goes even further into the ridiculous, by also listing ""rocket launcher."" Such devices are restricted under the National Firearms Act and, obviously, are not standard components of the firearms Feinstein wants to ban. Perhaps a subsequent Feinstein bill will add ""nuclear bomb,"" ""particle beam weapon,"" or something else equally far-fetched to the features list.

""Expands the definition of ""assault weapon"" by including"":
Three very popular rifles: The M1 Carbine (introduced in 1944 and for many years sold by the federal government to individuals involved in marksmanship competition), a model of the Ruger Mini-14, and most or all models of the SKS.

Any ""semiautomatic, centerfire, or rimfire rifle that has a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds,"" except for tubular-magazine .22s.

Any ""semiautomatic, centerfire, or rimfire rifle that has an overall length of less than 30 inches,"" any ""semiautomatic handgun with a fixed magazine that has the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds,"" and any semi-automatic handgun that has a threaded barrel.

""Requires owners of existing ""assault weapons"" to register them with the federal government under the National Firearms Act (NFA)"". 
The NFA imposes a $200 tax per firearm, and requires an owner to submit photographs and fingerprints to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE), to inform the BATFE of the address where the firearm will be kept, and to obtain the BATFE’s permission to transport the firearm across state lines.

""Prohibits the transfer of “assault weapons.”.
Owners of other firearms, including those covered by the NFA, are permitted to sell them or pass them to heirs. However, under Feinstein’s new bill, “assault weapons” would remain with their current owners until their deaths, at which point they would be forfeited to the government.

""Prohibits the domestic manufacture and the importation of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition"".
The 1994 ban allowed the importation of such magazines that were manufactured before the ban took effect. Whereas the 1994 ban protected gun owners from errant prosecution by making the government prove when a magazine was made, the new ban includes no such protection. The new ban also requires firearm dealers to certify the date of manufacture of any >10-round magazine sold, a virtually impossible task, given that virtually no magazines are stamped with their date of manufacture.

""Targets handguns in defiance of the Supreme Court"". 
The Court ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller that the Second Amendment protects the right to have handguns for self-defense, in large part on the basis of the fact handguns are the type of firearm “overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose.” Semi-automatic pistols, which are the most popular handguns today, are designed to use detachable magazines, and the magazines “overwhelmingly chosen” by Americans for self-defense are those that hold more than 10 rounds. Additionally, Feinstein’s list of nearly 1,000 firearms exempted by name (see next paragraph) contains not a single handgun. Sen. Feinstein advocated banning handguns before being elected to the Senate, though she carried a handgun for her own personal protection.

""Contains a larger piece of window dressing than the 1994 ban"". 
Whereas the 1994 ban included a list of approximately 600 rifles and shotguns exempted from the ban by name, the new bill’s list is increased to nearly 1,000 rifles and shotguns. Other than for the 11 detachable-magazine semi-automatic rifles and one other semi-automatic rifle included in the list, however, the list appears to be pointless, because a separate provision of the bill exempts “any firearm that is manually operated by bolt, pump, lever, or slide action.”

""The Department of Justice study"". 
On her website, Feinstein claims that a study for the DOJ found that the 1994 ban resulted in a 6.7 percent decrease in murders. To the contrary, this is what the study said: “At best, the assault weapons ban can have only a limited effect on total gun murders, because the banned weapons and magazines were never involved in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders. Our best estimate is that the ban contributed to a 6.7 percent decrease in total gun murders between 1994 and 1995. . . . However, with only one year of post-ban data, we cannot rule out the possibility that this decrease reflects chance year-to-year variation rather than a true effect of the ban.  Nor can we rule out effects of other features of the 1994 Crime Act or a host of state and local initiatives that took place simultaneously.”

“Assault weapon” numbers and murder trends"". 
From the imposition of Feinstein's “assault weapon” ban (Sept. 13, 1994) through the present, the number of “assault weapons” has risen dramatically. For example, the most common firearm that Feinstein considers an “assault weapon” is the AR-15 rifle, the manufacturing numbers of which can be gleaned from the BATFE’s firearm manufacturer reports, available here. From 1995 through 2011, the number of AR-15s—all models of which Feinstein’s new bill defines as “assault weapons”—rose by over 2.5 million. During the same period, the nation's murder rate fell 48 percent, to a 48-year low. According to the FBI, 8.5 times as many people are murdered with knives, blunt objects and bare hands, as with rifles of any type.

""Traces"": 
Feinstein makes several claims, premised on firearm traces, hoping to convince people that her 1994 ban reduced the (relatively infrequent) use of “assault weapons” in crime. However, traces do not indicate how often any type of gun is used in crime. As the Congressional Research Service and the BATFE have explained, not all firearms that are traced have been used in crime, and not all firearms used in crime are traced. Whether a trace occurs depends on whether a law enforcement agency requests that a trace be conducted. Given that existing “assault weapons” were exempted from the 1994 ban and new “assault weapons” continued to be made while the ban was in effect, any reduction in the percentage of traces accounted for by “assault weapons” during the ban, would be attributable to law enforcement agencies losing interest in tracing the firearms, or law enforcement agencies increasing their requests for traces on other types of firearms, as urged by the BATFE fo
r more than a decade. 
Call You U.S. Senators and Representative: As noted, Fein intends to introduce her bill tomorrow, January 24th. President Obama has said that gun control will be a “central issue” of his final term in office, and he has vowed to move quickly on it. 

 Congress at             REDACTED       to urge them to oppose Sen. Feinstein’s 2013 gun and magazine ban. Our elected representatives in Congress must hear from you if we are going to defeat this gun ban proposal.

Millions of Americans own so-called “assault weapons” and tens of millions own ""large"" magazines, for self-defense, target shooting, and hunting. For more information about the history of the “assault weapon” issue, please visit www.GunBanFacts.com."

you know this is an expensive scope with lifetime warranty. can't find it for less than $1800.
let me know if you have any questions.
Nightforce NXS 3.5-15x50 MRAD Zero Stop MLR C132 Nightforce Optics has enhanced their elevation adjustments in this year’s lineup of high-magnification Nightforce scopes. Now you can get DOUBLE the elevation travel with a SINGLE TURN of the elevation knob. This upgrade gives Nightforce scopes practical performance similar to much more expensive scopes fitted with a single-turn or double-turn elevation systems. For an NXS with 1/4-MOA clicks, this means you can get a full 20 MOA of elevation travel with a single turn of the knob and for metric versions 10 mils. 
This simple enhancement can make a big difference in the field. With most “high-performance” calibers, 20 MOA will get you to 700 yards or beyond whereas a varminter can zero at all normal hunting yardages within the same revolution of the turret. Likewise, a tactical shooter, moving from near to far targets and back again, can stay on the same revolution at most target yardages.
