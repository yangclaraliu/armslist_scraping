Legendary Remington Accuracy
in .50-Caliber
Revolutionary new camming TorchCam™ action — super fast priming, weather-resistant and easy to clean.
The action channels maximum fire from the 209 primer for rapid ignition in the most extreme conditions.
Ambidextrous HammerSpur.
Williams™ fiber-optic sights.
Drilled and tapped for scope mounts.
Aluminum anodized ramrod with jag.
Front and rear swivel studs.
Crossbolt safety.
Removable breech plug.
Bullet-guiding muzzle.
Optimized for use with Remington Kleenbore 209 Muzzleloading Primers.
Magnum power, easy cleaning and legendary Remington accuracy in a hot new design that defines reliable. Our innovative TorchCam™ action rotates from the fixed breech for fast priming and locks your 209 primer in a vault of weather resistance. It delivers rapid, super-hot ignition in the most extreme conditions. And to clean, simply unscrew the breech plug, swab the barrel and you’re finished.
We’ve stretched the limits of muzzleloader performance. With a full 28"" of powder-burning steel, the Genesis generates maximum velocity from magnum 150-grain charges. And you get the swift-handling characteristics of a much shorter gun – the ultra-compact design of the TorchCam™ action keeps overall length and weight to a minimum. The barrel’s 1-in-28"" twist provides optimum stability for sabots and other modern muzzleloading projectiles.
Our TorchCam™ action was designed with safety in mind. The over-travel hammer never comes in contact with the firing pin unless the gun is fully cocked and the trigger is pulled. A crossbolt safety adds extra assurance. Our ambidextrous HammerSpur offers right- and left-handed shooters a rigid grip through cocking and hammer letdown without scope interference."

Great opportunity if you have a LCP but the recoil of the .380 is too much in that small package. I have shot both side by side and the recoil is much more manageable on the P32 than the LCP. I originally purchased this gun for my GF but she prefers her revolver so I have been using it as a back up gun, but I would prefer to carry a .380 since I am not too sensitive to the recoil. The factory sights were white on the gun but I found they would blend together when shooting, so I painted the front sight orange and the rear sight green which allows for a more consistent and repeatable sight picture and increased accuracy.

I have the original factory KelTec soft pouch, and manual. The gun and factory magazine and 3 additional factory magazines that cost $20 each. Also including 2 50rd boxes of 73gr FMJ ammo and a 20rd box of Federal Hydrashok hollow point ammo. Will trade everything straight across for a Ruger LCP with 1 mag. Will add cash if you have more than 2 mags. Will also consider trading for a Ruger LC9. Not interested in anything else in trade. Cash price $280 for everything which is a steal because I have $380 invested with the ammunition I am including."

It has the nice novak sights and i paid a gunsmith 65 bucks to make the sights glow in the dark. I have 44 rounds of ammo left. This is a very nice shooting gun. The guys at the range say that super 38 is as powerful as a 357 magnum and it is a very accurate round. I free handed shot a one foot by one foot square target at 50 feet, thats as far out as the target will go at my gun range. Anyway i didnt get the bullseye but all 6 shots were on the paper a little bigger than the size of an adult head at 50 feet so its a very accurate pistol. Oh the glowing sight need  to be in the light about 5 minutes but will glow about 4 hours before cant see them anymore.

Sale Price $100

Model 6280
Level II Retention Duty Holster, Mid-Ride

The Safariland Model 6280 holster is the base model of Self Locking System (SLS™) series of holsters. It includes a unique rotating hood design. This holster also features a Universal Belt Loop that mounts on a 2"" or 2.25"" Duty Belt. With no snap, the Safariland 6280 holster’s SLS™ design allows for a smoother single-motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways. The hood can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. It is also far less likely to release accidentally than conventional thumb break snaps. The 6280 holster features a tensioning device, which, when firmly adjusted becomes a Level III Retention™ holster.

It features a 24"" barrel with iron sights and a pistol grip stock with checkered steel buttplate. Overall very good condition with some wear from use. The left side of the receiver has been drilled and tapped for a side-mount scope and the rifle currently has a Lyman receiver sight installed. The original blue finish rates about 90-92% overall with a few small rust spots on the sides of the receiver, one ding along the right upper edge of the receiver, a ding at the right outer edge of the muzzle, and a buggered forend cap screw. The stocks are in generally good condition. There is a short/tight crack to the rear of the frame on the left side and the wood shows some dents and dings including some scratches to the left side of the butt. The mechanics are in good working order and the bore is excellent. According to the serial number, this rifle was manufactured in 1955. A great nostalgic hunter just as is, or a good starting point for a project!

I am looking for a private individual who is willing to let me use their land for plinking with my rifles and pistols once or twice a month with my girlfriend.  I am not into hunting.  I do it mostly to blow off steam from the work week and to have fun. 

I am interested since I just moved here from South Carolina where I had plenty of room to shoot and I don't want to give up the hobby just because I got a job in the city.  If you are interested in having me out let me know.  We can work out some kind of payment then.

Comes complete with Yugo cleaning kit, 30rd Yugo mag, Original Yugo short muzzle break (for SBR), sling, Yugo M92 original trigger pack, case and accessories carry pouch. These are very rare rifles. Krinkov Rifles are a factory short barreled AK47 with the short stroke system (10.5in barrel). They were designed and used by the Russian Speznaz for CQB. The extendend ""hollow"" muzzle brake has been put on with a tac-weld to make it legal length (16.25in).
     They are typically bought to SBR them as the extended muzzle break can be removed to install the short muzzle break after getting you SBR tax stamp. It was built on a proper Krinkov No-Dak Spuds underfolder lower receiver. 
     This is a brand new never fired Rifle still in the case! This is not a used parts de-milled kit..it is a brand new from the Yugo factory virgin rifle. 
     I can send more pictures upon request. You must be legal to own! 
     Typically an SBR version of this weapon sells for $2000 - $2500 + you still have to buy the $200 tax stamp.....this is the faster route and you can get the Tax Stamp at your leisure! I have two of these great firearms and am looking for a trade only at this time. Thanks for looking.

The gun ALSO comes with the Insight M6X tactical laser/light combo which mounts under the gun. I still have the original case for the light and the light comes with extra batteries and an extra bulb. This gun ALSO comes with a leg holster. I will say this though, the leg holster was not made for this pistol, though it does work, it doesn't work as good as it should. But I'm sure a few tweaks would make it fit perfectly, I was just too lazy to actually do it. I'm asking $775 for everything. I believe I have shot this gun 4 times with each time putting about 50 rounds through it. This is literally a new gun and has been kept up. The gun itself new is $569 and the light itself is $320. Together with tax you are easily looking at $900+. I'm asking $775 for EVERYTHING. This is the best I can do and if you do your research, you'll know this is a great deal.

If your interested, I'm also willing to just sell the light. Like I said, it's an Insight M6X Laser/Light combo. I'd be willing to sell that for $275. It's in perfect condition with the box, extra light and extra batteries that come with it."

Light, nimble, but ruggedly built, the M2 12-gauge shotgun are built around the ultra-reliable Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism. The Inertia Driven® system allows the M2 to digest nearly any 12 gauge cartridge, from 2-3/4"" target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums.
Benelli engineers have also adapted the ComforTech® recoil system for the M2. This revolutionary system reduces felt recoil by up to 48% and cuts muzzle climb by 15%. When combined, this puts the shooter back on target up to 69% faster than with any other comparable semi-automatic shotgun. The M2 is not only faster, but with the new ComforTech® system, it may be the most comfortable shotgun you will ever shoot."

I've made numerous mods to the rifle since the date of purchase. See below for the list.


SPECIFICATIONS:
 Action :Semi-Automatic
 Caliber :5.56/2.23 Winchester
 Barrel Length : UPGRADED 16"" Free Floating
 Capacity :30+1
 Trigger : UPGRADED Tactical trigger & hammer
 Safety :Lever
 Stock :UPGRADED Tactical 6 position adjustable stock
 Rail: UPGRADED LaRue Free Floating Picatinny Rail
 Sight: UPGRADED LaRue Adjustable BUIS
 Finish :Black

 * Front & Rear sling mounts
 * Upgraded grip
 * 6 - 30rd military mags
 * Magpul V2 Sling

Due to the fact that it is a free floating barrel coupled with good ammunition, this is an extremely accurate rifle and will get the job done! Keep in mind the modification to make this a free floating barrel coupled with the LaRue rail and sight costs around $400 in itself, the sights and all the other stuff aside. Had about 500 rds through it so far so it's been broken in. 

I am looking to get $950 for the gun OBO but please be reasonable.

Gun cycles perfectly no issues since Ive used it. I shot the gun roughly 40 times to sight in the scope thats on it in the picture then the elevation turret fell off the scope....so, I will be including a 10-40x50 Barska varmint scope with this rifle rather than the scope that is pictured.
AR fires and due to the weight is almost right on target for the follow up shots as well.

Make me an offer, not in a hurry to get rid of the gun so no low offers.
Only reason I am selling it is because I just got a really nice drum shell kit in another trade so I need to get the cash for hardware and cymbals...told myself I wouldn't sell this gun, guess I was wrong.

It is a beautiful rifle that looks nearly factory new.  I have not even fired this rifle.  There is still cosmoline on the bolt.  See pictures for condition and let me know any questions.  Local sale Only.
The M48 Mauser is a post World War II Yugoslavian version of the Belgian Fabrique Nationale designed Mauser Model 1924 short rifle which was produced under contract by the ""Kingdom of Yugoslavia"" beginning in 1928 and ending with the Nazi occupation in 1941. After World War II, the Yugoslavs took this design and incorporated modifications based upon Germany's Mauser Karabiner 98k. Although similar in general appearance to that of the German rifle, many of the parts of these two rifles are not interchangeable, especially the bolt and related action parts. The main difference between the M48 and the K98k is that the M48 uses an intermediate-length receiver. They are usually easily identified by the top handguard, which extends behind the rear sight and ends just in front of the receiver ring, although this feature exists on other models as well."

The condition is 99%. Shiny black like NEW.
I would have to say its had less tha 100 rounds through it cause the barrel is nice and shiny inside and the rifling grooves are still nice and deep.
When it comes to old collectables this is the nicest TP22 I've seen on the net so far.

You can check gunbroker, gunsamerica, backpage, and here in all the states. Every 1 looks beat to crap and the frame is wore to bare metal and they are asking $200-250.

Paid $650 and has less than 500 rounds through it. There is even a video showing how well this pistol works. 1,250 rounds, non-stop firing, zero jams. My loss, your gain. Wanted $495 cash (firm) and I am very open to trades. Has to be 9mm or .308 rifles so let's see what you got.

About Swiss Army Knives

In 1884, Swiss cutler Karl Elsener set up shop in Ibach-Schwyz, installing a waterwheel in Tobelbach Brook to run his grinding and polishing machines. Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and ""inox,"" or stainless steel. Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The forerunner of that name dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor or versatility.

In 1897, when Karl Elsener created the Victorinox, Original Swiss Army Knife, he could never have guessed how it would become a worldwide icon for function and durability, and the symbol for Swiss ingenuity. This unique ingenuity - which has inspired all of Victorinox Swiss Army products - comes from a dedication to listening, hearing and evolving designs to reflect the multi-faceted lives and values of our consumers. The SwissChamp pocket knife is the ultimate in functionality and utility. Incredible that this product features 80 functions and can actually fit into a pocket. The SwissChamp can do it."

 I have been the only person to shoot this - it has never been dropped, mishandled or left out to the elements. Cleaned and oiled after every use.

I sent the trigger out to Bill Springfield for one of his trigger jobs. It is nice and repeatable now. It also has a quad rail installed.

I have 6 mags that come with it - Two 10 rounders(These are a must have for bench shooting) and Four 30 rounders. Two of the 30 rounders haven't even been used yet. I have the original manuals and the barrel wrench for it.

I am listing this to fund other projects. The mags and the trigger job are worth half of my asking price. Please do the shopping and see that this is a DEAL. This rifle goes for $550+tax new with one magazine. The mags go for $30 each.  I am asking for $600 OBO.

Face to face sale - I don't want to ship this. I may be interested in a trade for a glock 9mm or a keltec sub2000 in 9mm using glock style mags.

The Fieldcraft Knife was designed by The Brothers of Bushcraft, a coalition of men across North America focusing on sharing wilderness living skills of all categories. The Fieldcraft Knife is the culmination of their knowledge, combining experiences from; the broad and humid rain forests, the arid and scorpion-littered deserts, and the frigid northern lands that span the Americas. 

The knife is ten inches long in total, with a blade length of four and a half inches. This makes a compact, but extremely serviceable knife. The cutting edge is a modified Scandinavian Grind, which is very effective for carving, skinning and other general woods work. With a rockwell hardness of 56-58, the ease of sharpening is astounding. That is if you ever need to sharpen the blade. As the hardness and edge geometry work beautifully together to make a long lasting edge. 

The handle is one of the most ergonomic ones on the market, sporting several useful additions. The bow drill divot on the handle is frictionless and makes starting those primitive fires almost effortless. The ""Thumb Scallops"", formed on the hilt of the handle offer more comfort and control when using specialized carving and skinning grips. The pommel of the blade is simply the tang of the knife exposed enough to allow impact from a baton to not effect the handle (though the micarta is definitely tough enough to take such abuse). 

On the exposed pommel, you will find a scraper specially designed by one of The Brothers of Bushcraft, for striking Ferro rods in a safe and efficient manner. The sheath is a strong, durable Kydex, with a steel belt clip. This arrangement allows a safe, secure and comfortable carry on the belt, pack strap, or even around the neck. With a built in Ferro-rod attachment point, the sheath now doubles as a minimalist survival kit.

As slickly designed as it is ingenious, the CardSharp 2 (the second iteration) is a CREDIT CARD sized safety knife with a razor sharp, 2.6"" blade that can be easily carried in one's wallet. From Sinclair's website:

""A new improved superlight and supersharp utility knife, size of a credit card. Updated features include stiffer, polypropylene body (living hinges guaranteed for life) and unique safety lock (cannot open in pocket or drawer and child proof). Just three ingenious folding operations metamorphosise the card into an elegant pocket utility tool. Slimmer and lighter than an ordinary knife.

The extra long stainless steel surgical blade ensures longer lasting rust free sharpness. The superlight polypropylene body includes a built-in protective sheath that helps prevent injury or blunting. CardSharp2 is an ingenious conversation piece. A sharp idea that slips safely inside your wallet or kit bag.""


LIGHTWEIGHT - 13 grams (regular Stanley type utility knife weighs around 150 grams, Leatherman same sized blade knife weighs around 85 grams, smallest Victorinox Swiss Army penknife weighs around 23 grams).

ULTRA THIN - 2.2 mm thick (traditional Stanley utility knife body thickness is around 25 mm).

RAZOR SHARP - Surgical blade technology with extra long 65mm cutting edge ensures longer lasting sharpness (Stanley utility knife blade edge is only 25mm long). Blade made from high quality rust free stainless steel. Independent testing laboratory; CATRA awarded Cardsharp penknife; VERY GOOD status for sharpness (ICP mm) and life (TCC mm). Blade color choice: Teflon Black or Natural Brushed Stainless Steel.

SAFETY - Blade edge is protected when stored in wallet, drawer, or kit bag which avoids accidents and blunting (blunting often caused by rubbing against other knives or tools). Integral blade 'sheath' cannot be lost. Protective hilt appears when opened. When docked in closed position, design prevents injury. Cannot fold accidentally (as some folding pocket knives). Blade is locked solidly in open, cutting mode with no blade tremor allowing accurate precision cutting.

WATERPROOF - Machine washable with no hinged parts to rust up like ordinary folding pocket knives.

ECO FRIENDLY - Lightness and flatness reduces storage and shipping costs including carbon footprint. Simple two part construction with automated assembly saves manufacturing waste.

PERMUTABILITY - Highly suitable for customization by pad printing or invisible label (printed 1-4 color lithographic) and/or custom laser engraving blade - please email us if you have a promotion inquiry).

PACKAGING - Various options available including slimline card eco-pack for gift/mail order and harder sell retail design with euro hook.

LEGAL - Blade is under 3"" (76 mm) and is visible when closed so easily identifiable as a knife (optional clear body versions show blade from both sides - P.O.A). Note: legal restrictions vary internationally.


TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:

- Product size: 85.6 x 54 x 2.2 mm (size of credit card)

As a knife enthusiast, you may be ""in the know"" about Sanrenmu. For those of you who are not, let me explain. 

Sanrenmu Knives Co. LTD was founded back in December of 1998. This little known knife manufacturer is credited with making some very high quality, well designed yet affordable folder knives especially suited for every day carry purposes. In fact if you have any contacts within the knife/cutlery trade you will find out that Sanrenmu's other activities include manufacturing knives for numerous western brands such as Benchmande and Spyderco. So believe me when I say you're getting a lot for your money with Sanrenmu.

The knives sold under the Sanrenmu brand can go head to head with many other brands that cost two to three times more. That's what make these great EDC knives such an amazing find!

The 710 model is probably the most recognized of Sanrenmu's EDC lineup. Known as the ""poor man's Sebenza"", the SRM 710's quality and construction is on par with knives that cost multiples of this sleek EDC'er. A favorite of many Sanrenmu fanatics. 

If you're looking for a fantastic, high quality, every day pocket knife without the ridiculous price tag, look no further than Sanrenmu...you're ""in the know"" now.
