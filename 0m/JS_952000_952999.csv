For sell is a Hi point C9 in great shape has around 2000 rounds through it. The gun has had a trigger job and has a 3lb pull vs the stock 9lb pull. I think the stock grips are slippery so I put grip tape on the grips and gun but if that's not your thing is comes right off. Also comes with a pair of custom cherry grips that are showing some wear but still work great.

It has full tapco furniture with folding stock, tapco trigger, front rails, and a tri-rail on the rear cover for mounting. Gun also has the side mount on the receiver if you wanna go that route.  I do have the wood furniture that came with the gun, and I also have the original dust cover as well in case you prefer the side mount (the iron sights are still fully usable with the picatinny rail on) Gun does come with the tac light and the red dot that is shown in the picture as well as three 30 round magazines..
  If the ad is up then the gun is still available, so there is no reason to e-mail me asking if it still available. I am asking a reasonable price for everything (going for $1500 stock on average right now) so please do have the same respect and do not waste my time, ONLY SERIOUS OFFERS. I would love to keep this gun but I need some cash for projects I am working on so I am really not interested in trades right now unless it is a motorcycle. Thanks.

All major metal components on the USP are corrosion-resistant. Outside metal surfaces are protected by H&K’s proprietary “hostile environment” nitride finish. Internal metal parts are coated with a Dow Corning anti-corrosion chemical to reduce friction and wear.

The gunmaker tested the MK23′s recoil system with over 30k rounds of +P ammunition followed by 6k high pressure proof rounds. After disassembling the gun the Germans found no damage or excessive wear to any of the components.

And then they did some more tests . . .

The ballistic boffins froze the USP to −42 °C (−43.5 °F), fired it and then frozen it again. They heated it to 67 °C (152.6 °F) and fired it. They cycled between these extremes several times. They subjected USP to standard NATO mud and rain abuse. They immersed it in water and sprayed it with sea water. They dropped it from six feet, hammer first, onto a steel-backed concrete slab.

H&K employees deliberately lodged a bullet in the barrel and then sent another one down the pipe. The second bullet cleared the obstruction producing only a minor bulge in the barrel. They loaded a full magazine and then fired the gun again with the bulging barrel. The resulting group measured less than 4 inches of deviation at 25 meters – a standard that some new guns would be lucky to hold.

In short, Heckler & Koch , The selected gun by the US Seal Teams."

 This may be your last chance. I was in a local firearms retailer this week. There backlog of AR orders is 38. Yes 38 and that was 1 out of 5 or 6 local stores. So imagine how many are on backorder across this great country? They said before the last 2 months they were receiving and selling 10 or so AR style rifles per week and now they are only receiving 1-2 per week, if any. So getting on a backorder list is far from a guarantee as they could be BANNED before you would receive one."

Based on a long lineage of straight pull bolt action rifles, beginning with the Schmidt-Rubin Model 1889. Rubin designed the bullet that was combined with Schmidt's straight pull bolt rifle. 

A very accurate, detachable magazine fed rifle with a very unique straight pull bolt that allowed the soldier to quickly chamber rounds by pulling straight back on the bolt and then slamming it forward. Very revolutionary engineering in a battle rifle for the late 1800's. Because of the straight pull bolt technology the Swiss soldier did not have to raise up (exposing themselves to enemy fire) and chamber a round, like a standard turn-bolt rifle. 
this rifle is the most accurate surplus rifle i have shot.
 it is in excellent shape, it has the typical scratches and dings in the stock you see in these rifles.
 the bluing is in excellent shape also.
 bore is mirror and crown is excellent.
 if you want one of the most accurate surplus rifles there is,the swiss engineering of these rifles are amazing.

Product Description 

The Punisher Grip include pre-cut panel additions with adhesive backing that attach to the frame and slide for a superior grip in the most extreme weather conditions imaginable without increasing bulk for everyday/everywhere on/off duty carry. Easy to install. Just peel and adhere and just as easily replaced or removed. Extremely durable and resistant to most solvents and oils. Especially developed for the new generation of polymer frame pistols. The trend in modern handgun design incorporates a polymer frame that is lightweight, and tends to get slippery when wet or sweaty, severely affecting your grip and accuracy. The Punisher grips are specially designed panel additions to provide you with a positive grip surface improving your grip in wet, dry, hot or cold environments. Fits Glock models G26,27,28,33, and 39"

Comes with 50 rounds of .38 S&W 148gr. For 100 years old this is a beautiful gun and a great addition to anyone's collection.  Asking $400 OBO. Shoot me an offer the worst I can say is no.   Buyer must be at least 21 and have a valid OH drivers license."

Notes:  I built this rifle to get as close as reasonably possible to the military spec for the M16A4.  The following will detail a few of the features of this rifle.

Barrel:  The barrel is a 20"" government profile barrel, chrome-lined with a 1:7 twist rate per military specs.  The barrel is made out of 4150 CMV steel which again is the same barrel steel that the military M16A4 uses.  The barrel has the HPT/MP markings which means that it was proof tested.

Bolt Carrier Group:  Again this rifle uses a M16 BCG opposed to an AR15 group.  Again the BCG is made out of the military spec steel which is Carpenter 158 steel.

The picture of this rifle has the detachable carry handle and would come with your choice of the carry handle or magpul back up sight (MBUS)."

It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but Tapco has made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, they made the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, they redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, they made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But they didn't just stop on improving the spring, they also totally revamped the follower.

Tapco has kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won't be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag.

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

The shotgun has 2 barrels; They are easily removed and swapped with a thumbscrew. It's called a 500A combo, it has all wood furniture that is in good shape, comes with a 28"" Field barrel and a 24"" Fully-Rifled Slugster® Barrel with Adjustable Rifle Sights.
So one barrel is for shot and the other barrel is rifled inside and designed for accurate shooting of slugs.
The gun looks pretty good, but as you get closer you see the fading of the bluing. I was planning on re-bluing the metal. It can be done at home, it's called cold bluing and it's done with liquid that reacts with the metal.
Anyway, it functions flawlessly. If you need a shotgun for near 200.00, I can give you this one for 225.00 with the 2 barrels. It needs nothing and works perfect. It's heavy, it's all metal with no plastic and is ready to hunt.  Will trade for a good .22 or a larger caliber rifle
Thanks."

The shotgun has 2 barrels; They are easily removed and swapped with a thumbscrew. It's called a 500A combo, it has all wood furniture that is in good shape, comes with a 28"" Field barrel and a 24"" Fully-Rifled Slugster® Barrel with Adjustable Rifle Sights.
So one barrel is for shot and the other barrel is rifled inside and designed for accurate shooting of slugs.
The gun looks pretty good, but as you get closer you see the fading of the bluing. I was planning on re-bluing the metal. It can be done at home, it's called cold bluing and it's done with liquid that reacts with the metal.
Anyway, it functions flawlessly. If you need a shotgun for near 200.00, I can give you this one for 225.00 with the 2 barrels. It needs nothing and works perfect. It's heavy, it's all metal with no plastic and is ready to hunt.  Will trade for a good .22 or a larger caliber rifle

When your Kalashnikov is thirsting for a magazine that can handle a beating, no questions asked, the INTRAFUSE® 30rd AK Magazine is the only logical choice. Not to mention that this magazine counts as 3 U.S. 922r compliant parts.

This is not a bone stock, ragged out, or cheap AR-15. It is a full Spikes rig with all necessary options and has been fully sighted in. I just have two and while I do not need to sell, thought I would see what is out there. Needless to say the rifle alone cost $1200, the scope $400, the flip-up $100, and all the added accessories another $200. However, as we all know Spikes is about 1 year behind on orders and similar rigs are going for $2000 to $2500. I am NOT looking to rip anyone off, I would just like to add some new toys to my arsenal and do not need so many AR's.

I really don't need the money and will consider a full or partial trade. A full trade would obviously require several guns on your part. I am willing to trade current value for current value. NO BS. Cash sale is acceptable, yet I am not going to accept a very low offer.

Email me and I will consider what you have. Face-to-face and full trade and sale certificate required. 

Just look around here, on other sights and at dealers. Stripped Spikes are going for $1500 with nothing included. People are requesting over $1200 for bare DPMS and Bushmasters are between $2000 and $4000. Let’s be honest, this is a really fair deal."

I WILL NOT budge on the price. This rifle was hard to find all the parts and accessories for and I had to pay more than normal retail price for many things due to supply and demand. I am not in a hurry to sell this gun, at first I wasn't even going to. I need the money for more important issues however. The gun will remain in brand new condition because I don't plan on shooting it for a while unless I decide to keep the gun in which case I will remove this listing. No trades, no shipping, local face to face meetings and cash only. Thank you for your time"

The shotgun has 2 barrels; They are easily removed and swapped with a thumbscrew. It's called a 500A combo, it has all wood furniture that is in good shape, comes with a 28"" Field barrel and a 24"" Fully-Rifled Slugster® Barrel with Adjustable Rifle Sights.
So one barrel is for shot and the other barrel is rifled inside and designed for accurate shooting of slugs.
The gun looks pretty good, but as you get closer you see the fading of the bluing. I was planning on re-bluing the metal. It can be done at home, it's called cold bluing and it's done with liquid that reacts with the metal.
Anyway, it functions flawlessly. If you need a shotgun for near 200.00, I can give you this one for 225.00 with the 2 barrels. It needs nothing and works perfect. It's heavy, it's all metal with no plastic and is ready to hunt.  Will trade for a good .22 or a larger caliber rifle

It has had the receiver drilled and tapped (2 small holes on side) and a Williams peep sight installed giving it an extra foot of sight radius. I've had it out to the range numerous times, and its a bell ringer at 100yds. Action is smoother than butter!

The shotgun has 2 barrels; They are easily removed and swapped with a thumbscrew. It's called a 500A combo, it has all wood furniture that is in good shape, comes with a 28"" Field barrel and a 24"" Fully-Rifled Slugster® Barrel with Adjustable Rifle Sights.
So one barrel is for shot and the other barrel is rifled inside and designed for accurate shooting of slugs.
The gun looks pretty good, but as you get closer you see the fading of the bluing. I was planning on re-bluing the metal. It can be done at home, it's called cold bluing and it's done with liquid that reacts with the metal.
Anyway, it functions flawlessly. If you need a shotgun for near 200.00, I can give you this one for 225.00 with the 2 barrels. It needs nothing and works perfect. It's heavy, it's all metal with no plastic and is ready to hunt.  Will trade for a good .22 or a larger caliber rifle
Thanks."
