FS: Like new 580 series Mini-14 SS Ranch w/extras 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just picked up another Spike's Tactical Mid-length so something needs to go. I've got a 580 series Stainless Ranch Rifle that has the heavy, tapered barrel. Comes with three 20 round Ruger factory mags, Ruger scope rings, a stainless Accustrut, QD sling swivels and Wilson .45 ACP front and rear shock buffers.
At the first range session I was getting shot stringing with a warm barrel. I added the Accustrut and it ended the stringing. It shoots 1"" 50 yard groups with cheap Fiocchi 55 gr. FMJ and iron sights. It has had under 100 rounds through it. Never a malfunction of any kind.  I bought for a truck gun and after I got it dialed in it has sat.  I've got a cheap 870 I can throw in the truck and never use, LOL 
Here's what I have in it:
Rifle $749.99
Two extra 20 round factory mags @ $37.95= $75.90
QD 1 1/4"" swivels $15
Tax $60.54
Accustrut $111.00 

Total $1,012.73

Reduced to $700 cash (firm). Any lower and I'll just keep it.    Not interested is trades

Only asking $400!

New Retail MSRP: $565.

If you're in the market for a quality conceal carry in a 9mm caliber then this is the gun for you. It is one of the smallest/lightest/thinest 9mm semi-auto's currently manufactured.

ABOUT THE GUN:
When I say ""Practically Brand New"", I mean it. This guy has only been owned for a month.

In fact, this model was just released in March and when I picked it up a month ago I had to do it Special Order cause I couldn't find one anywhere in the greater Denver area. 
I've only run 200 rounds thru it so can thank me for saving you $60 and your time getting it past the recommended Kahr break in period.

I have everything that came with the purchase (case, manual, trigger lock) in mint condition. No blemishes, marks, defects. In perfect condition and thoroughly maintained.

For those familiar with the Kahr line, the CM9 is virtually identical to the PM9 - sans a 2nd clip, polygonal barrel (CM uses a standard rifled barrel) and the marking/machining on the slide is a little different.

PICTURES:
I'm posting this with my IPad so I'm unable to load pics right now. I will attempt to load them later on a PC, however in the interim if interested PM me and I will e-mail them to you directly.

FYI:
The only reason I'm willing to part with this 1 month old sub-compact ""mousegun"" is because I've come to realize I'm a Glock & Springfield Man.

TRADE OPTIONS:
I'm open to trades for any of the following Glock models: G26, G22, G23 or G27, Springfield XD 9mm or .40 models (preferably compact or subcompact) or any quality 1911.

I can throw in a brand new Uncle Mikes subcompact holster (I just bought for this gun), some new 9mm ammo and/or some cash to even out the deal - based on the condition/make of your trade.

FINAL WORD: I'm in absolutely no hurry to part with this guy, so low balling or shady deals will get no response. Looking for a fair trade or cash offer only.

Taurus 1911 AL .45acp in very good condition.  This is an aluminum frame, so it is much lighter the standard 1911's. It is incredibly accurate. It has 7 mags (3 Wilson Combat mags, 2 Taurus mags, 1 Kimpro mag and a no name mag).  All of the mags hold 8 rds. each. Read the reviews on this gun. You'll be surprised...it is a great firearm.  Do some research and you will see that this 1911 has a lot of upgrades that come stock.

Comes with the Taurus lifetime (of the firearm) warranty.

Sooooo.....

I have a Norinco SKS in a Butler Creek synthetic monte carlo style stock.  It's pretty well stock with the 10 rd magazine.  There is no bayonet on it either.  All numbers match, except for the stock for obvious reasons.  I bought it thinking I would make it a project gun but have since lost interest in it.  Included with the gun are approximately 175 rds ammunition and a hard gun case (nothing fancy either).

My asking price is $300 for everything, but I am open to (NO LOW BALL) offers as well.  Actually, I'd really prefer trades.  I'd like .308 or 6.5x55 Swedish ammunition, reloading supplies for either of the two calibers listed,  maybe an AR lower receiver and cash, collapsing or folding stock set for a Remington 870... gun stuff, y'know?

It is from a run of 500 Colt made of the first factory Lightweight Stainless Commanders and part of their new-at the time- 'Enhanced' models. It came with a stainless steel Combat Commander slide and the 'teflon' grey frame. It had the awful duck bill grip safety and plastic trigger and MSH. It had the black rubber grips w/ Colt medallions and a cheesy 'wrap around' strip that I cut off. Without it they are super nice grips. It came with 2 Chip McCormick Shooting Star 8 round mags and I bought 1 more for it. I put 300 rounds through it and sent it to Don Williams at The Action Works. I had the 'reliability package' done, and He put in a Videcki trigger, set it to 4.5 pounds, installed an S&A beavertail and wedge MSH, and an Ed Brown thumb safety and hammer. Cost for the work in '96 was $335. When Duracoat came out I had the frame done in Blackhawk tan. I since have only put another 100-150 rounds through it for a total of >450 rounds. It wears the stock sights still. It has spent most of its life in my safe as my intentions were this would be my everyday carry when I retired from the PD. The very little I did carry it, it wore an Andrews McDaniels IWB holster. Since this is the only holster it has ever known, I'm including it in the sale as well as the matching double mag holder. It also comes with the smaller belt loop attachment (not shown) This is a $165 combo.
Priorities and needs have changed, so its for sale.

Cavalry Arms decided they would overcome any concern about a weak spot where the stock would mount onto a lower by simply molding the lower and the stock together for an extremely strong combination that is only a couple of inches longer than a collapsible stock in its shortest setting (which is not good for shooting from, so you just have to waste time extending it at least one position or you may as well be firing from the hip, IMHO).  It is also an extremely stable and durable lower/stock combination, providing more stability and therefor better accuracy than the collapsible stocks that tend to wiggle around.

The upper has the ""Full Profile"" barrel which doesn't have that weak spot (for the M-203 that you or I will never own or use) milled into it.  This is my personal favorite barrel, and it is a lot harder to find than it should be (everyone, and I mean EVERYONE is using the M-4 Profile barrel because they are a dime a dozen, literally). 

It comes with the Piccatinny Rail Adapter on top so that you can mount any optic that you would like on it.  I have ordered an A1 rear sight kit so that I can install it and you will be able to use either iron sights or mount an optic.

Also, it has a Dark Earth MagPul MOE handguard on it.  The handguard has two MagPul mini-Picatinny rails with Dark Earth covers on them.  These can be used to mount anything from a laser to a flashlight to the front of your weapon.  

The vertical fore-grip is a UTG-Leapers.  It has slots on the side for the addition of pressure switches, and the removable compartment on the bottom has room for 2 AA or 3 lithium batteries (as spares for whatever you need them for, flashlight, optic, whatever...). 

It comes with a Dark Earth MagPul polymer magazine.  This magazine comes with a dust cover that snaps on the top and keeps out dirt and other debris until you need to use it.  When the cover is not covering the top of the magazine, it can be snapped on the bottom so that it doesn't get lost.  

Finally, it comes with a black nylon G.I. sling with metal hardware.

For only $650, this is an very nice and extremely capable weapon.  If you have any questions, please let me know!"

Wood is about 85%, metal is much better.  2 different gunsmiths looked at it, both put it at 90+%.

The stock is a GI stock, it just may be an Arsenal stock, it doesn't appear to be the original one.

One original mag matches serial #, other two are parkerized, and all work perfectly. Also have original cleaning rod, and a couple of manuals. All the work common to these guns has been done: Have done some polishing to smooth out the trademark gritty trigger; replaced the recoil spring to ease the recoil a bit; and have swapped the hammer spring to make the trigger pull lighter. Also including the Wolffe Gunsprings calibration packs. These are three recoil springs and three hammer springs of different strengths so you can adjust the pistol to your liking and your ammunition. I have one of each installed and am including the original springs as well. They are extremely easy to change even if you're not mechanically inclined. It works beautifully, though, so there should be no reason to change any of them. Also includes three replacement firing pin springs (they came with the recoil spring pack).

Fires the 9mm Makarov round, also called 9X18 mm. I buy mine from ammunitionstore.com, which is located right in North Canton, for about the same price as 9mm Luger.

Read the description of this Hungarian Walther clone on wikipedia here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FEG_PA-63

Gun seemed to be in unissued condition when I got it, and I have fired about 200 rounds through it. It works perfectly and is far more accurate than I am and the trigger is very smooth, has a crisp break and a short reset. Bore is perfect. The importer mark is clean, and is on the slide and not the weird ""dot text"" under the muzzle you see in a lot of pictures of these online.

I'm selling it because it doesn't fit my hand very well. My ""firing range buddies"" seem to have no problems with it though. It is a great gun for CCW. Very accurate and reliable, and holsters are easy to find. Also, the aluminum alloy frame makes it very lightweight.

I would like $265 for everything, or trade for a CZ-82 with 2 or more magazines.

I don't believe that this has been fired. The bores are perfect and show no sign of having had shells inserted. The breech face is clean and again no marks indicating firing. And, the firing pins, where the hammers would fall, are still perfect and show no signs of being hit by the hammers. Of course, it has the original Rossi butt plate, which also is in new condition. The action on this Rossi has got to be one of the smoothest I've ever seen. It opens nicely, and closes very smoothly.

These Rossi 20 gauge coach guns are true 20 gauge guns - not just 20 gauge barrels on a 12 gauge action. 

A really nice example of a Rossi, and as you probably know, these are  difficult to find since they are no longer manufactured. Rossis hammered coach guns are preferred over others because they are solid, reliable, and don't have any extra safties like the more modern coach guns.

Price is $500.00, plus $30 shipping and insurance.

Up for sale is a ""NEW"" Remington 700 Sendaro in Stainless with only 15 rounds put through it, cleaned after each round. Caliber is 22-250. 1st owner. Rifle only, glass and bi-pod not included. Asking $725.00 OBO. Make me a solid offer. No low ball-ers unless I am being unreasonable with my price. I have all original paperwork that the rifle came with. 

Trigger was worked down by Remington's custom shop. 

Looking for a newer Thompson Pro Hunter stainless black powder with the recoil stock. 

Includes all of Remington paperwork that came with the rifle. As rifle sits in pictures with Harris bi-pod and Leupold Vari-x III, 6.5-20 40 MM obj. and sunshade, $1,200.

Must have valid FOID card and drivers license at sale. 

Features include:

Its stock is Kevlar with a rough texture, no checkering, and a pattern of gray swirls throughout. Length of pull is 133/8 inches; drop at comb is 5/8 inches; and drop at the heel is 5/8 inches. The butt pad is 1/4-inch-thick rubber with a 1/4-inch black-plastic spacer. The forearm has a slight radius and measures 1.16 inches halfway between the floor plate and the end. Detachable sling swivels are supplied.

The stock features a molded-in aluminum frame that reinforces the stock from pistol grip to the forend. This also is machined to provide a precision bedding platform for the receiver. The barrel is floated free from the stock.

The action and jeweled barrel are stainless steel, with the fluted barrel measuring 26 inches. It measures 0.82 inches behind the muzzle, 1.25 inches where it meets the action, and 0.99 inches at the halfway point. There are six flutes milled in the barrel to aid in heat dissipation. 

The Remington 700 still has one of the best factory triggers available. Not so much because they are good out of the box—they are not—but because it is adjustable by someone who knows what he is doing. A good gunsmith can usually adjust the trigger to 2 pounds with little trouble. This trigger was worked on at Remington after purchase. I think it was set at 2.1 lbs. of pull. 

The action is the standard 700 with a two-lug locking system. The rifle features a drop-plate magazine. 

Great rifle. New VS SF II is $1400.00 and includes an HS stock."

Its like buying this at a dealer but....not.

There are requirements of buying this. You must provide a valid drivers license. There will be a typed contract for buyers and sellers eyes only. There will be the Names of the both parties, Gun Make, Model, and serial number, dates, and signitures of both parties. This is just in case something illegal was to happen with this weapon once it leaves my hands. I will not be held responsible. This is a must. No exceptions.

Since I have over $660.00 in this weapon, and its discontinued, and NEVER BEEN FIRED. The price Im asking is not to bad. The price is Firm. I may consider a trade, but ONLY for a Glock 27, 30, 36, 38, or 39 these are the only  I want please do not offer me anything else.  also they must be in good shape as well.

S. Model of 1917 Enfield service rifle manufactured by Winchester.  This rifle is one of several purchased by my father and older brother from Sears & Roebuck some 45+ years ago when they were shipped to outlets in crates and could be had for a song – remember???.  To the best of my knowledge, this rifle has not been fired since it was purchased.  I am not a collector of these rifles, but I do shoot an Eddystone in vintage military rifle matches.

Overall I’d have to rate the condition of this rifle as very good when compared to many others I have seen.  The wood and metal show the normal battle scars of a rifle almost 100 years old.  I am not sure if all the parts are original.  I am not able to find a cartouche of any kind on the wood as I see on my Eddystone.  The barrel is marked with a “W” and “4-18” near the muzzle along with that little “winged O” symbol also seen on the left side of the action (see photos).  The bayonet lug is marked with a “W”.  The top side of the bolt handle is marked with a “W” and the bottom side is marked with what appears to be an “E”.  The magazine follower is not ground off as you often see in “parade rifles”.  I showed this rifle to some far more knowledgeable people at a recent vintage match and was told there is some muzzle erosion, but the “bullet test” showed the muzzle rifling to be good.  The rifling appears to be bright the full length of the barrel.

It is very tempting to take this rifle to the range to give her a run.  My Eddystone shoots very well and I have little doubt this Winchester will do the same.  If you have any questions please PM me and I will give you my phone number.

FTF transaction only and CCW license holders move to the front of the line, can add cash where needed. Thanks and take care"

It is a .280 Remington (7 mm Express Remington) w/Rear Tang Safety.  The rifle was customized by Match Grade Arms (MGA), Spring, Texas.  I had a Trigger job, Muzzle Break (80% reduction) and bed float done.  I had three rifles done by MGA, which they are noted for their accuracy and High quality workmanship.  (The others we a 77 in .300 Mag and a Sendero in 7mm Mag)  All three shot 1/4"" - 1/2"" groups @ 100yrds.  All three we like shooting a .243 (only louder).  One you could shoot all day and not get tired of shooting.  Is a very good Long range rifle.  It has a Redfield 6 X 18 5 Star rangefinder scope.  It has had less than 50 rounds through it, mostly sighting in at the range.  Rifle case would be included.

Prefer to sell, but may trade towards Alexander Arms or Les Baer 6.5 Grendel or Colt, Springfield or Kimber 1911's.   Could be a combination of the gun and cash, we'll work out the difference.  I will consider and either say """"Yes"" or ""I appreciate, but not at this time.""  Sold as is.  No LowBallers Please.

Thanks for looking!  Proof of residency required and if the buyer is out of state or needs shipping, then firearm must ship to a FFL dealer in your area and applicable shipping/handling charges will be covered at buyers expense.   Be willing to show Texas DL or give DL # from other states and sign a BOS or BOT."

The issues it has are as follows.. it leaks a small amount of coolant, it never overheats and the temp gage doesn't fluctuate. The 2nd issue is that the turn signal stalk is loose, the signals, cruise and wipers all still work. Just the brights don't come on. Also the rear brakes squeak once in an while if its wet out or has been sitting.(they DO NOT grind). It has newer front brakes and a newer Die Hard Gold battery.
