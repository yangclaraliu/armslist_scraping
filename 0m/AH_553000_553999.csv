The SpyderFly infuses traditional Balisong (or Butterfly) knife elements with innovative Spyderco features. Balis are all about swinging, sometimes called doing the dance. Eric Glesser, the designer of the SpyderFly, incorporates Spyderco’s Trademark Round Hole into both handles. The holes position the thumb and fingers (pinching either side of the handle) for superb control while indexing/rotating and enhancing fluidity of the swing. Contours and valleys lining the handle offer friction resistance keeping The Fly firmly in grip while maneuvering. A spring-loaded locking lever attaches to either handle for left- or right-hand use and locks the blade closed (but not open) for safe carry inside a pocket. Squeezing the handles together releases the lock’s lever. The blade is VG-10, that is hollow-ground and sharpened on one side only. Straight down the center of the blade, a dagger grind balances out both sides of the knife, again designed for smoother and even swinging. Manipulating the wire pocket clip to either handle or either side of the knife sets it up for a variety of carry options and draw positions. The SpyderFly links all that is utilitarian in a traditional Balisong with innovative features you’ve come to expect from Spyderco.

The conversion was done a very long time ago and possibly an armory conversion.  Its a 1884 model made in 1893, per the LWP proof.  Most of the stock proofs are still visible (LWP 1893, Circle P).  Their are added (#14, and 292) stamped into the stock.  These are more than likely rack numbers.  The stock has been refinished prior to me owning it.   The carbine has the standard US Springfield with  the eagle proof.  The barrel band has the correct ""U"" stamped on it.  The butt plate has the ""US"" proof, and has the trapdoor for the cleaning rod.  The sights are the correct time period buffington rear sight.  It has a original saddle bar but has a reproduction ring.  The barrel shows wear, but rifling is still good for a 119 year old gun.  Their are dings scrapes and stuff.  I have almost 2 full boxes of Black Powder ammo that comes with the rifle.  

I would like $650 or best reasonable offer for it.  But I would trade it for a older Gibson 5 string or 4 (tenor) banjo with a resonator back.  The rifle is worth more in parts but I don't want to part it out.   Reproductions cost $1500 but you get a original 1884 for $650.  I may consider other trades aswell, let me know what you have."

It is the full-size government model. It is in good condition with a blued finish. It has nice wood grips as well as the original colt plastic grips. It has a lightweight trigger that came from Nowlin Guns but also still has the original trigger included. It has an arched mainspring housing installed, but the original flat mainspring housing is included. It has a #316G spring kit installed from Wilson Combat, but still includes the original springs. It also has an aftermarket ambidextrous safety, but the original safety is included. Includes the original case, manual, and original colt 7 round magazine. I will restate that this is a used gun, the finish is worn and it does have some handling marks (it is an early 1991A1, so I'd say it was made most likely in 91 or 92). The white dots from the sights have worn away. It is an excellent shooter, is very reliable and accurate. I would suggest replacing the spring in the colt magazine as it is rather weak. My price of $650 is firm. I am not looking for trades unless someone has a Steyr M9-A1 (new model) and cash to offer. I will ship for additional cost, but would rather keep it to a FTF transaction. If you have any questions or would like any additional pictures, please email me or call REDACTED (leave a voicemail if I don't answer).

Not interested in hunting on your land, but interested in being able to set up targets, have distances measured, be able to leave a sun cover tent up, in the summer, and targets up, (obviously in good condition. I will not be using this for commercial purposes, but it is very difficult to find a range that allows true long gun shooting, and, when I shoot, I like to do it safely, which generally means being away form other people. Clean up brass and garbage each time out, and willing to discuss other requirements/suggestions. It would be nice to come home form work and grab a go bag and let off some steam. It would also be nice to have a table set up so as to be able to sight in a rifle properly, and without pressure and range concerns.

I am a licensed attorney, and would provide you with a release as to any injuries caused by me, as well as indemnifying you for any damage, although I am ethically advised to tell you to have another attorney review it. I am a handshake guy, and, as long as we communicate with activity on the area, chances of injury are minimal. form time to time I woudl probably like to bring out one or two people, but, again, not for commercial purposes. If you are a shooter/hunter, and have been looking for someone to shoot with, or put together a small range I am thinking it will not be that wide, but woudl like 500 yards max, this could be a nice project. although I am an avid Sporting clay person, due to the clays, I was not planning on asking to shoot clays out there. However, it would be nice to leave up a Caldwell Gong other reactionary targets, and be able to get out there and start shooting, instead of having to set up and take down each time.

If you are interested, please contact me. We can discuss details further. Obviously, we can write up a lot of documents and rules, and should, but this is a handshake understanding, in the sense, that no matter what you may charge for the privilege of shooting on your land, it is your land and it is a privilege to shoot on it.

These are becoming increasingly hard to find.I picked this up for 225 at a gun show, a good deal considering they are 450 at Maccabee arms, and hard to find under 300 at gun auction sites not including shipping and transfer.

This is in decent shape with exceptions. The previous owner took off most the bluing with steel wool giving it a sleek silver/black look. this one was used as a military training rifle. The stock is rugged and shows signs of use but has a clean finish. The number 98 is painted on the side. The inventory number. Receiver and trigger guard have matching serials, the bold does not. Not rust or pitting, clean bolt and decent bore.

If your looking for a collectors item this is not your gun, if your looking for a strong shooter, and an affordable hard to find mosin, this is for you.

i put a lot of work into this gun.  i think it's really funny how people are posting up thier AK's like theyre made of gold asking stupid high prices for them.  i know it's close to election time but these things aren't going to be banned.  $900 for a $550 gun with cheap crapco furniture?  $700 for a gun that is on the shelf of a local dealer for $500???  $750 for an unconverted saiga rifle with crapco t6???  come on... 

as i said before.  it just strikes me as funny.  if those rifles are demanding that kind of price, then my quality converted saiga 7.62x39 should bring at least $1500!!!

There are a few other handguns i am looking for but most are rare but a few are listed below.

I have done so much to the Mil-Spec 1911 A1 that I'm not sure where to start, Heres a few:
-Skelitonized Hammer

-Skelitonized  Trigger

-Trigger Reset

-Custom Comp Spring

-Parkerized Mil-Spec Black Grip Style Guide Rod

-Parkerized Mil-Spec Black Recoil Spring Plug

-Modified Black Wooden Grips & The Original Ones

-Magazine Parkerized Catch

-Enhanced Grip Spring

-(2) Specialized Metal Matching Mags

-(1) Chip McCormick X-mag 1911 Magazine

-Also comes with the BlackHawk Paddle & Belt Holster

-Cross Draw 1911 Holster

-Box of 50 .45  MagTec Hollow Point Rounds

 It has in my opinion the perfect trigger pull, it's got a really amazing how well the trigger job was done to comp Springfield specifications.
Almost everything From top to bottom has been worked on/replaced with superior enhanced parts or modified to make the best 1911 i could make.

I have had all the work done by Springfield custom shop and by professional gunsmiths. I hate getting rid of it but would like something a bit lighter because I'm disabled and can't carry the full weight of a 1911 anymore.

It has a 1/7 Govt. Profile Barrel, I think they balance better than the HBAR rifles. Included with it is a factory Bushmaster 30 round mag. I bought this in 2006 it has only made it out of the safe for pics. This is a rifle made in Maine, not the new Bushmasters made by Remington.
I bought the lower at Elmore's and ordered the upper from Bushmaster and snapped them together, so I don't have a box or manual. I do however have the box for the upper.

This is a flat-top with the removable carry handle/rear sight.

I am not looking for any trades on this, just cash.

I have a few amazing Dillon reloading presses to get rid of... her is what it looks like... MUST PICK UP (unless you want to pay actual shipping).

I think that these prices are very fair given Dillon stuff doesn't ever go down in value!  I am pretty firm on this so please do not shoot over lowball offers as they will be ignored.


First, I have a:
RL 1050: Like new, has been maintained and kept up!  This thing has very, very little use on her and functions perfectly.  She comes with everything needed to load 223... conversion, carbide dies, case feeder, akro bin and press cover.  The thing is in great shape and as you know, its quality Dillon... Est rounds loaded is 750-1000.... not much use at all.  This also comes with a Dillon digital scale as well some 223 brass. (No clue how much, its outdoor police range brass that I have not had a chance to count or clean.  I would guess well over 250-500 pieces, Im not counting it:)

Looking for: $1550.00

The second press is a Dillon XL 650.  This does NOT come with the case feeder however, one can be picked up from Dillon for just over $230.00 bucks.  It comes with Lee carbide dies .38/357 mag (with all conversion parts).  This comes with small primer system only, it has the small primer system and of corse Dillon no BS warranty, it only has about 3000 total rounds on it.  The machine is very nice (The pic of this machine shows a roller handle, it comes with standard handle, I have already sold the roller handle).

Looking for $550.00

Take them both for $2000.00 and Ill throw in an couple hundred rounds of   tumbled brass of .38 brass as well."

Sako 85 Grey Wolf Rifles have a series of actions which are designated Extra Short (XS), Short (S) and Short Magnum (SM), Medium action (M), and Long action (L). These actions offer traditional Sako features such as action sizes matched to cartridges, mechanical ejection, and integral tapered scope mount rails. Additionally, there is a controlled feed on all models to ensure reliable cartridge feed to the chamber in all situations.
The single-stage trigger pull is adjustable from 1 kg to 2 kg (2 to 4 lbs). The Sako 85 Grey Wolf safety features a mechanism that allows loading and unloading of the rifle with safety engaged. The magazine is detachable and can also be loaded through the ejection port. Magazine release is prevented against accidental release.
The Sako 85 Grey Wolf features the same all-stainless barreled action as its cousin, the Sako 85 Stainless Synthetic, combined with an attractive yet ultra-tough checkered grey laminated stock. The stock features classic American-style lines with its straight comb and sleek profile, plus a shadow-line cheekpiece on the left side. The stainless barreled action and warp-free stock makes the Sako 85 Grey Wolf perfect for hunting in extreme conditions while retaining the warm look and feel of a traditional wood stock.

EVER, many times when shot 25 shot groups at 45 yards (thats all I got in my yard) you cant put a pencil through the hole. I pore honey on my targets and shoot the fly, get most of them one after the other.  I have taken crows at well over 100 yards with it and its not hard to do if you are up to it. these are not your old pump. they are in a different class, even the best brake barrels don't even come close I know I have owned just about all of them at one time or another. ether of these guns has more energy a 100 yards than most have at the muzzle.
 I want $1100 for the S410 package and $2500 for the Day state. please ask for more info if you need it. but if you don't like the price go to the next ad."
