(United Arab Republic). There were only 8000 of these rifles made between 1966-1968 as per my research; as the Egyptian army switched over to the AK platform. I have only found numbers ranging between 2000 to 3000 being imported to the U.S.- Thus the rarity.
These are the Arab SKS ""Wannabe"" models with full wood, threaded muzzle and the knife bayonet. Comes with a removeable 10 round magazine, but made to be used with 10 round stripper clips. Everyone who I have had contact with who has owned a Rasheed has wished they never sold the one they had --- so that speaks loads to the popularity of these Carbines. 
The carbine has a rear safety and a trigger that has the feel of a custom gunsmith job.

It is new in the box, however I am the second owner.  I bought this off of a friend who lost his job just to help him out.  I have a second one and don't need this one.  It has never had a round through it, except the test shot from the factory.  I listed this earlier and I have gotten a LOT of interest.  For those seeing this again, thank you all for your offers.  

So here's the deal, I have a buyer for this gun at an outright cash price, but I am more interested in trading for a quality used piece versus just selling it outright.  I think it is worth roughly $1000 in trade.  

I also have a brand new in box Taurus Judge Public Defender.  This is brand new and I am the original owner.  I won this in a raffle and have no real need for it.  I think it is worth roughly $500 in trade.  This has never been fired, but for the factory test shot.  It is 2 1/2"" 410 or 45LC.  Basically the same goes as above.  

Anyway, I am entertaining offers on trades up or down in price.  The following list is fairly accurate as to what I am looking for, however feel free to make any offer, the worst I can say is no.  I am looking mostly for a carry gun for my wife, a smaller carry for myself, or tactical guns, though hunting, clay shooters, and any others are welcome too.  Let me know what you have, pics and details help.  Not to insult, but if it doesn't strike my fancy, I probably won't give you what you may be able to sell your trade for elsewhere.  

I'll try to make quick responses through my email.  Thanks again to all for looking and for all the offers."

 produced by Theodor Kommer Waffenfabrik GmbH, Zella Mehlis. It is almost an exact copy of the Belgian, FN Browning Model 1910. 
the Kommer Model 4 is not a commonly encountered pistol,German police and civil guard were known to carry as well as some officers.
 production about 1936 and ceased in 1940 with only a small quantity made during this period. A very difficult pistol to locate for ones collection. Right slide is blank.  Left side is stamped: Waffen Fabrik Kommer Zella-Mehlis Kal 7.65 (Zella-Mehlis was also the home of the Walther factory) Only other markings on handgun is the serial # on left trigger guard: 15,xxx  Eagle over N proof (used after 4/1/1940 throughout WWII). Of interest there are sights both intact front and rear with grooving running down top of the slide.  A left rear safety.  The magazine has a rear knurled clasp to release. pistol is in fair shape with slight pitting and wear on the slide only!!! . the bore is very bright, with very clean internals with hardly any wear, as if the pistol had sweat in a leather holster for years and hardly been shot. I have fired 2 magazines without a hiccup. crisp clean action! the pistol comes with two original magazines. prime example of a wartime nazi pistol, not many produced,,rare!!!! clearing out some wartime and pre war relic pistols, no trades accepted at this time.

This rifle is all original down to the battfield pick up finish and has all original parts minus the receiver. This gun was assembled using a correct Nodak Spud 1.6 MM RPK heavy receiver with correct reinforced trunnion areas and shoots like a dream. Barrel is in great shape with very minor pitting and strong rifling and is extremely accurate for an Ak type weapon as I have no problem hitting clay pigeons at 100 meters lying prone using the bipod. These M72 kits with the original barrels are nearly non-existent now and if you do find one you will pay $600-$800 just for a kit so I believe my price is fair. This would be great to add to a military collection because of its originality and true battlefield look or you could refinish the gun and make it look new again but I perferred to leave it the way it came off the battlefield. Drum and sling in Picture are not included but I will include the one 30 round Yugo Bold hold open mag that came with the kit. May consider a partial Cash/Trade for Ak-47's, 7.62x39 ammo, or .223/5.56 ammo but at least $500 in cash must be included in the deal. Cash price is Firm. E-mail, Call, or text, REDACTED"

I purchased this firearm sometime ago and used is primarily while on duty as a backup gun.  I switched to a .380 a year or so later and it has been in the cabinet ever since.  Gun is in great shape with only about 150 rounds through it.  Great for a conceal carry gun as it fits in a front or back pocket nicely.

Here's my response:
1. $119 is the price for somebody with an FFL license, not an individual.
2. That price does not include shipping.
3. That price does not include state sales tax.
4. That price does not include a scope.

I had to purchase the gun through Bradis Guns, and their price to me was $149.95 plus tax.  I have also added a 4x15 Tasco scope valued at $10 from Wal-Mart.

Total costs invested in rifle are: $149.95 + $10.50 tax + $10.50 for scope equals $170.95.  Your cost is $125, so you are saving $45.95 from my purchase price.

The Remington Model 1100 Competition is super-tuned for the competitive scene. By over-boring the 30"" barrel and lengthening the forcing cones, we improved shot-to-shot pattern consistency and made what was one of the softest-recoiling actions in the world even easier on your shoulder. The receiver and all internal parts feature a nickel-Teflon finish for the smoothest, most reliable cycling ever. It’s optimized for 2 3/4"" target loads and light field loads. Its optional adjustable comb can be fine-tuned to your shooting preference, and the barrel has a 10mm target-style rib. All these, plus a host of other upgrades, transform an already legendary design into an unstoppable force at the range.

More than 40 years ago, the Model 1100 forever changed the way American shooters viewed autoloading shotguns. It was the first autoloader to combine the repeat-shot versatility of early-century models with the sleek, modern lines and handling qualities of revered double barrels.
It's been a field-proved favorite ever since. Its superb balance, handling, durability and soft recoil from the gas operated action are the foundation of the Remington autoloading legacy.

Remington 870 Model Magnum, 12 Gauge, 18.5"" Cylinder Bore, Factory Magazine Tube Extension. Custom ghost ring rear sight and Trijicon Front Blade sight installed. The Front sight has a very faint glow. Carries 6+1 capacity and features the U-cut in the shell elevator. Original stock is included and has some wear on the right side.

Also selling an original Remington Police Folding Stock w/ LEO roll mark. This particular example is not the best. It does have scuffs and the bluing is fading in some spots. I have cleaned it up the best I can. However, functionally, it is sound and has held up to magnum rounds with no problem. I've seen most of these go for almost $200 if mint. Comes with a custom cut 5 shell nylon carrier.

I have personally only shot about 50 rounds of 00 Buck. Previous owner says to have shot less than 200. For it's age, it is in great shape. Action feels very good and it preformed flawlessly with magnum rounds. Finish is in good condition too.

Asking $400
Only reason why I am selling, as much as I love this shotty, is because I already have other shotguns and I don't shoot this as much as I'd like.

Will ship: No

Other info: I'm the second owner. I purchased this from a friend. Both of us have taken great care of this pistol. Only a couple hundred rounds down the pipe (if that) and it is in excellent condition. No holster wear, scuffing, etc. Has the original box and locking key. This model is DA/SA. NOT DAO.

It will come with 7 factory magazines. 5 are 10 round mags. 2 are 13 round mags that will be given disassembled. There are XGrips spacers on three of the mags to give a feel of a full size grip. All other mags have the grip extension to accomodate the small finger. I believe I have the flat plate for two mags as well, you will simply need to swap them. All are in excellent condition."
