This is a Philippine made 1911 and its a ton of gun for the money. This has been used at the range, never carried and not used in a holster. It looks great. The bluing is excellent and its been flawless after break-in with 230gr ball ammo, which is all I have ever used in it. I would estimate it has 400-500 rounds though it.

Series 186, made November 1997.  I bought this gun new in early 1998 during the assault weapons ban.  It caught my eye as it had a factory flash suppressor, which was unavailable on civilian model Mini 14s at the time.  The dealer said that it was a limited edition and Ruger made 1000 of them, and the largest Ruger dealers got two each.  I have never seen another one like it. Yes, there are other Minis with a flash suppressor, and other Minis with a green laminated stock, but I have never seen another one in this particlar configuration from the factory. This is a true Mini-14 with the military type sights, and not a Ranch rifle with the v-blade rear sight.

It is like new, always kept in a climate controlled gun safe.  I have fired about 50 round through it to test the high capacity magazines, which includes a 40, 30, and a new factory Ruger 20 round mag that says Law Enforcement Only, along with two of the factory five round mags, one unopened.

Only about 18,000 of these gas powered semi-automatic carbines were manufactured. It is believed that fewer than 6,000 survived destruction during the UN-led disarming initiative after the Balkan wars. The Albanian SKS has a longer handguard than most SKS’s, an AK-style charging handle, a buttplate with two trapdoors instead of one, a Y shaped folding spike bayonet instead of the more traditional x shaped cruciform, a differently-contoured magazine than other SKS’s, and a sling swivel on the left side of the buttstock.The Albanians called their SKS the “July 10th” Rifle, named after the anniversary of the centralization of the Albanian National Liberation Army in 1942 to fend off fascist Italy. We have obtained a very small quantity of these rare SKS military rifle. These won’t last long!

I bought it today for around $350, new...mainly because I have a ton of .40 ammo and wanted to have a cheap reliable gun.  Well, I took it to the range and I honestly can't stand the thing.  I've shot 100 rounds through it.  In my shooting, the slide locked back twice with rounds in the mag...but I think that's because my thumb was on the slide release.  I'm not sure, and honestly at this point don't care...I was just not a fan of how it shoots, recoils, etc.  So there, an honest description.  
With this gun goes my .40 ammo collection.  I have 7 full boxes of factory practice rounds(50 packs), a couple boxes of wwb personal protection, and probably 50-100 expensive hollowpoints(mainly win pdx1).  So if you do the math, this would easily cost you over $200.  So, essentially you could say the gun is only $100. 
I've not registered the gun with S&W yet, so you can do that and also get the lifetime warranty.  Serious interested buyers and I'll get some exact ammo counts, I just did a walkthrough.  I will -not- come down on price."

Stainless steel L-frame, six shot .357 Magnum. It has a 4-inch barrel and its original Hogue black rubber monogrip. Overall excellent condition, with extremely minor wear--the sort of almost invisible surface scratches that are inevitable on high polish stainless. The action is very smooth and timing excellent. This is the dash -4 version meaning it is made before S&W implemented its internal trigger lock and the cheaper MIM parts found in today's Smith & Wessons. The dash 4 is considered by most to be the ultimate vintage for a standard production 686, which is itself considered by many to be the ultimate .357 caliber revolver, at least in this price range.

I happened across a second 686 so now I have doubles and no need for this one. I'm looking to trade it for something I don't already have instead. I'll consider just about any offer, but I'll include a partial list of things I'm particularly interested in of relatively equal value for reference.

I may be willing to throw in an Alessi Fieldmaster shoulder holster rig to make the right trade happen. The holster portion swivels inside of a sheath for easy draw and had two speed loader pouches opposite. These cost $235 new.

Must have valid Alabama driver's license for FTF trade. Having a CCW permit is a nice reassurance as well."

We have 6 spots left in our upcoming North Carolina CCH / CCW Concealed Pistol Training class this Sunday.

The course is instructed by seasoned firearms instructor, Roger Pettit.
Roger is fully licensed and fully insured (Lloyd's of London) and we hold the class on an actual gun range. He has a great sense of humor and has great stories being he's an ex-marine, bounty hunter, and has worked with multiple military contractors. The cost of the class is $85 a person OR $150 ($75 each) if you bring along a friend. This price is ALL INCLUSIVE meaning this price includes course work, red book, certificate, drinks and pizza for lunch, and Roger even supplies guns and ammo if you choose not to bring your own!!! No tricks or gimmicks here! If you don't have experience, no worries! Roger will get you up to pace during the class. If you've done any research on CCH you know $85 is CHEAP and alternatives NEVER include this much. The classes are small (10-20) and Roger has years of experience teaching them in multiple states. If interested let me know and check out the website info: www.PCShooting.com.

The next class is October 21st. Location is ~25 minutes outside Cary, NC down US-1 at LCWC.

Email if interested as seats are limited. Email can be found on our listed website.

BE PREPARED for any possible madness come the end of this year!

Hope to see you there!

***NOTE: Rails, Gas Block, End Cap, and Gas Tube are PENDING FUNDS. They are sold when they disappear from this ad.  If this message disappears and they are still listed, then they are still available.***

Yankee Hill Machine Lightweight Free-Float Rail Tube - Rifle Length  $75 (MSRP $175.50)

YHM-9636
 These forearms utilize our anti-rotation screws to insure that the 
forearm stays solid even under strenuous use. Perfect for use with 
forward grips and optics. Features include: mounting
 points for our Swiveling Sling Studs (YHM-9469), Mil. Spec. Picatinny 
rails, and they accept our Forearm End Caps. The barrel nut and forearm 
tube are made of aircraft quality aluminum and hardcoat anodized to Mil.
 Specs. The jam nut is made from steel and plated a matte black to 
match. All assemblies include: one jam nut, one barrel nut, 2 
anti-rotation screws, and one forearm tube. Overall length: 12.5 inches.Weight 14.75 oz.

- Overall very good condition, with a few slight marks on the rails.  These are cosmetic only and do not effect use of the rails.
- Barrel nut, Jam nut, and Anti-rotation screws included if you want them; the barrel nut and anti-rotation screws show minor marring from installation and removal.  Once installed I don't think this will be visible.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Yankee Hill Machine Forearm End Cap - $10 (MSRP $22)

Use these screw-in end caps to dress up and provide protection for the 
end of your YHM forearm. Does not interfere with the free floating of 
your barrel and helps keep out debris. Drilled to allow for proper heat 
venting. Both models fit all handguards that will accept our endcaps. 
The ""B"" model is for heavy barrels and has an inside diameter of 1.050 
inches, and the ""A"" model is for all other barrels and has an inside 
diameter of 0.925 inches.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
Yankee Hill Machine Specter Two-Piece Gas Block - $25 (MSRP $46)

YHM-9378
The design of this gas block allows the user to mount forearms that 
extend beyond the standard gas return system. Provided the inside 
diameter of the forearm is 1-5/8” or greater. It allows the mounting of 
our forearms without the removal of your pinned or welded muzzle 
accessory. This gas block consists of a simple, durable, two-piece 
design that is mounted by the use of four socket head cap screws using a
 7/64"" Allen wrench. Made from high quality steel and finished with a 
Mil. Spec. phosphate coating.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yankee Hill Machine Black Plated Gas Tube Carbine Length - $5 (MSRP $18.75)

Standard on the YHM-15 rifles and carbines. Our black plated gas tubes look better than a standard gas tube when used on our lightweight or diamond series forearms. Includes gas tube pin.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Troy Industries Professional Grade Rifle Receiver Sling Adapter with QD Sling Swivel - $35 (MSRP $49)

The Troy Rifle Receiver Sling Adapter enhances reliability by securing receiver extension nut prevents rotation of buffer tube
Installs in less than 2 minutes
No gunsmithing required
Hardened T6 aluminum construction
Includes blackened stainless push down button Q.D. swivel
Made in the USA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GG&G 1.5"" Receiver Sling Adapter (Right Side) - $15

Magpul XT Rail Covers - $15
2x 6.25""
2x 2.25""
1x 2""
1x 3.75""
These can be cut to different sizes.  As you can see by the variety of lengths, I did this.

Make offer on upper

Took this rifle in on trade from a friend of mine, the upper is an original colt sp1 it is not very pretty (receiver shows some ware and scratches) but I've been plinking around the farm with it for a couple weeks.  It shoots and functions perfectly 8-13"" steel plate at 100yrds all day and I dumped a couple mags as fast as I could go and every thing worked flawlessly.  Good rifle.  Lower is a modern A2 Bushmaster.  Will sell just the upper (make offer) or the whole rifle for 700obo
I might have cash to trade up depends on the day

Below is what I have for trade.  I can include cash for the right deal. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

1. Rock River AR-15: This is an upgraded M4 style (military tacitical style with short, lightweight barrel). It has an upgraded RRA Operator stock (as opposed to the standard RRA tactical stock on the unfired AR), a free float quad rail (as opposed to the standard handguard that you can't mount anything to), a winter trigger guard, front flip up sight (instead of stationary), a tactical muzzle break, two-stage trigger (very nice trigger), ergonomic grip (as opposed to the standard hogue), and a chrome lined barrel. It has two magazines through it and is in perfect condition (no blemishes, scratches, scuffs). I also have a bunch of accessories: extra magazines, ammo, Lucid HD7 red dot sight with 3x magnifier, soft and hard carry cases. The Lucid is an awesome red dot.  I have it installed on another AR I have, but have never shot the AR with the sight mounted to the gun. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

2. Kimber 1911: It has new Trijicon night sights. It's in perfect condition. I have everthing it came with originally and a bunch of extra aftermarket and factory magazines (after markets are actually known to be more reliable than the Kimber mags). I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

3. Glock 21sf: .45 caliber Glock with the short frame (""SF""). The SF style has a more manageable slimmer grip. Feels a lot less like a brick! It has new Meprolight night sights. I have over 10 magazines for it. Excellent condition with everything it came with originally. I have other Glocks as well, but not sure I can part with them. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

4. Sig Sauer P238 Gambler: This is a limited edition by Sig. It's similar to the Rosewood edition but has the word ""The Gambler"" etched in gold on the side of the slide and a ""dead man's"" poker hand on the top. It is no longer being manufactured by Sig, so it has collector value in addition to being one of the best pocket pistols available. It has not been fired and is new in the box it came in with one magazine and a paddle holster.  It has the new style snag free night sights.  I also have a Crossbreed Minituck for it as well (best IWB holster you can buy in my opinion).  The holster is made to fit the gun with a Crimson Trace laser attached to the trigger of the gun.  I have the laser as well. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL.

5. Sig Sauer P220 Carry Equinox: never fired, a few extra magazines. Has TruGlo TFO night sights. I AM NOT LOOKING TO SELL."

Matching numbers Norinco SKS with original stock which needs refinishing and a black polymer stock.  It also comes with the original fixed magazine as well as a 20 round removable Tapco magazine.  The safety is loose and will not remain in the safe position and for some reason the bolt does not always return all the way forward so it must be bumped into battery (this may just be ammo related, I've only tried Tula).
