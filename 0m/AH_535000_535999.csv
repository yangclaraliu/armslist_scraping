Mechanically this gun functions well, bore is clean and finish is very good.  (Accessories in picture not included in sale).  Will consider trades.  Preferrably handguns.

The Cobra Tactical delivers reliability and firepower with a 5 + 1 capacity magazine. This easy to maneuver, short barrel pump shotgun comes with a standard molded stock. The Cobra Tactical has one feature that truly separates it from the competition; it comes with a return spring in the forearm. This allows the user to pull back on the forearm to eject the shell and then simply release.  The spring returns the forearm back to position and shucks another shell into the chamber in one extremely fast motion, allowing for a quicker reload.

So my color scheme is a bit lighter in color. Also comes with hardshell case.

O.k. the extras and I do mean EXTRAS. Roughly 2500 rounds of ammo(mix of predominately .223 but some actual 5.56 NATO), 27(yep 27) 30rd magazines. Also a mix of brass and steel cased ammo. Mostly steel cased as it was cheaper than brass. However, the gun has never had one hiccup in eating through steel cased ammo. I've only experienced one issue and that was with one of the magazines(which might be a weak spring or follower having issues). I've shot around 2500-3500rds through the gun and it's performed flawlessly. Been cleaned after every trip to the range.

Reason(s) I'm selling is I also have an AK47(which I also have many mags for, not as many as the AR LOL!!) and the ammo is cheaper for 7.62 but the main reason is I'm upgrading to an AR50 , yep going .50 BMG, I think it's time for me.

Price breakdown:
1. AR15 with grip, sling, hardcase and scopes asking: $800 obo
2. AR15 with all the former + 27 magazines: $1000
3. AR15 with everything before + ammo & ammo cans: $1500 FIRM!!

Reason I'm a $1500 firm for everything, is I'm basing the price of the ammo when I bought it(roughly 2007-2008 ). .223 and 5.56 ammo has gone up. I figured at .21 cents a round I've got about $600 tied up in ammo. Now keep in mind, it's not all .223 ammo. I've got some actual 5.56 NATO ammo in there as well, which was more.

Ruger LCP .380 ACP with Lasermax

I am the original owner; purchased it a few months ago. 62 flawless rounds through it (yes, I'm one of those people who counts rounds through their guns. I can even give ammo details - all factory brass FMJ rounds and even have the mfr names). Pistol is in excellent condition.

For those coming from an LC9, the LCP does not have a mag disconnect safety (LCP will fire a chambered round with mag out) or an external safety; basically, it didn't get the Commiefornia treatment the LC9 did. It does have a chamber indicator window, so you can tell with a glance if the chamber is loaded and don't need to do a press check.

Includes original box, mag (Ruger ships with only 1 mag), manual, mag extended baseplate, soft zippered case, factory test-fired casing, gun lock, Lasermax manual and hex wrench for laser calibration.

For those who like Nutnfancy's reviews (comprehensive, but longish): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR-uRVn4irQ

Buyer must have NC drivers license and either pistol purchase permit or NC CHP. We will both get copies of the bill of sale.

I'm also selling (all accessories in excellent condition; all available for sale individually or in any combination you want):
-genuine Ruger LCP mag: $22
-Hogue Hybrid Grip for LCP: $9
-Wolff Springs recoil calibration kit for LCP (if you want to change to stiffer recoil springs); includes #11, #12 and #13 spring sets: $20

You will receive a nearly brand new Ruger 10/22 inside an Archangel Marauder stock. Only about 2000 rounds shot through it. It will come with a  CLONE EO tech 553 red dot scope. This is a nearly brand new CLONE holographic scope, it is the best clone on the market in my opinion. It is completely visible in the daytime and  can be switched between a red and green dot and has brightness settings. Also the outside of it is protected with metal it is very sturdy. You will also receive a nearly brand new magpul forgrip. Also with this purchase you will receive 2 Ruger BX-25 round magazines and a ruger 10 round magazine. Also you will receive a little over 1000 rounds of various .22 rounds. I will also include the Archangel Marauder magazine but I will say that it does not work well. But don't be fooled the kit is VERY well made. It is made of a VERY sturdy polymer. You will most likely have to buy another clone mag online if you want.The magazine that comes with the kit does not have steal feed lips and does not sit well which makes it prone to jamming. I have done research on their clone mags and it seems that they have done a lot of upgrading to the new ones. With the BX-25 round magazines included it works flawlessly though.

+ Restore to Original Configuration by Removing Mount and Reinstalling the Rear Sight

This new scope mount has been designed to provide lower ""visual alignment"" mounting for scout scopes. Solid cross bolt mounting to the rear sight base with a locking nut insures solid and rigid installation and is a major improvement over the mounting systems of earlier generation scout mounts which use two mounting screws that can strip out the mount and work loose - and which are still being sold by many vendors at gun shows and on the internet.

RING SPECIFICATIONS:
+ Strong Lightweight Aluminum
+ Non-Slip Mounting
+ Matte Black Finish
+ Medium Height Profile
+ One Inch Diameter
+ New in Box
+ Fits Weaver Style Bases or Picatinny Rail

The M3X Tactical Illuminator was built for U.S. Special Operations personnel and designed to perform under the most rigorous conditions and survive the harshest environments. Because of this, the M3X is built to go as deep as 66ft. and still remain waterproof.

Now equipped with a high-performance LED that delivers a peak output of 150+ lumens, the M3X LED is built to these same tough standards. Powered by two (2) 3V 123 lithium batteries (included), the M3X LED has a run time of two (2) hours.




Long Gun
The M3X long gun backplate, interchangeable with all other M3X and M6X backplates, utilizes a 3-position toggle-switch backplate for Off, Momentary On and Constant On. The straight cord touch-pad remote, which is used on rifles and semi-auto shotguns, allows the user to activate the Momentary On feature. For pump action shotguns an optional curly cord remote is available.


The Rail-Grabber™ mount fits most rail configurations whether for a pistol, rifle or shotgun. The Rail-Grabber interface utilizes a screw-adjustable locking plate that can be tightened to insure a rock solid fit. The Rail-Grabber mount is particularly recommended for heavy recoiling firearms.

I just Dont have any Use for it and Im Cleaning out the Closet for a Move. Here are the details ""Copy and pasted from Manufacturers Web site""

         Since 1959, the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on for survival should they have to punch out over a remote area. Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well. 

Today, it's a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that's easy to carry but has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

       When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, waterproof stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action.

The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments. Plus, the updated receiver is grooved making it easy to top it off with your favorite optics.

The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is available in Black and Camo finishs. All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight.
