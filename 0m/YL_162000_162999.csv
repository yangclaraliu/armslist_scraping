Everyone is different about what parts they want and work they want done on their 1911 and with this said this may or may not be what you are looking for in a 1911. This is what has been done to the gun:

45 degree crowning of barrel
Throating of the barrel
Polishing of the throat and ramp
Lowering of the ejection port
Flaring of ejection port
Les Baer flat M/S housing SS serr.
Removing the locking mechanism from the M/S housing and adding a pin
Wilson Combat ultralight match long trigger (three hole)
Wilson Combat High ride stainless bullet proof beavertail
Wilson Combat deluxe commander bullet proof hammer (skeleton)
Trigger job along with reliability package

I bought this from Academy Sports the day it came in and it cost me $758 out the door (receipt in hand 6/14/11). The parts and gunsmith work was little over $800 (received back from gunsmith 7/7/11). Again this was what I wanted, brand, style and it being a GI Mil-Spec in stainless steel. This was cheaper then buying a bare slide and receiver and building up. If your looking for a regular stainless steel GI Mil-Spec this is NOT the one, but if you are looking for a 1911 with some custom work done and room for more custom work then this may be the gun.

I would really like to trade for a full sized .357, or a .45, or 9mm pistol.  Single action, double action, I'll consider any quality handgun.
If you're looking for a good carry .357, you can't do much better then an SP101.

This has the newer recoil spring so no worries about shooting low powered ammo. 

There is no cosmetic damage to the gun except that some of the finishing on the edges of the slide stop/release is showing some wear. I have a friend who has a gen4 22 and his did the same thing not sure why the slide stop/release is prone to finish wear. Comes with everything which came in the original package including the paperwork, loader, med and large backstraps, cleaning rod, etc. Comes with a total of 3 10rd factory glock magazines. I will also throw in a 100rd box of WWB 115g and also comes with an un-installed Ghost 3.5lb Rocket Connector. This is the connector which cleans up the trigger pull and also helps eliminate over-travel. I just have not had the time to install it. 

I am firm on the price and I have more pictures available. Must be able to meet FTF in the Niagara and Erie region. Will not ship.

Some information about these cartridges:

http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vaabenhistoriskselskab.dk%2Farma-dania%2F_AD_patroner_view.php%3Feditid1%3D53&act=url



This link contains a photo of a cartridge with a knurled ring near the base.

I believe this knurled ring signifies a reloaded cartridge, due to other cartridges on that site remarking on this knurled ring.


This ammunition I am selling does not have this knurled ring, which would lead me to believe that this brass is new/unfired.


I am assuming this brass is Berdan primed due to the country of origin and time frame of manufacture ... but the truth is I haven't disassembled any of the ammunition to find out.


Headstamps are mixed.


Pics are representative headstamps that I found after about 30 seconds of digging through the box.

Cool ammo for the Swede Mauser collector or shooter

Price : asking $20/box of 100

If you ain't got a youth stock but you do have an old wood buttstock that you aren't using, I think I could cut it down and replace the recoil pad and make it fit for her.  We don't have a lot of money and this police academy and the gas to get her down there every week are killing us but if you can help us out for a decent price I'll find a way to come up with the cash.  I'm not trying to give a sob story guys but the $60+ they're asking for a new set is crazy to me not to mention way out of my price range.  Let me know folks.  Thank you in advance."

The barrel is chambered in 5.56 N.A.T.O, 14.5"", fluted, chrome lined, 1:7"" twist, and has a YHM Phantom flash suppressor professionally permanently installed. The handguard is a YHM free-floating riffle length diamond handguard, and has the optional end-cap installed. The fit and finish is amazing on this upper and everything is 100% brand new and unfired. The 14.5"" fluted barrel looks much better than the 16"" barrels most AR's have. The barrel exceeds 16"" with the silver soldered Phantom flash suppressor, so it is legal to own in every state. The price for just the upper is $550, which is MUCH lower than I paid for it. If the buyer would like, I will include a brand new Bravo Company BCM Mil-Spec, full-auto bolt carrier group and new charging handle for an extra $100 which would total $650 for everything. I have around $900 invested in the upper, including parts and gunsmithing. I will not sell just the BCG or charging handle separately. This ad is cross posted on another forum, so the first one to send a message saying that they want it will be honored. Thanks for looking.

*EDIT: This listing does not include the complete lower receiver. It was an extra lower I just built, used to demonstrate the fit and finish. I wasn't looking to sell the lower, but have had a couple interested in the complete gun. I may consider selling the complete gun with a few magazines and case. I will address any serious inquires"

I am currently searching for M1 Garand in good condition but will consider other Military Rifles such as the  AK 74, AK 47, Bushmaster AR, or M1A, 

For the right rifle I would consider trading or Cash $950

Early 1978 Romanian PSL which was assembled in Romania and ship in its complete form to the states. This rifle was brought into the states by TGI, in its assembled form and not touched by them, it was sold as it was from the Romania. The rifle is all matching numbers.

PSL will come with 5 MATCHING mags that are matched and marked with the rifles serial number. Also included is the PSO Scope which is the LPS 4x6 TIP2, complete with Rubber Eye Piece and scope lens cover. In addition is the amber lens that is not normally found in current PSL's that goes with the scope.

Included also would be the Scope Cover, and Magazine/Scope carry case
There is a COMPLETE cleaning kit which includes 3 piece cleaning rod, Brown leather pouch, oil bottle, cleaning kit cylinder tube with additional cleaning tools inside. Broken shell extractor, screw driver/take down tool and original Romania Leather Sling. 

It is worth noting that this Rifle has NEVER BEEN FIRED (with the exception of the Romanian Arsenal that I assume test fired it before shipping it). 
It has not been fired by me, it is as it was when I purchased it new 6 years ago.

The rifle has been primarily a ""Safe Queen"".... 

Trades would need to be in similar condition, value or supplement with 
cash, ammo, etc

For the right rifle  I would consider trading or Cash Price $950

Early 1978 Romanian PSL which was assembled in Romania and ship in its complete form to the states. This rifle was brought into the states by TGI, in its assembled form and not touched by them, it was sold as it was from the Romania. The rifle is all matching numbers.

PSL will come with 5 MATCHING mags that are matched and marked with the rifles serial number. Also included is the PSO Scope which is the LPS 4x6 TIP2, complete with Rubber Eye Piece and scope lens cover. In addition is the amber lens that is not normally found in current PSL's that goes with the scope.

Included also would be the Scope Cover, and Magazine/Scope carry case
There is a COMPLETE cleaning kit which includes 3 piece cleaning rod, Brown leather pouch, oil bottle, cleaning kit cylinder tube with additional cleaning tools inside. Broken shell extractor, screw driver/take down tool and original Romania Leather Sling. 

It is worth noting that this Rifle has NEVER BEEN FIRED (with the exception of the Romanian Arsenal that I assume test fired it before shipping it). 
It has not been fired by me, it is as it was when I purchased it new 6 years ago.

The rifle has been primarily a ""Safe Queen"".... 

Trades would need to be in similar condition, value or supplement with 
cash, ammo, etc

Scope is a Bushnell Elite 4200 8-32x40 and comes with a sunshade (not pictured).  

The barrel was properly broke in, only 100 rounds--1 box of bullets--down the tube.  Rifle shows great potential using a Hornady 68 gr BTHP.  The target is a 4 shot group at 100 yards shot at the windy West Riverside range.  I’m sure the rifle could do much better in someone else hands, and definitely after experimenting with some different loads.   The 69 gr Hornady is the only bullet I’ve tried in the rifle.

I'm looking to trade a complete 55 gallon ball python setup. Comes with a pretty stout black wooden stand (it was made to hold a full aquarium). Stand has cabinets underneath for storage Has a few extras: 2 different hides, water dish, large under tank heater on the left side, screen top, and a medium exoterra waterfall (not pictured). The waterfall works fine, but I took it out cause the snake kept going to the bathroom in it and it was a pain to clean out. I think I have one other hide and a good sized piece of drift wood somewhere, I'll have to see if I can find them. I kept the original aquarium hoods and set them on top of the screen to hold it down. Also put some blue light bulbs in them, looks pretty cool at night. It should work fine if you want to use it as an aquarium, but it hasn't been full of water in almost 4 years so no guarantees.

Looking to trade the whole setup for AR-15 parts (stripped lowers, lower parts kits, barreled uppers, magazines, 5.56 ammo, decent optics, pretty much anything AR related). Or you can make me a cash offer. If you're interested you can text me at REDACTED."
