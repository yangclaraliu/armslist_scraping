The MWG 90 Rounder high capacity magazine for the AR-15/M16 provides you with the finest in state-of-the-art high capacity magazine design. The 90 Rounder's innovative snail-drum design and advanced space-age materials are combined to create a very light, completely reliable, low maintenance, high capacity magazine that will withstand a level of heavy field use that would destroy a metal magazine, while weighing 33% less.

The 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 is designed for 5.56mm NATO or .223 Remington ammunition.

The 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 is designed to be close to maintenance free. Never remove the silver-gray Teflon lubricant powder. Never Use any oil-based lubricant. Never disassemble MWG products, and never disassemble the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 .

The 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 contains small parts & springs that may cause injury if improperly released. If repairs are required, return the magazine to MWG Company for repair. Any disassembly, alteration, re-adjustment, improper installation, or misuse of any MWG product voids all warranties.

Never attempt to load the 90 Rounder into the weapon or detach the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 from the weapon, with a cartridge in the chamber. Always lock the bolt back first and visually ensure the chamber is empty.

Because of its unique design, the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 can be left partially loaded for an extended period of time, but never store the 90 Rounder with more than 80 rounds loaded. Leaving the 90 Rounder for the stored with more than 80 rounds loaded may damage the springs and cause the weapon to malfunction. Never attempt to load more than 90 rounds. Loading more than 90 rounds may damage the magazine.

Always avoid lethal situations whenever possible. High capacity magazines such as the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 are intended to eliminate re-loading downtime for persons in unavoidable potentially lethal situations, but no product can fully protect the user from injury or death in a firefight. The knowing use of MWG products, when a potentially lethal situation could be avoided, will constitute an assumption of the known risks of engaging in a lethal situation.

Today's tactical fixed blade knives still resemble the first Bronze Age daggers of 4000 years ago, especially in their handle design. Michael Martinez, sculptor, inventor, and martial artist, didn't start out to redesign the fixed blade, but he explains, ""In my edged weapons training, I kept noticing how many knives didn't feel right, didn't have a grip that gave both control and comfort in the four fundamental tactical grips."" Michael's design firm, Group Design, Inc., reached out to a team of medical specialists for the answer. Their Ultima™ achieves 22 out of 23 ideal contact points with its unique patent-pending handle.

The injection-molded black glass filled nylon scales feature over 70 triangular grip segments, separated by sipes, or ""ooze grooves"" which channel away water, mud and oil. Horizontal grooves are placed under the fingertips for optimum feel.

Because tactical knives are inevitably used as pry bars, Michael's team created a butt pry tip as an extension of the blade tang, with a rounded tip.

The smaller Ultima models feature 4.95"" full-tang blades of 1.4116 stainless steel with a light bead-blast finish. It is available with Razor-Sharp or Combination Razor-Sharp and Veff™ Serrated edges.

Serrated models feature our patented* Veff™ Serrated edges. Developed by Oregon City, Oregon, knife designer Tom Veff, these serrations are wide and angled at 60° to the edge. The resulting cutting points bite instantly and dig deep upon contact, slicing smoothly and effortlessly. They give dramatically improved cutting ability on rope, webbing, strapping, hoses and leather.

An injection-molded black polypropylene Ultima Trainer is also available.

Tactical Sheath. The Ultima's custom black high-strength nylon fabric/glass filled nylon sheath has an injection-molded liner. Dual belt loops are Velcro® adjustable. For maximum versatility, there are ample grommets with a length of 550 paracord included, an adjustable leg strap, plus a slotted sheath back that can mount on MOLLE gear. Removable security handle straps with snaps give access and security. A utility pocket with a Fastex™ buckle will carry a variety of folding knives, multipurpose tools or sharpeners.

This car has a limited slip differential, with a ACT stage 2 clutch. I also lightened the flywheel down to 13.5 pounds. Its got a Neuspeed strut bar and Nology spark plug wires. Tires are Eagle F1. Interior is nice accept for the drivers door panel, my cat apparently got in it and clawed up the door panel. I found one at Pull a Part for $50, but I have yet to purchase it and put it on. A/C and heater work great. Text or Email if you want to take a look. four o five six 4 two 3 nine 3 five."

I'm not too familiar with these rifles so feel free to ask questions or get me to take more pictures of certain areas.

Rifle has a Lyman 57WJS rear sight on it and a dovetailed blade front sight with a small brass or copper insert. On the top of the receiver are the markings C.L.S. I am not sure what they stand for. The bolt may or may not have been bent back a bit, I just don't know what bolts came with what models. All the metal parts I can see match the receiver though.

The stock is in less than great shape just because of how many modifications were attempted. A pistol grip was added and screwed and glued on. Looks like doing so cracked the wrist area and there is a brass rod going though. It was either to reinforce it, or was the original problem. The rifle has a decelerator pad added and is missing the sling swivels.

Overall it has a few problems but should be a good source of hard to find parts or at least a sporter if you wanted to rebarrel it. I think it is currently in the original caliber of 8x58r.

I found something i want but guy needs cash so i lowered price this is a steal ----------->FIRST ""G"" TAKES IT HOME !

AMT Automag III .30 CARBINE semi-auto stainless steel hunter Automag Kit.
I am the original owner of this handgun i purchased it in 1981-82 and have fired it around 200 cartridges to zero scope and millet adjustable target sites.
I cannot find any cosmetic issues it really shows like new being kept in its case nearly 30 years.
The original scope was a weaver 2x but it sports a bushnell troghy 
multi-dot / cross hair optic. the scope mount is detachable letting you bring the .30 carb back to a non-scoped version in a minute while the scope mount is factory fitted never looses its adjustment  when re-installed. This firearm has never malfunctioned and while at the range you need to keep everything of value behind the muzzle as it is really a 2ft. flame thrower using winchester hp's. Very accurate well beyond 100 yards with muzzle energy , ft. pounds and velocity exceeding that of a .357 magnum using optimum hunting loads available from wisconsin cartridge co. 
This package deal also comes with a U.S.A. MADE SHOULDER HOLSTER and spare magazine case with bullet loops. 
I really am not in a hurry to part with this AUTOMAG just seeing what trades might be out there. 
I am just kinda bored and want to try something different. I like 1911 platform handguns prefer 70 series colts. I will trade even up for a 
colt AR-15 sp-1 with forward assist . Smiths are also a passion of mine and really only interested in 4 model glocks, g-17 desert storm commerative , g26, g27 and g20-10 mil hunter with 6 inch hunting barrel.  Let me know what you have we can go cash+firearm or firearm of equal value or straight up cash.
This item is available for FTF. transaction with written receipt and wisconsin DL#. Out of state buyers this transaction can only be done through a Registered FFL holder at your expence.
Thank-you"

It has Stewart Arms engraved on the side and I assume that they put the bull barrel, compensator and red dot scope on it. I've only shot a few rounds thru it. I would rather have a plain jane gun without the scope. It might be good for hunting with the red dot. I'm not sure if the compensator could be argued to add the inch needed to be legal tho.

The gun has some wear on the blueing and the scope is mounted by screws on the dust cover. I have 3 mags for it for sure but I thought I had 4. It has a luepold Gilmore red dot on it. the dot isn't bright, I'll see if I cant get a new battery for it. It has a nice crisp trigger on it, better than my other 1911's. you can email lovethenubs at g mail dot com.

It has the triangular 5R heavy varmint barrel. I bought this for my wife to hunt with and she has lost all interest in hunting so here it is. Only 15-20 rounds thru it and it is in perfect shape. There is a MINOR, and I do mean MINOR, smudge on the bottom of the stock due to having had a harris bipod mounted on it. I have mounted a super clear Nikon 2.5x10 Bullet Drop Compensating scope, which sells for $400 plus shipping on swfa.com and includes a lifetime warranty. The scope is mounted with Burris tactical scope mounts that do not move! Scope is good out to 600 yards with no adjustment!!! This gun is just as good as new and I have way more than 1K invested so my loss is your gain. Also, early remington VTR's had some reported accuracy issues which were resolved with the new 5R barrel which this one has. Gun will shot 1/2 MOA easily with an amature shooter like myself. Note** my scope cover DOES NOT go with the gun!!!! CASH talks loud and clear to me so...... Thanks and GOD bless!"

  I would like to trade my Ruger P85. I knew the original owner that bought it new in 89 and I bought it from him. It probably has less than 100 rounds down the barrel. It is really a nice gun and is in great shape! I would like to trade for a compact or subcompact handgun. Looking at maybe an M&P compact, or springfield subcompact. .40, 9mm, .45, .357, or 380.

I found something i want but guy needs cash so i lowered price this is a steal ----------->FIRST ""G"" TAKES IT HOME !



AMT Automag III .30 CARBINE semi-auto stainless steel hunter Automag Kit.
I am the original owner of this handgun i purchased it in 1981-82 and have fired it around 200 cartridges to zero scope and millet adjustable target sites.
I cannot find any cosmetic issues it really shows like new being kept in its case nearly 30 years.
The original scope was a weaver 2x but it sports a bushnell troghy 
multi-dot / cross hair optic. the scope mount is detachable letting you bring the .30 carb back to a non-scoped version in a minute while the scope mount is factory fitted never looses its adjustment when re-installed. This firearm has never malfunctioned and while at the range you need to keep everything of value behind the muzzle as it is really a 2ft. flame thrower using winchester hp's. Very accurate well beyond 100 yards with muzzle energy , ft. pounds and velocity exceeding that of a .357 magnum using optimum hunting loads available from wisconsin cartridge co. 
This package deal also comes with a U.S.A. MADE SHOULDER HOLSTER and spare magazine case with bullet loops. 
I really am not in a hurry to part with this AUTOMAG just seeing what trades might be out there. 
I am just kinda bored and want to try something different. I like 1911 platform handguns prefer 70 series colts. I will trade even up for a 
colt AR-15 sp-1 with forward assist . 
Smiths are also a passion of mine and really only interested in 4 model glocks, g-17 desert storm commerative , g26, g27 and g20-10 mil hunter with 6 inch hunting barrel. Let me know what you have we can go cash+firearm or firearm of equal value or straight up cash.
This item is available for FTF. transaction with written receipt and wisconsin DL#. Out of state buyers this transaction can only be done through a Registered FFL holder at your expence.
Thank-you"

Kel-Tec P-3ATHC (Hard Chrome Finish) semi auto pocket pistol chambered in .380ACP. 

The P-3ATHC is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed Kel-Tec's P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. 

The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 

The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

It was originally used as a weapon to finish off whales after they were harpooned by Norwegian whaling vessels. Around the turn of the century every Norwegian ship had one on board. 

It fires six 4-Bore exploding tip cartridges, loaded in the Tommy Gun-like cylinder on the top. 

As you can see from the pics, it was not meant to be fired by hand, but rather mounted to the side of a ship. 

Not sure what its worth, and I wouldn't fire it anymore, although I do have two original shells for it. Selling because I need a new hunting dog more than I need this thing.

There's no telling how many unfortunate whales this gun has sent to the big pond in the sky, but one thing is certain. There's ain't an animal that walks this planet or swims in the ocean that this weapon can't bring down. 

In that classic movie, The Last Dinosaur (1977), Boone should have brought along one of these."

This is an Italian “Pietro Beretta” M92F PACKAGE DEAL!!! Date Code is “AP” (1986 Mfg.) This is from a rare batch of M9’s Beretta made that had most of the features of the M92FS before the M92FS was even released. The most notable features are the pivoting firing pin, de-cocking lever and a chromed bore (Features the strsight dust cover, NOT angled). Also features 2 dot white sights that glow with light absorbtion.

I value the weapon itself at about $490. It has had exactly 864 rounds through it by me (I am second owner). 64 of those were +P rated and the rest were normal FMJ range ammo. Aside from minor scratches around the barrel and slide, it is in great shooting condition. Clean and bright bore and plenty of life left.

I am including 3 Parkerized Pietro Beretta 15 Round magazines (one is sanded down to bare metal), 2 Check Mate 15 Round Magazines and a 30 Round Pro-Mag which surprisingly works well. Only problem is the tendency to not lock the slide sometimes. I will also include a Blackhawk SERPA Holster and 100 rounds of Winchester White Box 124gr. FMJ.

Gun comes in factory case with wood grips and a pair of Rubber Hogue Grips that I shaved down a bit with a razor. Also a no brand tan IWB holster.

My cash price would be $650 for the whole package:
$490 = Gun, Wood Grips, Case
$10 = Hogue Grips
$30 = Winchester Ammo
$40 = Factory Magazines
$20 = Check Mate Magazines
$10 = 30 rd. Pro-Mag
$40 = SERPA Holster + Paddle Option
$10 = Tan Cow hide IWB Holster
AND a dual mag pouch by ASA for free!

I am willing to trade it for an 870 Express or Police (with factory 7 round tube and cylinder bore) AND/OR a Surefire 618LM Weaponlight to go on one! Otherwise, cash."

The Stoeger Double Defense is a side-by-side tactical shotgun chambered for 12 gauge and gauge. The Double Defense, like most double barrel shotguns, is easy to use and has a simple design. Just break open the barrel, slide in the shells, snap it shut--it’s ready to go. Stoeger, however, built the Double Defense specifically for home defense by adding several functional and aesthetic features such as a safety on the tang, or where action hand’s thumb naturally falls. It uses a single trigger for both barrels. It has a green fiber optic front sight that’s easy to see with limited light. But it also has two Picatinny rails: one up top to mount a speed sight or red dot sight, and one below for a light or laser. However, unlike many tactical weapons it has a matte black wooden stock as opposed to synthetic. And, the barrel is matte blue too.

Stoeger’s Double Defense Shotgun—Ready When Trouble Calls! 

Stoeger’s Double Defense side-by-side shot gun is a straightforward, rugged and reliable home defense shotgun. Ideal for use in tight quarters and tense situations, the Stoeger Double Defense with its traditional break-action and short, efficient design is easy to load and quick to deploy in an emergency.

A double-barrel shotgun has been the defensive firearm of choice for generations, but Stoeger has added practical, up-to-date features to the “tried-and-true” double gun. The Double Defense is chambered for 2-3/4- and 3-inch shells, in either 12- or 20-gauge. The tactical-length 20-inch ported barrels feature fixed, improved cylinder chokes. The fast, single-trigger design and convenient, tang-mounted automatic safety makes the Stoeger Double Defense ideal for home security use.

The Double Defense gun is outfitted with a green, fiber-optic front sight and comes standard with two Picatinny Rail accessory mounts: one on the receiver for red-dot sights and a second factory-installed rail under the barrels for attaching targeting lasers or tactical lights. All metal surfaces are finished in matte blue and come complete with non-reflective matte black hardwood stock and forearm.

It just turned 39,000 miles and has been garage kept since bought new. It is Yellow and has a 3"" Sky Jacker lift kit. It has never been taken off road. The 4 wheel drive has only been used during the winter, on a few occasions. I have changed the oil every 3,000 miles or every 6 months as sometimes I did not put 3,000 miles on it in a 6 month period. I have always ran premium synthetic oil in it.

Here is a list of how it is equipped...

- Hard Doors

- Glass Windows

- Vinyl top - in excellent condition

- AM/FM CD player

- 5 speed/4.0-liter Power Tech inline 6 cylinder engine

- Alcoa Aluminum wheels

- Front and rear brush guards

- Reese Hitch (not for towing - used for a luggage rack)

- Interior is flawless

- Nerf bars (to assist getting in/out)

Kelley Blue Book says the Jeep is worth $13,000.00 for excellent condition. My bank says the loan value is $13,000.00. Local car dealer offered $10,300.00 in a trade in. Of course he low balled me because he will put the Jeep on his lot for $13,900.00 or something like that.

Neither the bank or Kelley Blue Book has an option to value the lift kit. So, the prices above are not taking in consideration the lift kit.

I have had this gun for a while now and used it for concealed carry. It does have slight wear from regular carry but nothing out of the ordinary you would not expect. The only reason I am looking to sell or trade is it is just a little to large for me and I am looking for something just a bit smaller. Specifically I am looking for a Kel-Tec PF-9. If you wish to trade I would be looking for $200-$250 depending what you have as well as the gun, please remember that a new PF-9 can easily be had for $230. 

I am currently in Athens, OH attending school and the firearm is in my safe at home in Cincinnati, OH. I often travel back and forth and can do so on any given weekend given enough notice. However, I would not likely be able to meet outside of either Cincinnati or Athens or along the route to and from on Rt. 32. Also for that reason I am unable to share pictures of the gun. Please email me with any questions or text me at REDACTED, please no phone calls as I often cannot immediately answer.

Very Nice. Used very few times.

Handsome and Accurate, for 20 Years and Counting. Ruger® M77® Mark II Target rifles are time-tested, bolt-action, special-application rifles at a great value. These rifles feature a matte stainless steel finish that resists corrosion. The heavy contour, hammer-forged barrel with target crown provides long-range accuracy shot after shot. The wide, target forend gives stability on sandbags or other support surfaces. Its greatest value comes from the features that have defined the M77 Mark II family of rifles for the last 20 years.

With a one-piece bolt that has proven to be one of the strongest on the market, integral scope bases which can never shoot loose, and a diagonally angled forend screw that adds accuracy by securely pulling the barreled action down into the handsome, black laminate stock for accurate shooting, the M77 Mark II Target rifle proves its value as a workhorse in the field and at the range.

Leufold Scope Included. Softcase Included. 

UNIQUE TWO-STAGE TARGET TRIGGER featuring a short ""take-up"" stage, followed by a crisp, light target pull with no creep or overtravel. 

NON-ROTATING, MAUSER-TYPE CONTROLLED ROUND FEED EXTRACTOR is the most positive case extraction system ever invented, and features a fixed blade-type ejector that positively ejects the empty cases as the bolt is moved fully rearward.

HINGED SOLID-STEEL FLOORPLATE for easy unloading without having to chamber each cartridge and a patented latch that is flush with the trigger guard to avoid accidental dumping of cartridges.

THREE-POSITION SAFETY is easily accessible and allows the shooter to lock the bolt or to load and unload the rifle
with the safety engaged.

PATENTED INTEGRAL SCOPE MOUNTS, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver provide a stable mounting
surface for scope rings, eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field (scope rings included FREE).

I am asking for only $375.00 with scope included. Compare to $990 paid for the rifle new and $400plus for the Leupold VX-3 Rifle Scope.
