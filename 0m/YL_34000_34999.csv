We came up with this design for a custom order, where the customer specifically wanted to be able to tuck his shirt in easier than with most tuck holsters.  The end result, a very compact and concealable holster that allows for extreme ability to tuck in even the baggiest of clothing.  

The one shown below is for a Ruger LCP. Color is Chocolate Cherry with gun metal accents, and high gloss/ protection.  

Night Wing is proud to announce that is is now 100% environmental friendly, using only Eco-Flo dyes and natural substances to dye, gloss and work leather.  After several comments of people requesting a natural alternative to typical leather dyes and all the chemicals that can rub up on skin when wearing a holster (even after the leather is sealed), we sought a good alternative.  You ask, we listen.  All natural dyes have been stress tested by our shop to ensure there was no loss of quality.

This is a gun that will stop anything and is extremely accurate.  FIRM on asking price of $725  Compare to prices listed for the same gun on other gun listing sites.  

Ruger's Super Redhawk revolver has been around for about eighteen years now, and enjoys a reputation for strength, durability, and accuracy in a double-action sixgun. Now, Ruger has taken that excellent design, chopped five inches off the barrel, added a very comfortable Hogue grip, and turned the Super Redhawk into a relatively handy little big bore belt gun that they call the ""Alaskan"". Chambered at first for the healthy .454 Casull cartridge.  The .454 Casull will also fire the .45 Colt cartridge interchangeably, making it a very versatile chambering.

While the Alaskan is still a big sixgun, it is much more packable than its full-sized brother. The Alaskan wears a barrel that measures just 2.58 inches, which really dramatically changes the balance and handling qualities of the design. 

The Alaskan was built to be the ultimate back-up gun for those who hike, fish, camp, or hunt in big bear country, hence the name ""Alaskan"". As a heavy-duty self defense gun against large beasts, the Alaskan makes good sense. 


The Super Redhawk design is a very strong and rugged one, with front and rear cylinder lockup, offset cylinder bolt notches, and a solid frame design. It can handle a steady diet of .454 Casull ammunition without shooting loose. The .454 Casull cartridge offers plenty of power and deep penetration with the right choice of ammo. While the .454 will drive relatively lightweight bullets to high velocities with flat trajectories, the heavy weight bullets better fulfill the role intended for the Alaskan. 

The ability of the gun to fire heavy, bone-breaking bullets from a compact, portable package is what the Alaskan is all about. While it could serve well as a primary hunting weapon, in many places it would be illegal for big game hunting due to its short barrel length.  However, there is no barrel restriction on self defense, whether it be for protection from wild animals or felonious thugs. 

The Alaskan carries six rounds of .454 power in the smallest package on the market. It weighs in at just 43.2 ounces, making it almost a pound lighter than the S&W 500 with its three inch barrel plus one inch of compensator. The Alaskan is one-half pound lighter than the Taurus two and one-quarter inch .454 Casull. 

As was expected, recoil is stiff with the heaviest loads, but the grip on the Alaskan was designed especially for this gun, and does a superb job of protecting the shooter's hand. The gun does not ""bite"" the hand at all, even in the web between the thumb and forefinger. It is not painful to shoot. 

The barrel on this Alaskan has one of the smoothest interiors of any handgun barrel that I have ever seen from Ruger, and fouling was not a problem at all. The chambers were also well-finished. All cases extracted easily, even from the heaviest loads tested.  Accuracy was very good with the Alaskan. I could keep six rounds inside of two inches at twenty-five yards, resting my wrists over a rail. The short sight radius made it harder to hit than with a longer barrel, but with the Mt. Baldy bullets loaded over Trail Boss, I could get the gun to group into one and three-quarters inches at twenty-five yards.  If you are standing in the path of a large bear, wild boar, or even a mean bull, that is much more accuracy than you can use.
While the Super Redhawk has always been a strong but somewhat bulky revolver, The Alaskan is in a whole different category. It balances power with portability, strength with handiness, and puts bone-crushing penetration into a very packable sixgun. I like it. - Jeff Quinn"

You are welcome to make offers, but I am not money trouble and I will not give them away.  I am very meticulous with my guns and I take very good care of them.  They are nice guns.

I picked this up on 5/7 and have never put a round down it. All I did was to clean all of the packing grease Taurus slathers on for shipping from it and lube it with some quality Slipstream lube.  Got it home and realized I overextended myself on the credit card.  It was marked $642.95 and I paid more than that out the door, but you can take it off my hands for $600.  It has really nice walnut grips that are a combination of European stipple and American checkered blended from corner to corner with a Taurus Bull Head logo in the center, very nice looking.  Also comes with the stock black plastic grips if that is more to your liking. 2 blued 8 round mags with bumper pads, blushing wrench, cleaning rod and keys to the Taurus safety system lock included as well. Like I said its brand new. Slide action is very smooth.

It's a Utility Rifle! Think Jeeps...

The Stevens 200 is a utility rifle. It is the Jeep of the bolt action world.  If you want cute, you can buy any number of pretty, shiny or gold plated rifles that will have the urban gun club crowd oohing and ahhing. Those guys sure love pretty guns. Mine was not purchased to put on display, so the argument about it being ugly or made for beginners doesn't wash - not even a little.

The Stevens 200 is inexpensive because it does not have the bling that you see on many of today's guns. That's good because most hunters don't need it. You're better off putting the money saved into a great scope or upgrading the trigger. If you remember nothing else, remember that last sentence."

This is an awesome gun. I have had it for several years and it shoots great. There is nothing wrong with this gun other than a small crack in the stock that has been professionally repaired and in no way effects the shooting of the gun. It is just cosmetic, I just wanted to be sure to mention it so there would be no suprises. It is a Bolt action that functions flawlessly. It loads in a tubular magazine under the barrel, not in a clip like the older savage bolt 12 gauges. You will definitely have some curious looks at your next skeet shoot. Yes, I have used it for skeet shooting. I even got to where I could chamber another one and get 2 clays. It is really a fun gun that you don't see that often. I think it is from the 1950's or so, but I don't know for sure. I am having some issues with my camera, so no pics right this second, but I will try to get some up in the next few days. You are more than welcome to give me a call, text, (at REDACTED) or email and I can meet you to take a look at it. This is a good chance to pick up a fun gun that you don't see that often or even pick up that cheap home defense gun you can stand behind the door or something.

I was planning on keeping this one, but I need money to keep some AR stuff going, so here's what I have;



This is a Uberti 1858 Remington, with a 5 1/2"" barrel, and a Kirst Konverter in 45 Colt, with a spare cylinder. 



Great for CAS, as it reloads in less than half the time it takes to eject and reload a Colt SAA/Ruger type pistol. Think of it as a speed loader. Shoot your 5 shots (SASS requires an empty chamber), drop out the cylinder, slip the ring on the next cylinder, and slide it in. Now shoot again! Fast, clean, and cool! 



Also just fun to shoot, and really cool. Tight groups, shoots POA. Crisp, light trigger. Very balanced, feels great in your hand. This is a Uberti, not the cheap metal Pietta.


A word about Kirst Konverters;

I have had both these (several), and two R&Ds, and although they are both very well made, out of high quality materials, the Kirst is just simpler, and quicker to use. It is a five shot cylinder, with a small dedicated spot to drop your hammer down on for a safe means to carry it fully loaded.



Out of money to buy/reload some 45 Colt? Drop in the black powder cylinder, and have at it!



Looking for $550. I have over $350 in the converter, and spare cylinder, and over $300 in the gun. I bought it all new. Low miles! Much prettier than in the pictures.

I'd also trade for a 12"", light weight YHM free float handguard + cash, or a 16"", complete flat top 9mm AR upper, new or like new.

Thanks!!!

Lets you have a much better shooting position.  Crimson Grip is brand new and the LCP is about three months old.  The two extra magazines cost me $28.00 ea and the grips cost me 12.50 each so you can see you are getting a good deal.  No trades needed.  Hands to big for this pistol or I wouldn't sell it.  Cash, M.O. would take a check but you have to wait until check clears before I will release pistol.

I have two original Ruger 5 rd. mags as well as two 30 rd. mags.  I may be able to dig up some rounds for it as well but never got the chance to dig around. The rifle is at my stepmother's house about an hour and a half aways so please, only serious inquiries. I will go pick it up for a serious buyer to look it over. Pic's were taken with my phone so they aren't the greatest but as I said, this weapon is in brand new condition.
Also has a Burris 3X-9X scope. The price includes everything, plus whatever rounds I find and I'm sure there are at least a box or two. I feel the price is fair since this is not an easy weapon to find, even new, at the moment. People are buying them quicker than the stores can re-stock.

Note: We will be selling a few other rifles as well as other sporting goods and knives. My father only purchased the finest items and those that are not sentimental to the family will be available. Some would call him excentric; he collected everything from spears and swords to regular camping gear. Let me know if there's something ""odd"" you've been looking for!"

I was told it is factory, but I don't know enough about these to say for sure. It also has a compass in in the stock.
The finish is perfect as is the bore.  
The neatest part of this rifle is the flip up scope mount.  It is a Pachmayr model 721 scope mount that flips up allowing the shooter use of the iron sites.  I currently have a Revelation 6X scope mounted on the rifle.  The optics are clear and the crosshairs are sharp.

I also have over 100 rounds of ammo to go along with this.  It is a mixed lot of soft point, hollow point and full metal jacket ammo.

HERE IS SOME INFO ON .357 SIG

Developed in 1994, the new cartridge was named ""357"" to highlight its purpose: to duplicate the performance of 125-grain (8.1 g) .357 Magnum loads fired from 4-inch (100 mm) barreled revolvers, in a cartridge designed to be used in a semi-automatic pistol. Performance is similar to the 9x23mm Winchester.

The .357 SIG provided a self-defense cartridge close in performance to a 125 gr .357 Magnum, but from a smaller and more concealable semi-automatic pistol.

The .357 SIG was the first modern bottleneck commercial handgun cartridge since the early 1960s, when Remington introduced the unsuccessful .22 Remington Jet (1961), which necked a .357 Magnum case down to a .22 caliber bullet, and the .221 Remington Fireball (1963). Soon after the .357 SIG, other bottleneck commercial handgun cartridges appeared: the .400 Corbon (1996), necking the .45 ACP down to .40 caliber; the .440 Corbon (1998), necking down the .50 AE to .44 caliber, the .25 NAA (1999), necking the .32 ACP down to .25 caliber; and the .32 NAA (2002), necking the .380 ACP down to .32 caliber.

I like having all metal on an all metal gun. This deal includes TWO factory replacement recoil springs and guide rods, as well as the stainless steel)
