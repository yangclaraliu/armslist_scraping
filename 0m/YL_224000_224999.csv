Less than 150 rounds through the GLOCK I sold so I don't need any of these items any longer.

The balance of the 150 rounds were shot through the Plus 2 mags for reliability check.  One of the Plus two's has ""X's"" on it since a friend gave it to me when he had problems installing the Plus 2.  He had the spring incorrectly installed.  It was an easy fix and it ran flawlessly after I positioned the spring correctly.  I will sell that one for $20 since it does have the markings on it in black marker.

Technically, the Star 30M is an updated version of the earlier Star 28M pistol. Star 30M is a recoil operated, locked breech pistol, that uses Browning-designed, linkless locking (High Power-type), with two lugs on the barrel and shaped cam under the chamber that interacts with slide stop axis inside the frame.
Star 30M features double action trigger with slide mounted ambidextrous safety that locks firing ping only, leaving trigger and hammer unaffected in ""safety on"" position, thus allowing the gun to be ""dry fired"". Star 30M also features magazine safety, that disables firing when magazine in not in position. Another safety feature is a loaded chamber indicator. Star 30M features internal slide rails (like the SIG P-210 or CZ-75). The frame and slide are made from steel. The front sight is fixed, the rear sight is dovetailed and thus can be adjusted for windage.

Star 30M is a reliable, accurate pistol. It comes with the original box and manual."

Plastic sites tend to shear off when cycling the slide on weak hand drills, injured officer, etc.
I had custom sites (all steel) installed to combat this weakness. Ameriglo Combat all black rear site, large dot front site (all steel). With the rear site blacked out, the front site really ""jumps"" out at you, making for good, fast shooting. I've become a convert.

The feature that I like the most is that this is a spectacular SHORT little carbine.  I'm sure the barrel is 16"", but it all just feels so good. I find myself grabbing this rather than my AR, many times. Also the ""straight"" stock just like a Winchester, rather than the pistol grip. I am an old-time ""cowboy fan"", though. 10+1 capacity and a sweet shooter with both .357 ro .38's. Recoil is nothing,even with full house .357mag loads. The only thing at all wrong with this rifle is a tiny bit of surface rust on the barrel. Courtesy of a friend :(  Can be easily fixed with 0000 steel wool and some oil. I'm just not messing with it because there is nothing wrong with it, and it'll just happen again. Having a rifle reblued from a ""good"" guy is only like 75.00, if you're a fanatic I used to be, but understand more after leaving the Army.

According to Wikipedia:  The Browning Automatic 5, most often Auto-5 or simply A-5, is a recoil-operated semi-automatic shotgun designed by John Browning. It was the first successful semi-automatic shotgun designed and remained in production until 1998. The name of the shotgun designates that it is an autoloader with a capacity of five shots, four in the magazine and one in the chamber.   

I received this in a trade from somebody who inherited it from his grandfather, so I don't know the history behind this.

I got this thinking that I was going to take up shooting clays, which is something I never got around to.

Or have the barrel shortened and use it for Zoot Shooting matches, which is another shooting activity I don't have time for.

I have never fired this shotgun myself.

It is a five digit serial number in the 82,000 range, with an M above the serial number.   

According to Browning, this was made in 1957.  The ""M"" means ""Standard Weight""

I'll try to get some pictures of those markings when time allows.  

Overall length is 49 inches.

Barrel (from front of ejection port to muzzle) is 29 1/2 inches.

The finish is very worn at the top, bottom, and rear of the receiver, and on a few spots on the barrel.    I'd say about 70% of the finish remains on the receiver.    Inconsistencies in the photos below are due to lighting and the camera's flash (which produces a glaring reflection).

I have not taken it apart to inspect the internal parts.

There is a gouge in left side of the forearm where it meets the receiver. 



 The butt-plate is cracked and missing a large piece.

I have decided to go all Ruger, so non-Rugers (except for heirlooms, and the guns belonging to other family members) in the safe gotta go...

Of all the guns I have ever owned, Rugers have always served me better than any others regarding accuracy, dependability, and just sheer good looks...and Ruger customer service is second to none. Period. That being said, I am doing a ""fire-sale"" of non-Rugers....

Here are some of the guns I have for sale and trade interests are at the bottom. If you are serious about any of these, I will gladly send you pictures. If you are within 30-40 minutes of me, you can set up a time to come look for yourself, but SERIOUS buyers ONLY, PLEASE!!!

1. Bushmaster XM15E (I think) AR; four rail forearm; scope; weapon light with switch; A buttload of magazines (at least 10 - 12) mostly with green followers. Along with this comes a box of AR parts including a Vltor MilSpec tube stock with the AA battery tubes on it, Matech flip-up battle sight, rail covers, rail riser, the original Bushmaster case.
Cash $1,000.00 Trade $1,100.00.
(Trade pending on AR parts....subtract $50.00 if it happens)

2. Kel-Tec PF9 NIB with extra magazine. I put about 30 rounds through it. I just can't get along with the KT trigger...and I have acquired an LC9, so my pocket pistol/BUG role is filled. $225.00 Cash $250.00 Trade

3. SOLD

4. SOLD

5. Hybrid 1911; SA GI lower; Auto Ordnance upper. Small gap between frame and dust cover, but does NOT affect performance.
Cash $500.00 Trade $550.00

6. Taurus model 617; Stainless .357/.38 7 shot with bobbed hammer; DAO; 2"" barrel; LNIB with an HKS speedloader. With the right holster, it would be a nice carry revolver. NO hammer to snag....7 rounds...SS heft so 38spl P has very manageable recoil. $400.00 Cash $425.00 Trade

7. G34 3rd gen with a TON of upgrades; LWD barrel; 3.5 connector; Advantage Tactical sights (with all the spare colors and other parts); Extended slide stop and mag release; ""Punisher"" slide plate; Dawson aluminum magwell. This pistol is the ultimate ESP Glock. Almost like I built it specifically for IDPA, huh??
Cash $550.00 Trade $600.00

These prices are a starting point, and are fair values for the guns as compared to others on this forum and others. I can also sweeten a deal with optics, parts, target stands, etc.....

I can email or text pictures

What I am looking for:
Rugers, of course....

SR40's and SR9's, prefer fullsize, all black finish preferred, or OD/black. LC9 or LCR 38 or 357 with or without laser. NO LCP's please. had one....just too damn little for my big ass paws....
Mini-14's in .223, prefer synthetic stock, stainless upper, or tactical model with collapsible stock/rails. Ruger New Vaquero in 38/357. GP100 stainless 4"".
K77/357 laminate stock. Model 77 in .223 heavy barrel, or 308 heavy barrel. KP345 or other Pseries preferrably in .40 or 45ACP.
And, if the gods are smiling on me, an SR1911......(dreaming, I know....)

You know what.....if it says ""Sturm, Ruger, and Co."" on it.....try me...
EXCEPT for 10/22 or MK type pistols...already have a LOAD of those....

AND I WOULD PREFER FACTORY STOCK RUGERS, PLEASE!!!!
NO OPTICS, PLEASE!!! I will do my own sights and upgrades.
If it is as you bought it, that's okay, too. I can always ""undo"" mods...
Picky, ain't I?!?!?

Cash is always king, since I can go buy Rugers with the cash....

1 for 1 trade examples.....
Hybrid 1911 for Vaquero, or SR9 $$, SR40 $$
G34 for SR1911 or Mini-14
Bushmaster for Mini-14 or M77 and $500 cash, or for mini AND 77....
Bushmaster for Gunsite Scout rifle....(Wow, I must REALLY like Rugers, huh?)
Taurus 617 for LCR357 or SP101 2"" or GP100
PF9 for LCP, or another LC9, SR9, or SR40 with $$ on my side

I would like to stick to the following calibers....
9mm, 40S&W, .357/.38, .223/5.56, .308

The pistol was originally $890 plus tax, the extra mags $30 each, and the holster $95.  The total package is worth $1200 new, so $950 is a bargain.  If you're not interested in the holster, I can knock $50 off the price.  The holster also works well for CCW without the Surefire, but if you're wanting to purchase the Surefire as well we can arrange something.

In most cases I have used the April edition of The Standard Book of Firearms to establish the listed price.  I also try to adjust (up or down) this price by current and prevailing market prices for items in the condition I have listed.  The listed prices are fair but I will consider all REASONABLE offers.  Please be knowledgeable of the general market value of the item before making a counter offer.  In most cases can match most published prices for the same item in the same condition.  However, don't expect to get an In-the-Box, unfired, 20 year old classic rifle for the price it sold for 20 years ago, in most cases that's just not reasonable.

Hello,

I'm looking to sell or trade my very lightly used Winchester 1500 xtr 20 gauge.  It's in 95% condition.  It's been used very little and shoots like a dream.  It cycles everything including light loads.  It has an improved cylinder barrel which is great for hand trap/grouse/even slugs.  Made in the USA!

The P-07 model Is a compact sized handgun, just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty. The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached. When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular In the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted In some available space that was used to Increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds. The results speak for themselves, the flush fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W. The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first Introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for it's owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change.

It has a factory jeweled bolt, has had a professional trigger job w/ the pull weight down to about 3.5 pounds w/ a crisp break. Original H&S Precision kevlar reinforced stock w/ full length aluminum bedding block, and has a Bushnell Elite 3200 3-9x40 mounted in Leupold QRW rings & bases & Harris bipod. Very accurate set-up...shoots sub-MOA all day long w/ good ammo. I have shot exactly 120 rounds thru it since new, and it looks absolutely perfect. There are no finish flaws or scratches, stock is perfect, bore looks like new & is hardly even broken in. 

This would make someone a nice tactical or target rifle & is much-much nicer than the new cheaper Remington 700's.... It weighs a little more than the newer offerings from Remington & has a larger diameter/ heavier barrel, and in my opinion out shoots them all day long. The H&S stock is also a lot more rigid than the new models leading to better shot to shot accuracy.  Also included is the original Remington box, manual, & paperwork.

Carbon fiber laminates were developed for the aerospace industry which required maximum strength to weight ratios, hiqh tensile properties and all weather durability. This combination lends itself to making an especially rugged and light weight knife handle.

The half serrated ATS-34 blades of the SOG JetEdge Knife are surgically sharp. ATS-34 is considered to be a custom, quality stain resistant steel that exhibits excellent edge holding, toughness and hardness.

Unlike any other blade design, the SOG JetEdge Knife showcases new grind lines along with a ""shark tooth tip"" which generates exceptional point strength. SOG's preferred opening slot fits within the contours of the blade and provides quick one hand opening. A scalloped thumb rest increases downward pressure and offers delicate tip control for precision work.

This is a very clean gun and although it does have some minor character marks it is not beat up like some of the guns you see. It also has a very nice piece of wood on it. This gun is similar to the MPR'S made today as it has the rail underneath. It is also equipped with the external sight blocks for mounting a Unertl type scope. It is the 64 action and the sn is 81xx98A. I hate to sell it but am working towards another gun and need the cash... You will be hard pressed to find a nicer one.

Shipping will be actual or FTF in central Ohio.

Asking $350 for the hole lot together, Please do not ask me to seporate it, As I am selling it all together to get it out of my way to do a remodeling project, So it must all go at once, You can keep what you want and sell off the rest if you do not need it, As there is always some one looking to reload...

I will consider trades and partial trades with cash, So let me know what you have and we can go from there, The worst that I can say is no thank you...

Also I prefer that these items be picked up in person, As they are to heavy to ship via USPS mail, And will cost a lot to go thru UPS or FED-X due to the weight, I can and will ship it at the buyers expense if needed, But all Shipping and Handling cost will be the responcibilty of the buying party, And will be needed up front with payment..."

It's been shot twice with surplus ammo (350rds total) and cleaned immediately. I bought the gun new so round count is 350. The only issues are had were ammo related (I had a couple of dud rounds in the Polish ammo, wouldn't shoot in my Tok either) but no other problems.
