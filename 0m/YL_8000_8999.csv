We all know that there are certain things that spouses or significant others should not teach each other or discuss, right? They usually include: driving lessons, politics, wallpapering or painting, and firearms. Why not come out and learn from some easy going, approachable, competent, friendly, and non-testosterone charged instructors?

Learning to handle a pistol is one of the most satisfying, empowering things that you can do.

The instructors of Rochester Personal Defense, LLC have taken the Defensive Firearms Skills Classes 1 and 2 and combined them into Defensive Firearms Shooting Skills 101 Firearms Training

* Firearm safety
* Legalities and justification in self defense (Article 35)
* Deescalation and disengagement from an encounter
* Verbal commands
* Drawing the handgun effectively and safely
* Trigger control and manipulation
* Malfunctions and stoppage clearing
* Tactical vs combat reloading
* Movement and shooting while moving

You will get to practice all of the skills with an unloaded handgun until you are comfortable, then you will get to go live on the range.

Note: This is not a basic level class. If you have never fired or used a handgun before, you should either attend an NRA Basic Pistol class or obtain similar training before attending this class. You must be completely familiar and comfortable with your handgun in order to attend the DPS 101 class. All attendees will be asked to provide verifiable experience. If you have any questions, call before registering.

	   a bolt carrier, disconnector, selector, etc.  The REGISTERED
	   auto-sear IS a machinegun.  Therefore this truely isn't
	   a parts kit but is actually a complete gun.  A Class II
	   manufacturer may assemble these parts with a semi-auto
	   firearm to create a working gun.  If the auto-sear was
	   registered prior to May 19th 1986 this weapon may be owned
	   by the general public.  If it was registered after May
	   19th 1986 it is non transferable and may NOT be owned by
	   civilians.

	2. All parts are unregistered.  This kit contains all the
	   same parts including an auto-sear, but this sear is NOT
	   registered.  ATF does not consider the sear to be a
	   machinegun.  However, if you own this kit AND a semi auto

I have ordered this rifle and should be here by next week. I have decided to go a different route and cut my losses. I got this rifle as close to a real SR-25 as I could. It also takes SR-25 mags.

The upper and lower receivers are DPMS with forward assist and dust cover with a SST Match Kreiger SDM contoured barrel (that means it is a fluted bull barrel all the way up to gas block where it comes out to a heavy barrel, like the SR-25), it also has a PRI adjustable gas block (for when you get a suppressor), Daniel's Defense quad rail, phantom flash suppressor (the picture is basically the same just a little different), JP match trigger and speed hammer (crisp), knights armament rail covers, and more. 

The DPMS SASS rifle is not anywhere close in comparison to this rifle as far as accuracy because of the barrel. With this rifle you will be able to take the sprayer of of a spray can at 600 yards and shoot competitively out to 1100 yards. The SASS rifle is also 3500 with out tax. I am asking 2500 obo for this rifle. If you have any questions please feel free to ask.

I recently inherited this Franchi DU shotgun from a family member that was a gun collector. I obviously am not. That is why I first came to this board for help in finding a value on a gun. After all, that is what a forum is for. I thank the kind few fellows who helped me on both here and arguntrader.com to get an idea what i should sell or trade this for. Since I am a person that does not like being ripped off either, I took this gun to not one, but two reputable gun dealers in the Central Arkansas area. Both of these dealers were kind enough to help me for free. Both of these dealers also concluded that this gun being brand new, never fired, with tags still attached (as were all 3 of the guns I inherited) and only made in 1992 and early 1993, was a collectors item and therefore the smaller local dealer valued it high at 1300 and the larger commercial (GANDER) valued it at a 1000 as a retail re-sale.(Gander also only offered me 500 for the AR i bought there a month before for $1500)  I apologize for misinterpreting what this gun is worth. I have no use for a fancy collectors gun like my grandfather. I use my guns, not collect them. That is why I put it on here to get rid of. I use synthetic stock guns that I can hold underwater,drop, and scratch. So with that being said, this makes five parties to have valued this gun.I guess the price needs to be between 699 and 1300??? I apprecitate the help. I will still trade for synthetic semi autos, decent pistols of this value and a decent O/U."

I have quite a few and this one's low man on the totem pole. Actually it's the only one (SKS) that's at home right now as the rest are up north. I never fired it. It's in really nice shape. Comes as pictured with or without scope depending on the deal.  1953 Tula. This rifle is all matching, the stamped serial numbers on the receiver, action cover, trigger guard, magazine and bolt as well as the etched number on the gas tube are all the same. The stock appears to be an arsenal replacement, as the original serial number is obliterated and the matching number stamped above it. The stock is stamped 1954.  It has a B-SQUARE scope mount with a Simmons ""SKS"" 762 4x28 scope on it.
  Trade up or down plus or minus cash is fine depending on what you have. I am interested in other rifles, shotguns or handguns. I will entertain offers on pretty much anything right now except ""white metal"" guns. Just lookin for something else to play with as I will NEVER shoot this one and it is collecting dust. Some one might as well enjoy it. I would like to keep it FTF in WI right now as it just makes it easier for me but if the deal is right I will ship. I have quite a few references on this site and others that I can provide if needed. Thanks for looking and if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask.  -Goodspeed"

We are now certified to instruct you in the legalities and carrying of a firearm in Utah as well as the other states that honor the Utah Non-Resident Permit. If you travel a lot, the non-resident permits are a big help if you decide to carry or wish to carry where you want to go. Note: the Utah permit is NOT VALID IN NEW YORK STATE.

NOTE: This class will cover ONLY the laws and regulations concerning the State of Utah. We will not be discussing New York State laws or other states' laws.

We will be doing your passport style photos, processing your fingerprints, and we have a notary available. All you have to do is attend, add a copy of your NY drivers license, a check made payable to the Utah BCI for $65.25, and fill everything out and drop your completed application (with your payment) in the mail. We even give you the pre addressed envelope!!

The cost of the permit itself is only $65.20 and it is valid for 5 years. Note: the class fee does not include the cost of the permit.

There are some disqualifiers too. (DWI's within 10 yrs, etc) Please contact us if you have any questions before registering. (We'd hate to have you come attend and be surprised).

I have a Smith and Wesson (Sigma?) SW40VE here that I acquired from a friend who owes me money.  I don't know much about these guns and am just interested in moving it to recover the funds.  

From what I know about him and the way he operates he bought it back in the Clinton Era (as it has the 10 rounds mags) and put a box through it and loaded up one mag and threw it in a nightstand and it hasn't seen the light of day since.

It appears to be in overall very good condition with a few small handling marks on the slide which I couldn't get to show up in my pictures with a crappy camera.

It comes as shown with two 10 round mags and no other accessories.  The serial starts with PBP8xxx.

I would prefer FTF in NWMO for $240 or could ship at an additional cost.  Additional cost if I have to drive a ways to meet you at my discretion

If you have any questions just ask.

Turn it upside down and look under the slide for a dimple to the rear area of the slide. If the pistol has this dimple then use the ML15120 set.

For those of you unfamiliar with the XD pistol, it is a modern semi-automatic pistol that generally considered a very reliable and accurate weapon.

You should do your own due diligence as this is a popular pistol and widely documented on the internet, but here are two links to a torture test and stress test: 
http://springfield-armory.primediaoutdoors.com/SPstory11.php
http://springfield-armory.primediaoutdoors.com/SPstory02.php

I am selling everything below as a complete package:

XD40 pistol
XD gear (holster, magazine loader, two-magazine pouch)
original box (manual, lock, test fired cartridge, test fire date is 10-2008)
5 magazines (2 that came with the pistol, 3 other Springfield factory magazines; two of these are brand new and unused)
an extra two-magazine pouch

Around here you can get an XD40 pistol brand new-in-box with two mags for $499 plus tax.  New factory magazines go for about $25, so for three mags is $75.  Assuming 8% sales tax, that's comes out to about $620 out the door if you were to buy brand new.

I will sell the package for $500 firm.

Other comments: This pistol has had between 500-600 rounds fired through it.  No malfunctions or failures.  It has been cleaned and lubricated as recommended after each range trip, hopefully it shows (see photos and feel welcome to inspect it thoroughly).  The finish is excellent as it has never been holstered and carried; after range trips it is cleaned, wiped down with a silicone cloth, and stored in a dry safe. At least around here, it is still relatively straightforward to find 40 caliber ammunition (not so for 9mm), so that's another plus.

I'd like to keep it, but I have a baby on the way in Oct, and am selling one of my XD40s.

1. I've got a Izhevsk, 1944-dated PU, it's an original with WW2 bolt, mount, base, scope, etc.  It was arsenal refurbed at some point, because it has a like new metal and wood finish, early 1990's Century import with the very small hard to see import mark on the muzzle. Near perfect bore, no counter sinking or anything. The scope number on the barrel shank was buffed off, you can see that it's a little flatter there but they did an awesome job and it's real hard to tell you have to nearly feel it, but it does indicate it was a sniper to begin with. Nice marbled/burled looking hardwood stock on it, and all numbers are matching. This is a very collectible cold war relic. My asking price on this rifle is a VERY conservative $900 cash. For those of you that think this is high for a Nagant, you need to do some research on what you are looking at. PM me or email me with any questions."

This is my Romy G AK47 built on an ITM Arms receiver. It's got PLUM furniture and a Leapers scope on it. This was my wifes ride, but she's only shot 5 rounds through it and I'm tired of moving around it in my safe. The plum furniture was put on the rifle after she fired it, and has never been on a rifle when it was shot. I have the original top cover for the ak and it will come with one 30 round magazine and the original top cover. 
Price is $550 as you see it, or $525 without the scope/scope mount top cover.

It is missing the front site hood, and there is a little screw up on top of the handguard that is missing as well. It has no markings on the receiver besides the serial number (small import mark under barrel), as in no Yugo Crest or anything. All numbers besides the bolt are matching, and all capture screws and cleaning rod are intact. It comes with 70 rounds of Turkish 8mm on stripper clips in a bandoleer, and the leather sling.

Finish is in about 85%+, all spring loaded clips are still spring loaded, and nothing falls off under recoil. Ive put 70 rounds though this one (all Turkish) and the previous owner shot an estimated 300 rounds through it. The bolt face still looks good (no major pitting), and the bore is in excellent condition.

I'm asking $180 OBO, and am willing to deliver anywhere within Indiana for the cost of fuel (23 MPG). Otherwise id like to stay within 30 minutes of Pittsboro. I am trying to fund another purchase so id rather not trade unless you have a Savage 99 in 308, or Kel-tec SUB2000 in 9mm (Glock mag variant).

This unit has been fired less than 200 rounds. Following is a 
list of the quality components used. CORE LITE SYNTHETIC STOCK, CHEEK REST, HARRIS BI POD, TIMMENY ADJUSTABLE TRIGGER, WOLF SPRING KIT, TITANIUM FIRING PIN, ADAMS AND BENNETT STAINLESS HEAVY FLUTED BARRELL, BERSKA 6.5-25X50 POWER SCOPE (built on sunshade)), UNIT IS FINISHED WITH DURA COAT ALSO KNOWN AS STEALTH COAT. THE ACTION IS CZ BURNO 98 LARGE RING (a variant of the K98 mauser built for nazi germany) THE CHECK MADE CZ BURNO WAS MADE IN CHECKELZAVAKIAN MAUSER PLANT STILL MADE WITH GOOD QUALITY GERMAN STEEL. THE HANDLE WAS CUT, HEATED, AND BENT BY PRO GUNSMITH TO ALLOW FOR A SCOPE. THE SCOPE MOUNT IS A REDFIELD STEEL BASE WITH REDFIELD SCOPE RINGS. BARSKA AO VARMINT RIFLESCOPE IS CLEAR AND GOOD IN LOW LIGHT.


This firearm is in great condition, functions correctly, bipod is adjustable for 2 height positions and works great. There is a couple of small spots where the camo is scraped on the SS barrel but not very noticeable. It is capable of consistent 800 yard shots and should last a lifetime. One of a kind is probably not accurate, but I believe one would have to look hard for a mate. I will include 100 rounds of match grade ammo. I will be in 
Ohio the 1st or 2nd week of October and can deliver this unit then. Price is $1800.00 or call me at REDACTED to discuss options. I may agree to partial trade for other firearms or, make an offer."
