I’ve seen these at gun shows loaded into 12 gage shells in sabots. BUT legally speaking I’m not recommending that you load these or try to weaponize them. They represent the ultimate military weapon and a unique historical item. Great conversation piece.  I’m selling these flechettes as a piece of historic militaria only. Flechette ammo is illegal in some places, like Florida, so know your local laws. So Far as I know Flechettes are 100% legal to own everywhere until you reload them into shells or fire them out of an air rifle because until then they are just nails with wings. But I’m not a lawyer.
Here is a link to more info:

This is the military projectile that was so deadly the U.S. thought it might be against the Geneva Convention! In the 1960s the U.S. Army began early developmental work on flechette weapons. The thought was to fire these wicked steel darts and cause massive casualties among the enemy.

Flechettes are 1"" long, hardened-steel darts with fins, and number approximately 950 darts per pound. (so there are 1900 +/- here) There were experimental flechette rounds used in Vietnam for the M203 grenade launcher and the 12 gauge shotgun.

These rounds had tremendous military advantages, as they were lighter than standard rounds, had much lower recoil, had considerable range, and could penetrate body armor. A very high velocity, small diameter projectile easily penetrates body armor.

These flechettes were used in the Vietnam-era M546 APERS-T 105mm artillery shell, known to Vietnam vets as “The Beehive.” This devastating round was designed after the Korean War as a way to stop the human wave assault tactics used by the Chinese in that war. At a distance of 75 meters the Beehive shell detonates and sends 8,000 of these steel darts screaming downrange towards the enemy. Each steel flechette is roughly an inch long and weighs 8 grains or so, and upon impact they bend into a hook shape, with the finned tail section often breaking off to start a second wound channel. At close range the high velocity of the flechettes made the M546 extremely lethal; it was described as the world's largest shotgun round. Legend has it that after the Beehives were used to repulse an attack, the enemy dead were often found in the field of fire with their hands nailed down to the wooden stocks of their rifles."

$525.00 last price reduction before it goes back in the safe or up for auction.

  This would have been one of the first years that Winchester resumed manufacturing after the war effort. Rifling is in great condition and it is still a very accurate gun. Wood has aged nicely and the bluing is now what you would call a browning, lol. Very nice collectible or use it as a reasonbly priced gun for cowboy action shooting. Or just have fun and shoot the heck out of it. That's what it was made for. I have almost 2 boxes of ammo for the gun that I will include. (1 round fired for functionality) lol.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are a effing retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."

The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal Silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

The ACOG that is on it, may not go with the trade, as i cannot guarantee the authenticity of it, since I do not have the box or papers with it, but it does function as it should, has the correct ACOG recticle, and the green light source strip on top does pull light into the recticle on it.

The weapon is in great shape, come with a factory SIG black hard plastic case.

Firearms Return Policy: 
VERY IMPORTANT - Please take your time to inspect all firearms thoroughly before proceeding with the firearms transfer process. Once a new firearm is transferred to you it is considered used, even if unfired. Consequently, we cannot provide a full refund for new firearms once they have been transferred into your possession. Also, we DO NOT reimburse FFL transfer fees on cancelled or refused firearms. We do understand that some manufacturer defects may not be identifiable upon initial inspection. However, upon discovering a defect after the transfer, the firearm must be returned directly to the manufacturer for replacement or repair (in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty policy). By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

 The Green Laser has a super long range with windage and elevation adjustments along with a pressure sensitive switch that is mounted to the Vertical Grip which has a built-in super bright flashlight/strobe light.
Listing includes everything listed above along with two additional magazines (20rd) and 100 rounds of ammo to help you sight it in. The gunbroker sighted in the rear flip-up sight and I adjusted the Reflex Sight and Laser Sight as close as I could to the iron sights. This rifle and all of the accessories are brand new. We purchased this as a home defense weapon  but decided it would be better to have something with us at all times so we would like to sell this rifle or do a partial trade on one or two quality small CCW style pistols such as a Glock 19 or other, Sig P938, Kimber 3"" with Crimson Trace, etc. Just let me know what you have. I have over $2450 invested in everything that goes with it and I am asking $2250 for everything. Price is negotiable if you dont want certian items listed. As we all know everything is going for higher because the demand, for example the Sig M400 that sold at Wal Mart for $897 is going for over $1800 without anything but a red dot. The msrp was much higher on this rifle and I did pay a preminum over that plus all the accessories because I dont see the prices going back to normal with these types of guns setting on a local shelf anytime soon. The nice thing with this setup is that you dont have to track down all the pieces, I've already done all of that, lol. The main reason I chose the Anderson AR is because of its special R85 coating. I dont mind oiling a gun but you dont have to oil this gun....ever. That is a nice feature for one that you just want to set aside incase of an emergency, you dont have to worry about getting it out to clean it...its ready to go whenever you need it. Great for home defense, target shooting, hunting, etc the sights have the settings to set it up for what you want to do with it. 

The feature that sets the Anderson AM15 Rifles apart from the masses is the proprietary RF85 TREATMENT allowing Anderson weapon systems to operate efficiently 
without traditional wet lubricant. In a coefficient friction test performed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the reduction of friction on all steel surfaces 
was reduced by 85% -- without traditional wet lubricant, hence the name RF85. An RF-85 treated weapon cycles faster and more reliably, operates at cooler temperatures, 
experiences significantly less wear and, without traditional wet lubricant, doesn't experience failures due to excess dirt and carbon fouling in the action.According to the Oak Ridge 
Testing Report, There are several advantages associated with friction reduction in general, two of those being heat reduction and increased component life.
Another huge advantage offered by the RF-85 Treatment is incredibly easy cleanup and dramatically reduced carbon fouling. 

With the Anderson AM-15 RIFLE treated with the RF85 process, the gun never needs to be cleaned with cleaning solution – only wiped out with a moist cloth and then dry cloth. 
Repeat - the action of this weapon never needs to be cleaned in the traditional manner with harsh, smelly solvents and should never be oiled. Simply clean with soapy water and 
a nylon brush, followed by thorough drying with a clean cloth. DO NOT OIL.

Rifle Specs are as follows: 
Chambered in 5.56
Overall Length: 32 1/2"" Inches
Full length Picatinny Rail
Open Front Sight
The rifiling is a 1:8 twist
Mil-spec 7075-76 receiver
Stock weight without magazines is 6.3 lbs

Magpul MOE grip and 6 position adjustable butt stock

If you have any questions or would like to see more pictures just let me know. The dual 30rd Pmags & Maglink shown in the rifle are NOT included however like I mentioned I am including (1) 30rd Pmag that is brand new in the package. I would rather sale/trade face to face however I am willing to ship to legal states, buyer would be responsible for shipping charges and rifle will need to be shipped to your local ffl. I can accept Paypal or Credit Cards for an additional 3% charge...I am an individual not a dealer.

If it doesn't sell by Sat Feb 2nd I am going to put it on Gunbroker so we can get our pistols, don't pass this deal up. With this you are getting a solid rifle with the necessary accessories ready to go without having to deal with a bunch of paperwork or paying any extra fees or taxes.

Black Rain AR15's are the finest quality custom hand made (in the USA) semi-auto AR rifles, you definitely get what you pay for as their products are top of the line!  This is a brand new and unfired rifle and it's their PG5 model.

If you want to learn about these top of the line AR rifles see and or call your local gun shop and or go to BRO's website www.blackrainordnance.com.  I purchased this gun a couple months ago from the Shooter Shop in West Allis, WI and paid just under $2,500.00..

Black Rain AR's include a beautiful soft case, manual, sling and one 30 round PMag magazine.

If you're looking for an AR15 stop looking and buy this one, you will NEVER loose money.  Compare a Black Rain Ordnance rifle to any of the other less expensive and way over priced brands and you will agree, Black Rain Ordnance products are significantly better quality than a Bushmaster, Colt, Rock River Arms (RRA), DPMS, Stag, Smith & Wesson, Ruger, CMMG, Olympic, Remington, Winchester, Mossberg or Sig Sauer.

$2,450.00 or best offer.  I will only sell face to face to another Wisconsin resident or I will ship to your FFL at the buyers expense.  I will provide a bill of sale and I will only accept payment in cash or USPO money order, I'm NOT INTERESTED IN TRADING ANYTHING.

Well maintained, probably about 500 rounds fired through it, so it has the typical signs of being broken-in.  Always cleaned & lubricated, barrel is clean and shiny & I'm happy to take it apart & show you at a nearby FFL if you live local.  

I got it over a year ago thinking it would be fun to have a plinker and something non-intimidating for beginners / girls / kids to fire at the range, but nowadays all I do is shoot skeet and if I'm taking anyone to the range with me who needs to start on a .22 I can rent one off the wall for free.

Its fun to shoot, if I didn't live in the city I'd keep it to shoot cans in my backyard for practice, but I barely even shoot my larger-caliber pistols (thank goodness for my bank account) and I only keep those for self defense purposes, so I've run out of reasons to keep my GSG.  

I'm not really comfortable going less than 300 even though its used, at that point I might as well keep it.  So, if you want to save yourself $75 from what you'd pay at a dealer for a gun that works exactly the same, feel free to contact me.

Please note that this is a CA legal model so the barrel is not threaded.

I'm happy to meet at an FFL anywhere in the LA area, or ship it off, buyer pays shipping & transfer fees.  For out of state I'd prefer to do payment via paypal.  Please make sure this firearm is compliant with your local laws.

This is a 1981 manufactured Colt Combat Commander with the RARE Satin Nickel finish. This Colt is in Very Good Plus condition with a few blemishes as shown in the photos. Please keep in mind the high resolution photos show blems worse then they actually are, in some cases the photo will show a blemish on the gun that you cannot see by the naked eye. More often then not, my feed-backs will say ""Item better than in the photos"". I do not know the actual round count. I have put maybe 50 rounds through it. She sets in the safe more then she visits the range. The bore is in excellent condition. I do not have the original box or manual. What you see is what you get, (1) original mag along with the original Colt Pachmayr wrap around grips. I took off the wrap around grips and put on the Colt double diamond grips, which are also included in the sale. Please review the photo slideshow and email me at REDACTED with any questions.

Brand New AR-15 upper half in the 5.56/223 caliber. This is is a complete rifle. The barrel is 16"" M4 profile with the 1-7 twist. The receiver on the upper half is made from the durable 7075 forging which is mil-spec. The rail system on this upper is a free float 10"" modular rail system which allows the shooter to move the rails where it best suits their needs and makes it easier to grip with the smaller diameter. 

These rifles have been modified so that they will fire the military ammo flawlessly or whatever you may decide to feed it. This upper is extremely heavy duty. 
The upper was built by Precision Arms International in Alabama.
The lower is extremely heavy duty also being a complete Rock River Arms lower with a 6 position stock. 

I have two of these rifles and they have consecutive serial numbers from Rock River Arms and are identical.

I am selling these in Oklahoma City. I am asking $1800 each.


I may be willing to trade for something like a lot of BRASS ONLY .223, 5.56, or 300 blackout ammo. If a trade then the trade would have to be in my favor. I may trade for the right gun/guns. Just ask. All I can do is say no if I don't like the deal. Thanks for looking.

This is THE long range sniper set-up. Only shot about 100 rnds through it. Let's just say I watched the professional a little too much as a kid. This thing is crazy accurate, even at 300 yards I had no problem holding tight groups, at 100 I was picking off close pins. Its dialed and comes with everything you would need to hit the range/hunt. Also ammo, which good luck finding right now!"

It includes one 20 round magazine and one 10 rounder. I will also include 130 rounds of ammunition (40 Barnaul, 40 Winchester, 20 Remington Core-Lokt, 30 various loose). These guns are made by the same manufacturers as the FNAR and are essentially the same thing except that they have a camo finish and don't have the side rails. It is an a very accurate gun with a nice trigger pull. This gun has been used very little (approx. 20 rounds through it). It is in near perfect condition. There are a couple of very minor scratches in the paint on the barrel (barely noticeable). The scope is a Nikon Prostaff. The scope used to be painted camo (which I removed with nail polish remover) so there are a few spots of green paint in the crevices that I missed. The gun comes with the factory Winchester hard case, and includes all of the original interchangeable cheekpieces and recoil pads. Here are the specs from the Winchester site:

•Gas operated semi-automatic rifle with Mossy Oak® Brush™ camouflage finish
•Precision machined receiver from 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum
•Match grade hammer forged chrome plated 20” Heavy Contour Barrel with recessed target crown
•Crisp trigger
•Ergonomic fully adjustable stock with textured pistol grip and fore-end grip

Like new, very low round count. In my safe for 5 years and only shot two rounds with it. It is a dream to shoot.  Bought from a friends estate and he only shot a few rounds before passing on. This gun is highly desirable and scarce with this grade of wood. This is the prettiest wood you will ever see on an 1100. I have not seen one for sale yet that matches this tiger striped American Walnut. It is simply beautiful. Fires 2.5 & 3"" shells. Only the lightest handling marks, if any. Includes all the extended choke tubes, but no box or book. I will include a hard case (not factory), and some Ammo I have left over.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order:

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere. If I was, I would be advertising it to a national audience auction site and asking more. Like all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are a effing retard who shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it.

P.S.

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."

Here is some info I found out about this gun.

The Intratec TEC DC-9 ""assault pistol"", also known as DC-9, TEC-9, or, if manufactured after 1994, as AB-10, bears the dubious distinction of being one of the most widely used ""criminal"" guns in USA. It was used in several mass murder cases, as well as in unknown, but definitely large number of street fights and other violent crimes. TEC-9 became ""famous"" for its ""evil"" appearance, large magazine capacity (which offered significant firepower), and for low price. Unsurprisingly, these features made TEC-9 very popular among various marginal types. For any serious or professional shooter this gun vas of little value - it was too big and heavy to be carried comfortably, it was too unreliable when firing anything but FMJ ammunition, and the accuracy with very crude fixed sights was about marginal.

The TEC-9 design was started in Sweden, when the Interdynamic AB company of Stockholm developed a relatively simple submachine gun. Since Sweden was a poor market for such product, a subsidiary company Interdynamic was established in Miami (Florida, USA), to market Interdynamic guns in USA. As the full-automatic weapons market in USA is very restrictive, the basic submachine gun was converted in semi-automatic only variant, apparently suitable for civilian US market. This semi-automatic pistol, like its submachine gun predecessor, was a simple blowback design, firing from the open bolt. It was designated Interdynamic KG-9. But, sooner than later, US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) found that this semiautomatic pistol can be easily converted back to full automatic, and restricted it manufacture. Interdynamic redesigned the KG-9 into ""closed bolt"" design by adding the separate striker, and designated it KG-99. About the same time (mid-1980s) the Interdynamic of USA turned into Intratec Firearms, Inc, based in the same city of Miami (Florida). Intratec initially produced the KG-99 under the designation of TEC-9, but about 1989 renamed it into DC-9. With the introduction of the infamous US Assault Weapons Ban in 1994 the Intratec pistols were prohibited for manufacture (but not for ownership, if made before the ban). Intratec subsequently slightly redesigned the basic design, dropping some ""assault"" features like the threaded barrel, barrel shroud, and forward pistol grip. In this ""post-ban"" version the pistol was manufactured and sold as AB-10 (AB stands for After Ban). The AB-10 pistols were sold with 10-round magazines, but still could accept both factory and aftermarket high capacity magazines from its predecessors, TEC-9 and DC-9. There were several manufacturers in US, who made copies of DC-9, such as AA Arms, which produced DC-9 look-alike AP-9 pistols. Like originals, AP-9 pistols were of cheap construction and marginal reliability.

The Interdynamics and Intratec pistols are blowback operated, semi-automatic weapons. The major difference between Interdynamic KG-9 and Intratec TEC-9/AB-10 line of pistols is that KG-9 fired from the open bolt, and had a fixed firing pin; the Intratec pistols fire from closed bolt, and have a separate firing pin and a massive striker, which interoperates with the sear. The receivers of all versions are made from steel tube (either carbon or stainless), the frames (or ""lower receivers"") are made from polymer, integral with pistol grip and magazine housing ahead of the trigger guard. The tubular receiver is hinged to the front of the frame. There is no manual safety. The open-bolt Interdynamic KG-9 pistols featured a special cut, in which the charging handle can be locked when bolt in retracted. The KG-99 and Interdynamic pistols have manual safety built into charging handle - to lock the bolt, one must push the charging handle inward. All pistols are fed from double stack, detachable box magazines; standard magazine capacity was 20 or 32 rounds for pre-ban guns, and 10 rounds for post-ban guns. After-market magazines were offered in various capacities up to 50 rounds. Permanently fixed open sights were not adjustable, and often misaligned. In the pre-ban TEC-9 and DC-9 versions these pistol accepted screw-on barrel extensions, which had purely cosmetic purposes, or silencers (which were illegal in many jurisdictions)."

    The most beautiful gun I've ever owned, and probably the best trigger too. I don't want to get rid of this, but something has come up so I need better defensive guns or cash to buy them. Metal is pristine, stock and forearm have a number of dings. Crisp, crisp trigger. All metal internal parts, heavy barrel with band, and in the very rare stainless and laminate. You almost never see these come up for sale, and I know why. Asking $1500 or prefer to trade or part trade for a 1911 (5"" or 4.25, no firing pin safeties), Ruger LCR in .38, or an Ithaca 37 in 12 ga. Pics re too big for the thread margins so click the link.

It features a 20"" fluted heavy barrel with a target crown, an amazing two stage trigger, and rails for mounting optics and accessories on the top of the receiver and on all sides of the fore end. The platform is a modified version of the time testing Browning BAR hunting rifle that was developed for precision shooters. I have shot less than 100 rounds through the gun and it doesn't appear to need a ""break-in"" period. This rifle is an AR10 on steroids; it is better built, cleaner function, and has sub-moa accuracy out of the box

So if I can trade my FNP-9 for a G19 so i can be able to compete in more then just the sub compact comp.

All black FNP-9 i bought new and is still basically new. I've shot only 100 rounds through it 2 yrs ago. Cleaned it up and put it back in the case it comes with. It also has 3 16rd mags. It is smooth and with the decocker lever, it is convenient. It's basically a limited addition like every other FNP model. They originally made em for combat. Works great with gloves if you are a glove user during shooting.  Haven't had any jams or misfires...it has a light trigger pull and after the first shot its 1.5 lb trigger pull. Never read a negative review about it.. Great for conceal carry and very trust worthy.. 


Let me know what's you think.. Like I said I'm debating about trading it because of how hard it is to get but luckily extra magazines are easy. Not many company's made a combat pistol available for civilian purchase."

Action is sweeter than butter , and light years ahead of any RRA, Stags, Bush's etc. This is NOT a ""parts"" gun, this is all original except for the 2-3 ""bolt on"" items I added , like the Full Quad Rail, Target Grip etc. Originals pieces will be included. Chrome lined barrel.4-12 Ballistic Style Scope w QD rings, Foreward grip Bi Pod,Tactical Charging Latch, 3 Orig. COLT MAGS ( 2-20's & 1 30 ) Factory Colt,Manual,A new Clear Back 100 round mag,Sling and ""whatever"" else is shown but not listed here. The black mark on right side is tape so that the Brass catcher would not mar finish."

I believe this version has been discontinued...but they are still out there. I gotta have one of these before Feinstein and her flunkies ban them.
