Recently got a bolt action 223, just don't see this getting used much. Can do ~2"" groups at 100yds, probably could bring in more with better shooter behind the trig.

Like I said, I don't want to get rid of it, but will for the right trade.

CASH ONLY, $750, check the value of these on Gunbroker. The price is very fare for this rare firearm, good luck trying to find one of these locally again. And just so people know, this firearm is not nor was a kit, it came straight from the factory looking like a beast.


I have this listed on Gunbroker as well, get it before it's gone! If the listing has a bid, I will end this posting.

Up for sale is my FN TPS, in amazing condition! I have this shotgun set up for a single point sling, using a Daniel Defense A2 style ambi sling point (pictured). Also included on the shotgun is a Hogue rubber grip, which is very comfortable.

The action on this very intimidating shotgun is super smooth (just like a Winchester 1300, one of the smoothest pump shotguns). The shotgun uses AR15 style iron sights, fully ajustable, and also has a picatinny rail for your favourite optic! 

This shotgun is very rare, especially with the A2 style stock and screw in chokes. Some models of the FN TPS did not have screw in chokes, this one does! It uses Winchester 1300 style chokes, one choke is included (modified I believe). The A2 style stock also a swing door compartment to hold accessories. This is an FN shotgun, so it does have their beautiful logo :).

I have fired the shotgun, but it's in very, very good condition, inside and out!

The single point sling strap is not included.

455,http://www.armslist.com/posts/828455,For Sale:  BLACK TALON 40 S&W 180gr,"Littleton, Denver, Colorado",$ 100,"Listed On: Friday, February 1, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale are two boxes of Winchester Black Talon 40 S&W 180 Gr. SXT ammunition 20 cartridges to a box. Originally designed and released in 1991 this cartridge was the first to include a pre-scored jacket. It also included a reverse taper design which allowed its signature talons to be released perpendicular to the bullet upon impact. The black color of the bullet comes from the oxidized copper jacket and the LubaLox coating which was new for Winchester at the time. LubaLox protects the rifling of the barrel as well as provides lubrication for the bullet while traveling the length of the barrel. It is still used on many of their cartridges today minus the black color. In all Black Talon was cutting edge technology for its time, the best hollow point on the market. Without even being on the market for two years Winchester decided it was in the company's best interest to pull the Black Talon line in 1993. However the Black Talon bullet was re-incarnated into brass casings and sold in boxes of 50 to law enforcement only up until 2000 under the name Ranger SXT which stood for (Supreme expansion Talon) but the media once again criticized the ""Talon"" name into nonexistence and it became known as (Supreme eXpansion Technology) a much more ""politically correct"" term. Although the Black Talon's days seemed over Winchester released a new cartridge in 2009 following the design nearly identically with some modern advancements. This new cartridge which was also part of the Supreme Elite Series, same as the Black Talon is known as PDX1. PDX1 is debatably one of the best cartridges on the market today, so much so that it is the ammunition of choice by the FBI. So why not own a  piece of Winchester history? I hope you at least found my ad informative, thanks for looking.

Mine did not come with sights.
The gun comes with coyote brown rail covers, a Nikon Coyote 3-9x40 scope mounted in a LaRue LT104 QD mount. 10 30 round D&H mags with magpul anti tilt follower. Additionally I have somewhere around 1400-1500 rounds of .223. Instead of the A2 grip it has a Magpul MIAD grip. The gun has a brand new DD BCG and charging handle that the gun came with, I've been firing it with another bcg, all those mags are loaded. Basically this is the entire package, everything you could possibly need. This is not a DPMS or Stag or other janky gun. This rifle retailed for 1500+ before everything went to shit. Good luck getting one now.

596,http://www.armslist.com/posts/828596,For Sale:  Tactical Innovations forged stripped lower receiver AR-15 AR15,"Nixa, Springfield, Missouri",$ 350,"Listed On: Thursday, January 10, 2013",Rifles,Walther                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Tactical Innovations stripped lower receiver. Nice reveiver, comes with factory anti walk fire control group pins and upper to lower tensioning screw for excellent fit/finish. Here's why this is a superior lower to most standard ones:

FACTORY INSTALLED STBATM - Stainless Trigger & Bushing Assembly 




  The traditional steel hammer and trigger pins in the aluminum receiver have always been an area of concern for all AR15 shooters. In addition, the tolerances between the trigger and the trigger pin and the trigger pin and the receiver need to be as close as possible to provide a crisp trigger without creep and similar errors that will effect accuracy. Now with the addition of our STBA™ - Stainless Trigger & Bushing Assembly, you can easily solve all of the issues associated with hammer and trigger pins in your AR receiver including:

1. hammer/trigger pins precision CNC machined to .154 
2. no steel pin to aluminum receiver wear consideration 
3. stainless receiver bushings are threaded for replacement if necessary 
4. alignment is maintained at high tolerances due to precision fit between receiver bushing and pin 

These T15™ receivers are manufactured for the installation of the STBATM - Stainless Trigger & Bushing Assembly and are installed before they are shipped to your dealer. The CNC machined precision hex head non-rotation hammer and trigger pins are included, ready for your final assembly with your fire control parts. Never worry about pin wear, pin alignment or pin sizes again. Our STBATM - Stainless Trigger & Bushing Assembly - Another Tactical Innovations Exclusive!  
  2. PRECISION CNC MACHINED FROM US CERTIFIED FORGINGS 

 Our T15™ Lower Receivers are precision machined on modern CNC machining centers from US certified aluminum forgings for maximum strength, appearance and precision tolerances. Manufacturing is NOT sub-contracted to third party machine shops. If our name is on it, we make it here in our North Idaho manufacturing facility with complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process. Each receiver undergoes numerous quality checks throughout the machining process to ensure unparalled accuracy and dimentional tolerances.  
  3. MANUFACTURED FROM 7075 T6 ALLOY ALUMINUM FORGINGS (NOT 6061) 

 All T15™ Lower Receivers are manufactured from certified USA produced 7075 T6 aircraft grade aluminum alloy forgings. Sure, we could save a few dollars on the material and our tooling by using less expensive softer 6061 aluminum alloy. Other manufacturers claim that 6061 will hold up just as well as 7075... but we don't want alloy strength to be a discussion now or an issue later, so we only use the stronger, more expensive 7075 alloy for all of our receivers.  
  4. WIRE EDM MACHINED MAGWELL 








 Machining the magwell of all AR15 style lower receiver presents a few challenges since the magwell has square corners and it needs to be as smooth as possible on the inside for mag changes. To remove the material from the receiver for the magwell, most manufacturers machine from one side and then flip the receiver and machine from the other side to meet in the middle (and hope for no mismatch). But you still don't have square corners (since a round cutting tool will not cut a square corner), so they then they press a broach through the magwell to cut the round corners square. Its fast and does an ""OK"" job but for a finish that is considered by many to be the premium result, WIRE EDM is unparalleled. 
All of our T15™ Lower Receivers have WIRE EDM MACHINED MAGWELLS. Wire EDM machining uses a .010 (ten thousandths diameter) brass wire that passes an electrical current through it while the part is underwater. The wire does not touch the part, but arcs the current to the aluminum while flushing with high pressure water. When the complete magwell slug falls from the part, the result is that (1) the finish is unmatched for smoothness, (2) the corners are exactly square and (3) there is never any mismatch from machining from both sides and hoping to meet in the middle since its cut all the way through in one pass. 
So why doesn't every manufacturer wire EDM machine their magwells? Simple... it takes about 30 minutes per receiver to wire EDM machine EACH receiver on a machine that costs close to $90k. Is it an over kill to machine AR15 magwells? We don't think so. Check out the magwell on one of our T15™ Lower Receivers and see why you won't settle for ""good enough"" for your next receiver either! 

  5. LASER ENGRAVED MARKINGS 




 To engrave the ATF required markings on our T15™ Lower Receivers, we use the same laser technology that is used to mark diamonds and expensive medical equipment. The result is deep engraving that is crisp and clean and looks like it belongs on a custom high quality receiver. Safe and fire positions are designated with universal ""bullet logo"" pictographs for the elegant appearance that is generally found only on higher priced firearms. 
We cleanly mark the receiver with ATF's required information and do not clutter the receiver with logos or other advertisements. Why don't other lower receiver manufacturers also laser engrave their receivers? Once again it's laser machine cost and additional manufacturing time, but we think laser engraving is worth it! 

  6. SHIPPED AS A ""RECEIVER"" - YOU DESIGNATE RIFLE OR PISTOL 

 Since our virgin stripped T15™ Lower Receiver can be assembled in either a pistol or a rifle configuration (subject to ATF regulations), no designation of pistol or rifle is marked on the receiver which allows you to assemble it in either configuration you prefer (contact ATF for assembly restrictions and guidelines). The receiver is equally suited for either application. 
  7. MULTI CALIBER MARKED 

 AR style lower receivers are the host to a large variety of calibers beyond the traditional .223/9mm/22LR choices. In order to maximize your caliber use opportunities, each T15™ receiver is laser engraved to designate the caliber as Caliber - Multi to provide you with the maximum assembly flexibility.  
  8. UPPER RECEIVER TENSIONING SCREW - INCLUDED STANDARD 




 With the varying tolerances in upper receivers, its optomistic to hope that the recevier you use will be a perfect fit on any lower receiver and we all know that a loose fitting upper receiver will make even the best custom built rifle seem sloopy. Most shooters solve the problem with a wedge under the upper receiver lug when the receiver is closed. It works well, but is cumbersome. 
Our T15™ Lower Receivers come standard with an easier solution. A nylon tipped allen wrench drive screw is installed that can be adjusted through the bottom of the receiver. The upper receiver tensioning screw allows you to put exact pressure on the upper receiver for a perfect upper receiver fit every time.  A 1/8"" allen wrench (not included) is required for adjustment if necessary. 


  9. REAR PIN DETENT CAPTURE SCREW - INCLUDED STANDARD 

 Have you ever taken the stock off of an AR15 lower receiver and had the rear pin spring shoot out across the room? Our T15™ Lower Receivers solve the problem by installing an allen wrench drive screw in the spring channel. Once you install the detent and the spring, simply screw the set screw in flush with the rear of the receiver. Switch stocks as often as you want and the lost spring problem no longer exists!

Note: An .050 allen wrench (not included) is required in remove and install the Rear Detent Capture Screw.  When assembling the receiver, it may be necessary to clip a minor amount off of the spring to achieve the desired spring pressure on the detent in order to compensate for the set screw length.

  10. HAND FINISHED FOR A PREMIUM APPEARANCE 

 Most manufacturers ""finish"" their receivers in a bulk vibrator that indiscriminately rounds all edges in addition to the sharp ones. However, a receiver with these features and precision can only be finished one way... individually by hand! Each T15™ Lower Receiver is individually hand de-burred to remove all sharp edges from the machining process and then is individually abrasive blasted for a smooth, uniform surface finish in preparation for the final hard anodized finish. Our final visual quality control is simple to understand... ""If our finishing crew wouldn't buy it with their paycheck, we won't send it out."" Period.  
Thanks for taking the time to read why we believe our receivers offer the greatest quality and value of any receivers on the market. If you're ready to build an AR15 style firearm and want to start with a receiver that is worthy of your time and financial investment, our receivers can be purchased through any FFL holder identically to any other firearm. We're proud to put our name on our T15™ Lower Receivers and invite you to personally inspect the machining quality, the laser marking, the plentiful additional features and the individual hand finishing that make our T15™ Lower Receiver a receiver that you'll be proud to own and pleased to shoot."

Up for sale is a Pre '64 Winchester Model 70 bolt action rifle chambered in .270.  Wood is in good condition (my eyes estimate about 80%+) and metal is in excellent condition (95%+).  That brings the value of the gun up to around $2000+ based off of blue book values, but I already have a nice bolt action rifle that I prefer so I'm letting this baby to for a steal at $1500.  I'll throw in a nice padded case for it as well for any that are interested.

The rifle does already have a scope mounted on it, but honestly it's garbage.  One of the lenses got bent during shipping from being jostled around which makes it very hard to look through and get any sort of sight picture whatsoever.

I would prefer the cash, though I would entertain the following trades: Dan Wesson 1911 chambered in 9mm or .45 ACP, Mossberg Breacher shotgun + $1,000 cash, Springfield XDM chambered in 9mm, .40 S&W, or 45ACP + $800 cash, an AR conversion drop in for .22LR + $1200 cash, any and all AR-15s or AR-57 assault rifles (I'll negotiate + cash depending on the setup), a Benelli Black Eagle or Winchester SuperX3 (again cash amount negotiable).

This was the standard rifle of the Soviet Union, that is what they carried during their invasion of Afghanistan and it is the preferred cartridge of the Afghan Muja rebels even to this day. It is also used by the Iraqi and Afghan armies and is the most plentiful round found in the Middle East. Special forces wanted a reliable weapon which they could use in the field without having the carry a lot of ammo for it. The trouble with 5.56 nato was no opposing forces carried it in their rifles, so the US forces had to carry their ammo with them, once they ran out they either needed resupply or they were done for. In the mountains of Afghanistan resupply is not always a feasible alternative. However, there was plenty of 5.45x39 ammo lying around on the dead Taliban fighters, so the US special forces could always get that ammo. That is why Alexander Arms developed the AR in that cartridge. They are the only ones in the world to make an AR 15 rifle in that cartridge."

In the world of AK type rifles THIS GUN IS VERY RARE.  you almost never see them come up for sale.  Not sure what the components are, but it has a standard AK receiver, NOT A WASR type.  Regardless, it's the way they come from CAI, so look it up online.  It has a threaded barrel and a Yugo type slant muzzle break installed.

Price is $950 Firm.  Things are crazy right now with the ban likely coming in just a week or two by executive order from Chairman Obama - the worst president in the history of the US.

This rifle is Chambered in 7.62 x 39 mm, it takes all standard AK mags. The very best thing about this bullpup is that the overall length is only 27"". That is just over the Federal long gun cut off of “more than 26” and allows you to carry the rifle with much greater mobility. This configuration allows close quarters tactical use. Perfect for Law Enforcement, Military or Home Defense. The gun can be fired “from the hip” or from the shoulder without having to fold or unfold it to fire. It’s always 27” and always ready to fire. All high capacity magazines will clear the pistol grip. Bullpup stocks cannot be fired in a left handed position and are therefore only suitable for right handed shooters.

Buyer must sign a ""Buyer's Statement"" attesting to his or her legal ability to possess firearms in the State of Colorado. I will need to have you provide your Colorado driver's licence information prior to meeting for the sale. I will need this to prepare the buyer's statement form. You will receive a copy for your own records.  You must show your valid Colorado Driver's License to me at the time of sale.  

I reserve to right to decline sale to anyone that doesn't seem fit to have a gun, even if they are able to sign the statement.  CCW, active military, or law enforcement is greatly preferred, so they get a $50 instant rebate at time of sale.  Must have ID proving status."

I am willing to pay UP TO $400.00 for the right rifle..The stock is not important to me in terms of condition, What IS of great importance to me is the harware condition.... Barrel, Blueing, Sights, etc these parts need to be in good-excellent condition.

I have seen the Paratrooper version and that was what I REALLY wanted, unfortunately it was already sold....so onward to other opportunites.

I am NOT willing to pay the bloated/amped up over-inflated prices that has been occuring, especially for the SKS's...If you are trying to sell your garbage, please find another buyer...I will reject it if its crap.  I have done my research, and have the budget set aside for the right one... Again, the $400 is the MAXIMUM I will pay due to spousal budgetary limitations..anyone who's married can surely appreciate that.

I would like to trade for a PPS in 9mm, with however many magazine you might have (I have a 7 rounder, 6 rounder, and 5 rounder).  I can sell whatever mags you don't have a trade for, or we can maybe mix ammo into the trade or whatever.  I also have several hundred rounds of 40SW FMJ (I think it's federal).

One caveat is, and I'll be kinda depending on your decency as a human being: my gun is reliable 100% (so far, anyway, with almost a 50 JHP and a couple hundred FMJ rounds). No FTE, FTF, jams, anything. Just bang, extract, load, bang rinse repeat, everytime. Whatever I trade for, I would obviously like it to be the same way. In fact, if at all possible, I'd like to meet at the range to trade guns and shoot so we both know we like what we're getting. if this is not possible, not much I can do about it than to trust your word as a man/woman.

The reason I'm prattling on about it is because the PPS is my my primary concealed carry gun, and need it to be reliable, just like my 40sw one is.

Anyway, if you, or someone you know has a 9mm PPS that they want to trade to a 40SW for, I would love to chat and figure something out.

Save big dollars while shooting for pennies!!! 

The Huldra Mark IV 5.45 Carbine’s patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them harder than hard chrome. 

The 5.45x39 caliber bullet matches high muzzle velocity with excellent sectional density, resulting in a flat trajectory and good penetration. The standard ball cartridge will penetrate 5mm of steel plate at a distance of 350 meters. The lowered recoil impulse of the 5.45mm cartridge (verses the 7.62x39mm) has a beneficial effect on accuracy. The 5.45x39mm cartridge is an excellent round that offers comparable penetration, accuracy and lethality to anything fielded by NATO. More importantly, 5.45x39 ammunition is less expensive to shoot! This rifle has been designed to handle dirty and corrosive surplus ammunition. The bolt and bolt carrier have been protected by an ion-bond finish. These processes make the parts corrosive resistant. Now you have the ability to shoot the inexpensive corrosive mil-surplus ammo without the fear of the parts being unduly worn. 

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical tooling dimensions held within ±.001"" and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control."

Even with how overpriced everything is now, I think this is more than a fair trade for an AR-15, AK-47 or a really nice Saiga Semi-Auto Shotgun.  What you see is what you get:
1)  LNIB Springfield XDM (4 in barrel .40) with under 100 rounds fired through it
2)  500 rounds of .40 cal ammo
3)  Level IIIA Body Armor Vest – these will be harder to find after the ban; this one is practically free
4)  One 90 round drum for (.556 ammo) – you won’t be able to get one of these in a couple of weeks
5)  260 rounds of .556 ammo
