The rifle has had 200 rounds of Herter's non-corrosive steel-cased ammo fired for sighting in (minimal adjustment required, no cant) and function (this ammo fired flawlessly). Smooth action, great fit like most Bulgarian AK rifles. Finish is the stock Arsenal paint; in other words, looks great, but not particularly tough. There are scratches on the front sling attachment and wear in the usual spots from firing, but overall in very good shape.

Rifle comes with sling, oiler, buttstock cleaning kit, muzzle cover, 10rd Bulgarian waffle magazine.

I'm probably going to regret selling this rifle because it is out-of-production and hard-to-find, but I bought it to SBR and after much deliberation, have decided to find a 107UR instead. Will trade for a 107UR in similar condition or asking $1400 FTF. I prefer a trade, hoping to find a fellow AK enthusiast who would rather have the extra barrel length in an intermediate-length SBR (I've decided I'm willing to trade muzzle velocity for compactness)."

I inherited half my grandfathers guns when he passed a few months ago.  I'm not sure why he left them to me, so I am looking to sell them as I don't have a good place for them, and I don't know much about them. I talked to a guy at a gun shop and he gave me some prices I should ask for them.  He really wanted to buy them from me, but I thought about keeping them for a while.  I changed my mind though now.

here are the prices the gun shop told me to sell them for. most of them are in great condition. I will note anything not in great condition

1) Smith and Wesson model 29 44 magnum--just like Dirty Harry! 
             $500
2) Smith and Wesson model 28 357 magnum its black with wooden handles that are a little dirty and don't look as good as the others   $300

3) Smith and Wesson model 22 45  black wooden handles has a box 
             $300
4) Colt Trooper MKIII silver and shiny  wood handles says 357
           $250
5) Colt Trooper MKIII black rubber handles says 22 
            $200
6) Colt Detective Special black wooden handles--some of the black finish is rubbed off. I think the guy said it looked like it was carried?  $200

7) Colt Lawman black rubber handles  kind of beat up says 38 special $200

8) Colt Python  black wooden handles says 357 magnum has a box that is a little torn on the corners  gunshop guy really wanted this one.  he offered me $500 for it. I guess it s the most popular? 

9) Ruger Mark II  black its a 22  I used to shoot this with my grandpa
                     $200
10) Ruger Mrk II black has a longer barel  $200

11) Ruger cowboy gun like you see in the western movies silver finish $300

there are some rifles too.  I will put them in the rifle category

are these fair prices?  where do you find out?  I guess I will sell them for what he told me so email me your offers. I tried putting pictures of some on but it didn't work sorry"

1943 Colt Commercial military 1911A1 S/N 8615XX as described and explained in Both Charles Clawson’s “Collector’s guide to Colt .45 service pistols” and J.C. Harrison’s “U.S. Pistols & Revolvers 1909-1944”. For the avid 1911A1 collector, you know that this is a rare piece as described in Clawson’s book: Beginning in October 1942, the acute need for pistols prompted Colt to transfer 6,575 unsold commercial Government Model automatic pistols to their existing military contract. The existing commercial serial numbers were peened flat on the receiver and under the slide firing pin stop and restamped/renumbered in the military serial number range. All or most of these pistols were originally manufactured wit the Swartz safety. These safeties were removed when the pistol was transferred to the military contract and these “Swartz safety” pistols can be easily identified by a square hole located beside the disconnector cutout in the slide (THIS IS one) Slides retained the original commercial inscriptions . Barrels transferred with these pistols were either “S” (commercial) or “G” (standard military)…(This one contains a “G” barrel - The pistols were parkerized and submitted to Ordnance inspectors for military acceptance. An Ordnance inspection mark (crossed cannons) was stamped on the receivers W.B. inspectors initials were stamped on a few pistols through S/N 861000 and G.H.D. initials on all others (THIS RECEIVER IS G.H.D. STAMPED – . This particular pistol is in excellent condition inside and out ! Barrel rifling is clear, crisp and shiny

(This is straight off Diamondback's website)
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380, a micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magaine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. 

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

•Weight: 8.8 Ounces

Missing a magazine at the moment but they don't make this gun anymore.  If you research it with Remington you will find that there was a safety mechanism failure causing voluntary RECALL ORDER on the Remington 710.  However, only a few months of one of the 6 years that Remington made these rifles was a bad manufacturing time.  We have checked the serial number and it is (according to Remington's website) not a firearm that was produced during the safety recall period.  In other words, it's not a lemon, it's one of the good ones.  According to the Lawton Police Department, the serial number has no bad reports on it.  Will not sell to felons or mentally defective.  Will not sell to underage or drug users.  Have a picture ID ready.  If you would like to run the serial numbers we are willing to give the number to you.

I've had this for roughly six months and its just been collecting dust for the most part. The rifle is in almost new shape with the exception of the ""to be expected"" minor scratches. Very clean bore and internals.

This is a genuine Colt rifle, however it is made by Walther in Germany and imported by Umarex. For those of you that are not familiar with the Umarex/Colt .22's, you should know that this is as good as it gets for a .22 semi auto rifle. VERY accurate and CHEAP AS HELL TO SHOOT. Ammo prices are on the rise and the cost of shooting your .223 AR is damn near the cost of putting your kids through college these days. .22 is the way to go for plinking! 

FEATURES; 21.2"" chrome lined precision barrel with a 1 in 13 3/4 twist. Adjustable bolt speed so that you can shoot a variety of ammo without any hiccups. SPR Rail interface system PLENTY of room for all your ""tacticool"" goodies. Flip-up sights.

COMES WITH; 30 round magazine, rail covers, flip up sights, paperwork. I also have a red/green dot scope on a riser mount for it if you're interested. (not included) I will also throw in 200 rounds of 40 grain Federal ""Lightning"", I have shot this ammo and ONLY this ammo through this rifle. She likes it :)


I will trade/ sell FACE TO FACE ONLY... NO EXCEPTIONS. Absolutely no felons/criminals. You must be legal to own this rifle!!! If you don't have a valid ID or if you aren't willing to sign a bill of sale then DON'T bother to email me.

The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating bolt for positive lock-up.
The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. Maximum effective range with the standard 6-inch barrel is 200 meters (650 ft.).
The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear and enhances the obturation between the bullet and the bore, thus increasing accuracy.
Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The combat-type trigger guard is designed for two-handed shooting.
The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition.
When the last round in the magazine is fired, the slide remains in its maximum recoil position, permitting rapid change of magazine and immediate chambering of a round for instant resumption of firing."

I prefer something in .357. I will consider all offers though. I am not interested in guns with a long barrel. So if I will have to struggle to conceal it...the barrel is too long. Also, nothing too old please, the newer the better. I have a preference of SS over blued any day of the week.

I will consider trades for pretty much any other gun related items (bulk .40 ammo in JHP or FMJ, handguns, rifles, shotguns...no reloading supplies please)

My preference is the revolver but I am open to anything gun related. Worse I can do is say no.

The bow is in good to great condition. There is some chipped paint on the place where you adjust the poundage on the limbs, but besides that the bow looks amazing. It has never seen the woods nor been hunted with. It has only been used for target shooting for the past few years. The bow comes with everything seen in the pictures. It comes with Apex Sight (bought in Feb.), limb saver stabilizer, and ripcord drop away arrow rest, d-loop, peep, and wrist strap. The string was replaced last year. I bought this bow for my girlfriend for Christmas and she said this was by far the best gift she had ever received. The Mustang only goes up to 50lb limbs, and she has already out-grown that. If it weren’t for the fact of needing to upgrade, she would still be shooting the Mustang. I am trying to save up some money to buy her another bow for her birthday in October, that’s why I am selling her old bow. If you have any questions please ask. I check my ebay 3-4 times each day. I strive for 100% feedback and I try to list things as accurately as possible. If there is something wrong with the item, please message me and we will try and work it out, before you leave feedback.

This is a BowTech Mighty Mite with 60lbs – 70lbs limbs with a 27” draw length. I am selling this for my girlfriend’s dad. He just bought a new bow and no longer has any use for this bow. I knew nothing about this bow so I took it into an outdoor shop (Mark’s Outdoors) and they said that this bow was in good to great used condition. He has not changed the strings in several years, but they do seem to be in good condition. The bow comes with everything seen in the pictures. Its fully loaded with sight, peep, d-loop, string dampers, whisker biscuit, stabilizer, limb dampers, 3 arrow quiver, and 9 carbon express arrows (one arrow is missing a nock). The bow was hunted with for several years so there is some chipped paint here and there. But overall I say this is a great bow for anyone to hunt with. I was going to buy it for myself, but I am trying to save some money so I can ask his daughter to marry me. If you have any questions please ask. I check my ebay 3-4 times a day. I strive for 100% feedback and I try to list things as accurately as possible. If there is something wrong with the item, please message me and we will try and work it out, before you leave feedback. Thanks!

Keychain, hard case, black in color
I'm selling the following Pepper Spray at my cost, which is $5.00

This is **Brand New** Pepper Spray. Feel free to check the ""Expiration Date"" before you buy.

**Free refills** for life!! If you ever use this spray in a real attack/self-defense, you will get a replacement ""spray"" for FREE, just send me a copy of the police report.

This spray has an Ultra-Violet Light Identifying Dye (which helps to ID these Ass-holes) includes both a clip (to easily attach it to your clothes while walking) and a key ring.

PEPPER SPRAY FACTS:
Pepper spray enables you to defend yourself while keeping a safe distance from an attacker. Pepper sprays induce an almost immediate burning sensation of the skin and a burning, tearing, and swelling of the eyes. If spray is inhaled, the respiratory tract becomes inflamed resulting in a swelling of the mucous membranes lining the breathing passages and temporarily restricting breathing to short, shallow breaths. A one second burst to the face will cause temporary blindness, choking, coughing, and nausea-disabling your attacker giving you time to escape.

The active ingredient in this spray is Oleoresin Capsicum (O.C.), commonly referred to as red pepper. It is a natural, oily, resin-like substance derived from hot peppers, the same peppers used to make spicy foods hot.

When considering which pepper spray is most effective, one must consider the percentage of pepper being used and the heat rating of that pepper (measured in Scoville Heat Units or S.H.U.). A good pepper sprays has a rating of 2 million S.H.U. or higher... 

**Don't be fooled by the claims ""Hottest allowed by law"" and ""Hottest in the industry"" that are made by some on the web. This gives people a false sense of security.**

**Federal law does not allow carrying any type of pepper spray on airplanes or in the security areas of an airport. They are also prohibited on aircraft because the drop in air pressure can cause the pepper spray canisters to explode. For the same reason, pepper spray cannot be shipped by air. **If you're flying, I'll tell/show you how to make your spray ""airplane safe"". Just e-mail me.

Always remember that you assume all risk and liability for owning and using pepper spray. Even if you use it correctly, there is no guarantee that it will always be effective at hindering an attack, and there is always the possibility that it may be used against you instead.

**Consult the laws of your state and/or local agency. Understand and Obey them before owning pepper spray.**

I bought these rings back in 2007 to attach to a .50 BMG rifle.  However, when I received them they sat too low on the rail and interfered with the BUIS.  So they have never been used, nor mounted.  I ended up buying some other rings that were higher.  I purchased these for $175 straight from SWFA and had to wait for 3.5 months to receive them.  If you are in the market for quality scope rings that can take the shock of a .50 BMG, these are for you.  Original oil and finish still 100%.  Comes with Torx wrench, as shown.  Price above ($140) includes Priority Mail shipping (USPS).  Don't wait like I had to, get them today!

The bow is in good to great condition. There is some chipped paint on the place where you adjust the poundage on the limbs, but besides that the bow looks amazing. It has never seen the woods nor been hunted with. It has only been used for target shooting for the past few years. The bow comes with everything seen in the pictures. It comes with Apex Sight (bought in Feb.), Apex Quiver, 6 Carbon Express Maxima Hunter Arrows, limb saver stabilizer, and ripcord drop away arrow rest, d-loop, peep, and wrist strap. The string was replaced last year. I bought this bow for my girlfriend for Christmas and she said this was by far the best gift she had ever received. The Mustang only goes up to 50lb limbs, and she has already out-grown that. If it weren’t for the fact of needing to upgrade, she would still be shooting the Mustang. I am trying to save up some money to buy her another bow for her birthday in October, that’s why I am selling her old bow. If you have any questions please ask.

I had Mr. Archery in Bolivar install the new accessories and tune it to 60 lb. and 29"" draw.  After a few practice shots I was hitting center target at 20 yds. every time, and the last time I shot a bow was 25 years ago using a old bow.  A lot has changed in 25 years in bow technology!  I was planning on getting back into bow hunting so I wanted the best equipment I could get.  Now that I have it, I know that I will not have time to hunt like I wanted to.  Other than a few practice shots this bow is like new in mint condition with absolutely no scratches or blemishes. The bow is decked out in Max-Adv.HD camo and looks as good as it shoots - smooth, quiet, and fast!  
I have a lot more invested in it than I what I'm asking.

Comes with everything you need to get out on a hunt or go for a day of recreational shooting. Another great benefit of the T/C Hawken if you aren't already familiar, is it's double trigger design. The rear trigger is a more full pull, which engages the front trigger in such a way that the front trigger needs only a slight touch to set off the hammer and launch the ball. This makes for greater accuracy. The trigger also has a half back setting allowing you to load a cap before finding your animal. Then, when ready, you pull back the hammer another notch, engage the trigger and fire!"

I am asking $500 for this great rifle in great condition.  

A review I read from Sniper Central stated the following about the accuracy: ""The overall average for all groups fired with Federal GMM was .466"". So, this particular rifle, even with the front of the rubber stock touching the barrel slightly, is clearly sub .5 MOA rifle out of the box.""

Below is from the Remington website:
Overview:

The Model 700 SPS puts legendary Model 700 accuracy and reliability within reach of most avid enthusiasts. It's a no-frills, tack-driving game-dropping machine built with everything you love about the Model 700, including a hammer-forged barrel, externally adjustable X-Mark Pro® trigger, SuperCell™ recoil pad and, of course, hair-splitting precision, straight out of the box. It features an ultra-rugged, ergonomically designed synthetic stock for superior weather resistance and handling.

Visit the NEW Remington 700 Network website

The Model 700 SPS Tactical is a highly maneuverable member of the family, built for tack driving accuracy with a 20"" heavy-contour tactical-style barrel and dual-point pillar bedding in its black synthetic stock. Hogue® overmoldings on the stock facilitate sure handling, and it has a semi-beavertail fore-end for added stability off a rest. Chambering includes 223 Remington and 308 Win.

I am interested in some rifles, small calibers. I will expect boot with most of these pistols, I can add cash for a 2 pistol trade. Not interested in any large caliber rifles, only thing I do is shoot paper 95% of the time. I have mine fairly priced so don't expect a trade value on your used weapon to be at new costs. But I am open to all gun trades. Thanks again
