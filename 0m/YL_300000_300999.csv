There is absolutely nothing wrong with the gun but I've found that the pistol doesn't fit my hands that well and I would rather have a 9mm that is cheaper to shoot. I would like to do an even trade as long as the Beretta or CZ 75 is in great shape. I will also throw in a Blackhawk holster. If trade is local, I would throw in 100 rounds of .40 S&W as well."

The Smith & Wesson J-Frame has become the most popular small frame personal defense revolver on the market. With decades of reliable performance to its credit.

The reason I'm selling this gun is because when I ordered it I got the model numbers mixed up & I had wanted an Airweight & hammerless model.  When I picked it up & took it home I realized that it was not the gun that I had wanted.  The dealer informed me when I called him that it was hammerless & that they would not take it back but if I would pay for the shipping & processing fees he would get me the correct gun ( model 642).  
When I asked him why he didn't let me know when I asked for the gun in an Airweight & hammerless why he didn't tell me that model didnt come with those options he got really mad at me & said he was a gunsmith & he knew what he was talking about & I didn't.   So I don't want to continue to do business with this gentleman  just want to get my money back & get the model tha I want.

I can't get the pictures to load so reply to this posting & I will email pictures

I did not want to remove due to the fact, you can see how little use this gun has had. Nobody has done the scrub-a-dub-dub on this one. It comes with factory correct box, and I do believe all factory goodies included. I am open to offers for  1911's,  ACOG,  Saiga 12,  Judge  and who knows, maybe the first born.

Please be aware, when pricing this on NADA, NADA is giving BASE VALUES FOR STANDARD EQUIPMENT, no options, no cover, no trailer and a 50hp 2 stroke motor ( this has a 60hp fuel injected 4 stroke... ). No, I won't sell the boat for $6250. 

Aluminum hull, single console

Includes:
Two live wells

ProSport 8 Dual bank marine battery charger
2 batteries, one cranking, one deep cycle
AM/FM CD player w/2 speakers.
Full cover with three support poles
Trailer has a swing away tongue. The boat WILL FIT in a building as small as 20' deep with ease.

The seats are all in very good condition, as is the carpet. There are a few small stains in the carpet. There is a slight amount of dock rash on one side. There is no spare tire/rim. I can send detailed photos of all issues. The trailer tires have taken on a goofy wear pattern. I suspect the air pressure was low. There is still plenty of tread. 

This was my father in laws boat. He passed away and we have no use for this. Overall, this is a great boat. It starts and runs perfectly. Top speed is mid 30s according to the speedo. It isn't new, nor is it perfect, but is very presentable and respectable. If it was a pontoon, I'd keep it.

Engine hours are unknown. My father in law has fought cancer the past two years and the boat has sat idle the entire time. 

My wife and I took it out on the water over New Year's weekend at the Lake of the Ozarks and ran it between the 23 and 26mm. It ran perfectly and handled the wind chop better than I expected. 

Do feel free to call or email with any questions you have. I'll happily send detailed photographs (taken in the fall just before I put it in storage ). 

The boat is currently in Sunrise Beach, Mo in inside storage. I live in NE Kansas. Arrangements will need to be made in advance to view the boat. 

Watertests will not happen without proof of funds. That means CASH or CHECK IN HAND. Sorry folks, I'm selling a boat, not giving free boat rides. I'll happily hook it to the garden hose and run the motor for anyone interested.

I have a Remington 700 in 308 with a 18.5in barrel that has been threaded to 5/8-24 and currently has a custom break from a Sniperhide member that is tapered to the rifle, it also has a extended floorplate for a few more rounds.The stock is a Bell & Carlson Tactical Medalist Style. The rifle has less than 80 rounds down the pipe and is a great shooter, the break made it shoot lighter than my 243. i will not be including the scope, stock is also negotiable if you don't want it,  i have 2 factory stocks for it so it wont go naked. please disregard my messy desk.

It is a full Govt size pistol. It comes with the case, papers, test shells, 2 Colt 7rd mags, 1 Promag 10rd mag, Gripmaster digital desert laser grips ($170) that came with it new, stainless compensator, stainless extended slide release, stainless grip safety, stainless mainspring housing, stainless mag release, stainless thumb safety, stainless Commander hammer, stainless trigger, blued slide, polished barrel, black Duracoat frame. 

I paid to have all stainless hardware put on it, to have the frame Duracoated satin black, slide blued and tightened/fitted to frame by Schramm's in Dallas. 

I DO NOT have any extra parts for this. What it has on it are what it comes with.

The slide and frame are fitted perfectly with no play. The action is tight and smooth.

I am getting rid of some pistols, I bought this thinking I would have time to get serious about shooting, and dropped some cash to deck it out, and then life changed (wife, kids, etc.).  I have shot this twice in the last 2 years with about 4 boxes, since I bought it new, and the 45 ammo is expensive. The barrel will prove this, lands and grooves are perfect, non-existant wear marks.

All 1911 parts can be put on this pistol. Some may require fitting.

FTF in Wichita only, I am not going to travel.

I have a Savage Arms/Springfield model 187M in .22. This is one of the old ones that did not have a serial number’s. I took this in trade a few years ago and until recently it sat in a closet. A couple of months ago, I was going to use her as a Squirrel rifle, put a scope on her and we went to the range. Short of this is that after the first shot, the second round stove pipes because the first is not ejected soon enough. Brought her home, completely stripped her down and nothing really stood out as a problem. I ordered new breech bolt, hammer and extractor plunger springs; installed them and went back to the range. Same problem..I went back and ordered a new extractor, installed it and again…same problem so I put it back in the closet. After doing research on this issue, I did find out that especially in older .22’s that were dry-fired; after awhile the firing pin will gouge the chamber causing stove piping. I ordered the “.22 Rimfire Chamber Ironing Swage” from Brownells for $20.00 plus shipping and thought I had finally got it. No luck and it went back to the closet. Last week, while looking for something in this closet I bumped the rifle and it fell over and the front site landed on my toe. This rifle has to go! I figure if I sell/trade it now for $75.00, I’ll only be down a lot of aggravation and a $100.00 or so. I’ll sell outright for $75.00 or trade for ammo. (12 gauge, .45, .40, 9mm or .32) Again, this rifle is a nice rifel for its age and very accurate if you only shooting one round at a time. If you can fix it or have experience with these; $75.00 is a steal. Or if you have some extra time on your hands, you could part it out and easily make over $150.00 or so."

This is a rare collectable because it was an special order gun from Ashland Shooting Supply. Ashland Shooting Supply was a big company that use to order specially made guns from Smith and Wesson and there is a rumor that only 25 S&W 469's were made in nickel.  Smith and Wesson only made the 469 in blue for the public and it's a great concealable handgun chambered for the 9mm Parabellum. The magazine that is included will hold 12 rounds. The barrel on this gun is 3.5"" long and the hammer is bobed and does not protrude when it is down. The safeties on this gun include a decocker and a magazine disconnect. The model 469 was introduced in 1983 and discontinued in 1988.

I've been more into Bow these last years but would like to get into a good rifle. Just finishing electricians school so cash is a little tight for buying new,  so if someone had one they'd be willing to part with, I'd love to talk.

This is a Henry US survival Rifle. the whole thing comes apart and can be stored in the butt stock. from closed up to firing can be done in only about 30 seconds. Another cool feature about this gun is that it FLOATS, that's right it floats. with everything in the butt stock or fully put together you can drop it in the water and it will bob up and down like a buoy. It is in average condition and still works as it should.
I bought this for taking out on my boat but no longer need it.
Would be a great SHTF type bug-out gun or for hiking and camping because it is so light weight and can be packed up so small.
The reason Im selling is because times have gotten tough and the toys are the first things to go.
This is also a Great conversation piece too, everyone whats to check it out.

The photos, because they were taken with flash, make the surface appear rougher than it is.  I will take a couple of photos in natural light to better show the true look.

(BPM is made in Apex, NC) and a Del-Ton Upper Receiver with a Larue 7.0 Rail.

The Lower Specs
-Standard BPM internals
-Collapsible 6-Position buttstock

The Upper Specs:
-Flat top A3 style upper
-Del-Ton 1/9 twist Chrome Lined Barrel
-A2 Flash Hider
-16"" Barrel with M203 cutout
-F Marked Front sight 
-Carbine Length Gas system
-Larue Tactical 7.0 Free Float Rail System
-Complete BCG and charging handle

The upper and lower on this rifle look great with just a couple of small marks on them. The Larue 7.0 rail was bought used after I bought the gun and had seen some use, therefore it has quiet a few marks on it as seen in the pictures, but nothing is wrong with it. Also, when I put the rail on, I slipped with the punch and made a mark on the FSB. Cosmetically, the rifle isnt 100%, but it is 100% in function. The Larue 7.0 rail is one of the best rails on the market, free floats your barrel(improved accuracy) has a nice slim profile, and adds almost no weight the the rifle. (the rail brand new is $250) The rifle really does handle very nice. The rifle doesnt come with sites but does include five magazines and three Knights Armament rail panels. If you dont want the Larue rail or panels, I'll drop the price to $700 and put the standard plastic handguards back on. If you have any questions, shoot me an email and I'll answer them ASAP. Only looking to do FTF in North Carolina. I dont want to travel more than a couple of hours from Moore county but just ask, and we'll work something out.
