All proof marks are nice and heavy and easy to make out. The bolt functions very nicely for a Mosin. With a little work on the sear, it would be a very nice shooter.

I've had my fun with Mosins. I have a couple others and I would like to sell this to someone who would like a nice example of an original configuration. If anything else, it would be a cheap deer rifle. You can get soft pointed ammo for these and are more than capable of being accurate enough to bag a deer.

Bought new this spring for carry, but I carry a .45 now so it sits in the safe.  I have fired between 350-400 rnds through it.  This gun has the real accessory rail, not the one that requires an aftermarket clamp to mount stuff. It features ambidextrous safety, slide release.  Polygonal rifling (better velocity/accuracy and longer life) that looks like black glass inside barrel.  I only did 2 things to this gun and that was have a stronger spring put in the extractor and the have the bore polished as it started out a little finicky extracting with the Winchester white box ammo.  Shoots anything now.  It has a lifetime warranty so if you have any issues, you can get it fixed.

This gun is extremely accurate and handles great for rapid-fire.  It fits the hand perfectly and is easy to shoot well.

Comes with box, key, (2) 10-round magazines, and (1) 13-round magazine.

These go for around $400 new with just the 2 magazines so my price is fair.

This Model 18-3 is in NIB condition and comes with the original box and paperwork. This Model 18-3 has NEVER been fired!  The original owner did change the grips to pearl handled as can be seen and unfortunately could not locate the originals.  However, it is very difficult to find an original model 18 in unfired condition as they are GREAT shooters and definitely saw their use throughout the years.

 Description M500A
The SureFire M500A replaces the original handguards of your M4 or similar carbine. It features a 9-volt shock-isolated incandescent lamp with a 1.62"" reflector suited to close- to medium-range applications, and two low-output navigation lights available in white, red, or blue. Primary beam output is 125 lumens for one-hour of runtime using an MN10 lamp assembly (included) or 225 lumens for 20 minutes using an MN11 lamp assembly (included). The M500A has three primary beam switches integrated into the forend: a constant-on rocker switch (left side), a momentary-on pressure pad switch (right side), and a system-disable rotary switch (rear of battery housing) that locks all lights in the OFF position to prevent accidental activation during covert operations, transport, or storage. The navigation lights are operated by a smaller momentary-on pressure pad switch (left side). Proven in combat, used by military and law-enforcement around the world.

Great starter pistol or for Concealed Carry. I have bought a different CC pistol and no longer need this one. This pistol is in great shape and has already been warranty repaired by Colorado Gun Works. These pistols have a factory problem of a spring jumping out the notch that is suppose to ride in and then fires erractically. CGW has machined the notch a little deeper and then inserted the spring and staked it off. Unlike a lot of other Bersa's out there, this one will now fire reliably when needed. Great pistol, just not needed anymore. Comes is factory box, key for integrated trigger lock, external trigger lock, factory test round, blackhawk holster, and factory magazine. One of the coolest features of this pistol is that fact that it is a Double Action/Single Action pistol with a De-cocker. This means you can breach a bullet into the chamber and then de-cock it. So then if you needed to defend yourself it will take a harder, safer, double action trigger pull to get the first round off. Then every round after that is single action. Love this feature. Alot of your smaller CC pistol are Double Action only, of which is not nearly as accurate as sngle action. Email if you would like to set up a meet to look at this pistol.

Looking to trade my Glock 27 Gen4 w/ three 9 round and two 15 round mags for a Glock/Springfield XD standard/duty size in 9mm or 40 s&w. I bought the Glock 27 new less then a month ago (I have the receipt) and put 490 rounds in total of Winchester 165gr fmj & 185gr jhp, Fiocchi 165gr jhp, and Hornady 165gr Critical Defense through the gun without any issues. The reason I want to trade is that a subcompact is just not for me and my large fat hands, heh. 

This would be a straight trade FTF around the Oshkosh area and you are legally able to own a handgun. Please supply the make, model, and general history info via email about the handgun you would like to trade."

Functions great, less than 200 rounds through it, had 2 FTF in the first 25 rounds, has been fine since. I'd attribute this to normal break in.

Interceptor is a type of body armor fielded by the U.S. military. It is more effective than traditional bulletproof vests and is the successor to Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT). 

Technical Details:

The Interceptor can not, however, be called a truly Level III-A vest as military standard does not require protection against heavy .44 Magnum ammunition. However, both Level III-A vests and Interceptor do protect from much lighter 9mm threats in identical tests. The vest will stop other, slower-moving fragments and is also equipped with removable neck, throat and  shoulder  protection.

The blades of each are hand-forged and folded from K120C powder steel. The saya are deeply lacquered in gold with inlaid brass cherry blossom (sakura) flowers. High quality ray skin (same) is used on the tsuka of the katana and wakizashi, while the tsuka of the tanto is a gold-plated brass with decoration in relief. The tsuba of the katana and wakizashi is of blackened and bronzed iron, with detailing in gold and silver and a battle scene decoration. The tsuka-ito on the katana and wakizashi and the sageo on all three pieces are woven from premium Japanese cotton. The fuchi and kashira are of blackened bronze with brass detailing, and the kojiri, koiguchi and kurikata are of polished buffalo horn. The habaki is a one-piece brass construction. The katana and wakizashi blades are un-grooved. The katana and wakizashi have medium-length (chu) kissaki.

The GSG-5 is a semi-automatic rimfire rifle chambered for the .22 LR cartridge and is produced by German Sport Guns. In many ways, the GSG-5 is an exact replica of the Heckler & Koch MP 5 sub-machinegun. 

Ergonomics and handling are identical to that of the MP 5 with an overall length of 33.5” and a weight of 6.6 pounds which makes it an ideal training tool for law enforcement, military personnel and civilians. 22 long rifles offer an immense savings over 9mm/40/45 caliber ammunition allowing extensive range time with the GSG-5 at a minimal cost to the user. 

Barrel length on the GSG-5 rifle is 16.25 inches including the faux suppressor which surpasses federal requirements, making it legal to own by anyone. The GSG-5 utilizes either a 22 or 10 rd detachable box magazine that releases with an H&K style paddle magazine release. The charging handle on the GSG-5 is located on the left side of the receiver and is non-reciprocating just like the H&K MP5 series. 

The GSG-5 comes standard with a conventional MP 5 style stock and forend but American Tactical Imports also offers several different style stocks and tactical forends including a side-folding stock like the H&K MP5k-PDW and a retractable stock as offered on the H&K MP5A3. The GSG-5 comes with a standard H&K style forend but is upgradeable to a tactical railed forend that accepts tactical grips, lights and lasers.

The GSG-5 utilizes the H&K style drum sight, which can be adjusted for both windage and elevation. Accessories available for the GSG-5 include a claw mount with Picatinny rail allowing just about any optic from a tactical or hunting scope to a close quarters battle optic like a red dot sight to be mounted on the receiver. In addition to extra magazines ATI also offers a tactical magazine coupler for joining two magazines together, making for a faster reload. American Tactical Imports also offers an MP 5 SD style barrel/faux suppressor, which looks exactly like the original. Whether you are looking for a low cost tactical trainer or a fun plinker the GSG-5 rifle is a winning choice. 

In 2009, H&K instituted a lawsuit against both German Sport Guns and American Tactical Imports, Inc., over trade dress infringements. The lawsuit was settled in October of 2009, and resulted in the production and importation of the original GSG-5 design to cease as of Oct. 8, 2009. The remaining stocks will continue to be sold until January 31, 2010, at which time all sales of the GSG-5 by American Tactical Imports must be concluded."
