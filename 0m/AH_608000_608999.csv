This scope does NOT have the Posi-Lock adjusting system. Never Installed or torqued into rings, only set into rings to check eye relief. I am selling this scope due to requiring a scope that has more eye relief than this unit has. I have a Smith & Wesson Performance Shop revolver with a 10.5"" barrel and it has a Picatinny Rail machined into the top of the barrel. This mounting position puts a scope farther forward than the more traditional frame mount, and at high magnification this scope loses a bit of viewing area, so is therefore not suitable for my needs. If frame mounted, this scope would be perfect. Scope comes with box, product guide, and an unfilled out warranty card. Burris scopes are made in the USA and have a lifetime warranty. More pictures are available upon request. My loss, your gain. Asking $275 or best offer."

Stiffer spring and recoil buffer for reduced recoil

To those who do not know: Nearly every AMD-65 you buy online WILL eventually crack their muzzle brake weld.  At the very least a wiggly muzzle device will throw off aim or even present a safety hazard, at worst if your muzzle brake is able to be wrestled off by hand, then you could be charged with a felony for possessing a short-barreled rifle (12"" on these things) with no stamp. This one has been TIG welded on and will never have that problem.

This is an incredible pistol and serves as my EDC. It's trigger is the best striker fired pistol trigger I have ever used - with the exception of a possible tie in the Walther PPQ - and the quick sight system makes this the fastest on target gun I have ever used. Accuracy is excellent, recoil is extremely soft for fast double taps. Excellent capacity, comfort, and durability in a sub $500 package - all with a lifetime warranty!

Don't have anything particular in mind....but don't need single-shot rifle or shotgun. Would consider a 410 or 20 gauge shotgun.

On it is mounted an S&K scope mount and a $40 scope....forget the name brand of the scope.

I gave $70 alone for the scope mount.

Nothing wrong with the gun or scope, but the scope mount does need to be remounted with Loctite. (thread locker) as it has has worked loose. I was very happy with the S&K scope mount. It is a great mount that has no stripped screws or threads. This gun will even shake your teeth loose. Earthquake in a barrel.

It's a very fun and cheap gun to shoot. I'm just ready to try something else.

This is compatible with Gen 1, 2 or 3. It is not compatible with Glock Gen 4 - sorry! This kit is in great condition and comes w/ all factory accessories. I'm including an extra 10 rd magazine. Price is $300.

Item Description:
These kits are had to find because the manufacturer Advantage Arms are working a large commercial contract and kits sold to individuals are extremely hard to find right now. This is a valuable training aid to maintain proficiency, train new shooters, or just to casually plink with. It is very reliable & easy to install.

For anyone who shoots very much it can easily pay for itself in just one year. Training sessions are more enjoyable / affordable when each shot is only $ .03-.04 per round. 

I'm an individual and not a dealer. I will mark this ad as ""Sold"" once it's no longer available. Would trade for a S&W M&P 9mm handgun, S&W M&P 22, Glock, or Ruger SR22.

KAHR CW45

Big-bore self-defense in a concealable package!

Pocket Pistols, 2011 Buyer’s Guide, page 58 ~ 59
By Clair Rees



Fired from a sandbagged rest at 25 yards, the Kahr CW45 punched this 2.4-inch group with Black Hills ammo.
While the newer .380s are a delight to carry, most shooters are familiar with the adage: “Never take a knife to a gunfight.” The .380 is a step up from a knife—but not a huge step. Carrying a .380 or even a .25 ACP pistol can be comforting. However, if you’re still concerned about protecting yourself in a deadly confrontation, you want a bigger gun—the bigger, the better!
Ever since the Army trained me to use a 1911, I’ve been a fan of this great gun and the ammo it shoots—hard-hitting rounds that penetrate well and pack a real punch. I have a handful of both factory and custom 1911A1 pistols, practicing with them every chance I get. While the right holsters make it possible to carry a 1911 fully concealed, the gun’s bulk and substantial heft make daily carry problematic.
GUN DETAILS

Kahr came up with an excellent answer. The CW45 has a locked-breech, tilting barrel design very similar to that used in the venerable 1911. Disassembly is an even simpler process than the 1911 requires. However, the Kahr operates in double-action only (DAO) mode and is fired by a striker—not an external hammer.
Kahr is famous for producing compact, imaginatively designed pistols that work reallly well. The CW (Compact Weapon) 45 is a stellar example. While it digests bulky .45 ACP ammo, the gun is only 6.32 inches long, 4.8 inches tall and a scant one-inch thick. The stainless steel, conventionally rifled barrel measures 3.64 inches in length. Weight (unloaded) is just 21.7 ounces.
Fitting the gun’s innards into such a compact package was a real engineering feat. One space-saving innovation was relocating the feeding ramp slightly to the left to center. In addition to reducing the height of the frame, it created extra space for the operating system. While the feed ramp is no longer centered, it funnels cartridges into the chamber with excellent reliability.
The slide is machined from stainless steel, while the polymer frame reduces weight without sacrificing needed strength. The stippled grip feels good in my hand (unlike pistols with much blockier grips), and the gun points very naturally. There are no manual safeties—not even one that prevents firing when the magazine is removed. The gun’s multi-patented firing system blocks the striker-activated firing pin unless the trigger is pulled. External controls are limited to the trigger, slide stop and magazine release.
The CW45 is basically a lower-priced version of the larger TP and KP-series pistold produced earlier, and the compact PM45 pistols that came along a little later. Economy measures include creating the magazine release, slide stop and firing pin block by metal-injection-molding. Only one magazine is provided (other Kahr .45s come with two) . Also, the front sight isn’t drift-adjustable, but is pinned in place. A vertical while bar guides your eye to the rear sighting notch, while the front sight face features a large, while round dot. This is a highly effective combination for fast aiming at close quarters.
Trigger action is exceptional. The DAO trigger travels smoothly through a 5/8 inch-long arc, with barely noticeable stacking just before it breaks. The trigger on my test sample breaks cleanly under 5-1/2 pounds of pressure. This compares very favorably with the 12-plus-pound trigger pulls most revolvers require in double-action firing.


RANGE TIME

I expected serious recoil from this lightweight .45, but was surprised at how easy the gun was to control. The bore line lies close to my shooting hand, significantly reducing muzzle flip. While smaller than that found on most .45s, the stippled grip fit my hand very nicely. A firm, two-handed hold made the gun remarkably easy to shoot. The operating manual contains a paragraph that reads: “ The KAHR Pistol must run through an initial break-in period before achieving fully reliable feeding and functioning. The pistol should not be considered fully reliable until after it has fired 200 rounds.”
Ignoring this caveat, the little CW45 chewed through everything I put through it, feeding and firing without a single bobble. During the first firing session, the gun digested more than 250 rounds of mixed ammunition—that’s remarkable performance for any auto pistol right out of the box. I already own way too many guns, but I was beginning to have second thoughts about returning the CW 45 to Kahr when the consignment period ends.
With the butt rested on sandbags, the little .45 delivered stellar accuracy—particularly from a defensive handgun primarily designed for concealed carry. A variety of 170- to 230-grain factory loads delivered 25-yard groups averaging from 2.75 to 3.60 inches across. My best five-shot group using Black Hills 230-grain full-jacketed (ball) loads measured just 2.4 inches between centers. I was impressed by the ergonomics of this little gun. It nestled nicely in my hand, and the narrow 1-inch slide had tapering cuts along the top and at the muzzle end. The smooth-faced trigger was situated so I could comfortably use the tip of my finger or the first joint to fire the gun.
The sights were easy to see, and could be quickly lined up on target. If you couldn’t see the square-shaped rear sight notch, you simply placed the while front dot over the while line on the rear sight, then tripped the trigger. The rear sight is drift-adjustable for windage, while the front blade is pinned permanently in place.
Reliable, accurate and easy to carry (concealed or openly on your belt), Kahr’s CW .45 offers bigbore firepower in a surprisingly small package. The 1911A1 pistols I own weigh nearly twice as much and have considerably greater bulk. I love my 1911s, but this Lilliputian .45 ACP is tempting me to reach for my checkbook. Believe me when I say I don’t test many guns that have that affect on me."

Absolutely no issues with the gun I just prefer a 9mm (I already have a P99AS full size in 9mm).  Comes with 3 Factory Mags and hard case.  I can email or text pictures.  Must have permit/CCW and be willing to do a bill of sale.

The SW99c is basically the same gun as a Walther P99c.  Walther makes the frame and internals for the SW99c in Germany, then SW makes the barrel and slide in the US.  The AS trigger provides SA only if you want, SA assisted, DA and one of the shortest resets you can find.  It has a decocker also.  All of these options are made into the trigger system so NO work/tools etc is needed.  Here is the basics on the trigger weight:

SA mode = 4.4lbs
DA mode = 8.8lbs
Reset = .25""

Here's how it works: The Super Bantam™ features a standard 12"" length of pull (one full inch shorter than the standard Bantam™) and it comes with an innovative stock spacer and extra rubber recoil pad to bring the synthetic stock to 13"" overall. When the shooter is ready for a full-sized length of pull, (14""+) just turn in the certificate that came in the box, for a full 50% off the price of the full-sized stock.

I love the beretta and the wife loves it even more but  I want something that looks more aggressive rather than just cool..and since i have 2 of the handguns the wife will still be happy..this is a name brand Beretta so I'm not looking for cheap Chinese knock off ....I have just under 600.00 invested in the gun,scope and carbine conversion kit so if you want to make a cash offer keep that in mind.Go check out the Beretta NEOS...its a real unique gun.Also..both the gun and carbine kit come in their original boxes with all the paper work gun lock and 2 magazines.Keep in mind that this is actually TWO guns in one..A pistol and a long distance shooting riffle all in one."

Up for sale today is my 1903 Springfield ""project"" rifle.  I have had this for a couple years, and have lost interest in it.

It is a Springfield 1903 barreled action (barrel date 4-42 S-A), with a Boyd's unfinished walnut stock.  I have a Williams Foolproof peep sight for it, as well at a vintage Lyman 17XNA (it fits the front-sight dovetail).  My intention was to turn this into a target rifle, so I got quality parts for it.

The barrel is in great shape.  All the components are there; the metal needs to be sandblasted & refinished, the stock finished, and it would be ready to assemble.

Thanks for looking  Feel free to ask questions.  Asking $350 obo; no trades at this time.

Target hammer, trigger and beautiful smooth Rosewood target grips. Original blue finish is very nice showing the typical turn line on cylinder and holster wear at muzzle which has been touched up. I have owned this revolver since the early 70's and I'm the second owner. It is an excellent shooter, with a smooth as silk trigger. The Early “S” prefix 57’s were S&W top of the line revolver along with the model 29 and first year sales of the 41 magnum were not great for S&W making this a somewhat difficult N frame revolver to find. Bore is in excellent condition. I would prefer an outright sale, but would possibly consider a trade for a 5"" model 629."

Weight:0.88kg
Length:41cm
Usage Focusing
Look through scope within 3 or 4 inch distance from your eyepiece lens. If you cant's see the reticle clearly, loosen knurled lock ring and rotate eye bell until the reticle appears clearest. Then screw the lock ring the eye bell firmly.
Mounting
Rotate scope tube so that vertical crosshair is vertical and horizontal crosshair is horizontal. Adjust the position of scope on the rifle so that proper eye relief is achieved. Then tighter all screws to fix scope on the rifle firmly.
Boresighting
Aim at a target 100m away and fire at it. If the impact point deviates from the aiming point, measure the vertical and horizontal distance between these two points. Screw off upper and right hand wheel covers of the scope and turn two hand wheels in the direction. Keep on firing and adjusting until the impact point coincide with the aiming point.
Maintenance
Keep scope in the place free from acid, alkaline and other corrosives. Dust and dirt on the surface of scope should be cleaned with soft cloth or soft tissue with a little alcohol."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Back in the heyday of the TV Western, Steve McQueen, the star of ""Wanted: Dead or Alive,"" rode across black-and-white screens toting a sidearm like nothing any lawman or outlaw had carried before. A cut-down, modified version of repeating rifle, this recognizable shootin’ iron could be holstered like a pistol but fired with the speed of lever-action rifle. Nicknamed the Mare’s Leg, this innovative weapon swiftly brought outlaws to justice every week and rose to fame as the real star of the short-lived show. Now fans of those classic Westerns and collectors of innovative firearms can holster a replica of that famous made-for-TV sidearm.

This is NOT the rifle version of the Model 100. It is the more expensive Carbine version. It is a fine hunting gun that I used recently to drop a 335 lb Missouri Wild Hog in its tracks. You can't do better than that with a 308 !
