******** ATTENTION!************

I would just like to say, THIS IS NOT CRAIGSLIST!!!  Did you bother to read the ad before you clicked on the link?  I AM A DEALER!  Why the **** would I sell you a brand new gun for $50 less than what I paid?  If you cant afford it, why are you shopping?  If you think you can get it at a better price from someone that has it IN STOCK, GO ****ING BUY IT! You want a gun at cost? YOU SPEND THE MONEY AND WAIT 6 MONTHS FOR AN FFL!   Does my price include IL state tax?  Let me ask you... Does my ****ing ad state that it does?  NO!  Why?  BECAUSE PEOPLE FROM OUT OF STATE BY GUNS TOO!  Does my price include shipping?  Again, does my ****ing ad state that it does?  Why would I include shipping for Illinois buyers?  You're smart!  Its FUCKING idiots like you that fuck up the right to own a gun for the rest of us!  And yes asshole, I need a copy of your FOID, DRIVERS LICENSE and if you are a Chicago resident, A COPY OF YOU CITY PERMIT.  If you dont have a fucking FOID and live in IL, don't waste my time!  The next person that does is being reported to the ATF!

Lets put this in stone.  The price is FIRM, IL tax in my place of business is 7%, I accept POSTAL MONEY ORDERS ONLY and if you wish to pay by credit card, its a 3.5% fee.  Sorry, that doesnt go in my pocket.  Its your purchase and I feel no reason that I need to pay fees because YOU dont have the cash.  No, I will not take trades, however, I will offer you a fair price for your used guns, NO, I will not pay you retail price for you used gun nor will I pay you full value of it being used.  I have to list it which takes time out of my day especially dealing with the morons that email/call me and for that, I expect to make a dollar on it for my time.  If you have an issue with that, this is what we can do.  I need my bathroom remodeled.  Since I am not allowed to profit on my sales, I will buy all the materials for my bathroom, you come install it for me and I will sell you the gun at my cost.  Deal?  On your way over, swing past the grocery store and get everything on my shopping list and bring me 5 gallons of gas.  I'm on empty.  If they have any specials on Sam Adams, pick up a 12'er and we can put them down when you are done with bathroom.  Beer is on me."

I've been running ragged the last couple weeks putting this together, and don't want to sell...but something else has popped up. 

Carbine: Marlin Camp 9. Very nice little rifle. This one has beautiful metal/bluing but the stock has some finish wear. Nothing serious or detrimental. These are bringing a ton of money on Gunbroker, I invite you to search finished auctions. I'm not going to try and sell for that much to you guys though. Rifle will come with the factory 12 rd mag, a 10rd S&W mag, and a 30 rd mag (unknown maker). Of course, the mags from the pistol will interchange in the rifle so, there's more. Also, I've installed a brand new Blackjack recoil buffer and Wolf 16.5# recoil spring ($25). 

Pistol: very clean Smith and Wesson 5946. This is the DAO version of the 5906. Full size, all stainless steel. Older night sites, two 15 rd factory mags, one Mec-gar 10 rounder. Has recently been polished and shows very well. Pretty pistol. Will come with a hard case as well.

Only trade I would entertain is another 9mm pistol+cash. Odd to ask for a different 9mm...but figure someone may want this combo together. I'd split the pair up if nobody is interested in the combo, but would rather sell at the same time. 

GB auctions have the Camp 9 selling above $700. Nice 59 series pistols are $450ish with a couple factory mags. I'd sell the combo for an even $1000...firm.

Designed as a tactical shotgun from the ground up, the manual pump mode is to be used if you want to fire non lethal rounds (i.e. less powder and less blowback force) that dont contain enough charge to chamber another round via the blowback gases.

The cross bolt safety on this SPAS 12 is not present, but the lever safety at the front of the trigger guard is functional. This is common with these shotguns.

Taking this into consideration, I'm only asking $1500. 

This gun has a crisp trigger and comparatively low recoil due to its weight. This allows for a very high rate of fire while still being controllable for a semi-auto 12ga.

Hard case included.

 3 high capacity magazines ((1) 30 round Eagle and (2) 25+20 HC3R magazines) 
1 10 round factory magazine
 BSA red dot and mount (not shown in pictures)
 Ruger sling (not shown in pictures)

 I've never had a problem out of the rifle or magazines. It's in great shape and you must see it to truly appreciate the rifle. The high capacity magazines are a lot of fun. The HR3C magazines store 20 additional rounds in the magazine that can be input via a stripper clip to where reloading is done in a matter of seconds. No more sore fingers from loading the magazines (at least with these, not so much with the factory or Eagle mag). The Eagle magazine is an older one that doesn't have the problems the newer ones have. The factory magazine is great too. It really follows the lines of the rifle and is good for when you are hunting and don't want a banana magazine sticking out. 
All in all, this is a great rifle and good deal. I would not hesistate to buy this rifle and magazines to introduce new shooters to the sport or for someone looking to do some plinking / hunting. With this being an older 10/22 (better quality components), stainless, the value of the magazines and the red dot I feel $500 is a fair price for this rifle. Sure, you can get a lesser 10/22 cheaper, but you will be getting a blued barrel and plastic components."

This gun was made in November of 2012. I bought it at the beginning of December to replace a Sig Sauer .45 ACP that I had for home protection because the .45 was too much for my fiance to handle.

It never occurred to me that she's left handed when I bought this gun. And while the magazine release can be swapped to the other side, she has difficulty using the right handed controls because her hands are so small. So, I'm left to find a different solution.

It comes with:

- Sig Sauer SP2022 9MM
- Original 15rd Magazine
- 2 x NEW Sig Sauer 15rd Magazines
- Original Literature
- Both Backstraps
- Like New Pistol Case w/ Mag Holders & Pouches

I no longer have the original box for this gun because Sig now ships them in a cardboard box that does not hold up. Thus, I am including the case I replaced it with.

Also, if you've shopped these magazines, you'll know they're out of stock everywhere online and are going for about $100 on eBay.

The gun has had about 200rds through it since I bought it in December. It's in clean, like new condition.

 Here is the deal. The Sig I have listed is worth more or the same as an M1A. This is why I want to trade. With the crazy prices out there I would have to ask  $2800.00 to get enough to buy an equal M1A. So If you want it for around that much, so be it. Otherwise find a as new lightly used, or new M1A and I will trade strait up. This is the best way to get what I want, and for you to get what you want.Thank you for understanding.
