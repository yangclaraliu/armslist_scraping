Is the pending Assault Weapons Ban making you nervous? Well, I have your answer. I build burial tubes at a fraction of the costs on the web. You tell me the length and width you want, I build it, and although not necessary I paint it with camouflage green and black. 

I also include instructions on how to seal, pack, and prepare your contents for the long underground stay. I also provide suggestions and strategies to bury your tube while keeping prying eyes from seeing where you bury your valuables. 

These suggestions come from years of experience, USMC military training, and some things I have learned along the way. Buying the tube is one thing, but knowing how to pack and prepare each item you intend to bury is just as important, if not more important than the tube you bury them in.  

Uses for burial tubes include:
-gun storage
-gun burial
-preparedness supplies
-emergency caching
-gun transportation and travel
-boating
-burying money, coins
-hiding documents, valuables
-ammunition

Will ship anywhere in the country and I can make this easy, $2.00 per inch for 48"" x 6"" tubes for $90 before shipping.

Other Sizes Available:
- 48"" x 10""
- 48"" x 12"" 

Prices vary on 10"" an 12"" diameters- just send me an email let me know what length and diameter you want and will respond with prices. 

If you follow my instructions I guaranteed these tubes will be water Proof, air tight, moisture proof, and ready to protect your valuables at a fraction of the costs. This tube gives you piece of mind you'll have your things when you need them. 

I also will sell waterproof bags to place your contents in before placing your items in the tube. Ask me about the simple customized solutions based on what you want to bury.

Please note that I put a lot of time and effort to ensure these are able to protect your valuables. Each tube takes approximately 5-7 days to make."

It is an Early Chinese type 56 carbine. It has all matching parts and a chrome lined barrel. This Chinese SKS was sold under contract to the Albanian government It was made in Chinese factory 66, and has worn bluing. Despite its rough appearance the Chinese is in impeccable mechanical condition and everything but the internal box magazine is milled. This rifle was made by angry Chinese people for angry Chinese people, It has better build quality than the Norincos that you will find around. the rifle has a little bit of surface rust on the bolt carrier and the stock is quite used.  I am fairly firm on the price because of current market conditions. I can meet you in the Parking lot of a public place to do the transaction.

A Glock 18 magazine for use in a Glock 17 could be described as high capacity or an AR drum that holds more than 30 rounds.

The term ""Hi Cap"" is a word that the left wants to use for any magazine that holds more than 10 rounds and you are just giving them more power when you start using their made up words such as ""Assault Weapon"" and ""Hi Cap"".

The DPMS Panther A3 Lite 16 could be the perfect semi automatic AR-15 rifle. A 16"" lightweight barrel, 30 round detachable magazine and the fabulous DPMS Pardus collapsible buttstock are just some of the highlights of this black anodized beauty.

Whether you are buying your first AR-15 rifle, or need a simple and effective carbine, the DPMS A3 Lite 16 is for you. This carbine earns its name with its 16"" light profile barrel, A3 style flat top upper receiver, and 6-position collapsible stock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.5 lbs. The simple A3 upper receiver, with its built-in picatinny rail, allows for the addition of almost any sighting optic you can imagine. The 16"" barrel although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. And the collapsible stock makes this carbine very handy and compact.

Stamped Kjobenhavns Toiuus 1883 behind hammer. Includes cleaning rod. According to my research it looks like this rifle was modified by the Danes in later years to accept a second firing pin (for center fire cartridges)when these rifles were issued to their version of the Coast Guard---hence the rather large 3-1/4"" tall rear sight. Stock is stamped with number 63666 just ahead of the rear sling mount, and there appears a rectangle stamp on top of the stock with the initials 'G.C.'. Blueing on barrel rates at least an 8, and receiver has a 'case hardened' look that is rather pretty. All in all this is simply a great looking antique rifle with a cool history. And just in time for Valentine's Day"

This rifle has only been shot about 200 times so it's not even broken in yet!  The gas-piston makes it run really smooth and without any recoil and keeps the receiver clean.

This is the predecessor to the notorious Intratec TEC-9/DC9/AB-10 models and was designed by Interdynamic AB of Sweden.

Unfortunately as you can see it is damaged and should be carefully inspected by a professional gunsmith before a single round is put through it. The frame is cracked at the magazine well and receiver pin hole. The action works, the magazines fit and the firing mechanism does strike but that's as far as I will take it.

I personally have never fired this gun so I can't say if it is safe so I am selling it to the highest bidder and once it's yours, if it breaks in half you own both halves. 

***THIS GUN IS BEING SOLD FOR REPAIR/PARTS ONLY DUE TO OBSERVED DAMAGE TO THE FRAME***

It could be used as a parts gun or rebuilt and fired after inspection but it is 101% up to the buyer to determine it's ability to be *safely* fired.

Price is listed at $250 just to have a figure there. Make an offer!
