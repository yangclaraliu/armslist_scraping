The Workman™ allows the wearer to completely conceal a small to medium size pistol or revolver without wearing a vest or other outer garment over it. A leather extension allows the wearer to tuck his shirt completely over the weapon and holster. Attachment to the belt is accomplished by a loop either with or without a snap. The snap is provided to allow a key ring or other such item to be placed on the loop to disguise the loop's true purpose. The stitched-on loop is the same construction as on the ARG™. For the most dedicated, we offer a hook and loop attachment with matching parts to be sewn into the waistband. With snug-fitting pants, a belt is unnecessary. (Original design concept for the Workman is credited to Dave Workman.)"

The rifle is a 27th series Type 99 made by Tokyo Juki Kogyo in late 1944 or early 1945. These are interesting rifles in that the craftsmanship compared to earlier Japanese rifles is quite a bit more rough. These ""last ditch"" rifles have only a simple peep sight, welded barrel bands, a wooded butt plate, no upper handguard, and very rough machining on the receiver, stock, and various metal parts.

These rifles are a great representation of the huge pressure Japan was under at the end of World War 2 due to US bombings of the mainland and lack of resources.

This rifle is a typical example of a US serviceman bring back from the end of World War 2. The Imperial mum is ground off the rifle (this was done at the end of the war, as the mum was a symbol of the Emperor) and the firing pin and safety do not match the rest of the rifle. This was probably because GI's had to make their rifle inoperable when on the ship home. Upon arriving home they collected new parts out of a bin of parts. The bolt body and extractor do match.

The bore appears unfired and is shinny with strong grooves. This rifle was probably somewhere in mainland Japan at the end of the war when the GI took it home.

I'm asking $200 for this rifle, since it's a pretty standard late war Type 99. Please don't be afraid to make me an offer. I might even trade it for different WWII era Japanese rifles or other military surplus rifles. If you'd like more photos or have any questions, please ask!

Tannerite is a binary explosive used primarily as a target for firearms practice, and is unique in that it is exceptionally stable when subjected to less severe forces such as a hammer blow or being dropped. It is supplied as two powders which are combined to produce the explosive. Tannerite is a trademarked name, and binary exploding targets are a patented invention. 

Tannerite is not flammable (it is an oxygen robber and will extinguish fire). When the bullet penetrates the mixed powders, the molecules separate and cause a molecular breakdown which in turn causes a sonic boom and water vapor to appear in the air. 

Since the two components are not explosive until mixed, they can legally be purchased and used in the USA without any kind of license.

One of the Taurus USA top executives was at Colt for many years, privy to all Colt inside manufacturing knowledge on this gun. The Taurus also incorporates many custom features.

Truck is solid with a good body, even has valet keyless system on the vehicle but no key fob.  Story goes the front differential went out on the truck, Toyota wanted LOTS to repair at the dealer, owner said forget it and left it to a friend and moved away... never got around to giving the guy the title.  I purchased it from that fella without a title, just a bill of sale, will provide bill of sale with purchase/trade so you can get a title bond on it if you end up so inclined.  Should be able to get a title bond from talking to the folks at the DMV and tag offices both, (THEY WERE HELPFUL!!) and get it on the road or this would be a PERFECT off road project!  If you go the off-road toy route you could strip the truck of many parts and help fund your build... the rear leather seats are worth a bit, and if you're going extreme and doorless you've got doors with switches, etc you could part out as well.  I priced out a front differential at like $450 for a used one if you wanted to fix things.  Transmission and Motor supposed to be in good order, wasn't cranked for a while before I got it, think the fuel pump went out while it was sitting (notorious on Toyotas that sit for a long while).  Interior would clean up good, needs front seats recovered or some seat covers or something.  Back seats (leather) and 3rd row seats look good with no tears or rips.  Tires have some decent tread but are older.  Great project truck or parts truck, TONS worth of parts here... from all the good body panels, to the leather back seats, motor, trans, rear diff, etc!  Sunroof (works) several power windows I think didn't... one or two... I tested them.  Honestly the fuel pump may be fine and I just don't know how the dern security system works... it has a power cut switch that isn't marked so I could be totally confused or missing something there.  I haven't spent much time on this thing, I've got a lot of projects right now!  Oh, and I think the windshield has a crack and the hood has a dent from a limb that hit the corner... only bad body panel I think at all.  It needs TLC to make it road worthy again, thus the low price... 180 something thousand miles... nothing bad for these motors.  Would consider partial trade on nice firearms, decent size good safe for long guns, cash, gold, or silver."

These are as hot as it gets right now and trying to find one is imossible.  S&W is backed up 6-8 months so by the time they ship the prices will have gone up for the new year.

One just went up to $680 plus shipping on August 2nd on Gunbroker and still did not meet the $800 reserve.

I have 2 mosin nagants, my M91-30 and my M44 and haven't been using my M91-30 because my primary hunting rifle is the M44 because of it's size. And the fact I never go much beyond 200 yards when shooting, so the added barrel length of my m91/30 isn't beneficial even though it's a tackdriver. 

I've gone through it many many times, there is no more cosmoline in this rifle - it's clean as a whistle. The bore is excellent, I've never shot corrosive ammo through and it I am very meticulous when it comes to the care of my guns.  Also, I've performed a very simple trigger smoothing job along with some other odds and ends to help it's accuracy out. Open sights I can pull some dead ringers @100 yards easily.

It is in pretty good condition for its age. It shoots the 45/70 ammo. It appears to be all factory. I cant see anything on the gun that someone has tried to refinish. It says US Springfield on the side of the rifle and it says US MODEL 1884 on the receiver right behind the rear sight. It is really hard to see it but it is there. The bluing is all still there. The wood is in good shape. The cleaning rod is there. The bore is nice. It has 2 barrel rings. I have never fired the rifle but it looks like there would be no problems. The hammer cocks back nicely and it releases fine. This rifle is a great piece of american history and would be a great piece for someones collection. I am looking to trade for a nice carry pistol. Im looking for a colt defender or a kimber ultra carry 2. Let me know what you have and lets see if we can work out some sort of a deal. If you have any questions or want to see pics please feel free to ask. Thanks!"

I took this in trade awhile back thinking I might like it but I have short stubby fingers and really need a single stack 9 (skinny grip). After handling it I could see its too big for me. I know you can buy it for 374.18 tax and all but why would you when you can have this fine pistol for 50 bucks less and it is still brand new, plus this would be FTF sale private party transaction. I would take it back but once it has had an FBI sale check they call it used! So here is a great deal and I'll just find a single stack smaller gripped one. These are supposed to be great shooters, the Army ordered 6500 of them for tank crew. So I'd say it is a reliable weapon if the Army buys them.

This pistol is easily the most accurate I have ever owned including Nighthawks, Wilson, and Ed Brown.

This firearm is built on a Caspian frame and slide, match barrel, custom stippling on the grip, very comfortable walnut grips, commanderized hammer, beaver tail grip safety and the trigger breaks like glass.  In the first picture is the first target that I shot freehand at 12 yrds.  These guns are $5500 new.  I prefer cash so that gets the best deal, $2699 shipped to your FFL.
