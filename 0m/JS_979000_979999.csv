I bought this used from a bulk-lot of guns being retired from duty-carry by a police department.  There is some corresponding wear but the pistol works and fires just fine.  It is the first 1911 style pistol I've owned and I've realized that I don't like the platform.  The pistol comes with two mags and absolutely nothing else.  The pistol is equipped with night sights but they are pretty dim.

6-shot.  
You've maybe read about these.  Fire off the bottom chamber.  Looks very cool, futuristic.  And also works with your body to deliver the recoil back directly on axis with your arms, reducing the flip and feel of the recoil, and allowing you to get back on target quickly for follow-up shots.
Fiber-optic front sight.  Rails on top and bottom, and yes...  you did see this gun in the new movie remake of Total Recall, along side the Kriss Vector.  Comes with Moon clips (shown).
Feel free to contact with questions.

Will ship out of state (save sales tax) to another licensed FFL to do the transfer."

I'd pay up to $80 per 8 lb. jug (i.e. WC857 or similar) with the slower burning jugs at $55 (i.e. WC872, 860, or similar)  Yes, I'm offering about what anyone would have paid for it lately OR LESS a few years back.  I would also trade 2 - 3 lbs of canister (H4831sc, H4350, IMR4831) for a full milsurp keg (depending on what you have and want).  

I'd ALSO go in on a SIX (6) keg milsurp powder order with anyone in Topeka/Emporia area for three to four kegs for myself (if you'd take at least two) and we could avoid the hazmat fees.  I've spoken with GIBrass (Jeff) and he has stock on these right now at $48 to $72 per 8 lb keg.  I just don't want to buy SIX kegs for myself, but this is the minimum order to get the hazmat fee waved.  These would come to me and I'd meet face-to-face with you for your share of the powder and actual final cost (keg price plus shipping-- divided by the number of total kegs bought; in cash).  We'd meet halfway or I'd come to you if not to far off the beaten path within a week of getting it (in Topeka or Emporia). I would not open it until we met and we'd each pick from the lot.

If anyone wants to split an order, we could get this powder for a little over $7 a lb SHIPPED (a little more for the WC857 types).  H4832 and H4350 is going for $32 a lb locally right now-- that's over FOUR times the powder for the same money (when you figure taxes in).  Oh... and let us not forget... you CAN'T GET the bulk canisters right now-- it's sold out nationwide for the better priced bulk canisters.

Hoping a kind old reloader (or a grumpy old guy works too) will be happy to make a few bucks off a keg or two- or move stuff getting old and needing to be shot.  If after another week I find no sellers, I'll be ready to split an order with a ready partner.  BUT there is a FOUR week delay on orders (even with Jeff, but at least he WILL ship it as he DOES have stock).

I'm not interested in any mixed lots IF over a keg is offered up- single lot only please and I'd take anything similar to the list above (that can be looked up and would work about the same, maybe a bit faster-- but not slower).  I'd need at least one jug (8 lbs) to buy and only have enough canister to trade for ONE jug-- but I could add cash for more than one jug if you want the canisters too.  I'm not interested in ""hot"" powders or pistol powder or selling any canister powder of my own-- trade or buy only and thank you."

1) a Stripped receiver (so you can assemble it INTO a pistol)
OR
2) a PISTOL AR15 Lower receiver
OR
3) NO AR15 -AT ALL- and plan to buy a receiver to be made into a pistol
OR
4) A Registered Short Barreled Rifle Registered With the NFA with the Tax stamp.
(if you don't know what this last one is, you do NOT have it, they aren't easy to get and the wait is very long).

If you do not have one of the above, I will NOT sell this to you, period.

I'm selling it with 2 magazines, and about 200-250 rounds of .22LR

I WILL NOT SELL THE AMMO SEPERATELY, Period.

If you are one of the people who bought a lower that has never been assembled as a rifle, I can show you how to LEGALLY own this.

Firearms Return Policy: 
VERY IMPORTANT - Please take your time to inspect all firearms thoroughly before proceeding with the firearms transfer process. Once a new firearm is transferred to you it is considered used, even if unfired. Consequently, we cannot provide a full refund for new firearms once they have been transferred into your possession. Also, we DO NOT reimburse FFL transfer fees on cancelled or refused firearms. We do understand that some manufacturer defects may not be identifiable upon initial inspection. However, upon discovering a defect after the transfer, the firearm must be returned directly to the manufacturer for replacement or repair (in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty policy). By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

New In Box 

    Lightweight Design - At 4.2 pounds, this is the lightest gas piston upper on the market and the lightest railed upper we've found.
    Lightweight Low-profile gas piston system.
    Lightweight melonite coated barrel. Melonite coating is significantly harder than chrome lining, providing much longer barrel life and improved accuracy from tighter coating tolerances. Melonite coating also improves muzzle velocity by over 100FPS.
    Competition muzzle brake significantly reduces recoil for faster follow up shots.
    Evo extended rail allows you to bolt on rails where you need them, and maintain the comfort of a smooth rail where you don't. The rail extends around the new low-profile gas block, giving you nearly 12"" of usable rail space.

Its hard not to get very upset with people and harder to comprehend how you can shop for a high dollar rifle with no money or call a beat to death pistol new. We shall try it one last time. If you respond, then all I ask is you follow up with your inquiries and be ready to purchase with funds in hand. If you want to work a trade then your pistols or rifle must be in the same condition as mine! Just some courtesy and mutual respect.

The AK 47 was custom built when Lancaster was just a pup and known for some of the best AK 47s on the market. Original Hammer Forged Chrome Lined Barrel. DCI receiver considered one of the finest on the market. All numbers matching. The furniture is amazing and totally refinished to perfection. The AK is also finished with Melonite finish.
I have three original steel 30 round mags and two ProMag 73 round drums that are USA made and the best drums I have found period and backed for life by Pro Mag. I have 100 rounds of Winchester 123gr. FMJ brass cased 7.62 x 39 rounds and 18 boxes of TulAmmo 7.62 x 39. The attention to detail on this AK is what stand out the most. She is tight and everything comes together very well. She is also streamlined and has a beautiful stance. There is a lot of junk out there for big money and many AKs are boxy with ugly furniture. This one is truly beautiful and flawless."

I'm not really looking to sell this pistol as much as I'm looking for an interesting trade. Currently I'm interested primarily in long guns.

I'm also open to SBRs (short barrel rifles). I might also consider some super cool shotgun (Saiga 12, serbu shorty etc)

I'm in no rush to get rid of this piece, nor do I have any motivation to do so other than (as I said) an interesting trade. Let me know what you have, and maybe we can come to an agreement. I'm not really interested in adding any cash to the deal unless you have something like a KRISS carbine in which case obviously I'd add a little extra cash.

The .40S&W Sigs are DAK (double action only) with tactical rail and 1 12-round mag and these are in excellent condition.   The 9mm Sigs come with 1-15 round mag and show a bit more wear, but are in excellent mechanical condition.   These Sigs do NOT have the magazine release safeties (they can fire with the magazine removed) and are probably not legal in California. 

$550 for the .40S&W and $600 for the 9mm.   Add $25 for shipping to your FFL; for local pick-up, add sales tax and $25 NICS."
