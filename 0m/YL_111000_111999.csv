Steyr SBS Tactical rifle, low round count, in excellent condition 
Cold-hammer forged barrel is 20-inch, lightweight profile 
Chambered in 308WIN 
Bolt handle is a ball-shape, very easy to operate 
Magazine is 5 is rounds, can be converted to 10-round setup with optional part. Magazine has two positions: full-in and slightly-out, to strip out a round but not grab the next one. 
Stock is composite with removable spacers for adjusting the length of pull. 
Trigger is a typical Steyr, slight travel to the rear and crisp, light break. Awesome. 

Safety deserves it's own paragraph, thats why they call this gun SBS, Safe Bolt System. Safety has three positions, Fire, Safe and Safe+Lock. When the safe+lock position is on, bolt handle can be locked down, so you can't accidentally strip out a round if snagged on something. In that position, the firing pin comes out of alignment so there is no chance of accidental discharge. To fire from that position, roll the safety all the way to Fire, the bolt handle comes up, and you are ready to fire. Very well-thought-out system. 

Rifle comes with sling swivels that can be quick-detached by pressing them in and twisting. Excellent design. 

Leupold standard bases are installed and the buyer will have an option to purchase a Leupold Rifleman 3-9x40 scope that was mounted on this fine rifle. 

Here is a good review of the same rifle: http://www.remtek.com/arms/steyr/sbs/index.htm 

Enough describing, here is the price: $800 without the scope and $990 with the scope."

I'm not particularly interested in long guns as this time, but I'll listen to any offers. This is a really nice pistol, and has been reliable for me. I don't have to get rid of this, so don't be offended if I refuse. Any questions, let me know, thanks.

:DISCLAIMER:
I have run into some concerns from people about this upper. I do have a C&R FFL , and the lower that this came off of is a BATF registered SBR(Short Barreled Rifle)($200 tax stamp) You can buy this for an AR-15 pistol (it must be stamped as 5.56 PISTOL  on your RCVR) or if you have a registered SBR lower. It is your responsibility to know the laws. It is legal to sell this but you need to be informed about what you are buying, and the ramifications of getting caught using this in an irresponsibile and illegal way."

One of the P series of centerfire semi-automatic pistols made by Sturm, Ruger & Company. They were designed for military, police, civilian self defense and recreational use. The designs are largely based on the Browning action found in the M1911 pistol, but with minor variations, generally related to the safety mechanism and the barrel-camblock interface. Gun is extremely rugged and reliable.  It has the de-cocker on the side so there is no manual safety. Gun comes with original box and paperwork, 2 X 15 round magazines and a Hogue grip installed. I'm the original owner of this firearm.  Approximately 800 FMJ factory ammo down range.

Or in the long single action, or in the short single action, and at anytime there is a de-cocker located on top of the slide. The de-cocker is very easy to operated with either hand and the magazine release is also ambidextrous and very much like the H&K USP's mounted on both sides at the rear of the trigger guard. I like using my right index finger to operate the mag release and my off hand thumb to operate the de-cocker. The pistol also incorporates a firing pin block that is only released at the full depression of the trigger. S&W is the manufacturer of the slide & barrels and Walther is the maker of the frames on the S&W SW99 series pistols. To date S&W is the only company to manufacture this pistol design in the 45 ACP.

This 1911 is made for IPSC or IDPA shooting, or for defense. It features low-profile 3 dot combat sights. The rounded edges on the sights won't snag clothing.

The rounded edges on this stainless pistol are bead-blasted, while the flat areas are shiney, giving it a really striking look. Cocobolo hardwood grips round out the pistol's appearance.

An ambidextrous safety makes this 1911 easy for left-handed shooters to use, as well as making it easier for righties to shoot weak-handed.

Like all Springfield Armory 1911's, this one has a skeletonized trigger with overtravel adjustment, and a barrel bushing for fast takedown.

With all of these features, plus a lifetime warranty, and a relatively low price, what's not to like?

P-3AT (Custom Billfold Brown Color)
The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety."

The G19 has TruGlo Night Sights installed and 3 1/2 lb trigger. Comes with original box and packaging. Low round count. Bought a while back but has simply been stored for a while. I've taken it to the range a few times in recent months and it hasn't given me a single problem.

I have FIVE 15 round mags with it. Also have THREE 17 round mags. PLUS I have THREE 33 round mags. 

You get all of this for $600 bucks. I am thinking $400 for the Glock 19 Gen 3 plus $15 each for the REGULAR mags. Then $20 each for the 33's. Not bad, huh?

Fair price I think. You get everything you need to be prepared for anything! This is a money saver considering each mag usually costs $25 new. Used, I rarely pay less than $20. So, let me know if you want it! I will meet AROUND Birmingham area!"

It is rare because of the Gold Lettering on it which was a special order from Colt. Last show I went to, dealer told me that the original grips alone were worth $150. I'm really not interested in selling it as I would rather trade, but if you feel the need to make me an offer, I will consider it.

There are exactly 36 rounds down the tube which were used to break in the barrel and sight in the scope.

The only blemish is on the scope where it was initially mounted too far forward, and there's a small ring on the bell from changing the magnification. It does NOT affect function at all, and you could probably use a sharpie to make it completely vanish.
