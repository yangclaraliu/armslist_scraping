(This is straight off Diamondback's website)
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380, a micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magaine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. 

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

In my opinion this is the only Taurus worth owning. Taurus bought the Beretta factory in Brazil and the PT92 is made on the same machinery as the world famous Beretta 92. Taurus upgraded the design by adding a frame mounted safety/decocker; this greatly improves the ergonomics of the pistol.

Item/set-up was taken out of my Chevy Suburban. In Full working order with exception of a 12vdc neon tube inside the enclosure (can be replaced with ease and minimal cost). Also including remote Bass Boost module for the amp (lighted knob kind), - you will need a double mono 1/8 end cable to plug it in . As you see, there was no expense spared on this stereo (everything was purchased BRAND NEW), Amp was $800 shipped, Enclosure was $750+$150 shipping due to size/weight and capacitor was $200. So, not including all the terminals and wires, spare fuse and Bass Boost module This set-up was $1900. As you see from the pics, there are over $120 in wires and high end voltage distribution hardware. I ran this set-up via 0ga DC cables, second dedicated Optima Yellow Top Battery with upgraded to 130AMP Bosch alternator and Battery Isolator (none listed are included) as this is a power house and, obviously draws some juice. Capacitor helps big time, thus was added into the initial installation mix from the beginning and proved to be a huge value. Any questions, shoot me an email."

I bought it a couple of years ago for a vacation drive to Idaho. Afterward I put it aside in my office and promptly forgot about it. Basically it is ''as new''. Everything shipped with the unit is included. 
Honestly this thing saved me in fines more that I paid or it during my one and only trip. I loved the accuracy that it offered and the piece of mind was priceless. More scans are available.

From the Manufacturer
The Passport 8500 has been hailed as the most revolutionary radar/laser detector ever. Now, Escort is raising the bar again. The Passport 8500 X50, the next generation of the 25-year-old favorite, is the most advanced and sophisticated radar and laser detector ever. The Passport 8500 X50's V-tuned radar receiver provides extreme detection range on all police radar, conventional radar, and ""instant-on"" radar, including the new POP X band mode, and up to 50 percent more range than the original Passport 8500 on the all-important K and Ka bands. In addition, the detector's digital signal processing (DSP) provides maximum range with minimum false alarms. The unit also includes a patented AutoSensitivity mode that intelligently distinguishes real threats from other known sources of radar, virtually eliminating false readings.

Passport 8500 X50's multiple high-performance laser sensors provide maximum police radar (lidar) warning, with superior off-axis protection. The detector also offers three high-resolution meter modes--a standard bar graph, exclusive ExpertMeter, and SpecDisplay. In ExpertMeter mode, the Passport 8500 X50 can identify band and relative signal strength on up to eight radar signals simultaneously, while with SpecDisplay, the Passport 8500 X50 will show you the actual frequency of the radar signal. Adding to the unit's versatility is a reprogrammable microprocessor, which can be re-worked to detect new radar and laser threats."

This is the same as the Overland model, but it was before they put that name on them. This has apparently seen very little use as it locks up tight and the wood and metal are in as-new condition. It does, however, look like the toe of the butt plate has cracked and then been repaired.

This is only the second Rossi that I've seen that has silver triggers, hammers, and lever. In addition, this has factory installed sling swivels that I've only ever seen on one other Rossi. These older Rossis have nicer wood than the more recent ones. It is nice and dark with some finish on it. A four-digit, S-prefix, serial number attests to its early production. A very nice Rossi.

As with all Rossi coach guns, there are no extra, unnecessary, safties. These are great guns, and this early one is a great find.

Price is $525.00, plus $30 shipping and insurance."

Might trade for AR, AK, FAL, G3, Mini-14 or other military type platform rifles.

Will not trade straight across for a century/WASR AK without quite a bit of ammo.( I don't care if you put a bunch of Tapco or an NC-Star on it, it doesn't make your $400 rifle worth more just because you put a chinese optic and some plastic on it.)

Also not interested in polymer receiver ARs.

Willing to trade up or down, with the appropriate amount of cash going either way, or you could always just buy it.

If you a gun other than what's listed shoot me an offer the worst I can say is no. 

If it shoots I'm usually into it. I don't do much deer hunting though, so I'm not into most gun chambered in the more common deer cartridges(.243/.270 etc.)

Will post pics later.

$850 trade or $750 cash

Also have a Taurus 917C, with IWB holster, and about half a box of ammo, $350.

Might be willing to trade both for the right rifle."

This rifle is in good shape with bit of blueing rubbed down in the normal spots, from being a carried gun. It has the micro grooved barrel, which is like new, great rifling, bore is great! the only problem with this gun is the back of the stock needs refinished, the poly has worn off,,but it is just on the stock from 6"" back,,,if not sold by tues then I will just redo the stock and bump the price up.

Smooth shooting, accurate, fun to shoot. The holster is basically new, still very tight, needs to be worn in. The Hi-Viz sight helps a lot and won’t fade with time like Tritium. There is a small gap between the Hi-Viz and slide but you can hardly tell and it does not really effect functionality. The mag release is ambidextrous, but I find it easer to use my right middle finger to release the mag from the right side rather than shift my grip and use the thumb on the left side.  $350 shipped CONUS to your FFL or $300 FTF in CT w/ valid pistol permit.

This ALL WHEEL DRIVE AUDI A-6 with the 4.2L V8 is longer and wider than the V6 models. The elegant, luxuriously trimmed interior of the A-6 provides ample room for five adults, and all are treated to comfortable seats. Wood trim on the doors, center console and dashboard add touches of warmth. The dashboard has attractive white-on-black gauges, with Audi's red instrument lighting, black leather interior, power seats, power adjust wheel, power windows, power locks, dual climate control w/ rear A/C, fully adjustable sunroof and visor. Audi says the A6's trunk holds 15.4 cubic feet of cargo, but it looks much larger than that. The cargo floor is wide and goes well forward, and the trunk opening is large enough to easily load bulky items. A6 4.2 has a 4.2-liter V-8 with 300 horsepower (when new), the same engine used in the A8 sedan.
Safety features are abundant. Besides the required front airbags, also has side-impact airbags for the front seats. Inflatable side curtains that protect the heads and upper bodies of all passengers are standard on the A6 4.2 and optional on the others. Anti-lock brakes are standard.

This is NOT a Winmag it's weatherby .300  mag only, as it says right on the barrel. I bought this off of a friend who was in need, and has since informed me that I am its permanent owner... I am more of a tactical firearms kind of guy so I have tried to list this weapon accurately. The sentence quotes below came right out of the ""Thirty First Edition of the Blue book for Gun values"". It sounded like good info on the weapon so I added it. Sorry for the picture quality I am more than willing to email addition (close up) pictures of any part of the weapon. 

 From book---""Includes many Mark V features, such as, one-piece fluted bolt with 3 gas ports, 2 locking lugs, and 90-degree bolt lift, 5 shot mag 24"" barrel, and adjustable trigger"".

It comes with everything pictured EXCEPT the sling
1)	The rifle
2)	The scope mounts are millet aluminum see thru 1"" Weaver.
3)	The scope = BSA Classic 3-12X50 w screw caps for both lenses
4)	An adjustable camouflaged sling with metal sling mounts.

Its a great gun, however the barrel is a little too long for my girlfriend to handle and as she regularly accompanies me to the range it seems a little selfish. Also the .45lc proved to be a little harder on my wallet than I originally anticipated. So I was wondering if anyone wanted to trade there Ruger New Model Blackhawk in .357 Mag with the 4 3/4"" barrel for mine. 

It will also come with a Hunter Company Slim Jim holster (right handed).

I have a Chinese ""paratrooper"" SKS I'm interested in trading. This is your basic SKS minus some of the length- a really handy, maneuverable rifle.
This rifle is in excellent shape, including crown and bore. I've put about 200 rounds downrange since I got it and have had no malfunctions of any kind.
This model has a ventilated upper handguard, a high vis front sight post, and a flush fit 5 round ""hunting"" magazine. I don't know how much of that is standard on this rifle. Came to me without the bayonet.
I have also put on a rubber buttpad. I still have the original steel one and will include it.
This rifle carries the ""26"" arsenal mark and the serials put it (I believe) somewhere in 1966 production.

I will also throw in two aftermarket mags, a Chinese bandoleer/chest rig, a sling, and some stripper clips with ammo.

I figure trade value at somewhere between 300 and 500 according to going rates on Gun Broker.
