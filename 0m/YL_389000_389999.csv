I have a Sile imported Norinco 56s AK-47 that I bought a couple of years ago and have never fired it.  The guy I bought it from said it had never been fired, and it appears that way.  I wrapped it up and put it away and its been like that ever since.  I bought it on an impulse, but I should have gotten a shooter instead of a collector.  I want to sell it to pay some bills and maybe find a cheap AK that I won't mind taking out and abusing.  This one is definitely a collector and they are hard to find. I know exactly what I have and I won't accept lowball offers.  It didn't come in the original box but it does come with the bayonet and sheath, sling, and 2 30rd mags. I'm asking $1,500 but I am willing to negotiate some.  I'd prefer a FTF sale in the Jackson area. If FTF I'll provide a bill of sale and I'll need a copy of your drivers license, but I can ship it from my FFL to yours if need be. If interested call or text Bobby at REDACTED.
Thanks for looking."

Overview:

Remington brought the hunting-rifle prowess, and a leading manufacturer of modular repeating rifles introduced us to the 308 Win platform. What emerged is a masterwork of game-dropping performance and hunt-specific features that will load any camp’s meat pole with unrivaled efficiency – the new Model R-25. An advanced, highly lethal blend of accuracy, fast followups and light recoil chambered for three of today’s most popular short-action hunting cartridges – 243 Win, 7mm-08 Remington and 308 Win. This rifle is everything varmint and predator hunters love about our R-15 in a beefed-up design that easily handles cartridges suitable for big-game hunting.
For peak accuracy, its precision-crafted 20"" ChroMoly barrel is freefloated within the machined aluminum fore-end tube. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block keep weight to a minimum and facilitate rapid heat dissipation. The barrel also features a recessed hunting crown to protect the rifling and aid in more consistent bullet flight. When it’s time to make the shot, the R-25’s ergonomic pistol-grip gives you unmatched control and rock-steady aim. As a whole, this rifle has a balanced, stable design that makes it deadly from the offhand position. True to our hunting market, the traditional two-stage trigger found on AR-platform rifles has been exchanged for a crisp, single-stage version that comes from the factory set at 4 1/2 to 5 lbs.
Its carefully tuned upper and lower are machined from rugged aluminum forgings. The entire gun is dressed in Mossy Oak® Treestand™ camo that makes it virtually invisible in the field. We included a 4-round magazine, and the R-25 is compatible with DPMS 308 Win-type magazines and accessories. front and rear sling swivel studs are installed.
Key Features:

    Semi-automatic AR-10-style rifle developed in conjunction with an industry leader in the category
    Free-floated button-rifled 0.680"" Muzzle OD ChroMoly barrels with recessed hunting crown for superior accuracy
    Fluted barrel design reduces weight and promotes rapid barrel cooling
    Clean-breaking single-stage hunting trigger (factory set to 4.5-5lbs)
    Receiver-length Picatinny rail for adding optics and accessories
    Ergonomic pistol grip for rock solid aiming and control
    Front and rear sling swivel studs
    Legal for hunting in most states
    Compatible with aftermarket DPMS 308 Win Magazine Boxes

The gun has about 150rds through it. It’s a great gun fun gun to target practice with I am just looking for something in a bigger caliber bolt/semi. Or round about $700 thats with everything i have invested in it.  I may consider other cash offers or half cash/trade for everything all five mags and three optics and the gun itself. Also the gun has a small scratch on the left side of the receiver that’s the way it was from the store and I’m sure there’s a few other scratches but nothing that messes with the gun its self as in firing or function. The gun works smooth as butter I like to say. And also I bought the gun about a month ago so its fairly new. I love it and would hate to see it go but I’m wanting a bigger caliber.

THIS gun is basically in perfect shape finish wise. The frame doesn't have mark on it! This is one of the SWEETEST shooting and ACCURATE guns you will ever own. It has the smoothest double action only trigger pull of any gun on the market. The DAK trigger system is amazing!!!!   

With the gun, holster, and ammo I have over $800 in the gun. So I am looking to get a trade value of close to the same. 

I will trade for something slim in size, maybe 1911 of some kind/ Kahr P 45 or P 40 prefered (must be LIKE NEW with NO WEAR!!!). I will also look into other slim single stack carry guns, prefer anyhting larger than 9mm in single stack.

2.      What are the benefits of the  NFA Trust over the Corporate and individual form of ownership?

a.      No filing fee or annual fee

b.      There are NO requirements that the Trust be filed with the Secretary of State

c.       The trust documents and the assets of the trust remain private. 

d.      No CLEO signoff, no photos, no fingerprints and NO BEGGING the government for permission to exercise your Second Amendment rights! 

e.      The ability of anyone who is a trustee to be able to lawfully possess the weapons.

Avoid alot of hassle and extra work. I can draw up a Firearms Trust in your name, so you can transfer your Class 3 intem, Silencer / Machingun into it. You still have to get a $200.00 TAX stamp from the ATF. But a Firearms Trust allows you to Avoid alot of steps.

 Without a Trust you will need Fingerprints, Background Check, and signoff of local police in your county that they allow you to have the class 3 item. THe firearms trust acts like a corporation. But beware many people prepare general trusts which are not the same. They can deny your Application.

 I charge $100.00 compeleted Firearms Trust. Once you obtain the trust you can with you ATF forms and standard $200 ATF fee. Apply for you transfer of the Class 3 item.

 Less steps and I give you all info you'll need simple, fast & no confusion

The Kahr PM9 3"" Micro pistol is a pocket powerhouse with a lot going for it, once it is broken in. It's small, light, concealable, snag resistant, thoroughly shootable and packs a considerable punch for such a diminutive gun. The PM is one of the few true pocket pistols and one of the most practical carry guns available. 

I'm looking for a small-to-midsize carry pistol chambered in .45ACP. I'm really interested in Glock G36. I don't want to trade down (i.e. Kel-Tec, Bersa, etc.). Looking for an equal trade here. 

I DO NOT WANT MONEY FOR THIS PISTOL--please do not email or text me with cash offers. FOR TRADE ONLY.

Thanks for looking!

Description from website:

The 45 Colt Critical Defense load has been maximized for performance in short-barreled platforms, and is a fantastic choice for the very popular Taurus Judge. Both the 44 SPL and the 45 Colt Critical Defense loads offer real “man-stopping” power.

Unaffected by thick and heavy clothing, including denim and leather. 
Patented FTX bullet delivers superior controlled expansion and large, deep wound cavities over a wide range of velocities. Clean burning and stable propellants reduce recoil in lightweight handguns, and perform consistently in all temperatures. 
Minimal muzzle flash protects night vision. Feeds reliably in all pistols. Shiny silver nickel plating prevents corrosion, and is easily visible in low light situations. Bullets are cannelured and crimped to avoid bullet setback. 
Bullets are custom designed for individual loads. The most effective, consistent, and reliable self-defense ammunition available today!"

Surefire C3 Centurion® Single-Output Incandescent
Item Code: SFR_C3

C3 - The C3 is a high-output flashlight featuring a CombatGrip body. It uses a precision micro-textured reflector and a SureFire incandescent lamp to produce a smooth, brilliant beam with more than enough power to temporarily blind and disorient an aggressor by impairing his night-adapted vision, or to reach out and illuminate distant areas. Output is either 105 or 200 lumens, depending on which easy-to-install lamp you use?high-output or ultra high-output. The tactically-correct pushbutton tailcap switch provides secure, ergonomic activation control: press for momentary-on, twist for constant-on. The C3's patented CombatGrip body improves performance with various flashlight/handgun techniques, such as the Rogers/SureFire technique, and provides a secure hold in wet or cold conditions or while wearing gloves.

Features:
Brilliant white light from high-output lamp (included)
Precision micro-textured reflector creates smooth, optimized beam
Coated tempered window resists impact, maximizes light
CombatGrip for secure hold in all conditions
High-strength aerospace aluminum body, anodized (BK) or Mil-Spec hard-anodized (HA) for durability

The official police is in the same condition, with the exception of single pin point ""dot"" on the non-letter side of the barrel--otherwise, appears unfired and as new. 

These guns belonged to a friend who was a banker for 50 years. He acquired them over the years and kept them in a drawer at his office. He never loaded or fired them. Neither have I.

It has been nothing but reliable and has served as my partner in some sticky situations. The rifle has approximately 4-5k rounds through it with exception of 1 or 2 hiccups from running it dry AND using Wolf ammo . It is NOT a safe queen. It has been carried on duty, hunted, and competed with. It has killed many feral hogs, coyotes, and I even bagged a buck at 225 yards with the EOtech, so it is VERY accurate. It has lots of extras that will NOT be parted with. It all goes together or it doesn't go at all. I would like the extra cash but do not need it, so lowball offers will be ignored. If you can find something similar cheaper, please, by all means, buy it from them and save me the trouble of reading useless PM's. Next to the parts will be prices for reference.

I'm sure there are extras laying around somewhere that I will try to include. Posted are older photos of the gun. Not much has changed other the lights and comps, both which DO NOT COME WITH THE GUN. I will take more pictures if requested. It will have an aftermarket flash hider (I can't remember what brand) and no light. I can include a Surefire Scout light with pressure pad OR an Insight Technologies MX3 for extra. I'm located in Owasso and will only meet in the Tulsa Metro area.

Asking $1,650 OBO with room to work on price. I can also add some 77gr BTHP, 55gr PSP, 55gr FMJ and possibly some 69 gr green tips for the right price. The only trades I am willing to accept is a 3rd gen Glock 19 with night sights and at least 3 newer high cap mags, semi large quantities of FMJ or defensive 9mm ammo, and possibly a S&W .38/.357 snubnose revolver. Hell, maybe I want something else, I dunno, send me an email, the worse I can say is no.

I reserve the right to deny sale to any party who cannot provide me with identification.  I will not sell the rifle without a bill of sale.  Don't like it?  Go elsewhere."

Originally an extremely rare experimental design, the Australians designed the No. 7 for their jungle fighters in Burma. Now Gibbs Rifle Company has recreated this carbine using the modern, stronger 2A barreled action made from chrome vanadium steel. Chambered for the popular .308 Winchester, each No. 7 starts out as a hand selected, barreled 2A action, and is then cleaned, inspected and refurbished. The original wood is retained and reconfigured, and a flash hider with a bayonet lug has been added to recreate the original Jungle Carbine dimensions. The No. 7 Jungle Carbine is a short, powerful carbine, perfect for today’s collector, shooter and sportsman. Weight - 8 lbs., Bbl Length - 20”, OAL - 40”, Cal - .308 Winchester."

This is a model '94, 38-55 with a short magazine. Serial number 387440 was manufactured March 4th, 1908. Even though the tang sight looks original to the gun (and it may have been put on the gun in 1908), the sight is approximately 20-years older than the gun is. I am intimately familiar with the early production Lyman tang sights (I collect them). The sight on your Model 1894 is the type found on the early Model 1873, 1876 and 1885 rifles. Those early sights are worth a fair bit more $$$ than the later ones.

The Following Info I have gotten from folks who are supposed to be experts
The arm really is a Model 1884! ""Model 1888"", while it had SOME contemporary usage is MOSTLY a term of modern collector convenience, to indicate the final version of the rod-bayonet.
Now, there WERE 100 rifles (noted as having a ""positive cam"") actually marked ""U.S. Model 1888"" but they were experimental only - having a modification to the locking mechanism - they occur in the 4155xx range, and must not be confused with the normal rod-bayonet rifles, of which over 60,000 were produced.

A brand new model 85 sells for around $325, however the new version of the model 85 is quite a bit lighter, and the quality of manufacture of the new model 85's are somewhat lack luster in comparison to this older production model. Mine was manufactured in 1992, has never been fired and is in very very good condition. You pay a little more for an older handgun, but you are getting much better quality, heavier weight for more control and better recoil control. This little gem has lead a rather dull life living in my night stand. I want to upgrade to a semi auto, but this handgun would make a very nice CC piece.


Asking $400 OBO, I live in the Simpsonville area. You can reach me via email @ REDACTED if you have questions, want to see the handgun or want to purchase it. 

After careful consideration, I've decided to reverse course on the trades issue. I am open to even trades for semi auto handguns in my area. If you have something in excellent condition you want to trade for this pristine revolver, then please email me what you have to offer with pictures. I'm interested in semi auto's with a good reputation for quality, 9mm, 40, 45's that I might shoot for fun or CC. I've already replaced the revolver with a S&W 4043 for home defense, but I would consider other guns for CC or recreational shooting."

948,http://www.armslist.com/posts/389948,For Sale:  Model 1816 Eli Whitney 1834  *THIS MUSKET HAS BEEN SOLD,"Southport, Wilmington, North Carolina",$ 395,"Listed On: Friday, June 8, 2012",Muzzle,no type,no type,no type,Muzzle Loader,"This musket started its life as a US model 1816, 69 caliber smoothbore flintlock  musket. The Whitneyville Armory was awarded two contracts to produce these muskets between 1822 and 1841. Some collectors call it the Whitney model 1822, as it had some slight improvements over the standard 1816 model. Other then some early muskets having a ""browned"" barrel, I could never figure out just what else was different. The 1834 date on the lock plate is the year it was made. It is the second of the three types of lock plates used.

This musket  has been converted to percussion, probably in the 1840s or 50s, by what is called the ""Belgian Alteration"". The brass part you see on the lock, is what remains of the flash pan. The NG and 50 on the butt plate  May be a unit marking, as many of the model 1816s were given to the states as militia allotments. The initials JM on the barrel are credited to Justin Murphy, an inspector at the armory. Many of these muskets saw service in the early days of the civil war.

At sometime, someone cut about a foot off the end of your barrel. It should be 42 inches long and have three bands holding it to the stock. After the civil war, all muzzle loaded firearms became obsolete, and there was thousands of them to be had. Many, were sold as cheap shotguns, and to make them easier to handle in the field, were shortened. Some were shortened by gunsmiths, and are nicely done, some were just sawed off. I actually saw one that was cut using a pipe cutter. It would be nice if it was not cut, it would be great if it was still an original flintlock. But all this is part of your muskets history, and our country's history as well. I'll bet there are not to many things you can buy today that will still be here in 175 years.
Payment is by US Postal Service money order only.

In order to determine value the condition of the firearm has to be known.

It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.
