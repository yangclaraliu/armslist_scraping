Because of the power and knock down capability.

All rise for the biggest, meanest Judge on the market. The new Raging Judge Ultra-Lite® now comes with the option to load the mighty .410 shotshell. That’s right, we’re giving you the option to choose from .410 3-inch or 2.5-inch shotshells and .45 Colt ammo—all in the same revolver! The Raging Judge Ultra-Lite® has a 7-shot cylinder, larger than its brothers in the Judge line and offers the “Raging Bull” backstrap to reduce felt recoil. Larger, 7-Shot Cylinder
Dual lockup cylinder
Provides stability under extreme chamber pressures.
Cushioned insert grip
Exclusive on the RAGING ™ Series large frame revolvers, Cushioned insert grip pillows recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.
Fiber Optic Sight
Light gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer the shooter the highly visible dot created by the end of the fiber optic

Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Fire Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to bump fire more safely, offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! You can now safely and accurately bump-fire your AR-15 at an incredible rate. Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, and Installation / Operation Instructions. Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship.

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the firearm. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.

Fitment:
Only compatible with AR-15's with a collapsible stock (add the conversion kit if you have a fixed stock AR-15).

Compatible with Mil-Spec and Commercial Buffer Tubes.

Not compatible with .22LR AR-15's without a .22LR upgrade kit.

Some Sling Plates may not be compatible.

Some of the aftermarket ""billet"" receivers have non-standard dimensions and therefore may not be compatible.

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. This SUB-2000 is available in 9 mm Luger 
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
Calibers:	9mm Luger	40 S&W
Weight unloaded:	4.0 lbs.	1.8kg
Length Open:	29.5""	749mm
Length Closed:	16""	406mm

Rifle features an internal keyed deployment lock. Rifle can be reduced to a size of16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage:	406 x 178 mm
The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

The 9mm SUB-2000 is configured in the following magazine type: S&W59

I've spend about another 100 on smithing, to add these and to polish the feed ramp.  Shes a great gun and id hate to see her leave but need to sell her to fund other projects... 

Keltec P3AT in Great Condition
Got her for a truck gun a while back because of the size and no longer need her. She has less than 100 rounds through her and I'll include all the ammo I have left, about 25 federal HP, and 75 Winchester target/range rds. 

 Great Deep Concealed gun. So much so that when I got home from work and saw my wife she said is that a gun in your pocket or are you just happy to see me? I had to answer honestly, so I said I'm happy to see you but in my other pocket there is a gun...

 Comes with four factory mags, and the keltec box I got her in.  As I said before the ammo 100 rounds... 
Each mag is 20 bucks and it only came with one when I bought her... 
280 is the asking price and that's like you getting a free mag in there... 
Your welcome

Makes a perfect back up's back up. AS yall know your rifle is the real gun. your side arm is the back up and this should be your back up to the backup your side arm. A great little gun, that will always go bang when you fire it, and hopefully too small to be confused with your manhood.

Diamondhead’s DIAMOND ""Gas Block"" Integrated Sighting System comprises the acclaimed Diamondhead Diamond Rear Sight with the increased height Diamond ""Gas Block"" Front Sight for AR15.

WHY IS THE DIAMONDHEAD™ INTEGRATED SIGHTING SYSTEM FASTER AND MORE ACCURATE?
During high speed, high stress shooting, the eye needs reference points. The Diamondhead™ Integrated Sighting System provides them. The conventional rear sight's round aperture and round (HK style) front sight housing, can make shooting at longer distances difficult and inaccurate. Remember, rear sights are blurry during aiming. The simple fact is that it is easier for the eye to find the exact center of a blurry diamond than the exact center of a blurry circle. It is even easier and quicker for the eye to find the exact center of a Diamondhead™ rear sight’s aperture with the added posts at the corner of the diamond. These proprietary reference posts are unique to the Diamondhead™ sight and are not found on any other iron sight.

The other main reason the Diamondhead™ (Pat. & Pat. Pend.) diamond-shaped aperture is better than a conventional round aperture is because round apertures don’t give a truly ROUND picture of the front sight and target. The front sight tower of the rifle obscures the bottom portion of the conventional rear sight round aperture. This causes the the bottom part of the round aperture to be flattened – not round. The result is that it is harder for the eye to quickly make an accurate decision about how high up in this flattened circle is the exact center. Take a look at a set of conventional (round) sights to see. 

The 3:00 o’clock and 9:00 o’clock corners of the Diamondhead™ aperture, combined with the added accuracy of the reference posts, completely eliminate this problem. Used in combination with the Diamondhead DIAMOND Flip-Up Front Combat Sight™ or the Diamondhead “Auto-Ranger” Flip-Up Front Combat Sight™, there will always be a clear reference for considerably more accurate (and faster) target acquisition.

This is a short home defense shotgun well worth the money. I'd buy this off him myself if I had the extra cash.

I live in Concord and he lives in Sunapee, so those are the areas we could meet."

             BERETTA M9A1 (92FS) + Three PVD 15 round Magazines!

This is a Beretta M9 that is less than two years old and has less than 200 rounds thru it.
It is in fantastic shape, and has many plus features as described below. Pistol made in USA in Accokeek, MD.

It comes with or installed:

A threaded 1/2"" x 28 t.p.i. barrel and 3 barrel thread protectors. The barrel was done by Tornado Technologies Inc. so that muzzle break, suppressor can be added. (MSRP $195.00)

Trijicon Inc. tritium night sights- done by Trijicon themselves in-house (had slide shipped to them for professional installation of tritium night sights). Cost was $183.00.

There is NO plastic / nylon on this pistol. The trigger, steel guide rod, safety de-cocking lever (safety), and lanyard spring housing replaced with all steel parts. Cost and installation by Gunsmith of these parts was around $240.00)

A Wolff GunSprings Inc. trigger conversion unit (I.N.S. model- Immigration and Naturalization Services) extra power unit for faster, crisper returns. (MSRP $19.99)

Wolff Gunsprings Inc. steel guide rod. (MSRP $24.95)

Wolff Gunsprings Inc. recoil spring x-tra power, 16# (MSRP $7.89)

A Beretta USA oversize magazine release button. OEM part. (MSRP $39.00)

Hogue overmolded black grips with finger groves and Hogue hex (Allen) grip screws. (MSRP $16.95 for grips + $8.95)

(3) Beretta USA M9A sand resistant PVD 15 rnd. magazines with Beretta black rubber magazine pads. Magazines and magazine pads Beretta OEM parts (MSRP $55.00 for each magazine + $7.00 per black rubber magazine pads!) Magazines are made in Italy. The keys are a special PVD coating, a lowfrictionfollower, and internal box geometry for the greatest reliability and durability from the magazine.

Wolff Gunspring Inc. +10% extra power magazine springs inside all three magazines. (MSRP $17.29)

A Wolff Gunsprings Inc. ""D"" spring installed (main spring made for Beretta model 96) for smoother lighter double action pull (first pull of trigger- smoother than factory spring). (MSRP $14.99)

If you were going to own a Beretta, this M9 A1 is ready to roll with all its accessories and add-ons! Picatinny rail also a stand out and functional for adaptation of laser and/or weapon light. This rail is incorporated in design / manufacture of pistol. This M9 is almost factory new and would say a 98% condition. Email me with any questions. Comes with Instruction manual, but no box (box was plain cardboard with NSN# for military shipment).

If you have any knowledge of the Beretta 92's, this pistol is loaded (no pun) with great trigger control and a gentle first pull with the ""D"" spring installed. Trijicon tritium sights are year 2011 and still have plenty of time before half-life expiration of tritium. Trijicon drills front sight and installation was professionally done in-house at Trijicon.  An extremely accurate, functional almost new out of box M9A1 pistol! The tritium 3-dot sights are all green.

I have been recieving questions as to ""what"" this is- an M9A1 or a 92FS. It is most certainly a M9A1. Also I placed a small piece of duct tape over serial #'s for privacy- and the #'s are not de-faced in any way. The following answer to a question I recieved may be able to clear things up a bit:

It is a M9A1. I placed a piece of ""hurricane"" black duct tape over last digits to protect privacy. It is by no means defaced and duct tape comes ""right off"".
The Instruction book that was included was for that of a 92FS.

On left side of frame ON FRAME by serial # is stamped- Type M9A1 above picatinny rail.

On right side of slide ON SLIDE ITSELF (not on frame) is stamped- MOD. 92FS-CAL 9MM Parabellum- PATENTED.
Hopefully this is helpful and I accept all emails with your questions about this pistol."

The AMT Backup has been a favorite concealed handgun for law enforcement officers for many years. These two Stainless Steel firearms have seen some service, but have excellent bores , magazines and shooting qualities. One is a .380 caliber with walnut-colored grips, and the second fires the powerful .45 acp round with composite grips. The 380 was built in the El Monte, CA factory, while the 45 acp came later after the factory relocated to Irwindale, CA. While the surfaces of the slides show some holster friction scratches, the metal is solid and no major cosmetic work is needed to restore the finish. I have owners manuals for both guns with detailed take-down and assembly charts included. I do not have the original boxes for these two compact guns. I have set the price for the pair at $599.00 and will sell them only as a pair at this time. If you are looking for a set of very fine back-up ""His n Hers"" guns, this is a good find for you. I am a private seller. I accept money orders and bank checks  and Of Course, CASH.

I'd rather trade for another gun of comparable value esp. a rimfire however I'm open to fair trades and cash offers.

Some forums have given this gun a raw deal but the 100 or so rounds I put down the barrel were a ton of fun. It has no manual safety and can be slam fired so it takes quite a bit of attention to operate safely.

PICS OF EVERYTHING ARE AVAILABLE VIA PHONE OR EMAIL.

The first guitar is an Alvarez Acoustic guitar. It has electric pickups for an amp, built in tuner, and nice strap and new excelon strings . This guitar was $699.99 new. Ill sale for $450 or equal trade.

The second guitar is a KISS EDITION Silvertone electric guitar. It is in perfect condition except for missing one string (less than ten dollars any guitar shop). This guitar is hard to put a price on. It is extremely rare, and even on ""google search"" it is hard to find a price on one. It sounds great, to a guitar player its worth the sound and the cool factor, to a collector this thing is nearly priceless. However, it is not my style, and i never play it, so ill take 125.00 cash (less than cost of walmart beginner guitar), or trade of equal value. 

The pellet gun is not your average ""Red Ryder"". It is a Remington Vantage 1200. It shoots a .177 caliber pellet 1200FPS with regular pellets and over 1500 FPS with the expensive pellets. It is the model that accepts scopes, however i never used one because it has amazing TruGlo fiber optic adjustable iron sites. I will sell it for $100.00 (its a $275.00 gun) or add it to a trade.

*I will sell all of it together for $550.00 or equal trade.
* May trade Silvertone and/or Remington Vantage (NOT THE ALVAREZ) for ammo in 9mm, .357, or 7.62x39

Well I've decided to thin the herd once more.  I'm consolidating my calibers to the smallest number possible, and this is my one and only .45acp I have left.  She is a LNIB 3rd gen Glock 30SF.  It has TruDot night sights that are very bright (2011), extended slide controls (that's not shiny wear in the pic, just my flash), 3.5lb trigger installed, 4 factory glock 10rd mags & all have the Pierce extensions on them, and I'm including 500rds of 230gr FMJ ammo.  asking $800 OBO for it all...  no pics of the ammo but it is included...new factory ammo not reloads or junk ammo.

This one is in 100% shape, it honestly looks brand new.  It probably hasn't had 100 rounds fired through it.  I really hate to see it go, but i just need to make life simpler.  The only trade I can do on it is for a 3rd gen or newer Glock 23/22/35 + cash on your end.  I don't really wanna trade for a police trade in model unless you want to put a lot of cash with it (I'm reasonable, but I'm not going to put more in a police trade in than I can go to the gun show and buy one for there), and I have to have at least 3rd gen for the light rail.  I do not want XD's, S&W's, etc...nothing against them but I'm just looking for a Glock or cash."

This pistol has been shot frequently, it's one of my favorites but it's time to make room for more. The rifling in the barrel is still perfect, the slide and barrel show signs of wear but it's purely cosmetic.
