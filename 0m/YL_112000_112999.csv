Great gun, believe it or not I'm looking for something a little more compact, a PM9. The CW9 is a striker fired, single stack, 7+1, 9mm, two tone stainless and polymer gun. This gun has 200rds through it, comes with original case and paperwork and fits awesome in your hand. It's in like-new condition and I seriously wouldn't sell it if I wasn't looking for more compact. Still tight as a drum and just broken in. No FTFs at all. I'm a smaller framed guy I need a smaller framed gun for CC.

If you have a used PM9 (2 mags) I will trade + $150 on my part. I really only want a PM9, but would consider an LCP (only) with 2 mags as an equal trade. Possibly even a Ruger LC9 + $50. Shoot me what you got, worst I can say is no thanks.

Also would trade for a Smith & Wesson M&P9c or Walther PPS + cash from me. Not interested in revolvers.

I'm firm on the selling price, I believe this gun to be in excellent condition and should be able to retain $350 in value. FTF in Tulsa area only. Thanks!"

It has beautiful grain in the wood, it has a weird style bluing on the barrel, it isnt blue but a brown colored bluing. I replaced the nipple, the riflings are good, I have never shot it. It has fixed sights. I see several of these around the $400 range. This gun isn't perfect but has a lot of character and some sentimental value.  I'm not sure what the actual value would be?"

Yes, I know Ravens are zinc alloy POS.  No intention of carrying this. This is solely intended to be a conversation piece/range toy/paperweight -- although I would prefer that it was functional. If the firing pin is broken or the magazine is missing that is no problem. Just as long as the frame isn't damaged and it hasn't been fished out of a river it should be fine.

This cannon is fully machined. It has a powder chamber that is built out of 5 1/4"" solid round, chamber is 2.5"" deep and 2"" across.

You can shoot it vertically (almost out of sight) or horizontal, the tongue reciprocates utilizing the 2 gas shocks when shooting horizontal to greatly reduce the recoil.

I only use 2 35mm film canisters of black powder to send a 16lb bowling ball almost out of sight.

It is safe and efficient. I designed this cannon for ease of use. You can pull up to a site and have a ball in the air in less than 3 minutes.

The business I am going to start is building bowling ball cannons! I need some funds first so I am selling my favorite toy.

I want $2850 cash and I am firm. Everything is new down to the nut on the spindles.

I will demo the cannon for serious buyers only, you must come to Stillwater.

I will take a partial trade for a high end AR, SAIGA 12, or a Remington VSF.

Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.

This is a stainless, bolt action with a 4+1 magazine. This firearm will come with the Stainless scope rings, and the Busnell 4-16X50 scope that has a red & green lighted reticle. I bought this gun a couple of years ago to carry on the farm to pick off coyotes, but i thought it to be to nice to tear up, so it has spent most of its life in the safe. This firearm has had about 50 rounds through it, but you'd never know by looking at it. This gun shoots great an groups well. I know I'll miss it after I get rid of it, but there is now room in the safe after the .223 I picked up today.

Original leather sling included.
Has a hole in the lower portion of the stock just in front of the trigger guard. It only goes through one side and appears to have no impact on the functioning of the weapon.

EDIT: I got confirmation from the owner that the hole was drilled by his father (the original owner) when he retired from hunting so that he could hang the rifle on the wall in his Den.

There are also two small holes and the extreme front and rear of the stock where different sling posts were installed at some point in the past.

It has the flip-up rear leaf sight and a hooded post front sight.
I don't know the exact age, but I'm told it was purchased new in the '80s.
However, research on the serial number indicates it may have been made in 1969, in which case it's in amazing condition!

Would like to get 350 or trade for a sub compact pistol, prefer glocks and 9mm, but will consider others.
I will look at all cash offers but this gun was 369 + tax, then over 100$+ shipping and taxes for the ati accessories, so please know I'm not selling this at the same price as a 15 year old mud gun, this is basically new, kept in the original box.

I have a custom forearm from Blackhawk! that I have installed onto the firearm and a Remington 870 synthetic stock that is black to compliment the gun. It looks very nice! It has a standard barrel length on it that comes with different chokes you can install to make make it have different shot spreads for either slugs, buck shot, or bird shot. I also have the magazine block that is required for hunting in Indiana which makes the magazine capacity go to 2 + 1. Standard it can hold 4 + 1. It can take 2-3/4 size shells and also 3 inch shells. It's a great gun and I really like it, I just have another shotgun I bought with a shorter barrel that I like to shoot more. Can be used for hunting and home defense.

Accurate trooper special revolver double/single action which 38 special can also be used.. Nice handgun. I bought this gun at a gun show in Austin, TX in the 90's. Has black rubber grips. Recoil is significantly less with the vented barrel, but of course result is the same. Where else can you get a 357 mag with these qualities for this price without the 10% taxes. This weapon is an excellent home defense weapon with its destructive stopping power. However it does have extensive penetration power, so the load you would use for home defense would need to be specific. Don't want to go through the walls when fired. The FPS on this round is very fast for a pistol typically. If you know these things, then I am preaching to the choir, but if you are wanting to become a new handgun owner for protection of your household please educate yourself of this fact. This particular round is powerful and accurate, but can be potentially dangerous as a home defense weapon if you do not have the appropriate ammo for shooting within the walls of your home, God forbid it ever comes to that. Buyer will need a valid drivers license. CCW license is a plus. FTF only. Email with inquiries."

This gun is in black, and many accessories are available to trick this gun out, as well as shorter barrels. This is a really cool well built gun, all steel barrel and solid, which also reduces recoil. $125 Firm."

Century Arms VZ2008 is a clone of the Czechslovakian Vz58 Rifle.  This rifle comes with a used sling, and one 30rd aluminum magazine.  This is paratrooper model with the folding metal buttstock.  This rifle shoots straight and true.  The Czechslovakian VZ rifle is known to be slightly more accurate than the AK47 design and is lighter, but uses the same round as the AK47.  The VZ design also has a bolt hold open feature, so that you know when you have fired the last round in your magazine, unlike the AK47 design.  This gun uses a milled receiver, so the quality is better than a stamped receiver.  $450 cash for this gun, and you must travel to the OKC area.
