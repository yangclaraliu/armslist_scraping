It comes just as I bought it with case, extra mag, gunlock, oil. The current wait time for these pistols are 9 to 12 months, here is your chance to own one with no wait. I ordered this pistol on an impulse buy and have no use for it. I got it fathers day weekend and shot 200 rounds through it with no problems. It also comes with a lighter 10lb recoil spring so that you can shoot .38 cal rounds as well. I have not tried to shoot any 38's through it yet.  It's a really cool pistol and packs one hell of a punch but it will just sit in the safe. I paid $1436 after tax for this pistol and i have an offer of $1400 cash already.  Let me know what you have to offer. I would consider a Glock 23 Gen 4 as partial trade.

 I pay CA$H. -or- I can trade you a real shootin' gun. I have a nice .22 that I will trade. Choose from a bolt or automatic.

I found this on the web which I found to be interesting....

The 311-h in 12 ga x 2-3/4"" & 3"" has a full choke barrel on the left, and a mod choke barrel on the right. Most fixed choke double-barreled shotguns larger than .410 have different chokes on the barrels, so you can shoot for the pattern you need for the range you need. If you look really closely, you will notice on the 311 series H, one of the last 311 series made, that they even regulated the barrels for different ranges, and that your full choke barrel points slightly higher than the mod choke, to center the pattern on the sight post at a longer range.  Cool, huh?

CASH ONLY. PRICE IS FIRM.

I have this highly accessorized Mossberg Model 500 Persuader 20"" Shotgun for sale. It is model #50580. It originally came with pistol grip and heat shield from the factory.

I added quite a few sweet accessories such as a Hogue rubber overmolded forend, Hogue rubber grip enhancer, and the excellent Knoxx Specops Recoil-Reducing Stock, complete with the optional PowerPak kit. The Powerpak has storage for small items like batteries on one side of the stock, and holds 5 shotshells on the other side. I also added a Tacstar Side Saddle for an additional 6 shotshells on the side of the receiver.

I am the original owner and have had this gun for many years. I have hardly shot it and that is why I'm selling it now.

I have all the original parts including the pistol grip and handguard, in case you want to change it back to its original configuration.

I am not interested in trades and the price is firm. If you add up the cost of all these parts, the dealer fees, taxes and all that stuff I think you'll agree it's a pretty good deal.

Thanks for looking!

Certainly not a day at your reloading table. Which is why Hornady created the 366 Auto, a machine that cranks out low-cost reloads in a hurry, so you can spend more time shooting. It's easy. All you do is set in an empty case and wad, and then pull the operating lever. Everything else is done for you-automatically. Every stroke turns out a precisely crimped shell, fully resized to factory dimensions.

The 366 Auto features full-length resizing, automatic primer feed, swing-out wad guide, three-stage Taper-Loc crimping, automatic advance to the next station, automatic ejection and one primer tube filler. Additional die sets are available in 12, 20, and 28 gauge.

This Hornady 366 reloading press is sized for 12 Ga.

Like new condition. Comes with everything pictured including spare parts, 75ish pounds of shot, wads and hulls. Hulls are not pictured but I have one or two large bags.

438,http://www.armslist.com/posts/443438,For Sale/Trade:  Webley Mark I Revolver,"Dayton, Dayton, Ohio",$ 375,"Listed On: Friday, June 22, 2012",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale/trade is a Webley Mark I revolver, Not a Mark I* or I**, so this is an example of the earliest model of Webley.
Some minor pitting in places but no obvious surface rust. Blued finish.
Lockup seems to be tight.
Proof marks everywhere..serial number of ""1022"" and all the serial numbered parts match.

It's been shaved for .45 ACP use(with moon clips) rather than the original .455 Webley cal. The very bottom edge of the serial numbers on the rear face of the cylinder are missing and the cylinder face has no proof marks on it at all.
I think the the barrel has been cut and the front sight moved. Looks to be a pretty good job if so. I understand that the barrel cutting and shaved cylinders were pretty common when they were imported to make them more palatable to the US market as the original .455 Webley cal wasn't really available here.

The star extractor does not snap back into place when you open the gun, the extractor stays in the ""up"" position until you start to close the gun, then it lowers. I have not disassembled it so it could be just dirt/gunk. The gun can still be loaded/fired regardless. 

UPDATE - Ive had numerous emails from other Webley owners that it's most likely dirt/gunk causing the above. You'll mileage may vary..I'll leave it to the new owner.

The Mark I Webleys were last made in the 1890's, so since it was made pre 1899, it can be bought/sold/mailed, etc. without a FFL as it's considered ""antique"". Includes brown leather holster. This is the epitome of the classic British pistol at the height of their empire. Or if you just want to look like Sherlock Holmes. The pictures are a little deceiving...this is a big, heavy pistol, with a huge .45 cal bore. :)

I'm looking to trade it outright for a modern firearm, or asking $375.00 cash as well. Please feel free to email with any questions or request pics of specific areas of the pistol. Thanks for looking."

(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksj-XJzVQik)  

It is a duotone job with the ""graphite black"" on the slide and I think it was the ""sniper grey"" on the frame, giving it the reverse two tone look. It was done professionally by the company so no worries about it being an amateur job. It cost me 150.00 to get both the slide and frame CERAKOTE'ed, and then another 30.00 (180.00 total without shipping) for the duotone because they were different colors. Looks completely natural, no flaw in the workmanship at all. The only way to tell that it is coated is to hold it up to a regular reverse two tone SIG. It's a beautiful piece of art and workmanship. Flawless. Has an extremely low round count through it. Has been cleared and oiled ever time it has been shot. I'd like 600 for this piece of art, but I need the money so I am bringing it down to 500.00 and even though it would probably break my heart I might be persuaded to bring it down a bit more. I bought the gun for 380.00 total and then put the 180.00 coat on it. So a 560.00 deal package for 500.00. Seems very reasonable for to me. Make me an offer and we can see what we can do.

This is a rather hard to find Colt Python Hunter. Chambered for the .357 Magnum, this Python wears the 8"" barrel with special rollmarking and was factory supplied with the Leupold/Colt scope and mounts. The high quality aluminum Zero-Halliburton case was also factory supplied along with the accessories (cleaning gear, cartridge box, etc). This revolver is in excellent-plus condition. The original blue finish rates very nearly 100% with only a very faint cylinder turn line. Judging from the cylinder face and recoil shield, it does not appear to have been fired! Perfect bore and action. Comes with all the original accessories including the correct owner's manual. The aluminum case shows some exterior wear with scratches and dings but the hinge and latches work perfectly. The original foam liner had turned to dust so it was recently replaced with a unit ordered from Zero-Halliburton. This is a great looking revolver and quite a find for the python collector! Buyer pays $25.00 shipping."

It started out as a rock river lar15 which then had the following ""extra touches"". The barrel has been trued and shroud tensioned to the gas block like volquartsen match rifles and pistols which gives the affect of HBAR or heavy bull barrel WITHOUT THE WEIGHT! The rifle also sports rock rivers two stage national match trigger which is consistently at 2.5 pounds if i remember correctly. the furniture on the rifle starting from the rear is a ACE tubular stock which gives you a good compact feel and short length of pull. The handguard system is a VLTOR which as we all know isnt cheap. The rear of the rail was shortened for the rifle allowing the use of iron sights which isnt typical with this rail. The sights on the rifle are rear LMT match sight and a Truglo green illuminated sight. All in all you get a VERY nice package im just looking for something different so out with this one. And yes the rifle is extremely accurate one MOA isnt a problem once so ever. Any questions just leave a email or call or text at REDACTED5."

FrogLube is a revolutionary bio-based gun cleaner, lubricant and preservative (CLP) product made from food-grade ingredients all obtained exclusively from US suppliers. It is a new “green” product developed for government use by San Diego-based Audemous, Inc, a company that evaluates products in the emerging environmental, safety and health sector.

FrogLube was founded by CAPT Larry Lasky, US Navy SEAL (ret), who spent 32 years in service to the United States Special Operations Command, Naval Special Warfare and to the U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines whose gallant performance he attributes to every success on any mission and on any battlefield he has served. After a career of uncounted operations in every environment from jungle, to arctic, to maritime and desert, he’s seen the impact of these extremes on weapons and equipment. He felt the best equipment; products and weapons always came from combining the most arduous conditions and the solutions created by the world’s best field “operators”. He’s taken this ethos into product development with FrogLube, a new technology lubricant designed to replace inferior and toxic petroleum-based products that foul actions, attract carbon and stick to dirt and grime.

The bullet guide is a widow's peak variety, NOT the dreaded U-shaped. The headspace is actually correct, and the barrel was properly timed by a gunsmith. The bolt carrier group and receiver DO NOT have matching serial numbers. Also, I'm not sure what parts kit was used, but everything looks peachy-keen down there and it runs just great.

The gunsmith I got it appraised from told me I should get $800 out of this but... I didn't get it for that much. $700 is very fair for a rifle in this good condition. I've shot a little over 100 rounds through it (Lake City M80 reloads, as in the PTR I am selling), and it DID have a double feed because I had the gas system let ALL the way out. 

Why am I selling it? Two reasons: the adjustable gas system has only two settings, vice the normal 8 of premium builds. This doesn't really matter so much, but I like to have the best. Also, there is no last-round bolt hold-open feature. Evidently this was an intentional drawback by the manufacturers built-in to the Sporter variety, as stated in the manual it came with.  

Comes with 1 20rd metric magazine. Metric magazines work just fine.

FrogLube is a revolutionary bio-based gun cleaner, lubricant and preservative (CLP) product made from food-grade ingredients all obtained exclusively from US suppliers. It is a new “green” product developed for government use by San Diego-based Audemous, Inc, a company that evaluates products in the emerging environmental, safety and health sector.

FrogLube was founded by CAPT Larry Lasky, US Navy SEAL (ret), who spent 32 years in service to the United States Special Operations Command, Naval Special Warfare and to the U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines whose gallant performance he attributes to every success on any mission and on any battlefield he has served. After a career of uncounted operations in every environment from jungle, to arctic, to maritime and desert, he’s seen the impact of these extremes on weapons and equipment. He felt the best equipment; products and weapons always came from combining the most arduous conditions and the solutions created by the world’s best field “operators”. He’s taken this ethos into product development with FrogLube, a new technology lubricant designed to replace inferior and toxic petroleum-based products that foul actions, attract carbon and stick to dirt and grime.

FrogLube is a revolutionary bio-based gun cleaner, lubricant and preservative (CLP) product made from food-grade ingredients all obtained exclusively from US suppliers. It is a new “green” product developed for government use by San Diego-based Audemous, Inc, a company that evaluates products in the emerging environmental, safety and health sector.

FrogLube was founded by CAPT Larry Lasky, US Navy SEAL (ret), who spent 32 years in service to the United States Special Operations Command, Naval Special Warfare and to the U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines whose gallant performance he attributes to every success on any mission and on any battlefield he has served. After a career of uncounted operations in every environment from jungle, to arctic, to maritime and desert, he’s seen the impact of these extremes on weapons and equipment. He felt the best equipment; products and weapons always came from combining the most arduous conditions and the solutions created by the world’s best field “operators”. He’s taken this ethos into product development with FrogLube, a new technology lubricant designed to replace inferior and toxic petroleum-based products that foul actions, attract carbon and stick to dirt and grime.

Current set up for 9mm.  Change the carrier and you can load any hand gun caliber, and I think you maybe able to get a carrier for 223 as well (please check with Lee).  The one I have for sale is the exact one shown here: http://leeprecision.com/pro-1000-9mm-luger.html  I built a stable table for it as seen in the pictures.  If they are upside down sorry, I can email pics.  I have everything boxed up, but the instructions and info are all online.  Over the winter I made about 1000 rounds, and it was fun.  However, I'm moving several states away, and this didn't make the cut.  The table is small enough for a corner of a garage or basement without causing too much clutter.  As you can see I removed the reloader but it is predrilled for the machine for stable reloading.  
I will also include the Lyman reloading manual seen here: http://www.amazon.com/Lyman-Reloading-Handbook-49th-Edition/dp/B001FBFW6U/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=REDACTED&sr=1-4&keywords=reloading+manual
I'll throw in a bunch of range pick up 9mm cases, quality electronic scale, and also the vibrating case tumbler with plenty of (i think) crushed walnut husks for cleaning cases.  It can fit anywhere between 150-200 cases with ease.  Turn it on and leave it for a few and come back to bright shiny cases.  
I spent about 300-350 for this set up plus the time to build it.  The lee press works well, you just have to get it tuned in, but once it is set up perfectly, you'll have some great bullets for the range in no time flat.  There are also plenty of videos on youtube to help set up.
