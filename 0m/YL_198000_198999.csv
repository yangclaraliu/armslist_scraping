A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime

If you are looking for a reliable well made home defense or tactical shotgun with some personality, you won't find one better than this one for sale right now. This shotgun is so unique and will set you apart from any other tactical shotgun owner.

Go to this link to view my Photo Bucket Album of this Shotgun:

 http://s978.photobucket.com/albums/ae270/guard87/870%20Custom/


For your consideration is a Remington 870 shotgun, built to outlast, outperform, and out-shoot all others, and with style. This 870 fires 2 3/4"" as well as 3"" Magnum loads. It can also carry up to 6+1 3"" shells. The barrel is a heavy walled Remington Police barrel, and the metal trigger guard, as well as the changing out of MIM parts help make this the most robust and reliable 870 available. This is a very solid and attractive shotgun, the Punisher engraving is very unique and quite fitting. The pictures don't do it justice. No pun intended :) It is equipped with the following:

*Receiver shell ejection side is inscribed/engraved with ""The Punisher"" in text and the famous Punisher skull. 
Filled in with white and silver long lasting color. It's not hard to guess what this shotgun's name is!

* 18.5"" Remington 870 Police barrel with Improved Cylinder bore and adjustable rifle sights.

* Custom fitted and permanently attached steel heat shield

*Trijicon 3 dot night sights (still light up well)

*Military grade synthetic ribbed forearm

*Remington Mariner/High polished nickle/chrome action tube assembly and forearm nut

*Remington Mariner/High polished nickle/chrome shell lifter.

*Chrome police bolt assembly

*Milled police grade extractor from Remington (this shotgun contains zero MIM (Molded injected metal) parts unlike the 870 Express shotguns

*Cast metal military/police grade trigger guard/assembly

*Drilled and tapped receiver

*EGW (Evolution Gun Works) Picatinny tactical rail is solid and made in the USA

* Tasco Red Dot Scope in perfect working condition with batteries

*Upgraded anti-walk trigger assembly pins that won't bump loose from recoil

*2-shot Remington Mag Tube extension

*Factory Mag tube extension barrel clamp

*Wilson combat extra power magazine spring for improved reliability

*Wilson Combat High Visibility magazine follower improves feeding and makes it easier to see that the magazine is empty.

*SpeedFeed III Tactical Magazine pistol grip stock holds a total of 4 2/34"" shells (2 on each side of stock)

*Sling swivel studs installed in stock and barrel clamp

*Also includes a custom modular quick detachable stock that allows you to quickly go from a Hogue pistol grip only- to a pistol grip with a stock with a comfortable angle for optimal sighting ability without the use of any tools. Its a highly adaptable stock system that is ready for anything. Stock has a shorter length of pull and works great for those wearing body armor.

*Includes factory Iron Sights if you so prefer to install them again in the future.

Mechanically this shotgun is pristine, the bore is bright and shiny, there is zero rust, and this is the most reliable shotgun you can get with such unique and incredible craftsmanship.

This add is for a used firearm and as such there are no returns. This must ship to an FFl dealer unless you are local and can provide pickup. Shipping is $30 I am only selling this shotgun out of my personal collection to free up some much needed cash. Thanks for looking and good luck!"

It is like new because I just got it and only ran two boxes of Fiocci through it at the range. Through that 100 rounds didn't have a single hickup. I would like to trade this gun for another pocket pistol. Preferably a Beretta Tomcat. I may be able to trade this gun + cash for your tom cat. I would also consider trading for a ruger LCP. I like the look a little better and the .380 round a little better than the .32 ACP. If you have anything else that is similar to these let me know. NO 25 ACPs or .22's. This Keltec of mine is nice, super light, and reliable. I just can't get used to the trigger. So I'd like a Beretta for the single action option. And the tip up barrel would come in handy for my wife. Thanks for your time, God bless."

I have here an UNFIRED, first production run, pre-ban TEC-9. This includes ALL of the original manufacturer accessories that were offered AND THREE 30 round mags and 1 20 ROUND MAG 
Because this is the early 1986 version before the ban it has all of the great features that the junky, neutered later models lacked such as the threaded barrel and included detachable barrel extension/F.suppressor/guard and the detachable compensator. 

Let me reiterate - this gun is UNFIRED. It is beautiful and immaculate. It includes all of the accessories included ONLY with the pre-ban model.

This is a one of a kind deal - I challenge anyone to find an unfired pre-ban TEC-9 of this quality for as low a price as this, let alone one with the original accessories eliminated after the ban.

INCLUDED ACCESSORIES: (all manufacturer original parts)

Imagine, no more earplugs or muffs, even for suppressors designed for the mighty 50 BMG. Makes .22's sound like a pellet gun, and .45's aren't much louder. This is the only way to shoot.

Most people are unaware that civilian ownership of silencers is completely legal in most states, including Arkansas. That means, no more stinkin' ear plugs or muffs. There are so many benefits to using silencers, I don't know why anyone would ever shoot without them. Not only the hearing aspect, but reduced recoil, better shot grouping & far reduced flash & dust signature. There are so many different types, sizes and price ranges available to you. You're really missing so much shooting enjoyment by not using a silencer.

Every Buck Mark starts out as a solid piece of aircraft-grade 7075 aluminum alloy, and then is CNC machined to exacting tolerances. The crisp single-action trigger, hand reamed chamber, target crowned barrel and finely adjustable target sights mean the Buck Mark comes ready for fun straight from the box. The Ultragrip DX represent the latest in grip technology. The finger grooves, laser stippling and stylish wave patterns combine to form an Ergonomic Interactive Surface (EIS) that puts your hand in the same place on the grip for every shot, resulting in more instinctual shooting and improved accuracy. The textured surfaces are comfortable and secure in any condition, while the narrow profile makes them perfect for all hand sizes.

It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens.

It is a SAR-1 AK-47 in 7.62x39 with a chrome lined barrel. This thing is very clean and barely played with. IIRC, I got this from the original owner or he was second owner but bought it near prod date (2000) and spent most time in his safe. This is a 2000 rifle so no evil bayo lug or threads on muzzle. Trigger is a Tapco G2 and I did upgrade the grip. I have only shoot a couple hundred rounds through it but it ran smooth and kneeling I was able to put almost every round (25-28) from the 30 round mag in a 12"" circle at 100yards. I know some people and guns can do A LOT better but from my expierence thats pretty good for me with an AK. 

Comes as shown with just gun and one 30rnd mag. Also includes original operation manual from factory (not a generic AK manual but the actual SAR manual).

 the webley is hammerless in name only,since it used an internal hammer, and the H&r lockwork was rather different than the webley, probably as a matter of manufacturing convenience.more obvious is the shaping of the barrel and slide; in the webley pattern the slide is open topped with a bridge carrying the front sight.as a result the barrel is slender so the bridge can pass over it on recoil.
 the H&R model uses an open topped slide without a bridge,and the barrel rear section is built up to continue the contours of the slide;there are no rear sights fitted. the external contours of the H&R are more generally radiussed than those of the webley, and the grips are fitted in a different manner.
it was believed that there was little demand for the .25 model and few were made..H&R also produced a .32 model which, while based on webley practice, was not a counterpart of any webley and scott model. it was 'hammerless' ( i.e internal hammer)model with open topped slide and extended barrel, and a short grip safety at the rear of the butt. it also used a coil spring recoil spring above the bolt, instead of the webley v-spring system. this model appeared shortly befor the first world war, and continued to me made into the early 1920's.

Has a 3-9 bushnell slug scope, and will hold a sub 3 inch group at 100 yards with Hornady SST Obviously this sounds larger than it is given that the 12 guage slug makes a considerable sized hole lol. This was inherited from an uncle and is incredible condition. I just already have a slug gun. Seems to be going on the market around 300 + so with the nice scope I think $300 is very fair. Im willing to travel within maybe 30 or so miles from 43050. I will have pics posted later this afternoon.  Thanks for looking. 

Borrowed this from the web-Marlin 512 Slugmaster
Yes, Browning might be getting the most attention but it was not the first production bolt-action gun available with a rifled barrel. That distinction went to the Marlin Model 512 Slugmaster, which was first produced in 1994. Modeled after the company’s long-standing Model 55 models, the most famous of which is the 36-inch barreled Goose Gun, the 512 features a 21-inch fully rifled (one turn in 28 inches) barrel and two-shot detachable-box magazine with rifle sights.

The 8.5-pound gun is built on a checkered birch stock. The 512 is actually a close cousin to the Model 55S (for slug) that Marlin marketed in the 1960s, which featured a 24-inch smoothbore barrel, rifle sights and sling swivels.

Today the root of the bolt handle certainly provides sufficient locking strength since shotgun chamber pressure levels barely reach one-quarter of that of a high powered rifle, which must be front-locked.

The Marlin bolt is mounted well forward, Mannlicher style, and notches in a slot in the receiver top, necessitating a side scope mount (Weaver 10M). A heavy recoil lug is set between the receiver and barrel into a recess in the stock.


Suggested retail for the 512 is in the $350 neighborhood

I am selling my Sig P229 to make room in the safe. The gun is in great shape with finish wear on the mating areas of the barrel and slide. The bore is great and the gun functions perfectly. Approx. 800 rounds through this gun. Please e-mail for additional photos.

This gun is SA/DA with de-cocker, chambered in .40 s&w and comes with factory night sights, 3 authentic Sig 12 round mags (2 new), a nice adjustable paddle holster (not pictured), and a lame kydex belt holster. The original night sights have started to dim, so I will throw in a new set of factory night sights with your purchase.

TERMS: I prefer to do a cash, hand-to-hand transaction (Loveland area). I will NOT sell to a felon, so be prepared to provide evidence that you can legally own this gun, such as a copy of your CCW.  You could also arrange for an FFL transfer(~$20).  If you aren't local, I can also take a postal money order and ship to your FFL for an additional $50, insured. Sale is final, as-is."

What I have for $150 is a Savage Mark II.

I no longer need it. I have over $200 invested in it and I never shot the thing!! 
AS A BONUS FOR BUYING THE GUN FOR THE AMOUNT LISTED OF $150 (I will not take any less!!)..I WILL INCLUDE...A NEW (not opened) Ruger 10/22 Drum and mimic flash suppressor (both items new never used)...the price I paid for these items together were $80.

Just for fun. Shooting a 1911 chambered in .22 LR is great practice and an ideal way to train new shooters. It is also affordable. A Kimber conversion kit for an existing 1911 pays for itself in the first few hundred rounds.
Kimber rimfire pistols have the same features and unequaled performance as Kimber centerfires. Adjustable sight, bumped beavertail grip safety and extended thumb safety are standard. Aluminum slides and frames make rimfire pistols exceptionally light—ideal for young shooters. Conversion kits work with all Kimber .45 ACP pistols that have either 4- or 5-inch barrels and single stack magazines. They also fit most brands of 1911 pistols, provided they are mil-spec, single stack, and do not have a ramped barrel. (For fit information, call Kimber at 800- 880-2418.) Conversion kits can be purchased directly from Kimber as they are not classified as a firearm.
