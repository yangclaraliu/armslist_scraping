    I have a Daewoo Dr-200 in .223 That I traded for a while back thinking I want something different than an Ar, turns out, I don't, SO it goes on the block for trade for an AR.

    The gun has been converted to accept a pistol grip and ACE stock. I bought the Folding mec. to make the ACE stock a folder. The gun has a 1 in 12 twist with gas piston. These were imported by Kimber of Oregon several years ago. It also has an b-square rail on top (rail had a notch added to accept a optic mount)
    The guy that had the gun before me put a value of $900 on it with solid stock, so with the folding stock, I would say a $850 value as well?

XD DAO triggers aren't as light as those of tuned 1911s, but the pulls are plenty crisp and short enough for accurate shooting. The .40 Sub-Compact's broke at 7 1/2 pounds with a very manageable amount of takeup. That's definitely in spec with the company claim of 5.5 to 7.7 pounds. Since Glock comparisons are inevitable, I'd like to state that, for my own use, I much prefer the more ""CZ 75-ish"" grip angle of the XD. The handles on a Glock exhibit too much of an acute backsweep for me personally--I have a tendency to shoot high with a Glock when I'm in a hurry; I have to consciously force the front sight down. SPECIFICATIONS Springfield XD .40 Sub-Compact IMPORTER: Springfield Armory ACTION: DAO Auto CALIBER: .40 S&W CAPACITY: 9 +1 BARREL LENGTH: 3 inches OVERALL LENGTH: 6.26 inches WEIGHT: 24 ounces FINISH: Matte Black SIGHTS: Fixed three-dot combat GRIPS: Synthetic



The sighting plane of the XD seems as broad as a six-lane highway--you're definitely getting a ""big gun"" sight picture on the Sub-Compact. Unless you have extraordinarily small hands, your little finger is going to have to contend with the short-grip magazine toe, but it's rounded and fairly comfortable.

Even with a round as potent as the .40 S&W, the XD Sub-Compact is pretty comfortable to shoot, but if you intend on rapid two-shot pairs, you're going to have to acclimate yourself to the up flip on that short barrel. And the power increase of the .40 over the 9mm version is definitely worth the extra time spent in familiarizing yourself with the enhanced recoil.

With the .40 Sub-Compact, Springfield Armory has come up with a chunky, no-nonsense, state-of-the-art CCW pistol. It's powerful, simple to operate, more accurate than it needs to be and boasts a 10-round capacity (with one in the chamber). If you're looking for potency in a small package, in the case of the XD Sub-Compact .40, less is definitely more."

Blackened aluminum frame with 30 lines-per-inch checkering contrasts with the premium aluminum trigger, stainless steel slide and satin ambidextrous thumb safety. Hand-checkered, double-diamond rosewood grips and low profile Tritium night sights are a nice touch as well."

I am selling my Smith & Wesson 40VE. I purchased about 1 year ago. I went to Blue Ridge Arsenal after work one night, bought a box of shells and Balckhawk holster with it, went to the range in the back, put 10 rounds down range, and went home to eat dinner. I cleaned the gun after dinner and explained to my wife that I was going to the range every weekend. It's sat clean in the box on my shelf ever since.

I lost my job, and finally found a new one . . . in the socialist republic of New York. It's going to be way too much hassle to get a pistol license and bring a firearm from out of state. $300 for a pistol license. $100 to transfer out of state personal. $400!!!!! That's what I paid for a new gun!!

I paid $385 for the pistol, and $48.99 for the holster. I am asking $350.00 for both.

I live in Alexandria. I'm tied up doing moving stuff all week, but I can meet anytime next Friday, Saturday, or Sunday (Feb 25 - 27).

It's a great pistol. I wish it wasn't such a pain to keep it in NY.

I was not sure if this would be a miscellaneous posting or not? But here goes. I have an extra m91/30 laying around, It is in pretty good shape. The stock is decent and would give someone something to do if they wanted to strip her down and refinish. I have a bayonet with it and the bag with all the oily goodies. Our camera is MIA so the only way I can send pics is probably through text. I am looking for a decent fishing rod and or reel? Looking only mainstream as in st. croix . Would prefer a 6'6 casting rod in medium to medium light. As for reels, Abu garcia especially the revo series, or a pt burner. I understand some of this equipment is pretty high in price so I quite possibly would add another firearm. I have a few extra shotguns so you never know.  would also take bulk fishing gear, old stuff, tackle etc"

You're not likely to find a handgun with a four inch barrel that shoots any straighter than this one. Field stripping is a snap, pull down on the trigger guard, then pull the slide straight back and lift it off. 

Comes with a Ruger hard case, two 12 rd. magazines, Allen's Gunglove IWB holster, and three sets of grips - factory plastic grips plus two sets of custom Marschal's wood grips. (the darker set of wood grips have a small crack, but this does not effect their usability and is not really noticeable).

FTF in South Tulsa, West Tulsa, Sand Springs, Sapulpa, Jenks, Glenpool area preferred. 

$300 or best offer. Alternatively, I would be willing to take $220 for just the gun, two mags, and the factory plastic grips.

Like new with original box. A friend bought this pistol new, fired a few rounds to test function, then saw a 4513TSW he wanted instead and sold it to me. I also fired a few rounds to test function. VERY LOW ROUND COUNT (under 100). Gun is like new.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with the 3913 series, it is considered by many to be one of the finest compact 9mm pistols ever made. Single stack thinness and flawless reliability. This is not the LadySmith version -- this is the seldom seen Tactical version with the light rail. Pistol has aggressively textured black grips, Novak 3-dot sights, shaved hammer, and an ambi-decocker. Comes with 4 new factory 8 rd mags - 1 flat base and 3 with finger extension. After testfiring it I purchased a new Streamlight TLR-3 which is mounted on the rail. Light comes with multiple keys if you want to put it on a different weapon.

This is the BEST nightstand pistol you can get in this caliber. Light is very bright and easy to use one-handed. Pistol has an alloy frame and stainless slide. Pistol is rated for +P ammunition. Traditional double action with first shot DA (10#) and all subsequent shots SA (3#) with an ambi decocker/safety.

I will try to get pics up tomorrow. In the meanwhile, you can see a photo of the TSW at the following link which also reviews this pistol:
http://www.rohrbaughforum.com/sw3913tswreview.pdf

I am asking $575 CASH for this like new pistol in the box with light and 4 mags and a 50 rd box of Winchester T-series ""law enforcement only"" ammo.

Really not looking for trade offers at this time (might consider a LCP as a partial trade).  Please, no lowball offers.  This is a very reasonable price for a minty TSW with light and extra mags.  The gun alone is worth more than 600.

WILL NOT SHIP. 
FTF in greater Denver area only (willing to travel a reasonable distance to meet). 
Cash only.  CO residents only.  No bad guys -- this is a good guy pistol.

Information From Web Site 

Mueller™ Introduces the World's Newest and Most Advanced Rifle Scope

From Turkey to Big Game, the Multi-Shot has it all and was designed specifically for hunters who need the versatility of a multi-purpose scope. We feel it is by far the most unique and versatile scope ever developed. What sets the Multi-Shot 2-7×32 apart from anything else on today's market is the advanced technology and versatility implemented into the design. The Multi-Shot can be used on virtually any type of firearm because of the multi-purpose reticle design.
The Mutli-Shot is an outstanding crossbow scope for big game hunting too.
The Multi Purpose Cross Hair

The outer circle was designed for use with shot type loads fired from shotguns, for example when turkey hunting. The circle will cover 15? @ 40 yards on 2× magnification. When sighting in shot type loads, adjust windage and elevation so the most dense pattern is centered in the circle. This assures the most dense portion of your pattern will hit your intended target.
The outer circle can also be used as a rangefinder and bullet drop compensator for slug guns and muzzleloaders. We are well aware that once these heavy loads reach a certain distance they begin dropping extremely fast so knowing your yardage can be the difference between a good clean kill or a potential miss.
The dot was designed for larger game animals such as Deer, Elk and Bear. The center dot will only cover 1? at 100 yards making it ideal for the big game hunter. Sighting in is done in the same manner as a standard rifle scope.
Mueller has gone one step farther by designing the dot so it can also be illuminated during low light situations, giving you an instant red dot aim point. This new design will also solve the problem of having your reticle blend in with dark targets such as a black bear or dark background objects during low light."

The pistol has a 4” octagon barrel, and has a very prominent British Broad Arrow mark on the top strap, and, in typical British fashion, it has British proof marks all over the receiver. The pistol has the original lanyard ring in the butt. The bore is a little dark, but it is OK, and the double action pull, while a bit stiff, is manageable, and the cylinder turns and locks up tightly. Finish condition is about 90%, with mostly holster wear, and there is a small scratch on the left side of the barrel. There is no pitting. The original grips rate about 90% also. The right grip appears to have had a professional repair near the bottom. This is a very collectible Webley, and it will fill a nice niche in your collection.

Original retail price $2800 bought on sale for $2174 and $2326 after taxes. Size 7 14k White Gold with a raised Trillion Cut( http://www.diamondsonweb.com/information/trillion-cut-diamonds.mhtml ) Center stone .4 Carats. Can you say big?
All stones are eye clean and I was unable to see inclusions with a 10X jewelers loop. Not a professional so I won't try and tell you the actual clarity measurements. Center stoned is complimented by 7 .085 carat (approx) diamonds in channel setting positioned with the corners up and down so they all touch corners in a a line. There is even a diamond under the main stone that increases the incredible fire the main stone already has. Ring comes with a Lifetime Rhodium plating and diamond warranty from Kay Jewelers. This is very useful being that a rhodium dip is around $30 right now and the average ring needs dipped every 6 months of wear to keep the luster. That alone saves you $60 a year that is $600 in ten years!!! This ring was a limited production ""showcase ring"" very few of these were made by Kay Jewelers, very hard to find another like it. Would hold onto it but my wife wants to take up shooting as a hobby so we are looking to get some start up cash to do so. If you want to see the ring we can meet at Kays in the mall or another similar safe place. More pics available."

Rifle is lightly used, around 500 rounds through it. I only used it at the range, so it is well cared for - and a good shooter too. It's a 580 series, so it's made with all the new tooling and has a heavy barrel. It's a nice shooter.

It's in a Choate stock, which has just been bedded by a Ruger specialist out in Montana. It's a nice bedding job. It also has a recoil buffer installed.

The stock is fixed with a pistol grip. It's very light and makes the whole thing a very light and handy rig. Has all Ruger metal parts installed. Lighter than a modern AR and great as a home defender.

not many made. this one has about 20 rounds run through according to previous owner. I have not shot it, its too pretty. want to move it so selling it cheap (as cheap as I will go) - comes with everything from the factory including all paperwork - registration has never been filled out. I like it but am looking to get something different in another realm than revolvers. this is modeled after the 27-2 and has a machined top strap - gold front sight - there are no scratches on the nickel anywhere - it's looking good.$1300 includes priority shipping to your ffl. and for all you purest - IT DOES HAVE A LOCK .

I am now looking to trade or sell it for a Glock 19 or 26.

I've only shot exactly 150 rounds of Winchester .40 S&W through the pistol during the post-purchase test at the Eagle-1 Law Enforcement Supply Range in Raleigh.

The only modifications I've made to the Glock 23 are a new Ghost Inc. 3.5 lb. trigger connector [ http://www.ghostinc.com/c=pEinJpQXJqKy0dz3KY7KMRvFJ/category/35_std_connector/ ] and Slipstream Weapons Grease [ http://www.crusaderweaponry.com/shop.php?id=1 ] throughout the slide of the pistol to increase accuracy and weapons life. I've kept the original trigger connector should you prefer the stock Glock 23 trigger pull. If you would like to remove the Slipstream Weapons Grease from the internals of the pistol, a quick wash with some degreaser would suffice.

If you do trade for the pistol, I will throw in an extra Glock 23 magazine, the original pistol case and accessories [including the two original magazines], 5 Italian Made .40 S&W ""Snap Caps"" for practice, 100 rounds of American Made FMJ .40 S&W ammunition, an 8 fl. oz. bottle of Pro-Shot 1 Step Gun Cleaner & Lubricant, a gently used Pro-Shot .40 S&W Pistol Cleaning Kit and an unused Camelbak Tranformer Tactical Backpack [ http://www.camelbak.com/Military-Tactical/Packs/Transformer.aspx ---- A $125.00 value in itself! ]. !!!NEW INCENTIVE: I WILL THROW IN A NEW PISTOL SIZED ELECTRONIC AND KEY ENTRY GUN SAFE IN ADDITION TO THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED FREE GEAR!!!

***I am asking for a new or gently used [less than 1,000 rounds] GENERATION 3 Glock 19 or 26 semi-automatic pistol in exchange for my barely used GENERATION 3 Glock 23 semi-automatic pistol.***

My only stipulation is that you drive to my city of residence, Durham, within the next week and a half to purchase the pistol. We can also meet at Eagle-1 Law Enforcement Supply [ http://eagle1supply.com/ ] to complete the transaction if you feel more comfortable there. I have a two month Gold Membership pass to their range and would be more than happy to allow you to try out the pistol there before purchase.

I hope that you're interested in my offer; Please e-mail me as soon as possible if you're willing to trade. I'll e-mail you back my cell phone number and we can coordinate any loose details.

I was recently offered a trade for an ACOG which was a FAKE, but the seller tried to tell me it was ""$1,200-$1,300 new"".  In reality he had a Chinese knockoff which probably cost about $75.

Just because it says ""Trijicon ACOG"" does not make it real!!

How to spot a fake:  If the reticle can change colors from green to red--it's fake.  Real ACOGs use tritium and fiber optics, which cannot change color with the push of a button."
