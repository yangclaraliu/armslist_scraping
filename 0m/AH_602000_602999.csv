Both the Alexander Henry forend and the buttstock are made of the highly figured walnut Ruger used on these guns back in the early days. I honestly can't tell that the gun has ever been fired except at factory test. I can't find a mark on it anywhere. The Bore and Chamber are MINT and the gun is 100% Mechanically perfect. It is also 100% original and unaltered in any way. The #1's that Ruger made during this early time period are legendary. They are known for thier extreme accuracy and exceptionally fine materials and workmanship. The new ones aren't even close to the Vinatge guns like this one. Ruger stopped making the 1S 300 Win Mag back in 2003 and only started making them again this year. This one would be a fine addtion to any #1 collection or a REALLY great hunting gun for ANY Big Game on the planet! It Includes the Original Box, Instuction Manual, Foam Padding and celophane bag.

Bolt carrier group (BCG) & charging handle included 
near monolithic upper, 4 rail 
floating forearm 
deep flash hider 
working forward assist 
very smooth shooter

The top rail is 2pc full length, from flash hider to charging handle. The forearm is a floating (doesn't touch the barrel) 4 rail that is heavily vented. It also has 3 rail covers so you can hold it comfortably without an attached grip. It has a deep flash hider (like the flaming pig). The bolt carrier has the longer rear rail to keep the bolt action more reliable. The AR-15 forward assist works. This lower is legally a handgun. I can sell that also if you want it. Maybe $775 for a complete firearm.

I took it out and test fired it's first 20rds. My 9.5"" upper kicked like a small mule & was a fireball. This one at 7.5"" rides VERY smooth to the point I didn't believe the first shot. My friend shot better with this than his own .40cal handgun and said it was because his kicks harder. It's an amazingly smooth shooter. But my (ex!) girlfriend doesn't get to keep it so I'm selling it.

Private sale, cash purchase. If you buy the lower then like a gun show, show you live in state.


Thank you

This event is open to everyone.  Project Appleseed is an activity of The Revolutionary War Veterans Association, a 501(c)(3) all volunteer, non-partisan, non-profit organization, dedicated to teaching every American our shared heritage and history as well as traditional rifle marksmanship skills.  You may shoot anything from a .22 rimfire (the Ruger 10/22 and Marlin 795 are popular) to a centerfire such as an AR, AK, SKS, M1A or M1.  You will shoot approximately 250 rounds per day as you try to qualify as a Rifleman (210 Points) on a modified version of the AQT (Army Qualification Test) course of fire.


There are only 20 slots open for this clinic, so pre-registration is highly encouraged to make sure a spot on the line is reserved for you.  Politics are not discussed at Appleseed shoots, except for the politics of 1775. 


Some of the things you will learn-
Safe Rifle Handling - 4 safety rules
The 6 Steps to Firing the Shot
Building Solid Shooting Positions; Standing, Sitting and Prone.
Steady Hold Factors
Use of the GI Web Sling
Natural Point of Aim
Sight adjustment using inches, minutes and clicks
The Story of Our Nation’s Birth
The Lessons of April 19, 1775
The Debt We Owe to Our Forefathers
The Duty We Owe to Our Posterity

I love the beretta and the wife loves it even more but  I want something that looks more aggressive rather than just cool..and since i have 2 of the handguns the wife will still be happy..this is a name brand Beretta so I'm not looking for cheap Chinese knock off ...that pretty much leaves guns like the ruger 10/22 tactical...S&W MP..HKMP5 or something just as dependable.I have just under 600.00 invested in the gun,scope and carbine conversion kit so if you want to make a cash offer keep that in mind.Go check out the Beretta NEOS...its a real unique gun.Also..both the gun and carbine kit come in their original boxes with all the paper work.Keep in mind that this is actually TWO guns in one..A pistol and a long distance shooting riffle all in one."

-I keep it for home defense. It is a well built, versatile American sidearm

""The P90, as is the case with most current designs, is made for safer operation under stressful and harsh conditions, safer meaning additional design consideration for protection against accidental discharge in the event the firearm is struck, dropped or while its owner might be in a struggle for possession of the firearm. Double action operation, decocking capability, captive inertial firing pin, trigger and sear disconnects, even finishes that keep materials in working order longer with less maintenance all contribute to this objective ""(http://www.realguns.com/archives/182.htm)

Rifle has a built-in 5 round magazine and has been outfitted with a Tasco 3-9X32 power scope. This Mauser has the desirable Colombian crest engraved just forward of the bolt. The Colombian's during the war were issued European 7mm Mausers in which they converted to the readily available American 30-06 round. This rifle would be the ultimate hunting rifle for the upcoming deer and elk season. There is one slight hiccup with the rifle though. Once the chambered round is fired, it is slightly difficult to open the bolt back up. (Some shots required the use of two hands to open the bolt) I've had the fired brass evaluated, and been told this is a head-spacing issue with the barrel, and that I myself, or a gunsmith, should fix this by reaming the barrel. I am not particularly interested in spending the time to get this rifle in perfect condition. I would like to add that it does shoot and operate as it should, just definitely not as smooth or safe as it should be. It is extremely accurate and was hitting clay pigeons at 200 yards last weekend. Also included with the rifle, is approx. 90 rounds or so of new Lake City 150gr 30-06 rounds. The action on this rifle is a European FN action and is highly sought after to be used in high-end custom sporterized rifles because it is fully capable of handling any round available; including the high powered 300 win mag or 300 weatherby rounds. The action alone is worth $200 and the ammo itself is worth easily $100. I would prefer to actually trade. I'm looking for anything and everything. Shoot me a trade offer, the worst I can do is politely say ""no thanks."""

I don't need this AK47 also so I am putting it up for trade. This is the only 22 that Kalashnikov approved and it has his name stamped on the side. It was sold by ATI in the US, but is made by German Sport Guns in Germany. It includes a couple of tools that came with it, one 25rd magazine, the box, and a manual. There are a couple of light scratches on the wooden stock that must have happened in the box, but they are very minor. All the wood is real wood and not plastic made to look like wood.
I am interested in trading for the list below. I can put cash with my trade if needed and I have another posting for two 22 rifles that I could include for the right trade. The link to that posting is at the bottom of this posting.

I don't need this AK47 also so I am putting it up for trade. This is the only 22 that Kalashnikov approved and it has his name stamped on the side. It was sold by ATI in the US, but is made by German Sport Guns in Germany. It includes a couple of tools that came with it, one 25rd magazine, the box, and a manual. There are a couple of light scratches on the wooden stock that must have happened in the box, but they are very minor. All the wood is real wood and not plastic made to look like wood.
I am interested in trading for the list below. I can put cash with my trade if needed and I have another posting for two 22 rifles that I could include for the right trade. The link to that posting is at the bottom of this posting.

I bought this last week and never even got a chance to sight it in. Yesterday I came across a deal for a M&P 15-22 that I couldn't pass up so I had to pick it up. I don't need this AK47 also so I am putting it up for trade. This is the only 22 that Kalashnikov approved and it has his name stamped on the side. It was sold by ATI in the US, but is made by German Sport Guns in Germany. It includes a couple of tools that came with it, one 25rd magazine, the box, and a manual. There are a couple of light scratches on the wooden stock that must have happened in the box, but they are very minor. All the wood is real wood and not plastic made to look like wood.
I am interested in trading for the list below. I can put cash with my trade if needed and I have another posting for two 22 rifles that I could include for the right trade. The link to that posting is at the bottom of this posting.

I am Selling my Mossberg 500A Mariner. I bought this brand new straight from the Manufacturer. I Had it shipped to Eastside Arms in Bellevue in 2006 for $450 plus tax. Right now it's in ""Like New"" condition with under 50 rounds having gone through it. I no longer need it due to kids.

Very quick & easy transaction. I will require a bill of sale that will be for our protection only. I'll provide 2 copies, one for me and one for you. I will only need your Full name, address and signature. That's it. 

Great Deal for a Very great Rifle!  


 Details:
- MarineCoat finish
- Six-shot model
- Designed for harsh environments
- 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel
- Synthetic Forend & Butt stock
- Chambers 12 gauge 2 3/4"" or 3"" shells

   Mossberg's 500 pump-action shotguns offer an amazing amount of gun for an unbeatable price. The variety of stock, barrel and finish options alone would assure the place of the 500 in the hearts of outdoorsmen. But, of course, its performance in the field goes a long way in cementing its reputation with millions of hunters as well."

No trades & low-ballers will not get a response (paid $850 for everything and never got it to the range-my loss = your gain!).

The red dot does not match up well with my astigamatism. I bought before testing it out and now am selling since I bought a new Leupold scope to run instead of the red dot. 

$250 shipped for the red dot and the two mounts. You'd pay about $200 (fastfire II), $75 for the AR-F3 and $65 for the other mount if bought new. The AR-F3 mount comes with an extra battery storage compartment as well as an adjustment tool compartment so it's really handy and light on your AR. It cowitnesses with your iron sights also (no lower 1/3 though with standard A2 front sight). You can also mount a cheaper micro red dot on the mounts e.g. primary arms so you can run the Burris on an AR and the other with the picatinny on something else. 

I've attached a few generic photos but can attach actual photos if requested. I just haven't gotten around to taking pictures of it yet and since it is LNIB I figured the website's photos were good enough. I've also attached Burris' product guide so you can see the technical details.

“THE 22SPARROW IS THE FIRST SILENCER IN THE WORLD TO OFFER THE PATENT PENDING MULTI PART CONTAINMENT (MPC) TECHNOLOGY, WHICH ALLOWS THE 22SPARROW TO BE EASILY DISASSEMBLED FOR CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE AFTER HEAVY USE.
Because the .22 LR round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time, it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue, .22 silencers must be disassembled for cleaning and regular maintenance.
Until Silencerco introduced the 22Sparrow, the only .22 silencers that could be disassembled for cleaning required a cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds. However, often the components of those silencers would be fused together and unable to come apart. Competitor products on the market have baffles in their .22 silencers that must be removed by twisting the outer tube around the baffles and/or sliding the outer tube off of the baffles. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the outer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the outer tube, there is simply too much buildup of fouling and lead to remove the outer tube in that manner.
Silencerco solved this maintenance issue with MPC technology and made it possible for shooters to disassemble the 22Sparrow easily after heavy use without the need of tools. MPC technology revolutionized take-apart silencers by containing the lead and carbon debris to prevent the debris from reaching the outer tube. This innovative design is achieved by applying two tube halves before sliding the outer tube on the rest of the assembly. When disassembling, the outer tube can be easily removed, and the tube halves are free to pull away from the baffles without having to rotate or slide. Just pull off the tubes, clean the components, and reassemble.” –silencerco.com"

-Winchester 1200 magnum. Chambered for 2 ¾ - 3” magnum shells. Barrel has been sawed off to the minimum legal length – 18 ½”. The barrel has been painted high heat flat black. Frame is aluminum and has been polished to a mirror-like finish. All components and parts have been reblued and are corrosive resistant. It has a new trigger, sear assembly, and trigger guard. These parts cost a total of $60. It also has an Advanced Technologies Inc. (ATI) 6 position collapsible, tactical pistol grip stock – valued at $60. I just recently purchased a magazine tube extension for a 7 + 1 round capacity - $20. Haven’t shot it with the new magazine extender, but the barrel lines up perfectly with it. Also comes with all the original parts including the accessories to fit the pistol grip on a Remington 870 or Mossberg. Also comes with a SPEEDFEED stock, which aren’t cheap! Even comes with a nylon, 5 shell stock holder and a box of 3” magnum shells! I have all receipts. Valued at: $400

-Marlin 39-A lever action .22 rifle. Has a weaver ¾” detachable scope. I checked to serial numbers on this gun and it is an antique – made in 1947! Good condition for a ’47. You would not believe it by the looks of it, I know I didn’t! Valued at: $500

Convert your FACTORY STOCK GLOCK* Handgun into a .22 LR. with an Advantage Arms Conversion Kit

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT: Six great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

1. The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK OEM sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation.

2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN

The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3. INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm.

4. FINISH All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot. This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice."

This is a German made copy of the original WWII German STG 44 except in affordable .22LR caliber.  I have two of these and intended to put this one away but have decided instead to trade or sell it.  The STG 44 was arguably the world's first assault rifle, and was nicknamed ""Sturmgewehr"" or ""Storm Rifle"" by Hitler himself.  This rifle has the same heft and feel of the original and looks super cool too.  I will consider interesting trades and I may be a little flexible in the price but please no lowball offers.  Must be willing to meet locally for FTF transaction."
