OVERVIEW:


âWhy yes, thatâs really five shots.â Tell your friends itâs genetics. Fact is, when it comes to precision, thereâs no finer pedigree in the industry than RemingtonÂ® varmint rifles. And with the introduction of our new Model 700â¢ SPSâ¢ Varmint, staking claim to our legendary accuracy is a more attainable feat than ever.



The Model 700â¢ SPSâ¢ Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because itâs built on the Model 700â¢ action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence.


Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity caliber offerings, including the hot new 17 Remington Fireball. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation. And sharp predator eyes wonât spot the tough, non-reflective matte blued finish on the barrel and receiver. Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700â¢ SPSâ¢ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.

I've got a Weatherby mk. V in excellent condition (based on the NRA condition standards), the only flaws are a few little chips on the stock and a tiny fleck of rust near the end of the muzzle.  The chips on the stock are only cosmetic in nature, it's a synthetic stock so no real damage is done.  The gun is incredibly solid and shoots amazingly.  It still has a very positive edge on the extractor and ejects very easily.  It has a ported barrel to assist with recoil control.  Less than 50 rounds have been put through it and the bore is nice and bright with sharp lands and grooves.  The trigger pull is crisp, like breaking glass, and the bolt has a weighty heft to it.  It comes with a padded hard-shell case, 14 rounds of .300 Weatherby Magnum ammunition, and an approximately $600 Nikon brand scope.  I do not recall the magnification on the scope and I wasn't able to get a good picture of the bore due to only having a cellular phone camera, but it's in excellent shape.  I'm asking $1,800.00 for it.  It was over $2,000.00 when it was purchased (including the scope).

This would make a fantastic hunting or target rifle as it is very accurate and very well made.  The only reason I'm parting with it is because I'm in desperate need of money and I know it's worth what I'm asking.

Please feel free to ask any questions if you interested in buying, but make sure to read my post before you do.  If you decide you'd like to purchase it, please contact me by email and we can work out an appropriate time and place to meet."

At first glance, the Steyr AUG (also known as StG77) looks odd for a number of reasons. The magazine is behind the trigger, making it bullpup, there is a vertical hand grip up front and there is a standard 1.5x zoom scope. It may seem like this weapon is something out of a sience fiction movie, but infact this weapon has been in service since its creation in 1977. This weapon was designed to be a break out of the normal assault rifle. The main purpose of this was to make this weapon bullpup. For example: If there was 2 rifles, 1 bullpup and 1 traditional with both the same barrel lengths, the bullpup would be shorter but would still have the same accuracy as the traditional rifle because the barrel goes down further into the gun. This gives the user a shorter profile and because of this, many special forces around the world use it. The Steyr AUG A1 comes with a non removable 1.5x scope which is very useful for longer ranges. The front hand grip aids in better handling for longer ranges, so with this weapon the user is capable of great accuracy with it. Another useful feature of the AUG is interchangable barrels. If there is a firefight thats taking place at long range and a user has a Steyr AUG with too short of a barrel, the user can rather quickly get out a longer barrel and put it on. The Steyr AUG uses 5.56x45mm ammunition or for the submachine gun variant, the 9mm round. The Steyr AUG can accept 30 or 42 round box magazines and a nice feature of some magazines is that they are clear plastic so the user can see how many rounds they have left."

 The MCU-2/P was used extensively during the Gulf War along side the U.S Army M17A2. The MCU-2/P was later upgraded to the MCU-2A/P when a microphone connector was added to the voice-mitter assembly. No longer in production, these masks are highly desired for their strong and tight grip as well as their super-slim lines. Unlike the MSA advantage 1, the MCU-2/P gas mask can use a standard NATO 40mm filter, ballistic polycarbonate outer lens, and a drinking straw attachment.

Excellent condition, 7.62x39, all matching numbers of course, chrome lined barrel.  Comes with two mags, the original (which has a little surface spotting but to be expected for it's age and easily fixed) and a Promag.

Calculates your trajectory
Illuminates your perfect holdover 

No more guessing yardage or fumbling with a shaky handheld rangefinder. No more losing sight of your trophy. No more guessing holdover. The Eliminator knows the precise horizontal distance to your trophy and exactly what your cartridge will do. Eliminator lights a 1/3 MOA illuminated aiming dot showing exactly where your shot will go. With The Eliminator, just Range, Aim, and Fire.

Starting with the field-proven and bright crystal-clear optics of the original Burris LaserScope, The Eliminator provides a sophisticated yet very simple and accurate means of tailoring the scopeâs trajectory compensation to virtually any cartridge. 

Sophisticated Technology Made Simple, Simple, Simple.

Simply enter one of the 123 drop numbers into the Eliminator. In a split second, the Eliminator factors in the distance, the angle of the shot, and the ballistics of your cartridge or load, and presents a lighted dot for the perfect holdover.

Ballistics Tables Made Simple

All you need to know is the drop in inches at 200 yards when sighted-in at 50 yards, or the drop in inches at 500 yards when your cartridge is sighted-in for 100 or 200 yards. Burris provides this âdrop numberâ for more than 1,900 commercial cartridges. With your drop number established, you decide if you need or prefer to sight-in at 50, 100 or 200 yards.


Programming Made Simple

1. First, push the Main Button (left side of scope) to turn on the electronics. Then push the Main Button once more to get three dashes (â â â) in the range area.

2. Next, push the Forward Arrow button (right side of scope) then the Main Button. Hold simultaneously for 6 seconds to enter Set-Up Mode.

3. Select either (Y)ards or (M)eters, press the forward button.

4. Select a (0) 50 yard sight-in, (1) 100 yard sight-in distance or (2) 200 yard sight-in distance, then press the forward button.

5. Select the two-digit Drop Number (04 thru 90) and press the back button. Youâre done!

Precision Made Simple

Sight-in your gun at your selected sight-in distance of either 50, 100 or 200 yards. Then verify point of impact by actual shooting at 200 or 500 yards. Depending on the exact ammo performance, your gunâs barrel length, the elevation, and any extreme temperatures, you might need to increase or decrease your Drop Number by a couple of digits for exacting performance. 

Life Made Simple

Your programming is stored in the scope no matter the condition of your battery and it will still remember your programming with no battery at all. 

The Hunt Made More Enjoyable and Successful

The Burris Eliminator LaserScope is in a league of its own. No other riflescope combines this level of quality, technology, accuracy, simplicity, repeatability and effectiveness. It will greatly increase the distance at which you can be confident in making an ethical shot. You do the hunting and shooting, the Eliminator will do the memorizing and calculating. The Eliminator is affordable and of a size and weight thatâs welcome for everyday field use. The revolutionary new Eliminator is a brilliant riflescope innovation that ensures long range hunting success.

 Parlor pistols and rifles (zimmerschutzen from German, ""room marksman"" or ""room shoot"") were popularized in the mid to late 19th Century, particularly in the Germanic countries, as a way to entertain guests, have family fun, and to increase one's shooting skills. Generally heavy barreled and often elaborately engraved rifles (zimmerbusche) were produced for clearly upscale clients. These generally used a Flobert (CB-Cap) cartridge chambered a few inches from the muzzle. Sometimes equally elaborate parlor pistols (zimmerpistole) were chambered for Flobert cartridges or simply used a percussion cap. In this country, a small, almost toylike parlor pistol was briefly manufactured by Remington in 1860.

Remington 700 Tactical 20"" Barrel, refinished in OD Green, does show some handling marks as it has been my deer rifle the last couple years, but that is of course purely cosmetic.  Internally it is near perfect, i've only put 300 rounds through it.  Has upgraded 7 round mag extension, sling, rear saddle, Harris Ultralight Bipod, rings and base mount.  Also, I had a gunsmith do an accuracy package on the bolt and trigger.  Trigger has zero creep, zero over travel and breaks like a glass rod at 2lbs.  Best trigger I have ever felt on any gun. It will shoot 1/4moa at 100 yards with 10 rounds, will shoot one ragged hole all day long.  By far the most accurate rifle I've ever seen and shot, only reason for parting with it is to fund an AR-10.

paid over 33 each on the clips and over 22 on the ammo,  plus the case and kit im well over 900 into this after taxes - prefer to sell to a ccw holder so i know you dont have a felony but first with cash takes this pkg. No you do not have to sign anything. Will not ship at all - face/face only and im willing to drive up to 30 min. from GB. 

If your not serious about the gun or offer dont waste my time with your dumb questions. I posted this on here a few months ago and recieved nothing but low offers of 6-650. This is a 10 round double stack mag not your typical 7 round single stack its hard to find at your local gun store.

This rifle has had at most 700 rounds through it all of them were flawless. I've got another m4 project in the works that this one needs to fund. It shoots good and the trigger feels great for a stock trigger. She has handled xm193, m855, some brass cased 72gr (I forget the brand), wolf 55 gr and wolf 62 grain ammo with out issue. It is dialed in well to shoot all types of ammo. Groupings at 100 yards are nice and tight with all of the above except the 72 gr. I ran out of that before I moved out to that distance I was mainly running the 72gr and closer range to make sure it cycled OK."

9mm

S&W 908s ..This was my first carry gun, they are hard to find, because they are IMO one of the BEST carry 9mm, EVER. S&W 908s, very slim singlestack 9mm (8+1), alloy frame makes it very light. It is compact, but big enough to be a real joy to shoot, VERY accurate. NEVER a FTF or FTE.... Has a safety/decocker and hogue grips. Feels like a glove in the hand. It comes with a crossbreed IWB holster. has some holster wear, not much.

Between these three guns, you should be ready for any carry situation...... I am not hurting for money (I would rather trade) so please NO lowball offers, I will ignore them. If you have a cash offer send me one, who knows how i am feeling at the time.

I am not real sure what I am looking for, so try me. I would like to try and stay with 9mm or 45acp ( that is all of the ammo I have) I will trade, one or all of them. I will be fair, if you are. Thanks...... I have more pics if you want to see them......"

Wood and Receiver on this gun are in exceptional condition.  Virtually Zero handling marks.  Hard to find 20ga 3"" mag with the long barrel.

The slight issue
The gun was stored with the barrel off and the barrel is slightly discolored below the ventrib.  I don't want to give the wrong impression as the barrel is not rust pitted or in bad shape.  The discoloring is so slight that I can't get it to show up on photos.  www.ahlmans.com in Morristown will strip and reblue the barrel for $75.  I have accounted for this in my price.

Uses the 7.62 x 39 cartridge that's good for plinking, hunting, targets, you name it; and the round is still very affordable so shooting this rifle is easy on the wallet.  This hasn't been shot much (I've got waaay too many rifles for each of them to get fully 'exercised'...lol.  And another project on the horizon necessitates this going up for sale.)

Comes with an upgraded ATI Monte Carlo stock for improved ergonomics.  Also has an add on muzzle brake (you can remove it with a hex key if you like) to reduce muzzle flare and recoil. 

Receiver was originally drilled/tapped on the left side for a scope mount when this rifle was imported.  No longer has the mount BUT the mounting holes are still there and there are hex head machine screws in place; if you want to add a firm/hold the zero mount to this rifle the hard part has been done!

 Has a five round detachable magazine installed (great for hunting when you've got a limit on how many rounds  your weapon can hold AND a 30 round metal detachable magazine as well.  

Bayo, with mounting screw and all hardware is included.  Bipod is included that can be installed/uninstalled in about three minutes depending on your preference.

Nice leather sling and three stripper clips to get you going are also part of the package.  Hard sided case to contain everything rounds out the offering.

Matching number on the trigger group, bolt carrier, and bolt; this isn't a ""parts gun"" that's been put together piecemeal.

IF you can find an SKS, you then have to find a nice one.  This is it!  Prices have escalated steadily but rather than play games of ""start high/negotiate like crazy"", I've got this priced at $395 cash, and that's both a fair AND a firm price.  First ""I'll take it"" at the listed price gets first shot.  I have more photos than Armslist allows to be posted, let me know if you want more and we'll go from there.  I'm around most of the weekend, with the exception of a graduation Saturday morning.  

I'd be happy to drive a bit to meet you if that helps, let's say as far north as Lomira, as far west as Johnson Creek, and to Hwy 20 in the Racine area as the ""circle of travel"".

You have to be old enough to purchase a rifle, have picture ID, and be willing to sign a bill of sale.  Thanks for looking."
