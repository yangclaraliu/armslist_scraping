The M6X Tactical Laser Illuminator was built for U.S. Special Operations personnel and designed to perform under the most rigorous conditions and survive the harshest environments. Because of this, the M6X is built to go as deep as 66ft. and still remain waterproof.

The M6X utilizes a Xenon bulb that delivers a peak output of 125+ lumens and is protected by the Shock Suppression System which is designed to handle the heavy recoil demands of today’s tactical loads. Powered by two (2) 3V 123 lithium batteries (included), the M6X has a run time of one (1) hour.

The M6X utilizes a red, class III visible laser with a range of 200 meters. The laser is adjustable for elevation and windage (using the supplied tool) allowing the user to zero in the laser.

The M6X features a 4 position selector switch in conjunction with a 3 position toggle switch removable long gun backplate. The selector switch turns to Lock-Out, Laser Only, White Light Only or White Light and Laser combined. Once the desired output is selected the M6X can be toggled to either Off, Momentary On or Constant On. The straight cord touch-pad remote, which is used on rifles and semi-auto shotguns, allows the user to activate the Momentary On feature. For pump action shotguns an optional curly cord remote is available.

The long gun backplate on the M6X is interchangeable with any other backplate designed for either M6X or M3X models, giving you greater versatility of application.

L-3 Insight Technology Incorporated offers two options for mounting the M6X to your firearm. The patented 1913 Slide-Lock® system allows for instant tool-free mounting and removal by simply sliding the unit onto the rail and locking it into place with the spring-loaded latchbar. The 1913 Slide-Lock mount is designed specifically for the true M1913 Mil-Spec Picatinny rail and also comes with two latchbars to insure proper fit.

The Rail-Grabber™ mount fits most rail configurations whether for a rifle, shotgun or a pistol. The Rail-Grabber interface utilizes a screw-adjustable locking plate that can be tightened to insure a rock solid fit. The Rail-Grabber mount is particularly recommended for heavy recoiling firearms.

For mounting the an M6X on shotguns not equipped with a rail, L-3 Insight Technology offers an optional Shotgun Adapter mounting bracket that attaches to the extended tube.

Peak Output: 125+ Lumens
Run Time: 1 Hour

This is built off of an Olympic Arms K16-SS that I had rebarreled with a CMMG 16"" 300 Blackout barrel 1:8 WASP with carbine length gas system. I also had installed a flash hider and a nice Midwest Industries low profile gas block installed. It has the quad rail and is fully floated. It has a total of 14 rounds down the pipe to sight it in. Everything else including the charging handle, BCG, etc are factory. This price does not include rail covers, optics or the lower, but let's face it, almost everything is for sale for the right price. Shipping is available for the upper.

Hard to beat 300 Blackout. Basically a semiautomatic 30-30 that takes all standard AR15 5.56 mags and parts. Swap out the upper and the ammo and you can have the best of both worlds with your existing AR platform.

Military grade New IN Box. Will not budge on the price much. May take a trade...May.... Retails for $489.99.

The M6X Tactical Laser Illuminator was built for U.S. Special Operations personnel and designed to perform under the most rigorous conditions and survive the harshest environments. Because of this, the M6X is built to go as deep as 66ft. and still remain waterproof.

The M6X utilizes a Xenon bulb that delivers a peak output of 125+ lumens and is protected by the Shock Suppression System which is designed to handle the heavy recoil demands of today’s tactical loads. Powered by two (2) 3V 123 lithium batteries (included), the M6X has a run time of one (1) hour.

The M6X utilizes a red, class III visible laser with a range of 200 meters. The laser is adjustable for elevation and windage (using the supplied tool) allowing the user to zero in the laser.

The M6X features a 4 position selector switch in conjunction with a 3 position toggle switch removable long gun backplate. The selector switch turns to Lock-Out, Laser Only, White Light Only or White Light and Laser combined. Once the desired output is selected the M6X can be toggled to either Off, Momentary On or Constant On. The straight cord touch-pad remote, which is used on rifles and semi-auto shotguns, allows the user to activate the Momentary On feature. For pump action shotguns an optional curly cord remote is available.

The long gun backplate on the M6X is interchangeable with any other backplate designed for either M6X or M3X models, giving you greater versatility of application.

L-3 Insight Technology Incorporated offers two options for mounting the M6X to your firearm. The patented 1913 Slide-Lock® system allows for instant tool-free mounting and removal by simply sliding the unit onto the rail and locking it into place with the spring-loaded latchbar. The 1913 Slide-Lock mount is designed specifically for the true M1913 Mil-Spec Picatinny rail and also comes with two latchbars to insure proper fit.

The Rail-Grabber™ mount fits most rail configurations whether for a rifle, shotgun or a pistol. The Rail-Grabber interface utilizes a screw-adjustable locking plate that can be tightened to insure a rock solid fit. The Rail-Grabber mount is particularly recommended for heavy recoiling firearms.

For mounting the an M6X on shotguns not equipped with a rail, L-3 Insight Technology offers an optional Shotgun Adapter mounting bracket that attaches to the extended tube.

Other Part No: EO511

The EOTech 511 is the economical solution that sacrifices very little. It includes many of the bells and whistles the EOTech is known for. It's smaller, lighter design is perfect for tactical environments at a more affordable price. This EOTech model uses N size batteries, a smaller battery versus the AA size models. Thus making this model a bit shorter in length. It is ideal for mounting in tighter places. Unlike other tubed sights, the EOTech 511, along with all other EOTech models, gives you a completely unobstructed field of view. This is due to the HUD (Heads Up Display) like reticle in the display. This display is similar to the ones found in todays fighter jets, allowing for fast target acquisition.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

 Don't get ripped off by people wanting $900 - $1500 for a used Saiga. If they paid too much for their firearm, then that's their problem. Do your research and don't get ripped off!

2/04/2012 .... I'm not Classic Arms or affiliated with them. I just received my Saiga today.  My point is too many ""honest"" people on AL want dishonest prices for their USED firearms. Of course there seems to be a lot of sellers who simply buy guns and then put them in their safe. ""Never fired! Only 20% above retail because I owned it! Get it now before it's gone!"" Month after month. What a joke. Pants must be combusting all over AL, thats why they keep Flagging my posts. Just be careful and do your research so you don't get ripped off! 

All those haters sending abusive emails, you're the scammers trying to sell your junk for 20%+ over retail. Here in The Chicagoland area there's a lot of FFL's doing transfers for around $25.
And that's still better than ""$600 OTD"" buddy."

I love this AR.  Awesome weapon.  I have to sell because I'm negative on my tax returns this year.  
Runs flawless, no miss fires, no miss loads, close to no kick at all with the PWS muzzle break.  I'm the 1st owner; I've put about 7 magazines though it (210 round).  All brass, never any steel ammo.  I paid $1100 at the Dixie Gun show last year.  This weapon comes with a lifetime warranty through Elite Arms, out of Thomasville NC.
I can knock $50 off the price and put on a standard bird cage flash hider.  The PWS break is $100 new.

Cash only.  1st come, 1st serve.  I've never sold a rifle before, so I'm going to want to meet at a local gun dealer for the exchange.  Just to make sure everythings on the level.

Reason for blurryness is from being probly less than 15 yards from target(4x optic, indoors b/c I live in the city) and also I'm sure trying to take a pic from a camera through a NOD doesn't help. I was very careful not to mess anything up on this, which leads me to the only fault. I popped the lens cap off in the pitch dark and one of the straps broke. You can see it in pic 2 of 42. I think some sort of epoxy glue or something would fix that. I let it wind down(bout 5 or so mins, enough to where I couldn't see a picture through teh eye piece) when I checked out the lens and also when I took a pic of it(the lens) earlier. I did a good bit of research before I even received so as to not mess anything up. It will mount about an inch lower if you remove the quick disconnect mount and install it directly to the claw mount. Mounted to the PTR, its just under 20lbs, too much for my scrawny ass haha. I sorta bought it on impulse and decided If I'm gonna spend that kind of money on an optic, it's gonna be what I really want, an ACOG Oh boy! If you want anymore pics or have questions feel free to ask. I may consider trades, doesn't hurt to ask. Phone number (920)sixsixfour-ten60"

All you need is sockets to use and they are very cheap and attach very easy. I do have hooks.
Also great to resell if you have time. With sockets these would cost way over 3k if not 4k. Im not even trying to get close to that. This could be a GREAT deal for somebody. I dont need these and im willing to trade for a few firearms preferably pistols.

One is up behind the shoulders (see picture to see how deep and wide it is, and the other is right below it all the way to the bottom of the coat – accessed by two side zippers. There is a strap around the waist on the inside that secures the coat nice and snug. I can’t read the tag, but I have taken measurements which should give you what you need to know. Pit to pit: 31” (chest 62”), pit to sleeve cuff: 24 ½”, and back of neck to bottom of coat: 33”. These are OUTSIDE dimensions, so with the thickness of the coat, it will be somewhat less on the inside. Best guess on the size would be a 2X or a 3X (guessing).

Stock has dents and dings in it, but is perfectly fine. THIS GUN NEEDS A NEW EXTRACTOR. It will sometimes fail to grab and eject the spent casing causing a jam. This doesn't occur all the time, but more than it should. That's the sign that it is wearing down, as I have already fixed this on another tacticool'd out one I acquired in a trade(easy fix, btw.....plenty of youtube videos to walk you through it.) Aside from the worn extractor, this is a smooth shooting, clean gun. This was the first .223 I got 9 years ago(used), and now I have 4 others, so I really have no interest in fixing this just to leave in the safe. My laziness/disinterest will benefit you if you're willing to swap out the extactor on your own. Would make a great ""truck/beater"" gun for farmer/rancher. I've fed this thing all kinds of steel over the years from Brown Bear to Tula, and it doesn't discriminate. Will cycle steel just as well as brass. That being said, it's also been cleaned regularly and has been sitting with a shiny bore for about 6 months now. Private party, no tax, paperwork, etc. No minors or felons. Prefer to trade for something that ISN'T A .223! Will trade up or down.

Extractor can be found here for 12.75+shipping. No special shipping or anything, part not considered a ""weapon.""

You can find them for less than $500, just google it to get an idea of the ball park going rate (and then remember you would have to pay shipping and handling as well). The sword has a little give in the handle and there are a few slight markings on the blade but you have to be right up on it to see them. This is a great display sword. It is hard to tell in the pictures but the designs on the blade are characters from Robin Hood (there are more detailed pictures online).

I do not know if you can go more than 10 pages without someone's life being on the line. Rating wise, the killing can be pretty graphic, I would describe the language as moderate, and there are themes that I would not recommend for children. I think the age range would be a mature 16 on up. Like I said before, these books are action packed (sometimes to the point of ridiculousness) and deal with survival in a post nuclear war world.

Contents of the medical pouch include: 2 2"" elastic bandage, 1 pill bottle, 3 iodine wipes, 3 alcohol wipes, 3 antiseptic wipes, 3 nice clean wipes, 2 4""x4"" gauze pads, 16 bandage strip 3""x1"", 2 bandage gauze 4"" x 4.1 yards, first aid instructions, 2 pair of gloves, 2 rolls of tape, 10 pain reliever, 1 instant ice pack, 3 absorbent pad 5""x9"", 2 Bulkee super pad, 1 pressure bandage 3""x3"", 2 first aid cream, 1 tweezers, 1 scissor, 1 lip treatment. Even empty, the molle pouch would be great for storage and handy to have around. The bag has sturdy stitching (one of the reasons I bought it in the first place) and appears to be waterproof (or at least water resistant) but since it hasn't seen the outside of my room since the day it was bought, I can't be sure. After looking at it again to make sure I describe it correctly, I am finding myself wanting to keep it more, but I really need to downsize and seeing as how the rest of my gear is in black, this just makes sense. If you wait too long, I may decide I just want to keep it, haha. I might consider a trade up or down on guns (henry goldenboy .22, ruger mark III hunter, new style p22, 10/22s, benelli sbe II, some other benellis, some mossberg or remington shotguns, ruger lcr, ruger lc9, ruger gunsite scout, and more) 5.11 gear, quality military gear, silver, quality knives (certain types of leathermans, crkts, kershaws, gerbers, busse, esee, and more), tools, a lot of different things. Just let me know what you have to trade or make a cash offer, worst I will say is no thanks. I can meet in Cedar Bluff, Turkey Creek, Hardin Valley, or Karns most days and somtimes at Mckays Used Books. See other ads. Thanks for your time."
