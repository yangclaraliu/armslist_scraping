I have changed a few things since last I posted it up.

I have a 100% new Bushmaster AR. Never has been fired, just put away. 

It is fully set up like my service rifle , down to each part. Every item on the rifle is brand new also , nothing has left the house since I bought it. If your looking for a 100% Mil Spec M4 this ones it, no extra crap added that the Army wouldnt use to make it look cool. Also this is not a frankenstein rifle with a "" jim bob lower and a jim jam upper "" that some dude or place put together.

Id rather trade for a basic model Colt M4 thats stamped Colt M4 5.56 mm with removable carry handle. I saw one I should have bought for 1k not long ago at a store. 
Id also partial trade for a Ruger 10/22 , Colt or S&W M4 in .22 cal , M1 Carbines, M1 Garands, M1903's not A3's , Real Military M1911's. Im a Military gun expert so please dont offer up a mix master rebuilt M1 Garand/Carbine , etc as an even trade.

This Bushmaster comes with everything you see:
All New and real
-New un issued cleaning kit
-3 30 round magazines, 1 new in plastic that came with the rifle
-Surefire light w/ NV cover and pressure switch
-Bushmaster sling

BUT PLEASE DONT TELL ME HOW CHEAP YOU CAN GET ONE AT A STORE OR ONLINE (MAKES ME THINK THERES A REASON WHY YOUR TRYING TO BUY MINE. FELON?

Decided to go another direction.  Up for sale is this excellent condition Sig556003 and/or Leupold 52155 CQ/T Mark 4 scope.  Rifle is upgraded to Swiss 551 forearm, Magpul CTR stock over the original folder.  Comes with one magazine (that's all it came with), sling attachment, Troy CQB sling, and boxes for both the Sig556 as well as the CQT.  (Rifle case on which the rifle is set is NOT included.)  I am willing to separate.  I bought both new, and can attest that the round count is under 200.  It's not seen classes, rain, or even dirt.

From Sig:  The Sig 556 features the same high performance two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system engineered by Sigs sister company Swiss Arms and marries it to a trigger housing that not only cuts the rifles weight by a pound but is designed to accept standard AR magazines. The Picatinny rail equipped receiver is made of high strength carbon steel with a durable wear resistant Nitron X rifle finish. The rifle comes equipped with a smooth two stage trigger. A 30 round magazine is supplied with each rifle. 

From Leupold:  Leupold Mark 4 CQ/T 1-3x14mm Scope 52155 is a revolutionary optical sight for tactical firearms, such imageas the AR15 and M16, that combines the strengths of a red dot sight and the variable-power rifle scope. Use Leupold Mark IV CQT Rifle Scope at 1x and it functions as a non-magnifying, illuminated sight for tactical scenarios or engaging targets at medium range. The illuminated reticle of 1-3x14 Leupold Mark IV CQT tactical sight can be used day or night (two reticle settings work with night-vision devices). Accessories attach directly to the Leupold scope's body. Leupold Close Quarter / Tactical Mark IV CQ/T 1 - 3x14mm Riflescope even offers specialized eye relief for the M16 cheek weld. Leupod Mark 4 Close Quarter/Tactical CQ-T Riflescope is available in Certified and Standard models. Certified models meet specific military & law enforcement requirements for waterproofing and other performance criteria.

I bought this and have fired 6 magazines through it on two separate occasions.  Looks great with only slight marks on the flash hider from removal.  I still have the original box, sling (never used), and case for the ACOG.  I really like the rifle, but have decided to go another direction.  I'll hate to see this go, as it is a fairly rare piece of equipment.  

I bought the magazines from Springfield.  They're in original paper with cosmoline on them still.  New.

Here is the description from Kel-Tec:  RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face.

And from Trijicon:  Trijicon ACOG 3.5x35 Scope, Dual Illuminated Green Horseshoe .308 M240 BDC Reticle w/TA51 Mount.  ACOG 3.5x35 Scope with Green Horseshoe BAC Reticle. Features dual illumination (Fiber optics provides daylight illumination and tritium illuminates reticle at night). The ranging reticle is calibrated for 7.62(.308 cal) flattop rifles out to 1200 meters.

Again, I really hate to get rid of this rifle, but I've set my sights on another.

This .38 Special version of the Smith 640 was made for only a few years.
S&W then went to making the .357 Mag version of this model. This .38spl 
version is sought after due to it's shorter barrel and lighter weight when
compared to the longer and heavier .357/640 model.

One of the very best snubbies ever for CCW use, and
ready for a lifetime of service.

Also comes with an NC-Star holosight, but the glass is cracked because of my clumsy cousin, so you'll probably want to replace the sight. ;)

I'll throw in a free rifle bag for it, too, if you'd like, since I don't have use for it any longer. It fits the WASR when the rail is not attached, but it's too narrow when the rail is attached.

This is a fairly inexpensive, highly reliable rifle. It'll take a beating and keep working flawlessly. I've put lots of rounds through it, from Remington hunting loads to cheap Tula target ammo, without a single malfunction. That's more than I can say for any other gun in my collection. 

Face-to-face transaction is a must.

Steel upper, polymer lower, faux intregal suppressor, 16"" barrel. 

In very good condition.  Only wear marks are from rail mount that was on the rifle.  Extremely reliable and accurate.  Will eat any cheap ammo you can put through it.  It is not ammo sensitive like the GSG copy. Comes with 1 original magazine, instruction manual and tool for adjusting ammo velocity, though I've never had to use it.  I've run 1200fps and 1650fps ammo through it fine.  I'd expect subsonic to run fine too, but never tried it.

If you are reading this ad, it is still available.

DO NOT ask me to meet you half way somewhere in a parking lot.  YOU MUST come to me to pick up. Bring a rifle bag with you, or I can throw in a basic hunting rifle bag for $10 extra.  No carrying it openly to your car.

Complete long range setup.  I have decided to go another long range route, but have very much enjoyed this very accurate combination for the 30-50 rounds I have through it.
* Savage 10FP with 26"" barrel, 308 / 7.62x51.
* Barrel threaded by Mike at Tornado Technologies.  One of the best in the business.
* Kevin Rayhill / Stockade Gun Stocks ""Prairie Dog / Tactical"" laminate stock with aluminum rails.  Has the adjustable cheek rest.
* Kevin Rayhill / Stockade bolt handle.
* Falcon Menace 4-14x44 FFP (First Focal Plane) scope.
* Rifle and scope have a coat of Krylon applied by yours truly.  If you don't like it, feel free to paint it again.  It's the beauty of Krylon.  :)

Rifle is very reliable and accurate.  Combination of stock and long barrel make it very stable.  I've put about 10 downrange sighting it in, then about 20 one day; during that day, the rifle would ring the 1/2 height IDPA target with boring regularity at ~350 yards."

I bought this with the intention of hunting with it but my hunting partner and I both had kids. 
This rifle comes with reloading components, (dies rcbs no shell holder, brass 40 or so, loaded ammo that is for component use only and factory ammo).


I'm sorry I took some horrible pictures but I will get better ones ASAP.
I am always interesed in trades particuallarly Ar, Ptr, hk clones. 
Thanks"

The main benefit of the BAR rail is to those who wish to have a suppressor inside of the rail or for those shooters who have large bear paw hands and who feel that skinnier rails are just too small ( the BAR is about the same circumference as a DD rail with the popular Magpul XTM covers). The 9” BAR rail weighs in at 370 grams (13.05 oz.) and has an ID of 1.79”.

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling.

But wait, there’s more! The BAR has 5 built in QD sockets (sling attachment points), allows for a continuous top rail, it’s compatible with many low profile gas blocks, and it’s made right here in the USA and backed by our LIFETIME WARRANTY!

NOTE: You will need to remove your front sight base and delta ring assembly for installation. The BAR rail system installs with a Standard USGI barrel nut wrench and supplied Torx wrench.

Up for sale is a like new Winchester 94AE Trapper chambered in .45 Colt. This is the more desirable tang safety version (no ugly push safety going through the receiver) and handy 16"" barrel. Comes with the receiver mounted sling swivel and hammer spur. Factory drilled and tapped for a scope mount. This would make a great first rifle for a kid or just a handy carbine for wife. I've shot (1) 20 round box through it since '02 and it's been in the safe ever since. Flawless except for a small ding in the wrist of the stock (didn't even scrape the finish off).

Looking to get $600 shipped or trade for a 7.62x39 Saiga (+ cash/trade on your end). Must have receiver dimples, barrel length doesn't matter. I prefer one that isn't converted and it can be used."

Spikes Tactical 13"" BAR Rail

The Spike's Tactical 13.2” BAR Rail is a 1pc free floating quad-rail that’s machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum with a barrel nut machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and finished in type III Hardcoat Anodizing on the rail and barrel nut. The main benefit of the BAR rail is to those who wish to have a suppressor inside of the rail or for those shooters who have large bear paw hands and who feel that skinnier rails are just too small ( the BAR is about the same circumference as a DD rail with the popular Magpul XTM covers). The 13.2"" has an ID of 1.79”.

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling.

But wait, there’s more! The BAR has 5 built in QD sockets (sling attachment points), allows for a continuous top rail, it’s compatible with many low profile gas blocks, and it’s made right here in the USA and backed by our LIFETIME WARRANTY!

Spike's Tactical Dynacomp ""Shorty"" Extreme

The Spike’s Tactical Dynacomp Short is a 5.56 muzzle device designed to reduce recoil impulse and muzzle climb to provide faster follow up shots. The Dynacomp's accomplish this by balancing the direction of the blast along the vertical (upward) and perpendicular planes of the muzzle to lower muzzle rise, while the end of the device restricts forward energy to reduce parallel recoil.

The ports on the Dynacomp are ball dimpled for smooth expansion of gases and rapid heat dissipation. The front of the device is 0.25"" thick to better handle the abuse of full auto fire. The entire device is Melonite treated to enhance these characteristics and provide a slick black finish.

Threaded for 1/2x28” barrels
Machined from 303 Stainless Steel
Black Melonite finish
Ball dimpled expansion ports

Stock set was darkened with tan rit dye because I thought the original colour was too bright....You can revert back again if you wish but this shade of tan is alot more desert tan than the stock arsenal colour.

Vltor MUR-1A Upper Receiver w/ Bolt Assist, Port Door, Forward Assist & M4 Feedramps

The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly.

The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available.

The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door.

Spikes Tactical 13"" BAR Rail

The Spike's Tactical 13.2” BAR Rail is a 1pc free floating quad-rail that’s machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum with a barrel nut machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and finished in type III Hardcoat Anodizing on the rail and barrel nut. The main benefit of the BAR rail is to those who wish to have a suppressor inside of the rail or for those shooters who have large bear paw hands and who feel that skinnier rails are just too small ( the BAR is about the same circumference as a DD rail with the popular Magpul XTM covers). The 13.2"" has an ID of 1.79”.

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling.

But wait, there’s more! The BAR has 5 built in QD sockets (sling attachment points), allows for a continuous top rail, it’s compatible with many low profile gas blocks, and it’s made right here in the USA and backed by our LIFETIME WARRANTY!

I just sold my AR and have the following ammo for sale.

212 loose rds of Federal Lake City 5.56 NATO XM193 55 gr FMJ: $70

150 boxed rds of M1A2 5.56 NATO 55 gr FMJ ball ammo: $50

200 rd packs of Federal AE 223 Remington 50 gr JHP: $70/pack.  I have a total of 11 packs available.

All the ammo is factory new and brass cased.  I picked up the M1A2 ammo at a local gun shop withing the last few months.  I'm guessing it's mil-surplus, just not sure where from.

I will sell it all for $800 cash money, no lower.  Feel free to make me a decent cash or trade offer for part of it if you don't want it all.  I won't give it away though.  No sense in me keeping around ammo I don't have a gun for.  I'm open to trades, but cash is king...I have a Benelli shotgun I recently purchased to pay for.

This desireable set is based on the Winchester 101 ""baby frame"" receiver (smaller and lighter than their 12 gauge receiver) and it handles like a dream.  Each barrel set is 28"", has its own walnut forend, and is choked skeet/skeet.  Wood was professionally refinished by the gent who does all the custom stock work for Joel Etchen Guns, a company that specializes in customizing competition shotguns.  This shotgun has been used very little, is in wonderful condition, and locks up very tight.  I estimate the blueing to be at least 95% and probably closer to 97-98%.  Buttstock has 1/4"" aluminum spacer and is fitted with a Kick-eez recoil pad.  Length of pull is 14 1/4"".  The set comes cased in a Browning Travel Vault for true brute protection.  I've admired these sets for about 14 years and this is one of the very best I've seen.  This is an heirloom quality shotgun that you can enjoy and pass on to a lucky heir to enjoy.  I prefer payment by bank check or money order but will also accept a personal check.  If paying by personal check, I will ship item when your check clears my bank.  Due to value and weight of this item (~35 lbs, cased) shipping/insurance will be $80 to lower 48 states.  If actual shipping costs are less, you'll get a check in the mail for the difference.  If more, I'll cover it.  Feel free to contact for more info or pictures."
