I had the bolt bent to put on a scope and use leupold base and rings to mount simmons scope. I lengthened the buttstock, thinned the stock, removed and filled the useless accessories, cut the stock shorter in a tactical look and blacked the whole stock out flat black. I also machined a couple recoil suppressors, cut the bad end of the barrel off, recrowned and threaded for the suppressors. I also have three boxes of shells and two boxes of cases.

I bought this a few months ago planning to use it on a AR build. Since i no longer have the AR I no longer need this Eotech. This sight is 100% authentic registered Eotech weapons sight. I have removed the sight and installed batteries for a function check and just like the last 2 Eotechs i have owned the quality and craftsmanship of this sight is amazing. I mainly bought this 512 beacuse it takes standard AA batteries which can be found everywhere and it is a bit cheaper since it isnt NV capable.
I am in no hurry to sell this but i would like to get rid of it to help fund my new project.
I am asking 400 dollars which is a little less then what i picked it up for, Sight still has a 2 years warranty through Eotech but ive never seen one malfunction.

Below is what I have for trade.  I can include cash for the right deal.

1. Rock River AR-15: This is an upgraded M4 style (military tacitical style with short, lightweight barrel). It has an upgraded RRA Operator stock (as opposed to the standard RRA tactical stock on the unfired AR), a free float quad rail (as opposed to the standard handguard that you can't mount anything to), a winter trigger guard, front flip up sight (instead of stationary), a tactical muzzle break, two-stage trigger (very nice trigger), ergonomic grip (as opposed to the standard hogue), and a chrome lined barrel. It has two magazines through it and is in perfect condition (no blemishes, scratches, scuffs). I also have a bunch of accessories: extra magazines, ammo, Lucid HD7 red dot sight with 3x magnifier, soft and hard carry cases. The Lucid is an awesome red dot.  I have it installed on another AR I have, but have never shot the AR with the sight mounted to the gun.

2. Kimber 1911: It has new Trijicon night sights. It's in perfect condition. I have everthing it came with originally and a bunch of extra aftermarket and factory magazines (after markets are actually known to be more reliable than the Kimber mags).

3. Glock 21sf: .45 caliber Glock with the short frame (""SF""). The SF style has a more manageable slimmer grip. Feels a lot less like a brick! It has new Meprolight night sights. I have over 10 magazines for it. Excellent condition with everything it came with originally. I have other Glocks as well, but not sure I can part with them.

4. Sig Sauer P238 Gambler: This is a limited edition by Sig. It's similar to the Rosewood edition but has the word ""The Gambler"" etched in gold on the side of the slide and a ""dead man's"" poker hand on the top. It is no longer being manufactured by Sig, so it has collector value in addition to being one of the best pocket pistols available. It has not been fired and is new in the box it came in with one magazine and a paddle holster.  It has the new style snag free night sights.  I also have a Crossbreed Minituck for it as well (best IWB holster you can buy in my opinion).  The holster is made to fit the gun with a Crimson Trace laser attached to the trigger of the gun.  I have the laser as well.

5. Sig Sauer P220 Carry Equinox: never fired, a few extra magazines. Has TruGlo TFO night sights."

Bull Barrel Information:
The primary reason for bull barrels is accuracy. The larger diameter results in more stiffness and repeatability shot to shot.

The next advantage is recoil management. With this larger barrel diameter comes additional weight. Usually this is a liability, but since bull barreled ARs are usually shot from a bipod or sandbags the additional weight of the barrel helps keep the rifle in position. A 12-14 pound AR in .223 is a joy to shoot. Often bullet impact can be observed because recoil is so minimal.

The final advantage in my opinion is velocity. Since weight conservation is already out the window, many bull barrel makers take advantage of this and make the barrel longer. A 24"" or even the 26"" WOA barrel offer additional velocity that makes these tack drivers flat shooters as well.

The scope is an off brand and came with the rifle as an upgrade and has worked flawlessly for the time I've had it, and has a lifetime warranty.  For more info please email me with your phone number.  Asking $3000, I can take PayPal, you pay the fees.  Thanks!"

Every stroke turns out a precisely crimped shell, fully resized to factory dimensions.

The 366 Auto features full-length resizing, automatic primer feed, swing-out wad guide, three-stage Taper-Loc crimping, automatic advance to the next station, automatic ejection and one primer tube filler. Additional die sets are available in 12, 20, and 28 gauge.

It has been neglected over the past ever cause ive been in military training but still functions flawlessly with a super smooth action. It does have some surface rust but no pitting. I read up on it and planned to remove it myself but didn't want to risk messing the it up and having a worthless gun, so i figured i could sell it and let the new owner who hopefully has more gunsmithing know how then me give her some TLC. Minus the surface rust the gun is in great shape, the stock is flawless with no dents or dings.

SOLD 1. Smith and Wesson M&P 15-22. This gun has 4 magazines, MagPul furniture, hand grip, etc.. There is a standard carry handle on it, a Red dot scope, and rail covers all added to it. Has about 300 rounds through it. Very dependable, and fun to shoot it the .22 caliber. Laser mounted is available for an extra 100, and the tactical flashlight with quick release is available for an additional 50. I paid more for it, but it was bought for this rifle. $500

2. Excellent Mosin Nagant. Has the bayonet, original sling, and is in great shape. I just feel guilty shooting this one, as it is a great collector rifle. One minor nick by where the bayonet tip meets the stock. I have seen this in many, and see it as very common. Bore is great, and headspacing is correct. Bolt functions very well. I think I have some ammo I could include. Shoots the 7.62x54 round and is a cheap, fun gun... $250

SOLD  3. Glock 26. This Glock (9mm) has a low round count, and is in great shape. Has the upgraded stainless steel pins, a 12# trigger spring, with a trigger job, so comes out to about 8# pull. Consistent shooter. Until recently, was my EDC for CCW. Has a total of 11 magazines with it. All have the Peirce +2 pinky extensions. Have the original box, papers, etc, and spring if you do not like the heavier pull. $700

SOLD  4. Glock 36. This .45 is the slim Glock, Gen 3. It shoots flawlessly. I bought it new, and have put 250 rounds through it. Has 6 magazines total, some with pinky extensions, adding a +1 round to it. Never had a FTF/FTE on this. Very accurate. Great for CCW. $600

5. Winchester model 94, in .32 Winchester special. Search AL, and you will see it in another ad. $1200

Lots of people own them and seem to really like them. Long story short I am not a fan of these guns. I am going to sell it and use the money to build another AR which I prefer. I took it to the range today put 40 or so flawless rounds through it and just was not impressed and moved on to shooting my AR. Below is everything include

*Cugir Romanian AK47 Wasr 10 with an Ultimak gas black rail installed. This is the choice forgrip rail according to the ak guys on the forums. Mounted on the rail is a Primary Arms Red dot. The mount screw head is pretty rounded out. Easy $.20 cent fix from the hardware store for a new one. I also installedTapco ak74 style muzzle brake which reduces the recoil and gives it an nice look as opposed to the slant one that came stock. Gun with come with one steel mag still in bag. Asking $700 for the gun w/ rail + red dot.

*Bulldog Tactical Case. Has 4 mag holders on the side. Nice little bag $40
*Tula steel case 1000 round case (960 now) (Sale Pending)
*13 Tapco mags (Sale Pending)

The price of these guns are only going to increase as the election nears and I am in no rush to sell this so I am not going to take a hit. I will have pictures of everything tomorrow evening. Its late I just got home from the gym and I am about to go to sleep.

Email me or text at REDACTED. Calls I can do after 6 but I go to the gym after work so I might not answer, please leave a voicemail. If you do not have a FOID card I can not sell to you.

Selling an AK I built up as a project about a year ago - was a lot of fun but after realizing I have only fired 72 rounds through it in one outing to the range in over a year, decided I needed to liquidate it and the rest of my AK setup to fund more components for multigun, my real passion these days.  This is a solid fighting rifle, with the best side-folding mechanism (ACE) and best quad rail handguard / gas tube (Ultimak) on the market.

Here is a list of what it comes with:

WASR 10/63 7.62x39mm rifle, Ultimak M1-B gas tube rail, Ultimak ACR2-SL extended tri-rail handguard, Tapco G2 trigger group, Krebs retainer plate, US Palm pistol grip, Magpul AFG, TangoDown rail covers x 2, AK-74-style brake, ACE modular receiver block, ACE side-folding stock mechanism, ACE pig-nose stock adapter, 6-position M4 stock & mil-spec buffer tube, Noveske single-point QD socket endplate, .30cal boresnake"

Manufactured by Fabrica de Armas in Oviedo Spain, they were the Major manufacturer of Mauser Rifles for the Spanish Military during the entire first half of the last century.
 They have a reputation for being strong, accurate and reliable shooters. The 7mm Mauser is an excellent all-around hunting cartridge capable of taking most North American Game Animals. As a result these excellent rifles have been converted into hunting arms.

I have two 16"" mid length AR15s and want to sell one to start funding another car project.

Its a Delton 16"" 1-7"" twist mid length chrome lined medium contour upper with a high pressure tested and magnetic particle inspected bolt and chrome lined carrier. These uppers come test fired from Delton since the bolts are high pressure tested and that is the only time this rifle has been fired. I cleaned the bolt and the rest of the upper when UPS brought it to me and lubed it up. Has A2 flash hider and hand guards and ""F"" marked front sight base with a carry handle. It will need sighted in as I have not fired it.

The lower is an RGuns lower that I bought stripped along with a lower parts kit. I assembled the lower with an A2 milspec fixed stock and did a little work on cleaning up the trigger machining marks so it isnt gritty. Trigger feels nice and breaks clean.

It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a tactical mall ninja AR15, but it is a nice basic chrome lined rifle that will teach you to shoot with iron sights instead of a cheap red dot scope.

The price is pretty firm but cash is king. AR15 stuff is still on backorder for a while and hard to get a hold of. I do not want trades unless you have liquid cooled volkswagen parts. Particularly a 4 cylinder 02A transmission and ABA motor stuff."
