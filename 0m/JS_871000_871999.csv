The bike has been babied, I am the second owner and has been covered since it's been in my possesion. I bought the bike a few months back from the original owner, thinking it would be nice to be back on a bike but with a family and work it pretty much just sits. The original older was an older man who went through a mid-life crisis I'm assuming when building the bike. He stated the bike shop he bought it at told him by putting on an extended swingarm (not blocks) and lowering the bike (adjustable lowering links in rear) it would make it more stable, thus the stretched stance. It's got the rear fender delete with LED integrated turn signals and tail light. I have all the original equipment/parts that came stock on the bike. I also have new levers and HID's which have yet to be put on. The bike was the special edition Silver w/ Red flames but was sandblasted and sprayed and cleared in matte black to give it the old hot rod / bobber feel. As you can see in the pics the bike is not perfect but isn't far from it. I've attached the NADA guide suggested sale price for this model bike with higher miles than mine. Current mileage is 3,3xx. Asking $6500 OBO , somewhat flexible on price but will not go too lowdue to the fact I've almost got my asking price into it. Possibly open to partial trade +cash. Atvs, 4wheelers, mud truck, rifles, shotguns, handguns, bobber, hardtail, etc. Feel free to contact me with any questions, (ninefour one)321-9316 text prefered.

Brand new, never fired. Hammer forged, Chrome lined barrel and gas system, folding stock. Tapco G2 trigger (awesome BTW)

This is a genuine Hungarian FEG manufactured AMD65 and not some cheap Century build. This is the real deal. If you like rapid fire from the shoulder (ahem cough, cough) you will love this little rifle. These AMDs are absolute flame throwers and accurate as hell for their extremely short stature. This can be folded and placed into a VERY small bag such as a tennis racket bag or small backpack. 
If you are unfamiliar with these welcome to my family...

This is a very, very, VERY ban friendly weapon. What I mean by that is that when there is any type of ban, this will have a giant bullseye on it. It has all the features that bed-wetting libtards hate. Piss them off.

I have sold 2 of these so far and never had one complaint. I love these little AKs. FEG makes a very high quality (borderline indestructible) build that will eat any kind of ammo you throw at it all day long with no malfunctions. This is not your grandaddys AK."

Looking for a legal sale, if you are out of state or need the gun shipped it will have to go from my local FFL to your local FFL.  As you know this shot gun will work as both a semi auto and a pump action gun.  In semi auto there is just about no recoil at all.  This is truly a fun gun to shoot.  This gun has the updated safety and includes an owners manual.  Beware of any SPAS 12 that does not have the safety upgrade installed because it can fire with out pulling the trigger when the gun is put into battery.  I bought the gun about 4 years ago to get the older boy interested in shooting clays at the club.  It worked well and he now uses an Ithaca.  The Spas has not been used for over a year. $1600 or best offer.  Not really interested in trades but would consider partial trades for New York made Ithaca guns of all types or perhaps a shooter grade 1911A1  of war time mfg or shooter grade pre 1970 Colt commercial in 45 ACP or 38 Super.

It is an awesome gun and shoots like a dream.  Unfortunately, it was modified by the previous owner for competition purposes. As you can see in the pictures the compensator was cut to the barrel length. It was also modified where the grip meets the trigger guard. None of the modifications affect the function in any way. It also has a few very minor handling marks. Let me know if you want any specific pictures or have any questions.  To purchase this pistol you MUST have a pistol purchase permit or a concealed carry permit.  Thanks for looking!"

For those unclear on fair offer, don't agree on a price over e-mail then when we meet offer less because this post said ""but will consider all fair offers.""  First, the lowball in person wasn't fair (you knew this was used and had no box when we set up the meeting) and secondly, you never mentioned anything other than asking price via e-mail...instead you led off with ""Very nice! Would love to have it"" and the condition was exactly as described.  Don't waste my time trying to haggle the last $20 out of me then welch on the deal.  You should have put in an e-mail or text that you only wanted to pay $350.  If you want a safe queen with original box I recommend you go to the gun store and buy one.  Cripes, I didn't realize democrats even checked out these pages.

Changing to a stainless steel frame from the lighter alloy frame normally used is meant to reduce felt recoil. The ST models are typically bare stainless (all ""silver""), though SIG Sauer has produced Nitron finished (all ""black"") ST versions for police department trial and evaluation (T&E) guns.

Item Description

A New Perspective on the Automatic Rifle: The B.E.A.R.™ combines design innovation and precision manufacturing built upon the tried and true M4/M16 rifle platform. The Adcor Defense B.E.A.R.™ springs from the M4/M16 rifle platform but offers a completely new twist. Available in many configurations, it offers the operator many significant improvements:

A Revolutionary Gas Piston System (Patent # REDACTED8)

Free-floating barrel and increased accuracy: A gas-driven piston incorporated into the upper half of the forward rail system never touches the barrel.
No carrier tilt: The operating rod is connected to the bolt carrier by hex head bolts reinforced with industrial grade Loctite® 262™ high strength threadlocker. They are then drilled and pinned to prevent loosening under adverse conditions. The operating rod then rides through a machined boss in the receiver rail system interface keeping the bolt carrier in a linear plane as it operates.

No fouling of chamber and action: Hot gases and carbon particulates are prevented from entering the receiver. Because heat reaching the upper receiver is diminished, lubricant lasts longer and maintenance is simplified.

Easily detached lower rail system: No special tools needed for quick cleaning and easy maintenance.

Wear on critical parts is minimized: The operator can easily adjust the piston’s cyclical rate for a controlled rate of fire.

No need for piston rings: Extremely close machine tolerances of the piston eliminate the need.

Exclusive Port Dust Wiper with Cover

Prevents entry of dust, sand or debris: The spring-loaded dust shield mounted on the bolt carrier allows the bolt carrier’s return to ready position; the port dust wiper moves into the ejection port opening flush with the inside geometry of the upper receiver.

Withstands temperature extremes: because of the highly durable, self-lubricating polymer shield.

Ambidextrous Forward Placed Charging Handle: Simplicity is Beautiful.

Simple design: allows the operator to keep his or her strong hand on the firearm and use the other hand to clear the rifle.

Ambidextrous handle: detaches easily without special tools and returns to locked position once used. It folds forward, recessed, and easily swings back out in a single motion.

Non-reciprocating handle: only engages when the operator charges or clears.

Rail System ( 7075-T6 )

Innovative, key locked, highly rigid rail system mounts seamlessly to the upper receiver: Design ensures proper alignment of the rail with a redesigned boss, spline and groove system.

Upper and lower rail guards separate with the push of a button: No special tools necessary.

Fully compatible: with optical, image intensification or thermal sights; laser targeting systems; bipods; tactical lights and Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES).

A New Perspective on the Automatic Rifle: The B.E.A.R.™ combines design innovation and precision manufacturing built upon the tried and true M4/M16 rifle platform. The Adcor Defense B.E.A.R.™ springs from the M4/M16 rifle platform but offers a completely new twist. Available in many configurations, it offers the operator many significant improvements:

A Revolutionary Gas Piston System (Patent # REDACTED8)

Free-floating barrel and increased accuracy: A gas-driven piston incorporated into the upper half of the forward rail system never touches the barrel.
No carrier tilt: The operating rod is connected to the bolt carrier by hex head bolts reinforced with industrial grade Loctite® 262™ high strength threadlocker. They are then drilled and pinned to prevent loosening under adverse conditions. The operating rod then rides through a machined boss in the receiver rail system interface keeping the bolt carrier in a linear plane as it operates.

No fouling of chamber and action: Hot gases and carbon particulates are prevented from entering the receiver. Because heat reaching the upper receiver is diminished, lubricant lasts longer and maintenance is simplified.

Easily detached lower rail system: No special tools needed for quick cleaning and easy maintenance.

Wear on critical parts is minimized: The operator can easily adjust the piston’s cyclical rate for a controlled rate of fire.

No need for piston rings: Extremely close machine tolerances of the piston eliminate the need.

Exclusive Port Dust Wiper with Cover

Prevents entry of dust, sand or debris: The spring-loaded dust shield mounted on the bolt carrier allows the bolt carrier’s return to ready position; the port dust wiper moves into the ejection port opening flush with the inside geometry of the upper receiver.

Withstands temperature extremes: because of the highly durable, self-lubricating polymer shield.

Ambidextrous Forward Placed Charging Handle: Simplicity is Beautiful.

Simple design: allows the operator to keep his or her strong hand on the firearm and use the other hand to clear the rifle.

Ambidextrous handle: detaches easily without special tools and returns to locked position once used. It folds forward, recessed, and easily swings back out in a single motion.

Non-reciprocating handle: only engages when the operator charges or clears.

Rail System ( 7075-T6 )

Innovative, key locked, highly rigid rail system mounts seamlessly to the upper receiver: Design ensures proper alignment of the rail with a redesigned boss, spline and groove system.

Upper and lower rail guards separate with the push of a button: No special tools necessary.

I picked them up off my personal property so I can attest to the once fired part, the used .308 is crushed to preclude reloading, very little ACP brass and it I would not advise reloading it. Brass right now has been around $2 a pound, I would rather this get used than just scrap it, so I am asking a reasonable price for someone looking to load these calibers and recycle the rest for scrap price.

These have 6 screw caps and are 3/4"" from the base of the ring to the bottom of the scope tube. I bought these for a new Savage Precision Carbine but were too tall for my purpose. These were mounted to the picatinny rail but never tightened and the scope was placed in them but the caps were never installed. I still have the boxed they came in from Midway.

One look and you know Xtreme Tactical Rings are all about point-of-aim security and durability. The super-strong yet surprisingly lightweight, six-screw aluminum rings anchor scopes in place on any Picatinny rail or Weaver-style base to deliver unfailing return-to-zero. Available in 1"" and 30mm sizes, a choice of four ring heights accommodates the installation of any sight from red-dots to large objective target scopes. The 1"" height is perfect for all scopes on AR15/M16 flattop receivers, providing proper cheek weld. Designed and built for the rigors of tactical shooting and massive recoil, Xtreme Tactical Rings are not out of place on varmint rifles or big game rifles that may be exposed to the abuses of hard hunting and magnum recoils."

I have put 20 rounds of .223 through this gun just to to insure functionality.  Comes with detachable carry handle style rear sight with flipable large and small aperature with windage and elevation adjustment and detachable adjustable front sight.  I have also added a single point sling attachment point and sling.  Comes with 2 steel 20 rd. mags.  This gun is manufactured to safely fire 5.56 NATO ammo.  Great Gun.

One thing I've noticed about these DPMS rifles is a nicely manufactured bolt carrier group that should yield nice reliability and is better than some other brands.  Excellent staking on the gas key bolts so it will remain secure for a long time.  Beefy bolt carrier rear end for nice balance, smoother function, and less wear over some other manufacturers.  Fully shrouded firing pin for much longer firing pin life.  These are just my observations as compared to some ARs produced by other manufacturers.
