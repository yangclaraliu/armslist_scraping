I know its not really what you'd find on Armslist; however, if I cant sell it, I'd rather trade it to someone who can use it in return for firearms which have always proven to be a good investment.  I also have considerable experience with Cisco equipment configuration, as well as routing and switching, and edge security, ASA/PIX/VPN so if you have a small business I'd be willing to trade time or work at a flat rate setting up for you.

I am willing to take substantially less than cost, prices are listed for refrence.  This stuff has been sitting for over 6 months, so it really needs to go.

HP/Compaq NX9010 laptops.  My business devices.  I used these for plugging into network equipment and programming them.  Old and used, but they still work very well.  Asking only $50 each.

Several old 17"" flatscreen monitors, used.  asking $30 each

box of keyboards and mice

Approximately 150 cell phones.  Most work and include batteries.  All take Cingular or AT&T SIM cards, would be a great chance to resell for parts or short term use... theres always an ad on craigslist of someone looking for AT&T phones cheap because someone dropped theirs in a toilet.  Most are flip-style, also includes a blackberry 9000, razors, treo's, and a bunch more.  Money making op here.  No chargers.

Ever since the business went under, I'm pretty well soured on technology, just would like this stuff gone and something usefull in its place.  Again, I know this isn't the usual Armslist stuff, so thanks for being patient.

I bought this revolver NEW. I thought my wife could use an extra firearm to keep in her vehicle, but she didn't feel proper having a revolver within the reach of our kids. It just makes sense.

Anyways...as previously stated it's new, which means it's never been carried and is unfired. I cannot take it back from where I bought it, so it's up for grabs on the FGT.

It's all blued steel, holds 5 rounds of .38 special, and has a 3"" barrel.

I'm located in Tampa (33615), and will not travel too far from this region. The price is $300. I'm not interested in LCD TVs, XBOXs, Playstations, Tools, or any other sort of item. Cash only please. I've already mentioned it's NEW...not like new, not almost new, not fired a couple times, but NEW IN THE BOX. 

If seriously interested, kindly call OR text (813)Four Two Zero-7917. I'll respond to email too, but not as quickly. Also, you must be willing to sign a Bill of Sale and present a vailid FL drivers license. 

NOTE: The ONLY thing I'm intersted in trading for is a 12 gauge shotgun. Either a Remington 870 or Mossberg 500. 20"" barrel or less. No hunting shotguns please. I would expect it to be an even trade, my revolver for you're shotgun.

The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

The grips were also sanded down by the previous owner. Also just for full disclosure, last time I took it to the range it had a few failures to eject. About 10 out of 100 and something odd rounds I shot. I was using some cheap steel cased stuff so that might have been the problem but I'd consider it more of a range gun than anything.

Same caliber and has the folding bayonet on the end. The finish on the stock looks like it went through some hard times and the shellac has hazed over to a whitish color. The metal however is in good shape and has been cleaned of cosmoline and kept oiled. Matching numbers for the most part and the only other thing I can think of is that the floor plate latch is a little loose compared to my M44. Bore has good rifling and I've scrubbed the chamber free of cosmoline so the action is smooth and it's ready to shoot.

This pistol has had about 200 rounds through it and is in fantastic shape.  I have not had a single malfunction. It comes with the box and everything that came with it new.  The magazines hold 12 rounds and 2 magazines are included.  I love this pistol but it is not the firearm I carry, and I just cant afford to shoot .45 recreationally.  This is the model that has the decocker and double strike capability.

 All 100% German made gun,100% reliable you can expect from Sig Sauer (sorry,i have to correct some,the Sigs been made after 2003 at Exeter N.H all suck,i have P239 and P229,all in 9 mm,both came back to factory for repair,not once-TWICE,i got rid both and lost much money) .Believe me or not,because this gun is discontinued,the price will be up in future,because this is a 100% German made,who have them,the serious collectors won't sell them ever,specially with two-tone model like this one,i bet you won't find it anywhere. Now, you just found one for sale(because i'm not a serious collector.Ha,,Ha.LOL)

I rate the finish on the gun about 95% like new. Remember,this gun was make in 1999(13 years ago). Sitting around all time,didn't shoot much. 

Just put the Truglo night sight on recently ,which fiber optic and tritium inserted,this combination give you the same sight picture both daylight and night. This sight costs me $129(damn,sometimes i thought it made by gold,to expensive) I love this sight a lot,i have the original sights which came with the gun,too. Box,manual,2 recoil springs, 5 brand new grip washers (Sig's grips compatible) and 3 mags(Sig's mag isn't cheap,$45/each)

Just want to make it clear,nothing's wrong with this gun to force me selling it. All i want is pocket carry and the North American Arms NAA Guardian .32ACP is my "" Guardian "" right now. It will serve me as long as i'm still alive, until...i die or it's...stolen. Lol :-)

I posted the gun for sale once and i got a serious buyer, who wants to trade mine for his rare Ruger Mini14 stainless made a long time ago ( 1987 or ???) with $300 cash. He is one of nicest buyers who i've been contacted with, but...then, i decided not to trade because i love this gun so much, i can't live without it. And took the post off Armslist. Now, it's back. 

This is what i believe the best compact .45ACP ever made base on factors:  all metal made, fires .45ACP-firepower proven with little recoil (easy get back to target quickly after the 1st shot), compact grip for conceal carry but still feel comfortable in hand, accuracy, safe, reliability, durability, brand name, second strike option(DA/SA) if the primer is bad, easy to take down without tools to clean, ...I'm confident 100% to trust my life on this particular handgun. Don't believe me, bring the ammo, go to the range with me, i'll let you shoot it by all the positions you want. If the gun's malfunctioned by any kind, i'll give you $100.00 plus i'll pay you back the ammo. If it's eat anything and so accurate as tack-driver, no malfunctions occur, you lose your ammo and just give me $50.00 for my time.Ha...Ha Wanna gamble, guys...?????

(From Remington)
 The Model 700 SPS Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700 action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence.
 Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity caliber. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation. And sharp predator eyes won’t spot the tough, non-reflective matte blued finish on the barrel and receiver. Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700 SPS Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.

""The China Camp Cowboy Action Gun in our patented Silver Steel Competition Finish"" 
""Mr. Dennis Ming, 5 time world champion shootist, asked U. S. Fire-Arms, under the famous blue dome in Hartford, Conn., to help him make the gun he has searched for all these years.  Dennis's many titles in cowboy action shooting makes him an authority."" 
As for the actual gun, USFA noted; 
""Square notch rear sight, action job with crisp trigger.  Gun certified for point of impact.  The China Camp is a special gun for the advanced shooter, combining the historic details of yesterday with the modern honed precision of today."" 
The China Camp models used the bull's eye ejector on the cross pin frame. Serial numbers were preceded with the letters ""CC."" 4&3/4"", 5&1/2"" and 7&1/2"" barrel lengths were standard, other lengths optional. .45 was the standard caliber, .41 Colt, .44, .38 S&W Special and .32 WCF were offered as optional. Hard rubber grips were standard. 

This revolver has NOT been fired outside of the factory. It has neither box nor documents. Serial number is CC36X. If I have to ship it to your FFL, it'll cost $35.00."

The Axiom 61 is a Gen 2. I've used it a few times, but I find that I just end up leaving it in it's case most of the time, which is a waste.  I'm not going to repeat what's already been written, so if you want to know what this keyboard does and it's specs, please see the following link:

http://www.guitarcenter.com/M-Audio-Axiom-61-2nd-Gen-61-Key-USB-MIDI-Keyboard-Controller-105947832-i1532545.gc

It comes in a form-fitting Gator case, which is worth about $70. It isn't like the current Gator cases which have wheels, it just has the handles for carrying. Also includes the USB cable, and driver and documentation CD.

This Is the original Desert Eagle in .357 before the 50AE  version ever existed. Yes its not nearly as powerful as the 44 or 50, but have you priced a box of 50 compared to 357? what im trying to say is that this is much more pleasurable and cheaper to shoot.....and no it doesn't shoot 38 special if that's what you were thinking. This thing is in almost 100 percent condition, and functions flawlessly....its been a safe queen. I just put 20rds down the tube last weak to make sure its all good....it is. And i cleaned it, I'll show you how to take it down if your interested. 

Anyway it will come with two 9rd magazines, that's all.....I don't have the box. Shoulda held on to that...oh well. Hindsight is 20/20. I'm Mainly looking for high-end 1911's, and custom or collectable firearms. I have a weakness for S&W performance shop firearms. 45acp is king in my book.

I'm only interested in selling it if you want to pay the Blue book price.....even then i'm much more interested in a trade. I'll trade down in price ( for the right gun) if you make up the difference.

It has been custom built by Bowie Tactical Concepts and Apex Tactical Specialties. I purchased the pistol and had it built for open class steel plate competition but got involved with other projects and this has just been sitting in the safe for over a year. The pistol has an honest  300rds through it and functions flawlessly. I want to make clear that this has not been used for completion yet and only practiced with and broke in. This pistol has the best trigger I have ever felt on a polymer frame pistol. To be honest I have some custom built 1911s that don't even have triggers like this. It features an Apex Tactical Specialties forward set sear & aluminum trigger kit set at 3lbs, 360 degree grip stippling, and milled slide for a Trijicon MS03 red dot sight. Stock Barrel has been hand lapped to reduce leading when shooting lead reloads and is very accurate. The Trijicon Red dot is fully adjustable and also includes removable/stackable JP Enterprise’s elevation adjustment shims for custom loads. The slide Milling has been cut for this Trijicon sight but will also fit JP enterprises JPoint and Leopold Delta point sights. The Trijicon Sight also has a built in rear backup sight that still works with the front Novak Fiber Optic sight. This is a cutting edge pistol that has been quality built and needs nothing other than for you to sight it in for your custom reloads or favorite factory ammo. This pistol has very fast sight acquisition and is geared toward competition but can be used for a plinking or home protection as well (heavier trigger spring that is included is recommended for home protection).  It Includes 4 Factory 17rd magazines, case, stock takeoff parts and original paperwork as well.  The only wear this pistol has on it whatsoever is the Trijicon logo on left side of sight wears when the protective dust cover gets put on and taken off. Below is a breakdown of the work performed along with prices I paid.

S&W  M&P 9Pro 17+1rd, SKU: 178010 = $560
Trijicon MS03 8.0 MOA RedDot (lifetime warranty) = $340
360 Degree grip Stippling (Bowie Tactical Concepts) = $100

Forward Set Sear and Trigger group (Apex Tactical Specialties) = $155
Barrel lapping (local gunsmith) =$30
2 Extra 17rds mags @ $28 each = $56

My great uncle used this rifle to shoot bears when he was working oil fields in Alaska. He apparently modified it, removing the bayonet and sling. He passed it on to my dad who recently passed away and so I inherited this as well as his other guns. My dad kept it cleaned and in good shape. I've never fired it but my dad did a couple of times.

The production of the earliest model SR-25's started in 1989. The SR-25 was first conceptualized with its primary function being a sniper rifle. It delivers remarkable shooting accuracy with .5 MOA being attainable in a multiple targer enviroment. The MK11 MOD0 and the M110 have embodied this experience and helped drive our company's renowned pursuit of perfection ultimately leading to the Enhanced Match Series of SR-25's.

The new Enhanced Match (E.M.) Rifle combines some of the best characteristics from the combat proven MK11 MOD0 and the M110 military rifles. The E.M. Rifle's Free-Floating barral is a clone of the legendary MK11 MOD0's, but its Upper Receiver Extending (URX) forend with integral folding front sight was developed for the Army's XM-110 Rifle.

As I understand these were imported during part of the 70's and early 80's.  Gun has some wear, and I expect someone used it as a field gun for birds, as it would be ideal for such.  No rust or damage, just some honest field wear from use here and there.  Fairly light gun with a great feel, locks up very tight and this one has the ejector and also the bolt-into-barrel lockup feature that only seems to be on about half of the model 63B's or fewer.  Quick take down shotgun... push button and remove fore grip, release barrels and remove, and you're broken down.  Didn't see another 26 inch barrel for sale like this right now.

Gun has some non-original items, I noted a different fore-grip screw and the previous owner said the butt stock was replaced (but with some nice wood with excellent grain and markings, fitment is excellent and I didn't realize it had been replaced until I had been informed).  Most of these I've seen have ugly replaced butt stocks (the stocks are apparently notorious for cracking on these) and they still bring $300 looking like junk.  This one looks excellent and matches up well with the fore grip.  Case color receiver with blued barrels and trigger assembly.  Really pretty gun that gets a lot of attention both in the cabinet and any time I take it out.  3 inch chamber, full length ribbed barrel (rare, most are only ribbed the first 4 inches or so, the full length looks much better).  Gun shows some wear here and there, but nothing bad.  Cash $325"
