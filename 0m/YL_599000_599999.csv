6,http://www.armslist.com/posts/599006,For Sale:  LGB Trains & Track,"Northwest, Tucson, Arizona",$ 800,"Listed On: Sunday, October 7, 2012",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"PRICE REDUCTION TODAY on this wonderful collection of used and unused Large Scale Trains ready for your Garden Layout or back porch or wherever you can get away with it.  It’s not too early to be planning and testing your Easter Layout.  Carrying the little eggs and candy and chocolate round and round.  Cool.

First there is an LGB Short Island Railroad train set.  Includes the engine, two cars, 12 pieces of curved track, and the transformer.  It’s been run, but not really a whole lot.

Three Playmobil cars new and unused.  Two 4104 gondolas and one 4105 gondola with a load of pipes.

Two Bachman Big Hauler #44 South Pacific Coast Passenger Cars.  Also new and unused.  Sort of.  One car was on the track for a wee bit, but I don’t think it was ever actually placed into service.  There is but one box, and it is not at all pristine.  Far from it.

Finally, there is the track.  
•	Of course there is the original circle with 12 pieces of track.  
•	Ten Aristo-Craft 36” straight track.  Mostly new and unused, but not well cared for.  So it’s dusty and dirty.  But in otherwise great condition.  
•	Fourteen Aristo-Craft curved track new and unused and pristine.
•	Sixteen Aristo-Craft 12” straight track new and unused and pristine.
•	Fourteen Aristo-Craft 12” one-half curved track new and unused and pristine.
•	Two Aristo-Craft left turnouts new and unused and pristine.
•	Two Aristo-Craft right turnouts new and unused and pristine.

There’s a lot of trains here.  Perhaps too much for any one person to absorb.  I suppose the Bachman and/or the Playmobil cars could be sold first, together or separately.  Then the LGB Short Island train set.  Engine, cars, track, transformer.  And then finally the track and turnouts.

I arrived at the price of $800 by staring into the clouds until the moon rose, and then looking into the puddle left by the rain and asking:

“Puddle Puddle on the walk, 
Time for you to hear me talk,
what’s the price 
and tell me twice.”  

At which point my wife said the neighbors thought I was bereft of my senses and had locked their children and pets indoors.

So be it.  If you think, as do I, that this collection of Large Scale Trains is worth more, please feel free to offer more.  It will not embarrass me in the least.  In fact, it will warm my heart to know there are honest buyers left in the world.  Or at least in Arizona.

Purchase with great confidence.  You absolutely will not be disappointed.  You may even be thrilled with your purchase.

Cash is preferred, but interesting trades will be considered.  Leupold, EoTech, or Colt or Smith & Wesson or Sig or…..  Perhaps a Short barrel .357 magnum.  Please no leather, whips, chains, or teenage children.  Already have enough of those."

Plus, it includes 170 rounds of quality ammunition, from plinkers to lifesavers.  Just imagine the striking power of a 250 grain hollow point law enforcement load.  Likely to be a one shot stop.

This double action pistol is a horse.  It is not for the faint of heart, and it is not a particularly good concealed carry pistol unless you are taller and bigger than am I.  If you did use it for concealed carry you would certainly have the firepower for just about any conceivable concealed carry situation.  And of course the Smith & Wesson 629 is well known for its absolute reliability.

Some will say that the Smith & Wesson 629 is a work of art, beautiful in stainless steel.  You can certainly feel the quality when you place it in your hand.  The balance is good and it points well; it just feels right.

This nice, clean, very low-mileage revolver includes the original blue paper box, and I believe all the paperwork.  It includes 170 boxed rounds, and any loose 44 magnum ammunition that I may have.

Now to the price.  I’m going to ask $795 for the package, because that’s what I believe it to be worth.  This is a Smith & Wesson 629 44 magnum with 170 rounds.  Add up the value and you will agree that the price is right.

Purchase with great confidence.  You absolutely will not be disappointed.  You may even be thrilled with your purchase.

It has target turrets, an adjustable 40mm objective, and a one inch steel tube.  It’s a great scope for bench rest shooting.  Long range bench rest shooting.

This scope is in very very good condition.  It has obviously been mounted, and so there are very slight ring marks.  The finish is nice and dark and uniform.  Bright, crystal clear optics.  It’s amazingly bright and clear for a 25 power scope.  The reticle is a single cross-hair.

The scope has been used, but that has not affected its ability to perform.  Not much wear takes place looking through a glass.  I would be surprised if there were more than 100 rounds fired through the Sako, so it is unlikely there is any recoil damage to the scope either.

I’m selling it because I want less magnification.  The scope was mounted on a Sako Forester .308, which is not for sale.  There are no scope rings included because Sako uses a proprietary mounting system that does not work with Weaver.  I’ll use the rings on a different scope.

Now to the price.  I’m going to ask $400.  If you think, as do I, that this scope is worth more, please feel free to offer more.  It will not embarrass me in the least.  In fact, it will warm my heart to know there are honest buyers left in the world.  Or at least in Arizona.

I just re-acquired this back through a trade with a friend and I would like to piece it apart to keep what I need and sell what I don't, but it's almost easier to just sell it and buy what I want. Upper consists of the following parts:

-Rainer Arms flat top upper
-CMMG 14.7"" WASP barrel w/ A2 flash hider (not pinned)
-Low profile gas block
-11"" VTAC free float forearm
-JD Machine Charging handle
-Bushmaster NP3 light weight BCG

Selling for: $600 o.b.o.

The flash hider on this is not pinned nor welded at this time (previous f/h was drilled and removed to allow installation of lo-pro gas block, so please be aware of this and all NFA rules before purchasing as I assume no responsibility if you get in trouble. The threads had rocset or something on them from CMMG in addition to the pin weld, so threading a F/H the last few threads may require a wrench because there's a little resistance.

Next up is a very low round count BCM 16"" carbine upper. I bought this recently off of the EE and was going to keep it, but it's a good upper as is and if I keep it, I'm just going to tear it apart to do something else with it. Upper comes with MOE handguard and a Magpul illumination kit, but no BCG or CH.

This gun is one owner purchased brand new in 2001. Originally purchased for varmint hunting but it's only been to the range 2-3 times with no more than 100 total rounds shot through it since brand new. Meticulously cleaned and kept in a safe year around. This gun is in perfect condition. The scope was $500 at the time and still will bring between $400-$500 on ebay. The gun was originally purchased for $1600.

Weatherby's MK-V SVM (Super Varmint Master) reflects the company's all out effort to add a truly serious varmint (meaning highly accurate) rifle to its line. To that end the SVM is an all stainless steel affair with the option of a magazine fed repeater or a single shot version with no magazine cut in the receiver bottom. The 26-inch, button rifled, heavy contour, fluted barrel is cryo treated and hand lapped. The stock, which has unmistakable Weatherby styling in the Monte Carlo combed butt section, is made of fiberglass and kevlar with an aluminum bedding block. The flat bottomed forearm adds lateral stability when you're shooting from sandbags or similar rests."

It has magazine dimples and it has the ""military"" barrel, which are sought after in sporters.

Inron MY803 Folding EDC Pocket Knife w/Orange G10 Handle
""Poor  Man's  Hinderer""

As a knife enthusiast, you may be ""in the know"" about the high quality yet low cost Sanrenmu, Enlan, and Ganzo knives. 

These little known knife manufacturers are credited with making some very high quality, well designed yet affordable folder knives especially well suited for every day carry purposes. In fact if you have any contacts within the knife/cutlery trade you will find out that Ganzo, Sanrenmu and Enlan's other activities include manufacturing knives for numerous western brands such as Benchmande, Spyderco, Buck, and SOG. So believe me when I say you're getting a lot for your money with these guys.

Now there's a new name to add to this list of quality folders. Enter Inron Cutlery with there beautifully made model MY803, aka ""the poor man's Hinderer"" so called for its strikingly similar design to that of the Rick Hinderer XM18. Of course this is comparing apples to very expensive oranges but you still get a similar look and ergonomic feel for the price of an XM18 washer.

The MY803 is a good sized folder at 8.8"" in total length with a 3.85"" high hollow ground blade. The blade steel is a 9Cr13MoV which is similar to 440C steel (more so than the older 8Cr13Mov is). This is a framelock knife with ""flipper"" action as well as ambidextrous thumb studs. 

I would say the MY803 has an excellent fit and finish for the price. Good detent, very solid lock up without any blade play. It has a flat head pivot screw for easy adjustments and it's ergonomic, oversized handle (easily used with a gloved hand) is made from G10 and is available in 3 color options. 

This solid knife weighs in at 5.6oz using drilled steel liners for weight reduction. For a larger EDC knife, the very slim profile design carries surprisingly well in the pocket. It comes tip up and right hand carry only.

The laser is VERY bright, and works great for CQC applications or training. 

$170 FTF or $175 Shipped FIRM. I have one already, but could justify putting this on another rifle if I had to. The old models are going for around $230 from a reputable dealer if you can find them in stock."

We have filled over 12 spots in our upcoming North Carolina CCH / CCW Concealed Pistol Training class Sunday Oct 21, 2012.

The course is instructed by seasoned firearms instructor, Roger Pettit.
Roger is fully licensed and fully insured (Lloyd's of London) and we hold the class on an actual gun range. He has a great sense of humor and has great stories being he's an ex-marine, bounty hunter, and has worked with multiple military contractors. The cost of the class is $85 a person OR $150 ($75 each) if you bring along a friend. This price is ALL INCLUSIVE meaning this price includes course work, red book, certificate, drinks and pizza for lunch, and Roger even supplies guns and ammo if you choose not to bring your own!!! No tricks or gimmicks here! If you don't have experience, no worries! Roger will get you up to pace during the class. If you've done any research on CCH you know $85 is CHEAP and alternatives NEVER include this much. The classes are small (10-20) and Roger has years of experience teaching them in multiple states. If interested let me know and check out the website info: www.PCShooting.com.

The next class is December 9th. Location is 25 minutes outside Cary, NC down US-1 at LCWC.

This is a lever action rifle.  The takedown means you can separate it into 2 smaller pieces ... allowing you to put into a backpack for instance.  Also allows cleaning of the barrel to be much easier.   

Has a removable magazine.  I find that to be very nice.  holds 4 rounds. 

This shoots very well, even with just iron sights.  Very comfortable, though I do have to move my ear protection headset up a little when I hold the rifle butt to my cheek, when shooting.  To me, it seems like very little recoil. 

This is by far the nicest rifle I have... nice wood stock, the barrel is painted.  Considering how clumsy I am, I hate to even take it into the woods with me!   

The lever has a nice embossed Browning graphic with a brass color fill. 

Why would I sell this?  I don't want to, but I don't really need it.  I have 2 other 270 win rifles (Remington 700)... and they seem to me to be much better hunting rifles; synthetic stock, bolt action, unbreakable ... :)  .. 

I bought this at Specialty Sports in January.  I paid $900 and change. It has had maybe 150  rounds shot through it.  It is in excellent shape. 

Included is a soft carrying case and a hard plastic case. 

I also need to pay some bills.  I got behind while getting my Jeep engine rebuilt.

It has a 5.5"" barrel, and is in 45 colt caliber. Originally bought to carry hunting with me but just can't bring myself to do it because it is just too pretty!

I think I even have a couple of bianchi speed strips as well. I am more interested in trading it than selling but am open to reasonable offers. As far as what I want to trade for, I really dont have a set thing in mind, so I am pretty much open to any firearms. Kinda like pistols more than long guns but have been wanting a mini-14 or maybe a nice bolt action .223. As far as pistols go, I would kinda like a 4inch .357 with adjustable sights, DA/SA style 9mm,.40, possibly .357 sig. Maybe a 44 mag or 10mm. Maybe even a nice AR optic. I can add some cash for the right trade, and I have a CCW. I live in Whiteville, NC, but regularly travel up 74 to Charlotte and around to Salisbury area. And also travel through Fayetteville, Sanford, and Burlington area regularly. I will also be traveling through the Rocky Mount area and Greenville this Saturday. I could meet ftf anywhere along these routes. Thanks for looking!"
