PLR-16

The PLR-16 is a gas operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 mm NATO caliber. It is intended to be the ideal Silhouette shooting and hunting pistol. The rifling is 1 turn in 9 inches, right hand twist. The PLR-16 has a conventional, long-stroke gas-piston operation and utilizes the proven Johnson/Stoner breech locking system. The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

We took the old nasty stock, cleaned her up. Sanded it a bit and put a textured black coat of paint on it. The bore is like BRAND NEW... Unbelievable... You can throw a scope on this thing and sight it in at 300-400 yards and GO TO TOWN... I mean, the original iron sighs were set up at 400 meters! Super fun gun! We enjoyed working on it and restoring it. But it's time to go! I'm selling it with both rails and the flip up and adjustable bipod, and the original bayonet."

The long heavy duty Flash suppressor with grip gives you a place to grip with your off hand if wanted also. It is deeply threaded and very secure. It is sturdy and well made. With the adjustable sling you can push away from your body and it is like having a shoulder stock(Israeli sling method) to provide a steady sight picture.

Description
Product Details
How much do you need to carry? The multi-pocketed Elite Vest has a place for all that and more. The vest starts with a durable, breathable cotton outer shell, treated with DuPont™ Teflon® Fabric Protector for a durable, breathable finish that repels water and oil-based spills, and a cotton poplin lining. A two-way zipper secures the front; in situations that might require quick access to inside gear you can skip the zip and simply fasten the quick-release hook-and-loop front tab. The vented back lets air flow through, side tabs customize the fit, and the padded collar enhances comfort. Now, about those pockets: The outside front alone includes 14 pockets: two hand-warmer pockets for frequently accessed items; two discreet vertical-entry security pockets on chest; four hook-and-loop flap pockets; two deep zippered security pockets; two smaller zippered patch pockets; and two open patch pockets. And that's just the front outside. There are also two interior pockets in front plus two in back for radios, complete with elastic loops at the shoulders to keep wiring in place. The outside back features a large hook-and-loop flap pocket with two elastic-topped pockets on either side. Imported. Machine wash.


I purchase this vest with the intent of using for edc cover. I liked black beacause it is slimming :-).  Wore it once to a Tanner Show. Very comfortable and a great ""cargo"" vest that really works well. Trouble is that it just appears to ""tactical"" for civilian use.

Looks like a well loved, well used battlefield rifle.

Never refurbished, but the metal is in great shape. The front sight is the original flat bottom one piece from 39.

Non matching, as is standard for Finnish capture and reissue. Interestingly has a very early solid barrel band.

Bore is very good, trigger and chamber are the best I've seen in a m91/30.

Now if you are looking for a Mosin to use as a shooter, I have better bored shooters for less. This is really a collectable, as the SA marked captured rifles are hard to find.

As with all my mosins, I will include 20 rounds of ammo and one Russian stripper clip for easy loading.

Additional ammo, strippers, and accessories can be purchased with the rifle, just ask.

Does not have the original bayonet. I can provide replacements (new surplus) for $5 each with the rifle."

 and a modified into ak type (or atleast still working on it with welding,) original saiga trigger group that WILL work when trigger groups moved forward and another one i made that needs alot more work.
i have 2 saiga standard gas tubes for which of what i dont really need,
i have 1 unkown probley polish i think or similar gas tube with witch has 3 holes on both sides from its factory of origin common ported upper gas tube so that i could use standard upper ak handguards.

i also have a few hitch pins for holding the retainer pins in place, and i also have 2 retainer plates but one of them is in bad shape. 
im sure i missed some stuff

the gun was tooken for photo purposes seeing as how its completly stripped and tooken apart right now anyways but i could throw it all back together in 10 minutes. its appearence is subject to change depending on what i get. , meets 922r compliance unless i had all the foreign stuff on there at one time in which case i didnt wouldnt and cant since most all my stuff is usa made anyway., american made grip , screw and nut, magazine and buttstock/handguards.

now the gun is a 7.62x39 which i have roughly 300 rounds for, i DID have the bolt carrier polished but i practiced blueing before i did a 50yr old .22 of my grandpas(never blued a gun before) and i did it because everyone was telling me it was to iced out and polished to nice and reflective, and that was bad. now im thinking of going back but anywho it has a 20inch barrel and the magcatch has been properly filed down and all ak mags and drums will fit snug nice and tight with little to no wobble. took my time converting this rifle with a week to a months research because i didnot want it to end up a piece of junk or break something. the gun does not have the ""mag well dimples"" and since this was my first ak i didnt know what those Were. well now that i know how big of a deal it is to ak people i dont understand it as to why, this one has added support INSIDE the reciever(did some research on this) and it prevents any wobble anyways its merley for looks and stuff i guess. 
but i really am putting this stuff on here because id like to hang onto the gun and maybe swap it out for somedifferent type of ak or ak platform saiga similar until somebody offers me something different i have been wanting a saiga 12 i wont take less than 900$ because of all the money i have in this gun.i still have the recipts to show and prove i am original and rightful owner of this gun. i no longer have original box sadly, but i have a copy of the russian owners manual.

you can text me and send me pictures of your cash or trade offers to derek at 1REDACTED a basic standard saiga 12 like new in box with accesorys or without converted or not, to a ffl or not would be a good deal for me i suppose.
 (but you better not be somebody i dislike or somebody who should not or cannot legally own or posses guns i will not sale it at all to any such kind of criminal the world is a messed up place where stupied people do stupied things and help to take away our right to respectfully enjoy things like these.....)

but personally i think i need alittle extra also or id like to keep a few things like the sidefolder tapco stock. i have alot for and with this gun,

a yugo m70ab2 underfolder would be a solid trade for me also. anything relativly similar to an ak i will consider.





id sell this saiga for 700 by itself would  come with standard stock saiga front handguard and tapco side folding stock. also usa pistol grip and g2 trigger. this is a one of a kind heavy barrel long range hard hitting gun.

Max, a wonderful family dog and upland dog, but could easily be trained on waterfowl. He is obedient trained. Wonderful family companion, he actually grew up with our four year old boy. He has his AKC papers from superior blood lines, if that is important to you. Max is trained on the following commands: sit, stay, down, here, release, kennel, truck, force fetch, quarter a field, gun broke, some hand signals, bird, ball, downstairs...I'm sure there's more, he's very smart and eager to please. Max is a tall, muscular lab that weighs 110 lbs. This dog is absolutely eager to retrieve with well over 1000 bird retrieves and 1,000,000 (it seems) ball retrieves. This is a solid hunting and family dog that I don't want to see go but we are moving and he needs a family who will love him and hunt him as I do. A dog this caliber will sell for around $6500 and I paid more than $2750 for him, so you may be suspicious of the price...here's the deal. I had him neutered because he has a genetic disorder I felt needed to be stopped (buyer will be informed of all details of this disorder before purchased) so I figure this reduces the price by half. He also got an infection on the tip of his tail last hunting season and had to have his tail bobbed, so for aesthetic reasons I'll reduce the price by $500. I will not sell Max to anyone (I have a home for him, but they don't hunt) if there is a buyer who will make him a family dog, exercise him and hunt him, I'll let him go. This is a solid hunting dog that will not disappoint!"

729,http://www.armslist.com/posts/521729,"For Sale:  STAR BM, 9mm, 4 mags, box, $425.00 OBO","pittsburg, Southeast, KS, Kansas",$ 425,"Listed On: Monday, August 20, 2012",Handguns,Star Firearms                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I believe this Star model BM Pistol was manufactured in 1980s by Star, Bonifacio Echeverria S.A. of Eibar, Spain for the Spainish Civil Guard, their national police force.  It quickly caught the attention of Europe, the Middle East, and even the United States with their excellent quality pistols that went into production in 1934, and served law enforcement world wide for decades.  The Star BM Compact Variant went online in 1972, similar in size to the colt officer model.  Specs are all steel construction single action semi-auto pistol chambered in 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19, John Moses Browning’s influence is evident from the photos, a descendant of his Model of 1911. The Echeverria Brothers left off Browning’s somewhat complicated Grip Safety, so the grip frame backstrap is smooth finished blue steel. The main safety engages in a well defined slot on the left side of the slide, and the main safety functions in two positions, both with the hammer back on cocked-and-locked carry, and with the hammer down in resting position. The safety lever also engages into a disassembly position midways of the slide. This pistol is not equipped with a firing pin safety, hence its stiff but crisp 6 pound vicinity trigger pull with negligible felt creep. Barrel bushing is distinctive, Tokarev style, and it anchors both the barrel securely into place and also anchors the one piece hardened steel guide rod. The rod is constructed both to ensure exceptional accuracy, and for easy disassembly and reassembly due to it housing its spring integrally, another ancestral feature that Detonics picked up on a few years later. Magazine is blue steel Star Factory, and capacity is 8 + 1 rounds of 9mm Luger. Sights are blue steel low profile combat, notched dovetailed rear and stake on steel ramp front. Weight empty is 34.2 ounces, balanced at the magazine release area of the trigger guard. Slide is serrated rear sight external extractor and grooved top. Barrel is 3 5/8 inches. Trigger is .312 white sides with blued serrated face, and hammer is matching traditional serrated medium spur .312. Measurements are 6 7/8 inches from the muzzle to the rear of the frame strut; 5 inches from the top of the rear sight to the butt edge of the grip frame; .704 inch frame thickness and .838 inch slide thickness. Grip panels are factory issue black checkered composite, and custom grips are widely available and reasonably priced. This specimen of the Star BM 9 is well maintained.

I have 4 original Star magazines, which are getting hard to find and now retail for $40 each, triple K does have after market mags for about $30 each.

I got this as a gift, I put in on my rifle and took it out to the range.  I have a compact rifle so after about 3 mags I knew it was to big and would not work on my particular rifle.  So I brought it back home and put it in the box and now its for sale.  This is in brand new shape, pristine condition and ready to ship.  All booklets, and manuals are included.  
Aimpoint pro is the law enforcement edition of the CompM3.  Same exact specs with 2 MOA but it takes a battery you can find at an everyday store not the specialty ones you have to order online.  These are only sold to law enforcement (well they are supposed to be anyway) so if your in the market for a CompM3 and want to save a couple hundred bucks then this is for you.
I will ship for free to US states only.  I would really like to use paypal if at all possible or if we meet up Cash is fine as well."

You can also buy exchange kits for around 200 if you wanted a different caliber or frame size. Only 1 box of ammo fired between both of them. The subcompact has some light scuffs from carry and the full size looks new. Selling everything for 500 or trade for another gun of equal value but will not include ammo. Or ill sell the subcompact without the fullsize frame for 350 or the fullsize without the subcompact frame for 400.

The major issues:
-The A/C doesn't work. I was told it just needs a charge.
-Passenger window needs motor. It is removed at the moment, and the window is wedged up.

Semi-Auto-22. A living tribute to the genius of Browning.

Few autoloading rimfire rifles have endured the test of time and the marketplace like the Browning SA-22. It stands alone as one of the first autoloading rimfires, and one the most desirable rifles ever made. The SA-22 was one of the last of John M. Browning’s designs, and his genius shines through in every feature. The slim, stylish forged steel receiver and slender barrel takes down into two compact units without tools. The SA-22’s tasteful engraving and select walnut make it an object of lasting beauty and enjoyment.

AAArms began distributing the AP9 in the early 1990s and did so until 2001. The AP9 looks like a small submachinegun, but has no automatic fire function. This firearm is basically a large pistol that looks very much like the Intratec TEC-9. 

 The standard AP9 has a 5"" barrel; the AP9 target began with a 12"" barrel (AP-9/12), but this was later reduced to 11"" (AP-9/11 Target); they both have a separate fore end and a fluted barrel. These firearms were banned by most states after the passage of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and other pieces of legislation, even after more cosmetic changes designed to make them appear to be less threatening. After the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 a ten round magazine was introduced. Original magazine capacities included 5 round, 10 round, 20 round and 32 round capacities. 

 This firearm has a forward handle, a flash suppressor and recoil compensator as well as a barrel extension.

The AP9 is a pistol that was manufactured by AA Arms and distributed by Kimel Industries, Inc of Indian Trail, North Carolina, USA. AAArms began distributing the AP9 in the early 1990s and did so until 2001. The AP9 looks like a small submachinegun, but has no automatic fire function. This firearm is basically a large pistol that looks very much like the Intratec TEC-9. 

 The standard AP9 has a 5"" barrel; the AP9 target began with a 12"" barrel (AP-9/12), but this was later reduced to 11"" (AP-9/11 Target); they both have a separate fore end and a fluted barrel. These firearms were banned by most states after the passage of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and other pieces of legislation, even after more cosmetic changes designed to make them appear to be less threatening. After the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 a ten round magazine was introduced. Original magazine capacities included 5 round, 10 round, 20 round and 32 round capacities. 

 This firearm has a forward handle, a flash suppressor and recoil compensator as well as a barrel extension.

If you want a small powerful revolver that is built like a Sherman tank, this is it. Ruger has not cut any corners like the other manufacturers have done.

The SP101 features a recoil-reducing cushioned grip system making it comfortable to shoot with no exposed metal at the back strap for shooter comfort. It easily handles the powerful .357 Magnum and .327 Federal Magnum cartridges in a controllable, small-framed double-action revolver.

It has a patented triple locking cylinder mechanism that securely locks the cylinder into the frame at the front, rear, and bottom and has a solid stainless steel frame that has no weakening side plates. 

INCLUDES both a Bianchi® and Uncle Mike’s® holster, Master Lock® safety lock, ORIGINAL manual, 10 CCI® shotshells, 20 Starfire™ hollow point rounds, and 50 Winchester® hollow point rounds. Best buy on Armslist or anywhere else!

This pistol will still be shooting well in 99 years. Pass it on to your grandkids with confidence!
