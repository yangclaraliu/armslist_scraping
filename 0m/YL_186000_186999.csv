> About the build: 
> They are called builds not conversions, because real engineering and testing 
> goes into them.  Once a base action is identified a “test mule” is 
> constructed and tested with at least 500 P+ loads to insure the gun will last 
> and not have any catastrophic failure.  The gun is measured against the 
> factory specs (taken when new) and recorded. The gun must pass this test 
> before it can be considered suitable as a base action.  The barrels are 
> constructed by a machinist/gunsmith then sent to me for final assembly, 
> regulation and finish work.  The process is one of sleeving the shotgun 
> barrels and modifying the extractors for the new cartridge and finishing the 
> muzzles.  This is a simplified description, as the actual process is 
> proprietary.  It does produce a nice finished gun that anybody would be proud

The only reason I put the Beretta in the listing is some folks like the idea of trade over devalued Obama bucks.  Well, I got 2 inquiries on the Beretta and none on the Glock.  I actually traded the Beretta to a fine man from Hillsboro for $6.50 in coin, silver coin that is.  We are both happy with the deal.

I am still looking for a Glock 19C

I am looking for a Glock 19C used, but in decent shape, at least generation 3. Night sights would be great, but not necessary.  Of course, the more mags and the less rounds down range, the better.

I like to have the original box and manuals with the weapon, but not having them is not a deal breaker.

A nice polymer outside waist band holster would be a plus. I have no use for an inside waist band holster, as I have too much of me inside my waistband to have room for the holster, also.

I have cash in hand and looking for a deal. I am willing to travel approx 50 miles from NW Columbus to close a deal. 

The only possible trade I have is a 1955 Beretta 950bb, .22 short pocket pistol. It is a cute little piece, excellent for a lady's purse for legal ccw carry.

When Winchester was clever enough to figure out this design flaw, they started offering a new Model 12 if the owners would turn in the 11.  So why did Winchester continue to make it until 1925??  Odd.  

This prized old scattergun is complete, with easy functioning cocking pieces.  (but it is scary to cycle it)  The furniture is smooth and in very good condition.  The metal finish is rough, but for the most part, not pitted.  Sporting the serial number 742XX, this strange piece of history is an excellent wall-hanger and conversation piece.

My asking price is $1100, but all things in life are negotiable.  Actually as a capitalist, I never thought I would say this, but I really would rather not accept devalued Obama bucks.  I will gladly accept  silver, either US 90% coin or .999 bullion, at full spot price, in trade for your opportunity to own a rare piece of US history.

Pics maybe tomorrow, too tired tonight.  Thanks for looking."

I have a brand new AR, not a round threw it yet. DPMS flat top upper with plum crazy lower (lifetime warranty). Also mounted on top is a Millet DMS (Designated Marksman Scope) in 1-4 power with an illuminated reticle mounted on a quick detatch mount. $550 for the gun alone or $700 for the gun with scope and mount. 

This is one heck of a deal. Feel free to price this individually as others have done, but don't forget shipping, FFL transfers, sales tax ect. Even not taking all of that stuff into consideration, I'm loseing money. So with that said, My price is FIRM. Do not waste either of our time trying to lowball me. If you're looking for a good deal, well here it is. Almost 20% off what you could possible build it for! If you're looking for me to give it away any more than I already am, You're in the wrong ad. Keep shopping.

The lower was taken off a complete gun and sold separately for some reason, and the upper was also taken off of a new complete gun and sold separately. Before even firing a single round through the rifle I had the Midwest free float rail professionally installed on the rifle along with a troy flip up front gas block sight. The bushnell TRS-1, foliage magpul rail covers, and foliage magpul forward grip are not included with the rifle. If you really want them we can talk.

Because I was trying to make a poor mans colt 6940 I bought the exact same flip up rear sight that is able to adjust for different ranges. I am including this sight with the gun and the rifle is zeroed using federal American eagle tactical 55gr fmj. This rifle has ran flawlessly the entire time I’ve owned it.


This rifle has been a range queen only and it’s never seen hard use or rough treatment. I really hate to see this go, but my wife and I are trying to build a new home and some of my toys have to go in order to make that happen. I want this rifle to go to a good home and to somebody who is going to appreciate it.

This rifle has been a range queen only and it’s never seen hard use or rough treatment. I don't know how it got there but there is a significant scratch on the side of the barrel. The pictures show it pretty well I think. It's been cleaned after every trip to the range and currently the rifle is sighted in with Federal American Eagle 55gr FMJ ammo for 300 yards and I made a small paint mark on the elevation dial for where the rifle hits using that ammo at 400 yards. I meant to do the same for 500 yards, but never got around to it."

I just couldn’t help myself. When I got home I noticed that the action was a little loose and after taking it to a gunsmith to have him inspect it he said I should send it in to the factory for repair. I sent the gun in and when it got back it locked up like a bank vault. I am selling the rifle as I bought it with the factory scope and camo stocks. I have a set of the survivor stock with the hollow cavities but I’d like to keep them. If you really are interested in those as well just let me know. The picture shows the gun with a burris scope that’s not included.

I really haven’t shot the rifle much, and when I’m being completely honest with myself I don’t really need it. I bought the gun on a whim and it’s been a range queen. It’s never seen hard use or rough treatment. I really hate to see this go, but my wife and I are trying to build a new home and some of my toys have to go in order to make that happen. I want this rifle to go to a good home and to somebody who is going to appreciate it.

143,http://www.armslist.com/posts/186143,For Sale:  DPMS 308B 18” heavy bull barrel target 308 Winchester with upgrades.,"South West, Fort Wayne, Indiana",$ 850,"Listed On: Wednesday, August 31, 2011",Rifles,DPMS                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I bought this DPMS 308B brand new about a year and a half ago. It came with the A3 upper receiver that has the dust cover and forward assist, and I also had them put on the 6 position stock that I later upgraded to the Magpul stock because it’s much more comfortable shooting a 308 with a rubber butt pad. I also changed out the trigger and replaced it with a Rock River Arms two stage match. If you’ve never shot a rifle with one of those triggers in it you need to know that it’s a very light trigger and it breaks very cleanly. I also replaced the factory grip the a magpul grip and I have all the accessories that come with it. I also replaced the factory charging handle with a bravo company machine gunfighter charging handle. 

Using Federal Gold Medal Match 168gr ammo this rifle groups right at ½” at 100 yards. This rifle is a shooter and has a fairly tight chamber to prove it. The rifle runs great and I’ve been using it with a SWFA Super Sniper 10X for shooting out to 800 yards. I’ve been lucky and hit targets at 900 & 1000 yards, but with an 18” barrel it’s got to be a pretty hot day to make those hits and you need some luck on your side. 

The rifle comes with an assortment of magazines. There are 4 C-Products, 5 Magpul, and two DPMS 20 round magazines. There is also a C-Products 5rd, and a 10rd magazine just in case you ever wanted to take this hunting. The 5 round magazine sticks in the mag well a little but still functions well. It adds up to 235 rounds of loaded magazine capacity.

If you’re thinking of flip up iron sights on this you’re going to need to know that the gas block and upper receiver have a height difference that is made up by using a extended height front flip up sight on the gas block. I never did it, but I know a lot of guys who want those sights and I wanted to be up front about it. It shouldn’t be a problem, but there is another factor to take into consideration.

All in all, this rifle is an outstanding value. It’s a powerful, accurate, and compact semi auto 308. This rifle has been a range queen only and it’s never seen hard use or rough treatment. I really hate to see this go, but my wife and I are trying to build a new home and some of my toys have to go in order to make that happen. I want this rifle to go to a good home and to somebody who is going to appreciate it.

This is in response to the inquiry for flood guns. Please note everyone here on armslist that selling and then shipping the gun to a non ffl agent out of state is illegal under federal law with the BATF. I am not sure about shipping a gun to a person in the same state if that requires FFL transfer but be weary of a person who wants to pay you cash somehow through the mail and then wants you to just ship guns off to some place. People have frequently used the alias of marine or army person credentials as a part of classics scams on craigslist you’ve been warned stay safe everyone :)

"""" If you have guns ruined by the huricane flood I'll buy them! Price depends on the item. Don't worry about cleaning them up just hose off most of the mud so they won't weigh so much. If you have a collection that is ruined - I'll buy the whole lot for ONE MONEY. I am also looking for old barn or basement,guns in working order or not, i want them for decorating a theme room,so old rusty-ok will pay cash, how much depends on the item/items. Don't bother to clean them up. Just hose off most of the mud and stick in UPS. You will not be selling to a gang member or thug. I am a retired US.

I'm the first and only owner of this gun.  This is a great little gun!!!  It is in better than perfect condition.  The barrel lug and feed ramp has been polished to a mirror finish.  The gun has been completely stripped, deburred, and all metal to metal contact points polished.  All metal parts have been ""Eezoxed"" before it was put back together.  Synthetic gun grease is used on the slide rails.  I have replaced the stock recoil spring set with a Wolff 13lbs. spring set.  This cuts down recoil and keeps the extracted brass from flying to far.  The original Ruger recoil spring set is included also.  Some people have experienced their LCP's to be ammo specific.  I must say this gun eats anything I've put thru it including Hornady Critical Defense.  The gun functions flawlessly.  All the original paperwork, box, and extras for both the gun and the laser are included.  Additional items included are 3 mags with finger extension (flat floor plates included for all 3), Galco pocket holster for no CTC, Remora pocket holster for CTC, Uncle Mike's IWB for CTC, 1 Box 25 rounds 102 gr.

They measure 36 inches wide by 42 1/2 inches high and 10 inches deep with a sturdy weight of 42 pounds each. They can be bolted to a wall or to each other side by side or stacked on top of one another. Yes these are the same weapons racks that fill armories all across our nation holding our military's weapon systems. 

I'm looking to get $75 each, but feel free to make a fair offer, these are in excellent condition.


These racks work great for securley holding M16 style rifles like AR15 sporting rifles, various shotguns, and anything else that fits them."

Witness pistols are produced in Italy. The EAA Witness pistol is one of the most versatile designs in the industry. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery, providing quality craftsmanship. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped, so that it points more naturally. The slide in frame produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot.

Must have this handgun transferred into your name at a local gun shop.

As far as I can tell, this is a correct gun built in May of 1918. The barrel MW measures a perfect 0, not sure what the TE is. I have only fired 5 rounds through this gun, all of which were dead on at 100 yards. Don't know what the total round count is but it can't be much.The stock has been sanded and refinished at some point but you can still see the circled ""P"" stamped in it (see pics) which makes me think it is a correct stock.

I've personally put a couple hundred rounds through this rifle without a single jam. It's been cleaned after every outing. The bore is clean and well groved. No pitting.
The stock is in excellent shape with the normal amount of wear and marks of a 50+ year old rifle that has been used and loved.

The rifle comes with the high-top scope mount and scope. This mount allows use of the iron sights or scope. It's a standard 4x32mm scope. It also had a tapco 20rd composite magazine. The cleaning kit is included inside the spring door in the stock

I am also including the original receiver and internal 10rd magazine along with 60rd of Wolf 7.62x39 ammo. Also along with those I'm throwing in the 7.62x39 Laser bore sight i have, used to sight in your scope. Slide it in the chamber lock it and zero in the scope.

The price is 350$ I'm fairly firm on that. I've looked around and that seems to be the going price for a standard SKS in good condition. This one comes with added accessories AND original parts along with some ammo.

I'm not really looking for any trades but I'm will to work something out if you're giving me a pretty good deal.

Serious inquiries only please. I am available to show the gun to a prospective buyer in the evenings. Please don't waste my time or yours if you don't plan to buy."

It's a .22LR in caliber for thoes who don't know. It has a 10+1 capacity. It comes with the standard 1 mag. I paid 349.99 plus tax from Vance outdoors in March of this year. I bouggt it to teach my wife how to shoot and get used to the feel and recoil of a firearm before introducing her to higher calibers. Back on topic sorry, I took it to the range once I put 150 rounds of CCI hyper-velocity through it. I had zero problems with it, it was flawless. I was surprised considering it hadn't been broken in most companies project it takes between 500-1000 rounds through a .22LR to be broken in and they say you may experience malfuntions untill it is broken in. Contact a gunsmith to confirm what I say. Im selling the gun because I'm now going through a divorce and no longer need or want it.

It was manufactured, in Tochigi, Japan.  The Model 101, has many standard features:  Among them are: A brass bead front sight, a gold-plated, single selective trigger that gives the shooter instantaneous choice of barrels to fire either barrel first by simply setting the selector (which also doubles as the safety); automatic ejectors which flip out only spent shells when the gun is opened, or broken; chrome-lined bores; intricate hand engraving on the receiver; and a light ventilated rib which provides a fiat sighting plane and helps to cool the barrels.
