This beaut has only been through 100 rounds! Has a nice black parkerized finish. Well maintained and cared for. slide action racks smooth like butter. This is by far the best double action I've ever felt from a non match grade pistol, the single action is a gentle short pull; alongside with its solid feel, I've been able to double tap targets successfully from 65 yards.

Hate to see this one go, but I need the cash. Trades are most certainly welcomed, more so partial trades with cash.

I researched it thoroughly before purchasing this. It is more reliable than a Saiga and more durable than a Mossberg. Short 18"" barrel with a 6+1 capacity, and you can reload between shots without needing to change magazines. Being gas-operated with a steel receiver it is one of the lightest recoiling 12 gauge shotguns ever made, and it blows fist sized holes in things as fast as you can pull the trigger.  This is a very well thought out design.

The prior owner purchased it new and had some custom work done to it to make it even better:
*Mesa Tactical Urbano stock with adjustable cheek riser and Limbsaver recoil pad.
*Mesa Tactical 6-round side saddle with Picatinny rail if you want to mount an optic.
*Nordic Components charging handle.
*Nordic Components mag clamp (a mini-rail can be ordered for $17 to mount a flashlight on said clamp).
*Oversized safety installed by Bowers Tactical, who also polished the bolt release.
*Condor Tactical shotgun scabbard with gear pouch.
*Assorted small parts & cleaning kit.
*Manual & warranty card.

VERY LOW ROUND COUNT from the prior owner, mostly Federal birdshot. I've only owned this shotgun for a few weeks and have not fired it. This is an outstanding shotgun, but just not the right choice for me. Due to an injury I have difficulty handling an 8 pound assault weapon without a sling.

I was going to order the mini-tac rail for the mag clamp (part # TRL-BCT-150) to mount a flashlight and a Tru-Glo fiberoptic front sight, but never got around to it. I highly recommend these items to the new owner.  A red dot or holographic sight can be mounted on the top rail, or you can remove it and mount ghost rings.  Many possible options.   

I did, however, purchase a lot of buckshot: 6 unopened boxes of Winchester #1 Buck, 6 unopened boxes of Winchester Mil-Spec 00 Buck, and a pair of A-Zoom snap caps. That is 60 rounds of the BEST buckshot available, plus a pair of training rounds to practice reloads and dry fire.

Not really looking for trades, but will consider fair and reasonable offers. I'm partial to 20 gauge doubles, .38 snubs, and quality single-stack 9mms. If someone has a short AR with collapsible stock that would work too.  

Colorado sale only.  Will not ship.  Will not travel too far beyond greater Denver area.  No bill of sale required, but must be a legal CO resident and not a dirtbag.

Nothing wrong with the old one, just building a new STW that is exactly what I've always wanted.

The rifle for sale is a Sako model 995 - Factory original - no upgrades or changes other than a trigger job (2lbs, breaks like glass). For those not familiar with this rifle, It is built on the TRG-S action, which is a 3 lug push feed design. It has a 26"" medium contour free floated barrel, black synthetic monte carlo stock with a nice palm swell.  The action is a matte blue finish and the barrel & bolt handle are a high luster blue.  One feature I really like is the detachable box magazine which holds 4 rounds and is plenty long to seat bullets out there.  I bought it 10 years ago and have only shot 60 rounds through it, all factory loads.  Always functioned perfectly.  Gun is in 99.9% condition. For me this rifle was always a pleasure to shoot, recoil very manageable, probably due to the stock design.  I have 2 sets of Sako rings (med & high) that mate with the integral dovetail bases on the receiver. The rifle weighs 9.2 lbs with a brand new Leupold 4.5x14x40 matte VX3 CDS on it.  I would sell with or without the scope.

Colt Officers ACP model. 

It is the enhanced model. The enhanced model has the slanted slide serrations, lowered and flared ejection port, flat top slide, combat hammer, two piece recoil spring. 
Comes in it's original blue plastic case with paperwork. 
It has the 3.5 inch barrel. It is wearing silver alumagrips. Other than the grip change it is all original.

Has some slight small blemishes on the right side of the slide that I was not able to capture in the photos. They are not scratches that can be felt and would probably disappear with a bit of 44/40. 

To my knowledge they no longer produce the officers models and when they did only about 3% were enhanced, so this is a relatively unique piece.

Comes with original magazine, Wilson combat magazine, 2 factory magazines with Wilson followers and pachmayr base pads. Wooden grips with colt medallions and some vz (I believe) tan grips.

Asking $825 
Thanks.

Please note the ONLY trades I am interested in are for a fullsize Colt enhanced or XSE model in similar condition.

This gun has the original factory open sights.   It has has what looks like high gloss Leupold base and high gloss Leupold rings that were professionally mounted.  I had Robert Parker of Parker Arms install a very nice aftermarket (riflebasix), two stage, fully adjustable trigger (cost was a little over $200.00) .  The Original, factory trigger is also included. This gun is in excellent condition.

Serial # puts the date of manufacture at 1970.

I shot one box of Hornady VMax 40gr through this gun (empty brass and box included).  Took 10 shots to zero my scope.  The next 10 shots at 200 yards went into a group that I could cover with a 50 cent piece.  To say I was amazed at the accuracy of this factory gun is an understatement.  I don't have a use for this gun and am tired of it just sitting in my safe.

The rings and mount are included, the brass is included and the two triggers are included.  The scope is not included.  Considering all the aftermarket additions to this gun I think $595.00 is a very fair price.  No trades at this time.  Thanks."

I'd like to sell this two guns.

1- 
Marlin XT-22TR with Simmons .22Mag 4x32 scope.
Bought this one few months ago in Gander, the scope, scope mount, sling about a month ago.
Only use this gun in the backyard for few hundred of CB bullets, I love this set up, the scope is awesome, simple and crystal clear.
Gun and scope comes with its boxes and all the stuff it came with.
$220 (that's less than what I paid for the gun ONLY)

2-
H&R SS1-017 17HMR with Simmons .44Mag 4-12X44.
This one bought it new only couple weeks ago.
This gun with this scope is frikking awesome, almost like a binocular, already sight it.
Only took this gun out once and shot 2 boxes of 50. That's IT! 
The mount I put is a one piece H&R made os a material that is harder than aluminium, have the same on my 45-70. GREAT mount. Also comes with a very nice sling
Everything in this gun is in new condition with all the boxes and stuff they came with. 
$320 (I'm taking a big hit on this one)

$480 for both!


reason for selling (if anyone need to know) is that for once I already have a H001T Henry and don't need 2 .22s and got hot on a .223 and the only way I can afford it is giving up something. 

I'm in Orange County

I did a lot of research before buying this gun and came to the conclusion that this is one of the most versatile guns out there. It's HEAVY with a steel frame, so it's manageable even with full power .357 loads, and a dream to shoot with cheaper .38's. The 3 inch barrel has a longer sight radius for more accuracy and respectable velocities for defense loads, over the much more common 2"" model. The weight and barrel length make this gun less than ideal for every day concealed carry, but for a gun that will see some range time I think they're necessary compromises.

This gun also has the upgrades to fix every complaint I've ever heard about the SP101. The spring has been replaced for a lighter DA trigger pull. The front sight has been replaced with a low profile night sight (fixed sight in the rear). The stock grips have been replaced with an extremely comfortable Hogue Monogrip. I still have the extra springs however the original grips have been misplaced. 

Gun comes in original box (which has been slightly modified to fit gun with aftermarket grip) with three speedloaders and some ammo and once-used .38 brass if you're a reloader. Cash price is $450 firm. I might be willing to trade for a GP100 or the right 9mm."

Note on Ammunition:
==============
These shotguns were originally imported by ATI, which also imported 36 caliber Turkish shotgun shells (.410 2.5""), and can picky when it comes to ammo because of the inconsistencies in exploded hull lengths of American-made shotgun ammunition.

The best ammunition to run through these guns is Winchester Super X .410 2.5"" Rifled Slugs (X41RS5), and I'm including 13 boxes of it with the sale.

Care and Maintenance:
===============
Be sure to keep the gun well lubricated and use blue loctite on all threaded components and it will run fine.

Asking $700 OBO. Cash offers only, no trades. My asking price is well below what it cost me as illustrated above and want the cash to finance other projects.

FTF personal transfers to Missouri Residents Only with a valid ID (I'm a Missouri resident). All others need to go through an FFL, but if you're a Kansas resident in the KC area, I can meet you at your FFL to perform the transfer to save on shipping.

I'm also willing to do an out of state transfer, but would need payment and a copy of your FFL's license prior to shipping.

The Kel-Tec P-11 is the smallest and lightest 9mm ever made. Thanks to its
locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical
accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially suited
for plainclothes police officers or as a secondary weapon for military
personnel. All machined components are also made on modern high speed
computerized equipment. Equally advanced quality control equipment and test
procedures ensure a firearm with uncompromising quality in materials and
workmanship.  Available with a 10 round magazine capacity and choice of 
parkerized, hard chrome or blue finishes.

With the help of a big U.S. government contract, Kimber of Oregon has set out to change the situation. The firm won a contract to make 20,000.22 rimfire target rifles, all capable of firing .700"" or smaller groups at 50 yds. with target ammunition. The loading platform of the singleshot Model 82 is inserted in the receiver and incorporates the ejector. The action is securely fastened to the stock by a pair of heavy screws; one through the rear of the steel trigger guard into the rear tang and the other through the handstop rail into the recoil lug. The recoil lug is dovetailed to the receiver, which is grooved to accept the rear sight. Most of the Australian-made rear sight components are steel, with the housing and mounting bar made of a non-ferrous alloy. The mounting base secures to the corresponding receiver dovetail with two heavy clamping screws. The entire mounting system appears abundantly secure and allows the sight to be removed and reinstalled with minimal impact change. The adjustment knobs are heavily grooved for easy turning and are located at the top and left side of the sight. Each is clearly marked for direction and scale, allowing easy return to any previous setting. The adjustments are faithful to their claimed 1/5 minute of angle (m.o.a.) increments. No backlash was noted. The front sight is of the standard globe type and is made of a non-ferrous alloy. The 10 interchangeable inserts and the screw-in sight face and back are steel. The three post sizes and seven apertures that make up the front sight insert set seem adequate for shooting at most ranges and under varying light conditions. The safety lever is typical of Kimber sporting .22s and is ""rolled"" on and off to positive stops. It cannot be applied unless the action is cocked. The bolt handle is not locked when the safety is applied. The trigger assembly is fully adjustable for weight of pull, overall travel and sear engagement. The three trigger adjusting screws (accessible after the barrelled action has been removed from the stock) are each provided with two locking screws. An inspection port allows viewing of the sear/trigger engagement. The instruction book states that rifles are shipped with triggers adjusted to a pull weight between 3.5 and 4.5 lbs., and that the trigger should not be adjusted to less than 2 lbs. Notwithstanding all that, the sample rifle tested at a very crisp 3 lbs., and no further adjustment was deemed necessary. The instructions further state that the rifle should not be dry-fired, but it may be uncocked by holding the trigger to the rear as the bolt is closed. The cylindrical 25"" barrel, factoryfitted with three sight bases (for scope mounts and the front sight) has a diameter of .928"". It has a 1 in 16"" righthand twist and is completely freefloated. The manufacturer warns against the use of all types of Short, Long or hypervelocity cartridges. Match quality ammunition suggested. Three buttstock spacers allow the length of pull to be adjusted between 117/8"" and 133/8"". The fore-end's accessory rail accepts the factory-supplied round hand stop. Fit and finish were in keeping with other target arms in this price range. All metal parts were well polished and nicely blued. The walnut stock had some visible figure and a low-luster finish. The Kimber Model 82 was fired for accuracy, with results shown in the accompanying table, and function-fired with a variety of ammunition. There were no failures of any kind, and accuracy results showed the Kimber test rifle capable of staying within the 10ring of the 50-yd. and 50-meter targets used in conventional smallbore competition."

Glock 22 .40 with a bridge mount and red dot. Comes with case, factory 10rnd mag and a 29rnd extended mag. Fresh duracoat black bout 3 weeks ago so it has had plenty of time to set up. I personally have put roughly 100rnds through it with no malfunctions at all even with the extended mag. The bridge mount has a rail on the bottom for lights and other accessories. Looking for offers cash or trade. Not interested in 9mm or .380. Will consider handguns assault style rifles, unique guns, complete reloading setups for .40 and or .223, and of course cash. According to gun digest this gun books at $350 in very good and $495 in perfect without the accessories I would place it somewhere in the middle of very good and perfect and then add the accessories in just to give you an idea of what its worth so you dont give me some ridiculous offer.

Currently it just sits in the safe and doesn't get the use that it is meant for. If you're wanting to make a 1500 yard shot or further then THIS is the perfect rifle for you. Another great feature is the fact that you can change calibers on this rifle to other popular sniper rounds in under two minutes. The barrels and bolts needed are available online. Below is some good info about the rifle, and if you have ANY questions please feel free to ask. ***I'll consider a partial trade for top tier 1911 and/or AR*** The Tactical 2 is the most advanced version of the precision rifle developed by Blaser. Each design element was driven by the requirement to create the best shooting platform possible. Exceptional accuracy was one of the key principles during development, with effective engagement ranges of 1500 meters or more, depending on caliber and ammunition. Advanced engineering and uncompromising quality are evident in every facet of design. The Tactical 2 is a bolt action rifle featuring Blaser’s revolutionary straight-pull action. When the bolt is closed, the 360 degree radial collet expands into the locking groove in the barrel – the bolt head is auto-centering and self-headspacing. The straight pull action features no rotating parts and assures rapid reloading with minimum movement. The rifle can easily be converted for left or right hand shooters. Interchange calibers by replacing the barrel and bolt head, in under a minute, without special tools and no change in accuracy. Barrels are cold hammer forged, fluted and plasma-nitrided to provide maximum resistance against corrosion and abrasion. An M1913 Picatinny rail is fixed to the barrel, ensuring full compatibility with a wide range of optical sighting systems. The muzzle end is threaded for an optional muzzle brake"
