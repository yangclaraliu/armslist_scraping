He has a New Haven Connecticut, USA made, Winchester Model 70 Black Shadow in .270 WSM with a 3-9x40 scope. The gun has a mat black finish on the metal and composite stock that is perfect for hunting. There are no reflections or mirror finishes to spook game. 

He bought the gun three years ago but it has been used very little. My best estimate would be that he has fired less than a box of shells through it. The gun is stock and in like new condition. The only modification was the addition of a LimbSaver recoil pad that really tames the recoil!

The family is facing financial difficulties and need to liquidate everything they can ASAP. Cash talks.

I know the gun & can vouch for it being in like-new condition.

Gun can be seen in Orange/Durham County area.

Asking $400 (was $500) but THEY ARE OPEN TO ALL OFFERS.

This is a unique one of a kind rifle that would be a trophy in any  collection!!
This has been a ‘safe-queen’ and has one Very Small ding…see picture with ‘dime’. I have owned this for many years…bought it from original owner who put less than 100 rounds thru it. I have shot exactly 20 rounds in it (Hornady factory loads). It is one, if not the, most accurate rifle I have ever owned including my Blazer, Dakota Arms and others. See factory test target…even the new ones cannot beat it!!
Looks new, bore and crown are excellent…you will not be unhappy with this rifle.
I am retired, and enjoy trading...and trying different guns.
Please contact me with any questions…I will respond to all questions, promptly.
$1900....This would cost ~$4000 to reproduce

For those who aren't familiar with these, they were made in the same valley as Beretta in Italy by Tanfoglio, but these pistols were made for the Israeli market and thus have ""MOSSAD"" with two 6 point ""Star of David"" on the slide.  Frame says ""Made by Fratelli Tanfoglio S.P.A. for ""Weapons House LTD"" - Israel""  Grips show some wear and there is some wear on the frame, but these were used mostly in gun clubs I believe so they all show wear, most more than this one.  I picked a pretty nice one from an early shipment of these, then bought a compact version later (somewhat rarer) then another full size, so I'm selling this full size one to buy something different.  Bore/barrel look good, no pitting  and good distinct grooves, 9mm 16 round mag double stack.  One mag included, but mags are plentiful as they take the same mags as Baby Eagle, Jericho, Springfield p9 and Witness pistols, this pistol is the same basic design as all of those, cosmetically most different from the Baby Eagle/Jericho.  I've put around 100 rounds through the gun and it ate any ammo I fed it flawlessly, even the cheap stuff.  Several people fired the gun that day and everyone loved it and felt it was very accurate.  It produced some very nice groupings that day, even at distances of 20-30 feet.  There is no way I'd sell this if I didn't have another full size of this same gun, it is a great shooter and this one still looks pretty dern good.  Looking for $325 cash on this.  All laws apply, pistol permit or CCH permit required."

Will consider trades for bolt action rifles or higher end shotguns - maybe handguns? 

I'm looking for firearms that are worth above 600 when you bought them, let me know what you have. I'm moving in 2 weeks - so I need this set GONE and figure a rifle or shotgun is easier to transport than a whole drumset."

Mauser Gew. 98 - original model 1898 Mauser rifle Very Good Condition with Yugoslavian Crest on Barrel, Very Accurate and powerful (see photo) 
Mauser Gew. 98 - original model 1898 Mauser rifle.

Magazine capacity: 5 rounds in integral box magazine
The Mauser company, established by the two Mauser brothers, established its reputation in firearms making in the last decades of the XIX century, and continued to build a very well thought-out and skillfully built firearms until the end of the World War 2. Some of earlier Mauser works became the standards against which all others designs are judged, even after some 100 years after its introduction. One of such designs, is undoubtfully a Mauser model 1898 rifle, also known as Gew. 98 or simply G98 (G = Gewehr, rifle in German). This rifle was designed from the experience, gained on previous Mauser designs, and was first appeared in 1898 as a standard German army infantry rifle. It was carried by Germans through the First World war, along with carbine shortened version, known as K98 (or Kar-98, from Karbiner = carbine). In the 1904 Germans were first to introduce the new, ""spitzer"" bullet (with pointed tip, instead of the older blunt, round-shaped tip). New bullet had much better long-range ballistic, so all sights were regraduated for new ammunition.
Many versions of this design also were licensed to other countries, which also used to build their own versions of the G98. Most famous of those ""foreign Mausers"" are Persian Mausers, Turkish Mausers, Czech VZ-24 Mausers, Yugoslavian Mausers and some others. The list of the vast variety of the Mauser-type versions could easily cover a number of pages, but, for the sake of compactness, I will describe only the basic, German model.
The model 98 rifle is a manually operated, magazine fed, bolt action rifle. The magazine and the bolt action are the two most famous features of the model 98. Magazine is a two-row, integral box, with quickly detachable floorplate. Magazine could be topped either with single rounds, by pushing rounds into the receiver top opening, or via the stripper clips. Each clip can hold 5 rounds, enough to fill the magazine, and is inserted into the clip guides, machined into the rear receiver bridge. After the loading, empty clip is ejected automatically when bolt is closed. Magazine could be unloaded by operating the bolt (safety must be in the middle position!) or by removing the magazine floorplate (not recommended).
Mauser bolt is a simple, extremely strong and well thought out design. The bolt has three locking lugs, two at the bolt head and one at the rear part of the bolt. The bolt handle is rigidly attached to the bolt body. On the original Gew 98 rifles it was straight and located horizontally when bolt was in the closed position. On the K98k the bolt handle was bent down, which allowed for more comfortable carrying and bolt operations. Bolt has a gas vent holes that are designed to move the hot gases away from the shooters face and into the magazine opening in the case of the cartridge case or primer rupture. Next famous feature of the model 98 bolt is a ""controlled feed"" extractor. Massive, non-rotating claw extractor was designed to engage the cartridge rim as soon as cartridge left the magazine, and held the cartridge case firmly until it was ejected by the ejector, fixed inside the receiver. Combined with a slight bolt retraction at the last stage of the bolt turn-open rotation, caused by the cammed surface on the rear receiver bridge, this resulted in very positive primary extraction. Model 98 is a striker-fired weapon. Striker is cocked when bolt is rotated to open, allowing for smoother forward bolt pull. The rear part of the striker is protruded from within the bolt, so state of the action (cocked or not) can be checked visually or even manually. The bolt group can be easily removed from the receiver simply by pulling out the bolt stop, located at the left wall of the receiver, and then by rotating and pulling the bolt out. The safety switch is located at the rear of the bolt and has three positions: in the left position (when looking from behind the rifle) it locks the sear and also locks the bolt in place, so it could not be rotated and opened. in the middle (raised) position it still locks the sear, but bolt is unlocked and could be operated, to load and unload the rifle; and in the right position, the rifle is ready to fire. Safety could be easily operated by the right thumb finger.
Model 98 rifle featured a one-piece wooden stock with semi-pistol grip. Gew 98 and Kar 98K differ not only in the length of the barrel and the front part of the stock - they also have different sling mountings. While Gew 98 has two sling swivels, the K98k has only one, forward swivel. Instead of the rear swivel there's a through cut in the buttstock, through which the sling is passed. Those rifles also have different rear sights: Gew 98 have a curved, tangent sight, while K98k has more modern, leaf type rear sight. Front sights are of open, barleycorn type, on some carbines with removable semi-circular front sight hoods."
