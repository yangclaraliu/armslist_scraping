	Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Madsen model 1947 rifle, also know as ""the MADSEN Lightweight Military Rifle"" or ""Colombian Navy M1958 rifle"", was designed and manufactured by Dansk Industrie Sindikat ""Madsen"" A.S., mostly to be offered for 3rd world countries, whose armies had not enough funds to buy and maintain semi- or full-automatic infantry rifles. This rifle was first offered in DISA / Madsen catalogs in 1947, but initially found no buyers, as world arms markets were flooded with surplus rifles of the WW2 era, and the focus of military interests shifted from bolt action rifles towards semi-automatic and automatic rifles. In 1958 Colombian Navy made an order for Madsen Model 1947 rifles in caliber .30-06 US. Total production of the  Madsen model 1947 rifles is estimated at around 5-6 thousands rifles. The Madsen model 1947 rifle is often called 'the last military bolt action rifle', as it was designed and manufactured when bolt-action rifles finally became obsolete as standard military rifles.

The Madsen model 1947 rifle is manually operated bolt action rifle. It uses rotary bolt action with dual locking lugs, located at the rear of the bolt body. Bolt lugs engage cuts, made on the inner receiver walls just behind the magazine housing. The cocking handle is located at the middle of the bolt and bent down for more comfortable carry. Manual safety is located at the rear of the bolt, and has two position. When it points to the left, rifle is ready to fire; when it points up, rifle is set to 'safe', it cannot fire and bolt is locked. Rifle is fed from integral, non-detachable box magazine that holds 5 rounds. Magazine is reloaded from the top, when the bolt is opened, using single rounds or stripper clips. Sighting equipment consist of the protected front sight and aperture type rear sight, which is adjustable for windage and range between 100 and 900 meters. To decrease felt recoil of the rifle, it is equipped with integral muzzle brake and a rubber buttplate."

The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance.

At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance.

The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 hardcoat anodized. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle.

In 5.56 NATO and 6.8 SPC, the REC7 is everything you’d expect from a Barrett rifle, and then some.

I used one of these collars to train my dog to stay on my property even though I have no fences.

Example: 1 beep = turn left; 2 beeps = turn right;  3 beeps = come back.

+ Eight different levels of static shock stimulation available to correct the behavior of your dog. 

Example:  Press red button for 3 beeps. . if dog does not respond, press white button number 2 for a static shock and re-press red button again for 3 beeps. If dog still does not respond, press white button number 3 or 4 and then re-press red button for 3 beeps.

	I am selling my .40cal Sig Sauer P226 SCT. I have had this gun for about 3 years and used it as my duty weapon for 1yr. It hasn't left my bedside in over a year. Sadly I am in one of those situations where I do not want to sell, but need the money. So here we are! With the pistol I am offering a Streamlight TLR-3 rail light and Blackhawk Duty Holster. This is a $1000 handgun any day of the week and I have kept perfect care of it. I doubt it has fired more than 3,000 rounds. Please e-mail me with any questions. I have many more pictures than this site allows me to post. Also it has both front and rear night sights.

Thank you, -Zach Benton

For $1000 you get: The gun, 4 15round mags, 40rounds of hollow point ammunition, the Streamlight rail light, and Blackhawk holster.

For $900 you get: The gun, mags, and ammo.

""Product description from the SigSauer website: The P226® SCT is an all black, Nitron® finished P226 featuring front cocking serrations, a SIGLITE® rear night sight, a TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and comes with four 15-round magazines for the .40S&W version."""

    Thank you for understanding.
f) I will ask for a copy of your WI DL and to sign a bill of sale - if you can't do that...well, no deal

Now...  1993 Izhmash /Izmach SVD Dragunov - Tigr (tiger) variant.
exactly 1001 of these are in the USA and 100 more of a complete military variant (which go for about $30K if they ever come up for sale).  this is not a PSL or AK - this is a machined (nothing stamped that matters) weaponry.
Rifle was babied and only non-corrosive ammo shot.  
Original 4x PSO (illuminated), I upgraded to 1.5LED with AA battery cover, since Russian batteries are too rich for me.  However, original set of 2.5v replacement lamps and battery cover is included.  Also, has a retractable original sunshade, sun filter and rubber eye piece.
(3) three - 5rd magazines
(2) two - 10rd magazines (these are actually unissued, brand new and still in the grease paper from Russia, I have not shot em yet)
original scope cover
original grey field/soft bag/case
Russian SVD bayonet
(2) two Belarus made scope rails - low and midium profile - will allow you to use your regular pictanny rings + own scope(s).  All PSO scopes during soviet times were made in Belarus, just an FYI
(1) one original cleaning bottle
(1) one orignal cleaning kit - complete
original Tigr buttstock and handguards (wood buttstock/black non-vented handguards)
real Russian Military issue wood handuards
Current military issue polymer stock with cheek pad and vented black polymer handguards (this set is not pictured, as of right now, but is currently installed on the rifle.  other handguards and original buttstock will be included).
(2) two Russian Military issue canvas magazine pouches/carriers (4-magazine kind) -  NEW.
(1) SVD sling (installed), different than a typical AK sling

rifle shoots EXCELLENT.  no issues PERIOD.  taken care of and always cleaned after each shooting session (despite only non-corrosive ammo shot).

-Glock 19, only two magazines fired through the gun with no mishaps of any kind. The gun shows no wear whatsoever and is mint. LNIB. This is the compact version of the Glock 17 and is chambered in 9mm. This gun is a generation III model.

-Glock 21, only two magazines have been fired through this gun as well. I love Glocks, but don't shoot them much. This Glock 21 comes with factory installed night sights and is also in mint condition with no marks whatsoever. This gun is chambered in .45ACP. This is also a generation III model.

-Romanian SAR-1 AK-47. This is a nice AK-47. This AK-47 is not your typical WASR 10/63 rifle. The Romanian SAR-1s were discontinued through importation quite a few years ago so they are not a common rifle anymore. I have fired less than six magazines through this rifle. I refinished the stock set in Cabernet (Russian Red) and the rifle will come with a magazine and sling. This AK-47 is chambered in 7.62x39.


I am looking for Kimber 1911s, Colt 1911s, S&W 1911s, Springfield 1911s (GI MODEL), STAINLESS 1911s, Ruger SR1911, or just about any quality 1911s. I may do a two for one trade if the 1911 is worth it. Don't go thinking you'll be able to just rip me off. I know what each gun is worth and I would rather sell it outright instead of get lowball offers.  I know I can get $500 for the Glock 19, $600 for the Glock 21, and about $700 for the Romanian SAR-1. I've been trading these types of weapons around and know they aren't worth for $400 a piece like you may think. Try getting one from a dealer, even used and abused for that price. If you are going to mention GunBroker this and that, screw off and do not message me because that means NOTHING to me. Thanks for your time."

This revolver has 3 sets of grips: original walnut, Hogue rubber, and boot grips (which are on the gun now). Also comes with a good quality leather holster. This would be an excellent nightstand gun for a novice shooter as it is the most user friendly gun you can find. EXCELLENT overall condition. The original owner told me it had been stored in a safe for 20 years and had a very low round count. I lightly oiled the mainspring and put 50 rounds through it at the range. Trigger is smooth in DA and crisp in SA and it is surprisingly accurate with such a short barrel. I doubt if it has had more than 100 rounds through it altogether.  Looks almost like new.

Price is firm and this is a great deal.  Will meet anywhere in the greater Denver area.  Will not ship.  Buyer must be at least 21 years of age, a legal CO resident, and not a dirtbag.  Cash only, no interest in trades.

This revolver has 3 sets of grips: original walnut, Hogue rubber, and boot grips (which are on the gun now). Also comes with a good quality leather holster. This would be an excellent nightstand gun for a novice shooter as it is the most user friendly gun you can find. EXCELLENT overall condition. The original owner told me it had been stored in a safe for 20 years and had a very low round count. I lightly oiled the mainspring and put 50 rounds through it at the range. Trigger is smooth in DA and crisp in SA and it is surprisingly accurate with such a short barrel. I doubt if it has had more than 100 rounds through it altogether.

This is my nightstand gun, but I want to fund a project I'm trying to finish.

I am asking $280 for this revolver, which is a GREAT deal. I will even throw in a 50 rd box of FMJ target ammo and a box of CorBon HP to get you started. 3 sets of grips and a good holster too. Hell, I'll even throw in a gun case.

Cash only. Not interested in trades. Will meet within the greater Denver area (Lakewood, Aurora, Englewood).

574,http://www.armslist.com/posts/435574,For Sale:  Kel-Tec PF9 package - many extras,"Stuart - Martin County, Florida, United States",$ 360,"Listed On: Saturday, June 16, 2012",Handguns,Kel-Tec                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Have a PF9 up for trade or sale. About 3 months old. Quite possibly the best carry gun made. Super thin and light.

Done a few things to the gun to improve it. A Kel-Tec is meant to be ""finished"" by the owner for the most part. All modifications are easily reversible but I doubt you'd want to.

**This gun shoots MUCH nicer than a stock factory gun.**

- Fluff and Buffed. Gun has been broken down and deburred. Slide rails and feed ramp smoothed. Hammer surface smoothed

- Trigger straightened, softened and shortened. Biggest complaint with this gun is the trigger shape from the factory can ""pinch"" larger fingers. The shorter trigger is MUCH more controllable and softer to shoot. A stock replacement trigger is about 2 bucks from Kel-Tec.

- Hogue grip installed and trimmed. Helps suck up the recoil and improve grip on this little beast.

- +1 extended magazine bottom not only adds a round but vastly improves the gun grip.

- Extra +1 magazine. Any defensive gun needs an extra mag. It also has the +1 extension

- Stainless belt clip. Not installed in the pictures but included. Here is a pic of one installed (mine is stainless, not black)

http://imgur.com/gTW0w (not my gun)

Installation is very simple 2 screws.

- Sights and hammer painted orange. For some reason the white sights and my eyes did not play nicely. Orange is MUCH easier to see and get on target with. Orange hammer means it is much easier to stage the trigger (along with the shortened trigger) for fast accurate shots. Both are ""painted"" with my 5 year olds orange nail polish. It's the type that doesn't need remover. Just ""peels"" off with a toothpick if you don't dig orange. You will though.

- Shimmed rear site. Gun was accurate but this shooter always trended a touch low with it. You may be different. Shim is just a plastic spacer that you can remove if you shoot differently than I do. I'm no marksman.

- Deburred the grip. Has some ridges on it from the factory that can hurt your hands after awhile. An hour with an emery board really smoothed things out.



Also included:

Flat magazine floor plate.

Pinky magazine floor plate (doesn't add a round)

Allen wrench for sight adjustment

Kel-Tec plastic case

Instruction booklets



Not included but possible for the right deal:

Desantis Soft Tuck holster

Uncle Mikes pocket holster



Looking for a compact 9MM such as a Glock 26 or Ruger SR9c. The Kel-Tec is too small for what I need it for now and I have another gun when I need something smaller. Will add cash as needed to the right deal.



A trade is preferred but will sell outright for $360. This is what everything would cost you if you can even find it all plus you'd have to pay tax and shipping.

FTF bill of sale. DL or CWL required.

I'm not. I had wanted to get a threaded 357 Sig barrel to drop in this and throw a suppressor on it. Turns out, it is nearly impossible to get one for less than $300 so I'm going in a different direction. Only 50 rounds through it.

That being said, this is one of the finest guns I've ever owned. I bought it new from Springfield so it has all paperwork, box and XD gear that it shipped with. It is capable of having drop in barrel conversions which is nice. It is a 3.8"" barrel that is astonishingly accurate from reasonable pistol distance. I couldn't believe it. The XDM is a very special pistol. It has a match grade barrel, aggressive molding and some mean slide serrations. Great shooter, confident carry gun. 

Included with this gun will be an Alexap IWB Horsehide Holster that I have carried the gun in for the week or so that I've had it. I am looking to get $550 for the gun, all accessories and the holster.

Since I won't be shooting 40 anymore, I have a whole heap of ammo to go too. 400 rounds of various ammo -- 

200 rounds of Federal 180 grain FMJ's
50 rounds of PMC Bronze 180 grain FMJ's
100 rounds of Remington UMC 180 grain JHP's
50 rounds of Federal 180 grain HST JHP's (XM40HC)

Looking to get $150 for all of the ammo. Won't sell it separately unless the pistol sells first. 

If you buy everything, I'll let it go for $675. Looking to do a deal in Raleigh or I will ship it to your FFL at your expense. This gun must be transferred through a FFL since I bought it through my FFL. I usually use North Raleigh Guns, they charge a $10 transfer fee which is cheaper than I've found elsewhere.

The 92 series of semi automatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. INOX version.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. Sure, Firm Grip: The front and back of the grip are grooved on the 92FS and M9, while the M9A1 and 90-Two feature checkering. The grip frame is flared slightly at the base to enhance pointability and control. 
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.
92 FS. A LEGENDARY FIREARMS. 
The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history.
The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them.

The FN PS90 Triple Rail (TR) gives the operator a wide choice of sighting accessories via its three MIL-STD 1913 rails for mounting optional optical sights, tactical lights and lasers. Chambered in the 5.7x28mm cartridge, the PS90 utilizes straight blowback operation and fires from a closed bolt for greater accuracy and reliability. The PS90’s civilian legal 16.04"" cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel is equipped with an integrated muzzle brake to reduce recoil. Dual magazine latches, cocking handles and an innovative matte black synthetic thumbhole stock with a molded-in sling attachment point help make the PS90 fully ambidextrous.

The SPAS-12 was designed by the Italian company Luigi Franchi Spa as a special purpose, military and police close combat weapon (actually, SPAS stands for Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun, or Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun, depending on the source). It featured a selective action for greater versatility, and can be used as a gas operated semi-automatic repeater or as a manually operated pump action repeater, depending on the mission and ammunition used. Since its introduction SPAS-12 became a very popular police and special-forces weapon, being versatile, reliable and with good firepower. On the other hand, it is heavier than most other similar shotguns and quite complicated, which results in relatively high prices.

SPAS-12 utilizes somewhat traditional for shotguns gas system with annular gas piston locating around the under barrel magazine tube. It operates the bolt with vertically tilting locking lug that engages the barrel extension to lock.SPAS-12 can be switched between gas operated self-loading mode and manually operated pump mode by pressing and holding a button at the bottom of the forearm and pulling the forearm slightly forward for AUTOMATIC mode or backward for PUMP(or MANUAL) mode. Earlier models of the SPAS-12 had the lever type safety at the front of the trigger guard, but due to some deficiencies this was latter replaced by the push-button (cross-bolt) safety at the same place. 

SPAS-12 could be fitted with stamped metallic butt-stock that folds to the top of the receiver when not in use, and with a pistol grip made of plastic. Alternatively, solid plastic butts-tocks with pistol grips are available. Barrel has cylinder bore with screw-on muzzle devices (cokes of flash hiders). Sights usually are of rifle type, with post front and open notch rear sight.

IOTV INFO(WIKI)

The IOTV is designed to take the weight of the vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. The vest is also equipped with a mesh inner cover that is designed to improve airflow inside of the armor. There is also a back pad in the lower back area of the vest, which is designed to defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. However, the back pad does not provide ballistic protection. The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear plates (SAPI NIJ standard III). The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified. This is a huge improvement over the PASGT vest, and the Vietnam era fragmentation vest (which was made of nylon). Both only offered protection against fragmentation.

Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire.

Despite somewhat rough appearance UZI pistols were reliable and quite accurate. It also must be noted that 'original' UZI pistols should not be confused with full-size weapons based on semi-automatic only full-size Uzi carbines but without the shoulder stock.

Magazines are of double stack design, interchangeable with other guns of Uzi family (in 9mm caliber). Sights are of open type, with flip-up rear sight, adjustable for windage.

This rifle has all the original Colt packaging and comes with the original aluminum carrying case. Bundled in the case is all the factory packaging, including the original sling, all the original colt paperwork, original mags, cleaning rods, Tasco scope paperwork, etc. When we say factory packaging, we mean all the way down to the factory cardboard plug that Colt placed in the barrels before shipping. Stored in a climate-controlled warehouse for over 20 years, this Delta HBar is a true treasure. Quick release clip

Originally bought this for my wife as she wanted a gun for protection in the woods but she did not like the feel of the 357 recoil. The gun is a 1976 as you can see in one of the pics the serial and you can search for colt serial numbers and match it to the year. The only this wrong with this revolver is the grips, a chip and a dent on them. I was going to purchase a set of hogue grips for my wife but as she doesn't want this gun I am not going to invest the money. Hogue grips are a little expensive but the feel is tremendous, $100 (depending on what you want) this is the one I was going to get for it.

THIS IS NOT A NIGHT VISION SCOPE.

This rifle scope has sat on my safe-queen Sig 556 since I bought it a few years ago. It will mount to a rail or to an AR carry handle. It's an excellent optic, and lends great capability to any 5.56/.223 rifle at all ranges thanks to the dual-illuminated reticle and bullet drop compensator. By utilizing the Bindon Aiming Concept, this optic functions as a red dot sight for close range, and a precision 4x scope at longer ranges. After very successful testing of a limited number of these ACOG's early in the Iraq War, the Marine Corps bought an ACOG for every rifle and carbine in their inventory. This is no small matter, since they pay more for each ACOG than they do for the M16's and M4's they put them on!

Manufacturer page for product:
http://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=TA31RCO-A4CP

From that site:

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gun sight (ACOG) designed for the M16A4 Weapon system (20” barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self- luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.



The TA31RCO-A4CP also includes:

Package Contains: 
•	Glock 17 Gen 4 9mm pistol
•	3 - 17 round magazines
•	Multiple back straps
•	Glock Case, manuals, lock, loader, cleaning brush/rod and safety information
•	Ghost Brand Extended Slide Release
•	Ghost Brand 3.5 lb Trigger Connector
•	I Love My Glock Brand Competition Spring Kit 
•	Tru Glo Tritium Night Sights
•	50 Rounds of Speer Law Enforcement Gold Dot 9mm 124 Grain Gold Dot Hollow Points

All Original Glock parts and springs are included in the sale.  If you choose to return the pistol to a stock configuration you will have all necessary parts and springs.  I am a certified Glock Armorer, I have cleaned the firearm and installed all parts.  The firearm is new and has never been fired outside the factory.  It has a date of manufacture of April 17, 2012. 

There are no wear marks and the gun is prestine. 

Terms: 
•	$540 for the package 

At this price point you are getting $150 of ammo, night sights, and spring kit basically for free and still don’t have to pay tax.   This is a great package at a great price; lower price offers will be properly ignored.   

•	Private Face to Face Sale 
•	Local Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area only meeting (Prefer South Metro - I will meet someone halfway)
•	Cash Sale  (I am able to take credit cards via Square.com and charge 2.75% processing fee)
•	No Trades
•	Oh and due to one of my last sales going a little weird.  Please do not try to offer a lower price when we meet.  That is not a place for negotiation.  This is perhaps one of the rudest things that I have experience.   The firearm package is as advertised and a extremely good deal.   If this happens, I will either increase my asking price or drive away.   
•	Bill of sale can be provided if buyer requests it.  
•	Just need to see permit to purchase/carry permit and valid driver’s license.

The factory 386 code is somewhat more desirable, supposedly being the Poly-Tech factory that made the Chinese military AK along side these. As the Chinese guns go, these are typically very nice. The Chinese AK is a well-made version. Solid weapon. Typical values are $550-$700, maybe a touch higher because or the factory codefactory.

Gun would not drop mags, so returned to CZ and they sent me a brand new gun last month-works great. Super accuracy and very smooth trigger. I recently bought a subcompact 9mm and want to move up to a .40 S&W for competition shooting, so the P07 is up for grabs. It's shot every type of ammo I've thrown at it and shoots tight groups. I can hit a metal target non-supported at 100yds 3 out of 4 times with it. The trigger is amazingly smooth. Holsters are hard to find and mags cost around $43 apiece, so you've got everything bundled in a great package. The gun came with two mags, so you've got three total."
