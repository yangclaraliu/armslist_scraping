So today I went to my local Gander Mountain store, and found this......

1. They were very busy with guys buying hand guns
2. The selling prices, in many cases, compared to advertised prices on Armslist, were less!!
3. My suggestions, based on my experience here are:
A. If your going to advertise, then answer the emails, even if you don't like it, it's just plain courtesy. Remember, people will treat you, the same way you treat them. Be nice, it's not hard to do.
B. get your prices in line. Yes I agree, our government is screwing with the second amendment, AGAIN! And people are lining up to grab while the grabbing is good. But be smart, YOUR AT LEAST THE SECOND OWNER, your gun is USED, price it accordingly, otherwise everyone will do what I did, go buy it NEW at a local dealer for the same price as yours, or in many cases, mine included, CHEAPER THAN ADVERTISED ON ARMSLIST!!"

You will look for a long time before you find one like it and in the condition it is in.

It also has a Ted Williams scope mount on it and a Bushnell Sportview 3x9x40 scope and also has original sling mounts and an older era matching sling. This rifle is in remarkable condition and has very little wear on it, the bluing is still in remarkable condition and is 90% or better. The wood on this gun is near perfect and the gun has not been refinished in any way. I've seen similar rifles sell for as much as $2,000 but I'm being realistic on my pricing. I'm asking $1,100 for it or would consider a partial trade for a Para Ordnance Night Hawg or Wart Hawg in .45acp plus $650 cash my way.

I am parting with my Mark I IMI Desert Eagle chambered in .357 Magnum. I have the factory 6"" barrel installed at the moment. I had a pair of matching .357 Eagles and have parted with one so far and I am looking to part with this last one. I have put about 100 rounds through this handgun, The pair of eagles I purchased consisted of one in near mint condition and one a little more used, I have preserved the nicer eagle (Item for sale) and shot the other majority of the time. One heads up on the ammo needed to action this weapon, with the action being so long to chamber another round it requires a very hot loaded .357 I have had great luck with Remington 125 Grain ammo as the minimum required to action the pistol, anything hotter is just fine, I have shot a few magazines of hollow point ammo to ensure that it would feed and load as expected and have had no issues. 

With the 14"" barrel I have reached out as far as 300 yards and dropped a round on the gong. These barrels were made in the 80s and are no longer produced and are getting harder and harder to find. I have attached a few pictures.

If you have any interest please feel free to contact me. I prefer E-mail to filter out the persons who are not interested but if you would like to call or text my number is 918-637-35one2

I am open to offers and fair trades. to be specific I am looking to purchase an FNH AR .308 but they are hard to get ahold of. I am looking to sell the gun with the barrel and magazines together I may sell the barrel separately but will not sell the gun without the barrel I have no use for a barrel with no weapon.

If you have have any decent offers to trade feel free to contact me. no garbage."

Do an internet search for the rave reviews this rifle received. Uses a new made-in-Bulgaria receiver manufactured by I.S.D.; a new original Bulgarian chrome-lined barrel; and new Bulgarian parts on a used Bulgarian stock set. The stock set is used—hence the name “Truck Gun”—but the rest of the parts are all new military-grade originals. Manufactured before the barrel import ban (and long before the current AWB proposals). 

This rifle is absolutely new—I have never fired a single shot through it. I bought it new from TGI when I planned to attend an AK class, but the class was never held, so I’ve never fired this rifle. I racked the bolt a few times (15?) and dry-fired a few times (15?). Surprisingly nice trigger—I don’t know a lot about AK’s but never previously suspected they were this smooth. 

When I bought the rifle I purchased eight additional Bulgarian 5.45x39mm magazines (a Pro-Mag came with it) for a total of nine magazines. 

Will sell rifle with 9 magazines--a complete ready-to-go package--for $1,399. Prefer not to split up rifle and magazines. Will ship to FFL or will meet for FTF sale in south-central Wisconsin (rifle buyer provides WI DL# or WI CCW license # and signs a receipt stating they're not prohibited from owning firearms). 

Will consider partial trades for excellent-plus condition Springfield Armory Range Officer or Colt 1911; Browning High Power; 3” K-frame .38 or .357; 'pre-Rem' Marlin 1894 in .357 or .44; Winchester or 'pre-Rem' Marlin .30-30; Marlin/Glenfield 60 ($100 max); Ruger 10/22 or Remington Nylon 66 ($200 max), or...????

It is a poncho style with hood and burlap tied on both front and back, made out of 1 in. square hand tied netting. Each piece of burlap is also hand tied to the netting. The colors used were dark green's and browns, but there is plenty of room on the netting to add in any additional colors you want. Just go to a fabric store and pick out what you want and add it in. It could even be cut in half, (back and front) and sewn to a pair of camo pants and shirt or flight suit or even a pair of unlined coveralls and you would have two sets. I used it for turkey and deer hunting (from the ground) and it worked wonderfully. Im trying to raise money for a muzzle brake for my .308.

Since that time a total of 30 rounds have been fired through the gun and it shoots great, no more accuracy problems. I have added a stainless steel Skinner peep sight to the rifle such as what is seen in the following link:

Has break-open action for easy removal of breech plug and cleaning.  I took good care of this rifle and it is in excellent condition.  It shoots very well using 2 Triple 7 pellets(100 grains), Federal 209 shotgun primer and a 295 grain Power Belt bullet.  I shoot groups less than 2.5 inches at 100 yards with this combo which is good enough for me for deer hunting.  I'm sure that experimentation with other powders and bullets could tighten the groups even more if desired.
Rifle is topped with a Cabela's Powder Horn 3-9x40 scope.  This is a nice sharp scope and I have been happy with it. Scope has duplex reticle with built-in bullet drop reticle.  Has long eye relief.  Box that scope came in an instructions included.
When the scope was mounted the rear sight was removed.  That will be included with this sale should you ever desire it. Sights are fiber optic.
Breech plug wrench is also included.
This is a very nice muzzle loader and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  I really like the CVA Optima and the only reason I am selling this one is because I want to buy the new updated one."

Great condition Beretta CX4 carbine in .40 S&W caliber with two 17 round magazines. Has had about 500 rounds through it total. The gun works great and is the most comfortable small carbine I have ever shot or owned. I would love to keep it but unfortunately my gun hobby has reached a point of being unaffordable and this baby has to go. 

I did have one minor issue with the gun concerning the safety transfer bar that prevents inadvertent discharge if the gun were to be dropped on the muzzle. On the inside of the gun is a tiny black metal tab that is held in place by the composite trigger group assembly and it interacts with this safety bar. During dissasembly this part broke off. I traced the overall problem back to the fact that the transfer bar itself is just a hair too big and needs to be filed down in order for this safety to work with out causing the same problem to happen again.

 PLEASE NOTE: this problem does not affect the ability of the gun to be fired at all, in fact this safety seems to be more of a novelty than anything but if purchased I am not responsible for any injury that occurs due to this issue. I have all of the parts including an extra Trigger group assembly (which costs over $200 by itself). Again, the gun fires abvsolutely fine and has no issues that would cause it to be unreliable, the breakage that occurred is unbelievably tiny and honestly is incredibly difficult to explain/show without actually talking over the phone or via face to face contact. If any additional clarification is needed please contact me."

Cash only. Firm on price as this is new and at dealer cost. 

The Dangerous Game® Machine Rifle Rest uses Nitrogen filled compression dampers to absorb the recoil. If the rifle rest is firmly anchored to a solid bench, the gun will return to battery after every shot. Since the compression damper absorbs the recoil, in a manner similar to your shoulder, there is no need to worry about damage to stock, bedding or recoil lugs. This is in sharp contrast to other products that require extensive realignment after each shot and offer more resistance that is manageable for the structure of the gun. Equipped with one light, one medium and one heavy, factory calibrated, compression damper. There is no equal for sighting in or load testing. By using the remote hydraulic trigger release, the rifle rest eliminates any human induced motion contamination. Achieve a tight group without the discomfort of recoil.

Attach bench platform to shooting bench with C clamps for solid shooting platform.

Smoothly handles everything from a .223 to a .416 Rigby, including .50 BMG."

Manufacturer: Colt Defense LLC
Caliber: 5.56x45 mm NATO (.223 Rem.)
Action Type: Gas-operated, semi-automatic center-fire rifle
Receiver: Upper and lower, forged 7075-T6 aluminum
Barrel: 16.1"", chrome-moly, button rifled, chrome lined
Rifling: Six-groove, 1:7"" right-hand twist
Magazine: 20- or 30-round box
Sights: Height-adjustable flip-up front post; rear sight adjustable for windage and elevation, with 0.069"" flip-up aperture; top, side and bottom Picatinny rails
Trigger: Single-stage, 7-lb., 4-oz. pull
Stock: Collapsible polymer: length of pull, 10"" to 13¼""; drop at heel, 1/2""; drop at comb, 1/2""
Overall Length: 351⁄4"" (buttstock extended), 32"" (buttstock folded)
Weight: 7 lbs., 1 oz.
Accessories: Two 20-round magazines, quick-detachable front sling swivel, nylon sling, cleaning kit


The upper, made from a CNC-machined 7075-T6 aluminum forging, features integral top and side Picatinny rails extending forward just to the rear of the gas block. Recesses for quick-detachable sling swivels are located on both side rails. The bottom rail is a separate piece that can be detached for cleaning or installation of under-barrel accessories. All rail sections have numbered slots for repeatable installation of devices. 

The LE6940 has extensive parts commonality with the M4, sharing the barrel’s chrome-lining, four-position collapsible stock, and birdcage-style flash hider. Also present are the familiar shell deflector, ejection port cover and forward assist. The LE6940’s bolt, carrier and trigger mechanism also follow the proven AR-15 pattern, as do the controls on the lower receiver: magazine release, reversible safety and bolt release. Like all current Colt-produced rifles, the LE6940 uses 0.154-inch-diameter hammer and trigger pins.

The 1:7-inch twist of the barrel and 5.56x45 mm NATO chamber allow the use of 55-grain, 62-grain and 77-grain ammunition. The M4-style barrel measures 0.750 inches at the gas block, but decreases to 0.640 inches under the handguard, and incorporates the M4-style step. Barrel attachment is by way of an improved barrel nut that reportedly offers greater strength.

Advanced combat bipod is designed specifically for the M16/M4 weapon families. Attached directly to the MIL-STD 1913 MWS (SOPMOD) rail system, no separate adapters necessary.

Bipod body - The clamp body and center portion are forged from 7075-T6 aluminum with Type III hard anodizing. The center portion has two pivots, to which the legs are attached. It will fit on any MIL-STD 1913 rail, using a clamp on the base that is secured by two stainless, black finish screws. An allen wrench or screwdriver can be used to install or remove the ACB. A black stainless button on the outside of each pivot releases and engages a sealed, pre-lubricated stainless steel locking mechanism, which allows the bipod legs to rotate 90° from stowed to deployed. It is locked in both positions and can only be released by puching the button. The center portion rotates for traversing and allows about 40° of angle. The whole bipod body can cant 15°. Urethane bushings keep the bipod center-favoured while allowing it to cant on uneven ground. 

Legs - The legs are made up of two pieces - the inner and outer legs. The outer legs house the locking mechanism and button, and have 3 holes/detents which provide 3 height adjustments. The outer legs are made of a proprietary glass-reinforced nylon and are much tougher than they look (I was concerned early on in the design stage when I saw the inner legs, but tried to snap one and I couldn't. The ACB-4 has exceeded Army drop-test requirements). The inner legs are made of carbon-fiber reinforced nylon, and slide in and out of the outer legs. At the top of the inner leg is a button, which fits into the detents in the outer legs. The inner legs are extended by simply pulling them out. In order to shorten them, the button must be depressed and the leg slid in, where the button will engage the next detent. The feet are large to prevent sinking in sand and aggressively checkered for a good grip. When stowed, the bipod legs are locked along the rail system, fitting neatly between the lower and side rails."

Includes gas tube, steel low-profile press-fit set screw gas block (barrel has set-screw divots for gas block alignment).

Requires barrel nut, gunsmith installation recommended. NFA-registered or Pistol lower required.

These barrels are $425 from AAC.  They are out of stock.  I dropped the price of this barrel because I scratch it a little with my aluminum vise blocks taking the flash hider off of it.  You can either have it re-blacked or not worry about it since your rail will cover it anyway."

Some things to keep in mind when you’re looking for options:

1.  The advantages of this rifle with the upcoming legislation is that the rifle incorporates a stripper clip guide for easily loading rounds from inexpensive stripper clips without the purchase of expensive magazines.

2.  The rifle has a synthetic stock which is stronger and less susceptible to damage in the field while reducing the weight of the standard walnut stocks by almost a pound.  At less than 9lbs this is one of the lighter semi-auto full length military type rifles ever to have seen battle.  

3.  These rifles have been around for over 50 years and are loved by the master rifleman and the USMC.  A multitude of stocks, sights, and other parts are available and there is a lot of expertise available to support these rifles both online and at various clubs in the local area.
