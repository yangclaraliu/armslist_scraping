Title sort of says it all. I am the proud owner of a vintage ruger 10/22 that i absolutely LOVE. 
Only problem is that i inherited it from my grandmother (you heard me). And it has some strong sentimental value. This being the case i can't go and slap a bunch of aftermarket shit on it and destroy such a piece of family history.
That being said id love to get another .22 with an adjustable stock (I'm a great deal taller than my grandmother) cool sights and maybe a decent scope for some run n gunnin with my friends.
Anyway like i said i love the ruger but id also consider the gsg5 the mossberg version I'm pretty sure remington has a mag fed .22. you get the idea.
My budget isn't huge but let me know what ya got.
Ive got some .45 cap ammo I might be willing to trade along with cash.

Number match. Includes holster, 2 magazines and cleaning tool. The blue finish show some light holster wear. The bore is nice and clean. The 9mm makarov ammo is inexpensive.

Has been modified with Wolff springs to reduce recoil, double action pull and mag release force. Recoil and double action pull are the two main complaints about this gun. A stronger recoil spring makes it much more comfortable to shoot. a weaker hammer spring reduces the force required for the double action pull and makes it much easier to release the magazine.

The small size and single stack mag makes this a very nice gun for concealed carry. Fits easily in a pocket and there are various holsters available.

This rifle is one of the infamous ""non-rusty"" CMP heavy barrel target rifles that have been sold out for nearly a year, and ALL are now in private hands.  This rifle was hand picked with beautiful wood and NO RAZOR CUT!  

Originally build for an Army contract to field 20,000 rifles for its ROTC/JROTC 3-position shooting teams.  The rifles were delivered by KoO shortly before the EPA closed down the indoor ranges.  After the closing of the ranges, the program died, and the rifles stored in Army warehouses until the recent transfer to the CMP, and sales to members.  

I bought the rifle for mini-palma competition, but ended up with a nice 40xb heavy barrel instead.  Because of this, it has been sitting in the back of my humidity/climate controlled safe for a long while.  Never shot, and looking for a new home.  These rifles are capable of ragged hole groups at 50yrds, and a friend regularly shoots a 6""x2"" spinner target at 200yrds with subsonic match ammo.  

The single shot rifle weighs nearly 10lbs, and its barrel is .980"" at the muzzle.  This is no rifle for humping through the woods hunting bunnies, but with its inherent accuracy, you can just set up a bench at the road and only walk to get the game!  

The rifle will include everything shipped originally;

Diopter sights with all inserts
hand stop for stock rail
3x stock (LOP) extender plates
2x Allen wrenches
OEM shot card
Owner's manual
Original CMP box
CMP certificate of authenticity

I would like to do a F2F sale with someone in the TC metro area.  Please have a VALID state issued ID AND valid permit to purchase/carry.  I am also willing to ship to anywhere in the lower 48 to your FFL.  This rifle IS NOT C&R, so it must go to a FFL-01 dealer for transfer.

I am thinking about selling my AK-47 made by Inter-Ordnance. The model is: I.O. Inc. 10K-47C. This rifle is NOT a WASR, not by a million miles. This thing was quality built, I compared it to a WASR that I bought new (and got rid of because it wasn't up to par with this one). This rifle was 100% American built, not some cheap thrown together rifle. The rifle was made in 2008, I confirmed it by calling the manufacturer and looking up my serial number. The gun was recently DuraCoated in the color of Parker. Because this is a quality AK-47 variant, and I know the pricing this thing was originally priced at, I will not let this go for under $700. So if you are going to try and offer $699 or below, don't bother wasting our time.

The rifle will come with the following:

- 1 Brand-New, never used TapCo magazine (in plastic still)
- TapCo infusion hand guard with a tri-rail system and heat shield (top one screws on but I took it off for a better iron sight picture.)
- TapCo AK-47 style buttstock with metal buttplate.
- Un-installed scope mount bracket.
- Two 30 round magazines (steel)

***MAGPUL FORWARD ANGLE GRIP WILL NOT BE INCLUDED.

Asking for $700 for all of this. If you look up the price of the rifle as well as all of the stuff included, you'll see it's valued a few hundred less.

I can send pictures of the rest of the stuff, but if you look it up, it's going to be the same as in those pictures. I WILL NOT TRAVEL MORE THAN 20 minutes from Fayetteville and I will NOT accept a bullshit offer. Thanks for your interest."

This is an excellent shooting classic lever action rifle. Was stored in a basement for several years and the outside metal became pitted. It was taken in and professionally cleaned and the entire exterior was blued. The inside never had a problem and looks great but had the shop clean and lubricate all parts to make sure everything was perfect. The rusting is completely taken care of but the finish is not perfect. Includes the original sling studs and the sling will be included. The work described above was completed 5 years ago and the gun has been used multiple times each year. It functions perfectly and eats through any .22 ammo you put into it. This has the factory scope mount from Marlin already on and this 1958 model does not have a safety. I will also include the Weaver style double strap scope rings in case you want to mount a scope.

For sale is a Ruger .380 LCP dealer addition which has the beautiful scroling work. I bought this new for my wife, but she prefers her revolver so thus the sale. It's been to the range twice and has fired 100 200 rounds. What I really like about this pistol is that I can put it in the pocket of my gym shorts and they don't tug or want to fall down. Amazing! Here's a couple of links to review;

I am thinking about selling my AK-47 made by Inter-Ordnance. The model is: I.O. Inc. 10K-47C. This rifle is NOT a WASR, not by a million miles. This thing was quality built, I compared it to a WASR that I bought new (and got rid of because it wasn't up to par with this one). This rifle was 100% American built, not some cheap thrown together rifle. The rifle was made in 2008, I confirmed it by calling the manufacturer and looking up my serial number. The gun was recently DuraCoated in the color of Parker. Because this is a quality AK-47 variant, and I know the pricing this thing was originally priced at, I will not let this go for under $700. So if you are going to try and offer $699 or below, don't bother wasting our time.

The rifle will come with the following:

- 1 Brand-New, never used TapCo magazine (in plastic still)
- TapCo infusion hand guard with a tri-rail system and heat shield (top one screws on but I took it off for a better iron sight picture.)
- TapCo AK-47 style buttstock with metal buttplate.
- Un-installed scope mount bracket.
- Two 30 round magazines (steel)

***MAGPUL FORWARD ANGLE GRIP WILL NOT BE INCLUDED.

Asking for $700 for all of this. If you look up the price of the rifle as well as all of the stuff included, you'll see it's valued a few hundred less.

I can send pictures of the rest of the stuff, but if you look it up, it's going to be the same as in those pictures. I WILL NOT TRAVEL MORE THAN 20 minutes from Fayetteville and I will NOT accept a bullshit offer. Thanks for your interest."

Two Bulgarian Arsenal SLR-95 AK-47 rifles. The receivers are milled and they have Steyr chrome lined barrels. These rifles were fully assembled in Bulgaria and were imported into the United States during the mid 1990s. 


One is in stock factory configuration with no modifications made ever. This rifle has 10 boxes of Wolf black box thru it. 

The second one has been modified with an ACE folding stock setup. Stock installed as per ACE's instructions.At one time this rifle had a KREBS rail system which is long gone so there may be some marks under the handguards. This rifle has around 600 rounds of Wolf black box thru it. 


Both rifles are shooter grade weapons. They are not new in box. Both function flawless as is to be expected from Arsenal weapons. Both have extremely smooth actions and nice triggers. 

Included with the 2 rifles is the original thumbhole stock from the modified rifle and also a fixed rear black stock that can go on the other rifle if you have a pistol grip. I can include a cracked grip and 100% condition pistol grip screw from a WASR if the buyer wants it. The sling pictured is also included. There wil be 2 Euro or Chinese mags included- used. 


Included with sale is the following ammunition which will be shipped direct to the buyer along with the other stocks:

The whole package includes a Sig Sauer P226 classic beavertail with both .22LR slide barrel that has adjustable sights and a .40 slide/barrel that has Siglite night sights.  

It also comes with two 10 round .22 mags, a 10 and 15 round .40 mag. Cases for both gun and extra slide/barrel. Cleaning tool, sight adjusting tools, all original paperwork, and cable lock.

I'm also throwing in a paddle holster and 20 round box of Hornaday Critical Defense.

Keep ready as a .40 or .22 and switch whenever the mood hits you as it takes less than 10 seconds to change! Fires great with either caliber. Great for plinking around for CHEAP with the .22 while getting the feel of your full size 226

I have for sale a genuine luminous disc issued to NCO's and officers of the 101st airborne on D-Day. If you are reading this, it is still available.

It was supposed to aid in re-grouping at night as it used to glow in the dark. It is a must for re-enactors that want an authentic uniform and gear loadout. The phoshorus compund has worn out, but the Radium component is still very radioactive.

This is NOT a relic grade piece dug up in a field like 90% you see. It is all original with 80% of the original blueing still in tact. Some poor guy carried this through the whole war and eventually ended up back here in the U.S.

It is a U.S. issue type two which can be either clipped onto your clothing or helmet webbing with the rivetted on clip, or tied on by means of two holes. It is marked POISON INSIDE. This is the rarest of all PERSONAL luminous disc markers and it is valued in the $750 range at auction.

Comes in a custom locking yellow shielded .50 cal ammo can with proper transport markings. It is perfectly safe and legal to own. It is also the single most radioactive thing in the world you can buy without a license, thus the shielded can.

I understand to the buyer they are just new old toys, but to the seller, they are memories and the fact he is selling is a bit traumatic. I understand that and am honoring his request to me that they go where they will be appreciated.

Here's the last two:

Winchester M12, 12 gauge, 1955. Cutts Compensator installed at the time - 1955. Includes a Lyman 725 choke, and a Cutts-Lyman Adjustable choke. Lots of birds taken with this gun. Roughly 60% finish. REDUCED to $375

S&W M&P .38 Special. 4"" barrel. Grips numbered to butt, barrel, serial # and cylinder; appears quite righteous, all matching and correct. 1946-54 vintage. I'd grade the finish at 95%; some thinning on highspots, muzzle but nothing serious or detracting. Reduced to $600

I have no boxes for any of these.

I am happy to entertain respectful offers. You can't insult me as these are not mine, but opportunistic, greedy and unfair offers will do you no favors. I am doing this without compensation to me, just as a favor, and I don't need silly offers or for you to jerk me around.

No felons, crooks, wifebeaters or illegal aliens. If you say ""I'll take it"" and then don't show up, I will post your cell number and email address so other sellers will see it.

 Im setting the first price at $1,000 OBO, like I said below I'm willing to go a bit below $1,050. So $1,000 OBO is just a set price, I'm definitely negotiable on the price!

 As far as I know, Sig has stopped making this model of the Sig P226, so its pretty tough to find them, let alone a new one. Most of these I've seen out their are the .40 cal, not the .9mm.

 Im looking to sell it straight up, cash only, in person deals only. Must be from Ohio and have a Ohio Drivers License, and you will be signing a bill of sale.

 Dealers sell these for around $1,050 new, I'm willing to go less than that! These are PHENOMAL Carry guns, it doesn't get much better then this! Id say that is why Special Forces use the Standard P226, so this Platinum Elite is just exceptional. Talking about it on here does it no justice, in person is absolutely  amazing.

 Im in Cincinnati and I'm willing to drive a little bit to do the deal, but I rather you come to me if possible.

 I have pictures on my cell phone right now, so text me for some pictures. Im going to get some pictures up on here shortly!

First off I must say this firearm has been great to me I carried it daily for over a year it has never let me down is a great shooter and is in overall great condition for a carry gun. So you may wonder what makes this gun so rare. well there are many first gen 247s out there it is fairly common for the full frame versions to have a built in decocking system it is far more uncommon for the compact versions to have such a feature this will allow you to decock it after loading a round in the chamber there for carrying it with a double action trigger for more peace of mind. very limited versions they put a titanium slide on the 247 now what makes this firearm rare is that it is the compact version with a titanium slide and decocker system. so what you have is a striker fired pistol capable of being decocked  in the compact lighter version with the titanium slide. Acording to taurus it looks like 2009 was the only year they made this guy with those 3 combinations in a very limited run of numbers. go ahead look for yourself will be very hard hard to find 1. in all the time I've had this gun I've only seen 1 with titanium and ds but it was a full frame. I know some people don't care for Taurus but i often carried this over my ruger sr9 or xd40sc I trust my life with this gun. comes with 1 13rd and 1 17rd magazines hardcase and manual. 350 firm. check out what other strikers fired pistols with decockers sell for p99s sw99s.

I am selling both my hunting rifle and my shotgun to finance a project that I have wanted to put together for a long time. Included in the package is as follows:

-Excellent condition NEVER FIRED Ruger M77 Hawkeye chambered in .308. This rifle features a walnut stock, 22"" barrel, Ruger scope rings, 4+1 integral magazine, box, manual, lock. 

-Excellent condition Remington Wingmaster 12 gauge shotgun. This shotgun has less than 50 rounds through it and looks like it could be new. It was made in 2006 so it is not 'old' by any means. It has the beautiful deep blueing and real american walnut furniture. Comes with a plastic Plano hardcase.

-Leupold VX-1 3-9x40mm rifle scope. This scope is as new in the box and has never been taken out into the field. It comes with box, scope, lifetime warranty, and manual. 

-Butler creek scope covers. These are the quick release flip covers for the Leupold scope. 

-100 rounds of factory FEDERAL 150-grain soft tip .308. Brand new factory ammunition in the box. 5 boxes of 20 rounds.

-50 rounds of factory FEDERAL 7 1/2 shot 12 gauge shotgun shells. 2 boxes of 25 shells.

-10 rounds of factory WINCHESTER 1 oz rifle slugs. 2 boxes of 5 slugs each.

I am not interested in separating the guns or ammo. I will sell the entire package without the scope for $1150. I am not interested in selling the scope by itself. Lowball offers will be IGNORED. I want the money for a new project but it is not a feast or famine situation. I am hoping somebody who likes to hunt will take these off my hands and we can both walk away happy.  Price is fair. Face to face in Colorado springs area preferred, must be legal to own a long gun in Colorado. Contact me with any questions, thanks for looking."

I am selling both my hunting rifle and my shotgun to finance a project that I have wanted to put together for a long time. Included in the package is as follows:

-Excellent condition NEVER FIRED Ruger M77 Hawkeye chambered in .308. This rifle features a walnut stock, 22"" barrel, Ruger scope rings, 4+1 integral magazine, box, manual, lock. 

-Excellent condition Remington Wingmaster 12 gauge shotgun. This shotgun has less than 50 rounds through it and looks like it could be new. It was made in 2006 so it is not 'old' by any means. It has the beautiful deep blueing and real american walnut furniture. Comes with a plastic Plano hardcase.

-Leupold VX-1 3-9x40mm rifle scope. This scope is as new in the box and has never been taken out into the field. It comes with box, scope, lifetime warranty, and manual. 

-Butler creek scope covers. These are the quick release flip covers for the Leupold scope. 

-100 rounds of factory FEDERAL 150-grain soft tip .308. Brand new factory ammunition in the box. 5 boxes of 20 rounds.

-50 rounds of factory FEDERAL 7 1/2 shot 12 gauge shotgun shells. 2 boxes of 25 shells.

-10 rounds of factory WINCHESTER 1 oz rifle slugs. 2 boxes of 5 slugs each.

I am not interested in separating the guns or ammo. I will sell the entire package without the scope for $1150. I am not interested in selling the scope by itself. Lowball offers will be IGNORED. I want the money for a new project but it is not a feast or famine situation. I am hoping somebody who likes to hunt will take these off my hands and we can both walk away happy.  Price is fair. Face to face in Colorado springs area preferred, must be legal to own a long gun in Colorado. Contact me with any questions, thanks for looking."
