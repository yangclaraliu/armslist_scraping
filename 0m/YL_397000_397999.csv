I believe it is considered a 3 screw model.   The 2012 Blue Book of Gun Values say this gun between $600 - $700.   The experts say:  All -1 models have a 4-screw frame EXCEPT for the Model 29-1 where all but one reported (S220004) have a 3-screw frame and an extractor rod with a right-hand (old style) thread. In reality, only S220004 is a true Model 29-1. The other ones are stamped 29-1 in the yoke cut, but are not configured correctly.

Based on what I have observed over the years, the -1 model variation would best be described: 4-screw frame, extractor rod with a left-hand thread as evidenced by a small relief cut behind the knurled tip, ""L"" stamped on the rear surface of the cylinder, stamped MOD.XX-1 in the yoke cut.

I am only talking about models of revolvers that were stamped -1 when the extractor rod threads were changed from right-hand to left-hand as directed by the engineering change dated December 22, 1959. 


The engineering change to implement the extractor rod with the left-hand thread was issued by S&W on December 22, 1959 and resulted in revolvers with the -1 model variation. The engineering change to implement the improved cylinder stop with the elimination of the cylinder stop plunger screw was issued on November 28, 1961 and resulted in revolvers with the -2 model variation. The time it took to implement these changes was substantial as the -1 models were shipped throughout 1962 and the -2 models began in late 1962.

The change to the extractor rod with a left-hand thread was authorized in late 1959, but -1 models did not begin to be shipped until 1962 and most were shipped in that year with a few carrying over to 1963. The -2 models also appeared in late 1962, so the the -1s were really only shipped for a year plus.

The engineering directive to change the thread direction on the extractor rod (RH to LH) was issued on December 22, 1959 and took approximately two years to implement (based on what we know today...and it may change when more revolvers are discovered and documented). The engineering directive to implement the improved cylinder stop that resulted in the elimination of the cylinder stop plunger screw (i.e. 4-screw frame to 3-screw frame) was issued on November 28, 1961 and was implemented much more quickly as revolvers with a 3-screw frame began to be shipped in early 1962. That is why (some believe) Model 29-1s have a 3-screw frame as S&W had old style extractor rods and cylinders, but had made the switch to the 3-screw frame and used up the old cylinders and extractor rods on the ""new"" frames. I am not sure why these guns were actually stamped MOD. 29-1 in the yoke cut, but they were."

It features the popular Top Gun modulator, which is like the SP1-A speech processor. The real advantage to the speech processor is that it will increase your average power, meaning overall youâ€™ll be putting out more wattage than similar radio.

It is really fun to shoot but I am trying to raise cash for something pretty expensive so I have to get rid of some stuff.

I am a registered 03 FFL and CWP holder.

Oh, this rifle has an upgraded spring loaded firing pin vs the free floating firing pin that came in all but the very early SKS rifles. It has also had the bolt modified to be like the Chinese SKS-M ""drop free"" so a magazine could be inserted into the gun without the need for the bolt to be open. 

The rifle on top is a standard size Yugo SKS for size comparison:"

The bore is extremely nice, and the rifle is ready to go hunting as it is.  It came to me with an M1 Garand sling, circa 1950's, and that sling comes with the rifle.

Burris SpeedBead Red Dot reflex Sight
     Burris SpeedBead Red Dot Reflex Sight Remington 870 12 Gauge Product Info The Burris SpeedBead Red Dot Reflex Sight features an essential SpeedBead System that is able to handle many factors that make wing shooters miss when out in the field. With the Burris Red Dot Sight's SpeedBead System, both the target and the red dot remain in focus, while the optics and their position on the sight plane eliminate the need for perfect left/right, up/down head position for an accurate shot. The innovative mount on this Red Dot Sight by Burris puts the center of the optic directly in line with the ventilated rib, so altering you current shooting style is not necessary. There is also 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 inches of eye relief provided on the SpeedBead Red Dot Reflex Sight by Burris, so there is no worry about your eyebrow running into the sight or even any interference with the hand gripping the shotgun. If the five year CR-2032 battery ever fails, it is possible to change to the front bead without visual interference.

DUE TO THE NUMEROUS RESPONSES WITH OFFERS AND THEN NO FURTHER COMMUNICATION; 

Please, only serious buyers/people with offers respond.  If you are not serious about a transaction, please don't waste another man's time, or your own with asking what the cash price is and saying ""I'll take it"" and then not responding to further emails, or offering a trade and then not following through.  That's not cool.  If you're grown up enough to own a weapon, then you're grown up enough to follow through or not bother in the first place.  I know I'm not the only one that has dealt with this, so, sorry to gripe so much, but, it needs to be said. 


Also have about 650 rounds, 400 of which are on stripper clips and ready to go.  200 of those are in a Chinese chest rig bandolier.  Can throw in some or all for the right weapon and CAN ADD CASH that you might specify.

If you ever wanted to try it, or you'd just like to add some new toys, here's everything you need to shoot black powder.

Traditions Mountaineer .50 - Here is a really nice Spanish made Traditions .50 cal muzzle Loader with a 27"" Octagon rifled barrel. The bore is bright with strong rifling and the gun looks to have been shot little. The gun has a few marks on it from use but other than that the gun is in really nice shape as you can see. Nice open sights and a light crisp trigger release.

Lyman Great Plains Pistol .50 - ""Lyman's Plains Pistol recreates the trapper's percussion pistol of the mid-1800's while incorporating the best of modern steels and technology. The richly stained walnut stock complements blackened iron furniture, polished brass trigger guard and ramrod tips. The hooked patent breech takes down quickly and easily for cleaning. The thimble is recessed into the rib and a detachable belt hook provides an alternative to a holster. A spring-loaded trigger and 7½"" barrel with a fast 1 in 30"" twist make it amazingly accurate.""

Pietta 1860 Army .44 revolver + holster - The 1860 Army revolver was adopted by the U.S. Ordnance and became very popular with mounted troops because of its easy handling, superior balance and excellent ballistics. This authentic reproduction is 44 Caliber with a round barrel, brass trigger guard, 6-shot cylinder, fixed sights and one-piece walnut grip. Includes a nice leather holster.

Its literally made to have two cables plugged into it that go to a selector box so you can jump from acoustic to electric with the tap of a button. You can also mix the acoustic and electric tones to make a unique hybrid sound. There is a seperate control panel on the back for the Nanomag and it takes a 9v battery like a normal acoustic/electric guitar. This guitar is exactly as new. Not a chip or scratch anywhere, its the best guitar I have ever owned and I treat it very well. I usually keep it in my case except for special gatherings when I play it or just show it. 

I would like to trade for an AR-15 or something of the like. Doesn't have to be ultra high eng mil spec Remington or Bushmaster, just something that functions well and can take down a coyote. I have maybe up to $400 to add to the deal, depending on rifle.

The Mini Draco is in a class of it's own and so I am not going say allot about it because if your looking at it your probably already know.  Near the top of the list of my all-time favorite weapons! 

Probably Collectible?  There is no doubt that this is a collectable weapon for a variety of reasons and will continue skyrocket in price.  This receiver has the ""Y"" ""X"" ""I"" stamp as well the magazine ""Dimples"" are correct deep sided just like all true Soviet style AK's have.  Obviously this weapon is made with Russian tooling specs, not like all American receivers which have non-standard low slope sidewall magazine dimples and are missing auto sear stamps ""Y"" ""I"" .  Also note that this AK is classified as a pistol and provides more compact firepower than any handgun I can think of.

For 950.00 or best offer I am selling is an all black 5.56 NATO Mid length M4 with a 16-inch barrel, palmetto state armory upper and PSA bolt assembly. Fitted with a Magpul Mid Length hand guard. The sights; a standard A-1 iron front and a LMT rear sight. On the barrel an A2 birdcage flash suppressor.

The lower is an MGO commissioned piece made by Mega Arms. Its stamped 1 of 100 made of this particular part. It is fitted with an MOE grip, a Magpul Ambidextrous Sling Attachment Point and also a 6 position MOE Magpul collapsible stock.

Everything is milspec

2 mags one is a Magpul 30 round P Mag with window and dust cover. The other is a tango down polymer 30 round mag.

Additional Items included is a colt carrying handle with a scope mount rail. In the photo you will see a scope already on it. Its a no namer but it is included anyway. I can put in a little less than a 100 rounds of ammo on top of everything.

I piece this rifle together in a years time and now it is unfortunate that I have to sell it. Only 40 rounds exactly have been put through it to make sure it cycles smoothly and it definitely has done so. Every few weeks I re-oil the rifle. It is clear there is very little wear on the rifle and that is only due to cycling the bolt manually after oiling. This rifle was really cared for by me and saying that you will really have a quality firearm. It's mint condition.

Here are some photos: http://imgur.com/a/z10c8#0

I am interested in trading with cash for a gen 4 glock 23 or 19

The Smith & Wesson Model 13 (Military & Police Magnum) is a .357 Magnum revolver designed for military and police use. It is based on S&W's K-frame platform—specifically, it is a .357 Magnum version of the heavy-barrel variant of the .38 Special Model 10 (originally called the Military & Police).This is a double action revolver with a capacity of six rounds. Barrel length is 4"" with fixed sights. K-frame double action.  Also shoots .38.  This gun is nickel plated which adds $20 to the price, I didn't add that.  The price is directly out of the Blue Book.

My dad gave me this gun and said he did not believe it had ever been fired, I have not fired it and dad traded guns for years; so I believe the information is valid."

Nothing contained in this advertisement constitutes legal advice and no attorney-client relationship is intended or implied.
_____________________________________________________________

The National Firearms Act (“NFA”) has special requirements for the ownership of Title II firearms, which include machine guns, sound suppressors, short-barreled shotguns, short-barreled rifles, destructive devices, and “any other weapon”.  There are different options available to those interested in purchasing a Title II firearm, including purchasing as an individual or through a trust or business entity such as a corporation or limited liability company.

The most beneficial of the foregoing options is an NFA Gun Trust.  An NFA Gun Trust is a legal instrument that provides Title II firearms collectors with certain estate planning benefits while also setting forth who will use, possess and maintain the firearms and for whose benefit they will be so maintained.  Gun Trusts have many benefits beyond those offered by other ownership options, including:

•	No fingerprint cards or photo identification required
•	Chief Law Enforcement Officer (CLEO) signature is not required
•	Continuity of ownership upon incapacitation or death

Action & Fun

Whether you are looking for a pistol for affordable training or simply the excitement of shooting, the P22 is the pistol for you. The WALTHER P22 is fascinating in its compact size, while still maintaining all of the features of a full-size pistol.

Features of the P22

    Interchangeable frame back straps create an ideal fit to the shooter's hand
    Compact design and light-weight are achieved by a modern polymer frame (just 480 grams, including the magazine)
    Traditional double-action operation
    Ambidextrous controls for both left and right hand shooters
    Magazine disconnect, hammer safety and firing pin safety for safe and reliable operation
    Modern, eye catching high tech design
    Fixed barrel for incredible accuracy
    Windage adjustable rear sight and elevation adjustment with interchangeable front sights for variations in shooter operation
    Interchangeable barrel (sold separately) can convert the P22 from the standard configuration to the target version in minutes

Scope has been SPF. Rifle with mags and ammo still available for $900 even. Burris PEPR is available separately. 

This rifle was purchased 2 years ago and has been babied, loved and broken in with 20 round increments to 100 rounds. Also means that this was made in Bushmaster's Windham, ME plant before everything was moved to NY, though it is stamped for Rem Arms in Illion, NY. Everything in PERFECT shape. Round count estimated at 600-700 max chasing prairie dogs and coyotes. Have a couple student loans (undergrad & master) knocking on the door in a big way PLUS an expensive speeding ticket and car repairs I need to get serious about. Just thinking about selling this rifle makes me sick to my stomach but a benefit of owning guns to start with. It's by far the most accurate and rock solid AR/Hunting AR I've owned with ZERO failures in a maximum of 600-700 rounds through the pipe.

Pics are below, but as supplemental info here is a link to my full review of this rifle on Haus of Guns. I also show accuracy results which are routine with this rifle running 50 grain Vmax rounds from HSM out of Stevensville, MT.

By ""Package"" I'm referring to the Remington R-15 VTR .223 itself, 1"" Burris PEPR mount, the Nikon Coyote Special 4.5-14x optic, OD Green Ergo Grip and 2 OD 20 round Magpul Pmags. Total cost I'm asking for the package is $1200. I think I've got about 100 maybe more of the .223 mentioned above I can toss in too. 

Prefer to keep it as a package but will consider splitting up components (Nikon Coyote, Burris Pepr, Rifle only, Pmags), we can talk about individual prices if you're interested. Prefer not to sell others until rifle itself is sold. Face to face in Colorado is ideal, but I can ship to your FFL only. Shipping will be USPS and on buyer's dime, cash only deal.

Original cost of this package two years ago (before tax) was: $1200 for the rifle, $350 for the scope, $100 for the mount, $30 for the Ergo, $30 for 2 Pmags for a total of $1710 before tax. Even though a good bit of the feedback post 11/6/11 was lost, you'll find all previous feedback to be A+. Sorry for being so wordy, wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything. I've got the original box for the Coyote scope and the original matching camo grip for the R-15 if you're not a fan of the Ergo."

The SU-22 rifle is chambered for the popular and economical .22 Long Rifle cartridge (.22LR). It is based on the 5.56mm NATO chambered SU-16 rifle and shares many parts including the grip and front and rear sights. The SU-22 is not a simple conversion kit, it is a standalone firearm chambered for the .22LR and is designed for target shooting, plinking, or small game hunting. The PLR-22 and SU-22 operate by blowback action and have a 4140 steel bolt that rides on steel guide rails inside the polymer receiver. The ejector is attached to one of the guide rails and the recoil spring is located above the barrel. The cross-bolt safety and magazine release operate identically to the PLR-16 and SU-16.

Hi,
 This is an SKS with spike bayonet. It has the Tapco T6 system, LER scope, Williams rear peep sight front fire sight, five 30 round magazines along with all the original, numbers matching(bolt, receiver, receiver cover and stock) parts. I added the T6 because I'm a big guy and the original stock, while in great shape, was a little too short for me to shoot comfortably. I've got about $750 in it and will be looking for $600 trade value or $650 cash. If you're asking full retail value for yours, I'll expect full retail value for mine. Let's be reasonable ;-) Any additional pictures needed, just ask. Thanks!
