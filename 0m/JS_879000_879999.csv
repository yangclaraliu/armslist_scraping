The box is in nice shape and has the manual and take down tool. The gun comes with a total of four (4) HK magazines. I ordered 2 additional new ones and of the two I received they are new but one is mint and the other has a slight mark on the magazine from contact with something. The gun itself is excellent to like new. There is one small / slight mark on the right side of the slide from something in the box.
The slide is marked on the right side as Arlington , Va imported.

No pics, it's just a short and skinny AK-47 magazine. Black, heavy, steel, you know... an AK mag.
No rust, no dents, minimal use... there is light marking on the outside from being inserted into a rifle, and very minimal marking on the follower from being loaded and cycled/used. The follower is still black. The spring inside is rust free and still had a little oil on it from when new. 
I would describe it as nearly new. Considering the quality of the Romanian WASR-10 rifles, maybe ""new"" would be more accurate to describe the condition of this mag :)

It is a Romanian mag. I'm guessing out of one of the Romanian WASR-10 AK type rifles sold during the 1994-2004 era that was not capable of accepting the evil 'eye-salt' weapon standard double-stack AK mag.

Glock has said that the USA made Glocks (17, 26 and 27) are made for export only to countries that dont have a trade agreement with Austria and these models are NOT to be sold in the USA. Glock has also changed the finish on these slides, they are not Tenifer. They are Melanite QPQ as Tenifer uses a cyanide base in the manufacturing process and is outlawed by the EPA. Therefore the slide finish is more of a dark matte grey than the standard ""shiney"" finish. Also, the chambering is on the top if the barrel, not on the ejection port side. The ejector has also been improved and tuned on these models. I am not going to list a price but instead will listen to all offers and the first offer I like will get it.

Gives Operator A Major Tactical Advantage With 180 Degrees Of Unrestricted Sling Movement

Ambidextrous Sling Attachment Point helps the operator adapt quickly to changing tactical situations by allowing rapid switching of weapon from one shoulder to the other. An unrestricted 180° of sling movement lets you change shoulders to take maximum advantage of available cover, address targets around corners or other barriers, or shift weapon position if one arm is injured. Works with any single-point sling that attaches with a quick-release snap-hook, and fits any rifle or carbine with an M4-type collapsible buttstock. Simply remove the factory receiver end plate and replace with the ASAP; requires no other alterations to weapon, so you can continue to use your original receiver extension, buttstock, and sling. Heavy duty cast steel construction with a 1/8"" thick link ring, protected by a durable, wear- and corrosion-resistant mil-spec black manganese phosphate Parkerized finish. Fits both Commercial and Mil-Spec receiver extensions."

Back in the heyday of the TV Western, Steve McQueen, the star of ""Wanted: Dead or Alive,"" rode across black-and-white screens toting a sidearm like nothing any lawman or outlaw had carried before. A cut-down, modified version of repeating rifle, this recognizable shootin’ iron could be holstered like a pistol but fired with the speed of lever-action rifle. Nicknamed the Mare’s Leg, this innovative weapon swiftly brought outlaws to justice every week and rose to fame as the real star of the short-lived show. Now fans of those classic Westerns and collectors of innovative firearms can holster a replica of that famous made-for-TV sidearm.
Built in the USA, to Henry’s world-renowned standards of quality, the Mare’s Leg is available in your choice of .45 COLT or in .22 S/L/LR

The Henry Mare’s Leg .45 Colt is a modified variation of the Henry model H006C Big Boy .45 Colt. The Henry Mare’s Leg .22 S/L/LR a modified variation of the model H001 Henry Lever Action.

Like all Henry Rifles, each sports a select, handcrafted American Walnut stock cut to the exact specification of the gun used on the television series. The large loop lever, coupled with the legendary crisp Henry action, makes it easy for you to enjoy those rapid-fire repeating shots Steve McQueen used to take down the bad guys.

Each is equipped with a saddle ring.

Both calibers are equipped with an easy-loading tubular magazine design."

For example from a cold start I can turn on the computer and be logged into Windows 7 and surfing the internet in approx. 15 - 20 seconds. This computer and extras below is valued at around $2600!!!

I'm debating on selling/trading my CZ 75 SP-01 Tactical 9mm for the right offer. Has a rail and very nice night sights. Comes with two 18 round magazines, box, paperwork, lock. Has about 200 flawless rounds through it. I'm not entirely sure I want to get rid of it, but I figured I'd throw it out there to see what happens. Bought it brand new about a month ago. In brand new condition!

I'm really looking for a 1911. Colt, springfield, S&W, Sig Sauer, Ruger, ect ect.. Not interested in anything else. Only want a 1911 at the moment.

Bill of sale will be required upon purchase/trade. Valid FL drivers license required. Concealed Weapons License take priority.

Great for Cowboy action shooting or general home defense. Short and manuverable. Black Maple stock. Beautiful condition

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will interest all different collectors and shooters.

Sales Order: 

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not interested in Shipping a gun anywhere but ike all things, If I get enough ridiculous offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

Disclaimers and Information:

I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you are a litttle retarded and shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it. 

P.S. 

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, ha."

 Wood High Gloss finish, 22"" bbl, Bushnell Scope chief VI w/ Millet see through through High Mount steel rings, Cloth Sling , and soft case or hard case. Beautiful gun with a beautiful finish. I could sweeten the deal with some ammo depending if you came to me or not.

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It 
has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. 

Look at my other ads also. I will be selling the bulk of my collection over the next 
month or so to fund a large project. I will have some things for sale that will 
interest all different collectors and shooters.

 Sales Order: 

If the ad is up and I do not list it as ""sale pending"" then it is still for sale. Do 
not message me with ""do you still have it"" or ""is it still available"". I will assume 
you are a spam bot trying to get my email address and I will ignore you. ""I am 
interested"" is a close second that is being used also. I myself answer an ad with 
where I am located and when I would be available. That always gets a persons 
attention. I try to sell to the first person who contacts me first. After that I 
contact the second response and so on. This had always worked for me in the past, 
but as time changed and more people flaked on me or wanted me to wait beyond an 
agreed upon time/day, I have changed my method to a ""first with the cash gets the
prize"". As in everything communication is king, I can't read your mind. I am not 
interested in Shipping a gun anywhere but ike all things, If I get enough ridiculous 
offers and somebody just has to have this because it reminds them of the one dear 
old dad used to have and has more dollars than the local's sense, I will ship to 
your local FFL if he will accept a direct ship gun from a private owner. Postal 
Money order to be cleared first. I will not sell to a low baller, I will sell 
through afore mentioned Auction site or just keep the item.

 Disclaimers and Information:

 I am not a gun shop, there is no sales tax or background fees. I do not take credit 
cards. I also will not accept a cashier's check, personal check, money order or 
anything other than CASH. If you email me a low-ball offer and say that you will pay 
in CASH, like it is something special and I am selling a used car, I will assume you 
are a litttle retarded and shouldn't own a gun to begin with. Contact me and I will 
email the best pictures I can manage. No, I am not a professional photographer. I do 
not look at my phone all day hoping I have email. I check it when I get home from 
work and occasionally on the week ends. Please don't get discouraged and think I am 
ignoring you if I don't return an email in 5 minutes. I am not willing to drive 
across the state to meet you so that you can inspect the gun and make me an offer. 
Driving halfway across town is a different matter all together, but I hope you will 
have made your offer ahead of time. If not, I may take my toys and go home. Yes, I 
know what the asking price on Gunbroker is, I also know what they sell for along 
with shipping and transfer fee and credit card fee. I do not dignify ridiculous 
offers with a reasonable response, they will get a ridiculous response, if any 
response at all. I do not NEED to sell anything, I would just LIKE to. Reasonable 
offers are considered, not necessarily accepted, but considered. Please do not drag 
the moral character of my relatives into any disagreement, I can't help it, they are 
like that. Mom in particular. All firearms should be considered loaded at all times, 
they may not be, but it is safer to consider them that way. Spammers and scammers 
beware, I have a loaded LOIC (low orbit ion cannon) and I know how to use it. 

P.S. 

I am sorry this is sooo long but every day somebody fails to see reason and acts 
outside the bounds of my endurance. Check back often as the list continues to grow, 
ha."
