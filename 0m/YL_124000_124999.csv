Never fired Russian SKS, 1952, all original accessories and matching numbers
550 rounds of Silver Bear ammo
Value: 1,000.
Not interested in cash.
I'm not into these guns anymore since coming home from Iraq, they just bring back crappy memories having them around.

Wanting to trade for an AR15, I'd consider trading the SKS+ammo for an M1 Carbine.
Not interested if I have to travel further than 50 miles from Sedalia.
Don't bother if you're not a serious inquiry.

Thanks for reading."

This TRP is the model w/out the light rail (just plain armory kote). It has the original box, papers, etc.  Probably about 500 rounds through it at least. Perfectly reliable. After every shooting session I went over it with a fine tooth comb. This is an outstanding weapon and everything is smooth like melted butter. Tritium night sights are only about a year old, plenty bright.

Still looking!

Looking for my first Enfield. Would like to get my hands on whatever is available, provided it's a good shooter. Used to want the SMLE so I was kind of holding out for one of those, but will also take the No. 4 Mk 1s and the like. I can either pay or we can do some trading. Some sportering is okay, too, maybe.

Thanks a lot, let me know."

Smith Grade 00 in 12 Gauge.

L.C. Smith Grade 00 is from 1912, has auto-ejectors and is a twelve gauge. In good looking shape, it functions as do the auto-ejectors. The guy I got it from had it appraised for 1,600$ at a gun-show, and he was offered 1,200$ cash on the spot for it.

FN Browning Model 1900 in .32ACP, the serial numbers date somewhere from 1908-1912, it is hammerless, original grips, and has wear on it. It's missing a magazine, but that can be ordered online at panhandlegunslingers.com for 20$ in the original package, 15$ with no package, so I don't think that's really anything of an issue except for conveience.

I want to sell BOTH for 1600, so basically, but the L.C. Smith and get an FN Browning Model 1900.

553,http://www.armslist.com/posts/124553,For Sale/Trade:  A Few Guns,"South Austin, Austin, Texas",$ 0,"Listed On: Thursday, April 14, 2011",Rifles,Smith & Wesson                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"1) I have a very clean, low round count Smith and Wesson M&P 15 in 5.56/.223 It is a flat top with quad rails, Troy Industries front and rear flip up battle sights, Troy industries modular verticle for end grip, hogue rubber pistol grip with storage compartment and an EOTECH 517 you wont find a cleaner M&P15 on here.  Here is a list of what it cost me to put it together.
M&P15  $1,100.00
Quad Rails $100
Troy Front flip up battle sight $100
Troy Rear Flip up battle sight $100
Troy Modular Verticle fore end grip $75
Hogue rubber pistol grip $30
EOTECH 517 $500
Thats a grand total of $2,000 not including tax and all that that I spent.  Im would never expect to get that much back from selling this rifle but pleas keep that in mind if you want to make a cash offer.  The rifle has never been fired with the EOTECH.  I shot 150 rounds through it when I zeroed the Troy sights then I mounted the EOTECH later but never fired it again.  Im open to trades but to be honest the only reason I am putting it up is to get a Springfield SOCOM II or another version of a Springfield M1A.  If I dont get any good offers Ill just keep it and save up for the M1A.  

2) I have a gorgeous Smith and Wesson 686 .357/.38+P.  Not much to say, its a S&W.  These weapons hold their value and are beautiful wheel guns.  Has hogue wood grips on it and two boxes of Hornady .357.  Mostly looking to just trade. 

3) Norinco SKS Paratrooper with rare 20 round fixed Chinese Star magazine."

I'm looking for a nice used Springfield XD-9 with a 5inch barrel. I prefer the higher capacity mags but they're not required. I would like an easy trigger pull (2-3 lbs or so), and easy slide with resistance that's manageable for my wee girlie hands. If I can't rack it, I can't shoot it. Same goes for the mag eject button. If I can't load it, I can't shoot it.

Cash is possible, but pretty tight until May.

In the meantime-
I've got a couple trade options-  I have a lovely solid silver flute, Artley Wilkins model. It is not plated, it is indeed solid silver. C-foot, closed hole. This flute sells for between $700 and $1000.  I have it posted on Craigslist for $650.

I also have a .75ct diamond tongue stud. Round brilliant, Bezel set in white gold and mounted on a Surgical SS post and ball.  This is the engagement diamond from my first marriage, and I had it mounted into the tongue stud setting for kicks. It's definitely a conversation starter! I intend to post this on Craigslist for about $1500 or so.  As trade for this, let me know what you have. It's worth about three XD-9s.... 

Any pistols I get are for my personal use and I do have a MN Carry Permit.

Winchester model 94 NRA Centennial edition .30-30. This rifle has a 24 inch round barrel with a tubular magazine that does not run the full length of the barrel like most lever actions. The receiver is engraved NRA 1871-1971 on the left side and with some scroll on the right. It is also stamped NRA Centennial Rifle on the right side of the barrel. The stock is a very nice dark hardwood with an NRA medallion set into the right side of the buttstock. This rifle is not unfired but you would be hard pressed to find any evidence otherwise. Made in 1971.Comes with 2 boxes of Winchester 1894-1994 Centennial Special Edition Ammo , 1/2 box of Federal. No box or papers. Face to Face meet only . May entertain some trades, interested in 16inch- mid length, flat top, Ar 15- Spikes, Colt or Daniel Defense. Would match cash with trade. Thanks"

Very clean & as close to new as you can get Sig Sauer p226e2.  It's now called the ""Enhanced Elite"".  This pistol was made in Sept. of 2010.  It's had about 200 rounds fired through it.  It is a beautiful pistol, & deadly accurate.  It has a factory short trigger, a factory short reset trigger, factory Sig tritium night sights, & the newest ergonomic grip design with a smaller circumference & a reduced trigger reach for DA mode.  It is about the same reach as a S&W M&P with a medium grip, or a 1911 with Hogue grips on it.  It isn't a midget's gun.  It includes all the books, the box, lock, take down/cleaning tool, both 15 round factory mags, an aftermarket MecGar 18 round mag (MecGar makes all the factory mags for Sig, Browning, Beretta, etc. They are a much higher quality than promags), a Gould & Goodrich leather paddle holster w/ a covered trigger guard & a leather belt slide holster.  I really like this gun, but I don't want to ding it up dragging it back & forth to the range.

Nearly new (bought new and paid $580). I bought this for my girlfriend and she found the recoil too sharp for her tastes. It was never carried by her, strictly a nightstand pistol. I bought her a S&W 351PD in .22 WMR to replace it. She is only 100 pounds so non-recoil sensitive people will not be phased by the 642. This pistol only has 1 box of ammo through it. It is as close to new as you can imagine. +P rated Thank you. Local sales only.
