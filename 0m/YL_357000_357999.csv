And of course will add cash to even out the deal The 22a is a really nice entry level target pistol. It has a scope rail built in. Comes with 2 10 roiund magazines. Plastc box it came in. As well as the paper work. This is a pretty accurate gun I was shooting it against my 10/22 at about 50 yards and it was just as accurate. Wouldn't hurt my feelings a bit to keep this gun. But I am really wanting  one of the newer 22's on the market. Local deals only please. With the price of gas these days its just not worth driving very far for these low dollar guns."

Plus the Tapco additions & extra mags are another $150-175 easily. I will consider other trades, but an AR or cash would be my preference."

It's a great gun and there's been about 500 rounds shot through it. I've had no problems after initial break in (about 200 rounds), it likes american eagle, and hydra-shok. It is very dependable and will make someone a nice CC weapon. I am getting rid of it because I got this for my wife and she didn't like it, ended up preferring a revolver so she is now carrying an older snub .38.

You already know the pistol, Night Sights, Rubber Grips, DeCocker, 2 Ten Rd Mags.. Super Reliable, SUPER Accurate, and SUPER hard to get in this configuration.

Less than 50 rounds fired, ZERO glitches, Case and paperwork complete as being in a store glass case.  With CZ's enhancements this is BETTER than never been fired.  This fits your hand like a glove and looks like a museum masterpiece.  And if you run out of bullets hit 'em over the head once with this and they're out!

Yes you can find one for less, if you're very patient and a little lucky.  But even then it will not have been through CZ's magical touches and will certainly not look, feel or shoot any nicer than this.  And, no waiting if you call me first.  You will surely not be disappointed

Original ammunition in the original box embossed with the Nazi war eagle and dated 1937. In perfect mint condition. Looks like it was made yesterday. Pretty good for being 75 years old. This is copper jacketed, hollow steel core armor piercing incindiary, (yellow) tracer ammunition. 15 rounds per box, 1 box available. They are loaded on original 5 round stripper clips for the K98.

By armor piercing incindiary tracer, I mean: a round that can be seen in flight by the shooter, that will penetrate up to two inches of steel armor, and then explode at over 2500 degrees C lighting any flamable materials within five feet on fire. They don't make bullets like this anymore for obvious reasons.

It was intended for fighter aircraft or the MG-34, but it will work in any rifle chambered for the 8MM (7.92mm) Mauser cartridge including the MG-42. You will never get another chance to buy these.

This ammunition was designed to detonate the fuel tank of whatever it was fired at, and a single bullet can take down a B-17 with a well placed shot. These bullets were responsible for many thousands of Allied aircraft losses in WWII.

These are being sold as military collectables and are not intended to be used as ammunition. However, you could if you wanted to. They still work just fine.

Looking to trade for a cheapo .22 revolver, .38 revolver, Mosin Nagant carbine, interesting WWII and WWI collectables, Soviet military stuff, sabres, and the like.

I have decided to sell my COLT 38 Bankers Special, its a .38 caliber 6 Shot Revolver DA/SA that was made and used by bankers from 1926 until 1940. There were 2 styles made, the PRE 1933's and the POST 1933's. PRE 1933's had a square style butt on them and in 1933 they went to an all round butt. This COLT Bankers Special is the PRE 1933, it has the square Butt. 
There were only around 35,000 ever made, most were given to the Bankers of that time due to the Super Snub nose it had. THIS IS A VERY RARE COLT, if you are familiar with GunBroker, there was currently 1, just one, on there for sale and it had 39 bids and ended an hair under $1,900 for just the gun, no box, no papers. Same as this one. Its the only one i have ever seen for sale, I'm sure there are a few more out there but no one wants to part with em. The gun is in great shape, all original, and has original Wooden 2 piece grips on it. It could be taken to the range and shot today if you chose to do so. Its a Great little gun, the design is eye catching and its in amazing shape
 and on top of all that... its a COLT.

When Colt quit making the Mustang, Iver Johnson was said to have bought the Molds and Machining for the Mustang and Produced the PO380 Pony for a few years. They are pretty rare and hard to find now and due to that, there price has jumped up. They look just like the Mustang and are everybit as simple, reliable, and accurate. This one is in the original box with the original papers as well. There is not a spot on it, bluing is bright and perfect with no flaws. Would be willing to meet at whatever gunsmith to assure that it has not been REblued, it is all original!
Great gun to put up and store or use as a back up gun.

Has been modified with Wolff springs to reduce recoil, double action pull and mag release force. Recoil and double action pull are the two main complaints about this gun. A stronger recoil spring makes it much more comfortable to shoot. a weaker hammer spring reduces the force required for the double action pull and makes it much easier to release the magazine.

The small size and single stack mag makes this a very nice gun for concealed carry. Fits easily in a pocket and there are various holsters available.

Bought it new a few years ago and it has been on a couple of m4’s but mostly used on prop guns for film/tv.  Comes with the carry handle mount for the m16 ar15 a2 design and also fits the removable carryhandle sight used on flat top AR’s.   This is the only mount I have for this optic, others are available online but this is specifically for AR type weapons.  Comes with the threaded on polarizing lens/filter (not pictured).  This does not require batteries, it is Tritium Illuminated as well as light gathering optical fiber front to increase intensity in daylight.   
Appearance wise it’s a little nicked up (actors have no regard for props) but function wise it’s perfect.  Price reflects cosmetic flaws.  Price is firm also.
This mount allows you to co-witness with sights of the weapon it’s mounted on.  Very easy to use and adjust your windage and elevation.  This package deal is over $600.00 new.  

Note:  This does not come with the carry handle sight, it is in the pics for reference only.  The carry handle sight is available for an additional 60.00 if you need one. Thanks

I had to put a lot of restoration work to the stock suck as wood putty and glue plus I coated it with a durable textured rubber coating that mimics a modern synthetic stock,I tried to just re stain and seal it but i could not hide the repairs unless I painted or covered the stock.I know that the 6.5 mm is popular with the long shooter community and collectors but not hunters and with good reason!this is not a rifle for a novice or beginner,the action is very tricky and you must handle the gun with finess and respect .....I suggest you practice opening and closing the bolt untill you get the hang of it before you load a round and also only use the Japanese 6.5 rounds in the gun.....Mauser or Italian style 6.5 rounds will not chamber entirely correct in thegun and cause problems.

Selling because my lady says i have to many toys, so this is the first to go.

I'm going to list and take photos of all cosmetic defects. I figure i would want the same information if i was going to buy a gun based on an add. 

ACTION: Everything in the action works flawlessly. The hammer has turned dark with age and finger oil.
BLUING: Some holster wear and shallow nicks on the metal on the butt of the frame and a small nick next to the screw on the ejector housing and  above the rear sight screw. The cylinder has some wear in-between the locks. Some surface rust in minor areas.
GRIPS: the factory wood grips have some minor chipping but no cracks. 
BORE: good to very good condition

Have shot this gun dozens of times, bought it mostly to help out a friend in need of dough. Came in handy teaching my lady how to shoot and getting some friends into shooting. Ammo is dirt cheap and the hammer has to pulled every time you want it go bang so its a safe(r) fire arm than lets say, a Glock. And go bang it does. shot over 1000rds thru in the three years ive had it, never had a failure (its a revolver)."

However, I never got around to making a chamber casting. Cases are formed from 30-30 Win. The barrel is 24"" long, 5/8"" at the muzzle & 1 1/8"" at breech and weighs in at 5lbs. Rifling is excellent and appears to be four groove button with a right-hand twist. Threads are in very good shape. Bluing is very good with a very deep blue color. It has been drilled and tapped for (per previous owner) Unertl mounts. It is stamped with P.O. Ackley on the top about 1/3 way down. It is also stamped .219 Wasp on the left side of the barrel by the threads. This apparently is one of the two methods for barrel stamping barrels actually made by Ackley.

Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight - The tactical advantage for precision sighting in any light. Initially designed for the M16 family, every feature of the ACOGs mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose - to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions. The exterior of the ACOG is a forged aluminum body (aircraft strength 7075 alloy) which is precision machined to exacting tolerances then hard-anodized. ACOG’s are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights that use tritium illuminated reticles for target acquisition in all light conditions - even total darkness. Manufactured and tested to exceed military standards, The ACOG 4x32 model was chosen by U.S. Special Operations Command for all Special Forces Units including Navy Seals, Rangers, and Green Beret.

The ACOG is also in service with many federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies. ACOG gives you the edge in any light to keep your focus sharp. Both full size ACOG models (4x32 & 3.5x35) are available with the popular Bindon Aiming Concept which is achieved using a unique combination of advanced fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. Using dual-illumination technology, originally developed for the military and proven in combat, the fiber optic light collector illuminates the aiming point automatically balancing the brightness with the shooting conditions. The tritium illuminates the aiming point even in total darkness. The result: lightening-fast precision aiming in any light without failure-prone batteries - for maximum shooting success."

959,http://www.armslist.com/posts/357959,For Sale:  Swarovski HD STM 65 Scope Body,"Columbus, Ohio, United States","$ 1,750","Listed On: Wednesday, April 4, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Swarovski HD STM 65 - Scope Body Magnesium


Swarovski Optik's an Austrian family-owned company steeped in the tradition of producing superlative binoculars and telescopes.  Their products are often icons of both optics and aesthetics, with the posh spotting scopes being hallmarks of the distinguished brand.

The STM-65 HD Spotting Scope is the flagship compact model, featuring an objective element made with extra-low dispersion glass.  This provides an even more remarkable image than the ""normal"" STM-65, with better edge resolution.  In particular, color fringing is nearly eliminated.  Intricately-patterned subjects will have more crisp delineation, something enthusiastic birders will greatly appreciate, and the more refined color rendition can give an impression of enhanced brightness.  However it is defined, it would be hard to conceive of a better view originating from a prismatic refractor telescope.  And this is a scope which could accompany any tough hike without weighing you down.

The STM-65 HD also has Swarovski's latest external coatings for repelling moisture, dust, and debris.  They stay clean longer, and clean easily.  Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, the STM/STM series features a fully magnesium housing construction, shaving a few precious drops of weight without giving up an ounce of rigidity.

This is the angled version of Swarovski's 65mm scope-they've also got a straight viewing model.  Generally speaking, angled scopes are better for viewing elevated subjects and are unquestionably easier to share amongst a group of observers.  An angled scope requires a bit of experience to find subjects in the scope, although the STM-65 HD does have a side-mounted peepsight to aid initial locating.

The STM-65 has a focal length of 460mm.  If you're using conventional 1.25"" astronomy eyepieces with the optional #44010 Astronomy Eyepiece Adapter, divide 460mm by the focal length of your eyepiece to determine the effective magnification.

• High definition objective glass element with fluoride yields better subject edges and superior digiscoping imagery
• Incredibly-precise tolerances and efficient baffling upon all optical surfaces
• Swarovski's microthin coatings produce optimum light transmission and resolution

• Fantastic optional digiscoping adapter, as well as a SLR adapter
• Environmentally friendly lead and arsenic free glass

Swarovski Optik produces some of the world's finest optical designs and products. Their brilliant, innovative optical products & designs exemplify their commitment to uncompromising quality.

Swarovski's STM-65, delivers the same legendary high-performance viewing capabilities of its immediate non-HD predecessor, with a poignant twist - its housing is constructed from a lightweight yet extremely durable magnesium alloy.

The STM-65 delivers spectacular imaging performance - its optical system features precision ground and fully multicoated all-glass lenses with SWAROCLEAN coatings to ensure a bright, crisp, and well detailed viewing experience. Highly efficient porro prisms provide both a traditional form factor and outstanding imaging accuracy.

Functionally, the STM-65 is quite an advanced optic - the retractable sun-shade and detented rotating tripod collar offer versatility and resiliency in the face of real-life adversities. With the addition of the UCA camera adapter, a sturdy tripod, and a balance plate, the STM-65 scope converts into a potent ultra-telephoto digiscoping lens.

Swarovski Optik produces some of the world's finest optical designs and products. Their brilliant, innovative optical products & designs exemplify their commitment to uncompromising quality.

Swarovski's flagship-model spotting scope, the STM-80 HD, delivers the same legendary high-performance viewing capabilities of its immediate predecessor, with a poignant twist - its housing is constructed from a lightweight yet extremely durable magnesium alloy.

Swarovski's HD optics nearly eliminates optical distractions such as color fringing and a lack of color-rendition. In fact - the optical refinements of the STM-80 HD result in what one might call an outdoor viewing-nirvana. Scoping with the STM-80 HD reveals a field of view with intricately-patterned subjects with crisp delineation - something enthusiastic birders will greatly appreciate.

An important consideration for hikers and digiscopers is the fact that despite this spotting scopes impressive profile and viewing capabilities, its weight remains just under 3 lb/1.4 kg - a not-so-simple feat of manufacturing that is due in part to this fine optic's rugged yet lightweight magnesium housing.

Optical Performance
80 mm objective
BAK4 prism optimizes light transmission
HD optics: multicoated fluoride glass elements for superior edge-sharpness, digiscoping imagery, twilight performance
Fully multicoated on all air-to-glass surfaces
SWAROCLEAN coating: The non-stick proprietary external coating makes cleaning/removing dried-on mineral residue, insect repellent, and tree resin easier. Over time the lens' surface will require less intensive cleaning which significantly increases the longevity of the optic.

Same model and mark  (it was a no1, mark 3)  The only differences in the one I have is the stock has been replaced with a more useable modern ATI stock, (I have the altered original stock), and of course it has the Scope so you don’t have to use the iron sites.  It is the harder to find original 10 round magazine load number 1 mark 3, the metal has never been refinished.  It fires predictable.

These were famous WW1 rifles known for their speed of action and how fast the British riflemen could fire on target.

If you’re interested I also have some hard to find extras like another barrel (very hard to find) 2 extra bolt heads, an extra extractor spring, extra bolt body and the partial original stock.  This was in my grandfather’s stuff when he past years ago and I never thought about selling or trading it till now.  It has been gone over completely, and the new stock was done for modern handling and safer usage.  It’s a piece of history that can be used today, and includes hard to find spares."
