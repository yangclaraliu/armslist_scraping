The new Benelli Vinci marks a revolution in hunting shotguns. Benelli presents the fastest-shooting, softest-kicking, most reliable lightweight 12-gauge shotgun in the world. The innovative design of this semi auto shotgun raises the standard in firearms technology. Driven by a passion for efficiency and simplicity, Benelli engineers have advanced the cutting edge. The superbly balanced Vinci embodies a new way of looking at shotgun design. The revolutionary new In-Line Inertia Driven® operating system, with superior reliability and lightning fast speed, is the simplest semi-auto shotgun operating system ever devised.

Advanced ergonomics assure fluid gun movement. Combine that with the ComforTech® Plus recoil reduction system, and Benelli puts in your hands the world’s softest-kicking shotgun. In recent lab tests, the competition had up to 72-percent more felt recoil than the Vinci. And, its modular design makes Vinci the easiest shotgun on the planet to assemble and disassemble. No wonder it’s named for Leonardo da Vinci, the great Italian Renaissance inventor, artist, and thinker who shattered the technological boundaries of his world. Let the revolution begin."

I got rid of the tube and installed a PRI free float rifle length over a lopro GB. I upgraded the CH to a gunfighter. AFG was stippled and is installed.

This gun is in fine working order, all original, and with an added RedHead scope.  My father owned this gun before I was even born.  He is now 94 and in a nursing home.  For the past 12 years it was used to shoot squirrels in his backyard.  He added the scope because he couldn't see anymore....lol.

I learned how to shoot with this rifle at about age 6 or 7.

It shoots any 22 round from bird shot to LR.  I am not a gun expert or collector.  It just doesn't need to be in his or my house and its time to sell it.

Looking at pricing guides I have chosen $475.  I would not put it at excellent condition but I would add value for the scope.

New ones are crazy expensive to buy now.

I have posted 3 pics here.  I have more I can send you that shows the internals and condition.

I will ship, but I will only ship from FFL to FFL.  No individual shipping to an FFL.  Buyer to pay those expenses."

 * Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK-47.
 * The bolt of the VZ 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.
 * The VZ 58 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
 * The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the VZ 58.
 * The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the VZ 58.
 * The VZ 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools. 
* The alloy magazine of the VZ 58 is half the weight of the steel AK-47 magazine. (.42 lb. vs. .84 lb.)
 * VZ 58 is easier to field strip.
 * The VZ 58 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK-47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure trade value is $600. i have a total of 6-30 rnd mags with it. no cash price i want to trade toward a basic off brand ar 15 as long as it functions right text or call for fast response. 1-931-644-9928 . these are excellent quality wepons and a blast to shoot and also very accurate. . must be legal to own"

Durability and dead-on accuracy have made Troy Industries Folding BattleSights the hands-down choice of Special Ops and tactical users worldwide. Easy to install and to deploy, with no levers or springs to fumble with, these sights position apertures at exact factory height. A stainless-steel cross-locking system ensures sights remain upright and zeroed under extreme combat conditions. A push of a button folds the sights securely out of the way until you need them again (they fold to a profile of just 0.460). Troy BattleSights feature a zero-canting attachment system for use on all military and aftermarket receivers.

The sights feature two settings, one for up to 300 meters and a second for up to 500 meters. This versatility makes the DOA ideal for military, law enforcement and home defense applications. These advanced sights have been extensively field-tested and, like all Troy Industries products, are Battle Ready.

Note: Sight is designed to work on same plane rail systems only. Will not work with a railed gas block that is higher or lower than the receiver.

USP's are smaller and lighter than the larger frame USP - SCOM. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP  uses a full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
Like their large frame predecessors, USP's  are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP  is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P+ loads full time .
To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP , the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. 
Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP  is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.
Features & System Characteristics:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life. 200,000 rounds design tested.

These field strip very easily. Comes with 2 factory mags, holster.  All parts are still available for this gun through Sarco, but they have a reputation for longevity so I doubt you will need any. This is a rugged all steel weapon that is built to last. If you are tired of the toy plastic guns available today, this is the ticket. Must have current permit, no exceptions.

CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.

Genuine Civil War Relic (NOT a replica).  A prize for any Civil War enthusiast!

Serial Number 13327 (stamped into cylinder and frame [under hammer])
Patent Date Jan 15, 1956 (stamped into the side of the frame)
Starr Arms Co, New York (stamped into the side of the frame)

I would describe the condition as good considering its vintage.  The company name, patent date, serial number and other markings can easily be read in various locations where they are stamped into the metal.  There is some pitting on the frame above the magazine cylinder from oxidation.  The outline of the inspectors mark can be seen faintly where it was stamped into the wood handle, but the inspectors initials are no longer visible.  The wooden handle has a some scratches and dents.  The front trigger has approximately 1/4"" of free travel in the released position, this is apparently due to a weak trigger return spring ... probably an easy fix for any competent gunsmith.

If you research this item you will find it selling for much higher prices on various internet sites ($1,000 and higher).  I am offering it for very good price … priced to sell.

Text found on reference #4:
“About 23,000 double-action Starr revolvers were manufactured in the late 1850s and early 1860s. Of these, most were purchased by the U.S. Army. Starr revolvers, in both single-and double-action models, represented over 12 percent of the sidearms issued to Union cavalry troops. Only Colt and Remington revolvers were more frequently encountered in the hands of Northern soldiers.

One of the earliest American double-action revolvers, this six-shot revolver has a six-inch round barrel rifled with six grooves. Over-all length is 11 5/8 inches, weight is two pounds 12 ounces, and the cylinder is 1 7/8 inches long. These revolvers have a steel blade front sight dovetailed into the barrel. A V-notch cut into the hammer lip serves as a rear sight. The Starr revolver is provided with a knurled screw on the right side of the frame which, when removed, allows the barrel to tip downwards on its hinged frame so that the cylinder can be removed.

Starr revolvers were invented by Eben Townsend Starr of New York City, grandson of Nathan Starr and son of Nathan Starr, Jr., famous U. S. swordmakers and riflemakers of Middletown, Connecticut. This model is marked on the right side of its frame ""STARR'S PATENT JAN. 15, 1856."", and on the left side, ""STARR. ARMS. Co. NEW YORK."" The patent date refers to E. T. Starr's U. S. Patent 14,118 for a self-cocking percussion pepperbox. His U.S. Patent 30,843, December 4, 1860, was for his double-action revolver.

Starr firearms were made at Yonkers, Binghamton, and Morrisania, New York, from 1858 to 1867. The New York City address referred to the Starr Arms Company store and office at 267 Broadway. Starr double-action .44 caliber revolvers, with serial numbers from 1 to about 23,000, were manufactured first, and Starr single-action .44 caliber revolvers, with serial numbers from about 23,000 to about 54,000, last.”"

I have one of the safes places east of the Mississippi River that you can imagine.  This property is perfect for those who looking to escape the coming world chaos. This area has been chosen by most professional preppers as the number one place to have a bugout retreat for family safety.

The property is a total of 321 plus acres and is flat to slightly rolling.
It is around 2000 foot above sea level, with a beautiful bluff view.
The property has a very nice creek running through it and has a couple places to make a fairly large pond.
There are no restrictions on this property or any kind of zoning. You can still live as free and simple as you like.

This property is semi isolated, but only a few minutes from stores, etc.. and is covered up with wildlife, such as deer, turkey, rabbit, squirrel, etc......

This is a private sale I have two of these properties in the same area and live full time hear on a 386 acre retreat.  This is an excellent opportunity not only for your family safety, but also for investment.  Because if things keep deteriorate across the United States, this kind of family safe property will become a hard to find hot commodity.  On the other hand if the economy does recover you could easily double or triple your investment. Taxes will be around $1000 per year on the entire 321 acres.

I am asking $1200 per acre and open to other offers.
If this sounds like something you would be interested in give me a call.

Basically it was a bipartisan agreement during the 2011 budget deal that the Bush tax cuts for everyone expire January 1st, 2013 and, according to the Budget Control Act of 2011, automatic budget cuts occur.  

If we don't go off the fiscal cliff (i.e. Republicans cave on Obama's absurd proposals), the debt ceiling will likely be removed as part of the deal and spending will likely stay the same or increase, thereby increasing our deficit and debt.  

If we do go off the fiscal cliff (at this point I hope we do so we can lay this whole higher-taxes-is-all-we-need mindset to rest) then the deficit will be cut in half (mind you it'd still be higher than any deficit pre-Obama but significantly less-bad as the $1 trillion plus deficits we've had the past four years).

If we go off the fiscal cliff the value of the dollar will likely INCREASE! Not decrease.  This is because our debt would be increasing slower (and we'd likely enter a recession, slowing inflation).

If we don't go off the cliff, the dollar will likely lose value at a greater rate.  

But in actuality, if was the three rounds of quantitative easing and tripling of the M1 and M2 that will be giving us the most trouble for the next decade.

Fort Knox isn't empty nor is the even bigger vault under NYC.  Gold may not have peaked yet but I wouldn't call it the best investment.  Guns are always good because they serve a purpose, but the gun buying fervor will die down after people realize there is little to no chance Obama can do anything with a Republican House and SCOTUS precedents securing the 2nd amendment.

Buy other metals (aluminum, metal fabricators and producers, tungsten, scrap companies) if you dare put your money in the stock market at all.

If you are worried about the apocalypse, buy cigarettes.

I can meet within a reasonable distance. It is for sale only - no trades at this time!

The Browning BDA 380 pistol was introduced in 1980 or so as a compact and lightweight pistol for police and civilian use. The gun was manufactured in Italy under contract from FN Herstal (Belgium) and marketed as FN model 140DA (in Europe) or Browning BDA 380 (in USA). Some sources said that BDA 380 is a copy of Beretta 84, but close inspection shows some differences (i.e. Beretta 84 has frame mounted safety while BDA 380 has slide mounted safety). It was adopted by Belgian police.

The BDA 380 is a blow-back operated, double action semi automatic pistol. It has aluminum alloy frame and steel slide. Ambidextrous slide mounted safety switch disconnects the trigger from the hammer when engaged. The pistol featured low profile fixed sights and was available in either polished steel or blued finish, with wooden grip panels."

It's got the older forged steel hammer & trigger and no internal lock. Excellent shape, both mechanically & aesthetically, with minor handling marks here and there. Doesn't show much use from firing or carrying. Very smooth action, as is common with these 90's vintage Centennials. No box or papers. 

Will come with a set of standard magnas as the smooth stocks and Tyler-T are gone. They only made a handful of the 640's, for about a year, with the forged steel parts before switching to MIM hammers and triggers. I'm not going to say its ""rare"", but its certainly not one you see everyday and took a while for me to track down in this condition.

I recently picked this up and have come up on a need for cash, so this is one I am just going to have to move on. It is a great rifle, shoots beautifully. It has the trigger adjusted to break cleanly at 3.5 lbs with no creep or over travel. It will come with the pictured accessories, the cheek pad with integrated parts pouch and ammo carrier, the Butler Creek padded sling, spring loaded bi-pod, padded airline acceptable lockable case, and 75 rounds of ammo. The gun is very ergonomic with textured palm and fore grip swells, very nice recoil pad, well balanced with the heavy barrel, cheek weld, and precision trigger. These guns are known as some of the best ever designed, can't really go wrong with a deal like this. I will include the scope mount and rings, along with the mil-dot lit reticle scope with sun shade and lens caps pictured. It is not a top end scope, and has some wear to it, but is plenty usable.

THE following description is available at diamondbackfirearms.com

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAMMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain.

The use of +P, +P+, reloaded, or NON-SAMMI Spec ammunition will void the firearms warranty.

DISCLAIMER: Crimson Trace Corporation© DB .380 specific laser mount is not designed for the DB9. Use of the CTC laser mount on the DB9 will void the manufacturers warranty."
