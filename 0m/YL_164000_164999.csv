It's a great gun, accurate, powerful and easy to clean due to the stainless, and I have taken much pride in owning it. After each session of shooting it has received a complete teardown cleaning, most people look at it and assume it's never been fired. A keen eye would notice slight discoloration of the business end of the hammer and darkening around the cap nipples from normal use, that's about it. This is my gun of choice for fun shooting, due to ease of loading and cleaning compared to other BP guns I've owned. I don't want to sell it, but I'm in a bind. I'll throw in all the BP goodies I have, partial containers of both BP and Pyrodex, however many balls are left (couple dozen I think) the starter kit with powder measure, capper, wrench, etc, tons of caps, flask, zippered soft case, and whatever cleaning accessories I have for it. Should be a great deal for someone wanting to try out this kind of shooting, or a nice addition to an established collection.

The Grip Pod® System (GPS®) is a revolutionary new vertical foregrip integrated with a strong and stable bipod. The Grip Pod's legs deploy at the push of a button-instantly! It's the ultimate improvement to any weapon system currently employing a vertical grip. Using the Grip Pod® System, the operator can go from a CQB position to a prone-and have a stable base for aimed firing in place before hitting the ground. Say goodbye to cumbersome bipods that have to be manually clipped on or folded into position. And because it's manufactured from aerospace materials it's designed to exceed military specifications for construction and finish, and built tough to withstand hard use."

Everyone is different about what parts they want and work they want done on their 1911 and with this said this may or may not be what you are looking for in a 1911. This is what has been done to the gun:

45 degree crowning of barrel 
Throating of the barrel
Polishing of the throat and ramp
Lowering of the ejection port
Flaring of ejection port
Les Baer flat M/S housing SS serr.
Removing the locking mechanism from the M/S housing and adding a pin
Wilson Combat ultralight match long trigger (three hole)
Wilson Combat High ride stainless bullet proof beavertail
Wilson Combat deluxe commander bullet proof hammer (skeleton)
Trigger job along with reliability package

I bought this from Academy Sports the day it came in and it cost me $758 out the door (receipt in hand 6/14/11). The parts and gunsmith work was little over $800 (straight to gunsmith and received back on 7/7/11). Again this was what I wanted, brand, style and it being a GI Mil-Spec in stainless steel. This was cheaper then buying a bare slide and receiver and building up. If your looking for a regular stainless steel GI Mil-Spec this is NOT the one, but if you are looking for a 1911 with some custom work done and room for more custom work then this may be the gun. These are actual pictures now of the item for sale.

While in the military you are not allowed to sell this knife or give it away to anyone that is not immediate family, and they are not allowed to sell it or give it to anyone.  If you do you would be punished under UCMJ.  After studying the laws, and speaking with an attorney I have learned that since I am no longer in the military, so I don't fall under UCMJ, and I'm free to sell this knife (or hopefully trade).  This is a rare opportunity since very few people will part with their Yarboroughs.  The serial number is the important part here, since there are comparable knives made by Chris Reeves, but if you speak with any collectors they will let you know that it's not possible to get one with a Serial Number.  I was in 1st Special Forces Group, and on this post I will not give the Serial Number since I still feel discretion is important.  I would love to trade this knife for an AR15, SKS, or other Assault Rifle."

Browning 30-06 Springfield Lever Action BLR Model 81 (1990's)

The Browning Lever Action Rifle was introduced in 1971. This model is the fast handling straight grip stock. The simple takedown mechanism quickly and easily separates the rifle into two compact pieces for travel or easy storage. A scout type scope base is available as an option. From antelope to deer, from hogs to elk, the BLR remains the first choice of those who favor the lever action.

It is extremely accurate or at least I am extremely accurate with it, better accuracy than 1911’s that cost me twice as much.

Stevens Arms & Tool Company's entry into the center fire lever arena. Although some sources claim that there were 26,000 of these guns made, it is more likely that only about 5,000 were made. It was produced (or at least cataloged) from 1911 through 1917 and serialized with at least one other Stevens gun during that period (which accounts for the high production number). It is a unique design, capturing the best features of its competitor’s guns (Winchester and Marlin) at the time. It was tapped on the top of the receiver for a scope or target sight, ejects to the right and is very esthetically pleasing with its 22"" barrel and 2/3 magazine. Apparently sales did not go well which accounts for the relative scarcity of these rifles. 

This gun is in excellent condition for its age. It is chambered for the 35 Remington cartridge. The metal is in exceptional condition with the bluing better than 85% remaining on the receiver and barrel. The magazine tube and forend cap show thinning blue as does the bottom of the receiver from carrying. Overall, the gun is in great condition for its age. There is no box or original paperwork with this gun."

This is a US military training rifle in 22LR with production dates between 1984-1986.

The general characteristics of the 541X include a medium weight 27” barrel (bolt face to muzzle), that features a recessed (.020”) target-style crown.  The barrel is .810” in diameter at the muzzle.  The 541X is a clip fed bolt action rifle.  The plastic clip holds 6 rounds.  Although it looks fairly conventional, the action of this rifle is somewhat unusual for American rifles in that it is a rear lockup bolt action rifle.  The bolt also has dual extractors.  Distinctive markings on the barrel include 541X Target stamped at the top center of barrel and some proof marks on the barrel just forward of the receiver.  Markings on the receiver include the serial number and “US” stamped just above the serial number.

The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating bolt for positive lock-up.
The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. Maximum effective range with the standard 6-inch barrel is 200 meters (650 ft.).
The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear and enhances the obturation between the bullet and the bore, thus increasing accuracy.
Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The combat-type trigger guard is designed for two-handed shooting.
The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition.
When the last round in the magazine is fired, the slide remains in its maximum recoil position, permitting rapid change of magazine and immediate chambering of a round for instant resumption of firing."

The Winchester Ranger Model 120 was a cheaper version of the Model 1300. there were only 5000 made of these shotguns. They were aimed at Military and Police sells. However thanks to Ducks Unlimited a large number were introduced into the civilian market when they were given as prises at dinners. And once the public saw them and relized they were the same as the 1300 model for way less money the shotguns went very quickly. Winchester never got the contracts they wanted and stopped production of the shotgun after only a couple of years (1986 thru the beginning of 1989} because they wanted to make more money on there 1300's. Since there were only a limited production of them and since the plant closed it's doors in the United States and moved it's production to Japan. The price of these shotguns are going up in value. It's not uncommon to see them on Guns of America in average shape going for $250 to $450. However last year in 2008 a 20 ga. was sold on there site new in the box for $1800. This shows that collectors are starting to take a serious look at this model.

There was some rust that was removed from the butt stock when I got it due to fact it was stored in a gun safe for a long time. The wood has the Russian Red finish on it and is made out of Arctic Birch (or ""Russian Birch""). The wood, however is not perfect. It has got some dings as well as some of the finish has come off.

I have had this shotgun awhile but I have never carried it on a hunt or shot more than 3-4 boxes of shells through it the entire time I have owned it.  It has remained in a padded soft case and appears to be in excellent condition, though I am no appraiser.  I cleaned the gun after the last time I shot it and it was never exposed to the elements for long.

I'm not a dealer.
      I have stippled the grip and fluffed and buffed the barrel. I took it to the range and put 250 rounds through it several different brands both Ball ammo and hollow point with only two FTE's. Call it the break in period; blame it on the ammo.

Here is the item details below. Light and grip work great and are in great shape. Only looking for trades at this time. These things are $650 new. Someone will get a great deal.


The M900A attaches by means of an integral Swing-Lever™ rail clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail on the underside of the forend. This WeaponLight produces a brilliant beam configured for close- to medium-range applications, and also features two low-output navigation lights available in white, red, or blue. Primary beam output is 125 lumens for one-hour of runtime using an MN10 lamp assembly (included) or 225 lumens for 20 minutes using an MN11 lamp assembly (included). The M900A has four primary beam switches: two momentary-on pressure pads to activate the main light (one on each side for ambidextrous operation), a constant-on rotary switch for the main light, and a system-disable switch that locks all lights in the OFF position to prevent accidental activation during covert operations, transport, or storage. The navigation lights are operated by a momentary-on pressure pad thumb switch. The optional KT4 conversion kit replaces the standard 1.62"" diameter head with a 2.5"" diameter head that produces a more focused, extended-range beam. Available in Black and Desert Sand. 

FITS: Rifles, carbines, or submachine guns with a Picatinny rail on the underside of the forend. (See our Picatinny Rail Forends to equip your weapon with multiple integral forend rails.)

Mark's Firearms is a proud distributor of Ballistol
 Sportsman's Oil, once you use it, 
you will not want to use any other.
 Do not settle for any thing else!

$11.99 16oz Liquid Can Sportsmans oil
 $88.60 1 Gal. Liquid Can Sportsmans oil
 $360.95 5 Gal. Liquid Can Sportsmans oil

Ballistol is all-natural, non-toxic and does not lose its ability to lubricate even when mixed with water. Cleans black powder residue and is not petro-chemical based, so it will not affect a ""seasoned"" muzzleloader or black powder cartridge gun.
 Notes:Many Uses

Protects Guns (also dissolves traces of copper, lead, brass and black powder residues)
 Neutralizes Acids and Acidic Residues
 Emulsifies with Water for Dilution, yet Holds its Properties

BALLISTOL dissolves traces of lead, copper, zinc, brass and tombac, which are used to make projectiles and jackets for them. Residues of these metals will remain in the bore of any firearms as a result of shooting jacketed or unjacketed lead projectiles. The use of BALLISTOL makes scraping or brushing the bore unnecessary. Just pour or spray enough into the barrel and chamber, turn the firearm around several times to allow the liquid to reach all parts and let it ""go to work"". Later, the residues will then completely be cleaned out.




Due to its alkaline character BALLISTOL is ideal for cleaning and maintaining black powder firearms. BALLISTOL eliminates the need for brutal mechanical scrubbing and aggressive solvents. 
Of course, you should also use BALLISTOL to treat your holsters, belts and carrying slings.

FIREARMS - Cleans & dissolves traces of copper, lead, brass, zinc, & tombac. Lubricates & protects firearms, lock, stock & barrel. Forms a film that protects against rust. Will never gum-up or harden. Ideal for pistol grips, & rifle stocks.

BLACK POWDER - Dissolves black powder residues. Emulsifies with water. Mildly alkaline, neutralizes acids. Excellent patch lube.

LEATHER - Use on boots, shoes, gloves, holsters, slings, & saddles. Protects leather against water. Keeps leather soft & pliable, will darken lighter colors. Do not use on suede.

KNIVES & TOOLS - Lubricates, cleans, & protects metal, plastic, rubber, & wood. Outstanding penetrating oil, creeps into the finest cracks, loosens nuts & bolts. Also use as a cutting/boring oil (20:1). 

MARINE - Use in motor compartments, on joints, links, wire pulls, & around battery terminals. Protects electrical contacts. Beautifies faded gel coats. Lubricates zippers, push buttons, & winches. Great for fishing rods, reels, & tackle. Protects Aluminum, prevents pitting.

ROAD & TRAIL - Lubricates autos, motorcycles, bicycles, rollerblades, skateboards, skis, & sports equipment. Protects all camping gear.
