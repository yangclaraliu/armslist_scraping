""...The stated reasons for making this change were the superior accuracy of the 1911 platform and SWAT's satisfaction with their Kimber pistols.""

One of the most elite tactical law enforcement units in America, the LAPD Special Investigation Section - or SIS - was formed in 1965. Specially trained in surveillance, these plain-clothes professionals often stake out and covertly follow violent criminals until they can make an arrest during the commission of a crime. SIS is also a trendsetter, developing tactics and testing special weapons before they are generally issued. Due to the nature of their assignments, SIS Detectives depend on their pistols to a much greater extent than uniformed officers or tactical team members.

In 2002, LAPD SWAT selected a Kimber 1911 .45 ACP as their duty pistol, purchased approximately 160 units and placed them in service. In 2005, SWAT Team members put SIS Detectives in contact with Kimber, and the Detectives requested that Kimber work with them to create a duty pistol that met their high standards and unique requirements. The stated reasons for making this change were the superior accuracy of the 1911 platform and SWAT's satisfaction with their Kimber pistols. In development for over two years, Kimber SIS pistols are now a reality.

What began as a single pistol became a family of four models that would serve a full spectrum of tactical needs. SIS was given Departmental approval to transition to the Kimber 1911 in late 2006, and completed the transition in 2007. SIS also agreed that these pistols could be offered to the public.

SIS pistols have stainless steel slides, frames and serrated mainspring housings. Unique features include flat top slide and the SIS Night Sight with a cocking shoulder that allows one-hand cocking. The lightweight SIS Hammer reduces lock time and improves accuracy, and the solid trigger, SIS-pattern slide serrations, gray KimPro II finish and black small parts give these pistols a striking appearance. Beavertail grip safeties are bumped and grooved, slide and frame edges are softened with a Kimber Service Melt and ambidextrous thumb safeties are included. A stainless steel KimPro Tac-Mag premium magazine and stippled black laminate logo grips are also standard.

Both the SIS Custom and SIS Custom RL feature a short guide rod for quick field stripping. The SIS Ultra incorporates a rounded mainspring housing and frame. Most importantly, each of the four models has unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance. Once again, Kimber is the choice of America's best."

Looking to trade it for another .45

I am really looking for another mid size 1911 but will consider options below:

SIG Railed GSR
SIG Scorpion + a little cash on my end
Springer Champ Operator
Springer MC Operator
M&P45 DE =Mid Size + Your cash or Rem 870 to make up difference
SIG P220R
HK USP45's

I would like to keep this FTF in Ponca City as the wife has the car for school 99% of the time. But we can try and work something else out if all else fails!

It has a side-mount for scopes, with a vintage Weaver K6-1 scope made in the late 1960's. The rifle has no corrosion and the stock just has normal wear and tear.

This is a pre-ban rifle with a BAYONET LUG, and M14/M1A's are no longer manufactured with bayonet lugs, so they are hard to find. The scope is crystal clear and this rifle is deadly accurate.

I am asking $1400 for the rifle, scope, 20 round magazine, and a cleaning kit built-in to the butt stock. Please call or text me at 1-REDACTED for more info.

A slug with an extremely enormous impact effect. When hitting the body, the frontal part of the slug instantly increases from 18.5 to 36-38 mm in diameter – this is the largest slug expansion diameter ever known. It creates an entrance hole with a 3.5 cm diameter, hits powerfully with all its expansion area and disintegrates into six symmetric splinters. The splinter cone causes an extensive area of damage. The unified effect of a hydrodynamic shockwave inside the body, along with splinter damage, ensures an unique instant stopping effect with the Hexolit 32 slug, which provides good results even with imperfect hits.

Hexolit 32 was created by modifying the Dupo 28 slug. During several hunting seasons, research was conducted on slug hit results and their lethal effects. As a result, effective splinter cone damage performance was discovered. When splintering apart, the frontal part of a Hexolit 32 slug causes a powerful double impact. In case of an imperfect hit, the six splinters and main body of a Hexolit 32 slug still provide extensive lethal damage. Some of the splinters reach vital organs and prevent the animal from escaping. Three splinters usually travel up and damage the spine and nerves next to it, paralyzing the animal and denying its possibility to move. Despite its large entrance hole, a Hexolit 32 slug does not cause extensive damage to game animal's meat. The combined and powerful impact effect stops cardiac functions and the circulatory system so quickly that there are no blood effusions usually created by imperfect rifle bullet hits. Thanks to its accuracy and effectiveness, Hexolit 32 is the most efficient ammunition now available. The flawless slug quality complies with the choice of the most demanding hunters.

The pouch holds 4 - 30rd mags, and 4 mags are included in the deal as well.  This shoots nicely - have had no malfunctions in the testing that I have done."

Selling my  stamped reciever fixed stock I.O. AK47. Made in the USA.  It comes with a chrome lined barrel and really smooth Tapco 2 trigger.  I have fired about 200 rounds through it so it is not even broken in. I am anal about my guns so the only negative I can say is that the factory finish on the gun was not great but since its an AK and is going to take a lot of beating I suppose it doesn’t matter but thought I would say it anyways.

Now for the extras. I have added a steel skeleton stock and a recoil pad at a cost of $110.and a Hogue overmolded pistol grip which gives a great grip. I also bought an additional safety with a notch cut in it to hold the bolt open when using it at the range to keep the Range officers happy when doing safety checks.

It comes with  a used Wilson Law Enforcement/Military  magazine from a previous AK I owned and 3 30 round Romainian military steel waffle mags which cost me $55. These were brand new and were still in factory oil when I purchased them and are in excellent shape. 

I have some ammo too that I will sell at a good price to the buyer .

I have over $750 in this gun and its not a cheap run of the mill AK made up if different parts. .I am in no hurry to sell this so  DON’T MAKE YOURSELF LOOK BAD BY OFFERING ME LESS MONEY.. 


Face To Face only and  FOID/ bill of sale a must. I am not willing to drive to sell this."

The Nikon Buckmasters 6-18x40mm Riflescope is a big improvement on one of the best selling scope lines in America, and that's no simple feat. Tricked out with more features, a cooler look, and the same great low prices, the Nikon 6-18x40 Buckmasters Rifle Scope has a more rounded, sleeker look that allows the scope to become a part of your rifle, not just an addition. Nikon has integrated the same great optics and exceptional light transmission as the current Buckmasters scopes, now up to a full 92%, and wrapped them in a more ergonomic body with 1/8-MOA click, hand-turn reticle adjustments for precise site-ins. Quick-focus eyepieces are also now standard on the Nikon Buckmasters riflescopes, as is the non-reflective, matte black finish. The Nikon Buck Masters Riflescope long range models, which previously utilized adjustable objective lenses, are now fitted with a side-focus adjustment knob to compensate for parallax. This feature allows the shooter fast, inconspicuous adjustments-and reduces the overall length of these scopes, as well. The Nikon 6-18 x 40 Buckmaster riflescopes feature durable 1"" main body tubes constructed of aircraft grade aluminum. Nikon Buckmasters scopes are O-ring sealed and nitrogen-filled for true waterproof, fogproof and shockproof performance and are backed by Nikon's Lifetime Full Warranty.

The Soviet 5.45×39mm cartridge is a rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge. It was introduced into service in 1974 for use with the new AK-74 assault rifle. It gradually supplemented then largely replaced the 7.62x39mm round in service.

Info below from Wikipedia

The 5.45×39mm is an example of an international tendency towards relatively small sized light weight military service cartridges. Cartridges like the Russian 5.45×39mm, 5.56×45mm NATO and Chinese 5.8×42mm allow a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight compared to their larger and heavier predecessor cartridges and produce relatively low bolt thrust and free recoil, favouring light weight arms design and automatic fire accuracy."

I have a very unique and exceptionally hard to come by Shernic Gunworks SKS bullpup. These are a year and a half wait now...and not looking to lessen anytime soon.
The SKS is a Chinese Parade (Police Dress?). Orignial woods stock, 10 round fixed magazine with spike bayonet. (inclouded).
The addons are the Shernic Bullpup stock, an SKS Magadapter (takes tapco 20 round mags with duck bill removed - straight in straight out mag changes like an AR) 4 tapco magazines are included. 2 modified for adapter, 2 stock 20rnd (I havent Modified them yet but this can be done with a dremel and modified mags as a template in about 10 minutes for both)
The front tri-rail is in place however, the rails have not shipped form shernic as they are behind production. I will pass them on if they come, but i bought a MagPul MOE 3 inch section and am going to use it instead. It too will come with rifle.
So for this price you get the original stock, mag, bayonet, Chinese chest rig and NC star stripper clips, plus the 4 tapco mags (20 bucks a piece-modified were 25 a pece), sks mag adapter (100 buck new), Tri-rail mount, MOE rail with mounting hardware and all the pieces to adjust and work on or remove the Shernic kit.
The total cost is pushing a grand. I have put around 300 rounds through SKS total since i bought it 11 years ago. It was meant to be a knock about gun but it sat in my closet till i put the Shernic on it. Now im back to not playing with it since i bought an MSAR bullpup.
Trades i may consider are low end AR 15 in 223 or 5.45x39.
Will entertain other assault rifles in those calibres or in 7.62x39 or 7.62x25 or whatever. If you have good ar for trade i can add an EOTech 512 brand new (bought for this rifle cost me 450...you have something that catches my eye...ill toss it in). Im pretty easy goin so dont be afraid to offer something interesting.Selling cause i am merely looking to move onto new toy."

With a name like Kimber you know they held no punches in design, backed by the best customer service in the industry you just can't go wrong with these guns. No games played here, the gun is like new in box, has had maybe 100 rounds through it. Comes with the original stuff, box, 6 round magazine, padded Kimber zippered case, lock, instructions, etc... also included is a set of custom hardwood presentation grips, an extra set of stainless grip screws, a Galco Holster fit to this gun, and a full box of Hornady 124gr. Tap ammunition (that's worth $20 right there). The original grips and grip screws will of course be included. Everything is still crisp and in break in period, some things are still sticky and like any new gun you will want to run some rounds through it to get all the systems working 100% reliable. The only blemish on this gun can be seen in the pictures, a very light surface abrasion forward of the trigger guard at a slight angle. It doesn't even go clear through the finish but just making sure everything is disclosed."

The Walther® P22 is a user-friendly adaptation of the larger P99. The same look. The same feel. Only three quarters of the size of its big brother. But this little guy loads rimfire .22 LR rounds in double action for the first round, and single action for remaining rounds until the magazine is empty. Unleashing the first round is easy with only about 12 pounds of pressure required to activate the double action and emptying the magazine is even easier with single action requiring just under 5 pounds of pressure.  
The double/single action is due to its external hammer, a change from the P99. Decocking the Walther® P22 after activating single action mode can be done by turning on the ambidextrous, slide-mounted safety with your thumb, preventing the hammer from firing the round when the trigger is pulled to release the hammer.
Of course, firing the Walther® P22 to begin with is impossible without a magazine locked firmly in place. This is because of the P22’s magazine disconnect safety feature. Without a magazine firmly in, the trigger bar passes beneath the P22’s lockwork due to pressure from the disconnect spring. The force of the disconnect spring also functions in the rapid ejection of a cleared magazine when released. Magazine ejection is triggered by an ambidextrous lever located behind and below the trigger of the Walther® P22."

Boat is 95', motor is 94'
Includes galv trailer and spare wheels/tires. 
500lbs capacity (on label)

Bad:
Trailer is ok but could use some TLC, new fenders, lights, maybe some touch-up paint. Tires are smaller (no 70mph) and pretty dried out. Rope on winch kinda ratty but it works. It was used in salt water and it shows around some old screw holes inside but it is aluminum so corrosion damage doesn't ""grow"". Easily repaired with some all-metal filler.

Good:
Boat is a standard V-point aluminum standard gauge hull w/deck on front and modified custom aluminum seat mounts making a great front seat for 2-person setup. Carb. rebuild 2/2012, new bearings in trailer 4/2011.
New bunk boards, support brackets, and bunk carpet 6/2010 - and never went in the water after that. Motor has great compression and starter upgrade, works fine. Till steer but has tube for steering kit. I installed trolling motor mount/wiring up front as well to turn this into a real fishing boat. Comes with a cover, washout clamp, touch-up paint, and IF asking price is paid...
I may even throw in a second battery and front mount trolling motor I have, a Minnkota32lb hand steer. Also, a solar trickle charger panel made for charging 12v batteries as well, no controller, amorphous).

 Since the introduction of Hornady’s new .17 caliber rimfire cartridge several months ago, the little hotshot has really caught on with shooters and varmint hunters. Besides Hornady, other ammo makers have now jumped aboard, and several companies are now making rifles chambered for the little seventeen. Gunblast has been a proponent of the seventeen since its introduction. It has proven to be an accurate and flat-shooting cartridge, and works extremely well within its intended purpose. The nay-sayers who predicted that it would not catch on are now eating the crow upon which the .17 HMR is so effective. The little .17 is here to stay. REDACTED"

I'd prefer to just sell it but I suppose I'm always open to trades.   Semi-auto hanguns, rifles in 556/5.45x39/7.62x39, and shotguns with barrels of 20'' or less are really the only type of guns that interest me though."

The action cocks on closing, and does not have the third safety lug, and straight bolt handle Original production was by Mauser, but the Swedes soon set up their own production line at the Carl Gustaf arsenal. The rifle continued in Swedish military service until the 1950's. In 1938 they introduced a short rifle with turned down bolt handle called the Model 1938. This is the most desirable of the Swedish rifles because of its handy size and turned down bolt handle. This rifle is in fine condition with over 95% of the original bluing remaining. The bore is good with sharp riflings. All the numbered parts match. The stock is the typical straight grained Swedish hard wood. The Swedish rifles have a reputation for high standards of manufacture, and for accuracy. There was a crack in the top hand guard that was glued. A flash suppressor is attached in one photo. The Model 1938 is one of the harder ones to find."

 Primarily with the US Secret Service. They used the 7mm Rem Mag for a good number of years using ammo loaded by HSM. The Secret Service eventually migrated to the 300 Win Mag and since then the 7mm has really only been minimally used in the snipng community though it is a favorite of hunters and competitors.

 The 7mm doesn't kick as much but it shoots lighter bullets than the .300, though some of them have very high BC's which allows it to do well at longer ranges. With the right ammo, the 0-1000 meter ballistics are VERY impressive and the 7mm is easily capable of 1000 meter shooting,  in most regards while significantly outpacing the .308 (Which really shouldn't surprise anyone). The Remington 700P was available for a while chambered in the 7mm Rem Mag, but beyond that there are not a lot of sniper rifle options available that are not custom built rifles. Luckily HSM still loads the excellent 7mm 168gr match load that the Secret Service used and it is available for purchase as is a 168gr Berger and 162gr Amax load which both will rival the A191 300 WM load. 

Recommendation:The 7mm is recommended for military applications out to 1000+ meters. But keep in mind she kicks more than the .308 and is harder on barrels, but is a nice compromise between the 308 and 300 Win Mag. Because the 7mm shoots the lighter bullets at higher velocities, it is better suited to the law enforcment arena than the .300"

Manuf. info:

USP Compact

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.
