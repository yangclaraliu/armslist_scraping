Taurus PT845 .45ACP
Posted by Chris Christian. Author Archive » 

Based on a pistol for the US Armed Forces but with a “strike two” capability!



When the United States Special Operations Command announced that it was considering adopting a new service handgun, and laid down the performance requirements for the pistol, a number of handgun makers responded. The result was several new handgun designs that, in light of the postponement of the SOCOM tests, have now been made available to the civilian market.

One was the Taurus 24/7 OSS. As a full-sized service handgun it’s proven to be rugged and reliable. But it’s a bit much to pack concealed on a daily basis. Taurus responded by taking some of the ergonomic features of the 24/7 OSS, adding a few innovations, trimming the size and weight, and introduced a new line of mid-sized semi-auto handguns. The result was the Taurus 800 Series that was introduced in 2008. It is available in 9mm (PT809, 17+1) .40 (PT840, 15+1) and .45ACP (PT845, 12+1). For our test we had the big bore .45ACP model.

The PT845 .45ACP is built on a polymer frame with either a forged steel slide with a black Tennifer finish, or a stainless steel slide. My test model wore the Tennifer finish. A captive recoil spring with a full-length stainless steel guide rod mated with a bushingless barrel to complete the upper unit.

The empty weight is a relatively light 28.2 ounces. The ramped barrel measures 4 inches, providing an overall length of 8.25 inches, a height of 6-inches, and a width of 1.14 inches. An integral rail allows for easy mounting of light or laser. Capacity is 12+1. 

Ergonomics
Noted pistolsmith Wayne Novak, who made a career out of customizing concealed carry handguns, once observed that a good carry pistol “should feel like a well used bar of soap.” It has become an overused cliché, but I can’t find a better way to describe the way the PT845 comes into my hand. 

The backstrap features Taurus’ aggressive ribbed checkering, while the rear portion of the side panels are smooth. The ribbed pattern continues on the front portion of the side panels and wraps around the front strap, where two slight projections create a subtle finger groove effect. Right and left side memory grooves channel the trigger finger to the proper position. When my hand contacts the gun in the holster a proper shooting grip is automatically achieved. 

Complementing that is a nicely undercut triggerguard that has the sharp lower edge relieved. I own several makes of polymer framed pistols and shoot them regularly. All required some attention with a Dremel tool to smooth the triggerguard edge. That wasn’t necessary with the PT845. It’s a very comfortable pistol.

Three interchangeable backstraps of different sizes are supplied. They are changed by drifting out a solid retaining pin at the lower portion of the backstrap, which also serves as a lanyard loop, and sliding a different size insert into place. I have average-sized hands and the backstrap that arrived on the gun was an excellent fit for me, so I felt no need to try the other two sizes. 

Firing Mechanism
Taurus notes that the PT845 was derived from the Taurus 24/7 OSS series, but the firing mechanism is quite a bit different. This is not a striker-fired, internal hammer pistol. A slide mounted inertia-type firing pin provides the primer blow. This is a traditional DA/SA design with an external hammer and has repeat strike capability. In the same manner as the CZ-75 or the Beretta Tomcat, the gun can be carried with the hammer in three different positions. When the hammer is fully lowered it provides a lengthy DA pull with a slight, but noticeable, stacking at the rear of the stroke. My Lyman Digital Trigger Pull Gauge says the pull is 10.5 pounds. Ease the hammer back slightly, to what amounts to a quarter-cock position, and about half of the trigger pull length is turned into take-up slack. The pull weight remains the same but the pull length is significantly reduced.

With the hammer in the SA mode the pull weight is a relatively crisp 6.5 pounds with only a suggestion of creep. The trigger is smooth faced and nicely rounded.

A frame-mounted ambidextrous safety allows the gun to be carried DA or SA (cocked and locked) and the safety can be engaged to block the trigger in each hammer position. The frame-mounted safety has a third position that also serves as a decocking mechanism. With the safety engaged in the up position, depressing it to the middle position disengages it. Push it further down to the third position and it decocks the pistol. The PT845 also includes an internal firing pin block that prevents the firing pin from moving forward until the trigger has been moved to its final rearward position.

Completing the operating controls are ambidextrous slide and magazine releases. A loaded chamber indicator peeks out from the upper side of the extractor when a round is chambered.

The PT845 does not have a magazine disconnect safety, and will fire with the magazine removed. The double stack magazines are solidly made with right side witness holes at 6 and 12 rounds and are a drop-free design. A finger extension base plate provides a comfortable rest for the support hand and also makes magazine insertion very positive. A magazine loading tool is provided, but I didn’t need it. Finger power alone was enough to easily get all 12 rounds into each of the two supplied magazines.

Sights are a three white dot pattern and are drift adjustable for windage. Both front and rear are dovetailed into the slide and securely retained via an Allen screw. They are cut a bit taller than many other sights and allow a generous amount of light around the front sight. I found them very quick to acquire.

The PT845 arrived in a foam-lined pad lockable case with two magazines, a bristle bore brush, magazine loading tool, two additional interchangeable backstraps, and two keys to activate the Taurus Security System lock, which is located on the rear portion of the lower right rear grip panel.

Range Time
Prior to heading out to my backyard range I did a quick field strip and added oil to the appropriate points. A Bianchi Model 7 Shadow II three-slot pancake holster for the Glock 29/30 was an excellent fit for the Taurus. So, I headed out to the range with the PT845 and holster.

Test ammunition included 230-grain Winchester Target/Range FMJ, Federal’s 230-grain Hydra-Shok and 165-grain EFMJ, Hornady’s 185-grain Custom XTP JHP, Remington’s 230-grain Golden Saber, and my 230-grain LRN match reload. I also had a hundred 185-grain lead semi-wadcutter reloads of dubious heritage that I figured would be a good test for feeding, so they were included.

Working from the holster, my initial shooting was no more complex than ringing some hanging plates and bouncing empty beverage cans from the 10- to 15-yard mark. The gun proved to be a natural pointer that came quickly to hand. And, even with full power 230-grain loads, it was very controllable and soft shooting.

The gun fed everything that went into the magazine (even the 185-grain LSWC reloads) and case ejection was smooth and consistent. 

Once I had about 200 rounds through the gun I settled down on a 15-yard sandbag rest, shooting SA, for accuracy tests. The PT845 was not a fan of swaged lead reloads, but did have an affinity for jacketed fodder. The 230-grain loads showed the best accuracy, as is often the case with the .45ACP, but lighter bullet weights proved more than accurate enough for self-defense tasks. 

Timed Drills
Plinking, bench rest accuracy tests, and a few basic handling drills can tell you a lot about how a pistol will perform, but they don’t give me as clear a picture as does running the gun under some degree of stress or at the least, running timed drills against the clock. An IDPA or USPSA match would have been a nice test, but with only two magazines in hand it wasn’t in the cards. Instead, I ran some of my basic practice drills with my PACT III Club Timer. I have been running these drills for years and know what my normal PAR time/score is with whichever of my match guns I’m running.

The first test was three IDPA targets set up 6 feet apart at 7 yards. The drill is simple: at the buzzer, draw and double tap each target. I ran this ten times with 230-grain Winchester Target/Range full power ball ammo. The first two runs were 4.46 and 4.27 seconds respectively. The next eight runs were between 3.93 and 3.67 seconds. The second drill is a single IDPA target at 7 yards, two to the chest and one to the head. Ten runs produced times of 2.41 to 2.33 seconds.

The times on the first drill were within a half-second of my normal time with my match-tuned .45ACP, while the times on the second drill were almost identical. The scores were not quite as good. I had a tendency to drop the first round a bit low and out of the 0-zone with the DA pull, but follow-up shots were on the mark with the gun in the SA mode. That, however, is comparing a stock, out-of-the-box, DA/SA semi-auto in a high ride concealed carry holster against a match tuned semi-auto with a crisp 3.5-pound trigger, fiber optic sights, handloads softer than full power ball, and from a straight drop Blade-Tech competition holster. 

Final Notes
Well over 300 rounds went downrange in this test. They included bullet weights from 230 to 165 grains, as well as some dubious semi-wadcutter reloads. The only malfunctions were my operator errors with the thumb safety. Once the basic tests were done, I cleaned the gun, stuffed it with Federal Hydra-Shoks, and carried it for two weeks in place of the compact 9mm that’s my normal carry gun. I found it to be every bit as comfortable to carry. That’s a lot to ask from a pistol that packs 12+1 rounds of .45ACP, but the PT845 delivered.

Both mags will be fully loaded with ammo.

It is in a like new condition. 

The AS trigger system of the Walther P99 has three possible carry modes: 

AS Mode The first is the AS mode which will automatically engage after a round is chambered. The trigger is fully forward, as if in double action, but the striker indicator is to the rear and visible. This mode offers the safety of carrying the P99 AS in single action with a light yet long trigger pull. 

DA Mode The second mode is Double Action. After a round is chambered, the decocking button can be depressed, releasing the striker into a double action trigger pull. In this mode the trigger is fully forward and the striker is at rest and no longer visible to the rear of the slide. After the trigger is first pulled, all subsequent shots will be in single action. This mode is considered, among fellow P99 AS owners, to be the safest mode to carry the AS in. 

SA Mode The third mode of carry for the P99 AS is Single Action. This mode can be achieved by chambering a round into the AS mode, then slowly pulling the trigger to the rear until you hear the SA portion of the sear engage. There will be an audio able click and the trigger will remain in the rear position. This mode will also automatically engage after the first trigger pull in double action mode. 


The barrel and slide have been hardness treated in the same manner that Glock has been, but Walther calls it by another trade name than Tennifer. 

I would like to trade for Walther P99C. Roind count at 200. No low ball offers please. 

Will trade for: Walther P99C, PPS, XDM, Kimber, Sig, HK, Beretta Inox, Judge (+/- cash as needed)

This is the COMPLETE IZHMASH / Mikhail Kalashnikov collection of Saiga AK-47 platform shotguns and rifles.  It has taken me almost a year to collect this entire collection.  I have purchased almost all of these from Federal Firearms Licensed dealers.  Since these are/were in high demand, it was impossible to find them all in one place.

From Wiki:  The Saiga Semi-Automatic Rifles are a family of Russian semi-automatic rifles manufactured by Izhmash, who also manufacture the original AK-series assault rifles and SVD sniper rifles. The Saiga rifles are a so-called ""sportier"" version of the AK-series rifles, and are marketed for hunting and civilian use.

As far as I know I am the original owner of this rifle, my girlfriend bought it for me unfired and NIB a year ago but she recently bought me an AK47 as well for an anniversary gift.
This SKS has all matching numbers, a laminated stock, Tula star and arrow, manufactured 1952 and imported by KBI Industries, it is a refurbished rifle but all numbers match inside and out, making it a completely rebuilt rifle with all new parts, I have only fired it twice for a total of 80 rounds with non corrosive ammo and cleaned it thoroughly afterward.

It will come with the original factory 10 round magazine, the 30 round pictured is just what I had in it that day for the cool factor.

I am currently looking mostly for AK47 stuff like a quad rail, foregrip, laser, etc, I am also interested in trading for either a Sig 522 or an AR15 in .22 LR or a Century Arms AK74 in 5.45x39, which I see as going for about 350-400ish, I would prefer a metal/aluminum handguard for my AK but will consider anything with a bottom rail, my AK is an underfolder so please do not offer stocks of any kind or Tapco products.

Will consider other guns on trade, generally I discourage handguns as I'm only 20 so don't offer them unless you're up for that trade, it isn't illegal but I know a lot of people have reservations and trust issues I suppose, I turn 21 in October so it isn't that far off and I have a clean background, just a disclaimer so you're not wasting your time and then getting an attitude because I'm not 21.

I currently can't drive far from the Sedalia area because my truck is having transmission problems, long drives just exacerbate it terribly and I really do not want to risk being stranded somewhere.

Also, please do not spam my email inbox, I am a fairly busy person and will get back to you when I can, no email will go unanswered but it's rude to send multiple ones in a row.

Again, no cash offers please, I am not desperate to sell or get rid of this gun, I'm simply looking to focus on my AK47 for now as I would rather have one dedicated rifle that I know inside and out than an entire safe full of rifles that I barely shoot.

I also have a Tapco T6 telescoping stock and 30 round detachable magazine that feeds flawlessly for this rifle, but you will need a couple of 922r compliance parts to accompany it, it was a project I never got around to finishing.

You can text me at 1-REDACTED, I do not answer phone calls from numbers I do not recognize.

Thank you for reading, have a good day."

Model: Mini-14/5
Shipped: May 2000

The wood furniture, including the top wood hand guard, which is no longer produced by Ruger is in beautiful condition. I currently have 2 other Mini's

There has only been approximately 400 rds down the tube, 
no problems, it runs fine. The rear sight is of the older standard 
design Ruger put out basically a small peep sight flip. However
the flip part has been removed to allow the scope mount to fit.
the flip part is not included, but replacement can easily be found 
in Midway, Ruger USA, etc... if so desired.

It is not the gun I want to compete with, since I'm not very good yet, and the 1911 has a limited capacity in .45ACP and costs more to reload.  The picture shows a Hogue grip, but I also have the original grips, as well as the case, user manual, bushing wrench, and the original two S&W 8-round mags.  I also have an 8-round ACT-Mag, an 8-round CMC Powermag, a 7-round Rock Island GI-style mag, and four 10-round CMC Powermags.  I also have a Blade-Tech Tek-Lok holster, two Blade-Tech Tek-Lok double mag pouches, and a black leather Don Hume double mag pouch.  Cash price of $950 for all of it.

Trades considered would be a 1911 in .40SW or 9mm, a Glock 34 or 35, or an M&P Pro in .40SW or 9mm.  The Glock or M&P would have to have the same setup in the way of holster and mag pouches and a comparable supply of magazines, and may still require some cash.  Preference given toward Glocks."

Rugers classifies it as a Standard Mini 14, of which not too commonly
found, since Ruger had already started the Ranch Rifle model of the Mini.
Further information on the rifle is Ruger shows it as 

Model: Mini-14/5
Shipped: May 2000

The wood furniture, including the top wood hand guard, which is no longer produced by Ruger is in beautiful condition. I currently have 2 other Mini's 
so I don't really need a third one, which is why I am offering this rifle for Trade or Sale. 

There has only been approximately 400 rds down the tube, 
no problems, it runs fine. The rear sight is of the older standard 
design Ruger put out basically a small peep sight flip. However
the flip part has been removed to allow the scope mount to fit.
the flip part is not included, but replacement can easily be found 
in Midway, Ruger USA, etc... if so desired.

The Mini 14 will come with the following;

1- 20rd Mag and 
1- 5rd Mag
New John Masen Muzzle Brake 
BEC INC Miradot 1x20m Red Dot Scope including mount
Nice basic Black Tactical case with it 
Older Ram-Line folding synthetic stock or Tapco Intrafuse Collapsible stock (Buyers choice) 


I would like to trade more so, but will sell if need be.

I am interested in Full Size Beretta 92FS or 1911 (No Glocks) or Military Rifles
doesn't hurt to make a offer, all I could do is politely decline...

The gun has never had a failure whatsoever with various types of ammo from Speer Gold Dot, Hornady Critical Defense and a wide variety of ball ammo.

I am the original owner. The gun has a Ghost Rocket 3.5 trigger bar reset installed and polished internals. The trigger pull is as close to a 1911 as a striker fired pistol can get. It is smooth, breaks clean and has no over-travel at all. I am yet to meet anyone who was not impressed by this trigger.

I am selling this pistol because I will only carry a self-defense pistol without a manual safety and my other pistols do not have a manual safety. If this pistol was offered without a manual safety it would be my everyday carry.

Also included are the original case, 10 and 17 round magazines, pistol lock, the original trigger bar and a Don Hume OWB JIT Slide Holster.

They are fair, with outstanding products, and excellent, personal service.

Also, there is no fee for credit cards.

Beretta is discontinuing the 90-Two line.  These are outstanding firearms.  I believe their decision is based on a poor marketing decision in naming these firearms and creating confusion with the 92 series.  My guess is that you will see this resurrected with another name.

 Both mags will be fully loaded with ammo.

 It is in a like new condition. 

The AS trigger system of the Walther P99 has three possible carry modes: 

AS Mode The first is the AS mode which will automatically engage after a round is chambered. The trigger is fully forward, as if in double action, but the striker indicator is to the rear and visible. This mode offers the safety of carrying the P99 AS in single action with a light yet long trigger pull. 

DA Mode The second mode is Double Action. After a round is chambered, the decocking button can be depressed, releasing the striker into a double action trigger pull. In this mode the trigger is fully forward and the striker is at rest and no longer visible to the rear of the slide. After the trigger is first pulled, all subsequent shots will be in single action. This mode is considered, among fellow P99 AS owners, to be the safest mode to carry the AS in. 

SA Mode The third mode of carry for the P99 AS is Single Action. This mode can be achieved by chambering a round into the AS mode, then slowly pulling the trigger to the rear until you hear the SA portion of the sear engage. There will be an audio able click and the trigger will remain in the rear position. This mode will also automatically engage after the first trigger pull in double action mode. 


The barrel and slide have been hardness treated in the same manner that Glock has been, but Walther calls it by another trade name than Tennifer. 

I would like to trade for Walther P99C. Roind count at 200. No low ball offers please.

The 120 was pretty much a budget version of the Winchester 1200 and since Winchester stood to make more money off the 1200 and 1300 line they discontinued the Ranger 120.
It was a small number produced, I hear varying estimates, 5,000 and 20,000 that were made.
It's not the production that makes a gun expensive, it's the notoriety as well.
This one isn't a Ducks Unlimited shotgun.

There is some loss of surface behind the front grip on the tube magazine, one scratch and some dents on the butt stock but that's it.
It is a 12 gauge chambered for 2 3/4"" and 3"" with a 28"" barrel with removable modified choke, has leather sling as well.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game. Regular price $550, today.......$475 Plus tax

Numbers do not match. Has always fired and is as accurate as these old service pistols get. The safety does work but you need to pull the hammer back all the way to use it.

Ballester Molinas uses mags, barrels, swinging link, link pin, barrel bushing, recoil spring plug, recoil spring, and recoil spring guide that interchange with the 1911.

This is a good entry level 45 and includes an extra mag and spare extractor. Asking $350 or will consider trade for decent home defense shotgun.

This is an actual Dragunov built at the Izhmach factory, with a 21 in barrel and 1 in 9.4 in. rifling for the stabilizing of heavier bullets. Needless to say these are getting harder to find and the asking prices lately have been absurd. Here is one practically new at a realistic price. I have sold several of these over my time of collecting, and am willing to provide referrences to ease the minds of buyers.

The rifle appears to be unfired except for factory testing, and there is only one ejection mark on the dust cover. Even on the magazine there is no evidence of having ever been loaded and the only scrape is from the bolt carrier sliding over it.

The finish is perfect with only a couple of dings here and there and a few on the front sight base. There is very little wear on the slide areas where the bolt carrier would travel.

The stock has a couple of small dings from handling, but nothing appears to have gone past the finish.

Overall it is in excellent condition at the very least
Comes with one 5 round magazine.
