I am not looking to gouge anyone's wallet so I am looking to trade for fair value. Here is what I have:

First I have three 33 round aftermarket Glock 17/19 magazines. These are not the crappy korean imports, these are the ones in the plain brown wrapper you used to be able to pick up from Cabellas. They are still in new shape. drop free, run fine, and have only been used twice. 

Second I have three 30 rounds Steel SKS magazines. They have only been ran once without any issues, and are in great shape. 

I am looking to trade for AR15 pmags, Polymer AR15 mags, or a quality pocket pistol in 380. I wont be trying to get a ridiculous amount in trade for these, but I also will not be trading them for the value they were 4 months ago either. Let me know what you have and maybe we can make a deal. All offers welcome.

I bought this car 9+ years ago and put 210,000 miles on it.  It has been a VERY reliable car for me with NO major engine or transmission problems.  I was driving this car 650 miles a week until the end of December and wouldn’t hesitate to drive this car anywhere.  I intended on getting 300,000+ miles out of it but ran across a great deal on another car.  I have tried to honestly/ accurately summarize the car below, please read carefully and contact me with any questions.  This Saturn would make a great work car, new driver’s vehicle, inexpensive winter car, etc.
Options and features are:
1.9L DOHC engine; still has good power and averages 31-33mpg highway but uses some oil (very common in these engines).  Had timing chain, water pump, serpentine belt and tensioner (preventative and not due to failure) all replaced this past summer.
 4 speed automatic transmission shifts well, fluid and filter changed about 4 months ago.
Tires are great quality Dunlop Signatures, 60,000-mile-tire in very good condition and are less than a year old.
4 wheel ABS and traction control system work well 
Front brakes were just redone with new pads and rotors less than 2 months ago (Nov 2012).  Rear brake pads were replaced about 3 years ago.
Battery was replaced 1.5 years ago
Radio w/CD player works
Power windows/locks and passengers side mirror, tilt wheel, and driver’s seat has manual lumbar and height adjustments.  Power window on driver’s side rear does not work but can be replaced for about $30.
Heating system works well and has rear passenger floor vents.  Air conditioning worked until last summer but holds refrigerant pressure. It might just need a drain and recharge but I am unsure.
Front and rear bumpers in body paint color, rear spoiler and alloy wheels
Rear 60/40 folding seats for added trunk/cargo room
Rear window defrost works
Nearly new (might have been used once, don’t remember) spare tire and jack
Haynes Saturn repair manual included

A few minor negatives:
Driver’s side panels have minor sideswipe damage. The damagehas NO effect on driving or operation of doors and is strictly cosmetic!  The beauty of Saturn’s plastic panels, they flex and resist dents.
Power moon roof leaked and was disabled. The interior headliner has some water damage as a result. The moon roof  was caulked in place with silicone."

Here is a unique opportunity to own one sweet custom ATV/Tractor/Log hauler or whatever kind of toy you want to call it. This was made to hunt moose up north. Everything is very neat and custom. The machine and fabrication work is quality and factory look Precise welds and cuts. 

Volvo B18 engine with the 2 SU carbs , with the M20 4 speed Volvo trans and clutch coupled to a GM 4 speed trans with a well made custom transfer case that drives the front and rear Chev HO 4.56:1 solid axles. THis gives you a perfect 4 speed with 4 different ranges. The trans has a PTO that drives a winch mounted up front. Also has front shaft in which you could run other equipment off of the PTO. The steering is completely hydraulic with all new components and lines that run to the front and rear hydraulic rams. There is a switch panel with ign. key switch,switches and gauges for oil and fluid pressures. The frame is well made and houses the oil for the hydraulics. There is a drive shaft brake lever operated as an ebrake. The brakes are drums Chev.on all on all 4 wheels but are not hooked up yet to the master cylinder. The tall tractor tires are mounted on custom rims said to be of aircraft origin. There is another set of wheels and tires that go along with the package, that aid in transportation. Actually thought lower wheels would be great if you are not at all into the monster truck look. Dually wheels on both axles would be great. ITs a versatile machine that can have many uses. The Winch is awesome with all new cable.

Pull logs out, run a log splitter, put a snow plow on it, build a custom cab over it and have the best looking and versatile 4 wheeler. ITs more then a 4 wheeler and there is very expensive components that went into this. A true workhorse that will last you a long time. I have got this sweet machine running and all the hydraulics hooked up. Very little to do. I think it might be possible with Street tires to customize it for street use. Like a homebuilt/experimental automobile. Not sure about that but it has many other uses besides that.

For licensing purposes I think you get a motorcycles endorsement and cruise as a three wheeler I am told. YOu could make a great icecream scooter, vending scooter, or just have cool conversation toys fun to work on and cruise. WOuld also make a great farm errand runner. 

Should check out youtube video of what a westcoaster is and here are a few links:

1. First Trike is a westcoaster van model. Very collectable and restorable. Also known as a mailster. The motor has been dissassembled and ready to re-ring and get on your way. Complete 3 speed transmission, bellhousing, rearend, drivelines. Should have enough there to have something really cool. Even have both door. The nice thing is the space. YOu can put 3 of these in your garage. Also be first in line at the ferry docks and always have a supreme parking spot. Fiberglass is all there needs some work but its in great condition considering how long its been around. 

2. Second Trike is a Westcoaster pickup model. The onan motor has been dissassembled and ready to re-ring and get on your way. Complete 3 speed transmission, bellhousing, rearend, drivelines. Should have enough there to have something really cool. The fiberglass cab does need quite a bit of work as it was abused before I got it. But there is enough there to fix and restore it. Or make an open trike without the cab. Although I think its' worth more as a true westcoaster.

Last 2 pictures are one of another westcoaster in portland for sale and the other is a cool looking foreign Mazda mini truck. The second westcoaster would no doubt make an awesome custom minitruck.

I keep it very low key and comfortable as the class portion is done out of my home in Lexington.  Usual class size is 5 or 6 people, so everyone has plenty of time to ask questions and still cover all the required material.  Class usually starts at 9am, and the shooting portion ends around 6 or 7pm so plan on an all day event.  Usually we order Pizza for lunch.  Coffee, water, and donuts are provided on the day of class.  ALSO....the price shown includes both sets of fingerprint cards completely filled out.  Basically at the end of the day the only thing you have to do is put a $50 money order in the envelope that we'll provide you with along with your application and copies that we'll make in class and mail it in.  Doesn't get much simpler than that.  I don't have a specific date set up as of right now for my next class, but if interest is shown I can quickly put one together.

Everything else was replaced with colt, fusion, and wilson combat parts. The trigger, thumb saftey, slide stop, and trigger parts are colt. Mainspring housing, hammer, firing pin, and beavertail safety are wilson combat parts. Guide rod, and extractor are fusion parts. 

The pistol was duracoated inside and out. Layed extra thick on the rails for a tight frame to slide fit. EGW sights were installed and wrap around grip. 

Of all my 1911s this one feels the best in my hands. Unfortunally I dont shoot it enough so it has to go. Has had about 3 mags through it since it was built. Shoots great and locks up solid. Will come with 1 7rd mag."

   I am a sportsman and avid target shooter residing in your district. The recent political climate regarding firearm restrictions greatly concerns me.  The overwhelming attacks on our 2nd Amendment Rights To Keep and Bear Arms in the wake of The Sandy Hook shootings is not only in poor taste but also shameful and an attack on our way of life.  Facts have proven that violence is not dependent on guns alone.  It takes a violent or unstable individual to commit violence.  The violent crimes perpetrated on society typically is at the hands of violent criminals.  The atmosphere these criminals are nurtured in by way of drugs, alcohol, video games, movies etc. are as large or if not, a larger concern.  It is the violence we are bombarded with in society and the substances we are seeing abused that need to be addressed.  Every one I know who owns, respects and uses firearms are responsible and law abiding citizens.  I vote and so do many of my peers. One thing we all have in common is a strong sense of pride in our unalienable rights guaranteed us by way of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, that you have recently took an oath to abide by and uphold.  I believe it is unconstitutional, therefore illegal to restrict any of our rights with out an amendment to the Constitution? 
   Furthermore, I believe the details surrounding the Sandy Hook Shooting are rather vague to say the least.  The methods used to take advantage of that horrible event seem almost intentional by anti gun members of our society.  I question, whether a further deeper investigation into the Sandy Hook Shooting is in order.   There have been an overwhelming amount of inconsistencies in that official story followed by many attempts to silence any efforts to reveal further details. I am far from a conspiracy theorist, just a concerned citizen whom refuses to accept things as they are sometimes suspiciously presented. Especially when they are used in conjunction with an attempt to disarm Americans.
   I respect you, your office and your time Congressman; Therefore I will not waste either your time nor mine.  This is not about hunting, this is about freedom.  I pray you and I can agree that any restriction upon our Second Amendment is an attack upon our freedom and way of life.

Congratulations again and I Thank You for your time.  I look forward to the freedom the founders of our great nation ensured us and that of our children's future in These United States of America.  God Bless, Good Luck.

Whether you are looking for a plinking gun, hunting rifle, or something to introduce a young person to shooting with, this is THE semi-automatic .22 rifle to have. I purchased this particular gun at age 16 and it has served me faithfully ever since (and proved the demise of literally hundreds of varmints). It comes with a Bushnell 4x fixed power scope with weaver rings that has proven reliable season after season. I will include a case, sling, cleaning kit, a 10 rd and 25 rd magazine. I hope to sell this to someone who will enjoy it as much as I have. It has a few light scratches from being in the field, but still functions flawlessly. As for maintenance, I am a Marine, and I always keep my weapons clean. 

I'm asking for $400 for the whole package. I'm also open to trade. Just let me know what you have. 

Transaction will be Face to face, cash only with bill of sale and photo documentation of the deal and all your information. I live in the Kingsland/Saint Mary's area and will meet you at a mutually agreeable location. Contact by email. 

Update: Due to a lot of people not understanding the price, I will itemize it: Here was my methodology. Gun MSRP is $280 though I probably paid more. Scope would be $80. Rings are $25. Mounting and bore sight $35. (pretty standard price from a gunsmith) $25 for the extra mag. $10 for sling. That totals $465. Being that it is in good shape, I'd like to get back most of what I have in it. This is not a panic price nor am I looking to profit. So right now I feel like $400 is fair.

To those of you selling 7.62 x 39 and 9mm and .223 for outrageous prices. Hate to tell you , but Gander and Cabelas is getting this stuff in weekly and selling it for their normal prices. Gander had all popular calibers in stock Friday and there is some still sitting there. $230 for 1000 rounds of 115 grain 9mm. Sportsmans Guide is taking backorders as well.

To those of you selling SKS. Your rifle is not an ""assault rifle"" and is meant to only have a mag capacity of 10 (there are some that take AK mags and are worth more) The duckbills are clumsy and most are not even worth scrap metal. They are not worth over $400 in excellent condition. They are worth even less if numbers aren't matching or you bubba'd them up in plastic stocks and $20 red dot scopes and do not have the original stock. 

Many of you are more concerned about making a quick buck and not concerned about our republicrats and dim-o-whits taking our 2nd Amendment away. I hope you all made enough to buy Marlboros and Miller Lite for a month instead of your usual Pall Malls and Miluakee's Best."

I recently had a new recoil spring and night sights installed ($200 upgrade) I also purchased 2 8rnd flush fitting magazines as seen in the photos from checkmate industries ($80). The Para carry 9 is a great EDC and easy to conceal. For someone who is looking for 1911 ergonomics and feel with DAO and slide saftey this gun will not let you down. Please if you have any questions feel free to email me. I am not in a rush to sell and wont be low balled but serious offers will be entertained. The only reason i am selling this gun is because as i said before i want to (not have to ) upgrade to a.45. Price is $700 OBO.......Thanks for looking!

Tired of the disgustingly priced ARs and ammo prices going up through the roof? Well this is perfect for you. You get the same awesome 416 platform and you're not paying  $4,000 for it. The fact that police and military organizations around the world use these rifles to train their men is enough of a reason to get this beauty, right? If it's good enough for them, it's good enough for you. The fact that it's in .22 saves you even more money. It may be a small round, but still extremely effective. The collapseable stock allows you to fit it in multiple areas so it's not just a range toy. Store in your car or truck and go hunt some grouse, easy to around corners with in tight spaces for situations like home defense, hell this would make a great truck rifle too!

It only has about 142k miles on it and no rust at all with only a couple very small dents that you can almost not even see. The interior is fine but the driver door needs a new panel on it and the coffee holder is broke. it has 31in BF Mudders as well. I have a custom canopy on it right now that has my companies name on it but you could take it off.
I al looking for a full progressive reloading setup and some rifles or hand guns, let me know what you have. I will send pics or put up pics here if I see any interest in trading."
