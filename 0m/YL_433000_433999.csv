The gun has FOUR factory HK mags (8 rds, if you know anything about HK mags, you will know these are about $70 a piece). The gun comes with a blackhawk retention holster, SUPER bright night sights (about 2 1/2 years old), a hogue slip on grip and a USP rail adapter so you can use any light or laser attachment on the rail and the original USP box. The gun does have some holster wear on the slide (it's a 10 year old gun, so it's to be expected). This is the version 1 with only the decocker, not the decocker/safety. I'm am beyond fanatical about maitenence about the gun, even if I go shoot 10 rds through it I break it down and clean every inch of it, and always properly lube it with OTIS CLP.

I also have up for sale or trade are three tactical Remington Shotguns. 

1. Remington 870 Tactical Magnum- 

This amazing shotgun was a limited run for the 2005 Shot Show. They are pretty difficult to find, especially at a fair price. It comes from the factory duracoated in OD green. The magazine tube capacity is 7+1 which is also a factory modification. This shotgun also has the pistol grip. There are a few light knicks and dings but nothing serious. The OD is actual OD green. I know it is difficult to see in the photos, but I assure you, it is OD green. I am asking $525 or best offer. 


2. Remington 870 Wingmaster- 

This 870 has been heavily upgraded and is in great condition. The finish has a bright color and really looks great with the stainless accents. The stock is a tapco intrafuse, molded pistol grip, a railed pump for mounting lights, etc.. It also comes with a forward grip mounted to the pump. When I purchased this shotgun, I changed the barrel to a mossberg brand 18.5 inch door breacher barrel. It also has a side shell holder. The magazine capacity is 4+1, so 8 shells are ready for your disposal. I am asking $400 or best offer.

3. Remington 870- 

This gun has been upgraded with a choate stock which also includes a 5 shell holder incorporated into the stock. The barrel is 18.5 inches long and is also a mossberg door breacher barrel which is a direct replacement for 870's. This gun is in good condition. I am asking $375 or best offer. 

I went on a tactical shotgun kick for quite a while but it is now time for me to move on. I will consider negotiating with a cash buyer that wants to purchase all three. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me. I am interested in some trades but cash is king, so the trade must be worth my while because I need cash more than anything."

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9mm. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot “two-finger grip” frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

All variants of the USP Compact have modified contoured slide and frame for effective concealability. Variants 1-7 also have a no snag, bobbed hammer. The extended slide release is contoured to reduce wear and tear on clothing when the pistol is carried concealed.

Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high energy +P and +P+ loads.

The USP Compact can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action modes and double action only modes. The USP Compact is currently available in four calibers and nine trigger / firing mode configurations, or virtually any firing mode imaginable.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

The frame mounted control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, has a slimline profile for compactness but is still quickly accessible, unlike the slide mounted safeties common on many semiautomatic pistols.

Simple to maintain, the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol with the performance of a full size handgun.

Comes with:

6 mags, Fobus Holster and Duel Mag Holster."

The FN PS90 Triple Rail (TR) gives the operator a wide choice of sighting accessories via its three MIL-STD 1913 rails for mounting optional optical sights, tactical lights and lasers. Chambered in the 5.7x28mm cartridge, the PS90 utilizes straight blowback operation and fires from a closed bolt for greater accuracy and reliability. The PS90’s civilian legal 16.04"" cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel is equipped with an integrated muzzle brake to reduce recoil. Dual magazine latches, cocking handles and an innovative matte black synthetic thumbhole stock with a molded-in sling attachment point help make the PS90 fully ambidextrous.

332,http://www.armslist.com/posts/433332,For Sale:  Pulsar N550,"Northish, Omaha, Nebraska","$ 1,200","Listed On: Thursday, June 14, 2012",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a Pulsar N550 digiscope for sale.  This is an interesting night/day scope with some interesting features.  Firstly, because it digitally enhances the image, there are no photosensitive films like with traditional night vision, meaning it can be used both day and night.  Additionally, because of its digital nature, it can be zeroed in with a single shot.  All you do is activate the one-shot-zero function, fire a round, keep the ""x"" on your point of aim and move the cross hair to the point of impact.  DONE!  It also has a build in IR light to illuminate your target on those extra dark nights!  Oh, and I almost forgot, it has a video out so that you can record everything your scope sees!  This is a really popular scope for nighttime hog hunts!  Has the nice carry bag, all cables and manual.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

I will consider trades, but I am really looking for a new patrol rifle.  I am looking for an LWRC M6A3 and would be willing to pony up cash if your trade is worth more than the scope (which an LWRC M6A3 would of course be, but I mean other trades), so if you have something else, let me know!"

I need to fund some new projects, so I  am selling some stuff cheap, so get in here before someone else does!  As far as what is included, it is pretty much just the goggles and the two battery packs, meaning the larger one that holds two sets of AA batteries and allows you to switch between the two sets, as well as the compact battery pack that takes a single lithium CR123.  There is no Wilcox mount included because mine just recently gave out on me, so I will be pricing it accordingly.  I can include the broken Wilcox if you would like, but I tore it apart pretty good in an attempt to repair it, only to find the damage was in a place that is not easily accessible.  The goggles themselves are still in perfect working order, and the battery packs are as well.  There are two cases as well, one foam lined case that is fitted to the goggles (to keep them super safe), and a smaller one for holding the battery packs and mount (when you get a mount that works).

The tubes are in fantastic condition and have only the tiniest specks of black around the outer edges.  They really aren't noticeable, especially once you have both eyes dialed in together, but I made sure to mention them for the sake of full disclosure.  The clarity and quality are something that can't really be depicted in a single picture because having two tubes means you still have depth perception that can't be shown here.  As other sellers of this fine system have said before, why pay $6500 total for some empty $3500 goggles and two $1500 tubes, when you can buy it all for way less from me.

I am open to trade offers, but really am looking for a new patrol rifle, specifically an LWRC M6A3.  If you have something you think may interest me, please let me know and we can talk."

I have an excellent condition DSA SA-58 FAL pattern rifle. It is unique in that it is one of the first 150 factory rifles that DSA produced, it has the Grayslake marked receiver with carry handle cut. It also has a factory option Badger Ordnance 21in heavy barrel and was MFG'd as shown with factory serial number verification of this configuration. I have added the DSA extreme duty scope mount but will include the original dust cover. This is an extremely rare rifle, and the reason I am willing to part with it is that I actually like to shoot my rifles and would hate to lower the value of this firearm with a high round count. I would be willing to trade for an arsenal ak in 556 with accessories... let me know whatcha got!

THIS IS NOT YOUR AVERAGE GUN SHOP VARIETY 91/30. It is a Izhevsk/Izhmash ""Izzy"" arsenal produced rifle. This is a Dragoon that was converted into a 91/30 in Russia when they had a surplus of Dragoons and switched over to making 91/30's. This has the hexagonal receiver, ALL numbers match including the receiver, bolt, magazine floor plate, and stock. The bore still has good rifling and it has NOT been counter bored. It is a very low original serial number - its serial number is just 386. What also makes this gun rare is the double striking of the Russian writing on the receiver. The top line was partially double struck in production. This rifle is also old enough that it doesn't have the standard ""arrow inside a triangle"" factory Izhevsk/Izhmash logo, it has the old style bow and arrow logo. There are several lines of Russian text on the receiver as well as the hammer and sickle emblem. This is a great addition to any collection. You will not find many others like this out there anywhere. Has original tool pouch, tools, cleaning rod, sling w/ Russian markings, oil bottle, bayonet and ammo pouch. I also have 20 rounds of ammunition to go with it.

I put less than 250 rounds through it and decided I could use something different. This is more of a hunting shotgun (ducks/turkey maybe?) and I'm not a hunter. I'm getting into skeet and trap so I think I'll get an over/under. I'll get a pump for home defense too.
Anyway, I've had it about a year now and only shot skeet with it once. I put a rail on the top which can be easily taken off. The screws ended up clamping down on the barrel, so when I went to take if off I ended up having to hammer out the barrel which marred the barrel some. Its not bad, but I wanted to be upfront. I put a picture if it in the album. The problem is fixed now and the rail can stay or go easily.
This shotgun is designed for 3"" and 3.5"" shells but I have been able to get the 2 3/4"" to cycle. From what I've read, once you get done with the break in period the 2 3/4 shells will cycle just fine. Just note I'm not out of the break-in round count yet.
I still have the factory chokes, buttstock spacers and original paperwork.

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W, the SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

Has the accutrigger and heavy barrel also has a jeweled bolt. Comes with a Vortex 6x24-50 scope (bi pod NOT included). Gun shoots very well, just looking to fund another purchase so this one has to go. I did add some wieght to the butt stock to help balence the longer barrel a little better and it did help out alot. Here are some other specs on the rifle its self: 



Action: Short 

Caliber: 223 Rem

Overall Length: 46"" 

Barrel Length: 26"" 

Weight: 8.75 lbs

Stock: Black synthetic with positive checkering, dual pillar bedding 

Sights: Drilled and tapped for scope mounts 

Rifling Rate of Twist: 223 Rem (1 in 9"")

I am the second owner and I have put right at 200rds through it, only thing i can say is wrong is sometimes like every 30 or 40 rds the accutrigger trigger blade will get stuck and you have to recycle the bolt handle and it clears right up (Ive looked at it and cannot tell what is causing it) Does not hurt the gun or accuracy. FTF in Scottsburg asking 500OBO or might consider trade offers but really just looking to sell at this time. Text preferred or call at 812 eight 2 zero 31 five 3"

1911-22 TARGET SEMIAUTOMATIC PISTOL cal.22LR 10 ROUNDS MAT BLACK FINISH

Featuring a completely adjustable rear sight, the finish is mat blue with polished sides of the slide. The Chiappa Model 1911 is a rim-fire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The original M1911 was a single-action, semi-automatic-pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rim-fire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun.

My wife got it at H and H and paid over $1200 for it.  I am not asking new prices.  I will take the $200 hit for it being shot once.  This is a great deal on a great gun.  It is DA/SA and can be made into a .357 with just a barrel change, you use the same magazines for either .40 or .357.

For Sale FTF Kentucky $425/Trade options below.
Actually not a Browning Hi Power but better, a Fabrique Natonale Hi Power made and assembled in Herstal Belgium, imported from Israel, where is was used by the Israeli Police forces.
It has a very small import mark on barrel and not engraved on frame like a lot of other imports. It also has a partial Star of David stamped on it.
Although this is a Mark III gun it is not truly a Mark III in that it has the front & rear dovetailed sights but has no firing pin safety. It is sometimes unofficially referred to as a Mark 2.5.
Both TruGlo and Trijicon make night sights that fit into the existing dovetails.
The gun is in overall very good condition with a recent professional re-parkerization. Barrel is in excellent shape. There are 2 areas on each side of frame that were cleaned up and cold blue applied shown in pictures. After I bought this I went through entire gun to clean it up, removed magazine safety and installed new Wolff springs. 
Actual gun is bottom in 1st picture and top one in 2nd picture.
Contact me with any questions.
Thanks for looking.

That's the upper. The lower is an Armalite m15, the trigger group is Del-Ton, the pistol grip is a larger A2 style with a trap door in the bottom and it's good for bigger hands, the buffer tube is a 6 position buffer tube and has a normal carbine stock in it. This was a fun build and I really enjoy the gun but like I said I want to move away from the AR15 family of rifles.

Comes with 8 aluminum magazines, some are colt manufacturer and the rest are other surplus mags. Good mags though. Also comes with the normal M4 handgaurds and the normal A2 pistol grip in case you want to change it back. 

I think 900 is a fair deal but I am open to reasonable offers, so if you have something else in mind, then by all means please let me know!"

I have a Ruger SR9c compact 9mm for sale. I absolutely love this gun, but have bought a few new ones and need to get some money back. This is an excellent gun, small enough to carry easily, but very comfortable to shoot. Very safe gun too. It has a few hundred rounds through it maybe, and is indiscernible from new, perfect shape. I clean it every time I shoot it and it has never seen a single issue, even when trying out gold dot hollow points. It comes with a case, a 10-round clip with the pinky extension, 17-round extended clip, gun lock, all the paper work, warranty info, and anything else it came with, I am the first owner, bought it about 6 months ago. Asking $400 obo, FTF in a public place, and I will require a signed bill of sale for ease-of-mind. Thanks!

Walther PPS - More Conceal, Less Carry

The Walther Police Pistol Slim (PPS) model narrows the margin between concealment and confidence by packing Walther innovation into an unbelievable 1.04 inch profile. It's amazing how much professional-grade design actually fits into this lightweight sub-compact. Available in either 9mm or .40S&W, the PPS packs in more power. All in all, the PPS embodies both the legendary quality and tradition of innovation that make it not just a great pistol — but a great Walther pistol.

PPS Power - Small Frame, Large Caliber

In 9mm or .40S&W, the PPS has several notable features aimed at better fit and safe performance in its narrow dimensions. From your choice of perfect-fitting backstrap (small or large) to our patented QuickSafe™ innovation, no one packs in the power and features like Walther:

OVERVIEW:

Extreme conditions call for an extreme gun. And never before has a rifle this durable and rugged been introduced to the world of hunting. The cutting edge in rifle design, the Model 700™ XCR™ (Xtreme Conditions Rifle) uses Remington’s proprietary new TriNyte™ Corrosion Control System to make the Model 700™ XCR™ virtually impervious to even the most extreme conditions. The TriNyte System takes firearm protection further than it’s ever been before by using proven corrosion-fighting materials and an innovative, state-of-the-art application process. The result is a finish that provides scratch and corrosion resistance far superior to stainless steel alone and better than any other gun on the market.

Its feature laden synthetic stock is not only stylish and comfortable, but a technological marvel.

Up for sale is a hard to find lightly used (<80 rounds)Sako 85 .300 WSM.  There were not many of these available in the United States. The only reason I am selling this is so that I can but the same gun in .338 Win Mag for Alaskan Brown Bear.

This gun boasts a 24 3/8"" barrel to allow for maximum potential of the cartridge.  This caliber was recently used to set the 1000 yd benchrest record.  Perfect cartridge for deer,elk, moose, black bear, etc.

This is a very nice rifle, excellent condition, accurate, very light and crisp trigger. It also features a free floated barrel for improved accuracy. There is light handling marks on the wood on the left side, nothing serious and did not go into the wood. The action, barrel, and bore are in excellent condition.  I clean my rifles inside and out after each and every shooting session.

Included are Optilock short bases that fit this rifle ($69.99) and Optilock Xtra low rings ($79.99)
Total value $149.98
The Xtra low rings will accomodate any scope with an outer bell diameter up to 59mm.
