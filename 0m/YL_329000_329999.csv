I am mainly interested in expanding my American Firearms section (relevant from 1936-1945, Think Garand, Carbine, Colt, and Thompson). Since I am a collector and have been for quite some time, do NOT think you can simply add an additional $200 to the ticket and call your firearm a ""collectable"". I have several American Capture Mausers, a few Lugers and a kit MG-34, several Enfields and a Sten Kit, a few Mosins (ex-Dragoon to the usual M91/30 and M44), some Ariskas and a Nambu, French MAS and a Lebel, some Carcanos, and then down to the American M1 Carbines and Garands. TRUST ME, I know what they are all worth and will know what yours is worth as well.

I am interested in the following:

An M1 Rifle (Garand)

M1 Carbine (please, NO Universal crap)

Colt M1911 (can be period gun, but I am also interested in such for a carry gun too. Carry gun can be modern. I was looking at the Compact and Commander series)

Also an Auto-Ordinance Thompson


On a side note, am interested in an FN 49 as well as some more modern S&W M&P 15 Sport rifles. 


Please, don't waste my time, I know my values and I know them well. If you don't, please don't get offended. I am not interested in LOADED UP!!!! firearms will 200 different lasers, flashlights, and other accessories. Just talk rifle and maybe ammo. 


Thanks for the time."

It's a BSA Platinum 6-24x44 with adjustable objective. Has target do recticle. Weaver style rings are with it, 2 screws are missing from the rings but seems to hold just fine with 6. There are a few scuffs and scrapes on it, obviously not new. I shot about 20 rounds with this scope on it and it seemed ok but now that my new scope has arrived I have no use for this one. New price is around $120 for the scope, so I figure $50 for scope and rings is about right.  I'm not available from mid afternoon on during the week."

This rail system by NC Star is a decent and cheap alternative to a rail mount like Parabellum Armament's $130 rail, http://www.aimsurplus.com/product.aspx?item=XPAAKARSG3&name=Parabellum+Armament+AK+Adaptive+Rail+System&groupid=64
Personally I say send the extra 100 bucks. Its worth it. the NC Star mount is attached to the topcover and doesn't have the best consistency. And if you are trying to mount any scope larger than a 40mm then goodluck because it will not fit with original mounting equipment. The scope hits the first ironsite. 
The nice thing about the NCstar topcover is that you can still use the ironsights, sometimes even with a scope mounted. The parabellum mount replaces the rear iron sight. 
In the end, the NCstar mounting solution isn't ideal for the AK. Its not a consistent rail. If you are just using a reddot then go ahead. but anything else, spend the extra money and save yourself the headache."

However, I am getting married and sadly I need to sell some projects collecting dust.

Newton Arms Co. First Series model 1916 in .256 Newton. Serial# 2419, serials match on bolt handle, bolt sleeve, floorplate, trigger guard, action bottom & stock channel. There were approximately 3900 first models manufactured with 62% being the .256 Newton. This rifle may have been one of the final First Series rifles manufactured in Buffalo. The barrel is marked with ""Newton Arms Co., INC."" ""BUFFALO, N.Y."" and ""256 NEWTON"".

The rifle has factory double set triggers, easy take-down floorplate, three position safety, multiple-lug bolt, all work well. It has been heavily used, but is in overall sound condition. The stock is solid with minor scrapes & dents. It does not have any cracks or repairs. The checkering is there, but the points are pretty flat & needs to be re-checkered. I would say the bluing is about 50% but there is no pitting anywhere. It is missing original iron sights & steel buttplate. There has been some filing on the rear bridge of the action. The bore appears to be good, but it has not been shot. The barrel is 24"" in length. The Length of Pull is 12"" to the front trigger and 11” to the set trigger. So in short the stock will need to be refinished and barrel & action re-blued.  

This rifle qualifies as a Curio & Relic. You can pick it up and pay cash. Of can be shipped via UPS with Winner paying shipping. I accept check, credit card and PayPal as payment. For credit card & PayPal payments, 3% will be added to final price. 

Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

I filed a police report immediately. I'll leave some info here, so if anyone sees a magazine fed shotgun at the range or a store, please take a look at the numbers.
Saiga 12 model IZ-109 Serial Number: H08445238 The gun is converted with a Tapco Saw pistol grip and Magpul CTR stock. It has a removable scope mount with a Millet SP2 red dot scope. Chaos Tri-rail handguard
Also in the case were 3x five round magazines and 1x ten round magazine.
I'm not from around here, I'll be heading back to Michigan in a few days, so hopefully if someone takes it there it will be recognized. If you find anything please let me know or call the police. Thanks again for looking. Joe Aldrich"

This is a must for any firefighter, EMT, or any emergency service. And the strobes are white, so they can be installed behind lenses, and used in wrecker trucks, snow plows, construction vehicles, ATV, or anything you want.

Make me an offer. I am very interested in Walther P22, M&P .22, AR-15, AK-47, Glock, or pretty much any firearm for that matter. 



If you were to buy seperately, the total cost to buy online today, would be $758.90 plus shipping and tax if applicable. The siren and speaker are LIKE NEW and the siren comes in the original box. The speaker still workd great. The strobe light system is a little rough, I have installed and moved to new vehicles multiple times, but it still works great. I just am forced to splice the wires to fit the design of the vehicles, and you will want to also.

If you are an Ohio resident, you can pick the gun up from me directly. There is however, 6.5% sales tax that all Ohio residents must pay. You can call call me to arrange a time for a pick up. I sell out of my home in Franklin Township (45005) by appointment only.

If you are a non-Ohio resident, I can sell you a firearm, and then ship it to a firearms dealer local to you. If you don’t know one, here is a website that may help you: http://fflgundealers.net/

Once you find a dealer to handle your transfer, you pay me for the gun via money order or credit card, and then have your dealer send me a copy of their FFL (Federal Firearms License) by email or fax. I then ship the gun to them, and then you pick it up from them.


We can also handle any transfer for you for any gun that you purchase elsewhere for just $15.

We will never charge a background check, transfer fee, etc. for any firearm purchased from us!"
