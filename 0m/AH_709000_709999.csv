The black PMAG and the original A3 carry handle ARE included but are not pictured.
This rifle will come AS is. It has about 250 rounds through it.
It will NOT come with the Bushmaster manual or generic sling since I no longer have that stuff. I'm willing to sell locally but if you're from another area we can arrange an FFL transfer. In that case I prefer a money order but I can take credit cards if you're ok adding 4%."

It also comes with a Blackhawk CQC paddle holster for it, as I won't have any need for it without the pistol.
I bought it new in 2010, so it's been LEO-owned since it left the shelf, and there have been no more than 1,000 or so rounds put through it. It performs flawlessly, with a super-accurate hair trigger when it's on single action (fires double action smoothly as well, but I've been kinda spoiled by single-action pistols). It's in great shape, and the only ""damage"" is a bit of holster wear to the right of the front sight (minor bluing blemish).

I'm not entertaining offers to buy the pistol without the rest of the package. Why? Because after I sell it, I'll have no need for the holster, magazines, or .45 cal ammo.

Feel free to email me if you have any questions!

It has a pinned barrel and from what I have gathered it is one of the rifles that were assembled in a hurry before the ban and the first two digits of the serial number, 91, reflect the year it was imported.
It is in very nice shape, only a few small dings in the stock. The finish is in great shape and original. The bluing is near perfect, only a couple of small scratches by the forward sling loop. The bore looked brand new when I bought it and I have only put around sixty rounds through it sighting in a scope.

The rifle comes with the spike bayonet, the original 10 round magazine, a muzzle brake, AK strap, stock button cleaning kit and the after market scope/dust cover mount. I will naturally include the original dust cover. The only part I never received and still lack is a cleaning rod.

It has a china made dust cover mount with a 4x32 compact scope. The dust cover mount is the 'third generation' that has the four set screws at the bottom to secure it against the receiver. I carefully machined it to fit and cut the right side of the 'tri-rail' mount off so that I can remove the cover for cleaning. Without the set screws tightened, there is very slight movement side to side but tightening the screws eliminates any movement and I was able to sight the scope in at 100 yards shooting 2-4 MOA with cheap, Tulammo 124 gns. Since the mount is machined to fit this rifle I would really like to sell it with the gun for what I paid, which is 40.00.

I will also sell 4 twenty round tapco magazines, used but never stored with ammo, for 50.00.

I will sell the rifle alone for 350, or with scope/mount and 4 mags for 440.00. I do not want to sell the rifle but I need the money to finish building my PSL and this SKS drew the shortest straw out of the bunch."

It's the ultimate home defense revolver. The Smith & Wesson Governor packs a punch delivering six shots of .45LC, .45 ACP, or .410 shotgun shells! 

I absolutely love this gun! I bought it a few weeks ago brand new for $762 with the intent of using it for home defense as I figured my wife (who is new to shooting) could just pick it up and pull the trigger if necessary. I was wrong! It is so powerful that after firing six rounds, she is scared to shoot it. 

I also have a bunch of high end ammo for it as well.

PMR-30
The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Light, fast, controllable, 2.850 grams of unbeatable precision.
Evolved from the trend-setting A400 Xplor Unico, this new Beretta is the ideal shotgun for upland hunting. For those looking for the ultimate lightweight semiauto shotgun here's the Beretta A400 Xplor Light. 

Developed from the versatile Beretta gas operated, self-cleaning system, the advanced design of the new A400 Xplor uses an exclusive exhaust valve that allows the shotgun to “fire” a broad range of ammunition. In combination with the rotating head of the breech bolt, the new system further reduces the already low recoil felt, directing the recoil force directly in line with the shoulder of the shooter. This minimises recoil of the firearm on firing and lends additional stability to the shotgun in firing subsequent rounds. 
In the new semi-automatic A400 Xplor, Beretta has thought of every detail in the design phase, with the utmost attention to comfort, design and maintenance requirements. The new parts design, the minimal number of components, the new materials and new anti-recoil devices make the A400 Xplor the new standard for future generations of semi-automatic shotgun."

The following is taken from CZ's website........ 

With over 75 years of experience in the design and manufacture of small arms, CZUB is today regarded as one of the small arms leader of the world. 

State-of-the-art technology, CNC machining centers and skilled personnel are the guarantees of the highest standards of quality. 

The common features for all CZ handguns include hammer forged barrels, tight tolerances and great ergonomics. 

At 5"" tall with a barrel length of just under 4"", the Compact model shaves a little more than 3/4"" off the length and about 1/2"" off the height of the full-size CZ 75. Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line.

This one has a few interesting features: first, It is non-import marked, that's right, no cheesy, ugly bill board type import mark that takes away from the originality of the weapon. Second, while it was saved from being refurbished by being in Finnish possesion, the barreled action has no visible ""Finn"" markings (except the rear sight numbers have been lined out and remarked a typical ""Finn"" procedure) and it has it's original bluing.

The rifle is in a Finnish built two piece fingerspliced stock that has one of the much rarer early copper tipped hand guards. 

It has a clearly marked matching bolt and a good clean counterbored barrel.
