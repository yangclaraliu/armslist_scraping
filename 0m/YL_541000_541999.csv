of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to small, medium and large
frame hands. The surface of the frame is the Generation 4 Rough Textured

increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable
in seconds, accommodates left or right handed shooters. The Generation 4

I could not be happier with the way it turned out. (cost me $175). My son and i took it to the range on Sunday for the first time and i was truly amazed. The trigger pull was as smooth as i have ever felt and the accuracy was as good as any gun i have shot. And i have shot alot of guns. Sounds like i am laying it on thick, but Sigs are some of the finest pistols in the world and this one lives up to that. The only reason i am trading is i dont care for 9mms all that much and i want a 1911 style .45 and cant afford to buy one right now. I am not desperate and not interested in selling. I have accs i can include for the right deal to even things out. I have 5 hi cap factory mags. Two have been shot only 50 rounds each and the other 3 are still in plastic. Also have a 10 rounder. A set of Sig factory nitesites. I had Sig put them on, but i liked the factory ones better. Also have some different holsters i can include if necessary.

Young shooters are more likely to become stewards of the shooting sports if they start with a gun that fits properly. Exactly why we crafted our standard, premium-grade stocks with a shorter length of pull, then fit them to some of our finest firearms. for 2009, all compact firearms are equipped with our new Adjustable Length of Pull System. So, fit can be customized to youngsters as they grow, and adults requiring a shorter length of pull can tailor compact firearms to their specific needs. Rifles feature 20"" barrels and youth shotguns have 21"" barrels (20"" for deer gun).

Our Model 870™ Express® Compact Synthetic rifle is everything you like about the traditional 12-gauge Model 870 Express, but in a synthetic-stock version that is virtually indestructible. Rain, sleet, snow—whatever Mother Nature throws at it doesn't matter. The butt stock and fore-end stay dimensionally stable, and won't swell or crack due to weather extremes. Stock and all metalwork have black matte non-glare finish. Comes with a 26-inch or 28-inch vent rib barrel and Modified Rem™ Choke.

KEY FEATURES:

It is equipped with a BOSS(Ballistic Optimizing Shooting System). The BOSS system allows you to tune the gun to any load making it exceptionally accurate.  Especially for a 30-06. Although you can tune it to any load I currently have it tuned for 150 grain Hornady Interbond loads. It's a very nice shooting gun with an awesome trigger pull. The rifle shows some wear but nothing more than what you would expect from some hunting use. The Rifle does not come with the scope. I hate to sell it but unfortunately need the money to pay for my wife's school bills. I am asking $950 OBO. Call Or text 918-seven9eight-9three6zero or email me.

This gun is brand new out of the box. I've never shot it. I bought the gun as a home defense shotgun. It has a 2 round magazine extension and upgraded fore-grip. I will include the gun and everything attached, shotgun ammo(slugs and shot) and anything else I can find for it. I really like the the shotgun, but it's a redundant weapon in my 
collection.

If I've left anything out or you have further questions please email me.

I think considering what your getting and what this weapon retails for $250 is a very reasonable price. But your welcome to email me and discuss things."

I've added a Mesa Tactical Urbino stock with adjustable cheek riser and recoil pad. This pad is amazing. Can shoot 100+ rounds at a time and your shoulder won't even notice it.

It also has the Mesa 6 shell side saddle, and their top rail. I still have the original screws to blank out the rail if it's not your thing, and of course have the factory trigger group pins if you don't like the saddle.

I've added a Nordic Components charging handle, because I didn't like the factory one. Also there is a Nordic Components mag clamp on the front, with spaces for rail sections on either side if you want to mount something there.

The bolt release was polished and cleaned up by Rob the gunsmith at Bowers Tactical in Centennial, to make it easier to release the bolt quickly. He also installed an oversized safety for quicker release.

I will include a ""tactical"" shotgun scabbard with as much MOLLE as you could want. Attached is a zippered pouch where I keep the cleaning supplies like a boresnake, brush and other cleaning utensils. Those will be included as well.

I'm asking $900 for the package. I'll include 10 rounds of 00 Buck as well, so this is a shooter's package, ready to take to the range. I still have the manual and an unfilled warranty card.

A very scarce original Winchester Model 61! This rifle was manufactured in 1932, the first year of Model 61 production, and wears a 24"" octagonal barrel that is chambered for .22 Short only. Has the correct magazine tube with short opening and the tang is factory drilled and tapped for tang sight. Excellent original condition with some normal handling wear but no cracks, chips, rust or pitting. The original blue finish rates 95-97% with some wear along the barrel where the pump handle travels, some finish wear to the takedown knob, and a few handling marks on the sides of the receiver. The buttstock shows a few marks, mostly to the left side, but retains most all of the original varnish. The pump handle is of the correct early small style. The mechanics are in good working order and the bore is mirror bright with sharp rifling. This great rifle comes with one box of pre-war Winchester .22 Short ammunition which was never opened (it has been shrink wrapped in order to protect it). A great little rifle that's tough to find in this kind of condition."

It runs great, nice trigger action, very accurate. The second is : Ruger P94DC ,40cal , this gun is all metal, no plastic. It shoots very good, the big 40cal has good range and lots of smack , I cary this gun as my personal wepond because it will never fail to shoot and will take down whatever I have to shoot. I was going to get the P-series set but i cannot find the 45 in the set, so i thought i would see what i could trade both for. In case you dont know, the DC stands for DECOCKER, you push the lever down and the hammer lets off without hitting the fireing pin, a very handy feature since the hammers are short and very strong ( thay can slip away from you, but using the decocker makes letting the hammer down , very easy )"

This is the easiest to conceal Glock I have every carried.  Slim, Lightweight, and Low recoil.  Never a FTF or FTE.  Check the barrel out in the pics.. no swirls or scuffs.. Very low round count.

This is a police model from 1976; from Remington: ""According to the serial number provided, your 870 P (police) was manufactured in 1976."" I can send you the serial # if you want to check it yourself. They don't build them like this anymore. Definitely has some cosmetic wear on it, but functions flawlessly. Great as a reliable home defense or truck gun. Good project gun if you want to Duracoat or Cerakote. 4+1 capacity. Cleaned and lubed and ready to rock and roll.

Tactical rifles are what I am looking for but I am open to any offers. I can travel a few miles for the right trade. I live close to Jefferson City and Morristown.

The gun has been reworked and functions as it should . Never could get it to feed Hallow points though . Had it ramped and polished but it just won’t feed them  .The only original parts are the slide , frame and barrel . It has an Wilson Combat adjustable  trigger , Beavertail grip safety , and skeletonized  hammer , and full length guide rod w/ Wilson combat 20 # recoil spring . The main spring is Colt . The Compensator is a barrel bushing comp. From Wilson Combat  ( bought through Brownell’s ) The firearm is hardened chrome , and not ever being a safe queen , it does have a few marks and small scratches .  Like I said , it has been used , but the rifling is still in great shape and it locks up tight . Original wood grips with SS Wilson Combat Hex Head Screws added .  Don’t have to sell , but have my eye on a real nice Varmint Gun . Shoot me a reasonable offer and maybe we can work something out . I am not really wanting to drive a long distance , as I did this some time ago and no one showed up .  Work with me and I can work with you  . Thanks for looking ."

533,http://www.armslist.com/posts/541533,For Sale:  5.45X39 RUSSIAN AK-74 + 700 RDS AMMO.,"NW OKC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 850,"Listed On: Saturday, September 1, 2012",Rifles,Saiga                                                                                ,5.45x39mm                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Semi auto civilian version of Russian military AK-74.  Made by Izhmash (Saiga), in the same factory, by the same workers, who make the AK for the Russian military.
   The Russians invented the famous AK-47 (7.62X39 caliber) and accepted it into service as their primary weapon in 1947.  It worked well for them as it was very simple and ultra reliable in the worst possible conditions. Although only considered a 300 meter caliber, it was a great improvement over their obsolete rifles in firepower and handling.
   But... there were some shortcomings with the 7.62X39 round.  Russian military leaders wanted greater range (500 meters +), more accuracy, lighter weight, less recoil, and MORE terminal effectiveness.  They got ALL of these improvements with the 5.45X39 cartridge.  (Google it.)
  The 5.45X39 cartridge proved to be so successful that the Russians adopted it in 1974 (nearly FOURTY years ago), and never looked back.  That is why they gave their old 7.62X39 AK-47s to dictators and revolutionaries all over the world.
   The 1st major combat the AK-74 saw was the Russian invasion of Afghanistan in the 1970s.  Locals, facing the 5.45X39 cartridge were amazed by its awesome power.  They called it the ""POISON BULLET"", because of the incredible effectiveness of this round.
   5.45X39 is the cheapest center fire ammo on the planet.  With Tula, Wolf, Baurnal, Brownbear, Slilverbear, Hornady (and others?), availability is excellent. All of the above are NON-CORROSIVE ammo.  Military surplus (corrosive primer) ammo can be found in sealed cans of 1080 rds for $120.  That's less than half the cost of 7.62X39, and about a third as much as quality 5.56.
  Rifle comes with chrome lined chamber/barrel, factory equiped (built on) scope/red dot mount, 30 rd magazine, and 700 rounds of premium Silverbear (non-corrosive) ammo. 
  Very low round count... around 120 rds through it. Kicks less that an AR!
   Perfect for fun plinking, plenty accurate for the range, and very reassuring as the ultimate family defense.

Can't believe I am listing this, and may change my mind just as quickly, but I am thinking of going to a Glock 27 or Glock 33. I would keep this to, but need the funds to buy the new one.

It has about 150 rounds through it. No marks, like new, includes Glock box and papers and loader and cleaning brush, etc. 
Ran flawlessly. I will sell it for $530.00 FTF with proof of pistol permit and license. I will include 2 Glock 26 10 round Mags with it. I have a preban Glock 17 round Mag I will sell with it for an extra $40, but that would only be to the buyer of the pistol, as I paid $50 for it recently. 

I live near Oneonta and could drive about 50 miles or so any direction from there.

The only trade I would consider is for a Glock 27 gen 4, or 33 gen 4, low round count as well.[img][URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/196/img1391nr.jpg/]"

I purchased this new in October 2011 in Arvada-the idea was to have the biggest, baddest gun amongst my friends. Since then, I took it out once and shot 15 rounds through it. I will throw in the 5 remaining rounds from the box of 20.  I also installed wooden laminate grips as show but I will include the stock rubber grips as well. This HUGE and HEAVY gun was my favorite but I have since become a city slicker and have few chances to shoot it.
I will sell to the closest price to $1,000.  I paid nearly $1,350 with tax and laminate stock I believe.

I built this to be my squirrel gun but after buying the 1022 Takedown, This not going to get used, And only selling for that reason.

This has been test fired 100 or so rounds just to make sure everything worked and it shoot great. Not one single hitch and I was able to shoot 1” to 1-1/4” ragged holes off hand at 25 yards with a Pro-Point red dot at an Indoor range. 

I didn’t have a trigger group for it when I did this so borrowed the one from my daughters 1022. So the trigger group that’s in this is 100% new No mods other than adding the Auto Bolt release.

The Break Down is as follows:

-M.O.A Corp. Stainless Receiver

-Ruger Target Stock (Inletted for the rear lug but not drill for the extra hold down, very solid as is didn't see a need to add. This stock was a New takeoff)

-New Pins and Screws

-New Ruger Bolt

-New Ruger Bolt Handle, Guide Rod, Spring Assembly

-New Trigger Group and added a Volquartsen Automatic Bolt Release

-New Pride Fowler Rapid Reticle Scope
