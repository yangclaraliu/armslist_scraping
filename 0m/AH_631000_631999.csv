I have a Sig Sauer 1911-22 in desert tan. Like most .22 autos, it can be temperamental about ammo. It does NOT like Winchester or CCI. It LOVES Federal. Includes 2 mags. I’m asking $350 obo.

Next is a Sig Sauer P232. It is a rock solid .380. Includes 3 mags. I’m asking $400 firm.

Next is a Ruger P89DC. IN my opinion, this is the best 9mm that Ruger has ever made. This is has the aircraft aluminum frame as opposed to the current polymer frames. It has a well deserved reputation for accuracy. Includes 2 mags. I’m asking $350 obo.

The genesis of modular free float rails has arrived. Building off the TRX Extreme design that revolutionized rail based hand guards; the Alpha Rail® utilizes a new low-profile locking mechanism, which offers unparalleled strength and stability. The Alpha Rail® disperses heat and runs cooler than other close to the barrel rail systems.

With unlimited mounting options and greater heat dispersion, the Alpha Rail® once again sets a new industry standard in modular free float rail design. Comes with three detachable rails and all mounting hardware. Troy® Alpha Rail® is machined from 6061-T6 hardened aircraft aluminum and finished in MIL-SPEC Type III Hard Coat Anodizing. Works with standard AR15/M16 barrel nut. Patent Pending. Made in the U.S.A. Available in Black and Flat Dark Earth.

TA648: Trijicon 6x48 ACOG Scope with Red Chevron BAC Reticle

The military's need for a magnified,self-luminous tactical sight that enhances target identification and increases hit probability on extended-range shots has given rise to the new Trijicon ACOGÃ‚Â® 6x48. Powered by Trijicon's patented fiber optics and tritium-based technology,the new TA648 ACOG reticle features a red chevron aiming point. It also incorporates a bullet drop compensator (BDC) with additional aiming points estimated for trajectory of the 5.56mm M855 out to 800 meters. To further improve target acquisition and hit potential,the new ACOGÃ‚Â® 6x48 incorporates Trijicon's Bindon Aiming ConceptÃ¢â€žÂ¢ (BAC) -- a revolutionary both-eyes-open method of aiming. Like other members of the Trijicon ACOGÃ‚Â® line,the new ACOGÃ‚Â® 6x48 is battery free and waterproof to 328 feet.

I bought it brand new and since owning it i've only gotten to take it out a few times and have put around 100-150 rounds through it so it's hardly broken in and easily in NEW condition.  It's all high grade polymer and metal (no wood stock).  The handguard system UTG and fully railed with a light (on right side not in pic) powered by a pressure switch and takes 123 batteries.  The buttstock is a retractable Tapco and I also have a detachable foregrip (not shown in pic).  If that's not enough I can even throw in an old school bayonet and of course the gun bag.  For this price the gun is a steal and I doubt will be available long, but a weapon like this deserves to be in the hands of someone who will get more use out of it.  I also have around 150-200 rounds that we may be able to work into a deal.

Very well cared for CZ 2075 RAMI pistol in 9mm. Pistol has had about 300 rounds put through it. Absolutely ideal for concealed carry! Almost reminds me of a compact 1911 style with the design.  Pistol has TRU-DOT night sights which are very bright still. Features decocker which I like in a pistol. Feels great in the hand. This particular gun was made in 2009 and is the a metal design rather than the cheaper polymer version. Includes original outerbox, case, manuals, test target, pistol, 2) ten round magazines, and 2 cleaning brushes. Hate to sell this great CCW pistol but its time for me to thin the collection a little. Buds guns online has these for $525 without night sights but have been out of stock for quite sometime with everyone wanting them for concealed carry.

****** Buyers Must Provide Copy of Drivers License and Handgun Buying Permitt or CCW to purchase or inspect firearm at the time of inspection. Please feel free to contact me with your name and phone number with questions or to set up a time to inspect the gun. I will meet at Cabelas in La Vista to show the gun. Thank you for your time and for looking!


The CZ 2075 Rami is a sub-compact semi-automatic based on the proven CZ 75 line of pistols. The trigger mechanism operates in selective DA and SA mode depending on the shooters preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block. Incorporating the CZ double stack magazine design, the little Rami accommodates 10 rounds of 9mm Luger, or 8 rounds of 40 S&W, plus 1 in the chamber. With a 3"" barrel, and unloaded weight of less than 25 ounces, the black poly coat, alloy frame Rami is ideal for concealed carry."

How does it work? Not all that well.

Kel Tecs are known for having a break-in period. This one's been fired 100+ rounds and still has issues.

(1.) Ejects spent brass in the direction of the shooter's eyes and forehead;
(2.) Fails to extract spent brass about 1 time in 20.

If you look on-line on places like Gunbroker you'll see that they ask 300 dollars or so for these. My bet is that those have these same issues---undisclosed to the buyers.

This one is being sold as-is. For a lucky buyer with gunsmithing skills and patience this could be a good deal.

This gun is not reliable enough to carry for self defense. Shooting glasses are a necessity.

The Bolt Control Group is the National Match from Young Manufacturing, that has the hard chrome finish and M-16 carrier.  I used a BCM charging handle from Vltor, with the medium tactical latch.  The upper and lower are a Spikes Tactical billet set.  Yankee Hill Machine free floating hand guard and low profile gas block.  The stock is the non-collapsible EFX Model from M.A.G.S., with an ATI pistol grip.  The lower parts kit are the mil-spec parts from Palmetto State
Armory.  A 30 round aluminum mag is included.

Quality parts throughout means this is something a little extra special.  My friendly local gunsmith checked the head space, and fired the rifle 10 rounds to test for function.  Mount your scope or red dot sight and you’ll have a very
accurate weapon that should shoot as good as you can hold.  

Compare in price to custom builds at $1500 plus, because you don’t find quality like this off the shelf.  Be prepared to exchange a bill of sale with your proper ID recorded.  I’d prefer your Concealed Carry Permit as proof.  Contact
