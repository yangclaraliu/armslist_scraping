The 4053 is the double-action-only variant of one Smith & Wesson's best-trusted 4013. The Smith & Wesson 4000 line is made up of pistols chambered for .40 S&W rounds that were designed specifically for law-enforcement use and, after some initial pushback from the buying public, were discovered to be as accurate and powerful as advertised. The 4053 slide is finished in a uniform, brushed stainless steel that is not glaringly bright and the weight-reducing aluminum alloy frame is a slightly darker color than the slide with an anodized black trigger and hammer, which adds a nice color contrast to the gun. This pistol features a wrap-around synthetic grip and Novak Lo-Mount night sights.

The Model 597 is easily the most advanced autoloading rimfire rifle ever built, and the most technologically advanced breakthrough in autoloading rimfire rifle technology in 35 years. The difference starts with Remington's proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597 all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, the 597 incorporates a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for Weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot ""hold open"" magazine feature and Remington's patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine. The 597 is coupled with a 3-9x32MM scope. It also comes with 7 magazines, and that is the reason I have it priced at $250."

The serial number is 603253, which would make the production year somewhere in the late 1920's or early 1930's. As there are no military or other nazi symbols on this pistol, it is probably in the 1930-1932 era. There is some scuffing to the finish, so I would have to say that this would be about a 75%-80% pistol. I have done a superficial cleaning to this pistol, without a full disassembly, and it appears to be functional. However, I would urge any prospective buyer to take it to a competent gunsmith for a full field stripping and cleaning before attempting to fire this pistol. Sale of this pistol MUST be done in strict compliance with all Federal, State, and local firearms laws and regulations. This means the transfer can only be done through authorized FFL dealer(s). All prospective buyers MUST be at least 21 years of age, legal U.S. residents, and not be prohibited from owning or possessing firearms. There is no warranty, expressed or implied, offered in connection with the purchase of this pistol. I invite inquiries from serious buyers only and will NOT accept any personal checks as a form of payment.  (P.S.:  I don't know why Armslist shows the caliber as ""300 Blackout"" (7.62x35mm), as I never chose that option. It must be a glitch in their system.

Kel-Tec P-40 Specs:

The P-40 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. 

The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."

What were looking for is to trade the pair for a Glock 19.

1.) First up, a Savage model 111. Its in real good condition, hasn't really been shot alot. It was bought from a friend that used it for hunting, he had a medical issue and needed money; less than 30 rounds at the time of purchase . Since then it has had maybe 100 rounds through it. Has a simmons 3x9-40 scope, nothing fancy but works. I'm unsure of the stock spacing on this model,but it does have a detachable mag. With the right deal we'll include the ammo we have for the 7mm.

2.) Next up is a ruger SR9C, this would make a great CCW, its in great condition as well under 1k rounds through it. Has a couple of scuffs on the top of the slide,nothing major. I don't have a pic of the SR9C, when i get a chance i'll post it. Low ball offers will not be answered.

Bill of sale will be required."

I have several 50-round (not 20 round) boxes of Speer Gold Dot 9mm 124gr JHP, new in the box. These are the best 9mm self-defense hollow point rounds available and even used by law enforcement.  They are highly rated. Again, these are FIFTY (50) round boxes, people. The going price for JUST the twenty (20) round box at Gander Mountain and Vance (which are sold out) is $27.99/box + tax (total is $29.87 at 1.0675% tax). If you do the math, that breaks down to $29.87/20= 1.49 per single round.  Therefore, a 50-round box at the same price (which they don't sell in town at all) would normally be $1.49ea x 50 rounds = $74.69 per 50 round box.

Using that logic, I propose a very fair price of just $50.00 per 50-round box (only $1.00/round). I consider this to be fair and not price-gouging by any means. (which I have noticed recently here on this website). Hope this helps.

I'm in the north columbus area (Polaris/Westerville/New Albany etc) and any buyer(s) would need to meet me in this general area (21 and over only).  Don't ask me if I still have some.  If the ad is listed, then they are available. Price is firm.  FTF only; I will not ship them. Thanks.

THIS WEAPON WAS TAKEN WITH CLIP AND FIVE BULLETS FROM A SURRENDERING CAMP GUARD IN GERMANY DURING WWII.     These rifles, and Dutch weapons in general, aren't at all common in this country since there were few GI bring-backs (Holland was neutral in WWI and an ally in WWII, so it would not have been legal for GIs to bring back Dutch guns even if they obtained them); further, Holland never sold any large numbers of rifles off as surplus. 
Because that carbine is unusual, I would WAG a value at $350 or so, but will be happy to be corrected by anyone with better knowledge.

It is a Dutch Artillery Carbine, made by Hembrug Artillerie - Inrichten (the Dutch state arsenal) in 1918. Those carbines were carried across the back while the artilleryman was serving the gun.

For a small country, the Dutch made/adopted an amazing variety of carbines, at least 12, plus other models for the KNIL (Koninlijk Nederlands Indisch Leger - Royal Dutch Indies Army). All were based on the Model 1895 Mannlicher and fired the 6.5x53R cartridge also used by Rumania. Loading was by the typical Mannlicher en-bloc clip which entered the magazine and remained until empty at which point it dropped out the bottom.

Hembrug is a Netherlands State arsenal and the picture illustrates Holland's Karabijn M1895. The ""W"" cipher on the butt stock was that of Queen Wilhelmina. The design was Mannlicher's, which is immediately evident given the bolt release among other things. Caliber is normally 6.5mm but a few were re-barrelled to 7.92mm.

Ammo (6.5X53R Dutch) and clips are available; I purchased both from Old Western Scrounger Inc, which I believe has been purchased by someone else but still is in business. Like most military long guns of the era, you will find that this gun tends to shoot high.

The $350 value would have been right in the ball park pre-Obama. I believe they may be worth a little more today; perhaps as much as $450

Up for bid is a lot of (17) brand new, in the wrapper, M16 magazines with the new tan improved follower.

I am a Grunt by profession, and I can personally testify that these magazines work excellent! I have used them in two wars and they work pretty darn well! Even in Full-Auto fire, these things never let me down.

""The Army has begun fielding the new 5.56mm 30 round Improved Magazine that delivers a significant increase in reliability for the battle-tested M16 and M4 weapons systems. Bolstering the already high reliability ratings of the M16/M4 systems, the Improved Magazine effectively reduces the risk of magazine-related stoppages by more than 50 percent compared to the older magazine variants. Identified by a tan-colored follower, over 500,000 of the improved magazines have been fielded to units in Iraq, Afghanistan and in the U.S."" - P.E.O. Soldier
