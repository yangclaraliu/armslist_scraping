If you want to trade I am looking for something that's compact or subcompact that's chambered in .45 ACP. I would also trade for a Sig P238.

Some .45 ACP pistols I would trade for:
Glock 30, Glock 36, Smith and Wesson M&P Compact .45, Springfield XD Compact .45, Heckler & Koch H&K USP Compact .45...

Will also take 2 or more cheaper semi-auto pistols or a semi-auto pistol and some cash on top, as long as it comes out to be worth around $600, give or take a little.


I have more pics, just let me know and I will send you all of them I have. I have lots of pics of the gun and lots of some of the accessories."

Another piece from the collection I am selling off. The firearm is in excellent condition wtihout even taking to account its age. The date of manufacture is around 1890. Barrels are in very good shape retaining nearly all of the browning. Some small flecks of what I believe were rust spots are present near the rear of the barrels but appear to have glossed over and are no longer active. No dings or dents in the barrels and bores or damage to speak of. The rest of the metal is in excellent shape with no real wear to speak of. The bores are still shiny with some scrapes as to be expected from shooting. The ribbing is in perfect condition. Stock is in excellent condition with only a couple of very small dings. The hammers are strong and rest off the firing pins. The firing pin springs are also in good order. The break action is very smooth. The triggers are smooth and light. All parts appear to be original, and the firearms has all matching serial numbers. Black Powder only. Ships individual to FFL only or C and R license holder. Please check to ensure that your FFL will accept from individuals. Buyer pays actual shipping. Let me know if you have any questions."

The bluing is almost entirely intact save some small spots with light corrosion starting. There are 3 holes in the top of the receiver in addition to the two vent holes, probably there from mounting a scope. The stock is in phenomenal shape, with no major damage, some dings, but that is all. The Bore is bright and shiny and the rifling is perfect. The caliber is 6.5 Arisaka. Bent bolt is original but the bending may have been done for use with a scope. Not sure if the sling is original. The chrysanthemum was simply crossed out. Feel free to ask any questions and I will do my best to answer them but like I said I know next to nothing about this rifle. C and R eligible. Will ship to FFL or C and R only from C and R."

If you are authorized to have this stuff then you and I both know what it is worth. Serious inquiries only. We are willing to work with you here as we have other equipment we need MORE than these guns, IE a suitable VEHICLE. I will post a few pics to show that this is legit. Respond with your contact info to get mine and discuss the transfer proposal. Thanks, and the items are detailed more below:

- Israeli Uzi 9mm (Action Arms import) with 3 mags, book and soft case. It functions and fires like new and is in excellent condition! Select fire with full auto. Rarely fired. They list for $1k-$1400

- K&K UMP .40 with folding stock, select fire, semi or full. Can be sold with or without Eotech and pistol grip light system. Sub Gun alone, used lists for over $1900, Eotech over $500 and Light over $400. Also fired very little, likely less than a thousand rounds thru it. 

- Scoped Rem 700, 308 heavy barrel with a high power variable Simmons (high end for Simmons) ask for specifics, yes bore is good and it is a TACK DRIVER. $600+-

- Def Tec 37mm Multi Launcher, 6 round cylinder. Old but functions except for an issue with firing pin not striking very hard. I do not think it will ignite a primer and am looking into this. Otherwise it cycles fine just a spring or pin issue and I realize it is an older model, looking for $1000. 

Aside from the pin on the launcher, these guns are ALL functional and in highly servicable condition and are not at all abused! Serious reasonable offers will be entertained, just make it worth me presenting the deal to my Chief!

I bought this bad boy at Target World in Hamilton Ohio about a year ago.

 Including the two original firings at the factory this thing has seen the range once. I put about 30 rounds down range and haven't touched it since. I'm including 4 boxes of ammo (1 x 100 rd box) + (3 x 50 rd box) = 250 Rounds plus two clips with 9 rounds in each for a grand total of 268 rounds. 

The price is not negotiable. This is literally a brand new gun. I do not have the lock, it's in my storage down in Florida along with the paperwork. I have the case, the gun, two clips, speed loader, and enough ammo to have fun.

I am willing to travel within the 60 mile range outside of Seymour Indiana to deliver this gun for the price above. 
I will only take cash and you will receive a bill of sale. I'm not too picky on having a LTCH considering I just moved from Florida and do not have one myself. I will require a license and will keep that information for my eyes only.

Thought it over last night, though, and decided I need to use my LCP for the time being (bought way too many .380 rounds!) before permanently switching to the LC9.  Since there seems to be a lot of interest in the LC9 I would rather someone use it now than have it sit in my safe gathering dust until I am ready.  This LC9 is one week old and has been to the range once with about 20 rounds fired.  Because it is now technically used I will sell for $400.  I will also include 2 extra mags with extended finger rests which I recently bought for $35 apiece.  Concealed Carry permit holders move to the front of the line."

I don’t like to get involved in the personal jabs that folks seem compelled to write.

But…this Saiga shotgun “craze has got me upset.  Everyone knows about the restrictions that are making these difficult to get – I understand that.  But are we collectively suffering from amnesia?
When the President was elected, everyone thought that ammo and guns would be taken away and a buying/hoarding frenzy erupted.  The world has no less steel, copper, and lead than it did 3 years ago but the demand drove prices through the roof.  

Same with the back rifles.  Everyone that ever thought of buying a gun ran out and emptied the shelves.  People charged outrageous prices for guns and ammo.  Lots of first-time shooters and collectors got taken for a really bad ride.  Anyone with a CNC started cranking out rifles so the supply caught up with the demand and eventually outran it.  What are the $2000 Bushmaster A-2’s worth now?

I just saw a Saiga in the box, unaltered, for $1000.  You all know that person paid about $600 for the thing.  Profit is okay – gouging is not and as such I will just move along.  He is fully entitled to make what the market will bear.  But are the consumers being wise and setting the price or are they just throwing money at the first Russian 12 ga. That whizzes bye?

How about these guns anyway?  Have we thought about what they are or why we want them?  Do that many of us use them in 3-gun?  Even the very top competitors say it takes at least $3000 to get them race-ready and reliable.  Are you going to make that investment?

How about home defense?  Have you shot a Saiga?  They are a lot of fun but not reliable and a terrible choice for defense.  A rock-solid Mossy or 870 can be had for under $300.  Gonna hunt with it?  I doubt it.  Will it improve your marksmanship skills?  The answer is no.  

There are as many of these shotguns around as there were a few months ago and they will go back down in price when the craze ends.  I just want to see you guys and gals ponder these points before you buy on impulse and are left wanting in the end.  Look at black rifles, ammo, beanie babies, tickle me elmo, cabbage patch kids and the list goes on.

Take a step back and ask yourself if these are really worth the price tag right now and if you really need one and can spare the money from your savings.  They are not good guns, mechanically,  and are not worth the price.  You will not likely make money on your investment and the gadgetry will wear off after about 100 shells.

Just be smart please and don’t get caught up in all this hype.   God bless, and be safe.

Thank you very much for your time."

It is built on a Denny's Guns special forged lower receiver - this is a thicker, stronger receiver than most ARs and has an adjustable screw in it to tighten up the mating of the upper and lower, taking out the ""rattle"" that is inherent in many ARs.  It has a nice Daniel Defense milspec set of internal lower parts including a nice worked 4 lb. trigger by Bill Springfield (Google him) (specially touched up, polished, new reduced power spring set), milspec bolt carrier group with upgraded extractor springs, black insert.  Magpul CTR milspec stock, H buffer and spring, Magpul MIAD grip with all the extra front and back straps, DPMS 1:7 twist M4 profile chrome lined barrel, A2 flashider, YHM Diamond freefloat handguards, Magpul MBUS front and rear backup sights, tactical charging handle.   It is a flat top so you can mount a red dot or magnified optic on it if you wish.  Also has an IKICKHIPPIES sling attachment point where the stock meets the lower receiver.

All furniture (stock, MIAD grip) is a nice OD green that looks great with the black of the rifle.

I've maybe put 400 rounds through it and it shoots great, even eating cheap Wolf ammo, though it prefers the brass stuff.  

Included is a folding bipod and attachment point.  Four 30-round black P-Mags with windows and Ranger plates attached, and one 20-round OD green Pmag.

This is a serious pistol. It is extremely accurate and shoots unbelievably smooth with both .40 and 10mm. I am north of Fort Wayne about 20 miles but willing to travel some for the right offer. I require ID verification for my viewing only to verify you are who you say you are. Prefer DL and LTCH to show you are legal. As for pricing (prefer trade)....... Cash price is $950 but will consider reasonable offers I guess. To build this gun new with everything listed and done would cost over $1200.

Trades can be even, partial + $$ or multiples are welcome:

This is NOT a Sistema or a Colt Argentine model. It is a REAL Colt 1930s A1 commercial that was only stamped by the Argentine police. This gun appears to have probably been refinished and it does have some real ware particularly on the rear sight and some on the main spring housing.   This is why I am letting this collectible go for such an inexpensive price. Many areas of the pistol are in very nice condition though. The pistol comes with two 7rd magazines.
