I have a Norinco arsenal /26\ sks with a blade bayonet and 80 rounds of ammo. This is a great rifle and it has a chrome lined barrel. These were Chinese mil-spec so it is pretty tough and accurate. Judging from the serial number it was made in 1965 but I am no SKS expert. The last digits of the serial have been blocked out in the picture but the first 3 digits can be seen. Email me for serial number info if you need the last digits.

This is an all matching serial number rifle. The bolt and everything have the matching numbers. It comes complete with cleaning kit, bayonet, cleaning rod, and sling. I am including 80 rounds of Ulyanovsk 122g FMJ ammo. This rifle has just been cleaned and lubed so it will come clean and ready to shoot.

WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR IN TRADE:

I am mainly looking for a nice pocket pistol, but will take a 12 gauge pump shotgun. Preferably something along the lines of a Ruger LCP, Taurus TCP, S&W bodyguard 380 or a Remington 870 with an 18.5"" barrel. I would also be interested in a .308 or .243 bolt action rifle, or a 20"" AR15 upper. Please feel free to send me info on what you have the worst I will say is no. (Would also like an eotech or an aimpoint)

Specifications 
The new Travelite V series binoculars incorporate several new features designed to make them more user friendly while enhancing optical performance.Nikon Travelite V binoculars utilize precision ground, multicoated optics, and high index BaK4 prisms for true color rendition, maximum sharpness and enhanced light transmission. The new binoculars use aspherical eyepiece lenses which provide a very flat viewing field and offer markedly improved edge-to-edge sharpness over many conventional lenses.The new Travelite V features large, conveniently located central focus knobs and clicking diopters. Each model in the series features 25mm objective lenses for maximum light gathering.A new, ergonomically contoured, carbon-fiber body makes the Travelite V easy to use for long viewing sessions without physical fatigue. The lightweight body incases a rugged all-metal chassis and is covered with a durable black rubber armor that provides added shock resistance and a positive grip in slippery conditions.

First off, it has a couple of problems.

#1 - The polimer frame has a crack in it by the magazine well(picture below). A friend of mine sat on this gun accidently while a long mag was in it. I noticed the next time I took it out shooting that the frame had a crack in it, I was SOOOOO pissed. The crack does NOT seem to affect the shooting of the gun. The magazine is still held firmly in the frame. I continued to shoot the gun for years after this happened. It still shoots fine, just din't sit on it again.

#2 - About 3 years after I noticed the crack in the frame my firing pin broke, this was after a couple thousand more rounds. I guess the pin wore out or something. I have not replaced it. The firing pins are readily available for about $40.00. I have always meant to get a new firing pin but I never did.

This is a working gun which only needs a firing pin. This would be a GREAT parts gun. Or, if you want, you can get a new firing pin and have MANY thousands of rounds of life left in it. This gun is a lot of fun to shoot.

I NEED money so I thought I would see if anybody is interested. It's a good deal.

With this gun you get:
    2 - 30+ round magazines
    1 - 10 round magazine
    1 - Factory IntraTec gun box
    Gun Manual and Papers

The ONLY trade I’d be interested in is a COMPACT Glock, S&W M&P, or a Kahr, all in 9MM ONLY.

I’m offering a Rock Island Tactical Officers Model (3.5” barrel) in parkerized .45 ACP with low-profile Novak sights, Hogue Combat Grips, Wilson Hex stainless grips screws, and beavertail grip safety. All the internals have been upgraded to Wilson Combat parts and the action has been smoothed and tuned by a custom 1911 gunsmith. 

The .45 has had approx 250 rounds fired thru it and has only a minor spot of wear on the rear sight. Included are the original grips, factory manual, a gun-lock, and the original hard plastic case. Also included are NINE mags, a Don Hume RH leather holster, a Fobus paddle holster, a Tagua Black belt slide holster, and a Fobus dual mag carrier. Also included is approx 450 rounds of .45 ammo. All of it is new factory ammo, no reloads. The majority of the ammo is 230 grn ball ammo but approx 150 rounds are JHP personal defense ammo from Speer and Remington.

My preference is to trade the whole package for any of the 9MM’s listed above. Your trade should be in the same excellent condition as mine and include at least a couple extra mags and some ammo.

If you want to buy the .45 outright, my prices are firm and as follows:

1911 only with two mags,  $450 cash

1911 with one holster and two mags only $500 cash

1911 with all holsters and all mags, $600 cash

1911 with all holsters, mags, and ammo, $750 cash

I don’t need to sell, I’m just trying to consolidate calibers and this is my last .45 auto.

Must be willing to meet face to face in Avon area.

Number of Rounds - 10 rounds
Type of Scope - PSO-1

Some other notes that are important 

This PSL-54C has the free floating firing pin that is brand new. It is an original replacement. This rifle really likes 200gr lead but the firing pin did not. Gun has been completely taken down pin replaced, cleaned and reassembled. It's recommended that it be used with light ball ammo

Prior to me getting it my buddy had been working on getting the scope set in for distance. It was at about 400 yards prior to firing pin replacement.

It is a single shot with a heavy barrel.  It has a wood stock that has a few small dings and scratches.  The barrel on the gun has a spot that the blueing has came off.  There is not rust on it and the spot with the blueing problem does not affect the function of the gun (looks only).  I am asking $200 for the rifle.

Please send me a message of what you have, condition, pictures if possible, and price.

I will NOT make you an initial offer on your item (its your item, you make the price).

I pay cash and will pick up in person and willing to travel, face to face transactions only.
I am not a dealer or collector, I just enjoy shooting these rifles for fun. Because of this I am not looking specifically for mint gun and not able to pay top dollar. Let me know what you have and we might be able to work something out.
Thanks"

Up for sale like new (it was shot approx.100 rds only) hard to find Armalite AR-10T 2010 Shot Show Special carbine.It has 16"" stainless barrel. It is very unusual for Armalite to make their AR-10T models with 16""barrel.Thats why they made very limited run of these. The only thing i did to the rifle, i changed regular A2 stick with Magpul PRS stock. Also there Harris style bipod, Original Armalite rings, 3 Picatini rails installed and S&W Performance Optics 6-24x42 long range scope. S&W scopes are very nice middle range class scopes. MSRP was $619,but i bought it new for $250.
Since rifle was used for 100 rds i will take off the price $100.
So here is what is included:
Armalite AR-10 rifle $1500.
Armalite rings $50 ($30off)
S&W scope $225
Bipod $50
Magpul stock $200($25off)
Trigger is Armalite 2 stage original.
1-5rd and 1-20rd mag is included
Butler creek scope covers free
Picatini rails free($80)
Also all paperwork and letter from Armalite included.
By the way you can see from pictures Letter from Armalite stating this is limited run gun.

Up for sale like new (it was shot approx.100 rds only) hard to find Armalite AR-10T 2010 Shot Show Special carbine.It has 16"" stainless barrel. It is very unusual for Armalite to make their AR-10T models with 16""barrel.Thats why they made very limited run of these. The only thing i did to the rifle, i changed regular A2 stick with Magpul PRS stock. Also there Harris style bipod, Original Armalite rings, 3 Picatini rails installed and S&W Performance Optics 6-24x42 long range scope. S&W scopes are very nice middle range class scopes. MSRP was $619,but i bought it new for $250.
Since rifle was used for 100 rds i will take off the price $100.
So here is what is included:
Armalite AR-10 rifle $1500.
Armalite rings $50 ($30off)
S&W scope $225
Bipod $50
Magpul stock $200($25off)
Trigger is Armalite 2 stage original.
1-5rd and 1-20rd mag is included
Butler creek scope covers free
Picatini rails free($80)
Also all paperwork and letter from Armalite included.
By the way you can see from pictures Letter from Armalite stating this is limited run gun.

I will also concider trades:
Glock 21SF and Glock 30SF
Springfield Micro Series 45ACP
Kimber carry series guns in 45ACP.
